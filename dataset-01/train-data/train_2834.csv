5,Demo'd PS2,"I got to demo the PS 2 a few weeks ago and I'm impressed by the system's capability. It's a step up over anything I saw on N64 and is much better than Dreamcast which I considered a subpar system. Perhaps what really hurt Dreamcast was the fact that no great games were ever really made for it. My brother pre-ordered Dreamcast, and after the initial enjoyment wore off, he was very disappointed, especially by the amount of games made for it. But Sony has hordes lined up for PS2 and the system looks smooth, the DVD player looks solid, so I don't think you should hesitate to get this system as soon as production ramps up.Ted"
3,Playstation 2 is overrated,"First of all, PS2 is not the most powerful gamesystem on the planet. 4MB of VRam is holding this system back. The X-Box demolishs the PS2 in terms of pure speed. The X-Box will have DVD, Ethernet, Hard Drive, and four controller ports built in not two like Sony. The only reason Sony wins in the long run is not games but because zombies believe their marketing and buy Sony. Don;t believe the hype. Metal Gear Solid X is coming out for X-Box so don't brag PS2 owners. There is one game that looks great and that is The BOuncer, I have to admit that game looks fantastic, but that is Square, not Sony. Wait for the X-Box and save your money and time for another system. If you want to wait for 3 months to get your system and pay 400-500 dollars just to get your system and a couple of games, be my guest, it's just money down the drain."
4,Juss check it for ur self,"Okay, of course ps2 is better than dreamcast. Dc is 201mzH and ps2 is 300 mzh. And ps2 has a dvd which is a big hit with the consumer. now if u have dc dont buy ps2, better things are to come of dc and newwer and better games are coming out in one to two years. Game cube will be a 400 mzh processor and that will definitly blow away competition but it will have a mini type cd which will carry alot less than the dc or ps2 cds. What i suggest is u could buy this but to wait for the X-Box. This system will bring new heights to gaming. It will have a 733 mzh pentium 111 proccessor and a 8 giga byte hard drive, which is bigger than most computers.The video chip made by microsoft and nvidia will kick A$$. the rest of this system is also like computers with the specs. For more info on this console check out x-box.com..."
5,PLAYSTATION 2 THE ULTIMATE MACHINE,"Playstation2 is almost coming to our store,people at coast to coast are very excited to get there hand on this ultimate machine.The machine that can play DVD movie and original PS 1 disc.Me and my older brother are not ready to buy PS2 yet we are waiting to see if this game console sell well,and what kind of game that will come out.I seen PS2 on the website last fall of 1999,I was surprise of what this console can do then playing game,you can watch DVD movie on it,now that a added bonus baby!!. I seen the graphic for the PS2 on the gamespot.com website they show the new street fighter ex and the GT2000 racing car game,I was surpris of the graphic,a very good 128bit graphic.I think Sony is a genuis to put dvd-rom on this game console,is better then buying a stand alone DVD player.Well I hope this ultimate machine well be a best seller like the Playstation 1 console."
1,Let's be realilistic,"The Plaxtion 2 is deffintly a powerfull consel. However som peaple are jus wrong about it's specs. The playstion 2 can generate 25 milion polgons per second. Hwever that nomber does NOT take into account play control(you want to be able to use your controller), In game physics(you want to be able to have the car move, the kick hit and the football player pass) and anti-alising(makes the image look good by removing sharp edges). With all this taken into account the Playstation 2 can do only do 7 million polygons per second. Nintendo Gamecube can do 9 million polygans per second with the sme things taken into account. I wonder what systemis more powerful?Duh Nintendo Gamecupe"
1,Poor sound quality,I have high frequency hearing loss due to age (63) and this ear phone is way too much on the bass and way too little on the treble. Sound quality is too muffled for my taste. I did far better with my old cheaper round earphones.
4,Costa Maya,To add to my review sent earlier today: The total cost of our room was $200US for a whole week.
4,"Reba McEntire scores with ""You Keep Me Hangin' On""","The song was great on CD and in concert. Now, as a single, it's even better!Get 5 re-mixed versions of the awesome song here only!The great dance songs becomes awesome! Bring your dance to a holt with this one!"
5,very soothing,dynamint muscle balm is a very effective product. It does not burn or is too cool to the skin. If goes on easily with out being to geasy or harsh. High recommend this product.
3,Half-hearted finish,"Sadly, Throy doesn't live up to its predecessors,Araminta StationandEcce and Old Earth. It's still Vance, and therefore a fun read. But he doesn't seem to have put much effort into this book, which seems a somewhat half-hearted effort to tie up loose ends. There's not a lot of mystery, and the expected resolution comes about, though with more callous bloodshed than one might anticipate.All in all, a decent and readable book. Definitely worth reading to finish up the series, but otherwise not interesting enough to be one of Vance's best.CVIE vol IV"
3,I can only surmise that Vance was tired of Cadwal.,"The first two books (""Araminta Station"" and ""Ecce and Old Earth"") were wonderful creations. ""Throy"" is a conclusion, of sorts: but your heart will sink when you see how short it is, and you realise that, given that the storyline had to be wrapped up, it could hardly be any shorter. With one bound, the Yip problem is solved forever. -Still, having read the earlier books, you'll want to read this one, too. Good luck finding it."
3,Cadwal Part 3,Quite a disappointment. I had expected a much more complex story after reading Araminta Station. It's almost as if the author got tired of the story and just wanted to be done with it all. Too much of a fairytale ending.
2,A serious disappointment,"I adored the first two books in this series and despaired at ever being able to find a copy of Throy on sale. Finally, it surfaced on Marketplace, and I snapped it up...to find a book about a third the size of the others, no sub plots, and abrupt solutions to plots carried throughout the other two books. ""Gutted"", as we say in the UK! Sure, the Vancian humour is there...but this is a pale imitation of the man at his best. A real anticlimax :("
4,Pretty good,"Inside T-SQL was right on track for what I was looking for, namely a better understanding of T-SQL. Overall, a pretty good manual and recommended."
2,Disappointed,Very limited coverage. Nothing about date processing. I have better luck just doing a Google search on whatever it is I'm looking for.
4,Excellent info but with complex style !,"This book is having excellent information , but reading it is not fun , its complex , sometime's boring ! , author's writing style prefers complexity not simplicity approaching demonstration of problem solving and tuning examples, also he should reduce statements like `I will show you later' , `will give links at end of chapter' , `in other book will talk about this' , in this chapter will talk about so and so then give summary then give links then ,... and the like , just write and let the reader finds out the info when it arrives .But still , it has an excellent info - IF - you can digest the meal !"
5,Excellent,"Normally I don't write a review but I liked this book enough to do so. I am a programmer not an SQL developer. I knew the basics but not the details and I had to write complex queries in SQL 2005 so I researched books for couple days before I bought this one. I have never heard of CTE, APPLY, ROW_NUMBER or PIVOT to mention few. This book at the beginning gives you the basics to understand how queries are processed internally, the difference between the types of indexes and how to read the execution plans. Then it dives into the language. Each example is well thought. The example goes over the syntax, performance and also optimization. I read all of it and did most of the examples."
3,Not a handy reference book,"Coming from an Oracle shop over to a MSS shop I was looking for a book that would provide me with the features of T-SQL, as well as act as a handy reference. The book is likely good as a teaching resource, albeit the English usage is horrible. As a quick reference, though, it's less handy than navigating the M$ online resources.A must for every MSS dba's desk? Nah. Not even close. I have a doctorate in MIS and this is exactly the kind of convoluted writing that makes practitioners wince when they see someone with a Ph.D."
5,Best Video Series for physical science,"I have used these videos in my science classroom for 7 years. I love the Tracking Speed - it is the best video on speed verses acceleration. The students love it. There are a few series that this group has made. They are really inexpensive but have become hard to find. When I got mine, you could contact ESPN Sports Figures and they send you a lab book for free-great stuff!"
4,Wonderful Videos,"I used these videos for a special middle/high school course I taught called the Mathematics of Sports. The videos are great. Some of my older students thought a couple of the videos were cheesy (my students were in grades 7th-10th). Overall, they are a wonderful set of videos that help relate science and math to sports."
3,Should have paid attention to the size,I saw the pic of this product with the wrong scale. It looks way smaller than I thought it would look. Is it supposed to be calming?
5,Works! 5 stars,"The only eye makeup remover I will use and it works too!! I have not been able to buy it at my local stores, but I have found it online! I highly recommend these makeup remover pads, they are super easy to use and sterile."
5,Gentle eye makeup remover for all occasions,"These are really awesome. I've been trying to find these for two years in the local CVS/Walgreens, but no luck. Thought to look on Amazon and here they are! Really so gentle, non-greasy, easy to apply and they lather very nicely! I hope that they keep making these :).Anna"
5,Lord Of The Rings,"This is a great book about the artwork created for ""Lord of the Rings"" that one will enjoy reading over and over again."
3,its ok,"although others may not have dropped them, causing them to break, i think buyers of this product may have put it in water, which causes the purous stone to crack when heated. wipe it with a damp cloth to clean it."
1,Rancid Smell,"After using this a few times for pizza--it soaked some of the oils from the pizza into it. There was such a rancid--horrible-- smell everytime I went to use it. I tried baking soda, etc--to get the smell out--but to no avail--I through my out--would not buy another. It did get the bottom of the crust crispy. Too bad--nice product--but needs to be improved."
3,stone can still be used,"I have owned several less-than-durable pizza stones and was very frustrated when the last one broke. So exasperated that I just continued using it! It cracked right down the middle and I found that if I align the crack opposite the axis of the metal rack and put the whole thing in the oven, the rack supports the stone and I still get great results. For calzones, which tend to be smaller and don't require the whole area of the stone, you can avoid the crack altogether. However, this even works well with pizza."
1,A flawed package,"While it lasted, the pizza stone worked great. Unfortunately, after 6 uses in accordance with the instructions provided, i.e., pre-heating the oven with the stone in the oven, and not putting anything frozen on the stone, the pizza stone split in two. The stone is too thin. The pizza cutter is cheaply made, it bends from side to side as you cut a pizza, especially if while you are trying to cut through the edge crust. The pizza peel is the best part of the package. It is the right size and weight for home made pizzas. The handle is comfortable, and the board is smooth. I have worked in pizza restaurants in my youth, and this peel is as good as anything I have used."
1,Stone cracked after four uses!,"After using the stone only four times, it craked in half while baking a calzone. Although the manual says the stone is ""very durable"", I beg to differ. I never dropped it, exposed it to thermal shock, or did anything questionable, yet the stone broke in half for no apparent reason in the middle of cooking."
3,Not as bad as some.,"I have had my set for about a month and a half. I bake bread several times a week and have been using this product consistantly for all of the time that I have owned it to bake bread on. Unlike some others, I have not had any issue with splitting even after a minor drop. The product so far seems sound. I haven't tried using the pizza cutter (don't usually make pizza) but the heat transfer qualities of this product do help give a little extra lift to my breads. My biggest issue with this set was the rough qualities of the baker's peel that came as part of it. The peel is made of a seemingly softer wood and isn't sanded to a nice smooth finish. To get the smooth surface that I required, I had to hit it with a sander or it would be VERY difficult to get proofed dough onto the stone without deflating it."
1,Same story,"Mine cracked all the way thorugh the middle on the first use, so I returned it. I read the instructions, and don't believe I violated anything. This is thin and too brittle for serious use."
1,Should have paid attention to the reviews...,"Yep, mine cracked too, on the 3rd use. I followed all instructions to the letter, and as it was heating up I heard a loud crack from the oven. It had split almost down the middle. Amazon should really consider dropping this product as an insult to their quality standards. Save your money!"
1,"Horrible, horrible product","I wish my stone lasted as long as others. I had borrowed a friend's Pampered Chef pizza stone and was so impressed with the ""stone cooked"" pizza that I wanted one of my own. It came out beautifully. I bought this set getting excited to make more pizza...it cracked the first time getting it out of the oven. I was distraught (but I got over it). I followed the directions to the letter and inflicted no thermal shock and I did not clean it with water while warm...etc... It is too thin and feels like it is made out of cheaper clay. The cutter is cheap too. The peel is okay, but get one separately. I CANNOT recommend this product AT ALL. Do yourself a favor and track down a Pampered Chef stone. It's cheaper and MUCH better quality."
5,Applauded by this Environmental Engineer PE!,"There is no better book for learning about wetlands that I have found. Many students find hydrology difficult, but this book lays this critical process out clearly, with excellent illustrations and diagrams.This book helps the biotic oriented student understand the abiotic processes in clear and simple language.I will never part with my copy, and reference it often!"
4,Good for learning the basics quickly,"This is a good book for the brand new person to wetlands, or the intermediate person who needs a refresher. I am the latter, and I have found that there are new insights or anecdotes in this book that I never knew. Also, I like the figures.I'm a fan of pictures, and there are not many of those..."
5,Better than later edition.,"Great price because it is not the newest edition, but i think it acutally is better than the newer edition. For those who care about their students and their wallets this is the version to suggest! Nothing about it is out of date, and there is plenty of great things about the content and organization."
1,Major design flaw,"While the marble itself is very high quality and looks great, the handle grip is cheap plastic and very poorly made. The very first time I used it, the wire stretched quite a bit because the handle did not hold it securely. Now, I have to re-tighten the wire almost every time I use this cutter. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product.UPDATE: A short time later, the handle broke completely. I just cannot understand why Prodyne would pair such a nice piece of marble with a really, really cheap handle."
2,Arrived Broken as Well,"I received my slicer with the wire broken. And some of the marble was chipped off around where the wire lies. Seems like it would be a good product, but doesn't seem to be very well protected in the packaging."
2,Not a quality product,"The product was received damaged. The seller promptly replaced it with a different model and informed me that his company was droping the marble cheese slicer because of it's problems. The product was not manufactured in a quality manner. The slicing handle hole in the base, was drilled to large so that the handle wobbled. It's weight contributed to the damage received during shipping. The manufacturer could have a better shipping package and packaging to prevent damage. I will not buy another Prodyne product."
2,Broken Wire,"Great price for this type of cheese slicer. The marble is beautiful, although the plastic wire holder detracts from the overall appearance of the product. Like several other reviewers, my cheese slicer arrived with a broken wire. It is is disappointing that the manufacturer does not address this shipping issue. Make sure to qualify for free shipping when purchasing this item, as it would have otherwise cost me $7.35 to ship this item due to the weight of the marble."
2,Packaging personnel needed,"As per some of the printed reviews, my wire came broken as well. I would think that the company would strive to eliminate this problem without causing the consumer the added inconvience of contacting them to replace a damaged product.How about shipping the wire taped to the cutting bar with a picture of how to assemble the wire to the cutting bar. By the time I get done contacting the these people, I've wasted time which could have been better served."
1,Spares kit needed,"This item should come with a roll of stainless steel wire and a tube of ""super glue"". The second time I used it the wire broke and one of the foot pads feel off. My main regret is that I didn't believe the other reviewers who all seemed to have similar problems. My advive to Amazon would be to drop the Prodyne line of products."
4,"Great slicer, but...","It did great with cutting the bunches of hard cheeses I had, but at the end, the wire got kinda loosened and was no longer tight like at the beginning. I have no idea how to tighten it and now the cutter is kinda useless at the moment. Otherwise, it is a great slicer."
2,Despite the good reviews,I think it is not good enough to buy it. The pictures are not that cute and the story is not great.Just borrow it at your local library and enjoy!
5,Fun and helpful book!,"I bought this book for my ""expressive"" 14 month old daughter. She has had a little screaming problem these days and I wanted to introduce the concept of quiet and loud to her so she would understand me more when I say ""Sweetie, that screaming is too loud. It hurts Mommy's ears.""She seemed to pick up on the concept really quickly after reading this a few times. We make a point to read ""quietly"" and ""loudly"" the different parts which has helped I am sure.The illustrations are so cute! This is a current favorite in our family."
5,Helping our son realize he is too loud.,Our son has had an issue with knowing how loud to be and is mainly way to loud for any situation and will make the most tolerant ears bleed for days. We purchased this book to help teach our son the difference between lound and soft noises and it did help. Great illustrations and colorful to keep the kids interests.
5,we love this book!,"we adore this book! my three year old loves it just as much as my baby. I love the illustrations and the simple narrative. my daughter's favorite part is ""burping"" at the end!"
2,Worked great....for about 3 weeks.,"I recorded temperatures with a wireless weather transmitter and it cut on and off around 38 and 50 degrees as advertised. Stopped working correctly after about 3 weeks, cutting on and off somewhat randomly at different temperatures. Once it started to malfunction it never stayed on long enough to warm the pump house. For something that often controls critical heat you would think reliability would be better."
2,"One worked, one didn't..","I bought two of these - one that turns on a fountain to keep a small pond from freezing, and another to regulate a heater to keep a small greenhouse temperature above freezing. Well, the first one works just fine for my purposes; it turns on around 36 degrees or so and turns off when the temperature outside gets to about 40, but the second is unusable for keeping the greenhouse in the 40 degree area. It won't turn on until it's about 32 and shuts off before it gets to 40. I was expecting a little margin of error (the literature says on at 38, off at 50), but not this much. So neither one really operates as advertised."
2,Got frustrated and built my own,"After buying 3 of these at another site and 3 of the farm innovation units (ALL TO FAIL AT THE WORST TIME) i decided to buy a $9 furnace thermostat, a $5 dollar 15 amp 120vac to 120vac relay and done!!!, no more screwing up. The little thermostat handles the .25 amp that the relay needs to switch on and when it does its ON!!!, and when the thermostat lets go at the temp I want, its freakin' OFF. Do a little study on relays and WOW! you can do better than these made in the CHINGHOW prison camp devices."
5,Product Purchase To Be Used With Easy Heat Cable That Was Returned,"This was purchased to be used with Easy Heat Cable and Connector that was returned, because Heat Cable could not protect the electronic valves I needed to protect. According to the valve manufacturer, the valves had to be protected with the correct ambient temperature which Heat Cable could not accomplish."
1,I simple does not work.,"Now it time to use it. The outdoor temperature is 21 degree F. Connect it a heater. Wait to see if the heater turns on. But, the heater never turns on."
1,Great idea! If only it it lasted more than 3 weeks,"Like the other reviewers here, our Easy Heat Thermostat worked great ... for awhile. Three weeks to be exact. It was exactly what we needed and wanted. Returned it for refund."
1,At your own risk,"Do not trust or depend on this product.Failed during first use with a heat lamp.Luckily I went and checked, or I would have been replacingmy deep well pump."
5,Dependable,It's nice to purchase a product that works as advertised. We use this to heat the chicken coop in the winter. Worked so well I bought one for a friend whose water pump froze in the pump house.
4,works and saves money,"I hook my heat rock for my pond to this so it will only turn on the heat rock if we get a freezing temp outside, this saves me a ton of money as those rocks are not cheap to run, and I only need it on if the temp goes below freezing. I look at it from time to time to see if its on when it should be and off when it should be, so far so good..."
4,Great Shoe,Purchased for a wedding and was not disappointed. This shoe was so comfortable my feet did not hurt that day/night and my feet were great the next day. I would recommend this shoe if you are on the fence in trying to decide to purchase. I did follow the advice from the other viewer and ordered a size up. Thanks!
4,Clark Terry,"This is proves why Clark Terry is such an enduring figure. I'm sure that ""jazz purists"" (What does that even mean?) will cluck and tisk about this, but if you want something that features Clark in 2 different settings than this CD is right up that alley. The first 6 cuts shows Clark in fine form as he does his ""straight ahead"" thing and they smoke. The next 6 cuts are his takes literally remixed, by some interesting rhythms and redoing of his melodies. As usual Clark lets us know all about jazz through his ""Mumbles"" and ""Watermelon Man"", Sing Sing Sing, and ""Take Five""are to this listener new charts for Clark. As usual he brings his unique blend of hip and sense of humor to them and they are very satisfying.Give it a try. It might not be grammy award winning, but it makes for some fun listening."
2,Not what I thought it'd be.,"This book is a total recount of the author's journey with brain cancer. It's long and drawn out - way too much detail. I thought it was a book to help others make their own miracles happen. It wasn't at all. It was totally about ""his"" miracle. Sure, you could learn from his experiences about not trusting one doctor or diagnosis. But, that to me is not a miracle. I didn't even finish reading the book because I became bored with it. Not at all what I expected."
4,"Unique, Engaging, Uplifting and Tantalizing.","I originally purchased this CD to listen to track #14 Into You because it was a beautifully remastered version that added power to the already pure emotions. After listening to the entire CD a few times, I realized the only track that doesn't belong on the CD (and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars) was track 12 ""Mark One"" which consists of an incredibly annoying voice saying ""this is the best song ever... EVER!!!"" You'll fall in love with 8. Walk on By 9. Lemon/Lime 14. Into U just to name a few... Definitely worth a try if you like dance music or experimental electronic remixes :) Enjoy!"
5,The Amazing Richard X,"I have always loved Richard X's remixes and production whether they were remixes for the Pet Shop Boys or music for Rachel Stevens or Annie. When I discovered this CD it was such a great surprise. He has some amazing guests on this and the songs are electronically vibed while having a lot of melody. I hope he does another CD now that so many remixers and producers are stepping up front like Tiesto, Fedde Le Grand and Kasade."
5,"Nissan 18"" Stainless Steel Insulated Sports Bottle",This is the best purchase I've ever made in sports bottle. The bottle will keep ice in it all day...even after numerous refills.
1,Obvious Remakes,"My late wife thought she had found a bargain, finding Vol. 1 & 2 for only $9.99. I quickly pointed out that original artists does not mean original recordings. Each of these songs may have an original member of the group singing, but they ARE NOT & DO NOT sound anything like the original recordings, with many quite a bit slower than the original.The only bright spot on this Cd is the rerecording of The Tremeloes' ""Silence Is Golden"". I have to admit that I like this version better than the original. It is done almost accapella, with a faint organ in the background to keep them on key. This one song is a must hear."
2,OUCH!!!,"Some great hits of the 60s - HOWEVER, they have ""Digital Mastering"" on the cover. LISTEN TO IT. They have remastered all these hits to the point they don't sound like they were done by the original artists.GIVE THIS A PASS!!I received it as a gift and thankfully, but I wouldn't pay for this butchering of great rock."
2,Worked for a few months,"The case worked fine for the first few weeks, before the ""ratcheting"" feature broke. The clip still worked, but the phone was able to spin around. After two months, the pin on the back of the case broke, which makes the case effectively worthless. It worked fine until it broke."
3,Holster Review,"The holster worked fairly well for about a month before the release button broke and couldn't get the phone to disconnect from the belt clip. I had the extended battery on my phone and the fit was very tight, but it worked. If the release button hadn't broken, it would still be using it."
2,Motorola Q,"Sadly, this case does not fit a Motorola Q with the extended life battery. I can not use this case for my Q."
1,Wrong Item! Wrong Item!,"The first time I ordered this item, they sent me the ""Krusell Cabriolet Multidapt case for Motorola Q Black"" even though the box does say ""Premium Leather Case with Ratcheting Clip for Motorola Q Phone."" I returned that item and today I received the same exact thing that does not match what is pictured!!! I kow so because the same items I received do not have the screen protection as pictured. What a waste of time and effort as I will be returning this one also. They obviously do not pay attention to what they market versus what they send out. BEWARE before your time is wasted as well."
4,Great One,"The movie depicts the epetimy of having guts. It identifies the qualities we, as Americans, expect in a president and not the definitive massages our leaders get."
2,Wood Handle Split After Washing,"Purchased, opened, used, washed....then the handle of the curved knife split in two pieces as it dried. The blade it self is great, very sharp and a handy size for me...too bad. Still using the other two."
1,Effin FM,"Batch of bloated ballads and retarded rockers drenched with electronic ambivalence plays like a second rate Gilmour, which would mean a third rate Floyd."
5,High Society indeed!,"This album, as a whole, is excellent from start to finish, back to front, right to left, top to bottom...any way you play it! For drum and bass heads this is a no brainer and for everybody else this is an excellent album to start with. High Society is a beautiful album-well worth the money."
2,TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE!!,"Yep... had to use my audio editing software on this one! This wouldn't be a bad CD if it wasn't for the lame commentaries at the beginning or end of some tracks. Thus, my Sound Forge steps in and makes this an almost ALL music compilation... THANK YOU Sound Forge! After taking out the garbage from the music tracks, just DELETE tracks 2, 10, 18, 21, 22, and 24. Now re-burn to a new CD with a total of 18 tracks, almost 59 minutes, and what you have now is a pretty good CD!!"
2,The Art BecomingOne's Own Shadow,For a first Album the effort was good. Unfortunately it was not my favorite genre.
1,"Dolly's supposed ""Greatest Hits""","I love Dolly Parton, but this is just simple repackaging at its' finest. This CD is simply ""Just the Way I Am"" and ""The Winning Hand"" with Kris, Brenda, and Willie and 2 cds. So don't waste your money, unless you need one of these 2 cds. This is no true greatest hits. The Dolly fans deserve better!"
4,Moonlight mood adjuster,"These ballads, all with ""moon"" themes, include the best arrangements of some titles that Sinatra recorded more than once. The recordings are older than the CD release, and represent the artist at his finest. As we know, no singer of love songs did it better; this collection is golden. Two of my favorite tracks: ""The Moon Was Yellow"" and ""Moonlight Becomes You."""
3,Mel Tormé Concept,"Interesting album by Frank, took Mel Tormé's concept from 5 years earlier and copied it. Mel's album was called, ""Swingin On The Moon""; check it out and give both a listen and hear why Frank Sinatra was a great singer but not the greatest, that belongs to Mel Tormé!"
4,Maze of Worlds is science fiction horror!,"This is a story that takes you to the outer rim of hard science fiction into the might-bes of untapped human potential & lets us momentarily dwell on the hidden terrors that exist in our imagination. Science fiction with a shiver, well done! Do check out my full review at [my website]"
3,"Old, But Still Good.","I was hoping that this DVD was something new on ""Killer Storms."" Unfortunately, I was wrong. This DVD is a double feature. One on Tornadoes and the other on Lightning. The Tornado feature is an old early to mid 80's Nova program that aired on TV many times. Howard Bluestien and other stormchasers try to guess were the next tornado will form so they can deploy the first ""TOTO"". The footage is not bad, but it is old and alot of the information is outdated. The Lightning feature is just about as good (or bad) as the Tornado feature. This is why only 3 stars. If you don't mind old footage or you collect Nova Programs, this DVD is for you. Otherwise, checkout National Geographic's Nature's Fury. It is much better!"
2,Gauge reads 20% high,"I used to use this gauge for my RV, but my $1.25 pencil gauge is more accurate. I realize that the guage runs from 0 to 160 psi, but on my autos, it reads 42 psi, when my tires are at 35 psi (confirmed by 3 other gauges). Why bother with a ""gauged"" tire pressure device, when it has to be checked by another gauge? Other than that, it's well made, but I will not use it anymore."
5,Awesome,"I finally stepped up to this item after using those 99 cent pencil gauges for years. I have a motorcycle now and I need a gauge that is accurate. Works perfectly, holds the reading until you press the release button and you can release air while it's on the tire. The rubber does have a smell at first, but quickly fades away."
2,Not what I expected,"I am an avid Corvette enthusiast, since 1963 when I puschased my first Corvette, a 1957, 283CI, 283HP, Fuel Injection, 4 Speed, Posi-traction rear end, both tops. Through the years I have purchase over 20 Corvette's, presently own a 1980 and 1990 Corvette. I also raced Corvette's in SCCA road racing for 15 years.The book was written by a Corvette's Chief Engineer, 1997-1992 and covers the usual information and history of the Corvette. It seems to mention every Chevrolet executive, briefly touching on the Corvette's highlights. Granted, it is tough to cover the Corvette's history of 50 years, in depth,in 285 pages.If you are looking for an entry level book about Corvette's, then I would recommend this book. If you are looking for a more detailed account of the Corvette, more about the nut and bolts, this would be just another Corvette book for your collection."
4,Dad liked it,"Bought this book for my dad, he LOVES corvettes and has 2... he was very happy with this book!"
2,I usually use a different brand eye drops ...,I usually use a different brand eye drops for my itchy allergy eyes. These were horrible and I'm going to continue using the brand I've been using. These eye drops really made my eyes burn horribly. They didn't ease the itching and made my eyes even redder after application. For eyes that are already irritated this product just made it worse. I don't recommend this to anyone.
1,Sent wrong item,"Was sent the wrong item. Did get my credit quickly, but was unable to reorder correct item as it was no longer in stock."
1,poor fitting cover,"I have baked bread for years, and currently use a round stoneware baker. I wanted this one for the loaf shape. It just came and I am sending it right back. These bakers work like a little brick oven, and the cover needs to fit! This one is waaay off. Not sure if I'll reorder, but I am disappointed to say the least."
5,Perfect for no knead bread,"I had been baking the no knead breads (recipes from Breadtopia) in my round Dutch ovens and wanted to try a rectangular shape. I ordered the Sassafras Superstone Covered Baker and am very pleased with the results. The baker and the rectangular proofing basket work well together. The baker produces a great shape, and the bread has a delicious, chewy crust. The baker arrived in perfect condition, very nicely packed. It has withstood oven temperature of 500 degrees. I would highly recommend this product!"
3,Sassafras Superstone Covered Baker,"Arrived in good shape, but Recipes were not included, which I considered an essential adjunct to buying this cooker. A phone call to AMZ cust. svc.(1-800-201-7575) resulted in no recipes, but a substantial discount on the cooker. Still looking for recipes and usage guide for this cooker. Understand that improper use can result in a broken cooker. Unable to locate a Web site for Sassafras product."
4,The Sassafras Superstone Covered Baker makes bread with crisp crust,"The loaf of bread that I made in this came out with a nice crisp crust. It baked the bread nicely. I used a recipe that started with a cold oven for the baking process. On one site, one person said that when they put a [different] stoneware pan in a hot oven, it broke. The directions with this one say that the oven can be preheated to 400 degrees F. I will soon find out. I would really hate it if a pan costing this much were to break from just putting it in a hot oven.The one thing that I found was that the pan with the bread was difficult for this elderly arithriic home baker to move into and out of the oven. The addition of small ears on each end would make moving the pan much easier."
5,This thing works!,This covered baker works as well as it is advertised. Dr. Ed Wood wrote that this superstone baker is great for a conventional oven. It is and more. If you want a crispy crust on your bread in a conventional oven this is the way to go.
2,Bread baker,This item is a little hard to use as the dought sticks to the rough inner surface. I just use it to roast vegetables as I now prefer to use a baking stone.
1,Made in Taiwan,"I have other sassafras purchases from many years ago and I've been very happy with them. I received this covered baker and upon inspecting it, it came with a crack more than a hairline in the inside corner of the lid. It's going straight back and I'm very disappointed. This is poor quality control and I don't even think I'll reorder. I think once the manufacturer sent this overseas for production, quality has gone down. How sad."
2,Results OK,"I live in Brooklyn, and artisinal breads could not be hotter now. I do all of my cooking from scratch, including hand rolling pastas, whipping cream with a wisk, etc. I thought this clay would make up for my non ""professional"" oven. You can make better baguettes (which I thought was French Bread) by turning your oven up to 500 degrees with a metal pan in the bottom and letting it get hot. Then mold dough into shape and score dough to put on rack over heated pan. Fill this pan with hot water and mist the sides of your oven, every two minutes for ten minutes. Take water pan out and reduce temperature to 400 for 15-25 minutes depending on preference/altitude etc. This pan makes the final rise easy, and the bread is decent; but you won't be wearing a barret and whistling ""Gigi"" since the result is a crispy bread which looks more like something from a California kitchen."
1,wrong thing sent,I ordered a round covered baker and got a rectangular one. I sent it back and was charged because 'the mistake was mine'. Rather annoying.
5,Good book dam it!,"The person going by A reader it wrong this book has rightfully earned the bluntman and chronic name, anyone who has read the entire book would know. This person going by a reader probly skiped every other line."
2,"Love Kevin Smith, but not this collection","As much as I enjoy the self-referential humor in Kevin Smith's films, comic books and TV show, the BLUNTMAN & CHRONIC graphic novel--for me, anyway--represents the point where the snake head is finally eating its own tail. So ridiculously navel-gazing as to make even JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK seem accessible to non-Smith fans, this was a real disappointment, particularly since the CLERKS comics are so funny even if you don't know all of the View Askew minutia.I'm thrilled that the upcoming JERSEY GIRL will be Smith's break from his enclosed universe, because B&C shows a deep well running very dry."
5,Cool,"I liked this book thing. It was pretty funny. It contributes a lot to the movie, which is sidesplittingly funny. Go Kevin Smith!"
1,"Not ""unscented"" or ""free of perfume""","This litter has a very perfumey odor. If you are looking for unscented litter, don't get this."
3,Born There,"Born 79 years ago on Bway. near Van Cortlandt. Lived in Kingsbridge & Mosholu areas 27 years. Drove the trolley cars, Bx.& Van Cort., University, Webster, 167 st. xtown, etc. after WW2. Fordham Rd.,3 movies and the Windsor within a few blocks. Loews Grand, Paradise and 1 more few blocks east. What an era! Skinny dip & sleep out in Botanical Gardens. De Witt Clinton Grad. 1938. Jacob H. Schiff center. Brought back many memories. Only complaint, didn't cover enuff. Faded roses are almost impossible to revive. Still a few childhood friends left from those years. Going back brought a mixture of emotions, so many are gone. elkvppast@aol.com"
5,Your leader in full-state Guitar-playing-Satch is incredible!,This DVD is priceless!A must have for any guitarist or rock and roll fan.
4,"Great, but not perfect","This is far better than the G3 video. The visual and audio are crisp. But I am dismayed that the one thing that I hated most about the g3 video appears in the Live at SF DVD also--when Joe is doing a solo, why does the camera switch to Jeff Campitelli on drums? It would be nice if the DVD focused only on Joe...forget about watching Jeff and Stu."
3,Relies too much on subwoofer.,"My system doesn't include a subwoofer, but my mains have 10 inch woofers. To take advantage of this, my receiver moves a lot of the LFE track off to my mains, and for my other dvds (30+ movies), that is plenty, sometimes too much. For this dvd I can only tolerate playing the PCM 2 channel track to get enough bass to make it sound full. The 5.1 track sounds horribly empty. The video portion is not bad, though. I'm sure it sounds good with a killer sub though, and I intend to test it on a friend's system."
2,More of the Same,"I initially had high expectations for this DVD after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and was EXTREMELY dissapointed.Any several songs are pretty impressive, but as mentioned by others, Joe's tone is very monotonous. Also, the overall sound is not that great, the bass is muddy, drums sound flat, pretty bad. I'll be selling this one ASAP."
5,amazing! Top notch Satriani,"This a great Dvd set! Every song is a masterpiece. This dvd has great camera angles. (close ups of the guitar and his playing hands.) The sound quality is great. I would highly recommend this Dvd to any Satriani fan, it's great!"
5,Satch is Incredible once again!!!!!,"This is a must have for your dvd library. Satriani clearly demonstrates what he's made of. The performance is great,camera work and audio aregreat as well. He is truly inspiring the way he packs so much emotion in some of his songs. How he paints himself on his strings is way beyond me, and alot of others I'm sure. He's an unbelievably gifted musician that will leave your jaw on the floor.If you've never been able to see him play,this is for you.If you've never heard him play, this is definitely for you. The rythmn section does a great great job delivering some demanding ability as well. Whether you're a new fan or been around for a while, I don't think you'll be disappointed!!"
2,Could've been a lot better,"Make no mistake,i worship joe. He's an incredible guitar player and someone who comes across as being very mild mannered despite all the adulation and praise showered on him from his fans all over the world! I respect him more for this quality he has. I thought i couldn't go wrong when i purchased this dvd but.. i guess to some extent i was wrong. The song list is phenomenal. Almost all of my favorite songs from crystal planet were played but it sounded just like how i had heard them on cd! I expect variation on some songs if not all of them. The stage was small.Jeff and stu (loved the bass solo) were great but that passion was missing...just another day in the office i guess. Overall, a good dvd with an excellent set list minus the fire and showmanship which is essential for any live performance."
1,where's the beef?,"I'm a 50 yr old with 30 yrs. playing and own every album Joe has made so why does this dvd rate 1 star? TONE!!!! Joe plays excellent, the filming and eq are great but every song sounds the same! If it were'nt for Raspberry Jam and Stu's solo on Love Thing this would not be in my collection. I own every guitar dvd I can get my hands on and my fellow pickers and I agree that the monotony of listening to the same guitar for two disc's kills the show. Other artist's (with endorsement) can pick up a Gibson, Fender or even an accoustic to mix things up a bit. Love Thing sounds 200% better are the album. This is an Ibanez commercial. Clapton in the recent PBS Blues Special stated that his Cream period was self indulgent-ditto for this dvd.Every concert dvd in my collection has ""magic moments"" that are awe inspiring to guitar players, I'm not talking 19 yr old death metal dudes and this one takes a back shelf."
1,In Blu-ray I hope give FIVE STARS ....,"I have this DVD and look at it over 15 times. It was great!!! I have a blu-ray player and after watch the blu-rays of Jeff Beck, NIN, Queen,etc, I just can say that this DVD of Joe Satriani has bad sound and bad video quality. I hope it comes in Blu-ray, of course if the master can be put on Blu-ray and receive a good trancription ! I will buy it !!! DVD IS DEAD !!!Let's Blu-ray, NOW !!!"
1,*** RENT IT BEFORE BUYING!!!! ***,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD AFTER READING THE POSITIVE REVIEWS AT AMAZON.BEING ONE OF MY FAVORITE GUITARISTS ,I COULDN'T BELEIVE WHAT I SAW:** VERY MONOTONOUS SOUND , ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME ,WITH NO VARIATION.** THE STAGE IS SMALL AND WEAK ,WHILE YOU EXPECT A MUCH FULLER STAGE AND SHOW.** VERY UNINSPIRING.** EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED *****"
3,Is a simple satriani video,"this video is good, I think I will buy it some day...but I recommend a thousand times more to buy !! steve vai live in astorias london! is an amazing concert, satriani is very monotonous, vai is amazing, he isn`t monotonous"
4,You Rock Joe!!!,"Not the best in the guitar playing line up, but certainly amoungst them. Nice dvd I would play more than once. Recommend highly!"
1,I'd Pay For Amazon to Take it back,"This CD should have been free. It's definitely the type of CD you could expect to find as a ""free gift"" in a bad magazine. Extremely derivitive, boring and downright tacky are just a few ways to describe this album. The ""singing"" if you choose to call it that makes me squirm. It certainly doesn't help the ridiculous lyrics that may have been written by a flamboyant 10 year old eastern European child. RUN!"
5,Ultra-Fun and Seductive Pop Music for the New Millennium,"From the first few notes of ""Juliette"" to the last bar of ""Stare at the Sun"" (the hidden bonus track from their previous EP), The Januaries are a like a breath of fresh air serving up your favorite cocktail. Very `Austin Powers' `60s pop influenced, this debut CD covers a lot of territory within while being faithful to their chosen sound. In other words, it's not a genre-hopping mishmash, but a collection of pop gems with enough variety in mood and style to be consistently interesting and truly enjoyable. Standout tracks are the organ infused ""Love Met The Devil"", ""Love Has Flown"" with it's `I'm-almost-not-sad-anymore-about-our-breakup' mixture of contradictory feelings, and the rockin' ""Black Transmission"" & ""Angel Eyes"". I wholeheartedly recommend this CD!"
4,Great CD!,"Very good CD, I highly recommend it. Very upbeat and very similar to their demo cd they gave away free on the inet. Not a bad song on the CD."
4,The Januaries,This is one special recording. The vocals are excellent and combined with the 60ish quality to the instrumentals provides an exceptionally unique sound worthy of repeated listens. It is unfortunate that the group has broken up for I believe I could become an ardent follower of their musical presentations if they were still recording.
4,A window into the home where dyslexia lives,"I am a teacher and have had close contact with families who have had dyslexic children. This author does a great job of communicating the emotion, questions, struggles, and fears that a mother has. Her son also writes vignettes at the end of each chapter expressing his own point of view and struggles and fears. She weaves into the story enough clinical information to define dyslexia, explain its symtoms, and discuss ways to deal with it. But the main impact is the author opening her heart to the reader."
3,"Nice design, could be larger","I found the design and functionality of this quite nice, but I rapidly discovered that this banana hammock could not comfortably fit my produce. I've kept using it to store walnuts and pecans however."
2,"Cheaply made product that works, if it doesn't break first","I bought this product. It does the job, provided that the one that you get holds up. Both of the ones that I bought, the posts kept turning if the food's weight distribution was 'too much' for this cheaply made product. If you overtighten the post screws, then the product is shot. On the two that I had to buy for necessity, I had to put a small finishing nail on both sides of each post in order to ensure that the posts will not turn. I need a third one, but, I may take the hammock ropes that come with this cheap product and make my own 3-tiered fruit hammock. I can make a square one (so that I can use all 3 of the same-lengthed rope hammocks), and reinforce the corners and base so that it can withstand the load. I will try to make it decorative as well. Maybe an elliptical interior shape of the wood, with a square-ish outer wood look.Overall, it works. But, it sucks, because it's cheaply made."
1,It fell apart.,I purchased this Prodyne FH-300 Beechwood fruit and veggie hammock and put it together. One of the support pieces immediately split along the grain of the wood. Gluing it back together didn't work because of the stress on that part of the support. Very disappointing! I bought it at a grocery store. Returning it wasn't an option.
1,"Good IDE, very poor documentation","I learned programming with Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo Assembler in the late '80s, continuing with Turbo C in the early '90s. After having spent a decade in the UNIX world, I recently returned to the PC, and did get the recent Turbo C++ when I discovered it.The IDE as such is very good. Both the development and debugging IDE configurations make perfect sense, and provide a very good work environment.The problem with Turbo C++ is the docmentation. It does not exist. There are no tutorials (that I can find), no code examples (that I can find), no example projects (that I can find). The documentation that does exists (well, that I do find) is short prose (~300-500 words) that state the obvious. There are the occational code snippets (<10 lines) in these pages, but the code is taken out of context and is thus not all that useful.Borland would do well to publish a couple of tutorials and developer's guides in conjunction with this product."
4,Cute gift idea,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year-old niece. She loved putting on her cute little apron and cooking her pizza (which she, of course, shared). I'm all for products and activities that help kids feel grown-up and capable. It boosts their self-esteem. I think this product accomplishes this."
2,ick....,"I was attracted to this because of the storyline....the chefs and food. What got off to a good start fell apart about a third of the way through and became nothing but a graphic sex story. They slept together asap with no setup that made sense, and then pages upon pages detailed their sex scenes. I am no prude, by any means, but this read more like erotica than a good story. I kept getting jolted out of the story by graphic details ..., etc. Very bizarre. I enjoyed her last book, the driven snowe, but his one has veered way off course....."
5,"BETTER THAN ANY USA BOXED TV COMEDY SET, INCLUDING SEINFELD AND FAMILY GUY",this is the real dealthis is comedy with a capital Kthis is worth learning Spanish for (it's easy! Unlike English it is a phonetic language)Best and most intelligent comedy since Mr. James Joyce laid down his pen forever.Dare to cry with laughter.
2,painfully de-gayed,"In the book ""Hollywood Gays,"" Cesar said he was gay and once slept with Desi Arnaz. Most sources, like Notable Names Database, say Tyrone Power was his lover. However, in this work, they call Tyrone ""his best friend."" I wonder if his brother, Jane Wyman, and other women would not have volunteered to be interviewed if his gay identity was brought up.Like Anthony Quinn, he played many ethncities in his oeuvre. When I saw so many images of him, I thought, ""Wow! He kinda reminds me of Ricardo Montalban."" Late in the program, you see a photo of the two LatinO actors together.As they say nothing of his sexuality, of course, they never note the irony of having the nickname Butch.There's good info here. He was born rich. He kept playing roles post-Joker. He was known for being a great dancer. He volunteered for World War II.Still, this was just another program that spoke of ""a bachelor,"" rather than a Pink Triangle Man."
2,Cheap,Poor quality. Straight out of the bag I had to start repairs on it. I wish I had read the other reviews BEFORE purchase.
1,TERRIBLE!,"I wouldn't even give this product 1 star. Received it today. Attempted to take it out of the shipping bag it was placed in only to have the item literally fall apart. The ""straw"" and rope were half way up the stick when I tried to take it out. The rope was half unwrapped. The ""straw"" immediately started falling on the floor. The stick had a huge notch out of it. HIGHLY disappointed. Such a waste of money. The quality of this item is not even worthy of 1 star. This will be heading back immediately in the same bag it came in otherwise I'm afraid it would fall apart trying to put it in something else."
3,An Okay Buy,"The broom was not what was expected. It was VERY small, (good for a costume for a 5-7 year old) and it was not full at all! The handle was pretty unrealistic looking because it was smooth bamboo, and the bottom was so thin that you could see the bamboo stick through the weeds. So not the best, but it came in a timely matter, undamaged, and hey what can you expect for $9?"
1,Rubie's Adult Witch Broom,"This was extremely misleading! I am 5ft 7in. tall. This may be tall enough for a munchkin, or a child never for an adult?!! Also it is very cheaply made. I will keep this for a wall decoration for Halloween, if it doesn't fall apart before then! But I will be careful of buying something like this again."
1,broom review,THis was bought for a wedding. It was decorated and set out so the couple could jump the broomIt was not used as a toy
2,Just got mine in,"The color is random, I don't know if the seller chose or if it was a mistake, but mine was not blue(it was pink). The battery didnt work at all but the ac adapter did, so I guess that's something. For 3-5 bucks you can't go wrong, especially since they really don't make stuff like this anymore. I wish the battery pack had worked though... Oh well.Overall:2 stars.Minus one for not being able to choose the color, minus 1 for battery pack not working, minus one for the inconvenience that it was. Take your chances if you really want to, but I'd just buy rechargeable batteries instead."
3,Good for introduction to video games,Good for a child who is just being introduced to video games and hasn't ever owned one. This battery pack helps for recharging.
1,Didn't work.,Never worked. I had to force it to fit my Gameboy advance I think it was designed for another system and mislabeled. I would not purchase another one.
3,Adapter great->Battery pack not at all,"To be honest I wanted this item because of the adapter more than the battery pack cause I'm not the kind of guy that goes everywhere with the consoles, I plugged it in and it worked perfectly but as soon as I unplugged it the battery light faded away :S too bad. The price is really good though, so don't expect the battery pack to be working for sure :)Note: I did charge it during 16 or more hours before the first use of it."
5,Great set of westerns,"Each western by itself is a good western. Packaged as 3 different westerns for $10 (what I paid) is what gets it a 5 star. Man from Colorado, a dark western in what can go wrong in a Civil War veteran. Man from Laramie, a strong Stewart western (best of the 3 and filmed at 2:35 to boot). Man in the Saddle, better then the typical Scott western."
3,Good For Rainy Afternoon,"Not the best westerns ever made, but good for a lazy rainy afternoon.Buy used."
1,Not Worth it....,"I bought this in October 2006 and 3 months later - December 2006 two of the items stopped working. The car charger no longer charges the phone and the hands free ear piece also suddenly stopped working. The case still ""works"" in that it stays on the phone, nothing to break on that. Very unsatisfied."
2,"2 out of 3, sort of","I ordered these items because I needed the phone charger. The cover works fine, the earpiece works o.k. (the connector did not connect as easily as the one that came with my phone). The charger quit working the second time I used it. You get what you pay for."
2,Cheap,The case and charger were great but the headset was very cheap. Its quality was poor and it barely fit in the phone. Hopefully that was just mine but I somehow doubt it.
2,Good price So so performer,"This combo set was exactly the 3 accessories that I needed for my new phone. I was excited to find them all packaged together, and, at a great price! Well, sometimes you get what you pay for...The case fits pretty well and so far seems durable, however the car charger and especially the ear bud are hard to attach to the phone ( almost impossible while your driving) and seem bulky and ill designed. If you only need the earbud or charger on rare occassions then this might suit you well. However if you use them everyday, I would look elsewhere"
2,Pay peanut price and get peanuts,I bought this primarily for the cover and hands free....But the hands free has a very poor quality ...the car charger worked once and then stopped working...Over all for 10 bucks its okay...
3,Not bad,"I only have it (well, them, actually) for 3 days.I did carefully read those previous reviews and still took a shot. I mumbled myself the worst case that I lost 10 bucks.It turns out fairly good pieces of assessories.+ the case - haven't used yet and not intend to use at all.+ the car charge - good, no complaint so far, so smelling, no smoking, and more important, it does charge+ headset - soso to good, hard to plug in first time, it needs a little force and again, it's hard to unplug. Actually I haven't unpluged yet 'cuz I am afraid it will be broken :)Overall, it meets my expectation."
3,sent wrong head set,"I like the leather phone cover - it takes some getting used to, because it hits the antenna when you open the phone. The car charger I got works just fine, but I was sent the wrong ear bud. I was supposed to get one for a Nokia 6102, but they included one for a NK 7210. I was able to return it, but it is a hassle. Just check your shipment carefully."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"The car charger did not work and the case was of poor quality leather, but you get what you pay for. After paying a total of $12.00ish for this item, I still have to go out and purchase a car charger that works. For only $12.00 it was not worth the time and money to return the goods. I would like to give this product zero stars."
3,"Nokia Starter Kit (6102) - ""Two Outta Three Ain't Bad""","For the price, I have to say I'm basically happy with the purchase, since the only item I was REALLY looking to purchase was the car charger, which works fine. I kept the case, too, which is a tight fit for the phone, and protects it well! I threw out the hands-free almost immediately, which other reviewers reported doesn't fit the phone - they're right on with that statement! It's basically a worthless component included in this kit. I went to the Cingular kiosk at a local mall and purchased a FANTASTIC hands-free for my phone!"
1,"""A Sucker born every minute""...",Received the three piece set in a bag that said it could NOT be returned if the bag was opened. How are you supposed to see if it works/fits if you don't take the items out and test them?! Duh! Car charger doesn't fit and there's no way to return it. Take my advice and save your money; or go to the store and spend a little more money and get something that works.
2,buy only if you need the leather cover,"The handsfree set is useless due to inferior voice quality. We bought 3 car chargers and all three stopped working in no time. I ended up buying an adaptor and using the old phone's charger. The leather cover is good and durable. So, my tip is buy only for the leather cover because the two other products are pieces of worthless junk."
2,1 out of 3 items,my nokia 6102 took a beating during my school year so i had hoped this 3 pack would help me save money and make my traveling between school and home easier. nope.the case is pretty good. has kept most scratches off of the phone. the car charger doesn't work. tested in 2 different cars. and the head set jack doesn't even fit in my phone... which is dispointing.case is good the other pieces not so much.
1,Disappointed,The ear piece did not fit my phone as advertised. Wasn't worth returning since shipping would have cost more than the product.
3,Three- Piece Value Combo for Nokia,I an sad to say that I have had to return the car charger as it does not work. I am awaiting a new one.
1,cheap product,The charger stopped charging after about a month. The audio quality of the ear piece was very poor.
1,really bad,the headphone doesn't even match the phone. the only thing that i got any benefit from was the charger. the charger then broke within a month. piece of ****. don't buy it.
1,Do not buy,The case that came with it was the only thing that was working. I plugged the car charger in and it was smelling like something was burning. Seems like a good deal but the saying is true you get what you pay for.
2,Disappointed!,"I was really disappointed with this product. The earpiece did not fit my phone, which is what I really needed out of this package. Although the car charger did work. I guess this is a case of ""you get what you pay for""."
3,3 piece starter kit for Nokia 6101 & 6102,"The leather case fits nicely. The car charger works just fine. The earbud attachment didn't fit the Nokia 6102 phone where it plugs into the phone. Following the warranty instructions on the card, I returned it to Wireless Technologies with a letter of explanation on February 19,2006 and haven't heard from them yet. Nothing."
5,Journey into Dancing Worlds,"Dancing Worlds, by John Sprague, is a wonderful journey of sound and rhythm. I have used this CD for dance, for sacred ceremony, and for listening at home. It is high energy music that moves you and takes you travelling. Highly recommended."
3,A Well Intentioned Story,"Anyone dealing with the suicide of a loved one or friend, I believe will appreciate the story in the movie. It's not the greatest script or acting, but it touches on a sensitive subject and I did enjoy it from that perspective."
1,Awesome...UNcensored!,"This is a kick-ass album with dirty lyrics, but the clean version of ""A Call For Blood""(the reason why this album got the PA sticker)...just sounds retarded. DON'T EVER buy this album edited!!!!!"
3,Not for younger girls,"I got this as part of the GBA bundle. My daughter is 4 and I thought it would be a great Christmas present. Mommy had to test it first, though... The first problem is that there are many screens of dialogue to get through- she can't read, yet- and they show you how to use the controls on screen through text as well. I'm going to put this away for later when she is more used to the controls and can move around better on her own. It looks cute, though, and the graphics are very nice."
5,Princess & the Pauper GBA,"I love this game because Erika & Anneliese,and Serafina & Wolfie work together.There are many fun levels and i played itover a hundred times.The mini-games are really fun too.If u watched the Princess & the Pauper movie thenu know that King Dominick and Julian are pretty importantcharacters. Thats why i think they should have added themin the game too.It would be much cuter if they were in it.But i still love it and have hours of fun playing it.If u love Barbie and the Barbie Movies then u willdefinitly love this game.I also recommend (Barbie & the Magic of Pegasus GBA)Happy Playing!"
5,All you need to know about peacebuilding!,This is such an impressive little book. The peacebuilding field can be complicated and loaded with jargon. This sometimes makes talking about peace issues seem limited to those who have academic understanding of the social sciences. What Schirch has managed to do is take some very complex concepts and make them easy to understand. This is an eminently readable book and would commend it to anyone serious about making this a more peaceful and secure world.
4,sounds good....,This sounds a great book and very useful; what a pity it's not available in Kindle format as I'm in Sudan - doing peace-building - and so can't get a copy...
1,Only sold 550 copies in Australia,"This song has not made a dent in the charts and as the heading states, only sold 550 copies in Australia, not 550 000.....550."
2,Toothbrush replacement,So far all of the brushes that I've used have been too loose fitting on the power toothbrush. I've had to throw some away because they wouldn't stay on the power brush.
2,Adaptogens,"It is a great study, a discovery that will help a lot of people. But it is poorly written. The concept is hard to follow, too many typos and grammatical mistakes. It complicates a very simple subject by convulating sentences into incomprehensible paragraphs. :-)"
4,Carbon-based training wheels,"If you've written MacOS applications or used other event-oriented frameworks, this book will get you started with Carbon-based applications and the Mac OS X Project Builder Software.The book is easy to read with great examples. It's the perfect starting point if you have a Mac OS application that needs to be converted to Carbon."
1,THIS IS NOT RICK WAKEMAN,"9/13/2004-I purchased this cd only to return it promptly. Rick does not have anything to do with this cd. He does not play on it nor does he have any producing credits. The only connection is that Banda Sinfonica did a cd of Rick Wakeman tunes and that's it. The description is very misleading so beware. Rick was home watching The Simpsons while this was being recorded!1/20/2005-Isn't it interesting that Amazon has now changed the title to ""The Myths and Legends of King Arthur..."". This was not the title when I bought it and left this review. Are they purposely trying to deceive the public?"
2,Unimaginative percussion,"I love cha cha. I love Broadway tunes. This disc is a great idea, but it is very poorly recorded. The brass gets lost, especially the trombones. It sounds like they are off in a cave somewhere. It makes me want to drink, not dance. Save your money and seek something with more pizzazz."
3,Wood Filler,"I couldn't find this product in any local stores, and I live in NYC so I had lots of places to look, so I'm happy I was able to get it through Amazon. Two complaints though: 1) Too much wood filler was used. I mean WAY too much. I'm concerned as to how this will last long term. 2) The adhesive from the tape they used to stick the label on the peal was a real b!tch to get off.Update: It split after about 6 months of weekly use. And I took care of it exactly as instructed. I can't recommend the purchase of this item. I wish I could change the star ranking I gave it, but I can't."
1,"Crummy, don't waste your money.","After reading the reviews of others, I handled these peel with care. Despite my carefulness, the peel warped and cracked within a month. Wood is too think, too soft, too something. Buy some other pizza peel."
1,Warped and split after first use!!!,"This is a very poor quality product. The wood warped after the first washing. Once it dried completely, it also split, this happened to both peels that we bought. Maybe we'll try aluminum next time..."
2,Pros and cons,"I like that this peel is a pretty decent size. I can make a good sized pizza, big enough for the whole family using it. The peel is light and easy to work with.What I don't like is that after following the directions, washing the peel lightly and using plenty of mineral oil, the peel is developing a crack in the grain of the wood which I'm sure will eventually cause it to break. The peel is also very rough and has lots of little hair-like splinters sticking up.I am disappointed that this product isn't living up to expectations. If Sassafras would address these problems it would be a good product but as it stands, I just can't recommend this pizza peel."
1,Cracked and warped after first use,I was disappointed with this product. The wood cracked and warped after the first use. To bad because the size and shape are nice.
2,Sassafras Pizza Peel and Baking Stone,I bought both items and neither stood up to the job at hand. The pizza peel warped and the baking stone broke from the heat. Both problems were probably my fault but if I were to purchase again it would be a metal peel and a heavy duty stone (hopefully with a warranty).
1,Recommend against,After two weeks during which I made two pizzas and 8-10 loaves of bread the wooden peel is splitting already with the two side pieces pulling away from the center board. My guess is either the boards used were not cured or they were cured for different lengths of time.I would have to recommend going elsewhere.
2,pizza peel,"first one arrived in time for Christmas, but was split (damaged). A replacement came right away, intact...warps (cups, technically speaking)unbelievably badly, but we have figured how to use it...OK, not great"
1,Peel split halfway up the middle the second time we used it.,"This pizza peel is relatively inexpensive, so I didn't expect it to last a lifetime, but one real use is ridiculous.We were very disappointed. We buy from Amazon fairly frequently and until now have always been pleased with the quality of the merchandise and the excellent customer service. This item is such poor quality, it should not be offered for sale."
1,Piece of Junk!,"The very first time I used this item, it separated at one of the two glued areas. It is not one piece of wood but 3. The middle piece with the handle is one and 2 pieces are glued on either side. Do not be fooled by the low price. You do get what you pay for. Spring with a few more dollars for a one piece item."
5,Take care of it and it will last you years...,"If you treat this with food grade mineral oil, it will last you forever. Be sure to keep it clean and try not to get it too wet (unless it's treated with mineral oil); getting it wet will cause it to warp - also soap or detergents should not be used on the peel.Don't be afraid that the peel is too thick; by the time your pizza is ready it is more rigid and becomes easier to scoop up."
5,It worked well for me!,I just used this for the first time today and It worked well for me. I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviews and rubbed it with mineral oil about three times and let it dry before I used it. You can get the mineral oil at the pharmacy where the laxatives are located. make sure you have cornmeal so the pizza will slide off easily. to clean I just brushed off the cornmeal and wiped it with a damp paper towel (not too damp) and rubbed oil on it before hanging it back up.It looks nice and at least on mine I haven't noticed any wood filler at all. I hang it on a nail in the kitchen so it virtually takes up no extra space in my tiny kitchen. I am happy with this so far.Febuary 2008 updateI have used this thing too many times to count now and have never had a problem. It's still in one piece I guess I lucked out and got one of the good ones. I still recommend this item I would buy again.
2,A low quality peel,The peel warped and broke after I hand washed it for the very first time. I had just taken it out of the box and had not even used it. The wood appeared soft as other reviewers had noticed.
1,Flimsy -- save your money and buy a more solid peel,"I bought this peel about a month ago because I couldn't resist the price. But you get what you pay for, I guess: it broke (along one of the lamination lines) as I was taking it out of my cupboard two weeks later for its first use. I had another wood peel for many years and this never happened. Maybe I got an uncharacteristic defect, but it did not inspire confidence in this product line. I'm buying an aluminum blade peel instead."
5,Fast Delivery and as described,This is an awesome product. I use it everytime I make pizza.... LOVE IT!
5,Just make sure you have room,"This is the real thing. Previously I'd been using a little guy that had always fallen short. The only problem I have now is it doesn't fit it any of my cabinets or my pantry it's so big (23.25"" from tip to tip and 14"" wide). I can't even hang it on the end of one of my kitchen cabinets. I still love it and use it all the time, just need to find a good place to keep it that isn't sitting on the floor. Right now I have on the counter leaning against a wall."
2,very good but one was warped,The pizza peel is very large and useful to take things out of the hot oven.I ordered 2 of these. One was flat (perfect) and one was warped on the edge. I am surprised that a good company like this would send warped products to its customers. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the defective edge.
1,Cracked and warped really fast,"We were initially impressed with this wooden peel, but after just a few uses the wood began to split and it soon curled into an unusable warp. We never put it in the dishwasher and only gently scrubbed it off with warm water. However, we didn't treat it with mineral oil. If you're going to get this thing, get some mineral oil and be obsessive about taking care of it or it'll be a waste of money."
2,"Whatever you do, don't get it wet!","Product arrived in good condition but am concerned about long-term quality. Before first use I rinsed the peel well with clean water and wiped it dry. It immediately warped and became a bowed U shape after just one rinsing. While still damp I set weights on the peel and was able to get it to flatten again. The label suggests seasoning with mineral oil for long term use but am now concerned about putting any liquids on it. Won't ever use water on it but plan to wipe it with a clean paper towel. Read many reviews saying the peel cracks in half at the joints where the wood parts are assembled, hoping that mine won't experience this if kept dry."
3,Nice but sticky!,I like this peel because of its size. I agree with other reviews who say it is a little thick at the edges but is wood so I guess it has to be. I have had problems with my pizza dough sticking to the wood even after I oiled it and flowered it and put corn meal. So I would say its a nice piece if you can get it to work for you.
5,Love it!,"Great for making pizza, from start to finish. (I even slice the pizza on mine.) The only drawback I can think of is that you need to be careful when you wash it not to let it soak up water. Mine warps when I wash it but goes back into shape when it dries. Eventually, this will probably cause it to split. I may try a metal one next time."
3,Pizza Peel,"It works OK, just a few flaws. The shape, being longer then wide causes an oblong pizza (unless you settle for a medium size pizza). The other problem is if you wash it or get it wet, the whole board curls up into a boat shape. After it drys out it returns to form though. As far as functionality, it is OK as it will allow me to shake the pizza onto my square pizza stone, it also will easily slide under the cooked pizza for oven removal. The handle, although shorter then I hoped, seems to be of sufficient length."
3,What can one say??,"Well, what can one say. It is large but easily handled. I have used it on a few occasions. Unfortunatley one must be aware that sometimes the pizza or bread that one tries to place in the oven, may stick to the surface no matter how much flour is on the paddle. I have created a few mysterious items(the best way to describe the pizza is that it resembled something that a cow expunged)It doesn't exactly make clear how it should be treated or used. But then again.It is only a wood paddle. So unless one is mentally deficient, like this reviewer who obviously can't use it properly. So use it with skill as a great pizza maker, not bad decoration or to swat unusually large flies."
2,Pizza Peel,"Maybe it's me or my method but this has to be the messiest tool in the kitchen. Think about it, you have to dust it with granular corn meal, get it under the dough rolled out on the counter - then get it on the stone, then try to get it off the stone. You will have cornmeanl all over the place. They are probably all like this, my pizza guy uses a light dusting of flour only. Good luck"
3,GOOD but not great ...,"easy installation, works fine but gets to HotTEMP is a issue on those cases im using a celeron D 2.8 with artic silver 5 and it gets idle 58 C to 62 Cbeside that it will support a low end VC only"
1,Deserves ZERO Stars!,"This Red Jacket Men's MLB Hanshin by Red Jacket is a disgrace: PLASTIC zipper, ugly graphics, cheap material and all. I cannot believe anyone ever paid $74.99 for it. I sent mine back the day it arrived."
5,The best quality,Replaced and mounting is like OEM part and handing a lot better.iim Honda master technician while choose this cause it is more quality then Honda and a lot cheaper
2,It need color pictures so badly!,"If you think this book would be a good inspiring source for your Halloween costume or for your kids' school show, think again.The ideas in this book are good but it has several big problems. First, there are no color pictures. Each entity has a hand drawn illustration for the alternation and a two inches high, whole person figure, very bad quality, black and white picture to show the final result. Since most of the costumes here need at lest two pieces of original clothing of different color and style to combine with, only if you saw a lot of board way show and hopefully remember exactly how the major characters' costumes looked like, you probably will be easily confused by those illustrations. Second, a lot of material she used here is originally costume itself (or quite fancy old-style dress to say the least) but not ordinary cast-off clothing you might think you could find in nowadays closet."
1,Save your money.,"This book might be useful IF you were working with an elementary school drama club, in a big enough city to have dozens of thrift stores and IF you had absolutely NO skills at sewing, ability to read a script OR imagination. I ordered it because it looked like it might have some useful suggestions, but it is nothing but a record of how a specific garment was changed into a specific costume, mostly with hot glue. It's not even accurate as to when various musicals are set!"
4,Agree with Salsakid34,"Ven Bailalo is a very good song, reminds me of a tune on the CD/DVD ""The Beginning"" also from Machete Music. I keep finding myself comparing all Reggaeton to The Beginning. I do not know why. I just really like that package for some reason. I have been saying such nice things about it, they should send me one for free! Anyways, getting back to Angel & Khriz, they remind me of Jan & Suppose (Camion Lleno De Gunn). Good CD. Worth buying."
1,Mistake,I never ordered this item as a gift. The person it was sent to has returned it and received the book that I did order for her.Thankyou
3,More heat from North Carolina!,"If you like the style and content of Petey Pablo, you'll like this cd as well. The only bad thing about this cd is the at-times subpar production, which makes the cd repetitive and times. All in all, I can't stop listening. I actually would give it 3.5 stars."
3,QUICK FACT,"INFINITY IS ACTUALLY FROM CHUCKTOWN, THE PORT CITY, CHARLIE-O, OR SIMPLY CHARLESTON SC. THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY STRAIGHT, BUT IT IS NOT REALLY THE RAPPING STYLE THAT IS PROMINENT IN CHARLESTON. IT WORKS THOUGH."
4,very good,"Good service, good product. Helped me sleep very well. And also very good for skin massage with a small amount"
5,It's about time someone made this subject simple!,"This wonderful reference book discusses all types of nutritional supplements, from vitamin pills to oils and teas. Two main sections let the reader look for either an Ailment (like allergies, overweight) or a Supplement (like acidophilus, garlic).Almost 100 ailments are covered, including chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. The book describes symptoms and causes, suggests supplements and exact dosages, and offers many helpful tips, properly attributed either to folklore or science.For each supplement, two full pages explain what it is, what it does, available forms (liquid, tablet, cream etc.), possible side effects, and why people use it. There's also an entire section devoted to drug interactions.In my opinion, this book is truly courageous and refreshing. It tackles a touchy, complicated topic, yet it's easy to understand. It uses the latest scientific data, but it's simple enough for a 10 year old to use. Bravo!"
3,information is good,"the book was not ""new"" it was shop worn/used. I kept the book for the information needed in side. disappointed that the cover was a mess."
5,Good Information,I t was recomeded by a friend. The book has great information!!! if you are intrested in these kind of books Also quick delivery!!!!!!!!
1,Save your money!,"I was replacing a Netgear wireless ""B"" card with this Trendnet ""Super G"" card. The old Netgear B was faster than this piece of garbage! I guess I'll never learn, ""you get what you pay for!"".Save your money!By the way, Amazon refunded my money quickly."
4,good wireless signal strength and range,I bought this primarily for its use as an access point. It has been working very well. I got a decent coverage in a two story house.
5,Good-sounding Pop,"i5 makes the kind of debut album that the Spice Girls would have released. Their self-titled debut is full of pop, techno, and pop/R&B hybrids. I'd have to say that my favorite song is the last song on the album, ""That's What Love Will Do (They Say)"". It's really honest about love and the things couple's go through. The most intimate song on the album is the Diane Warren-penned ""If I Ever See Heaven Again"". Complete with aching vocals and mid-tempo production, the song tells the tale of a lover going away. Though all the songs are solid in their own way, the only drawback to the CD is the song ""Sweet Sixteen"". Destiny's Child originally recorded this song for their second album, The Writing's On The Wall. i5 didn't need to remake this sweet song about innocence and love lost. But other than that, this album is worth the [$$'s]or so dollars thst you spend on it."
4,A great C.D. for pop music lovers.,"I heard the song Distracted at Recordtown (now F.Y.E.), a record store, when the C.D. came out. I thought it was a great song (and I usually don't love a song the first time I hear it) so I bought the C.D. I'm glad I did now, because the other reviews on this website say that they don't have any other C.D.'s and disbanded! Distracted is my favorite song on the C.D. and I also love The Recipe. Cinderella is a good song. It was also done by two other groups: 1) Play and 2) the Cheetah Girls (in a Disney Channel movie). Ladidi Ladida is a good song, too, and it was done by the group S.O.A.P. first."
3,Bruce is a Master... not the book,"Bruce's work is masterful in it's simplicity and emotion, a second coming of Jack Kirby. Although many argue, myself included, that ""the King"" can never be equalled. Mr Timm has come close. There are a few artists, comic books may it be, that can show emotions for their characters without going overboard. I can only wish that the book could have provided a more elegant way of presenting that talent."
4,Excellent,"You don't know Bruce Timm unless you've read this indepth interview. Passionnate, accurate, detailed, this is another welcome one in Modern masters Series. I won't give it a 5 stars rating as iconography unfortunately falls behind text (you can find much more on the internet). There are manys pics and drawings anyway, some unveiled for the first time. Comments accompanying those reveal a lot, kind of behind the scenes stuff about one of the greatest all time artist. A must have for Bruce Timm fans, comics books fans and animation fans alike!!"
1,Very disappointed!,"I have used this cheese slicer a few times and the wire seems to get less taut each time and does not complete the slice. Is there some way to increase the tension on the wire or is this the best it will be? If so, the product does not live up to the way it is advertised. Would like to return this item and get something that actually works. Don't buy it!!"
4,Works well,I've been a dedicated hand held cheese slicer user but the warranty expired on my favorite slicer and Trudeau quit making replacement wires. The cheap handhelds never last so I bought this Prodyne countertop style with a lifetime warranty on the wire. It's fairly small but still big enough to cut from a 2.5 lb block of cheese....and still fits easily in a drawer with other kitchen items. I've had it for about 3 months and been happy with it. We even bought an identical one for the parents for Christmas.
2,Poorly designed cheese slicer,"When you look at it, it's great, but when you bring the slicer down, the wire doesn't line up with the groove in the wood. I tried adjusting the wire but that didn't work. The slit in the wood was cut straight but the wire went off at an angle.It was very disappointing to give this to my father for a Father's Day present and have it be inferior. He solved the problem by taking it down to his shop and cutting the groove in the board at an angle to match up with the wire. Most people wouldn't bother to do that.I would pick a different brand."
2,cheese slicer,"We own one of these cheese slicers and have used it to slice various cheeses for several years. Both our children wanted one in their households and we found a sticker with the web site listed on the back of our slicer. After ordering these two, both came with the slicer askew of the cut out on the board. My husband was able to re-align the parts but this should not need to be done.While we enjoy our slicer we were quite disappointed with the quality of the two new boards we ordered."
1,Poor Quality Cheese Slicer,"The cheese slicer I ordered is of very poor quality. The metal arm isn't strong enough to hold the wire taut and the adjustable plastic handle has insufficient adjustment to make up for the weak metal arm. In otherwords, the design of this cheese slicer is poor to start with. Compounding the problem, the slicer arrived with a chipped and dented wooden base, strongly suggesting it had been abused if not used. When contacted, the seller's only comment was that it was new, direct from the factory. Hardly! Save your money and your aggravation and skip this purchase!"
1,broke after about 20 uses,"The plastic handle of this cheese slicer crumbled into pieces with normal use. As I was slicing, it just crumbled. Before it broke, the slicer never cut all the way through the cheese. I always had to lift and tear the bottom edge of each slice. I suppose I will try another brand."
2,Disappointed.,I previously bought a stainless Prodyne cheese slicer which was awesome and thought this one would be too but I was disappointed. The wire stretched and does not slice well. This happened withing a month of purchasing.
2,Okay product.,I'm not thrilled with this slicer at all. The wire at full tension still gives too much. I can cut a slice of cheese with the handle all of the way down and it sometimes will not finish the cut at the bottom. I tried to adjust the wire but nothing has helped. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it isn't made in China.
5,Ideal for yourself or a friend,I received this item as a hostess gift and use it all the time. A number of friends and family have inquired about where to get one so I did an online search. It's a perfect size for home or to take on a picnic.
5,A little Cheesie review,"I love this cheese slicer....it does a great job with little effort, and minimal expense. Our milk plants' ""Cheese store"" always had them in stock--since they closed, I was excited to find them online. I have probably given away 50 of them as gifts over the years. My kids thought it was their birthright to receive at least one as a gift at sometime in their lives!I would reccommend them to any cheese lover! Prodyne has always been great about replacing a broken slicing wire if that happens. It's a simple, but great product."
1,cheese slicer,"The wire that is intended to slice the cheese does not line up with the groove that ensures a straight slice. I simply can't make it work. I would like to return this product, but frankly I don't know how to do so."
4,Cheeseboard,I already have a cheese board by Prodyne and ordered this one for a Christmas present. it is much smaller than I thought it would be but is of excellent quality.
4,works great,works great/even slices soft cheese ------------------/would recomend this to others/shiping was fast/would buy same thing again if i needed it
5,"Great design, very nice wood, cuts nicely","The wood is high quality, cleans up easily and they even put a sticker on the bottom with the number to call if you ever need to replace the wire."
3,Prodyne 805 Thick Beech wood Cheese Slicer,"This cheese slicer looks great, but for some reason does not cut well. I don't know if the wire is too thick or the groove in the wood is too wide or what. When I make a slice, it has a hard time getting through the last bit of cheese at the bottom. Does not matter what kind of cheese. Kind of disappointing. :("
4,Very original sound,"This is one of the most distinct records I have heard recently. It's literate and smart. It's much more like the Streets than Eminem. It's indie hiphop mixed with blues and country mixed in. It has toughness about it. Buck 65 sounds like Tom Waits. He shares that storytelling quality that Tom Waits had back on Swordfishtrombone. ""Cries A Girl"" starts out with some hard beats and a flute, and begins with the lyrics ""I was raised on a dirt road, ghost town, stray dog, hole nine, a gold mine, hose downÉ"" It sounds like a narrative and poverty and hard life. In other words, this has little to do with today's hiphop scene. Buck 65 has a talent for original rhymes and word combinations. This is an important record. People will take notice."
3,Greatest Hits..... Not so Great,"Buck 65's breakthrough album. Yes, this is a collection of all his best work from the past few years. The vision and unique country/electronic/rap style is still here but he went and changed all of his original music around. An album of remixed work is what this is, and to be totally honest I like every original version better. If you hear this and like it, I urge you to work backwards and seek out Vertex, Man Overboard, Language Arts and all the original releases. I know they are hard to find, (I actually found all of them at the Rhymesayer's Fifth Element store in Minneapolis) but the original versions of ""Pants on Fire"" ""463"" and ""The Centaur"" are more than worth the search."
1,Cheap plastic,"These are basically worthless. Chrome? Cheap plastic, did not thread on well at all, they found their way to the trash can very quickly! And what was it, $3.99 for shipping? The good news is the rip off was 6 or 7 bucks! DO NOT BUY, CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK!"
2,About what you'd expect for the price,"Look nice, but the fins break off very easily. Cheap plastic. I bought these for my mountain bike and they lasted about two months. If you're really careful, they might last a little longer."
4,Unique caps! Most wanted by bike shops.,"I bought these for a buddy of mine as a gift. He said he gets all kinds of compliments on them when out riding.He also told me that everytime he takes his bike in to the shop for servicing he has to remember to take the valve caps off, because the service guys always try to keep them. Sneaky.Makes a good gift item for the biking enthusiast!"
4,4 Inches for Charity,4 Inches was a charity compilation put together with the help of Elton John. It is clear some people will do anything for charity...kudos to those who participated. Beautifully done. I pray that Mr. John's mission was a success.
3,Hitch...,"I'll be honest, I bought this disc for Amerie's ""1 thing."" I don't know why, but at the time, I had to have it (and even bidded on ebay for a British CD-Single! Thankfully, I lost, as it went for $26US!!) The rest of the disc is ""okay."" Three stars for the disc. Five stars for Amerie's ""1 Thing."""
3,dance music,what is the name of the dance music when Hitch is reviewing the other guy's dancing?? it's not on the soundtrack either!!
4,Missing one thing,Does anybody know the name or even have the song that is played in between the cut scenes sometimes. Its non-lyrical and I think it might be the same song played at the main menu of the DVD. That song/tune is the glue that holds the movie together in between these songs. I would really like to have it. Thanks.
2,First Song in the movie,Does anyone know the name of the very first song played in the movie. It's an old song obviously. It's played while we watch Hitch fix the nerd up with the sexy Asian..
2,Club Song,"I am also trying to figure out what song was playing in the club... I thought it was ""Everything but the Girl"" also or ""Sade""... I have had no luck..."
5,Cool Movie Soundtrack,"By the end of the movie, I was thinking ""I have to go by this soundtrack"". Alot of great songs, by alot of great artists.The movie was really funny ... and the music is the best !"
3,Like it but could have been better,The songs were awsome. but the only song that really was good was 1 thing by amerie. so i really think u really shouldn't waste ur money on this:(
1,What A Joke,This cd is a joke it sucks dont ever buy it or dowmload it it is terrible terrible terrible will smith is terrible too in the movie not his best movie
4,"Missed Usher, but good soundtrack","Loved the movie and the music. The soundtrack is good, but I was very disappointed not to have Usher's ""Yeah"" on the soundtrack - the dancing scene is one of the best parts of the movie for goodness' sake! Oh well, still a good CD."
3,it's ok,"it contains some of the music i liked from the movie but i found it was missing some of the stevie wonder that i really liked. like Sir Duke, which was the track playing in the trailer, and others. it's ok. just ok."
4,Fantastic and little-known sci-fi/fantasy.,"The Pastel City, the first book contained in this collection, is one of my favorite sword & sorcery novels of all time. It takes place in a burned out future where two queens battle over the fate of a dying culture. Good characters, nice pacing, interesting mix of far future and fantasy themes. I will admit I haven't read the other novels in the book. General opinion is that the writing gets more cerebral to its own detriment. I would buy this book again, however, just for The Pastel City!"
3,Interesting...,"Mr. Harrison gives us a fabled land and an appealing story. I found the first story incredible. It would serve, however, to have a dictionary handy for some of the more arcane and anachronistic terminology used."
2,More than a little disappointing,"Based upon the descriptions and reviews of Harrison's 'Viriconium' stories, I bought this book and eagerly anticipated reading it. But after reading the first long story, 'The Pastel City,' which was quite good, my appreciation for the book began to take a nose dive as I ploughed into 'A Storm of Wings.' Skipping further ahead to the short stories didn't help much, either. 'Viriconium Knights', for example, was perhaps the most pointless story I have ever come across in over 40 years of reading fantasy and sci-fi.The man without doubt has the ability to write, and considerable talent with language, but his dreary, pointless, and non-linear scribblings just ended up boring the life out of me. I was never so glad to put a book down.That's my personal opinion, for what it's worth. Needless to say, I respect the opinions of those who love these works, but evidently don't share their tastes."
2,"Pointless...get ""Dance Dance Dance"" instead","I'm sorry that I didn't do a little more research before buying this one. As one of the previous reviews said, this the ""Dance Dance Dance"" collection is much better. This one has remixes or different versions of two of Chic's best songs--""Good Times"" and ""Everybody Dance"".So unless you're looking for different versions, hit the Back button and go buy Dance Dance Dance instead of this one."
3,decent collection,"As another reviewer pointed out, the compilers of this CD seemed to go for the ""broad career retrospective"" approach rather than just giving the listener the absolute cream of the crop. Yes, all the hits are here, but a few key album tracks are missing. Others have lamented the edited versions on here, which doesn't bother be as much. Frankly, unlike so many other fans, I'm just not blown away by the music. Chic --- are at least the songwriting team --- was considered to be more musical and superior to others in the disco/dance genre. Critics darlings. And to be fair, they were a cut above the rest in a genre that wasn't exactly known for great songwriting. But listening to this music a few decades later, it just doesn't sound as potent or dynamic as it once felt. Whatever the case, the songs on here just don't grab me as much as I had hoped."
2,only half of what you need...,"This book has many basic quilting tips and a decent system for executing the photo quilts...but...if you want to convert one of your own photos into a quilt, you have to buy a computer program . The last chapter titled ""How to Make Your Own Quilted Photo Patterns"" consists of just three pages and ends with a sales pitch for the software. If you have any sort of background in art, as I do, you may find the book rather elementary, especially the last chapter. But in the end it's the ""product"" pushing I have a problem with because not only is there software for sale but many other things you could find for a more reasonable price elsewhere...like the ""distance viewer""...it's just a front door peephole you can get at your local hardware store. Actually, if you have a decent knowledge of sewing and quilting, and have a little background in art, you could use a cross-stitch pattern maker program that converts photos into charts to come up with your own quilted photo pattern."
5,Simply Amazing Quilted Photography,Simply Amazing Quilted Photo is a very interesting book. I am looking forward to creating a project using the information in this book and the other two books on this subject. Thank You
4,"Deeper, deeper","This is definitely an original horror flick that's for sure. About the first half it just seems like a story about an extremely desperate middle aged guy but very quickly takes a sharp turn about 2/3 of the way through into a torture flick. Apparently, the premise here is that this girl was tortured and abused as a child so she becomes a torturer and abuser herself. She actually sees the torture as some sort of lesson she is teaching her victims and believes you can't truly experience life until you feel pain.Creepiest moment -The way the main character, Ayumi, says ""Deeper, deeper"" towards the end.This is very light on the gore factor so this is a horror flick both horror light weights and hardcore horror fans such as myself can enjoy. If you are coming into this expecting splatterfest 2011 look elsewhere."
2,She Said tops the charts,Excellent and catchy song. Makes you want to hum it all day......can't wait to hear more.
5,Brie Larson is a Star on the Rise,"After seeing the movies she's been in, I decided to check out Brie's website in December.She is the next big star on the rise. Unlike Hilary and Lindsay, she is a talented actress and singer. She does a good job with vocals.I highly recommend buying the single or waiting for when ""Finally Coming Out of P.E."" hits the shelfs in the summer. She is the real deal! I won't be surprised to see her hosting SNL or making appearances on the late night shows."
5,Brie Larson Shines Bright!!!,"5 Stars for Brie Larson's new single ""She Said"" on her upcoming Album, Finally out of P.E. which hits stores soon! Brie is an awesome and talented young girl. She has a great head on her shoulders, and she is just great all around! I highly recommend her CD to anyone who wants to hear great music from an wonderful young girl! So check her out! You won't be disappointed!~Emma"
5,Great song!,Awsome vocals backed with a great beat shes Definitely going to blowup on MTV.worth buying a 2 track single from a new comer' my answer YESyou get to enjoy the original plus an instrumental version.
5,buy this cd a review from kevin f,this girl can sing she has a great voice she will make it big in the world and will make millons of fans in money
4,Brie's Awesome!,"Not only is Brie an awesome actress, but she has an awesome voice as well. When I heard that she had a single coming out, I was a little iffy about it because in the past actors/actresses that go from acting to singing don't always have the best vocal ablility, but Brie proved that wrong."
5,I Say,"I say that Brie Larson's ""She Said"" is sure to be a big hit!! But Brie an even bigger star!!! I love her acting, and now i love her singing!"
5,Amazing!,"This is an amazing song. It's very catchy, and has a good beat. It's a great song to dance to... A must-have in all Pop music collections."
5,Awesome!,This song and music vid is awesome! Brie Larson has great talent! I can't wait until her CD comes out in stores! Hopefully you will buy her CD and give her support!
5,Excellent Flatpicking Technique Coaching,"Steve Kaufman delivers yet another great DVD on flatpicking. This time concentrating on speed. In some ways it is difficult to review Steve's work because he nails it every time with excellent, professional teaching. This is a good solid DVD to help you build speed if you are a flatpicker. Pretty much aimed only at Bluegrass and Celtic flatpickers, Steve goes through all the basics to get your speed up - its just like he's sat the next to you and doing a lesson live - trust me I'm a guitar teacher - AND I have sat next to Steve and done lessons with him teaching me this material. This DVD is the nearest you'll get to the real deal, but you'll have no travelling to visit him, or a socking great $600 airfare to Tenesssee like I did!"
4,Nicely made product - Problematic with 2nd row captains chairs,I have two large dogs (a lab and a rottweiler) who destroyed the doors of my beloved 4Runner. When purchasing my new Ford Expedition recently I was determined not to let the dogs ruin this vehicle by keeping them confined to the back. The partition was a great way to solve this issue and installation was relatively easy. However due to the size of my vehicle and the fact that I have captain's chairs for the second row instead of a bench seat it was difficult to get the ideal level for the lower bar so that my lab couldn't wiggle her way under it. In the end my husband had to make some adjustments to the bars using a hacksaw but for the most part it has worked out. It doesn't rattle which is a huge plus and it is really well made. This item was definitely worth the investment but I just wish I had known before purchasing it that it might be an issue with the 2nd row captain's chairs.
3,Not Perfect But a Good Grill,"Overall, the grill arrived timely in good condition. The instruction manual was not clear and sorting out the many pieces was not fun. One of the holes in the body of the grill was drilled with the incorrect spacing to attach the bracket. However, Ducane's customer service was great when I called with the problems, and they had offered to replace any missing or damaged parts. The Smoke-It tray is a bit small and watch out for the flare ups when the cover is closed."
1,I would NEVER order Ducane again!,Let me 1st say that Amazon delivered and then pick-up this item as agreed. The Ducane Bar-B-Que arrived in horid condition. The box looked like it was dropped from 10ft. The rotisserie rod was bent in a curve. There was paint dripping and bubbling on a one of the parts and the paint was competely chipped on the inside rim of the Bar-B-Que. For over $700 you would think that the parts would be inspected carefuly before packing and shipping.I would not recommend purchasing this item.
2,Just so-so,"I was mostly disappointed with this purchase. The clips broke immediately when I had to pull the piece out. When I contacted the company, they were almost rude about it. Also the kit doesn't fit flush with the dash. The definite up side was the wiring guide that came with it."
2,So-so,"I remember when ""No Matter What"" came out on the radio and I thought, ""Did the Beatles reunite?!!!"" I hoped Badfinger would be the ""new Beatles"" and bought ""Straight Up"". After recently buying this CD, I was disappointed to the point that tonight I put ""Straight Up"" on my wishlist to replace the album. I bought this CD mostly for ""No Matter What"", otherwise I would sell it. If you want non-stop GREAT songs from Badfinger, there is nothing better than ""Straight Up""."
1,Capitol Kills The Golden Goose Time After Time,"Capitol released a fairly representative Badfinger greatest hits package, although later Warner Bros. releases were not included at the time, a few years back. Now the savvy Captiol folks have released yet another greatest hits package that covers all the well worn hits released a few years back with some Warner Bors. cuts to complete the histroy of the band. Captiol really dropped the ball by not adding some previously unrealesed tracks from Badfinger or The Ivey's. ..."
3,the very best of badfinger[original recordings remasterde],"not enough warner bros. this is the most complete collection of badfinger's apple label hits and the big improvement over the prieviously best of badfinger is the LP version of baby blue on this new release over the US single mix on apple's cd.but there are to many early songs which is not the sound that there known for,which is power pop rock.some great WB songs are not here,song for a lost friend,shine on,why don't we talk[one of tom evans better songs],no one knows.some of there best work is on WB.but one of joey mollands best songs is here,love theme.but this is a great cd for one who start a badfinger collection.badfinger's greatest vol.2 would be good to have with this one for staters.if youre a hardcore fan like me youll have to buy all there WB cd's to get all the great songs they haveon that label.bottom line very good CD that could have been great."
5,great music,i grew up with this band and i am glad i bought it in cd form to listen to it in my garage while i build my muscle car that may have had badfinger music playing on its radio back in the day!
4,Those were the days my friend!,"In the early seventies, Bad finger represented an adequate link between the tradition and the new. Since the days of ""The strawberry statement"" they were widely known through his well reminded ""Day after day"". And since then, his presence established a perfect balance between the pop and the soft rock, simple melodies, but filled of inspiration and expansive creativity.This band was fundamental during the emerging Seventies Decade and his style still maintains freshness and style."
4,The essential tracks are here...,"Badfinger perfectly captured the sound and attitude of the popular music of the time. Indeed, many of these songs are as good as anything released in the early 1970s (Come and Get It, Day After Day, No Matter What). The band also had a way with a Beatle-esque ballad (as evidenced by the hit Without You, and Carry On Til Tomorrow). Not all of the material on this collection is as strong, and some tracks (like Apple of my Eye) are noticibly absent - but that's a common complaint when evaluating ""Best Of"" compilations. The essenial tracks are here, and there should be enough to keep you rocking for a long time. Recommended."
4,Must have for your Badfinger collection,"Just a note that this is a great CD for any music fan, especially one who grew up with the Beatles and then after the break up followed Badfinger, the Raspberries, and Big Star. The familiar hits are great and most of the other selections are fine also. One note - if you only know the hits listen to the WB Wish You Were Here tracks. That Badfinger album is not only the best record Badfinger ever did - it ranks up with the greatest ever. One gripe - Where is ""Some Other Time"" from the WB Wish album?"
5,Truly a walk in the park.,"This book did it all, I learned more about stocks and purchases from this one book than any other. The information in this book takes you from the first step all the way to purchases. This book is the credit for my recent stock portfolio. And for that I Thank the author for a job very well done. I am an inexperienced investor who needed a mentor and teacher, this book/author filled that need. Outstanding, I read it cover to cover several times."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the book hoping to learn a few more things about DRIP investing, and did not learn a thing! I am sure that the book was good when it was written (especially the first edition), but there is simply TOO much free information available today.I gave the book a sympathetic 2 stars because Carlson is (or was) the DRIP guru."
1,Waste of Money. Out of Dated Investment instrument,"I read this book and would say this is a non-sense book. Who would bother the hassle to read this book and buy stcok directly from a compay if an online transcation (e.g, datek, eTrade, etc) only costs you a tiny amount of money? The Price of the book allows you to execute two instant online transactions.Don't buy it. Please. I have already wasted my money."
4,very Good Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was a very good book for a economical price. I was quite impressed with its content!It brought out a lot of feelings I did'nt realize I had.
4,Nice Summer Reading,This is a easy read book to read to pass the time during the lazy days of summer. It is well written and easy to follow. The characters are well developed so you come to know them personally. There are numerous sub plots that add to the overall story. Over all an enjoyable read!
3,"great premise, good characters, but too preachy","I love Christian fiction, but I hate being preached at when I read fiction.I love that this isn't what you expect. One woman has an abortion, another is still childless. There isn't the ""magic"" of the one deciding to not abort and giving her child to the childless woman. Knowing this is what appealed to me. I don't like ""easy answer"" cliche stories.The first half of the book was excellent. The second half is preachy and I skimmed through it because I wanted to see what happened to the characters. Unfortunately, very real characters in the beginning became flat by the end.I think the author was very brave to share this story and I'm glad it is out there. I just wish it ended as great as it began: without cliched storylines, with deep real individual characters and without the nearly perfect ""happily ever after""."
4,Rain Dance,"I fell into the book in the first chapter. Great plot, well written and identifiable characters, and easy to read."
5,awesome book,"This was my first (free) ebook I have read - on my laptop (yet to buy a kindle) ---This story was awesome and I just couldnt stop reading it. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a fantastic book/story full of Gods truths and challanges to live out our daily christian lives in a way to Bless , encourage and lead others to Christ."
1,The Best of Ozzie & Harriet,"I love Ozzie and Harriet and I wish I knew what this was. If anyone has information on this, can you post it."
1,"re-release of 1st half of previous ""best of""","I received my copy today and will be returning it tomorrow unopened: it's just a re-release of the first disc of the previous 2-disc ""best of"", same episodes and extras."
4,A glimse in to Islam,"Having just spent 7 months in the Middle East, and planning on returning soon, I have been trying to become familiar with the beliefs and customs of the Arab people. Teach yourself Islam is an excellent resource to scratching the surface of the beliefs and customs in this part of the world. It is written in straight forward language and is organized well, so as to make looking up one particular topic easy."
5,Good book for all people........,This is a wonderful book for those looking to learn about Islam and for all Muslims who already know about Islam. It gives basic info on the religion but also helps clarify that middle eastern cultures are not good representations of the religion. This book is a great buy and definitely worth one's hard earned cash.
4,great for lining up those drawer fronts,"These easy to use drawer front adjuster are great. Ever try to get that drawer front lined up perfectly square? Nearly impossible, it always moves! These allow you to tweak the drawer front up and down or sideways. Then, you simply tighten the screw and viola, your done. Very simple to use.However, you need a 20mm forstner bit to sink these in AND you need the marker dowel that is sold for these to know where to drill into your drawer box. Don't overtighten or you will strip them out."
1,Don't bother...,"I purchased a bunch of these for some drawers. The adjusters did not come with instructions and little info was available on the Blum web site.After using these, I found it faster, easier and less expensive to use two-sided carpet tape to temporarily attach the drawer fronts and adjust them. Then I used wood screws to attach them permamently to the boxes. In addition, these devices would not draw the front tightly to the front of the drawer box. I had to use wood screws anyway.Don't waste your time or money."
2,Extremely attentive to details,"there were fourteen pages describing the journey to the old house in the first story alone! It was not scary in any true definition of the world of horror. If you want to waste time or need something to help you to sleep buy it, priced just right for insomniacs.. free"
5,The Relic,"The Relic is one of my family's favorite ""scary"" movies. We had it on VHS but our last VCR broke during a move. I searched high and low and could not find The Relic on DVD anywhere. Thank you for getting it to us so quickly. It is a family hit (we have not even watched Pet Sematary 2 yet)."
2,pretty bad,"Bought it only because we had PS #1. Some good moments,but pretty dumb. Why do you dumbbells keep taking these dead things to the cemetary with always negative creepy results????? Relic monster took too long to show himself-pretty good monster though. When you finally see glimpses of him."
1,This book is bad on many levels,First it is obvious why it is out of print--it hasn't been updated since 1983. I bought it at amazon (used) and really regret it. I am reseaching punk music and wanted a good view of the LA and SF scenes. This book has way too many pictures (a few great pictures--most are dull) and the text is written in a journalistic style that seems too close to the subject. Hardcore includes the quality bands on the scene but also focus on bands that have no influence on music and even fans of punk music has never heard of. Don't be tempted to get this--I am saving you from this hell!
4,Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics,"book combines concepts of Epidemiology and biostatistics. It makes easy to understand how epidemiology is interlinked with biostatistics because in a clinical trial both are needed. I like this book because the language is easy to interpret. It is very useful for those who have difficulty in understanding the concepts of biostatistics. The best part of the book is that the text is explained in reference to clinical research, which makes life easier for medical students and doctors. A lot of examples are given within the text to make the text easy to understand. After each chapter a comprehensive test is given.To cut the long story short, This book is one of the best for those who have difficulty in understanding Biostatistics."
3,"Worth seeing, but more for the subject than the content","It's refreshing to see a documentary about the Soviet space program! Yet it turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment. It has a substantial array of interviews with surviving cosmonauts, plus others who were involved in the program. But the documentary has almost no narration; it seems to be trying to rely on the interviews to do the narration for it, which often didn't work. My wife said she would have been lost if I hadn't kept filling her in on the details as we went along. The DVD has a bonus film, Starman, about the life and career of Yuri Gagarin. If you watch The Red Stuff and are disappointed, don`t skip Starman thinking it`ll be more of the same. It`s well-narrated and well-explained, and well worth watching. Starman was really what The Red Stuff should have been."
4,Could It Be Magic (6:17) on CD!,"This is a special 2-track CD from the Unidisc 12"" Classics series, in this case featuring two 12-inch versions of disco classics by Donna Summer. This version of Bad Girls has a running time of 4:57. What is especially noteworthy for hardcore fans is the long version of Could It Be Magic, which clocks in at 6:17, much longer than the 7-inch (3:55) and album (5:15) versions that are the only other versions available on CD.The only thing that prevents this from being a five-star review is the quality of the transfer, which was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, this exclusive version of Could It Be Magic makes this a collector's item."
2,"As a big fan of Berenstain Bears, I am a little disappointed in this book","1) few kids go to spend all their money as fast as their legs could carry them. I don't like to read this part, because I don't want to put the wrong idea into my kid's head.2) It didn't really explain about the ""rainy day"".3) my 4 year old asked me why the brother and sister bears can talk to strangers just to make some money!all in all, as a big fan of Berenstain Bears, I am a little disappointed in this book."
2,VERY BORING INDEED!,"Having seen this game at E3 2004, I must say I'm very disappointed in the look and play.The game is nothing new and is really bland. The graphics are dated and look rather dull. I would not recommend this game to anyone who had bought the last one.Look out for Jak 3 or Ratchet & Clank 3, they are much better games and look a hundred times better. I played all three games and this was the boring one!Is this for real? This game looks pants. I was hoping it would be better then the last one, but in fact it's worse. The game has cut-scene after cut-scene and no real fun factor."
5,boo yoah,funny funny funny FUNNY! as i said this is the funiest game i have ever played i completed in a month and i loved it i codnt stop laughing i think the two funiest parts is when you get chased by a cheif who wants to put you in his porige and the other one is when cotecs brain gets poled out annd chuked bake at him and then goes running of like a idote i would say to rent firstthen buy
1,A disappointed Crash fan :(,"My kids and I have been huge fans of Crash, especially the second, the third and CTR.Twinsanity is no fun at all and was a huge let-down. It's not anything like the others and practically requires you to learn the controls all over again. The music is so annoying you'll want to turn it off and the constantly changing camera angles can leave you a bit motion sick.If you really think you want this one, do yourself a favor by renting it first, you'll be glad you did."
2,Not what I expected..,"I personally love Crash Bandicoot games, been a fan since I was young but this game (the disk) wasn't good. The game itself was fun until it stopped working. My saved game kept erasing and freezing to the point where I no longer even considered playing it. As soon as I got it, I noticed the glitches and the mini freezes..Its a good game but the disk tends to get messed up quick. Used or new this game won't last long. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it is for a very good price."
4,love crash!! but...,This game was so fun in the beginning now its so hard even my boyfriend who has been a gamer all is life cant beat this one part! lolI love he game play the comedy everything i just wish it was easier! :)
3,kind of sucked,in this game crash falls easily over bridges and cliffs and you generaly have to go back to a cutscene which you cant skip .It was hard for me and worse for a kid.It was challenging and stressful not a lot of fun
2,RIDICULOUSLY Frustrating,"Man. I thought this would be interesting, Crash and Cortex both playable characters. I've been into Crash since Crash 2 came out when we got our PS1. Why is it wrong to continue having games like the first three? (Because it's not Naughty Dog, thanks kids.) I mean, it can't be THAT difficult to find new scenarios that don't involve some crazy shift in gameplay where your players don't even want to deal with it anymore.This game was so frustrating I couldn't beat the first level. At one point, I had 10 lives and lost them all in one single area. The controls are difficult to maneuver since while fighting, Crash and Cortex go so fast that every 10 seconds you just hit a load of Nitro (which Aku Aku does not help with...)All in all, this game was worth the 3 dollars I spent for it. Fun for about an hour until it got so frustrating I nearly pulled my hair out. I figure at 21 I should be able to beat the first level of a kid's game....apparently not."
4,Soooooooooooooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game has great graphics,characters, and fun. In the game you play as a new person nina cortex and if all those peaple who said it was bad didn't like nina they're odd. This game to me was more fun than the first crash on the playstation2. If you liked the first one I know you'll love this one. The only bad part is you can't go back to the levels you like. Besides that it is realy fun."
4,The Best Soccer Team,"Its a good documentary, but i did not gave it five stars because the last cup disputed is not recorded and i felt the dvd has some ""gaps"" in it. Never the less it is a great dvd to watch and learn some stuff about the best mexican team in history!!!If you are a fan this is a Must Have, and if you are no fan of sports, or soccer this is a good oportunity to see why some of us go crazy every time we see a game, you can say that you will feel and get to see ""what lies under this club"" and what makes passion come around."
2,Ho-Hum,"I love the topic. I stuck with the book because I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't happen.Nancy Pearl is a good writer but the plot is pretty boring. In order for me to like a book, there has to beat least one character that I like and relate to. Not here. They were all integrity-challenged. Not one strongcharacter in the bunch. I read the book because it got glowing reviews. Not this time."
1,After Life,"Sorry to say, I thought the book was lame. It was slow moving and the storyline weak. Boring, boring, boring. Ellis gave about as much insight and depth to the characters and storyline as my comments are in this review. The book doesn't deserve any more said."
3,Slow,Not what i expected took awhile to realize that there wasnt much more to the story. Was not very suspenseful.
2,So Slow,"I have been reading this book for nearly a month now. I cannot get into it. It started off strong and I was really excited and then it went blah all of a sudden. Then something happened and I thought ok now we take off..but we drifted off to another subject. Then once again another false start. I'm sitting here getting my heart pumped up for the story to really get going and for me, it never does. I thought I would enjoy it, I love stories about mediums, physics, spirits, ghost and New Orleans (although they moved from there) You would think by her being from the NOLA, (Naomi that is) Her story would've been fun, exciting and convincing. I have made this a bathroom book, You are only in there for a few minutes and that's all I can take of this book, Maybe in a few more months I will be done with it. As of now I don't know what book everyone else read..couldn't have been this one."
3,close but no cigar,"I enjoyed Ellis's voice a great deal, found her characterization authentic and her scenery richly rendered. She does a fantastic job creating tension and keeping it at a high level, with just enough breathing room to allow the reader some rest.My disappointment, however, came with the ending, which I found almost ridiculously weak. To learn, at the end, that Morton was just a boring jerk and that Naomi killed him in a rather dull domestic argument totally deflated any meaning the author was building towards. Not to mention that I found it highly unlikley that he would actually die from an object being lobbed across the room.Overall, I'm under the impression that Ellis is a damn good writer who simply didn't know how to end this novel - a common mistake for first time novelists - and so she came up with an ending that fails to live up to the promise of the story."
2,Good writing - Bad Editing,"This was a book club selection and it was rather disappointing. I believe it is out of print and that is probably okay. The author is a very good writer, her descriptions are beautiful and her ability to ""paint the picture"" are amazing. However, the story line is incredible unrealistic and I found myself not being able to enjoy it because of the unbelievableness of the plot. It would be one thing if it was a fantasy or sci-fi novel, but I think you are actually suposed to believe the crimes being committed would never get noticed...Good writing, terrilbe editing."
1,"Starts strong, goes nowhere fast","I was quite disappointed in this book. It had a great premise, and a strong start, but the author never went anywhere with it. Lots of mundane details, and unlikable main character and just a generally miserable read. I'm actually sorry I read it."
4,Destination: Train Line,"For me, it wasn't so much about the mystery, or the interweaving of Spiritualism, or the fact that Naomi worked in the town's library. (As a librarian, I'm drawn to books with them as main characters.) I loved the town, and the characters within!Ellis' sense of place is wonderful. I mean, I *was there*. The Lake, the Ha-Ha, the descriptions of the old-timers (both houses and people) made me actually want to visit this place.At first, I too was a little disappointed in the revelations surrounding the murder. But, then I thought--""This has been a great ride."" And, after all, getting there was half the fun!"
3,What Naomi Did,"This starts with a murder, then describes the years of guilt which follow for Naomi Ash.Naomi's Trance Medium mother takes them out of New Orleans quickly, when her use of theatre to enhance the seance experience for her clients becomes too much of a liability.They make their home in Train Line, NY (based on Lily Dale, NY) a very small community of old time Mediums and New Age Psychics. This is where Naomi spends her formative years in the small town, populated with widely differing and gifted, colourful characters.The plot is extremely slow (although the ending is rushed) and salvaged only by the interactions of the vivid characters without whom, truthfully, I'd have stopped reading.It's a book that explores inner fears, consequences, emotions and how they can be changed over time by ones memory of events. Lies that become truths, with each retelling of events and the motivations behind them.I don't think it lived up to the glowing introduction by Nancy Pearl, at least not for me."
2,Slow like a deep river,"I am never sure what to say about a book I have read that I don't particularly care for. Someone else might love it and I feel that anyone willing to put their time in and create a work of fiction has a gold star in my book. This book is nicely written but it is slow paced and makes it hard for me to want to continue reading it. I don't find any of the characters particularly deep or interesting. Being the daughter to a medium sounds quite fun or exciting but with ""After Life"" I found neither. There isn't really any high's or low's except for wondering how Peter died and it seems to take forever to find out. At the end of the book, I was still wondering exactly why it was ""brought back to life"" by Book Lust Rediscoveries. I see no reason fro the reader not to try it, but forewarned is forearmed. Reading a slow paced , gentle book might be right up you alley so to speak. If so, this is a good book for you."
4,Wonderful Mix of Psychology & Spiritualism,"Ellis in her first book showed her talents. Description of the place of incidences is breathtaking. I was impressed by the character of Naomi who is holding the terrifying truth in her mind regarding the Body. A good suspense specially its' a narrator based novel. The novel describes nicely the complex aspects of life - Eternity, Spiritualism, Psychology. Worth reading Book !"
1,A total waste of time,"This assessment was unanimous within my book club. We decided there was a reason this book is out of print, and it should stay that way. We kept waiting for something to happen. Not only were the characters flat, but the whole story really lead nowhere and was unsatisfying."
4,"Not a ""Whodunit""","This book is difficult to categorize. It isn't a ""whodunit,"" because we know who killed Peter Morton from the first page. It is a mystery in a sense, as we want to know why he was killed and how. However, it is also about spiritualists. The main character Naomi Ash and her mother were mediums who lived in a town that was mainly inhabited by spiritualists. Above all perhaps it is a book about Naomi and her relationships with Peter, her mother, the girl she babysat and several others.Naomi often seemed lonely, plagued by guilt and lacking in self-confidence especially after Peter's body is found 10 years following his death. I found myself wondering if she would be caught and could she ever be happy even if no one learned what she had done. How would the book end?I thought this book was quite well written. The descriptions of Naomi, her thoughts and feelings and her surroundings were excellent. Readers who like lots of action may not enjoy the book as much as I did."
3,3.5 Actually. Very Interesting but lacks something...,"Right from the start, After Life holds the promise of a mystery but quickly becomes a character study of a lonely, confused, and unstable young woman. I did enjoy the book and found it to be quite interesting. It's a story of a young woman, Naomi Ash who killed her boyfriend Peter. Page one starts out telling us how she gets rid of the body but doesn't tell how or why until about half way through the book. After I finished reading this, I wasn't sure what I thought about it. I did enjoy it and read it through, but something was off."
5,Hypnotic,"I love this book and I love how it came to me. It makes me very happy that there are people with the sheer know with all to discover a book like this. I want to see this in film, 3D, IMax and any other form because of its storytelling genius."
4,Fascinating prose,"Rihan Ellis certainly knows how to draw a character believably and create an atmosphere that is familiar to all of us--even when it's not all that familiar. Naomi Ash is raised by her mother in a world not many of us know, the world of spiritualism, and by the age of 10 knows most of the parlor tricks involved in""speaking with the dead."".The atmosphere is ripe for crime and one takes place. While the motive wasn't all that interesting, the rainy ambiance of the novel suggests to me a promising new talent. Recommended for fans of out of the way mystery fans."
3,Could be better,"After Life starts with narrator Naomi Nash describing the event immediately following her murder of her own boyfriend some years ago. The book then goes back and forth between the present, Naomi's childhood, and the time just before she committed murder.Growing up around psychics and mediums and becoming a practicing medium herself means that Naomi's life has always been intimately connected with death, but when the body of the man she killed is discovered, Naomi finds she isn't as comfortable with her world as she once was.This isn't a mystery, so much as a character study or a lonely, confused, unstable young woman. It's a quick and interesting book to read, but I was left with more questions than answers, and I found the ending less than satisfying."
3,After Life,Just could not get into this book for some reason. I am an avid reader but this one was not for me.
2,buggy and slow,"I bought this along with a new Olympus camera, for all the obvious reasons (faster downloading). I'm not that enamoured with it.The good:- downloading is definitely faster than from the camera- it's portable, so I can use it on any of my PC's or laptops- I didn't have too many issues making it workThe bad- bad driver; still not XP certified. I'd expect Olympus to have their act together in this regard- wouldn't work with my 7-in-1 floppy drive card reader; I've had to disable that on my PC to get this to work- doesn't like 'moving' pictures - will only 'copy' and then I have to manually delete the pictures through file manager or the camera- I think it is slow: plugged into a USB 2.0 and transfer rates are well below par. It takes about 15-20 seconds to download a single SHQ.JPG picture (about 3.5MB)I personally would opt for something else (e.g. a multi reader with XP certified drivers) before getting this card reader.Happy shoppingJB"
4,Combo XD and Smart Media Reader,"This reader works great..after getting the driver to load on my XP Pro system. Initially, the reader was on a Windows 98 machine and was the perfect solution to read both medias. Each slot appears as its own drive on windows explorer.The reader is simple to use and has a light letting you know if the drive is working. The information is moved quickly to the computer."
2,Olympus and XP don't mix!!,"I bought this reader for my Olympus D-460 Zoom because Olympus won't update a driver for XP. (Maybe we should update cameras when we update pc's?)Back to this card reader, None of the software is XP certified, meaning it won't install! Tried downloading the updated software from the Oly website, same problem!! The only thing I got after 5 attempts was it loaded a driver and the XP software reads your card and directs it to a destination. [...]"
1,Not fully compatable with Windows XP,"I was unable to get this reader to work at all with my Windows XP system. Both the drivers on the disc and the ""latest"" drivers on the Olympus site are outdated and not signed by Microsoft.I tried using the device with both USB 1 and USB 2 ports with the same results. After a bit of a fight, the drivers do seem to install and you get a drive icon for each memory slot, but it doesn't recognize any media inserted, (you don't even get a flicker of the drive access light).In reading the other reviews it seems that some people are able to get it to work on XP, but it's a crap shoot.Without updated, signed drivers, I can't recommend this device."
1,"Works, But VERY Slow","I purchased this reader as a more convenient option than having to get out the camera (C-5060 Wide Zoom), and also to save battery power. Unlike the problem other reviewers had, the software installed just fine on my Windows XP.The reader works and it accomplishes the task of saving battery power. However, the download is FAR slower than with the camera itself. It is so much slower, that I prefer to waste battery power and just use the camera. It's just too darn slow to merit even two stars."
1,A dud,"Followed all directions,when I tried to download pictures, the indicator light didn't flash or stay lit at all. I got an error message saying something about the logo not being proper and that I should return to merchant to have it made right. Needed to use it right away. so I borrowed a friend's webcam and took pictures for my auctions with it. I was very disgusted, so I never wrote you and just took the loss. I haven't used you since.G"
1,A Real Pain for Vista Users,"At first blush the reader's software loaded easily as did the plug-in USB cord. The computer synced with it, no problem. The fun began when I inserted my photo card. Fonts that I've never seen before popped on on an old ""DOS"" format telling me to log off immediately before a system crash. After removing and reinstalling the software, it happened again. I called Olympus tech support only to be told by a tech that his ""mentor"" would have to solve the problem and that I'd be called back within 48 hours. It didn't happen. I finally got hold of someone at tech support who knew what they were talking about, and we downloaded a patch that needed to be run TWICE before it would take effect. It is finally working, but if I had to to do it all over again, I wouldn't."
1,30 Dollar Piece of JUNK,"Buyers beware - this product does not work with Mac PowerPC processors. The device made my computer crash 5 or 6 times without downloading a SINGLE photo. I called Customer Support, and after waiting about 30-45 minutes, the representative told me that this product does not work with OSX on powerbooks.This is baffling since the box clearly states it works with versions of OSX 10.1.2 or higher. I dont know if this should be considered false advertisement or what, but I am considering contacting the Better Business Bureau if I do not get a full refund on this pricey piece of trash.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU ARE BETTER OFF JUST WITH THE CABLE THAT CAME WITH THE CAMERA."
1,POOR SUPPORT FROM OLYM PUS.,I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FROM THE RECOMMENDATION OF OLYMPUS TECH SUPPORT. HOWEVER AFTER RECEIVING THE PRODUCT I AM NOW TOLD BY THEM THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS VISTA. I HAD TO BUY A NEW CAMERA TO DOWN LOAD PHOTOS INTO MY COMPUTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE USING VISTA S.W.
2,"Does what i wanted, nothing more","The sole reason I bought the reader was for the xD reader. and that works perfectly. however, i tried to use it with my SD card, like it claims it can do, and I actually broke it in half (the card) trying to put it in the reader. I really did not pay much for it, so being it serves it's purpose. And I was able to still use the SD card after it broke, so I still can't complain too much. But if you are buying it for it's ""all-in-one"" capabilities, don't."
3,Olympus 10 XD Picture Card Reader,"I have been unable to get this product to work with Windows VISTA or XP. I tried to get drivers to support the product and therefore make it operational but so far no luck in finding drivers.Therefore, I do not recommend this product until they have workable drivers for Windows XP and Vista."
5,"Easy to Install, Worked Great",The card reader was very easy to install and worked like a charm. It is actually easier than using the software and connection cords that came with the Olympus camera.
2,2000 Dyno runs? Am I missing 1200 pages?,"While I think this book has some good information, I think anyone who regularly reads Muscle Mustang and Fast Fords will have read most of this already. It states there are 2000 dyno runs, I counted, and came up with around 180. While this is a lot, most of this was already in MM & FF magazine. They didn't even test a vortech/paxton centrifugal supercharger on a stock engine. They did this test for a Kenne Bell, but it would be a great comparison to test the KB against a centrifugal supercharger. Overall, I am dissapointed, I think most of this is regurgitated material."
4,stains easily,"I used the spatula to cook Maggi, and now the yellow colours is boiled in. Pasta sauce does not seem to stain it however. This is a minor gripe, I like the light weight, and they are no harder to clean than my previous nylon utensils. There are no smells either, and I assume these are safer than ingesting any nylon that might boil off?"
3,"Good price, poor quality","I think this product is absolutely adorable, and I love the bamboo canister...but these really are very low quality. They arrived very rough with plenty of splinters. After two uses I had to break off a pretty big splinter from one of the spoons. For the price? Great deal, use them til they break, then get something better. In the future I'll probably buy the spoons separately and just reuse the canister, unless it breaks soon as other reviewers have mentioned."
4,So Useful I Bought Two Sets,"After two plus decades, I finally decided to replace my wood utensils. Though they had served me well, they were now cracked and splintering.I was considering nylon or silicone utensils to replace them, but about the same time, I had purchased a bamboo cutting board and really loved it. So I checked out bamboo utensils and found these very nice and reasonably priced tools.First, they are great with all types of cookware, whether traditional or nonstick. And the burnished bamboo surface is very tough. It doesn't mind high heat or the dishwasher.I also like the bamboo container. It's small enough to place anywhere in the kitchen. I have on set by the stove and another on my prep table.The only thing I wish it had was a deeper spoon or ladle for serving."
5,"A great buy, and looks great","I have always use used cheap wooden spoons. I have tossed too many to remember.But this set! WOW polished utensils in it's own container. It fits on the counter nicely. I usually put my kitchens tools away. But this one I can show off. I won't be tossing these. They're too pretty to throw away. I have to say already own the 3 piece set which lead me to buy the whole Utensil set. A great buy. A lovely gift.Joyce Chen Stirfry Set, 3 Piece"
2,The holder split after 6 months,"I purchased this set in August, 2009 and absolutely loved it. It looked great on my kitchen counter until this morning (six months from purchase date) when I walked to the kitchen in the morning and found the holder split opened from the bottom all the way up to the top. The utensils have held up well, though; therefore, I give this product some credit, but I am disappointed that the holder didn't last for too long."
5,love it,"my wife love these so much shes telling everyone about them, they are sturdy looking for some more stuff like these"
4,The Most Wonderful Product I Have Ever Brought Into My Home,"Bamboo has changed my life. Chronic back pain vanished. My vision miraculously improved to 20/20 caliber. My social life has improved dramatically. A distant relative I never knew I had left me a huge chunk of money. I attribute all of this good fortune to my purchase of the bamboo kitchen utensils. They are well-made, they arrived as ordered, and they will ROCK YOUR WORLD. Capiche?"
5,Quality Craftsmanship,Very nice quality for the price! The utensils look attractive in their holder and do not take up much space on the counter. Highly recommended.
2,Over priced,Not worth the price. Found a set very similar at Ross for about 3 dollars. Wish I had shopped around a little more.
2,Meh.,"I bought these last week, and out of the box the holder was split across the bottom. I probably should have returned it, but that's more effort than I care to exert - I bought it for the spoons, not the holder.That being said, the spoons are not anything to write home about. Save your money and buy the 10 piece set Amazon sells - much better quality, and you just get more... I think it's cheaper, too."
5,Great Style and Structure,Very durable bamboo material. The stylish container is a nice addition to our kitchen set.
1,"Varnished, not Burnished","The pieces are varnished, not burnished. I wanted unvarnished cooking utensils, to prevent chemicals being released into food over time. One item has drips in the varnish, and some sort of fiber stuck dried into it as well. I replaced these with rough unvarnished bamboo utensils for about $1 at a random store from our local Chinatown."
2,A lot odd pieces,"I don't like about the product was the shape of the utensils. I have to get used to the shape and I didn't notice until after I purchased them that it doesn't come with a fork utensil. A lot odd pieces, but Very cheap quality. If I knew I wouldn't buy."
3,"Not the best, but for the price it's worth it.","I bought this through Amazon, and after I received it, I saw what poor quality the utensils were. They were thin and definitely made of cheap bamboo. I knew they weren't going to hold up, so I tried to return it to Amazon. They refunded me my money and told me to keep them (probably because shipping would be too much for them to be worth it). I kept them and used them a very few times over the past year (mostly the spoon when my other ones are in the wash. They've held up okay, but I use them rarely because I'm in constant fear that they're going to break at the slightest bit of use. I don't really recommend this set if you plan on using them often."
4,"Good, but the spatula splintered.","I've had this set for a while, and it's good overall, but the spatula is splintering at the sides. Everything else is still like new, though, so maybe I just got a bad spatula.The tongs do take some getting used to, and should only be used for thinner/lighter foods. Thin chicken breasts, quesadillas, you get the idea. I get a lot of use out of the tongs in my kitchen, since those are usually the kinds of foods I'm cooking.The spoon is good, but I'm disappointed with how shallow it is. It's not so much a bamboo spoon, as a bamboo stick with a slight indentation at the end. It is my longest spoon, so I need it to stir food as it cooks, but I always have to use one of the shorter spoons when it's time to serve, which gets pretty inconvenient for someone whose only dishwasher is my hand with a sponge in it.All minor gripes aside, I do like this set, and I do use it every day."
2,Just ok,When I received my order the Utensil Holder was split from bottom to top. I was also not extremely happy with the bamboo utensils. I have other bamboo spoons and find the quality of these not very good.
3,ok...,I had to return this item because I would it was well coated and smooth. I wanted to get a wooden spoon set but I don't like the feeling of wood. I have seen at stores wooden spoons that are heavy coated and feel different but this was not it.
1,poor quality,Don't buy this product. The product is not packaged well. One of the spoons was damaged when I opened the package. I bought it mostly for show. The damage wrecked that idea. The whole set is now sitting in a box in the garage waiting for the next trash pick up.
2,Utensil holder cracked...,In just over 2 months the round holder cracked in 2 places...one opposite from the other. And out of return window...of course. Not very happy with this...do not recommend brand.
4,Bamboo is better...,"Gave this to a friend for Christmas and she loves it. This is a nice set for the money and very attractive. We like using bamboo in the kitchen,it doesn't scratch your cookware and is easy to clean."
5,Great Set,A great set gave along with the Joyce Chen wok for a Christmas gift to a friend of mine. She was very happy with the present - I would recommend to anyone.
4,"great value, easy to clean","I needed a new wooden spoon / spatula set and liked the idea of putting them in the dishwasher. The burnishing also helps ease handwashing too, as the surface is smoother. I knocked a star off for quality control reasons. The spatula I received had a funny gouge in the back (though Amazon responded well to compensate and I can order a replacement). Also, the black rope decoration on the base is sloppy, but I didn't need that component anyway. Overall, I can't complain, given the price."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read.,"This book rocks, I am a avid reader of the Forgotten Realms books, that is all I read. This book was a good book to be a sequel of the Avatar Trilogy. The god of intrigue, Mask, was a tool in this book. Especialy, when it is he who is Godsbane, protecting the lost soul of Kelemvor Lyonsbane. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes intrigue, deception and dispair."
4,Entertaining....,"Most authors focus on either the ""talk"" or the ""action"" when they write. What made this book work for me was the equal attention given to both and the seamless interaction of the two. The characters really come to life in your head, and you know what? The gods are weird,singleminded wackos!!! Hmmm. Sounds like an Oliver Stone flick...."
5,Good god save us all!!!!,A good book for those who like to read about god and gods' actions and those that affect mortals!
1,"big events, weak logic...avoid if you like your story to make sense at all.","I like my book to make sense, that the logic behind an action and the capability of the person to carry that action is credible.That's why I love Salvatore's Drizzt stories.Here in this book, you will find the struggle between gods/goddesses. Big event to happens in the Forgotten Realms. Sadly it's delivered in such a weak manner.You'll find that sometimes the god/goddesses can be soooo powerful that they can literally rid off another god with a shrug and yet other time to find them so pathetically weak that they can't even destroy an item made by human and imbued using magic (with minimum sacrifice I should add).If your entertainment is reading a book with random event weave together without much thought on the logic behind it, then this is your book.If you like your story to make sense, then avoid this book at all cost. Stick to Drizzt's books."
4,620 PAGES???,"WHO IS THE ONE COUNTING??? PLEASE 620 PAGES??? NEXT TIME COUNT THE PAGES WITH ACTUAL CONTENT,NOT ALL THE FILLER SO PEOPLE DONT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE GETTING A LOT; WHEN IN REALITY IS ALMOST 200 PAGES SHORT."
1,Dissappointing,"It's only 30 minutes long with no performances, just background music, barely audible. It's nice to hear about the Sun years, but I expected to see some perfomance and at least hear some songs and didn't know I was only getting 30 minutes of material."
4,Fun idea,"This was a fun idea that I did for my friend. Rules are that I can't give any details, but I hope that someone does this for me."
4,"Horace Silver's ""Pieces of Silver|",For years I had searched for one title on this disk without success. I would rate it 3* just on the basis of that title
5,beautiful deck,"The artwork in this deck truly amazes me. Some of the ways in which the author has chosen to depict the meaning of the cards really brings a new sense of what a card means. The three of swords comes to mind, which features a woman curled on a bed with her face buried in her arms, and a man staring coldly out a window. It truly shows the nature of heartbreak. The book is helpful, it gives insights as to how Egyptian life corralates to the meanings of the cards. Those that work with the Thoth deck would like this one. It seems to be influened by Thoth in some of the imagery and the keywords used to describe the minor arcana. It is truly one of the more beautiful and human of the Egyptian decks out there."
4,A beautiful deck for Tarot and Egyptian enthusiasts,"Not only is each and every card in this Deck a work of art, Clive Barrett seamlessly blends Ancient Egyptian symbolism and religion with the many meanings of Tarot. The accompanying book gives wonderful explications of the meanings of the illustrations on the cards, but does not explain their deeper meaning as well as some of the in-depth Tarot books I've read. If you have any affinity for the culture of Ancient Egypt, this is the perfect deck for you. The book is a good place to begin learning about Tarot -- but I suggest eventually getting something like Tarot for Yourself to further explore what each card means to you."
4,A networking guide from three experts,"The essayist E. B. White said, ""No one should come to New York to live unless he is willing to be lucky."" People succeed when they make their own luck. Many do so through networking. If you are willing to be lucky, new opportunities may unfold before you because of a valuable connection you made yesterday, or one that you will make today or tomorrow. Authors Darcy Rezac, Judy Thomson and Gayle Hallgren-Rezac believe that ""positive"" networking is the key that opens the door to all of life's possibilities. If you want to learn to build valuable connections to get ahead, getAbstract recommends this easy-to-read and lighthearted, yet sensible and savvy, book."
1,Very superficial book,"I bought this book because of numerous ecstatic reviews. I regretted my decision just after I finished the first page. The book may be useful for uncommunicative persons born in Siberia or Amazonia, but for an average person living in a city this book is complete literary trash. In addition, and what I really hate in the book, is author's permanent self advertising."
2,Save your $$$ and buy more business cards,"This was recommended to me during an webinar on job hunting.Let me save you 16 bucks. Get business cards. Give them out to everyone, ask for them in return and make a database. Follow-up with emails or letters. Go everywhere and look for people who look like they will talk to you or are wallflowers and get them involved. Don't just ask ""what can you do for me?"" Go to every networking-type event you can.That's it, really. OK, he goes a bit more in-depth, but honestly, this could have been a long article in Business Week. Take out the 5th through 23rd mentions of how you should exchange business cards and that would probably cut it down enough. Seriously, I think he must own stock in a printing company."
5,Take the Leap!,"Here's your safety net for taking the leap into networking. ""Work the Pond"" is a must have tool for building successful relationships. The power of networking will enrich your life, personally and professionally beyond your imagination.Darcy takes his message of ""What can I do for you?"" by sharing his knowledge and expertise on positive networking. He even tells you exactly where to find opportunity!Valuable ""Nuggets"" of helpful tips are sprinkled throughout the pages that give you a book inside a book. One of my favorites: It's not the mistake that matters; it the recovery.Thanks to Darcy, Judy and Gayle, these tips and techniques will surly expedite the process of my vision to touch and enrich a million lives. Know that you make a difference! I count you as one of my ""Lucky Stars""."
3,It appears to have helped raise my good cholesterol.,I started taking this on the advice of my endocrinologist. She told me it's a good supplement to help raise HDL levels. I was on this and Tricor for Triglycerides/Cholesterol. After 3 months or so my Triglycerides were drastically reduced (due to the Tricor) and my choloesterol was in the normal range for both HDL and LDL (thanks to the combination). I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 due to the fact I can't prove 100% how much of the change is the Tricor and how much the Policosonal. But since things are vastly improved I'm not going to stop taking it just to see.
1,Not effective for me,"I was concerned that my cholesterol was 200 with HDL 55, so I took 20 mg/day of Vitamin Shoppe policosanol for 3 months. I had my cholesterol re-tested and it was exactly unchanged at 200 with HDL 55. So I am going to try another brand. Note: Consumerlab.com reports that most of the brands of non-precription cholesterol-lowering pills they tested, including policosanol, contained significantly less than the amounts specified, sometimes much much less (like 4%)."
4,More good Flanagan,"This is a very enjoyable trio session from 1978. Flanagan displays his mastry as always, and the tune selections includes compositions by Monk, Horace Silver, and Wes Montgomery. One interesting inclusion is the use of electric piano, which I hadn't heard him do before."
4,Oh So Close!,"If only this collection had included ""Crying Time"" & ""America the Beautiful"", I could have easily given it 5 stars. Otherwise, a great collection of The Genius's work."
5,love it!,"after watching the movie, RAY, I bought this cd and just love it. it made me smile.... and some songs made me dance!"
4,"A manifesto and a paradox, sort of.","This small, profusely illustrated book is, well, a personal manifesto against bad informational design. Mijksenaar does not take prisoners: his case studies (of bad design) include glitches by some of the most prominent dutch designers. Healthy, very healthy. There are some surprises, especially if your infodesign paradigm is the London underground map. The book is also a paradox, though, in that it is itself badly designed. By that I don't mean the shape, color, printing, which are pretty, but its logical content structure, which is confusing. Because it is more of a (needed) rant against bad info design, I call it a manifesto. It is an optimistic manifesto, and Visual Function is well worth reading, if only because US designers would profit from getting to know their their dutch counterparts better."
3,It's not really a book ...,"... it's more of a pamphlet. Mijksenaar provides some nice examples and interesting ideas, but I wanted much more. Once can read this ""book"" in less than an hour."
2,Where's the Beef?,"This appears to be a teaser for something else, maybe joining his faculty at the Delft University of Technology. The topic is interesting but few conclusions are drawn, many examples are given, but it's not clear what they are examples of. Techniques are alluded to but not describes. Disappointing, but otherwise a pretty little pamphlet."
3,you get what you pay for,The faucet was not easy to adjust.It works fine for what i paid for around $100.00 it is a good faucet
3,One of his better Anthologies,"I got this book several years ago while suffering from Ender's Game withdrawal. This book won't cure you from a desirefor high action and epic stories, but it will mess with your head. Once I picked it up and accepted the non-Enderness of thebook I enjoyed many of the short stories in this volume. I rate this book somewhere above Hart's Hope and below thesecond book in the Alvin series. Be sure you read all the information about the stories to get the most out of them."
1,what ever happened to 'insert and click install' ?,i can't actually review this game as i am but a common man and do not have a bachelors degree in programing. the instructions for loading it w/ inserting this in that file and that in this file etc etc etc is too much trouble to endure when i can just buy Black Ops and insert the disk and clik ...install.
4,Fast Read.....,"The seperate essays make this an easy book to put down and pick back up...but you prolly won't want to. If you are a new covert then this will have you goin' ""yeah....yeah...yeah"". If you ARE a new convert...hey? have u learned how to pray yet? If your not muslim this book gives you alotta info about how most moderate (as opposed to extremists) muslims feel about the state of Islam as it exists in the States. Peace be with ALL of you!"
2,ddt,Was not that great of a program. Sounded better then it is. I would not recomend this cd. Shipped on time.
4,Great book for on-the-spot answers,"If you, or many people in your organization, use ACT! day-to-day, for general contact management (but you're not trying to ""split the atom"" with it), than this book is a great, general purpose go-to book for quick, simple, straight-forward answers.Easy to use, well-written, nice screen caps. There is, however, very little information in here about more advanced items (such as using the ACT! developer API/SDK)."
3,A book on Act 2000,"I had been using Act 2000 for a long time, and this year I purchased Act 2005. If you are an Act 2000 fan, it is for you. But the many new options, interface (and bugs) of Act 2005 made this book outdated."
1,Don't Order if Your Buying New Software,Notice the copyright date before you get buy it. It is pretty much useless for anything except very basic item for Act 2009
1,Not a true Carter A68301 replacement,"Bought this as an alternative to the Carter A68301 fuel safety switch. First off the Carter has a 1/8"" threaded NPT fitting where this unit is 1/4"" (not mentioned in the product description) so if your oil pressure port is 1/8"" NPT like mine you will have to add some addition pipe fittings. The unit I received was defective or not a true substitute. The Sierra OP72533 has the same markings on the contacts as the Carter but the unit I received didn't have continuity between the P & S contact points. Not sure if this was an isolated case but the fact I had to add additional pipe fittings to make it work wasn't worth trying to exchange it for another unit. Without the P & S (normally closed) contact your fuel pump wont turn on until the boat is running. Not good when trying to start your boat with an empty carburetor bowl."
3,threads too big for GM application,"I ordered this part thinking i could fit it to the block with an adapter but could only find a 2"" steel extension or 1/2"" extension in brass. for marine i did not want to use brass to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. the steel extension tube available through the speed shops was too long to fit. so if you application is GM skip it and buy the carter A68301 if you want cut off at 2-4 pound or the Mr gasket if you want fuel shutoff at 15 pounds of oil pressure. both are 1/8 NPT and cost about $18 the MR Gasket unit is on amazon with prime and the Carter is cheaper by half off amazon. the part is a good part with almost exact specs to the Carter just the wrong threads for GM applications."
1,Don't bother--it will only irritate you,I find it hard to believe all the glowing reviews of this book and can only assume these reviews are written by friends of the author. I needed a good reference for this topic and followed the recommendations and I was extremely disappointed. This is a shallow book that does nothing for the true student of this topic. I believe that the author wants to become a celebrity more than help ordinary people he professes to help. I also wondered if this book is self-published and now can't help but wonder if the author could get a business publisher interested in this work. Does anyone out there know anything about Literary Press? I feel cheated and angry and will be sending the book back.
1,Not very impressed.,The book lacks credibility. I am not very convinced about the author's credentials in writing the book. I would not recommend it. There are better books out there on this subject.
1,All hat and no saddle,"I found this quite disappointing, especially after seeing the reviews of others. While there are lots of interesting and accurate facts sprinkled throughout this book, for the most part is as a self serving effort at trying to build a brand for the term Emotionally Charged Learning. The author uses gross generalizaions, over simplifies very complex issues and pulls supporting data and ""proofs"" out of context to justify his thesis."
3,It's ok.,"I read the previous reviews, and it seemed like a great buy. I bought it, but when I received the package, some of the corners were slightly chipped, although I didn't know what to expect from a shipped shelving unit. It requires of some strength to tighten the screws and it is slightly difficult if you are mounting it on your own. Overall, the product is more than ok, but I wouldn't say it's great. Also, if you have an IKEA close it might be worth the trip."
3,shelf,"it does its job, but it does not have the best fit and finish. it is actually two shelves that fit toegther."
3,Will help you in your two day trip to Germany,"This set consist of a small pocket phrase book that has useful sentences for airport transportation, lodging and dining. It is not for people who want to learn german for fluency.At least that is my impression. It will be very helpful for someone who needs to know several sentences for each place they go to such as hotel, restaurant and train station. Also, the CD has recordings on several of phrases from every two to three pages and it is not that easy to follow it. I studied German 4 years ago and got a certificate for Grundstufe2 so, it was not me but, the recording. Buy it for your few day Germany or a German speaking country trip. There are some other Berlitz products for serious German kanguage learners."
5,THIS BOOK TRULY ENHANCED MY LIFE.,"I have owned this book for about 6 years now and my enjoyment grows with every reading. Alexandra Stoddard beautifully relates thoughts on decorating one's home. The advice she gives however; has provided me with an unexpected bonus. I truly look at life differently now. I have experienced beautiful moments of grace that come during everyday tasks. Ms. Stoddard's writing has deeply touched me. I'm so much more excited about life. And she has inspired me to action in my decorating and I'm enjoying it immensely. I recommend this book because I've never read a decorating book with such heart before. In my opinion, Ms. Stoddard speaks from her heart and in turn has warmed mine. I hope others enjoy this lovely book as much as I have."
4,"Full of practical advice, but lacks ...","This book does contain some useful advice, on counter/desk/shelving heights, lighting placement and the like. However, there is no index, so none of it is easy to refer back to.Stoddard doesn't give many options to the reader. For example, she suggests painting your home exterior white with green shutters, like she did. As long as you want to create a replica of her home, you will like this book."
2,Same Old Stuff,"The problem with Alexandra's books is that once you've read one, you've read them all. I purchased Living a Beautiful Life and it has the same Grace Notes inside that others reference in her other books, like...Decant your mouthwash, Splurge on Flowers, etc. Did she actually forget she already gave us those hints years ago or what?"
3,Have a cup of tea and some lavender paint,"This is a ""flu"" book: you take it, a cup of tea, some glossy magazines, and a pretty pillow to bed when you feel sick, and the result is a soothing, if feverish, wander through home as a source of emotional fulfillment. It's especially good if you feel sick while rehabbing an old house, as most of the narrative concerns Stoddard's New England cottage rehab. Also, an elevated temperature will prevent you from noticing overlaps with her other books.The decorating advice is standard: have a plan, buy quality, don't be afraid of color, etc. The reasons to read this book are the grace notes, affection for Stoddard's writing style, or a liking for her decorating style, which runs to chintz and French Provincial."
2,Fair,"I have seen Ms. Stoddard quoted and referenced in so many other works that I finally decided to read her directly. I rather wish I hadn't; Ms. Stoddard's ideas seem more profound and applicable in small bites, supporting more concrete ideas than all together. Although I didn't disagree with her ideas, it was definitely a ""dreaming"" kind of book rather than a ""doing"" kind of book. A nice read, but not what I was expecting."
2,More flaws then raves,"I know, I know... if you picked the beep beep bedding this is a nice touch. Unfortunately there are a couple of 'buts.'1. The treads start coming out of the fabric before you take it out of the box. Not the best quality you can hope for.2. Take a peek at the mobile from underneath (the view that your baby will see the most). It looks like a bunch of stuffed rectangles- what's the fun in that? The matching cars & plains can only be seen by parents.If you buy this mobile it will serve as a primarily decorative piece (read: enjoyed more by you then the baby) if you're after function, look elsewhere."
1,what a waste of money,I bought this mobile because I also have the whole Beep Beep line. I agree that it does not play the music long enough to soothe your baby asleep. But my biggest gripe is my 5 month old son this morning pulled at the mobile and the train wheel came off. He could have easily choked on this. I realize that the company says to remove the mobile from the crib at 5 or 6 months so what is the point of having a mobile then. This is when my son really started to respond to it. I called Kidsline to tell them that their product could be dangerous and they were rude and condescending (basically told me it was my fault that I had the mobile on the crib still) I wish I would not have spent the [$$$] on this piece of junk.
4,doesn't play long enough,"My baby loves to stare at this and I do like it, but the music plays for such a short time. In all honesty, I barely use it because of this and usually just play a lullaby cd."
2,Terrible spout design,"Preservative free eye drops are hit and miss. I've had some success with Systane, not so much with other brands. Thera Tears may be marginally better than Systane, but the shape of its spout is terribly designed. It makes it extremely difficult to drop the tears into my eyes... sometimes it misses my eyes all together. When I try to aim closer with the vial, more than once I've touched my eyeballs... not a good thing. Also, my eye doctor said that vials can be reused for 24 hours if the top is put back on the vial, then covered with Saran Wrap and the vial is refrigerated. The Thera Tears drops tops make that impossible. It's great that Thera Tears has 2-4 more vials per package than other eye drops, but it doesn't do a whole lot of good when the spout design makes it beyond difficult to put the drops in one's eyes."
4,TheraTears,"Work splendid, love them . I usually use them in the am before I leave the house but also keep a few in my purse to rinse out the eye of allergens during the day."
1,Almost poked my eye out!!!!,"WHY is the tipped to this hooked???? Everything is wrong with this drop, WHY would the tip be hooked? I ALMOST poked my eye out, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE LET ALONE ANYONE WITH VERY BAD EYE SITE LIEK MYSELF. The tips hooked so you poke your eye out then all the drops run down your cheeks NON get into your eye, WHAT genius came up with this?You cannot reseal these to use later in the day like most preservative free drops you can. AND the tip CLOGS so you cant even use it a few minutes later even. If you try with pressure to unclog it it will shoot across your bathroom. What a mess these drop are, I can't belive something this bad is in production.WHY would you put SALT in your dry eyes? That would dry them even worst or cause your eyes to become dependant on these drops. I researched this and any salt solution is not good for your dry eyes.DO NOT BUY. I'm going back to systane."
5,As Good as I Expected,"Being a Chicago native, I have been spoiled by my ability to see Maestro Barenboim conduct the CSO on a fairly regular basis. In December, I was doubly spoiled when he conducted the Berlin Staatskappelle in a program of Beethoven's 3rd Symphony and 1st Piano Concerto, the latter from the piano. My impression at the time was that the conductor and his orchestra were very much in sync; an impression shared by my fellow concertgoers if you consider the lengthy ovation that followed the performance.This encouraged me to purchase this full set of nine symphonies, which I had in fact been eyeing for some time before that! I have not yet been disappointed. All of my favorites (3,5,6 and 9) exceeded my expecations, and I became more familiar with the others through repeated listenings. I highly recommend this set, and sincerely hope that at some point that the piano works will be released as well!"
1,Horrible product,It broke the second time I used it. The button that slides for the different light options broke on the inside. It never was drop or anything of that nature. This product was poor built. I will never buy anything from Dorcy again
2,Handle Broke Right Away,"I loved this awesome flashlight at first. The concept it great. However, The twisty handle broke for no reason not long after we purchased it. Total waste!"
3,"It's ok, but it needs an LED lamp",This works ok but it is hard on batteries and realy isn't that bright. We use it to hange in the center of the tent to get reasy in the evenings or early mornings. It works for that use because it rotates on the handle and will point down. I think I'd look for something else.
1,Low Quality,This is not even close to the quality of the original battery. Barely holds a charge after using it for several months.
2,Not holding charge very well,"I bought three of these for my little digital Elph and unfortuantely, they haven't worked out so well. The price point was nice, but I am having trouble getting them to hold their charge and not go dead within an hour of coming off the charger. Not very satisfied. They have done in a pinch, but haven't been very reliable."
3,Not bad,"A lot of stuff. The drawbacks are that it's sort of dry, few diagrams, short explanation, and that they just refer to some books, e.g. their book ""Secret of Pawn Endings"" or Nunn's ""Secrets of Rook Endings."""
4,tahiti bamboo roman shade,"Shade is pretty and well made, only complaint is, at night when lights are on (even a small lamp) the neighbors can see all the going on's in the home. Not enough privacy for me. Very easy to mount and hang."
2,Not very good if you are looking to freestyle,"This tape is not that good if you are looking to freestyle. However, if you want to learn older, out of date dance steps and line dances then this is the one for you."
1,Religous Crap,"Do NOT buy this book unless you're really into Jesus and Christianity. It's written ENTIRELY from that point of view. I swear every other line had something about praying, church, God and his plan for marriage. I thought I would be getting an objective, helpful book but instead I got some preachy piece of crap."
2,Better Books are Out There,"As a Christian about to get married I saw some good reviews for this book but found it wasn't nearly as helpful as others you can purchase. The chapters are short and there are questions to talk with your wife or fiance but there is no depth to the advice. Starts with some horror stories and uses a lot of analogies rather than getting to the important parts of the subjects of the chapters. I would highly, highly recommend these two instead:1. This Momentary Marriage: John Piper - If you are a Christian this is a great book to lay the spiritual foundation for your marriage.2. The Most Important Year of a Man/Woman's Life: A great nuts and bolts book that goes into much more depth than this 'Starting your marriage off right' does.Good luck!"
3,Find Out Who Your Friends Are,"If I only had this album to judge by I'd probably never buy any more Tracy Lawrence albums but I LOVED the song Find Out who Your Friends Are, the rest of the album leaves me cold.Rejane"
5,LOVE THIS CD!,"What a great CD. Love every song! When I first got it, I couldn't stop listening to it for months."
5,Find Out Who Your Friends Are,This is such a great song. I listen to it over and over. We love the whole CD.
5,Tracy is back!,I have to agree with the reviews here - Tracy has not disappointed his fans. The songs are great - the choice of material is great - even the cover is great. I was very happy to hear he was putting out a new album and the wait was worth it. Having Tim and Kenny singing with him is just icing on a truly great cake!!
5,Tracy's new cd,Tracy has out done himself on this CD. Most of the time there are a few songs I don't care for but I really love the whole CD. Find Out Who Your Friends Are is a great song. ( I like the version with Tracy singing by himself the best) My fav song is Your Why God Made Me. I preordered the CD and have already bought a few for family and friends. Everyone who enjoys true country music needs this one in their collection. Way to go Tracy....
5,Tracy Lawrence FOR THE LOVE,"Another awesome CD from a true Country Music artist. Tracy takes you on an emotional journey with this CD. It's one of his finest accomplishments. From the opening track ""Find Out Who Your Friends Are"" recalling how you realize who the true ones are when they are there for you even when your down on your luck, to the moving ""Easy As Our Blessings"" reminding us to be thankful for what God has blessed us with instead of what is troubling us. The title track ""For The Love"" featuring Brad Arnold from 3Doors down made me aware of the importance of things taken for granted, that are provided by people unselfishly giving of themselves. The inclusion of the road musicians on the album made it all the more special for a fan that frequents as many shows as possible!This project is touching in many ways to a true Tracy Lawrence fan because of the pure country aspect of the performance. The album encompasses all things country no matter what generation you are a member of."
1,1993 Dodge Stealth,"Amazon says that this thermostat (Stant 13868) will work on a 1993 Dodge Stealth ES. Either I received a deffective thermostat or this thermostat is not the correct one for a 1993 Stealth. I took my car to the dealer to have them install this thermostat and after they installed they said it is not the correct one & is causing the car to overheat. Do not get this product if you are looking to replace your thermostat on your Stealth. Also, I believe Dodge Stealths & Mitsubishi 3000GTs years 1992-1999 use the same thermostat so don't get this thermostat if you have any one of those models."
1,A self indulgent dud,"Jane seems to become increasingly self-absorbed as the years wear on. On this CD though her voice is still lovely, her delivery is hardly inspired. For music that should be intimate, she has choosen to over-produce herself, multitracking and correcting her vocals. It is awfully bland. Lets hope she wakes up in the next few years and produces something interesting again."
5,GOOSEBUMPS!!!!!!,"I haven't had this cd in my hands for 24 hours yet and I feel like I must tell everyone about it!!! I'm a great fan of jane's music, and this cd is a magical collection. Her harmonies and production are outstanding!! Mellow, yes, but when your looking for that perfect, quiet cd to wash away all of the worlds noise, this will now be at the top of my list!! Thank you jane! I will look forward to all of your future projects with great excitement!! GOOSEBUMPS from start to finish!!!!!!!!"
3,"Great stuff, except...","The first time I listened to this I absolutely loved it. The second time, I noticed that Jane was having some pitch problems on several of the songs--most noticably on ""False False Fly"", but also on several of the other songs. Jane has a style of singing where she sometimes slurs into the center value of a note from slightly above or below--it works well on many of her own compositions, but I don't think it works well here.However, this is the sole flaw on this otherwise perfect disc, and I haven't read any other review anywhere that mentioned it (I suspect that my ears are more irritated by minor pitch errors than most people's). My final recommendation is that if you sometimes are annoyed by vocalists singing off pitch, then you need to avoid this CD--otherwise, if you're looking for a new and creative take on some old classic songs, then you are going to love it."
2,Not her strength,"Ol' Man River?????Siberry is a great artist and these are very nice, mostly traditional songs. But, the two do not mix very well.This mismatch is highlighted by Siberry singing Ol' Man River from the musical Showboat: ""Here we all work while the white folks play"".She sings it in a nice, sweet way, with her unique ethereal vocal style. There is no emotion and absolutely no sense of struggle. It would be like Barry White singing ""I Am Woman"".The rest of the songs on this CD, many emotional and powerful, are given the same emotionless lulaby treatment."
3,Pricey and not as great as I thought,"For a Nokia this buy waas a letdown for me. I wish it had some features like my previous samsung piece... a daily alarm, automatic dialpad locking, etc. I'm stuck with it for a at least another year. :-("
5,NOKIA rocks!!,"I've owned a couple MOTOROLA before and have to admit they do have cool-looking phones. They look so fashionable, stylish, and making you feel young. But...the only thing I hate is they dropped my calls a lot. I mean...A LOT! My calls would be just disconnected unreasonable when I only talked on my phone about 10-15mins. Sometimes even 5 mins!NOKIA, maybe some of their phones look chunky, not so cool as motorola, not-so-stylish kind of phones, but they DO HAVE the best quality of cell phones. Not mention the battery life, humanize functions, and of course, keeping stable while being used. I'll highly recommend NOKIA to anyone who are looking for a well made, great quality cell phone.And what is so good about Nokia 6682? Well, check out a lot reviews here and you'll see. They've got everything!"
2,Not a particularly good phone for just making phone calls,"I'm pretty disappointed in this phone. It's got poor battery life, and a complicated and buggy interface. It's also very large and bulky. Beyond that, the thing that annoys me most is that there doesn't seem to be any way to have it lock the keypad automatically after some idle period. The end result of that is that I forget to manually lock the keypad and it sits there beeping quietly in my pocket until the battery runs out or it calls a random person from my address book.Unless you want all the whiz-bang extra features for people with a data plan, I'd suggest sticking with a simpler phone that has a good battery life and basic phone features like keypad lock."
4,Great phone,Lots of nice stuff packed into this compact design. The camera is surprisingly very good.
2,verrrrrry complicated !!!!!!!!!!!,"this phone is very complicated phone to fidure out if you are not up to date with a""data"" cell phone BUT if you are a big business person and have alot of files to manage and data it is great> ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU LIKE IT GREATLY BECAUSE AMAZON WILL NOT LET YOU EXCHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Phone with great features, but ....","I am having this phone for past 1.5 years now.Features of this phone are really impressive (1.2 MP camera with sliding cover, Symbian OS, Office application etc.)It is little bit heavier than other smartphone (Blackberry Pearls, Sony Walkman). Keys are also very small and sometime troublesome to operate.However biggest problem with this phone is that it has that so called ""morning sickness"" problem. Phone gets frozen or automatically switches off every 4-5 days. I have all the latest firmware and so but that could not solve the problem.I was Nokia fan and all my previous phone were from Nokia. But I am very disappointed with this phone."
2,Heavy and hard to use,"I hate this phone.Pros: good reception, many features.Cons:Keyboard is tiny and hard to press the right one.Worn out easily near the edge.As heavy as a brick.Very slow bootup."
4,Worth buying it - 6682 Vs Razor,"I'm using it for the last one-week and so for so good.Pros:1. Screen is visble in bright sunlight too. Motorolla's Razor is just the opposite.2. Call Recpetion/ Speaker Phone/ Battery life or charge all are good.3. Camera's Image quality is between Ok and Good.4. Simple Navigation.Cons:1. Just a bit too big.2. Key pad space could have been more.3. Camera shutter/cover dosen't fit perfectly.Conclusion: I recommend u to buy this. It does it's job unlike Razor whose reception, screen, speaker phone, battery life - all are Compromise for it's sleek/stylish design. If you want a phone for communication buy this. If you want to show-off buy Razor."
4,Good phone,"Only problem I face, is the grip to the phone while talking is not too good. All the features I want are there, and I am using for almost a year, and still do not see any phone so good."
1,Customer service needs some training,"I recently ordered a new phone and also 3 other phones. I was already an existing customer with cingular. I talked with one of the customer service people at Amazon and they assured me that if I purchased the phones I could use the phone numbers I already had, WELL this is not the case. They prepurchase numbers from cingular and will not let you carry your new number with you, this is ridiculious, if the customer service people cannot tell you the truth, then why buy any products from them."
4,Amazing phone!!,"I bought this phone couple of months back and till date I am extremely happy with it. It's a bit bulky but somehow I do not like the sleek ones. I do feel good about it's weight. It has a wonderful camera @1.3 MP with a slot for memory stick. A 8MB stick also comes with the original box. So if you are photo freak then you can consider a bigger stick. But for casual photography the stick is sufficient.Being a Nokia, there is no doubt about navigation and ease of use. The software is good and does most the task with ease. I did have some problem installing the software but when installed, there was no problem at all. I do use it only occasionally.Just a reminder for those people who try to compare this with PDAs....this is not a PDA...its a smart phone.With holux GPS receiver and software you can actually make this phone a full fledged navigation system with voice, if you want."
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"Before I Buy ANYTHING, I always do my research and read EVERY review. I knew this was the phone I was going to get and when I got it, it was MUCH better than I expected.First I Like that its big and bulky. People seem to forget that TOO SMALL and THIN means easy to lose and fragile. I like that I can feel this phone at all times but its not so big that it protrudes. EVERYONE loves this phone.It is AMAZINGLY customizable, I can upload MP3s after installing the easy to use software it runs just like a Digital Camera. I can use MP3s as ringers change phone themes, Camera works really well, sounds great, bluetooth is nice if you have a good headset, and MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL RECEPTION IS AMAZING. I Went from VERIZON to CINGULAR in the NYC area and I can barely tell the difference which Im sure there is but its hard to tell.Razr is a good phone too but If you want to be a little different from everyone else, go with this."
5,enviro magic,I have used this on our boat for several years and have had excellent results. I use it on canvas enclosures and the indoor/outdoor carpet on the bridge and aft deck. It has a pleasant smell and it gets rid of the mildew short term. I know of nothing that works permanently on this type of growth.
3,Children's Christmas Favorites,"The Description of this CD is somewhat misleading (The devil is in the details). It is performed not by ""the"" Vaughn Monroe, but by the ""Vaughan Monroe Singers"" (whoever they are - note the ""Vaughn"" vs ""Vaughan"" spelling). The voice quality of these performers is not even close to Vaughn Monroe. The arrangements are also of a so-so quality. I'd give it a 2 1/2 if I could, but being in a generous holiday mood I bumped it up a notch. There are higher quality children compilations available."
2,Way too sticky/Very hard to remove,"We have been using these eye patches for our 3 year old daughter. Coverage is fantastic, but taking the patch off at the end of the day is an hour long endeavor with lots of screaming. The patches are SO sticky they literally pull out our daughter's eyebrow hairs and leave a giant red ring around her eye. We are trying a new brand and hope we have more success. I would not recommend this brand for small children."
4,gliding over all,"So I was at my brother in laws house, and I had to go to the bathroom (Number 2)I needed something to read, and as I reached I threw a few magazines aside and there it was, this book by Walt WhitmanAs I read the first poem all I could think is ""You got me!"" I was hooked."
3,Surprisingly light on the Windows,"For a book about Windows, this book has surprisingly little Windows specific information in it. The first chapter, on installation, is Windows specific. But then it doesn't go Windows specific until about 3/4s of the way through the book in section three, where it talks about COM, ADO, Active Directory and a couple of other Windows-specfic technologies.It's a short book, so the mid-section which is not Windows specific is a general reference for PHP. It's a brief reference though, weighing in at less than 100 pages, where other books (PHP and MySQL Web Development) spend over 150 pages on just the basics.I can't recommend this book unless you have a specific need for introductory information on PHP installation for Windows, or use of Windows specific back-end technologies like COM, ADO or the Active Directory."
4,Learning the art of War.,"16 year old Midshipwizard Halcyon Blithe is on his first voyage in the Navy after having finally come into his Wizard's abilities 8 months ago. He comes from a respectable family with a long history of honourable service in the Navy.While really written for teens, like so much of today's fantasy, this book is still an enjoyable read if you like your fantasy novels on the high seas. Halcyon learns some valuable lessons in this novel which starts us with his career in the Navy in a war which has been in progress for well over 20 years.This novel is an enjoyable introduction to this series and I hope to read more of this young man in future books. The book is an easy read, but its not a book of great depth in worldbuilding."
3,"An OK read, but Ward could do better","The idea of the series is a great one. Alternate Realities with a young sailor learning the ropes in a magical universe can be a lot of fun. For the most part, the world-building for the story is top-notch.However, Ward's work is choppy and his characters often cliched. The title character comes off as something of a Gary Stu, considering the number of advantages the author winds up giving him over the course of the first two books. Advantages that are belied by a naive foolishness that is often conveniently placed so as to ensure the plot keeps moving. Characterization of villains is also cliched, to the point that one half-expects them to twirl their mustaches as they foolishly put themselves in a position to be thwarted.Ward's writing shows promise, however, and while I probably won't buy any further books in the series, I will be reading them from the library until I see the improvement I think he's capable of."
1,Awful quality--looks nothing like ANY real plant I've seen.,"This does not deserve to be called an artificial plant. My best guess is that some hapless wage slave in an Asian factory jammed some pieces of plastic ""stalks"" into plastic pot half-filled with glue and tossed it onto a conveyor belt. Assembly time: 10 seconds, tops.The leaves are not shiny or glossy. Most of them look like they were rolled in dust. The stalks go every which way; I've had to bend about a third of them into a vaguely correct orientation. If a real plant looked like the one I pulled out of the box, I'd assume that it had been in a desert sandstorm for a week. The finished product looks like more like an arrangement of dying vinca leaves than a palm.One reviewer said that her cat was chewing at this product. It must have been out of disgust--no animal would be fooled by this ""tree."" This is easily the worst purchase I've made on Amazon--save your money, friend."
5,Very nice collection.,The many songs in this collection brings back so many memories of my youth. I highly recommend it too all.
4,Good product,I was looking for a new eyeglass case when I found this item. The only drawback I would have is that the case is wider than I expected but otherwise it fits the bill!
2,Capezio women's jr shoe,"Although I ordered a wide with shoe, it was much to tight in the toe so I could not wear.The quality was acceptable and the style was cute."
4,Great product,"I don't use this oil often, but when I do, I see instant results of frizz and fly aways."
5,smells sooooo good!.. absolutely delicious..,this oil is heavenly. i love the smell and versatility. you can use it in your hair.. put a few drops in your bubble bath.. or massage it directly onto your skin.. i get tons of compliments about the smell.. thanks for shipping to apo's!
1,Hair to dry,"OK saw the infomercial, thought I would try it out but didn't want to be sucked into the autoship ""feature"". So purchased through Amazon. I will say I gave this product a real go. But was a no go for me. The fig scent was a turn off from the start, and it does take a little getting use to with the product tingling in your hair. No separate conditioner etc. The oil for after use. Frankly left my hair really dry and if I used the oil afterward it went the other direction. It was all bad hair days for me for the few weeks I tried it. I guess my hair just needs more moister. Back to Aussie....at least I tried it."
2,"Good content, but very confusing and unreadable format.","especially in kindle, chapters are not ordered. every page references some other page. examples and scenarios mixed with subject mater making it very hard to navigate** MSDN links are not valid anymore"
5,A must-buy,"We've all read books on how to succeed. And we know they say more or less the same things. Reading this book gave me a new inspiration and a different perspective on success. Sidney Friedman is an under-rated author and speaker. He is not only a superstar in his industry, but a superstar on the international stage of business. Let his stories and insights inspire you to greater heights of success in any endeavour. You won't regret buying it."
1,Too many scratches,"I searched for a very long time for a case I liked and i thought this one was good. Unfortunately, by the 2 month mark, the case is completely scratched up. There are a few minor scratches on the iPod as well. It is difficult to even read the song titles through the screen on the case. It gets all these scratches from simply being in my pocket all day. If there are any good reviews of this case, then the person hasnt had the case long enough yet."
5,Love this case!!,"I love the simplicity and sturdiness of this case, but I am extra in love with the fact that it is clear all around, allowing me to see the stickers with which I festoon my Pod. Fits like a glove, locks like a safe, allows me access to all of the Pod features, and seems to afford it ample protection (but I can't confirm because I haven't [gasp!!] dropped it yet). Worth the few extra scudi in price."
2,"Not a book, it's a paper pamplet","I received the item today and am very disappointed with it. It is not a book of Iowa History, but instead is a little paper PAMPLET that fits into your pocket and only 36 tiny pages.I quote the exact wording on the inside of the 1st page ""Under the general title of ""Iowa and War"" the State Historical Society of Iowa undertakes to issue a series of small pamphlets dealing with a variety of subjects relating to military matters connected with the history of Iowa. Since these pamphlets are in no sense a monographic series, bibliogrphical data and academic citation of authorities are omitted. There contents are none the less based upon critical studies and reliable sources of information."""
2,What the---?,"More than a bit of a let down, DER BLAU ENGEL pads out 3 worthwhile tunes with an awful lot of gibberish that should never have seen the light of day."
4,Good for Travel,The small makeup brush kit is good for travel.It is inexpensive and you can tell they are made from cheap materials. I would not use them for everyday use.
2,NOT FOR THE SEEKERS OF INFORMATION ABOUT STERIODS,"WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY? THE NAME SAYS ANABOLIC IN IT SO IT MUST CONTAIN INFORMATIN ABOUT STERIODS? NO SO MY FRIEND. I MEAN THERE ARE SOME STUFF ABOUT STERIODS IN IT,BUT YOU WOULD LEARN MORE BY VISITING A STERIOD WEB SITE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ARE A NTURAL BODYBUILDER AND ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO PACK SIZE AND STRENGTH, TAKE GOOD SUPLMENTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT YOU COULD BUY THIS BOOK. ALTHOUGH, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT MOST OF THE STUFF THAT THEY LOOK AT IN THIS BOOK ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE EITHER MADE BY MUSCLEMUG OR THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SPONSER THE MAGAZINE, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE HARD FACTS BUT RATHER WHAT THE SPONSERS TELL THEM TO PUT IN."
2,Too many pictuers and no detailed info,"I wanted to learn more about steroids. Hands on info. Dosages, stacking etc. This book contains 5 pages about specific steroids. You would learn moreabout steroids in any SteroidSite. Too much personal comments from the author's rather than hard facts."
1,disappointed,I ordered this book for my husband little did I know that the picture and the actual book that shipped would be different. A completly different copy from like the 80's arrived instead of what you see in the picture.
5,Anabol Primer,"This book is very informative for those individuals who are passionate in their bodybuilding/bodysculpting quest and although there have been advancements in the science of the art/sport the contents within these pages are valuable not only for the novice but also for the advanced who could use a quick reference when needed. For the price I paid, it can't be beat! Thank You!"
4,Its pretty good,"This book deals with steroids on a very general basis. The information about other substances such as fat burning supplements is generally very well done. They're a lot of pictures, but they highlight the topics well. Overall its useful for its information on things other than steroids."
1,"MuscleTech, ooops, I mean MuscleMag","It is no secret that MuscleMag International is nothing more than a soapbox for MuscleTech. Don't get me wrong, I used MuscleTech products and they worked for me. However, since there are no longer Nortesten and Anotesten (sorry if I misspelled) they have lost me as a customer. Try Universal Nutrition products, they are better anyway."
4,Departure,"It takes 5 years between Moodswings albums and I was so looking forward to another 5 star album. Unlike the first two, this is completely ambient. Very few ambient albums have remained in my collection.With that bias, this effort is better than most, thanks to Debussy. Several tracks have exquisite passages but I actually thought Disk 2 was damaged because of a horrible flutter effect at the 7:44 mark of the first track. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"The two previos Moodswing discs are uplifting, flowing, and a source of inspiration to be productive. When ""horizontal"" was released and I saw it was a double disc I was thrilled. To my disappointment, both discs seem to only be the groundwork for another finished product. The first disc is almost nondiscipt that it seems to be a whole disc of intros. The second adds some interest by adding some rhythm, but still never seems to get going. Don't bother buying this set unless you are ready to sleep and not realize that you are listening to a musician that has produced a couple of your favorite discs. Just replay the previos two discs and hope that the next project will have some life."
2,"Finally, a Chill Out CD to share with your mother!","There are a couple of great moments on the two CD set, but most are lost amid a fog of lush melodies that you can't help but sense you've heard before (like maybe your last elevator ride)."
3,This dvd was a disappointment for me.,"The reviews about this dvd I read said that the material on this dvd may be ""disturbing to some viewers"" and I didn't see anything that I hadn't seen before so maybe it was just the fact that the Nazi's used euthanasia to kill anyone who didn't fit in with their plan that may disturb people who never knew about the T4 program."
3,generally does the job,"This is a well-known product and a clever idea, allowing you to begin a charcoal fire with a single sheet of newspaper. It works about 3/4s of the time. The ""chimney"" is somewhat smaller than I would like, and it is made of light materials."
4,Lon's Home movie,"Lon Milo DuQuette is indeed a shameless self promoter. This ""film"" was of a very amateur caliber. Now that's been said, I wish to let any student of the arcane arts know, this man knows his stuff. His enthusiasm for the Kabbalah and Tarot is contagious. I never had much need for mathematics in my life and have been awakened by Mr. DuQuette to it's ""numerous"" possibilities. I would consider this film to be an appetizer,leading perhaps to reading and truly savouring one or more of his literary works he can be seen touting in his DVD."
5,FIVE -STAR DVD FROM Lon Milo Duqette,Lon Milo DuQuette has long been recognized as an excellent teacher on the occult topics in this DVD. He uses humor to teach and it works so very well.His song-writing proves he is a modern bard like Tom Leher or the Smothers Brothers. This is a DVD of his class and you can watch it at home if you cannot get to see him on his lecture circuit. I totally recommend it.Lady Janestra
4,great little thing,Holds a few of these XD cards and the reader I have all in one little bundle. Great little thing to have everything on hand.
5,Great Cat Tree! A+++++++,"My mother bought this for my sister's three cats who live in an apartment. They love it! I wish I could include pictures. It was not too difficult to assemble, my sister says it is stable. The cats were very excited about it, played with the pompoms and are sleeping on the different levels. They have used all the scratching posts also. It is placed near a window so that is an added bonus. We are very pleased with this product. A tree with less features was found at a local store for more money. It is a good deal for the product."
4,"A look into Laura's adult life, and her writing skills","For those out there who feel that Laura's daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, did most of the actual writing of the ""Little House"" books - well, you should read this book, which consists of letters written to her husband, Almanzo, while she was visiting San Francisco in 1915. Even though they were not written for publication, her descriptions of the events of the Pan-Pacific Expo, as well as San Francisco itself, are vivid, captivating, and colorful. You can also feel the great love and affection that existed between the couple, even though there are no letters from Almanzo himself. I also found this book interesting as I live in the San Francisco Bay Area myself, and am interested in its history."
5,Wahoo! It's back in print!,Hurrah! DE Stevenson is back in print! This is a fabulous read. Charming and funny it is a wonderful escape to a cozy world. You will love to spend time here. I hope this means that more of Ms Stevenson's books will be available again.
5,Lovely,"I picked up Miss Buncle on a whim, thinking it was a new novel. I was well into the book when I checked the copyright again and realized it was written in the 1930s, making it all the more fun to read. Miss Buncle's Book is the perfect place to escape the winter blues or the stresses of society today. You won't find violence, profanity, sex, or politics in this book but, if you're like me, you will find a cast of delightfully human characters who ring true while making you laugh out loud."
4,Basic Brit Lit,This is a pleasant read. Miss Buncle is a bit of Brit Lit fantasy. Light reading for a gloomy weather day.
3,"Excellent content, impossible translation","It is never a good thing to have to read a book that has been translated, but cookbooks that have been translated into the English language are usually quite acceptable. It is a shame that the translation of this book was not revised by a native English speaker. Some of the instructions are true riddles. And the terminology is more than a little odd. This fine edition would justify hiring a qualified translator."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"Have you ever wondered exactly what a covenant is all about? Just what benefits, if any, would you as a believer receive frommaking a covenant with God?

4,My ten year old loves it!!,I bought this for my ten year old boy for Halloween. He really likes it. The mask is a little flimsy but all in all the costume is a good bargain.Costume Supercented shipped on time and the product arrived as expected.
3,Good deal for the price,"My son really wanted the Jango Fett costume for Halloween. I was not interested in buying the more expensive version for something he would wear once, so opted for this version. Sizing seems small, so consider a larger size if purchasing."
2,"Thought I was buying a NEW product, but DUPED!","I spotted this costume in WalMart for my son for Halloween, but they didn't have his size. I came to order it from Amazon, and when it arrived it had CLEARLY been used. Packaging open, all tags were gone, the mask was missing paint and had dings and rubs consistent with a few aggressive wearings. That doesn't take away from my son's enjoyment of it or his use of it for Halloween, but come on - if buy a brand new product, I expect a BRAND NEW PRODUCT. It's not like I paid half price for this or anything"
1,Face Mask Awful,"Bought this costume for my six year old. The costume is fine but the face mask is terrible. It came out of the box warped, paint chipped off, and words from the packaging were transposed onto the front of it. It smashes my son's nose and the visibility is almost zero. Would not recommend at all...my son is beyond dissappointed."
3,Halloween Costume,"Bought this costume for my son, it fit larger than we expected. The paint on the mask was rubbed off when we took it out of the package, but my husband just covered up the spots with a marker. It was easy to wash, easy to wear and I'm sure my son will be happy to use it again next year."
4,Jango Fett Halloween Costume,My son wore this for Halloween. It was a decent price. The only real issue I had was the helmet which was a mask. I didn't really care for that. Otherwise it was fine. He still plays in it a few months after Halloween.
1,Worst possible Quality,"The fabric of the costume disintegrated on the first day - a big disappointment. It is very, very cheap and thin. The mask (it's not a helmet!) is an utter disgrace and the kids did not like to wear it at all. Absolutely not worth even half the price you'd pay on big sale.I will contact Amazon CS about it - but we would not want to receive a replacement. I would rather just throw this out and write it off under 'cheap crap from China I should not have bought'."
3,It's a cheap Halloween costume - it worked for it's a few wearings and my son enjoyed it.,How much can really be said about this - it is what it is....it's a Halloween costume on the cheap side. It's lasted 3 or 4 wearings and my son really enjoyed it - that's its job and it did it well. It might last a few games of dress up but not much more than that.
5,a great Halloween costume,this is a great looking suit and my grandson loved it. He cannot wait for Halloween!
4,"Overall, very happy!",I haven't had any problem thus far with the HRM or the watch. it has some great features and it fairly easy to use.
3,Worked for 2 years,"I bought this HRM in 2006 and it lasted for 2 years. I did not use it consistently during this time either. I tried to change the battery because the belt stopped working but that did not help.It's great for calorie counting but there is no distance tracker and the chest belt slides down during heavy aerobic workouts, causing the watch to stop counting calories.Today, I purchased a Polar instead."
3,Limited Range,"Accurate temperature reads, but the unit can't be too far from the transmitter, otherwise it doesn't work. I've worked out a place for the unit, but it isn't where I wanted it to be."
3,"Okay, but not memorable","This book was entertaining, but not captivating. This was my first Rebecca York book and my last."
1,Wrong size,"Recently this chain was advertised to fit Husqvarna saws including the model I have (142). Amazon sold it through a company called Mowtownusa. I ordered the chain and when I was ready to use it I found that it was too small. I began the return process only to discover that Mowtownusa had a 10 day return policy. I expected it to be a 30 day policy like other items sold through Amazon. I contacted Mowtownusa but they never replied. I advise other customers to avoid buying any item from Mowtownusa. Hopefully, Amazon will quit directing customers to this outfit.Now this chain is advertised to fit only Poulan saws. I am stuck with a $22 chain that is of no use to me."
2,Still Waiting,I did not recieve this product Woodys refunded my purchase price after four attempts to send the correct item!!
2,Not very fun!,"We bought this toy for our 5 year old son, who loves Pirates of the Carribean. The toy seems smaller than the picture, about 14"" long and 12-14"" high. The remote (requires 9v battery) has two buttons, one to make it go forward, and one to make turns to the right. Works fairly decently on the linoleum or flat surface, but does not work well at all in the carpet, even very short pile carpet. It will not go forward or turn. The boat rocks up and down as it moves along. Our son, lost interest in about 3 minutes. The figures, cannon, and deck space are too small, and not really useable for kids to play with."
4,Cool Toy,"I bought this pirate ship for a 4 year old boy and he loved it. The motor inside was a little loud, but other than that it's great. He played with it for hours and to be honest I did also."
4,Timely Collection from an amazing songstress!,"All Natalie's key big hit for Capitol areincluded and the abundance of strong albumtracks from 1975-81 era. Her whole ""NatalieLive"" album is a treat and it's great to hear3 tracks were added to this anthology. Everyone probably has there favorites that weren'tadded. Missing are ""Still In Love"" and at leastone great duet with Peabo like ""Gimme Some Time""or their stunning re-make of Natalie's self-penned""Your Lonely Heart."" Kudos to the compilerfor adding gems like the soulful ""Hold On"" andthe plaintive ""I'm Sorry."""
2,Not a great book,It seems that this book is far too concerned with Terry Gilliam's and Terry Jones' ways of directing and getting the shots right. Furthermore the author has only interviewed a couple of the Pythons himself and largely have depended on old articles and books by and about the group.
4,Wow,"Delivered quickly even though on super saver. Easy set up. I am a heavy smoker and started the purifier on high. It turned the smokey stale air in my apartment into clean fresh air smell in less than an hour! Afterwards I turned in to medium on level 3 so I could run it 24/7. On medium, I can still smell a little smokey air but it keeps the air much cleaner than it use to be."
5,Well worth the money,"I am very impressed by this purifier. We had a small mold issue in our home, so we bought two of these for the bedrooms. Before buying these, my family was coughing and sneezing a lot! After a few days of having these in the home, everyone is coughing and sneezing way less, if at all. We replace the carbon filters very frequently and they are really disgusting when we do.My advice is to buy this and replace carbon filters often to increase the efficiency of this unit."
2,I had two with problems,"The first one of these I got produced an incredible amount of static electricity. I would walk within a few feet of it and shock anything that I touched. My cat would do the same thing, and shock me whenever it touched me, if it was by the purifier.So I got a replacement for it, and it seemed to produce a lot less static electricity, but after a few days there was a burning plastic smell emitting from it. I have also tried a different model of Holmes and had the same problem with the burning smell emitting from it after a few days.Lots of people have good luck with theirs it seems, but I didn't. It was nice when it worked, I loved it, but it didn't last for me. Hit or miss I guess."
3,Noisy,"Its very noisy but highly effective on the high setting and not very effective, but quiet, ,on the lower settings."
3,Quiet apparently effective but 3 hepa filters at $24 each,Seems like a very good unit.. quiet air flow quite good but the only drawback that I can measure is the cost of the three ( 3 ) hepa filters at $24.95 each.. Maybe the filters are less somewhere other than Holmes.. can't seem to locate part no. HAPF600CS..Would not take long to exceed the cost of a more expensive /presumably better unit that had longer life or self cleaning filters. Razor and Blade scenerio seems to be the typical marketing strategy for most of these types of units.
4,No more sneezing...,"Currently live in a carpeted studio, no more sneezing, running eyes since I bought this air purifier. Pretty good device."
3,"Good for the price, but didn't help me.","The trouble with these things is, while they work okay, it's 50/50 whether what they're doing will help you at all. The sound level on these is okay, and they do definitely clean the air, but it didn't do much for me. My wife's symptoms improved slightly, but not enough to justify spending the money, and certainly not enough to buy new filters for it in the future. Probably a good example of the breed if it helps you, but these air filters may just not be the solution for everyone."
3,wrong buttons,"I just received this item so only time will tell if it works as it should. However I will say that it came with two + buttons instead of a + and a - like it should be. Also, be aware that this is not a table top purifier, it is a large appliance. It was larger than I expected, but that is my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. No big deal though, I have room."
2,look good but wont last,i have these lights about 5 months but have them turned on about 7 or 8 times during the summer night. Now 1 of them is burned out. i called recon to ask for replacement bulbs but was told that the bulbs are NOT servicable. you have to replace the whole since the Xenon gas filled style bulbs last only 6 months or so according google search. i looking for other set that the bulbs are servicable so i won't have to replace the whole len & base each time that increase the chance water leaking into the cab.
4,good product,"The lights look great and match up to the existing factory holes well.The lights have plugs that plug right into the factory connections, the connections are a little loose. A couple of the lights didn't make a good connection at first. If I have any issues I will hard wire instead of using the connections."
2,"Look elsewhere, not worth the money","I installed these lights on my Ford 250 about a year now, they look very good. However, here is the rest of the story! In the year I have had them installed, one light has already gone out due to water in the lights. I ordered a single light from Recon, which took 2 weeks to arrive and the shipping cost was about 50% of the cost of the lights itself. I have now another light that is leaking and suspect it will go out in about a month or so, and will need to be replaced. This is not unusual for recon products, I have a rear light bar which I have also had to replace due to water. I'm replacing the Recon products with Plasmaglow, which I think has better quality control, but time will tell."
2,Disappointed -- mediocre vocals and (too) jangly guitar,"I really wanted to love this CD, especially after all the positive reviews for Daddy a Go Go, including comparisons to the Beatles Revolver era.Yikes. Not so.If you can tolerate mediocre singing, a non-stop jangly guitar, C-level back-up musicians, and not-so-clever lyrics, you might be OK with this CD. It does have a bit of a country sound to it -- maybe country music fans will like it more than I do.I was especially looking forward to ""Come on Get Happy"" (cover of Partidge Family), but Daddy a Go Go's version is almost unrecognizable as the same song.I'm just really disappointed with it. I'm taking it to work with me today and offering it to anyone who wants it for free.I'm going to stick with Ralph's World."
5,Teturn of the grilled cheese,This replaced the dead cord on my electric grill. I had searched the web for a replacement but couldn't find one. Now I'm happy again!
1,Missing Parts,"The tape measure is held together by 8 sets of small bolts and nuts. Several of the nuts and bolts arrived loose in the package and one was completely missing. I installed the loose bolts and tightened everything down, but there was the one I could not find and presumably fell out of the packageing."
4,Start Me Up,"The songs are catchy and the production is great, but at the core this is still more funny folk than authentic folk.The Glimmer Twin cover is worth the price of admission.Long live Derek Smalls."
5,Mitch and Mickey Were Robbed!!,"I'm talking, of course, about ""A Kiss..."" NOT winning the Oscar for best song, when it was head and shoulders above ""Into The West"" and the other nominated songs!!!! Yes, the movie was a ""mockumentary,"" but the music on this soundtrack is just divine. Many folk acts from the 60's would have been proud to write a song as good as ""When You're Next To Me"" or ""Never Did No Wanderin."" The soundtrack does the seemingly impossible job of mocking the folk genre, while at the same time delivering songs with staying power. Put it on repeat and go back to a time when the SONGS were the key to music, not breast baring and butt shaking!!"
5,mighty wind cd,watched movie liked music so ordered cd- love it /fun to listen to-some songs are just for fun-folksy
5,Awesome Soundtrack,I love this movie and I love the soundtrack. Some of the songs are sweet (Kiss at the End of the Rainbow) and some are really funny (Skeletons of Quinto). I listen to it over and over.
5,Good things come in small packages,"This is one sleek sexy little gadget with a tremendously beautiful screen. With excellent sound, its a perfect tool for those long car/plane trips so you can watch those big screen blockbusters anytime,anyplace without losing anything. Its also perfect for use as your home DVD player as it hooks up easy to your home TV. It has a good battery life so you could watch almost any movie and then watch the extras on just one charge (which is about 3 hours so it would be hard to watch the Lord of the Rings extended versions and the extras too lol). But as i watch Spider-Man on it right now it is just an amazing little thing."
3,AUTO / AIRLINE POWER ADAPTOR FOR DVP-FX700,"In response to a question posed by a few other people for the Sony DVP-FX700, a great auto/airline adaptor is the Targus Mobile Power Inverter (90 Watts, Targus Model PAPWR005U), available right here on Amazon.It has a removable tip on the 12V car plug which converts the input to the plug necessary for a 75W airline business class seat voltage outlet.The AC adaptor of the -700 plugs directly into the Targus unit.I successfully used the Targus unit to run/charge the -700 in business class on Qantas, and also used it to re-charge a Sony VAIO notebook battery."
4,Good Christmas jazz compilation,"Sax for the Season Winter's Cool is great for playing in the background and listening to as you do other things. Very smooth, goes well with Winter's Fire (which I prefer).Really good generic compilation of Christmas smooth jazz."
4,order ID#0012245257-4902633,"Dear Sachin, I recieved the second order. It is still not correct. I still have not recieved the 2nd volume of the 2 volume set. I am still missing the book entitled ""Make the Most of Available Personnel with Football's Modern Flexing Offense"". I instead recieved another copy of ""The Winning Secrets of Football's Great Offensive Attacks"". I will return the 2nd copy this week. PLease send the correct 2nd volume A.S.A.P. Thank You, Frank Lenti"
5,A correction,"This isn't a review, but a correction of what a previous poster said. The breathtaking bassoon solo was actually performed by Danny Matsukawa (now principal bassoon in Philadelphia), not Judith LeClaire. Ms. LeClaire was on maternity leave at the time of this live recording and Mr. Matsukawa was engaged to play for this concert."
2,Too Much Extraneous Noise!!,"I agree that it is an excellent interpretation and performance. Sonically it is great. That is the good part and based on that I would give it 4 or even 5 stars.The reason I only gave it two stars is all the noise from orchrestra members (I presume). There is a lot of coughing, clearing throats, squeaking chairs and shuffling feet. It is very noticeable in the soft parts throughout the recording. It is what I expect to hear in a live performance from an audience not from a ""studio"" performance in Avery Fisher Hall or wherever.I would not buy this CD again!!"
1,Better Available!,"I used these on my 2-1/2 yr old son for a few days and they were horrible! They seemed to really bother him and they hurt him terribly when removed. So much that he cried and after the first time didn't want me to remove it at all because of the pain he expected. As soon as the Coverlet brand arrived via Amazon we switched back to those, no problems! No pain, no irritation, now he says, ""this kind does not hurt."" Buy Coverlets, not Nexcare!"
2,Not so great,"We have used both Nexcare and Ortopad patches for our daughter and find that these are not our preference. The adhesive does not stick very well and additionally seems to cause discomfort to her, as she constantly rubs her face when wearing these, but not with the Ortopads. Also, we can usually get 2-3 wears from the Ortopads, whereas these will definitely not stick a second time.All and all, these patches get the job done, but if you are using patches every day, there's a better option."
3,Great with the adhesive...sucks for sensitive skin,The Nexcare really stick!! These patches are a little on the small side. Even for my one year old. My son got a light rash around the eyebrow part of his eye and I felt really bad for him to have to continue to put the patch on. We didn't have any other options at the time. We ordered the ortopad and for the most part the adhesive sticks and they are a good size.
3,Great information-awful read,"I had to purchase this book for a Special Education class I am taking for my major. This book has really, really great information in it. There are tons of examples to use for students with LD. There are games, manipulatives, examples, toys, even steps for lessons to use in the classroom. My problem with this book is that it is absolutely awful to read. I am a junior in college and I have definitely been around my fair share of textbooks and this has got to be the worst one of them all. There are charts and diagrams of the examples they suggest but other than that, it's just column after column of words. It is not organized in a way that makes it appealing and this is something I just cannot get past. If you can get past that, it has great information that would be useful to any Special Education teacher, or really any teacher in general. I simply gave it 3 stars because I am indifferent towards the book because of the organization and layout."
3,POOR QUALITY,This has 4 movies. You cannot see Dr Wai and the scripture with no words because it looks too blurry. Legend of Kung fu hero is not a movie it's footage of people demonstrating different styles of martial arts but the quality of image is poor. I liked Lee-Thal weapon because here Jet speaks about his career and you learn about him. Evil Cult is OK. I gave it 3 stars because I love Jet Li and I like the part in LEE-THAL WEAPON where they show him in his first movie Shaolin Temple and he looks perfect practicing his martial arts.
1,Almost Junk Collection,Only the first movie was watchable and have a decent plot; but I already have that movie. The rest were either not viewable or amature capture from tape to dvd.
5,Nice!,"I bought this for my 17 year old brother in law for Christmas. He has become a Jet Li fan because of my influence, so I was more than pleased to add this to his collection. He has enjoyed it thus far."
4,It performed better over time,"We run a medium sized attraction and require a reliable cash counter for every day use. It took about 2 weeks of playing with the calibration to get a consistent response. We also found the counterfeit detection to be a little overzealous (no one counterfeits $1 bills do they?). So we sometimes just turn that feature off. It's fast and much quieter than our old counter. If, say a folded bill does hang it up, once you straighten the bill the machine resumes the count and gives you an accurate total. Our old machine required you to start over. So that too is another plus. We do like the 2yr warranty. It's been a month now and overall it had risen in our estimation over time."
3,yellow counter,"When the product arrived, it had a yellow color - not the best color. My secretaries didn't like the color, so I had to resell it. I would have appreciated if they had told me that it was yellow."
5,Absolutely Riveting! Spellbinding! Horrific!,"For those of you who still haven't picked up this book, what are you waiting for? This book contains 4 of the most amazing novellas I've ever read! The combination of Mr. Lebbon's poetic descriptions and terrifying horrors make this a collection that any horror fan will treasure."
2,pretty sorry,Has very little erotic type stories. Says lay back close your eyes and fantasize. Hard to do when you have to watch the boring story line. Very disapointed and for what it cost we expected alot more.
3,Stocking Stuffer,Gave this to a college student as a Christmas gift. He is doing a paper on porn. He said it did not help his research and did not stimulate his libido.
3,Weird horror radio artifacts.. pretty clunky to these ears.,"Produced for the 1940s creep show ""Sealed Book"" these adaptations play like ""Classics Illustrated"" comic books read-aloud. Written in stilted ""classical"" fairy-tale-style language and woodenly read by 3rd-tier voice actors.. these stories are so bad as to have their own fascination. SPOILER: For the record, ""The Werewolf"" isn't at all squeamish about killing off (a couple of) kids."
4,Silent Night,"A must view by everyone. We all could learn many lessons from this family's strength and determination to 'stick' by their morals. How many today would face the enemy as they did and yet administer aid, feed them and provide shelter if needed?"
5,Worth Staying Up Late For,"It truly is worth drinking a pot of coffee if it's on at 3:00am. A film that warms the heart and shivers your spine - it's being a true tale dignifies humanity like few other films could convey. It's unfortunate that it's true in a way, that through the horror of war does the face of human compassion show itself the best.I'd suggest this film be shown in the auditorium of schools everywhere."
5,Great movie,"I really enjoy this movie because it illustrates the stupidity and tragedy of war, and brings home the message that when we take away the propaganda and hatred, we find we have more in common than we have to fight about."
1,Awful !,"I'm sorry, but this movie is a joke. I am German and and I can't hardly understand what they are trying to say.They should have made a better attempt at finding German speaking actors or teaching them better pronunciation .Linda Hamilton makes a lame German. We don't act like that. Besides, in a real life war they would have shot her bossy a** and left it out side.Which grown men just leave their weapons outside because she doesn't want them in their house, in the middle of war? Please, I could have written a better script."
2,Silent Night Hallmark Movie,I am actually watching this on the Hallmark Channel as I write this and boy I got a tell this is one low budget christmas movie. The acting is pretty sad and you can see Linda Hamilton looks like she is just happy to have gotten a job ( Now there is the spirit of Christmas).This story is so unbelievable that you hope a tiger tank will come soon and put and end to it. Oh joy the wound guy just woke up pointing the gun we saw him passed out with earlier gee now there is dramatic tension for ya.Well happy Christmas in July to everyone.
5,Watch This Movie!,"Is the holiday season causing chaos in your household? Presents to wrap, cookies to bake, shopping to be done? Well, take some time out to watch this charming movie, which reminds us all about the real ""reason for the season"". If you are into WWII, if you enjoy a good Christmas movie, or if you just want to lose yourself for a couple of hours in the kind of movie that allows you to do so, this is the film for you. Not only is Linda Hamilton great, but wonder of wonders, the child actor in this movie is actually believable(!) and will draw you in. Watch this movie with your kids. Even better, watch this movie with your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. You will not walk away from this film unaffected."
3,Grainy,"Great movie, if you like WWII movies. Great actors. Interesting story. Masterful character development. Really good Christmas story - but not the Gospel. My problem is the video quality of the movie itself. It's grainy. This was amade-for-TV movie, which could have been a movie movie. We gave away our good non-grainy copy of the movie and just sought to replace ours. Every replacement movie has been grainy. I'd watch it anyway. The movie is really good and a really good Christmas movie."
5,Story of a true Christmas Miracle!!!!,"I stumbled across this movie while searching for sometime to watch. As I like Linda Hamilton, I decided to watch it. This movie really speaks of the fact that if we can focus on our simlarities, we can find a way to overcome our differences! I can tell you that this movie will be added to the movies that are a staple of our Christmas tradition. It has a great combination of good acting, a touching true story, a Christmas miracle, and a lesson for everyone! I highly recommend this movie! It shows that miracles can and do happen!!!"
2,nope,"The first two songs are good, but these same songs are on ""Wiretap Scars"" (their first EP) - get that insteadthe singing on the whole EP is not very good, but the guitars are kinda cool.The 3rd song is fairly generic and the last track is just blatant filler - a stupid drumbeat with some low-fi noise...the sleeve artwork sucks, too1 and 1/2 star"
3,good but not great... yet,"While Mars Volta went on to experiment in a different kind of rock sound, Sparta sticks with the sound that At the drive-in had nurtured for 6 or so years before they went different ways. Austere sounds like a mix of Relationship of Command and In/Casino/out, with a lot of tweaking on the Pro Tools, giving the EP somewhat of a techno feel that was very foreign to any of the ATDI album. This release did not quite live up to the standards that the 3 members in Sparta had set before with ATDI, the songwriting was shaky and erratic, but it was still good anyways.I keep comparing them to ATDI and Mars Volta which is unfortunate because Sparta still seems like they are experimenting with their sound and haven't quite finished messing around. But this is not a bad thing, as this was only an EP and only their first release as Sparta. I look forward to their Full Length release in late summer of this year."
4,I want more,"This album is great and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it only contained 4 songs. I know that it is only an EP, but after listening to it, I wanted more. I can't wait for the album to come out this summer. I saw these guys on tour with Thursday, and let me tell you, they were frickin good. If you miss ATDI, this album will fill any void. In my opinion the best song is ""Cataract"". It is so sick and the coolest song I hav heard in a long time."
4,"Very nice teaser, now lets get the full deal","I was shocked to discover that At The Drive-In had broken up. I thought their last album was something else, in a good way. Needless to say, I was shocked once again to find that 3 of the boys of ATDI had reformed and are now known as Sparta. I would describe their sound as a gentler ATDI. The old sound is still there, but with less aggression, but this isn't to say that it doesn't pick up in places. I like the idea of releasing an EP to keep the fans happy and now look forward to their full length debut sometime soon. If you're a fan of ATDI or are just damn tired of the [stuff] that's currently available, then I advise you to pick this one up. With some luck these guys will be around for some time."
2,Excellent framework,"While the framework is nicely structured, I was not able to get a good picture of how to implement the idea. As a startup's founder, I find the book of little help - maybe for established incumbents it would be different."
2,A must have but not this version,This is a must have album but stay away from the Van Gelder version because it sounds horrible. The distortion is brutal and proves how bad a digital transfer can be.
5,Smoothest of the smooth,"I believe it was Gregg Allman who said that if your woman can't feel anything in this album, she has no soul!! Truly a masterpiece!!"
5,"A masterful ""Sermon""!!!","""The Sermon "", the album that established Jimmy Smith as the absolute master of the Hammond B-3 Organ is back in this excellently produced remaster. Boasting a who's who of great jazz musicians including Art Blakey, Kenny Burrell, Lou Donaldson, Lee Morgan, and Tina Brooks, the group smokes all the way through this album. There's really not much more that can be said that hasn't already been said. It's impossible to overpraise this masterwork of ensemble musicianship. This reissue like all the other excellent Blue Note reissues is produced by Grammy winning producer Michael Cuscuna, and remastered by engineering genius Rudy Van Gelder. A watershed jazz recording and essential part of any jazz collection."
1,Technology outdated,"Don't buy this modem at this point the technology is outdated They run, but they run really slow. I have the 5 light modem that runs really good and made the mistake of thinking this would do the same but there is a big difference in speed, Don't waste your money like I did!"
1,Yikes...,"When I first subscribed to SBC/Yahoo DSL, this was the modem that shipped with it. I was connected at 100 Mbps, but was only surfacing a download speed that maxed out at just above 20 KB/s. I checked my computer for anything that would slow it down, but nothing. I called AT&T and they said the ping was fine and modems don't affect speed. I recently changed over to the Motorola SB5120 Surfboard Modem, and my download speed spiked to about 300 KB/s. Same thing with my friend except even lower speeds."
4,using it,This is what I am currently using for my DSL connection since I got it as part of my DSL service from SBC 2 years ago.I should upgrade if I knew more about how DSL works.
4,Vintage Marx Brothers,"Given the fact that Marx Brothers CDs are very rare, this CD containing music and dialog from A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, ANIMAL CRACKERS, AT THE CIRCUS, and ROOM SERVICE is a real treat. Since these movies were made over 60 years ago, one should not expect the greatest audio quality..but who cares? It's the material and nostalgia factor of these recordings that really matters. Contained in this collection are classics like: Cosi Cosa; Hooray For Captain Spaulding; and Lydia The Tattooed Lady, to mention a few of the many gems. My only small gripe is that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA was short-changed omitting the classic moments from IL Trovatore, including the hilarious ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"" that was inserted in the overture. However, this is a small matter considering the many virtues of the CD. Available are additional soundtracks of other classic Marx Brothers movies, all worth investigating as well. Recommended."
4,Replacement phone,"This was a replacement for a phone which was part of a fax, printer, roam phone. The phone had been used so much that the rubber buttons no longer pressed easily. The replacement works well."
5,Good item ok price.,Good item ok price. I didnt know it would come without the base and i did find it with base much cheaper at buy.com Thanks
5,Brother Cordless Handset,"Brother BCLD10 5.8 Digital Cordless Handset Expansion for use with IntelliFax-1960c, IntelliFax-2580c, MFC-845CWExactly what I needed to replace a worn Brother cordless handset for my multifunction machine. The answer buttons wear after use and this handset replaces. Easy to install."
1,Horible,This Pad crumbles up when you do your fast songs like 3 2 1 stars i couldnt play heavy on this pad with out it ripping i have to play on light to keep from ripping!I got a rip all the way down the pad and out in the right arrow i got 7 of these until i gave up! get the Ignition 2.0 Dance Pad for PlayStation2 and Xbox it works great kinda like the arcade sure its another $50 more then this but it works 50x better!
2,You can definitely do better,"I assumed this dance pad would be decent due to its price. Wrong! On the very first day I had it, the down and up arrows would randomly stop registering. It slides around, crumples up, and sometimes gets stuck on an arrow. Basically, the only thing it has going for it is wirelessness. Get a RedOctance dance pad instead - I wish I had."
1,Dissapointing,"This is a horrible pad. I purchased this from Toys ""R"" Us yesterday, and it was not working. It did not even have any instructions! I immediately returned it and purchased a different one. It also did not work. It seems as if they were returned items. It looked to be re-sealed, and there was even tape on one of the pads which I purchased that was on a broken battery covering. I thought I was the only one that was having problems, but apparently not. I strongly do not recommend this product. These pads are not manufactured well at all, and it seems as if they are all defective."
1,Doesn't work and Doesn't Reset,"Same problem here!!! The receiver NEVER stopped flashing, and a connection was never established with the mat. What a piece of junk!"
3,Dance Pad,Dance pad is good material but the sensors for the arrows seem to not be in place or move around while you dance. The calibration is a little off. It seems to be slow. Dance pads need flatting often to keep sensors in place. It's a decent buy for the price but be aware of small problems.
2,Playstation,"Bought this for my daughter as a gift, she use it the first week and like most electronic games pushed it to the side and was bored with it."
2,Arrows Don't Work in Play Mode,"We purchased this for my daughters birthday or possibly Christmas (We weren't sure but we knew she would like it for something). Christmas finally came around and we threw it in with her Christmas things she tried it and said she didn't like the flashing arrows. A couple more months and I finally tried it out and now I'm mad....You have no issues scrolling through the menus on the screen but once you are ready to go into a dance the arrows don't work any longer and you have to figure out if the up arrow is really the square, circle, triangle, or x corner. The combos are a pain too trying to figure out the crypted code, if I still had the packaging and receipt we definately would be returning this.I have to be fair this could possibly be a software issue, we are trying to use this dance mat with the game ""Dance Factory""."
1,this is the worse pad ever made,"this pad is very very cheap....you unzip it and put the foam pad sensors inside and zip it back up....i was running low on cash so i said let me buy it because i didnt feel like wating till next paycheck.....within/less than 2 weeks my back arrow stopped working and i had to slam my foot down on the top ""front"" arrow for it to press down...so plzzz ppl stop being cheap and spend $10 more dollars for a flat konami pad that will not fail you!!!!!"
3,A Little Tip,"If you're really interested in DDR, I wouldn't recommend BUYING a pad, let alone a soft one, even a redoctane. You can BUILD a double pad, just like the arcades, for less than 1/5 of the price of ONE metal pad from any company. The best plans I've found are at: angelfire.com/d20/ddrhomepad. I built one in 3 days, and it works like a charm, no problems, and it works just like the arcade!"
1,Never Used,I did not care for this book at all. It was not student friendly and in a hectic RT program it was not a resource that I used. I found Egans to be a greater help.
4,Okay,"This book was only okay. About the cover models; They are different and I dont like them as well either as some of the other people mentioned. But to lalenalefay, they did mention that Trent was black and never said anything about him having long hair. I dont think the new Conner's as cute as the other one but I don't think he's ugly. Anyway about the book. Alanna and Connor fight and get back together. The usual. Andy tries stand-up comedy again. The only interesting part is the Melissa going after Aaron to make Will and Cherie mad. And that blows up in her face. I had to force myself to get through this book. I hate stories about Alanna so much. The books were so much better when Liz and Conner were together or even when they were apart and Alanna wasn't there. I like the books to focus more on the twins which they don't seem to be doing lately. The only reason I rated this a 4 was because I love the series. I was sorta disappointed in this book but hopefully the next one will be better."
1,Buyer Beware,"Of the 26 songs on this cd 13 are ""new stereo recordings"" - which means, to me at least, that they are virtually worthless. Rerecorded songs include ""Always Something There To Remind Me"", ""Soulful Strut"" and ""You Beat Me To The Punch"". There should be some consistent method to warn prospective buyers about these kind of ""rip-off"" products."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I picked this book up with very high expectations. I ordered the Harcover edition of this book because I thought for sure it was going to be a prized gem in my library. WRONG!!! This has to be the most BORING book I've read in my entire life and I am not one to criticize, but it was just poorly written. She said the same things over and over again such as ""You know children don't take after strangers"", which was cute at first but quickly turned into a nuisance.I was so bored I almost put this book on the shelf without finishing it and I always finish books. I finished the book to see if it was going to get any better. WRONG AGAIN! If I had known it was this bad I would have saved my money and used it towards something better. If you just have to read it, please borrow it from someone or check it out from the libary!!"
2,NOT worth the wait...,"As a fan of Tina McElroy Ansa, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book for at least 2 1/2 years during which time she changed not only the title of the book (It was originally suppose to be titled ""And You Should Know Better"") but also changed publishers. When the book was finally released, I had to have been one of first people in line to buy it and I must say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I did not feel the depth from these charachters that was so easily detected in her past 3 novels, and the story itself simply was not at all intriguing. Though it took Mrs. Ansa several years to follow up her last release, this novel was written as though it took only a few weeks, perhaps due to the fact that she and her husband were working on a screenplay for one of her earlier novels. If you've never read any of T.M. Ansa's work before, PLEASE don't let this novel be the gauge by which you judge her writing ability. I just hope that she is able to redeem herself after this."
3,...And You Know You Know Better!,"After part one of the story, I nearly walked away from it. I adore Ms. Ansa's fascination with the spirit world and I love reading her stories about it. This one for some reason put me off in the beginning. The idea was wonderful. With more and more grandparents raising grandchildren these days the generation gap storyline was one I could appreciate. Parents unable to relate to their children was nothing new, but was well done. The book, however, was too wordy. It took forever for anything of substance to be accomplished, although the car, driving, and ghost motif were more powerful than even the author probably realized. For some reason unknown to me (or hidden in my sub-conscious) this book was a bit frustrating. It didn't always hold my attention and again I think that was due largely to the wordiness and sometimes interminable dialogue. All in all, a good book from a fantastic writer."
3,Not up to her previous standards,"Tina McElroy Ansa's previous three novels are great! This one isn't as good - the characters have less depth and the structure of the novel felt too contrived. However, it does pack an emotional punch. Meanwhile, Ansa's good at sequels. The Hand I Fan With is a great follow-up to Baby of the Family. Who knows, maybe this storyline will go on and get better as it does too? Imagine LaShawndra succeeding where Sandra and Lily failed miserably - not having a baby she doesn't want, not pressuring someone else to do that, and so on..."
3,Confusion,"I am a big fan of Tina's, I have read everything she has written, and passed them on to my daughter and sisters. But, this book was hard to read. I felt like there was to much conversation between the main character and the unseen audience. There was not enough interaction with other significant characters to maintain an interesting flow (for me).First we are riding in the truck with the old dead nurse, and then she was buying bar-b-cue for the old nurse who was deceased, now that threw me. What happen to the the food when the old nurse disappeared. Why did she spend most of the book looking for the lost grandchild. It was an interesting view of her home town.Now don't get me wrong, this woman is a fantastic writer, I would suggest to everyone to read all of her books.Tina, I am sorry to be critical, because I am not a writer, I don't know all the pressure of writing with a dead line. I anxiously await the next book. Because I know you are an awesome writer!"
4,Tina Does it again,"I have read all of Tina's books and she is and extradinary author...."" Better"" was great, however I had to change my mindset early on to see where she was going....I keep waiting for them to find LaShawndra! LOL I enjoyed how each of the deceased individuals mirrored the other characters and help bring them along...."
3,"Not her best, but worth reading","I am in a book club that reads African-American/Third World writers. This novel tells the 24 hour drama of three generations of women family members. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book and laughed out loud at some parts throughout the book. However, this book does repeat itself (character dialoge) that was uninteresting the third time you read it. This may be how people really speak, but it is annoying when reading it over a couple days. For instance, the line ""You know, children don't take after strangers"" is brilliant! But the third time I read it, well, it lost its punch. All in all, I would recommend the book. In particular, all three spirits were exceptional written, I enjoyed the grandmother Lily, didn't 'appreciate' the daughter Sandra and was truly 'scared' of the granddaughter LaShawndra. She is a segment of today's generation that is absolutely every parents nightmare. But she is real! And for that I give Ms. Ansa all the credit."
2,A Complete Waste of Time and Money,"I am a very quick reader when the book is good. But, this book took three months for me to finish. Why? Because it was so long, drawn out and boring. I don't know how many times I had to force myself to finish this book just for the sake of finishing it! The characters were annoying and self centered with the exception of Mama Mama and the three spirits. This is just another remake of the Christmas Carol. Please bypass this book and read ANYTHING else."
4,An eye opener!,"This novel reminds us that in spite of our differences, we must love and respect each other. It also reminds us that we need to talk to our elders and listen to their wisdom. This book will leave you a bit wiser, and so will In-Law Drama and A Guide to the Scriptures. All three books are recommended."
1,BIG disappointment,"I have to agree with Genevieve: this book was terrible. I can't believe it came from the same author who penned ""The Hand I Fan With"" (which I've read no less than three times, it's so good). But I really must comment on the fact that Ms. Ansa doesn't know beans about astrology. It's stated several times throughout the book that LaShawndra was born in June yet she states in her narrative that she's a Scorpio (in reference to reading her horoscope daily). June encompases Gemini and Cancer while Scorpio is late October/early November. Where was the editor? Obviously not editing. So not only does the book suffer, so does the research and editing. Thank heavens I got this book from the library and didn't waste money on it."
1,"Doesn't stay in place, bars slide easily","My husband and I both tried to get this thing to stay in place in our CR-V, but it continued to come loose and would lean. Also, the horizontal bars slide up and down with the slightest touch. My dog learned very quickly that she could simply push on this and she could move it enough to get through/over it. A total waste of money and went in the garbage after just a few weeks. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - go for better quality!"
4,Hair-free seats,"I got the barrier for my new Toyota Rav4. I thought my black lab would enjoy having the big cargo area all to himself but as soon as we left the car, he would be seating in the front seats. It took alittle trial and error to get the right sizing of the barrier to fit the car but it is up and so far so good. The lab tried to fit his head between the seat and the first bar of the barrier but realized he could'nt fit through. He doesn't seem too happy in the back but at least I don't have to walk around with a hairy butt."
3,"Was too tall for my Blazer, but made it fit.",Unit is good quality but it was too tall to fit inside my Blazer. Had to force the bottom pieces into the shaft...and jury rig the unit.
3,decent,"I like the National Geographic Road Trip Atlas better. Its newer, its got nice maps and pictures. But this one is o.k."
1,Not the usual SOG quality,Bought this knife for a friend being deployed to Iraq. Thouight the idea of a knife that blended in with the desert camo uniform would be nice. Good thing I took it out to look at it before wrapping it. Folded it looked okay but when you opened it the blade wiggled back and forth about a sixteen of an inch in each direction. This knife definitely does not live up to the SOG reputation.I presently have 4 different SOG products and all are great. This was a real dissapointment especially with a $65.00 price tag. It went back!
3,Ehhhh........,The package came on time.But the knife is very big and the blade looked dirty...the safety lock felt VERY cheap. If you want a true assisted opening knife then go with the Smith and Wesson M&P!
5,A great system!,"I bought the Quick Fit System several years ago and used the body sculpting disc so much that it wore out and I had to order a replacement recently. I am not currently using the cardio workouts because I am running a lot training for a marathon, but the cardio discs are good. However, I love the sculpting disc! The workouts are quick, none of the 4 is longer than 20 minutes, and effective. The hips, buns and thighs workout will kick your tail. This is a system that men can use and enjoy, as well as women. It will not have you looking like a body builder, but it will get you toned and defined. I highly recommend this system. I am 48 years old and this system has me in the best condition I have been in since my 20's. 6 foot tall, 170 lbs., and size 32 waist. Not to shabby for someone pushing 50. Thanks Gilad!"
5,"Gilad is great, System is great.","This system is very good. It is well rounded, and if you follow it, you will look like Gilad or that lady on the cover (if you want to, if not, use lighter weights). The aerobics are slightly challenging, but easy to follow once you get a hang of the moves. The first cardio is plain old aerobics ""old school style"", nothing crazy. The next two cardio videos remind me of cardio kickbox, but still, the moves are easy to follow and get your heartrate up. Gilad's toning workouts are great, too. You workout your chest and back; shoulders and arms; hips and thighs; and abs. I swear, I used every muscle in my body after going through the whole system. Also, people in his videos are so pleasing to the eye. The men, the women, all of them. The guys are good looking, it made my workout go faster. Men can get a very good workout with this system, too, it's not just for girls."
5,Gilad's Great,"I had not seen Gilad's television show but had a chance to see him while visitng a friend.I am a bit embarressed to admit I did not really know of him either, but I enjoyed what I saw so I decided to pick up his DVD. I was looking for some cardio and other things to expand my workout so I figured it was a good choice. And it was.The workouts are great and Gilad's personality shines. A definate must have for those looking to have cardio in their routines."
2,So so.,"This book is OK, but its not the meat of what your looking for.This book is more based on what not to do then anything else.E.G. ""Don't get into politics or talk about yourself to much, cause girls are more into talking about them selfs.""Lisa Altalida really doesn't tell much of what you need to hear.When I first bought this I thought that ""What better way then to get into a girls head then a girl?"" But thats not the case here.Instead she pretty much offers you on what the average guy knows.Where I'm from there are a lot, and I mean a LOT of girls that are stuck up and think that their candy is way to good for everyone, so instead they get stuck with a dead end job and get knocked up by some trailer trash hick who ends up in prison or becomes a deadbeat drug addict who hangs around all the time.My advise to you is keep looking, something more advanced."
1,It is exactly what it says...,Well this book is exactly what it says. It is an idiot's guide to getting girls.I after reading this book and I felt like I learned almost nothing new. Whole book is extremely linear and counts with best possible situation.I bought this book for $0.1 and I think I got what I paid for.
5,Eat from tree of knowledge!,"This book contains the most sensible and eye-opening answer I have yet encountered to the question, ""Why are there two accounts of the creation of human beings in the book of Genesis?"" Trible argues convincingly that the first account is the story of God's order, and the second account tells of a fallen human order. Her argument is so well-supported by the text that you will never again be able to read the creation story without exclaiming, ""Wow! Phyllis Trible was right!"""
2,Not Impressed.,"In this day and age of delicate screened devices, you need the added protection. I bought this ""single pack"" thinking, Yes, I just want one pack of them. What I didn't realize is there is only one screen protector. For just under $20?? A bit steep for a piece of plastic. I have never been able to get any screen protector on perfect the first time. You need a flub to figure out the quirks. This is overpriced, the protector was too glossy and a bit too thick. The result was awful and there was no backup. Save your money. Had I not ruined it on the install I would have sent it back."
2,too bulky,"i would have expected this to be a little less bulky. but it does the job its intended for, it doesnt make your piercing look like nothing, but it camouflages it enough that employers cant tell if you wear it covered by your hair or something"
2,A balanced story ... presented really badly,"Watching this disk is like reading a really dull high-school level history book or watching a *really* bad stage production. The narrator is as exciting as a mashed-potato sandwich and his script has had all controversy removed from it. The acting/reenactments are between not good and laughable. (As another reviewer commented, Saladin's dialog is so bad you will be rushing for the mute button.) Another down side is that the sound mastering is so bad that it is very difficult to hear the narrator over the fake sounds of battle in many places. On the plus side there are lots of facts and neither the Christians nor the Muslims are portrayed as the ""hero."" If you want a very ""safe"" introduction to the first couple crusades, where the atrocities committed by both sides are mentioned but sterilized, this may be an alright disk for you but there is a LOT to dislike here."
4,Just what I needed,These were the OE plugs for my Mercedes. The local auto shops didn't have them in stock and recommended some with a resistor. After reading a few forum posts I learned these plugs without the resistor are better for the w140.
3,Undrentide,"This CD is the first and only Mediaeval Baebes CD I've heard and was impressed to a certain extent. I read the reviews and noticed that there were people who didn't like some of the more modern instruments. I agree completely, with the acception of the synths! I love synthesizers and always will! I was going to give up on the Baebes since this CD is pretty mediocre, but I read the reviews for their first two CDs and have decided to give them a second chance! I'd say this is a CD to have if you're a die hard Baebes fan, but if you're not, try to get their first two."
3,Not bad,"This album is as pleasant as other Medieval Babes material. However, there are no really catchy tunes on it. Still, it is a pleasant album and always a welcome listen."
2,3rd album NOT the charm,"Oh, Baebes! What were you thinking? Jazzy saxophone riffs? House drumbeats? Synthesizers? Get rid of that producer and bring back the beauty and purity of the Mediaeval Baebes sound! I was captivated by the Baebes previous album ""Worldes Blysse"" from the first and couldn't stop listening to it for months, so my anticipation for ""Undrentide"" was high. Unfortunately, their producer John Cale decided to 'update' the Baebes sound by adding dance backbeats, synthesizers, lush orchestral strings and (19)70s soul music. Yuk! The attraction of the Mediaeval Baebes sound was that it was so different, uncluttered and focusing on vocal harmonies. To be fair, there are some lovely melodies and I like some of the tracks, but too often, musical 'updates'intrude. ""Undrentide"" may be a logical progression for the Baebes, but I want more soulful, simple middle-English song-weaving."
3,Premise seemed promising - ended up contrived,"I liked the idea of the story, but couldn't really ""believe"" any part of the actual book. The saintly maiden is anything but. Additionally, how realistic is it that she found ""God"" from the feeling of fulfillment from intercourse with the brooding Gypsy hero?Additionally, what is with the pool theme? What is with the strip pool game? To have the characters in this book ""invent"" things which are known to have been invented by others is somewhat insulting to those inventors.I did enjoy the author's book, The Rake, so I am hoping that other books by this author are more in line with that book."
2,Was Expecting More,"After reading the reviews and finding this book on so many ""all-time favorite"" lists, I guess I was expecting more out of the story. There were a few too many eye-rolling, slightly cheesy moments for me. Making out in a flooded mine shaft? Sexy harp player? Master bull-whip expert? Really? The book is OK, but not one I really enjoyed."
4,very good,"Grandson likes it. He got two kinds and says he wants alligators too. Maybe he will get more for a birthday. Crocodiles teeth are sharp, very realistic."
3,Nile crocodile,"Small figurine, looks real, ok for play or displaying on a dresser for my grandson who loves wild creatures, looks like image."
2,Xcrement,"The message of this story was great. It was obviously written for at least a high school audience (I can't imagine the message could really be appreciated by anyone younger without explanation) but the reading level is middle school at best, and it reads like a child's fairy tail. I understand that that's the point but that combined with replacing every ""ex"" with an ""X"" makes it torture to get through."
5,This product works exactly as promised. It's convenient ...,This product works exactly as promised. It's convenient and useful. I had no problems with it.
3,A cute book but not very helpful...,"I sort of regret buying this book because it was not very informational for me and I think it's a book intended for younger girls around the ages of 5 and up. I'm 13 and I find this book not helpful enough for teenage girls. There are problems that older kids have to tackle and there are some things in here that just won't help. It's not that easy doing the things that the book suggests. If it would offer more in-depth stuff, I would really enjoy it more.If you want a cute book, go ahead and buy it but I would suggest you find another book if you want real good help and advice."
4,Helpful book,Ideal for ages 8 and up. Helps girls to deal with friendships and difficulties which arise.
1,"If you want it for longevity, don't buy it.","I got this for my birthday and a little over a year later it was useless. The plastic/rubber watch strap just corroded away and broke off. I went to the Nike Store to get a new strap and they said try a sporting goods store. Went to a couple and couldn't find any place that sold replacement straps. I searched the internet high and low and eventually found Parsec Ent. They sent me a strap for $23.95 (rip off) only to find out that it is impossible to replace the strap. A good Nike watch going in the trash, bummer."
2,A Freakish Journey,"I gave this film a rating of two out of five stars. I think the idea of a circus sideshow, complete with grotesque freaks is a terribly wonderful idea. Although there are fewer and fewer traveling circus' displaying freaks these days, the topic is wide open for horror interpretations. I enjoyed a couple of the characters, but thought that overall this film could have been given a little more life with better writing and directing. This film should have had a grittier atmosphere and more gore. For a superior film about traveling circuses, I would recommend Something Wicked This Way Comes. I gave this film two stars out out five, although ti was somewhat closer too a 1.5 on a five star scale. If you can rent it, as for buying it...thats up to you."
1,For God's sake don't see this movie,"What a huge disappointment. I was actually waiting to see this. Fred Olen Ray used to make fun ""bad"" movies where you could at least count on nudity and senseless violence. ""Sideshow"" is a dud, deadly boring and cheaply shot. The ""teen"" characters are so poorly written that staggers the mind. One of the teens appears to be a 35 year old woman. The only decent actor in the film is Dr. Graves, the same actor who did a great job of playing Dracula in ""The Creeps"". I tried to watch this movie with a few other people and they made me turn it off. LAME!"
1,Yuck! Sorry for that 1 star which is a required field...,"Watching this movie is such a waste of time. What a waste of energy, resources and creativity this might have been for those involved in the production of such a terrible film. The cover of the DVD is quite attractive, yet the movie itself is a let-down and the greatest disappointment I've experienced as a movie buff. I agree with the other reviewer that the only worthwhile performance is that of Dr. Graves' and all the actors seemed to have been chosen from amateur bystanders, who mostly were asked to memorize their dialogues, or just be living props! If you plan to while away and waste some of your time, then, you can think of other more creative and more entertaining ways than ""SideShow"" which is more like a home-movie or an extended trailer of film students on probation for a passing mark."
2,Way too expensive,"When bought togeter with the Glassing 101 video,this totals out to $70. Ouch!The methods of shaping presented mimic the same kind of wasteful spending, with expensive (and optional) power tools and an arsenal of obscure equipment presented as almost mandatory. It is of almost no use to the common DIY shaper, who needs only basic and inexpensive tools.It's also kind of cheesy, and the video format means that you better be taking notes if you want to learn anything.I would recommend ""Shaping and Glassing"" by Steven Miller instead because it has probably more information, better diagrams, and costs about 15 bucks."
1,Sky Club,"Boring. Author jumps around too much in relating his story. Hard to keep interested. One loses touch with the main characters, in fact, can't tell who the main characters are."
1,Gas Attack in a Can,Most of the Merrick 5 star varieties seem to go over with my dog. But the Venison Holiday Stew gives him the worst gas... and he never gets gas. Don't buy this unless you hate your dog and have no sense of smell!
2,Not for Outdoor Use,"Nice fountain for indoor use. If you place it outside, the slightest breeze blows the water all over, requiring you to refill the water incessantly. I could see this in a hotel lobby, but not in my backyard. Returning it, disappointed that this product does not come with some warning that it is unrealistic to place it outdoors where there is typical breeze."
2,"Terrible Acoustics, Beautiful Music and Singing","This is by far the worst CD I have ever bought of any CD or record. You could hear the audience coughing and making sounds better in many cases than you could hear the singers. It appears as if the microphones were in the audience and the singers were in the background. It was very annoying to hear all the coughing while trying to enjoy the music and singing. Some arias did not even end; the music just got softer and softer and finally stopped. There was no booklet enclosed and no indication to what opera the arias belonged. The track numbers did not match the CD. The cover showed aria ""Recondita Armonia"" but ""E Lucevan Le Stelle"" was actually sung. At least they got the opera correct, ""Tosca"". If not for the great and beautiful voices of all the singers male and female I wouldn't even give this CD a two-star rating."
5,Amazing!!!!,Truly a gem!! One of the most fresh and best listening albums I have head in years!So impressed. This album got me excied about music again and inspired to find more like this (good luck!). Can't wait for Lizzies next album but if it is 1/10 as good as this it will still be great.
5,Gasp! Gasp! I'm still breathless after reading it!,"An inner core of steel helps Laura Hoge Wood overcome a childhood fraught with great hardship and danger and takes her to the very portals of history and the U.S. presidency. A woman as uniquely Texan as her environment, Laura has to make an early decision between following her heart or her head in matters of love. That decision shows the mettle which serves Laura well for the rest of her long life. Her pioneer spirit brings her through adventures not for the faint of heart. This book has everything- suspense, romance, mystery, history- that will satisfy even the tastes of a picky reader."
5,INCREDIBLE! MY NEW FAVORITE. A GREAT BOOK.,"I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. From the beginning to the ""wow"" of an ending this book will have you hooked. A truely fantastic read. Laura (the main character ) is a very likeable child who grows into a remarkable woman. Her lifes journy takes the reader on a wonderful adventure. Along with her growth as a person the reader can't help but to grow also. A fantastic story."
3,Question on Lucy,"I am almost finished with Hill Country. There is a question, that I think I found the answer to about Lucy, Laura's sister. When Laura was bitten by the wild dogs on the night of Haleys comet, and Laura was transported by Lucy's car, how did Lucy die? It is brought to the readers attention that Lucy died, with no explaination given of how. Was there a car wreck? Would someone please show me what I missed with Lucy's death?"
5,Surprised to find this is my family,"Another book by Janice Woods Windle, she wrote True Women and just by accident my sister saw it. There on the fist page were pictures of our great grandparents. Wonderful books. All the old family stories we had heard growing up were the same stories in the book. It was nice to learn it wasn't all folklore. Great books, if you enjoy reading historical novels, you are in for a nice surprise.Rita McWhorter"
3,Two Books,"Ms Windle has given us two books in one. A thoroughly delightful sequel to ""True Women"" in Laura Woods and a thoroughly boring (even to a Texan who lived through it) story of Lyndon Johnson.Too bad they were not bound seperately so I could have only read the one about Laura Woods."
2,Star Split,"This book was especially dense and dull for a YA offering. Where there was talk about rock climbing and assisted reproductive technology, there could have been characterization and world building. The author spent too much time focused on the evils of designer babies, instead of telling a compelling story. The writing itself was okay, too bad it didn't say much."
2,What?? I dont get it!!,Oh wow!! This book was assigned to me by my fifth grade teacher.When I started to read this i thought hey!! This sounds good so I read it and as soon as I got to the end wow the charecters coming to fast I dont even know what a chimera was and also what in the name of pearl is an umbulae??Now we have to write a book report.Thank you all for writing reviews because now I understand it. Because I read 10 reviews online and printed 5!!
4,"""Star"" Search","STAR SPLIT was an interesting mix of science and story. Set over one thousand years in the future, this book finds the world's people not too far removed from our own 21st century folks - there are no aliens, no robots, no Jetsons-esque contraptions - except for the long strides made with human cloning, chromosome research and other genetic enhancements. Those with bonus DNA and cultivated strengths are ""Genhaunts,"" and in an elevated position with regards to the ""Originals."" One young girl discovers there is more to her family's personal history and to the process and progress of society. A good book for young readers interested in science or those wondering how cloning could happen."
5,Makes my dry hair manageable,"I have searched for a product like this for a long, long time! I read somewhere that this is what Jennifer Lopez uses so I decided to give it a try and it really helps keep my hair healthy. I tend to have dry ends due to using a straightening iron and highlighting every 6 weeks. This product makes my hair shiny with no oily build-up like with some products. Highly recommended!"
5,Powerful and Virile,"I grew up listening to the Concertgebouw on Phillips 10 inch records performing Wagner, Weber and other mittel-Europa composers. This performance is stunning and moving, even to someone who has heard this many times. For someone who has never heard the 9th, it would astound them. There is one very minor thing, not a flaw. At the start of some of the cuts one can hear the orchestra shuffling in their seats, and ocassionaly the conductor's baton smacks the podium. That just adds to the veracity that 'you are there'. The Water Goblin was unfamiliar but just as powerful."
1,REALLY ANNOYING,"The sleeve is really pretty and it looked good, but what was called by one reviewer as a sweet voice, is really just this annoying high pitched, i don't know. Really cheesy this album. i was disappointed."
2,Goblin Schlock,"If you are buying this because you love Rob, be aware this is the Rob wearing his Goblin Cock hat. If you aren't familiar with this incarnation...let's just say it ain't the Rob of Pinback or Heavy Vegetable fame. Same guy, different sensitivity.I fell in love with Rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there. On this outing, Rob has met the enemy and it is himself. He's entitled to do as he pleases and you and I are entitled to not care for it. This CD is not an acquired taste, it is a forced-feeding."
4,So far so good,"I originally bought a Furminator but it got lost in the mail and I really didn't want to spend another $30 to get another one. I saw this brush in a local store for a quarter of the price so I thought that I would give it a try since it was so cheap. If it didn't work, not a big deal right? I've only used it once but it seems to pull large quantities of hair off of my shedding labradoodle. I got a small shopping bag full in about 30 minutes. I've never actually used the Furminator so I can't compare but I think this product is a great bang for your buck."
2,inconvenient. get the furminator instead,"i got this for my cat (ocicat breed). he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes. shedender worked just like the commericals. one brush and fur goes flying everywhere. it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back. as u can see in the picture the tool is small. if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool. if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead. i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price."
3,Interesting premise,"I certainly was intrigued by the premise of a best friend carrying her friends baby. Then after crashing into their house and becoming comatose, there are secrets that get revealed. I thought the study of the friendship between Darla and Joanne was extremly thorough and well developed. But, I didn't feel that was the case with Darla's supposedly desperate feelings about becoming a mother. Those feelings are only touched on briefly, are not prevalent throughout the book, and therefore, her approval of the unorthadox conception didn't completely ring true for me. However, I think that this book showed the grief felt by Darla losing her best friend, better than almost any book I've ever read on the subject. The author did not tie that grief up in a neat bow, but showed how the crushing loss of someone you love is something that is struggled with for a very long time."
3,Compelling story sure to spark debate,"Darla and Cal Stevens have given up on conceiving a child. When her best friend Joanne agrees to be a surrogate, Darla gives the okay to do it the old fashioned way. Five months later, a teary eyed Joanne flees the Stevens household, only to come crashing through the bedroom a few hours later, leaving her brain dead, but able to carry the child.Joanne's accident unearths many lies and long-buried secrets, and results in a grueling custody battle between Darla and Cal and Joanne's estranged parents. With Cal acting distant and unsure if they should pursue keeping the child, Darla is forced to turn to an old mutual friend of her and Joanne who is now a priest for answers. But is she ready to uncover the truth?Page tells a compelling story with a moral center that will keep readers debating until the end, despite a pretty selfish protagonist who'll do anything to be a mother."
1,Struggled to finish this one,"I can easily see this novel being turned into a sappy Lifetime channel movie, replete with melodramatic music. I was surprised to see other reviews with 4 stars; I definitely was glad to reach the end of this tedious, flat novel."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible",Do not waste your money on this rubbish. It was poorly written and uninformative. There are at least 4 general introductory books about wines that are far superior.
3,Be sure you're getting the right edition!,"The Kindle version of this book is the 1st edition, not the newer 2nd edition. I paid $45 for this book and can't use it in my class, since the newer edition has a lot more content than the 1999 edition. Apparently there is no Kindle version of the 2nd edition. However, the page for the 2nd edition of this book links to the Kindle version of the 1st edition without noting that they are not the same edition. The covers differ but I did not notice in time. The book may be good but it is the wrong one for my class."
1,Wrong Kindle Edition,I ordered this book for my Kindle for a class I'm taking. A week into the class I realized that the book on my Kindle is the 1st edition not the 2nd which I needed. If you are looking for the 2nd edition DO NOT order it for your Kindle. I now have to pay for one day shipping so I can get my assignments completed
4,helpful book,"One of the better books on career counseling. Theories are presented, and greatly enhanced by in-depth application of theory to case studies."
1,Unforgivable cut,"While these other reviewers are falling all over themselves commending this video of Trouble in Tahiti, I wonder if any of them realize that an ENTIRE DUET has been cut!! It comes after the ""Why did I have to lie"" scene when Sam Dinah accidentally run into each other on the street. This is unforgivable in such a short work. It's a beautiful duet, one of Bernstein's most lyric creations and it alludes to the garden of Dinah's dream in the analyst scene. What were they thinking??? What a disappointment!!"
1,"Talk about ""trouble""...","As noted in another review here, there's an inexplicable cut in the middle of this, excising the heart right out of the piece. But the horrifically flat singing of the man in the role of Sam shouldn't pass without mention here either. ""Trouble in Tahiti"" is a wonderful work, as accessible as anything Bernstein ever wrote. It's a shame to think that this musically butchered, operatically ""acted,"" poorly-sung production might be someone's first (and probably last) exposure to the piece."
1,Access codes,I had the hardest time getting the access code reset. aparently this book is no longer in production and the access codes expired 12/31/11.
1,Online Code didn't work!,I bought what I thought was a new book. When it came I tired doing the online exercise with Person Vue and the code on the inside of the book wouldn't work. I called Person Vue and they said the code had already been used and that I had to call who ever I bought the book from. I called and was told I had to buy a new book! What a ripoff!
2,Not What I Expected,"I understood that this came with a four foot cable, yet it measures just over three. When plugged in to my camcorder, it triggers the camcorder's mute feature, thus making sound recording impossible. So far I'm not impressed."
1,Useless,"I needed an inexpensive mic to improve the audio of some videos I was creating for a public speaking project. I took a chance on this inexpensive mic, thinking anything would be an improvement over my Canon camcorder's built-in mic. Unfortunately, the mic was DOA. It didn't work with the camcorder, my laptop or any other device I plugged it into.I returned it to Amazon and received a quick refund. Stay away from this mic."
4,Rewarding,"I bought this book in hardcover when it appeared and I am glad to see that it has won some admirers among its many critics. I thought it was an interesting memoir even apart from the special focus on bodybuilding, the story of his youth, family, and departure from the mid-west was convincing and to me, absorbing. It is indeed well written and moves smoothly from chapter to chapter, and I do not share the views of those who found it self-pitying; rather it seems an honest attempt by a man with a very unusual career to come to terms with his own life. It made me like him and wish him well. Why criticize him for not writing the book you ""expected""?"
2,Beware: This book is not what you think!,"I will keep this brief and to the point. This book spends a ton of time talking about Bob Paris' difficult life growing up with parents twice divorced and his own battle to defeat his inner demons. The bodybuilding aspect of this book isn't nearly as featured throughout the book as you would suspect from the title and isn't revealed through this book. Therefore, in terms of a story of a troubled young man that turns his life around into something successful and meaningful it is an average book; in terms of a book providing inside insight on Bodybuilding ... you may want to look elsewhere."
3,An autobio rather than Adventures in BB,"I have to admit I was dissapointed in this book. The book in and of itself is fine, but it was more of a life story of Bob Paris. As it was subtitled 'My Adventures in Bodybuilding' I expected more insights into that world. (And actually, I remember reading articles by Paris in BB magazines in the 80's in which there were probably more insight than there are in this book.) Having grown up around the Weider mags at that time, I was actually looking for first hand experiences of how it all operated.So if you are looking for an analysis of someone's life in this area, this book is probably not it. However, as a biography of Bob Paris the book is fine."
2,He's a bodybuilder; not a gay man,"The book was enjoyable and easy reading. But was definately not what I expected. He touches on being a gay man in about five pages in the whole book. I was much more interested in his experience as a gay man who was in the sport of bodybuilding then a bodybuilder who happens to be a gay man. If you are someone who wants to know what its like to be a professional bodybuilder, regardless of sexuality, then I'd give this book a 7. He speaks honestly about his opinions and the realities of the bodybuilding profession (drugs, Joe Weider's meglomania)."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but interesting none-the-less","I read the entire thing in one sitting. I have to admit that I was wondering if he was going to mention the fact that he's gay, but when he finally did, and went on, I was disappointed.I admit I knew nothing about the guy except that he was gay and a bodybuilder. I spent most of the book thinking, ""wow, someone thinks mighty high of themselves don't they"". His preoccupation with stardom and himself really was a turnoff. It wasn't until the last several dozen pages when he took a stand against Weider that I found him even likable.I'm glad I didn't pay more for it."
2,The Gorilla Suit is Really a Mask,"GORILLA SUIT is the third book by Mr. Paris that I've read and it was strike three, he's out. While he is looked upon by some as a spokesperson for the gay community, I am not among his admirers. I had a tough time with this book and thought he was really searching for sympathy over the breakup of his relationship and his current place in the world. There is a serious ""pity me"" quality to the writing here which is unacceptable from such a respected man.Having met Mr. Paris and his then-spouse, Mr. Jackson and hearing them speak at a gay event in Minneapolis several years ago, both my friend and I were put off by his coldness and somewhat rude attitude. Mr. Jackson was much nicer and far more outgoing. It was evident that he was the warmer of the two, and he wasn't going to take a back seat to his more famous lover.Read GORILLA SUIT at your own peril, but frankly, there are better books about this topic..."
3,"Intresting read, not tecnical about bodybuilding","As my title suggests, this book is a life story rather than a training manual. For some people it can be a curse, for some a blessing. Anyway, it is an intresting read and to my opinion, Paris writes quite well..He is somewhat whiny in his writings, but still manages to make the story intresting. Another reader remarked that it is not truthfull about the drugs but in my opinion it is, compared to the many other books in the market!"
3,this was not the book i was expecting to read.,"Being a gay bodybuilder and into a sport where there is a lot of explotation and all around craziness,I was epecting this book to be a real page turner.A great deal of the book tells of Bob's childhood and troubled adolescence.I wanted to skim ahead to the ""juicy stuff"".I decided to be patient.The juicy sruff never arrived.I've read other accounts of the bodybuilding lifestlye and this was the dullest.I'm sure Bob left some stories out to protect the innocent.Even the gay issue wasn't really explored.While I admit Bob had me turning the pages with anticipation,I kept wishing he'd get ot the point.I found his growing up years touching and disturbing,and when the book was over,it was indeed as if Bob Paris had told me his story personally,but it wasn't the story I was expecting to hear."
5,Very important spiritual tool,"This is one of the tools Kabbalah offers us, each of the 72 names is for a specific purpose. You meditate on the name or names (one at a time) that you feel you need, in the way the book explains. The names cannot be pronounced, as they are not words, but combinations of letters, so they really don't have a meaning, but each combination of letters has a diferent energy that helps us in the way that is described in each of the meditations!!! If you want to say any specific name you say the letters, for example Mem Hey Shin, which is the name for healing. The meditations are beautiful, very wise words by Yehuda Berg, that touch your heart and your soul!!!You can also scan the chart with the 72 names of God, in the way that is described in the book, once or twice a day."
5,Makes meditation easy,This book doesn't need an explanation. The power of the letters in this books is overwhelming. It is merely enough to look at the letters to receive the effect.
3,72 Names of God,I have done much study and this book was just OK. I would not purchase it again. It might be good for some. I felt that much more could have been offered by the author which he did not disclose. Sad to me.
4,Quality product,"This is a great product - however it is overkill for a tube or a large tube, even a 3 person tube. This is really made for pulling one of those multi-person banana boats or a 4 person tube ( 600lbs+). The product is easy to see in the water and seems to be made well, however, it does fray easily when it comes in contact with any type of rough edged object on a boat."
4,product,recieved this in timely fashion and an airbubbled cardboard box it is as it said when I use it Im confendent Ill be able to give it 5 stars
3,Pressure cooker fuse,"Never did get the right fuse from Goodman's.Returns were credited, but I really wanted the right fuse."
3,S-9888 metal safety fuse,"This purchase got my Mirro pressure cooker back into operation. The $8.97 price tag seemed a bit high for such a small piece of metal, but it was less than a replacement for the entire unit. This new safety fuse, however, has increased the time and changed the once normal way of cooking. Because it now takes longer for reaching the pressure zone, one must take care not to use full heat to get there, or one risks turning portions of the content black."
1,This is Newsboys?!,"It's a real shame. I've loved every album Newsboys had come out with before this one (that I had heard) but when I heard they were making a worship album I was skeptical.My mom bought me the CD so I thought I'd give it a fair llistening. Needless to say it was ok worship music but not a good Newsboys CD. ""He Reigns"" is a pretty good song and so is ""Take These Hands"" but I can't sit down and listen to this whole album without getting really tired or bored.Even worse, two of the tracks are just live versions of the two worst songs on ""Thrive"". So half the lyrics in here they didn't write and two whole songs aren't even new songs. Not a lot of work was put into this album at all.Where did the Newboys that gave Christian music a good name go?! I want to hear more stuff like ""Take Me To Your Leader"" and ""Step Up To The Microphone""!I really think it deserves 1.5 but that isn't an option and it doesn't get a 2!"
4,Worship with a twist,Great work just a little short on songs. In true Newsboys fashion the songs are well done. He Reigns is now one of my all time favorite songs. The live cuts on the CD are really good as well. This is not your typical praise album but rather Newsboys orginals and Newsboys takes on some other praise songs with each song being unique.
2,USB6,"This DVD has the required amount of flashing on the beaches and indoor areas, nothing real outstanding.It has one girl doing a solo job and getting herself off which was pretty damned good. The play time was only 46 minutes which allows you to feel that youv'e been had."
3,Average,Yes this video is about average for GGW. Lots of average or worse looking girls and a couple semi-hot ones. Nothing special here.
3,"A landmark, that's it.","As the title of the series suggests, this is another ""landmark"" in books of mathematics. In fact, this was the only book on homological algebra for a certain period of time. I don't think this is a fungus, but with other modern good textbooks available (Weibel, for example) I am not inclined to give it ""five stars""."
5,Good product,"I use pantothenic acid daily. Among other things, it helps me relax for sleep. I have no way of knowing if this brand is better than others, however."
3,I dont know what to say,I'm not sure how to rate a supplement that you aren't sure what it does specifically. I ordered a lot of supplements for my perioral dermatitis and it seems to be getting better but not sure which one or if all are responsible.
2,The Length of Delivery Ruined it for Me,"I'm sure that the book is filled with fantastic diagrams, but I wouldn't know because I have yet to receive it. It shipped on September 23rd and it is now October 7th and it's yet to arrive. I have ordered several items since then and they all arrived promptly, but this was the only one that I really cared about and it hasn't shown up yet. I'll right a better review and give it a higher rating if it ever arrives, but I really think that 'Express Books' needs to change their name to 'Books that Ship Whenever We Feel Like Sending Them.'"
3,One Trick Pony,"I would file this right next to Donald Byrd's 1960 ""Byrd In Flight"" and Lou Donaldson's 1958 ""Blues Walk"" as solid yet unspectacular 2nd tier hard-bop albums. The playing is fairly standard for the era, and strays very little from the formula. Granted, this recording was made 10+ years after McGhee's famous heyday, so maybe it should be judged on an appropriately lesser scale. There's not much wrong with it, except for the fact that very little of it stands out as memorable. Okay for a beginner, but a bit stale for the initiated.For better hard bop of the same period, might I suggest Kenny Dorham's 1961 ""Whistlestop"" or Blue Mitchell's 1960 ""Blue's Moods."" And how could we forget Lee Morgan's brilliant 1963 ""The Sidewinder.""McGhee is best heard in his prime late 1940's material. And if that era is your cup of tea, you shouldn't miss Fats Navarro's contributions in the same time-frame."
2,NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE,"About eight years ago I bought a DVD collection from a publc domain company calledBuyer's Gallery out of Canada. They sold their silent Tarzan films in three separate sets each .The quality of the original sets I bought were quite good but I was hoping that with this one, seeing the packaging was so well produced, that the product inside might be better as well. After the watching the set it did not take long to realize frame per frame ""IT'S THE SAME FILMS"". It's obvious where it was ripped from.The same can be said for The Adventures of Tarzan Series 1921 and their Elmo Lincolns which I also bought and feel cheated on. Identical to my original Buyer's Gallery versions, right down to the flaws and editsNeedless to say I'm beyond disappointed. But being puiblic domain footage I guess that there's nothing stopping them from taking another company's work.Maybe someone will come along one day and really do these films justice"
3,"Something good, something bad.","This film was better than I expected in some ways, and worse in other ways. The emotional direction of the actors was pretty bad, with melodramatic eye-rolling expressions. And the serial wasn't as interesting after the heroine stopped wearing her scanty jungle outfit. But I was very impressed with the ease at which the hero got on and off the elephant, and the way he would occasionally stand and ride the elephant like a surfboard. One of the cliffhangers was particularly good: (SPOILER ALERT) the hero and heroine are making out in the jungle, a native throws a spear at the hero's back, and he falls to the ground, motionless. I've seen a lot of serial cliffhangers, but never one where the hero was kissing while attacked like that."
4,Boy,"Kamuela Searle was my great-grand uncle so, of course, I wanted to see his movie. As a result' I was disappointed that there wasn't more of him to see in the movie. I laughed thru many scenes but I thought the overall storywas good but the picture quality and text editing wasn't that great."
4,Britney Karaoke Review,"Now if you are not a fan of karaoke I would not recommend this but if you simply love karaoke and you just wanna dance for the simple fun of it even though it is silly and people are looking at you like your nuts but I wouldn't care, dance on. This contains Baby One More Time, Sometimes, and other favorites. I'm not disappointed, I just love it, and I'm sure that you will too!"
4,Great article in NY Times,The Science section for 5/10/05 had a great review and discussion of this book and its concepts. Made me order toot sweet.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30814FA39540C738DDDAC0894DD404482&incamp;=archive:searchDPS/Seattle
5,First class reportage - A fascinating story well told.,"I only recently came across the evidence of Ryszard Kapuscinski's alleged double life. But putting such allegations aside, and the political taint on both sides of same, I have to say this is an excellent book. The author never made any claim to purist journalism - I recall his own descriptive term was ""literary journalism"", so griping about clinical accuracy is to miss the point. If you enjoyed the outstanding and often lyrical war reportage of Alan Moorehead's African Trilogy, and also Michael Herr's Dispatches, then you will love The Emperor (and also The Shadow of the Sun). Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointing,"This book was writen in an engrossing and facinating style. However, the level of blatant exageration and even falsehood (the author would have us believe that the ministers of the Ethiopian Empire were jumping out from behind trees to talk to the monarch) is a waste of a great opportunity to document one of the more remarkable reigns of the 20th century. The fact that most of those people that Mr. Kapuscinski claims contributed to his book are deeply offended by it should be enough of a commentary on this work."
1,"Another Slanderous Work, but thank you.",one must be of a purity in hatred to write and publish such exaggerations and side-swipes towards a Great Leader. I am willing to purchase this book and read it only to utilize it as an example of propaganda which is important in revealing that true Might will entice the devil's deeds.
5,The secret is out,Kapuscinski is one of the best at this type of writing...and perhaps THE best writer on Africa in general. The Emperor is easy to read and will not bog you down with page after page of boring political details.This is my favorite Kapuscinski book. The style is totally unique and the people of Ethopia will owe the author a debt of gratitude for recording the history held within. For example.....the author found and interviewed the only person (his butler/servant) to be with the Emperor during the last weeks of his reign. He found the servant in hiding and he must have been very old.Through a series of interviews with the palace staff....the writer paints a complete picture of what the Emporer was like and what it was like for the dignitaries and servants that had to compete for his favor. I didn't realize the quality of what I had read until I completed the book and then I continued to reflect on it for weeks.I wish I could give the book 6 stars.
5,A Rare Insiders Look,A series of spellbinding interviews of palace insiders that collectively defines the genius and folly of Haille Selassie's 45-year autocratic rule of Ethiopia
2,Hugely Disappointing...,"The format of the book itself is wrong ( to me). Instead of being a biography of the Emperor, it is a collection of accounts of his former employees; stake-holders of his (mis)rule. The very men who implemented his bizarre orders with promptness and enthusiasm. So the good writer doctored the eye-witness accounts with an ironical (satirical) air. It ultimately fails to lift the narrative. In fact, stalls the narrative with sameness. There is no single individual voice in the narrative.I am not giving it 1 star because it does give you lot of information, but the style is dull and painfully so. The subject matter is rich, though...AVOID!!!!"
5,a great book!,"Kapuscinski's book gives the genuine feeling of the author's knowledge, sensitivity for truth and objectivity in showing the subject. It is a very special and very moving book. Kapuscinsk's writing leaves the reader with a great appreciation for his talent to bring such special understanding for that part of world that is somehow not so much known. His book is one of the best I have read recently."
4,Past her Prime but fabulous !,"At this point in Miss Washington's career, she seemed bored and her gifts had been diminished by alcohol.But when I was a kid listening to my Father's record collection, I played this album to death! To this day it's one of my all time faves.Drinking Again,Destination Moon,Is you is or is you aint my baby,Where are you, are all stand outs and can be shiver inducing. "" Where are you "" has actually brought me to tears. The bombastic big band arrangements mixed with a vague knod to rock guitar ( thanks Elvis )show a transition in the pop/jazz industry. One was on the way in and the other was on it's last legs.Long Live Dinah !Doug CashMusician / Producer"
4,Scriptural Based Way of The Cross,"Fr. Champlin has taken an innovation by Pope John Paul II and made it accessible to the devotion of those who walk the Way of The Cross in Lent. Basing each Station of The Cross on the passage from Scripture that covers the entire Passion and not just beginning at the condemnation and ending at the entombment this work takes on the character of ""Lectio Divina"". We are called to enter into the Scriptural passage and meditate on its implications for us."
3,Would be better in Mono,"Unfortunately, they attempted to turn the original mono recordings into stereo. The end result is terrible. It sounds like they added stereo simply by panning from the left to right channel occasionally, which is a very annoying effect if you are wearing headphones. It sounds like they also (unsuccessfully) tried to add some ""depth"" to the sound. I have heard other versions of some of these tunes in mono with a much ""brighter"" sound quality, and it sounded a lot better.It's a shame, because it really is a great collection of tunes."
1,don't waste money,"this dvd is a piece of garbage. every scence was grainy, you couldn't see anything. the lighting was horrible. and they had some over lay lousy music. what a piece of crap. please don't buy this. it's a rip off."
5,What's inside,"The book is a collection of every fact you would ever want to know about Chicago, split up into 20+ categories such as ""Academics"", ""On-Campus Dining,"" ""Night Life"", ""Off-Campus Housing"" et cetera.Along with all the important facts (in ""Off-Campus Dining"" the section includles the names, addresses, and a brief description of nearly every restaurant in Hyde Park), there are also quotes from current and former students, and then one page of commentary by the author, followed by a letter grade given by the author (a student at Chicago) and the editor.Full disclosure: I'm the author. And while I'd love for you to simply buy the book, I'd rather you know exactly what it is you'll be getting so that you can make an informed decision."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I read the other two reviews and thought this would be a good CD. The recording does not sound like a full orchestra. Instead it has a cheesy electronic sound to it.
3,Curate's egg,"In a famous Victorian joke, a curate was asked how his egg was, and he answered, ""Good--in parts,"" and that's the case with this performance. Della Casa, Jurinac, and Kunz are fine, and it's always a joy to hear Della Casa in Strauss--but Gueden, who was having a bad night, makes some truly awful noises. The sound quality is fairly iffy, too. So this is an interesting record of Della Casa singing the Marschallin, but otherwise expendable."
1,From Gold Box to Garbage Dumpster in 90 Days,"This was easily the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I was enticed by the cheap Gold Box price on this feather bed, and against my better judgement I made the purchase. Everything the other reviewers say is true. The quills on the feathers push through the covers and poke you at night. The bed constantly pukes feathers out onto the bed and the floor. The worst part for me occurred after 90 days of use -- I started to get the sensation that bugs were crawling over me and biting me at night. I quickly realized that the feather bed was so poorly constructed that it became a home for bugs. This was absolutely disgusting and I threw it in the garbage immediately after that discovery. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for selling this piece of crap to consumers -- we should all be given refunds and the item removed from Amazon's web site."
1,WORSE than a bed of nails,I also bought this before any reviews. It was put on a spare bed which I had the unfortunate experience of having to sleep on recently. I feel so bad for any of my guests who had to endure this topper. It was like a torture chamber and I had a thick mattress pad on top.
1,Not too good to be true.,I got what I paid for. You wouldn't be overwhelmed by the bargain. Still I was happy to find a mattress cover for a full bed at this price.
1,POS,"Agree with everything others say here.I threw my other mattress topper away thinking this would be a logical and nice replacement. Now I have to go buy another one and spend even more money. It said this thing is made in the USA, although at this quality, I'm highly skeptical it wasn't made in Chinese sweatshop and just relabeled here for a quick sale."
1,feather bed,"This is horrible. I was so excited to have the feather bed that I put it on my bed right after if was delivered. What a mistake. My husband and I both had a terrible night's sleep getting constantly poked by the feather tips that stick out through the material. They are so large that they poked through the feather bed cover, another light mattress pad AND my sheets. Ouch!!! and don't buy this! Spend the money and buy one with higher quality, smaller feathers."
4,NOT NECESSARILY UNHAPPY,"I have a very old mattress and was not in a position to buy a new one at this time so the feather bed was to be an intermediate solution. For comfort, I give it the best review possible. The biggest problem, and it is a big one for me, is that the feathers poke through the cover. They actually hurt sometimes. I wish there were some way to fix this because I would give it a definite 5 out of 5 for comfort. All in all I am still happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
4,Ouch!,This is a great product at a great price. Only drawback is that the quills of the feathers stick through the outer shell and stick into your body. We have had this product for about 45 days and for the most part the quills have worked their way out. This problem could also be remedied by putting an extra sheet over product.
4,"My at home ""Heavenly Bed""","I love this featherbed. I wish it had instructions, though: Do I put it on top or under my mattress pad? Other than that, I LOVE IT. It feels like I'm at the ""W"" hotel every night!"
3,Decent featherbed,"I also jumped on this deal but for some reason did not have the horrid experience as other buyers. The one I received is a decent feathered, flatter than the picture indicates, but provides a good 1-inch of feather product above the mattress. Feeling around the product I did notice that there was potential to be poked, but after laying it underneath my 230 thread count sheet I didn't feel any sharp poking. I even tried to be poked by moving all around and it didn't happen. The product is surely a hit or miss but it made my bed just a little kushier to sleep on."
1,Yikes! A hokey POKEY feather bed!,"looked good... but the feathers are constantly poking you, even through the flannel sheet! I'm going to cover it with a mattress pad and then the sheet and hopeully that will correct the problem."
3,"Ok, if you don't mind feathers poking you!","The picture makes the bed look fuller than it really is. Keep in mind the thread count: it won't keep feathers from poking poking out and stabbing you. I'd suggest getting a sheet with a very high thread count, but I'm not absolutely sure that would work either. My first sleep (3 hours) was quite comfortable."
1,Horrendous,Avoid at all costs. I think the other reviewers have said it very well. It would be more comfortable to toss and turn on a bed of rusty nails. I was totally hoodwinked by the price. Save yourself the time and money.
1,DO NOT BUY!,When I bought mine there was no reviews. I have the same problems as the other reviewers have. Feathers poking through. I was suckered by the low price. Stay far away from this product.
1,Pin cushion....,Within 2 nights we were pulling feathers out that had come up from this feather bed thru our sheets. Returned as fast as I could.
1,Thought it sounded too good to be true.,"Sadly, I was right. I have a 1/2 thick memory foam mattress topper that had seen better days. So when I saw this ""deal,"" I jumped right on it. Problem, though- when I jumped right on this ""feather bed,"" I immediately felt a sharp pain in my side. Yup- still fully clothed, they stabbed right through the cover, my sheets, and my tee shirt with no problem. I ended up putting it under my memory foam mattress topper and at first it was really nice. But now I'm having back problems when I wake up in the morning, and this thing is being tossed. I'd donate it to charity, but giving this to a homeless person would be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Lesson learned!! If it seems like an awesome deal, be wary."
1,accupuncture while you sleep!,This was the most wasted $39.99 I ever spent. Endless poking of feathers. It's like having accupuncture while you sleep! Now I don't know what to do with it because if I give it to a friend they will get mad at me.
1,not worth even 1 star. minus 5 would be better,"don't even think of adding mattress pads. i did and after 2 weeks the feathers even came through memory foam. there were no reviews when i purchased the nail bed. can't believe amazon is still selling it. i returned mine yesterday. had to stand in line at the post office with the large heavy box of what weighed like nails, not feathers. wonder why they would even want it back. hope they don't have a sale on all the returned ones. i feel for anyone that purchased one."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this on sale, thank God. I never could get it to ""fluff up"" like it looks in the picture and the feathers! Those damn feathers were everywhere! It wasn't comfortable and since they used cheap feathers, they crackled every time I moved. I finally gave up and gave it away. I'm still pulling feathers out of my mattress."
1,what a waste of MONEY,"a worthless item. Feathers everywhere, poking you at night. It ruined a $100 mattress pad and took hours to hand pull the feathers from the mattress. All this after 2 nights using it."
1,Ouch!,"This made my bed really uncomfortable - feathers poking out even with a mattress cover and sheet over the feather bed. It's now OFF my bed and I'm still finding feathers. Use the $40 you would spend on this product and buy a memory foam mattress cover instead. It's much better.Don't buy this - it's a real disappointment. If I could post this as 0 stars, I would, but it won't let me do that."
1,"""Conditioning for sleeping on a bed of nails...""","Yes, if one plans on the above, go for it, buy this feather bed...but if you want to sleep at night I suggest you Run, don't walk, away from this product. How anyone could produce & market such a faulty item is beyond me...but then again I was one of the suckers that let the Gold Box price sell me...how does that old adage go ""If it seems to good to be true...."""
1,Not the Gooses that Laid the Golden Egg,"Like the other two people who already commented, my Blue Ridge 2"" Baffle Box Feather Bed (Queen Size) looks good and is nicely priced (I purchased it as an Amazon 'Deal of the Day' item), but unless you enjoy feathers poking you all over, you should avoid this product at any cost. I have two sheets, one flannel, covering the product, and I am still being uncomfortably poked."
1,Worst Purchase Ever!,"It's almost criminal to pass this off as a great discount. Not am I losing the money I spent on the feather bed, but I've had to spend hours getting the prickly loose feathers out of mattress and other bedding. If there was a rating lower than 1 star, that's what it would get."
5,Buttermilk rating the Fly,"Read it this winter break and it was well worth my time. I picked the book up with the intent of reading a few pages and was just sucked in. It informed me a ""white boy"" from the burbs on life from a different perspective. The book showcases classic and award winning graphic design projects. Also has plenty of motivational ammunition for YOU to do good and succeed in life and in graphic design.I say two thumbs up."
2,Be careful,"Volume 3 contains 6 episodes that are also on Volume 2, so if you purchase Volume 2 you will also have Volume 3. It is not presented that way however. I ended up giving Volume 3 to a friend but I still felt ripped off because I bought the same thing twice, which I feel is irresponsible of Amazon. I wonder how many others this has happened to."
4,Live the Dream!,"Great film. Dialog is so important to a good movie and this one is full of thought provoking conversations. Well developed characters, exciting plot, and superbly directed. Must see!"
1,disappointed,"I was just reading the DVD review about ""Shirley Temple- Early Years Collection"" and I am convinced the critic is just tailored for this DVD too. I believe that both DVD's are strictly the same. So, I completely agree with my colleague writing about this alternate DVD ""S.Temple- Early Years"". DON'T BUY THIS ONE TOO!!!"
3,no easy way,"the best way to get abs is to diet and do situps, start with a little than buildup hitting all areas of the stomach. this book provides you with the exercises to do as do all of them but the key is the diet. if your looking for a guide to learn what situps to do than i'll recommend but if you alredy know about what situps to do than you'll just be reading what you already know."
3,Shiny,"It's very pretty, the stones are bright, the metal is shiny. However the loop it's hung by is too near the tip, it doesn't hang as shown, but points straight upward. I was disappointed to discover this, it just doesn't look like a proper Sagittarius sign when pointing straight up (instead of at an angle)."
2,"Nice, but terrible quality.","This is a ""cool,"" novel thing to have in your car. It dances to your music. How interesting.However, it also makes an annoying, high-pitched sound when turned on. I returned my first copy via warranty for a new one... same sound.Also, it completely stopped working after 2 weeks of use..."
4,HAIL & KILL!,"There are 3 kinds of metalheads:1) Those who love Manowar2) Those who think they're silly3) Those who love them anywayAs a proud member of group 3, Blood in Brazil just reinforces my belief that either Manowar is entirely serious and they just don't realize how hilarious they really are, like when Joey DeMaio shows up at the show and calls dibs on the entire PA as his bass rig.Out of the Hell on Earth series, I'd suggest getting this one last. They play some rather odd choices (Guyana, Dark Avenger, Army of Immortals). However, I got a kick out of watching them make the French version of Courage because the French guy who is coaching Eric on how to pronounce the words correctly starts to get impatient.Obviously, any Manowar fan is required to own this DVD, but I'd recommend getting Part 3 and The Absolute Power first."
3,Interesting tale of the Modoc war.,"""Muckaluck"" is based on a little-known Indian war in California versus the Modoc people in the late 1860s-early 1870s. It follows the white leaders who are foolish, and the Indians, who only want to have all their land to themselves. Captain Jack is their wise leader, and he is forced into making decisions he doesn't want, both to please his overeager subordinates and to placate the white man. Tragedy occurs when the racist settlers attack, and the natives overreact and kill innocents. Some parts are funny, some disturbing, but not enough to recommend"
3,I found the Kotex Freedom Thin Maxi Pads ...,"I found the Kotex Freedom Thin Maxi Pads to be light and slim. They reminded me of the very first products I used when I first started menstruating. They don't have the wonderful innovation of those """"panty-protector"""" wings of other brands, though, which is a significant disadvantage on heavy flow days. They're perfect for light days at the end of your period, when you don't want to use a tampon."
4,This product would be worth paying for. The ...,"This product would be worth paying for. The pads worked well and I'd feel comfortable recommending them to friends and family. I wouldn't, however, call it an outstanding product. I think that other brands with the same absorbency would work just as well."
3,I like the length -- it was longer ...,"I like the length -- it was longer than other brands I'd used. I didn't like the width. It seemed too narrow. It wasn't bulky, so it was comfortable. As advertised, it should be used on light days (or maybe as a backup to tampons on a heavy day). The product wasn't significantly different from other similar pads that I've used, so I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to my friends."
3,I'm not sure what this product was intended ...,"I'm not sure what this product was intended for, but it seems to me little more than a pantiliner. It didn't work well for me. Maybe women with really light periods would find this useful. I probably won't use it again and wouldn't recommend it"
4,The Kotex Freedom Thin Maxis are a product ...,"The Kotex Freedom Thin Maxis are a product worth purchasing for light flow days. I liked the fact that they come individually wrapped so they're easy to carry in my purse. The discreteness of a thin maxi is a big plus in my opinion. However, these pads seem to be designed for a light flow only, so the purchaser should keep that in mind."
3,Fair-to-middling set of obscure Brazilian styles,"A far-flung but fairly wimpy 4-CD set that features about four hours of mostly-instrumental music drawn from this label's vast catalog. It's not actually a proper compilation so much as a collection of albums... each disc features a separate group: Os Ingenuos, Oficina De Cordas, Camarao, and the Fred Dantas/Ailton Reiner ensemble each tackle a separate style -- choro, forro, etc. Like many choro albums, this disc might be best taken in small dose, but there is some truly fabulous musical virtuousity on display here. The forro disc has the greatest variety, but they're all worth checking out. A great introduction to the styles, and the label."
5,book worm reivew,"this book was one of her best. I have read a lot of her books and this is One of her best (and she has a lot)i wish They weren't as sad, but that is what makes them SOOOOOOOOO GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Beautiful photography, but not much information . . .","This book did a good job of telling about the different families of anurans, but there was very little practical information for the first time frog keeper. It isn't too bad of an investment, though, if you are trying to figure out what kind of frog you have."
3,Good guide,"Not excellent, but nothing wrong with it either. Good basic guide. Very middle-of-the-road. Good place to start if you are thinking about keeping amphibians."
1,CAT EXCAVATOR,"I agree with the rest of the reviews. This excavator is a beautiful and real looking CAT truck. My boys HAD to have it. Unfortunately, my 3 and 5 year olds only played with it a few times before the rubber tracks fell off AND the arm stopped working. I would really like a replacement. It was $50.00 -- on the expensive side for a child's toy. If someone knows where we can get an ""exchange"" I would feel a whole lot better about my purchase. :( ~Cathy"
2,Where to go for help,"Like many others, the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well Who can we contact for help? There is NO information on the box."
1,Great for 30 minutes,My 5 year old loved the thing for the first 30 minutes until the ruber track in the wheels broke in too. Nothing on the box to try and get parts and a bit expensive just to write off. The excavator is so realistic in looks and operation but just doesn't look like it is made to hold up under even mild indoor conditions. ??? what is the intent if it won't hold up on carpet???
1,CAT Excavator,"I purchased this product for my 3-year-old grandson on his birthday. He played with it for about 15 minutes when we decided that it was a little old for him and we would wait a few months before letting him play with it again. While in storage, both tracts that make the Excavator go forward and reverse broke. Because of the time that passed, understandably, I had no recourse. What a disappointment for a toy that had so much potential for fun. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOY UNLESS YOU HAVE $60.00 TO WASTE IN 15 MINUTES."
3,Not Great for Manual Play,"This toy initially lived up to its reputation, but since my 3-year-old sometimes uses the remote control and sometimes uses his hands to operate the excavator, the excavator's bucket has lost a lot of its remote-controlled movement. Also, the controls were difficult for our son to figure out (he's right at 3 years old), and I don't think he's less intelligent or less dexterous than other kids his age (of course: I'm his mom). He has used other remote control toys with no problem. This is probably a great toy if the child is at least 4, has lots of experience with fairly complex remote controls, and won't be tempted to use his hands to operate it."
3,merrick dollies,Where it wont affect the function of this product the paint was terrible on these. What didn't fall off from the surface not being prepped properly (and I have to laugh at the professionally primed and painted in the add didn't see any primer)was knocked off from inferior packing
4,Vast Amount of Detailed Statistics,"If you are looking for one easy-to-read collection of statistics on college bowl games, this is your book! While it is not ""exciting"" reading, as few stats books are, the ""History of College Bowls Games"" is full of detailed information on every aspect of EVERY bowl game since the beginning of college football bowls.Highly recommended as a resource for those looking to brush up on their bowl statistics knowledge - or to give as a gift to those persons who are always debating relatives/friends because of their ""poor stats memory"" at holiday football celebrations."
4,yes... no... yes...yes... no... alright?,"This band sounds so much, ok too much like Pinback. I'm a huge fan of Pinback and all Rob's and Armistead's work. I must have listened to this album a hundred times. I like it but I can also put it down . This melodic style of guitars and harmonizing of vocals catches me every time. But, this album is weak lyrically and is musically amature. Three stars at the most. I gave four stars because I do think they have potential for a better second album if they make one. The Metal Hearts are an 18 year old and 19 year old duo, so they have plenty o' time to get polished. This album could of used better production too. I will keep an ear out for these guys. Also, check out System Officer(Armistead's side project)."
2,No Pleasures Here,"The most annoying problem here is that this book's prose flip-flops from British Cockney slang to something out of a Ph.D. dissertation. One wonders if the target audience is academic or adolescent. I would like to see more quotes from the band members, especially Ferry. Too much time is spent on Brian Eno, who was only with the band in the very early days. His influence was abandoned by the time Roxy Music's defining album ""Avalon"" was released. Ferry needs to be the topic of the book. He is the genius behind Roxy Music's success, not Eno.Little attention is given to the band's personal life. Bryan Ferry's infamous break-up with Jerry Hall is summed up in a few short pages. Some commentary should be made on Ferry's statements regarding the matter.All in all, the information is incomplete and unsatisfying. I learned more from Jerry Hall's biography _Tall Tales_ than I did from this book. Don't waste your time."
2,Not very good....,"But at the time it was the only Roxy Biography that had been issued in ages, so it had to do. It was a major annoyance; first, the writer seemed to think any post-Eno work was below average, brushing off a classic album like ""Siren"" as weak. The author also has a highly warped view of America, speaking in ignorant and generalized terms about the music fans and markets (not understanding why Americans don't like EP's, for example). The whole ""cultural biography"" tilt basically lets the author go off and half-heatedly discuss Roxy's influence and the like, but this is a failure as well. Not recommended."
1,I was very disappointed in this book,"For anyone looking for a true Jewish cookbook - this is definetively not it! It may be a nice family cookbook overall but recipes for shrimp and taco salad (with meat, cheese and sourcream) should not be included in a book that calls itself ""jewish"". I have found that a lot of people rely on Jewish cookbooks to determine which dishes are considered kosher but I hope that nobody will come to that conclusion while using this book."
1,NOT as described and NOT of quality,"The item I received was NOT as described and NOT of quality. At first I was tempted to assume that I had received the wrong item until I read the reviews below where someone had mentioned their surprise in the color. This is because the color is orange. No issue there. The thing is, it arrived with two screws VERY loose, all other screws protruding from the other side, lacks a fast rewind mechanism, casing is very flimsy, and the best part? The tape begins with an apparently random length (in my case, 37cm) of extra tape attached prior 0 marker for metric. This wouldn't have been a problem, except that I bought specifically for use with metric. I had high hopes from the other reviews, but I need a quality tape. On a side note, CFV is not the manufacturer, merely another seller of this item, it is manufactured by American Tool Exchange, made in China, and DOES contain a chemical, (probably lead) warning."
2,Poorly Made!,I will keep it short and sweet.I purchased this and when it arrived it was broken and poorly made. I returned it for a refund and purchased a better quality one.
3,Product good for price but shipping broken,"I knew I wasn't buying a top of the line product and actually good for the price. I like they are almost all plastic because I'll be using them for underwater measurements. So product was ok though a little fragile in the windup spindle and that's where shipping made its mark. Poorly packaged with no padding at all. Both arrived broken. One still useable but the other will need replacement engineering of windup core. Apart from broken, they are just what I need for underwater amateur mapping."
4,Physics day tape measure,I was unable to find a 300m metric rule in the local community. THis rule is priced less than the rules that had only English markings.
1,you get what you pay for,"Do not buy this tape. Spend the extra couple bucks and get a real tape measure. 1.) the entire reel is made of extremely cheap plastic that makes you afraid to do anything to it for fear of it falling apart before you can use it. 2.) If you are only wanting to use this for U.S. standard measuring (feet and inches), then you will be okay but on the metric side of the tape it doesn't even start at zero! It starts at -.4 meters. 3.) Don't plan on measuring anything accurately because of the plastic tape. There is so much stretch that it is impossible to know how far you are actually measuring from point to point. (and no i'm not talking about a minor variation that is found even in metal tapes) more like a couple feet of variance after only 30-40 feet of tape extended. Find a good quality metal tape and spend a few extra bucks... it is worth it."
1,god's teeth!,"god's teeth! says the hero over and over again. the writing is obvious and heavy-handed, full of cliches and characters that are not developed and need to be either cut out of the story or given a better reason to stay. and there is ZERO steam!"
5,Circumstantial Evidence,"Circumstantial evidence almost gets our heroine, Cecily, a trip to the goal. It is up to our hero, Alex, to puzzle it out and make a match of it. Unfortunately, he is hindered by Cecily's need to, covertly of course, exert her independence by constantly being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Cecily's life would not be in such a muddle if it weren't for her poor timing, her younger sister's need to crush on every single titled handsome man who comes within her orbit, a mother who has no notion she should want better for her daughters than she had, and a horse who dances. Good thing we love muddles."
3,Not as bad as they say,"The examples in this book are decent. It has a path from beginner to intermediate that is acceptable. I think its main setback is that it doesnt really get into how the data is being parsed based on the code you write. Something he doesnt explain in the book that I found out the hardway (getting laughed at by the geeks in efnet-#php) is that globals are not turned on by default. This book assumes they are and doesnt tell you what thats all about. I would recommened this book to someone who doesnt want to learn php, but is more interested in stealing some codebits to put some projects up quickly. While I refer to it from time to time, when I do, im usually looking for the mickey mouse approach which this book seems to embrace. I wonder if I am allowed to say mickey mouse in a review."
2,Code examples need work.,"This book looked promising from the reviews. The code examples were buggy, I stopped trying to work through this book and picked up PHP Essentials by Julie Meloni and had a much better experience.There are better beginner books, get one of those instead."
5,An awesome book,"I just recently bought this book, and I must say that it has helped me a lot, and I am not even half way through it yet. I had always wanted to learn PHP, and I tried to get tutorials over the internet, but I was getting nowhere. Then I saw this book and decided to pick it up. within the night I got it, I was already writing simple PHP scripts. This book has many visual examples written out that you can modify and add to. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone that wishes to learn the power of PHP!"
2,Get a book with debugged code,"Don't waste your moneyI bought this book after reading the reviews here and my experience with one of their other books (A Beginners Guide Flash MX, this was a very good book). I have had nothing but a headache trying to get the code to work from chapter 4 and 5. I've given up and don't recommend this book to anybody until the code is debugged. I feel I shouldn't have to go to PHP sites to get help in debugging code. Too bad from the reviews it looked promising but alas buy another book on introductory PHP."
1,a pan with holes?!,"I received these pans as a wedding gift. really liked them initially, especially the lids. two months later, and two of the pans have developed holes in them. not scratches, but actual holes through the wall of the pan. i have no idea how this happened- i can't see how food or dishwashing soap could possibly be so corrosive. obviously this is a major flaw with this product."
4,Cracked lid!!!,"My lid was cracked and damaged, evidently from pre-packaging as there were pieces missing from the lid but they were not in the box. Careless packer there.The pans, on the other hand, look very sturdy and damage free. I will update later when I have used them."
5,Bought This For My Boss,"I already have a set of these, and I love them. I take them to company potlucks, etc., and my boss commented that she really liked them. When she got married, I gave her this set for a wedding gift, and she loves hers too."
4,What happened to Yourcongress.com???,"I found this book because I am still wondering what happened to yourcongress.com, one of my favorite websites ever. If this book is as informative as the website was, it has to be great. For 12 years I went to Capitol Hill as an unpaid advocate for medical research funding, and YCDC kept me sane. I hope Mr. Porter will compile a book from what he put on YCDC someday, or--even better--revive the website!"
3,Good: If you have no basic knowledge of the Hill,"This book is good for those with no basic knowledge of the Hill. Learn the key words and how things work. However, it's best to just start with an internship - the best way to get a job on the Hill is building connections through networking."
3,Good general information,"This book has a lot of good information in it, from summaries of the different positions on Capitol Hill to who to talk to when pursuing your job. However, if you already have a decent knowledge of Congress functions, not a lot of it will be new to you. There are a few choice nuggets of insight that I wouldn't have thought of on my own, however, and for that reason the book was worth it."
2,"Fresh, but no substantial content","Yeah, sure these guys are fresh and against the mainsteam/gangsta rap that is litterin the radio these days. I am all for that. But they are missing the 2 most essential elements of hip hop; lyrics and beat. While everybody else's reviews say their lyrics contain phat rhyme scheme, I think otherwise. Yeah, sure they rhyme but the tone and the fluency of rhyme schemes are not very impressive. Mainly, the lyrics are thwarted by the next major fault with these guys- their beats. The jazzy stuff definitely does not work for them. They make them appear somewhat sing song and pop-like. All in all, it just doesn't work."
1,"Almay Antiperspirant & Deodorant, Unscented","This is my perferred antiperspirant and deodorant. Unscented, anti-allergenic. Not gooey like the gel version that seems to be the only version available in our local drug stores, ie Walgreen, Safeway and CVS. The gel or solid variety is OK for travel but not for every day use, in my opinion."
5,Almay,"I was so happy to be able to get this through Amazon. I no longer can find this product in most stores and because of an allergic reaction, I need to use a deodorant for sensitive skin and this one does do the trick."
4,Works well,Still get some wetness but there is no smell or irritation. I might try the stick version when I finish the roll-on.
5,My wife tried the product and she was ...,My wife tried the product and she was very pleased with it. In fact she's going to switch completely to these pantyliners from now on. The scent was very nice and not as strong or overwhelming as with similar products. They really stayed in place during the whole day. Overall it's a wonderful product and she can definitely recommend it to everyone.
4,I was very satisfied with the product. I ...,"I was very satisfied with the product. I found them to be absorbent but not bulky. Comfortable to wear, and the light scent made me feel more secure about odors. I'd recommend them to anyone."
2,Light fresh scent and absorbs well. Protects better ...,"Light fresh scent and absorbs well. Protects better than some other similar products I've tried. However, a longer version would help protect underpants better. Scent is also better than other similar products I've tried. Economy pack is economical and the price that drugstore.com offers is very comparable to that of the name-brand super stores."
3,Appearances can be deceiving,"I bought this phone for my home office, as the signal on the cordless 5.2 Ghz Panasonic was apparently being picked up by the neighbors! This phone if filled with functions, however looks can be deceiving. First the dial pad is rigid to the point that it does not register the numbers unless you press firmly on the key pad when dialing. Also it needs batteries to power up the LCD and not just for backup, a charger is not provided with the phone either. In speaker mode, when you hang up the phone, it does not drop the line, instead sometimes I need to lift the handset and put it down to drop the line. So overall, it works if your not picky, but it should be better then this, but again its made after all by SBC!"
2,not that great,This is an expensive phone that I had to ship back to Intellitouch for a replacement because the message indicator light was out. The ringer has two settings - loud and LOUD. Buttons are cheap and the cradle is awkward.
3,A little simplistic. But worth reading for the masses,"Very short. More like a booklet.Unlike the other reviewers, I have no vested interest. I dont know the author personally.I would give it a 3 and a half stars.It appears a new updated version will be coming out in late 2004."
3,"ill-presented, but the information is in there somewhere","This book is not for begninners, but for someone who already knows the basic stuff. The material is presented in a very ad-hoc manner. The chapters and subsections do not follow the standard ""say what you are going to say - say - and say what you said"" format. New concepts are thrown at you with no lead or introduction. But the material is there. So it is a good reference book. This book can use a good editor."
2,Just OK,I was expecting more deatils in terms of equations and derivations of the material. This book was kept to an overview. I was not impressed.
1,Will permanently damage auto paint!!,"I purchased this product to reattach my Porsche emblem onto the rear of my car. I figured 3M Emblem Adhesive was just for this application, as stated on ts own LABEL!!! Well after applying it, I had to redo one emblem because it was slightly off. To my horror, after removing the emblem, there was a raised effect of the clearcoat!! This permanently damaged the finish due to some chemical reaction. I did further research and this product would have gone down to the primer if left on. I will have to reapply the emblem using the automotive double sided tape to cover up this damage forever...."
5,Good old 3M Adhesive,"It's like 10 bucks or so. This stuff works great. I've found that more flammable it is; the better it works. I'll pay the higher price for the good stuff , not that "" eco friendly "" garbage others are trying to sell. IT's made in the USA ."
4,"Best boss-battles ever, but that's it!","Games made by Treasure have always been known for wild and crazy boss-battles. In a way, ""Stretch Panic"" is the ""purest"" Treasure game. The bulk of the game is really *just* boss-battles. Before you give up on it though, let me say this. I've been playing video games since Atari 2600. I've played thousands of games and probably fought tens of thousands of bosses and the boss battles in ""Stetch Panic"" are the most insane and wildly original ever put in a game. The only thing that keeps it from being a perfect game is the fact that bosses are all there really is. Sure, there are some ""in between"" levels where you beat the heck out of cartoon girls with huge breasts (I'm not kidding), but the only goal is to get enough ""points"" to fight another boss. No exploration, no collecting, no cast of zany characters.As long as you know what you are getting into, this game is easy to recomend, but think of it more as an ""arena battle"" type game than a platformer."
3,"Good, but Short","I purchased this game today, expecting, well, a game. I was hoping for a mario or sonic type adventure where you go through levels, defeat bosses, find secrets, etc. Instead of all that, you get just the bosses. No levels, no secrets, no collecting, just dorrs to each one of the bosses. Now this isnt necessarily a bad thing, its a very fun game. The bosses are all extremly entertaining to fight, but all and all its more of a boss royale than a game. It is good though, so it really depends on what your looking for."
2,I just don't get it.,"I think others have reviewed this game in a vacuum when they gave this game a good reviews. This game is repetitive and the plot is contrived, though I agree it is unique. Without reading the accompanying booklet , I think many plots can be imagined that fit this game. In conclusion, in an effort to be unique, the creators of this game made it a mediocre action videogame that is basically an unusual demonstration of some unique graphics. I ask myself what the reviewers were thinking when they gave this game good reviews, and I conclude they must be the relatives of the authors or have played very few games in this genre."
5,The Pesach Story,"This is one of them most remarkable children's books about the Pesach story, with a wonderful rhyming storytelling style as good as Dr Seuss, Shoshanna Lepon gets the story of Pesach and Moses struggle to free the Jews from Egypt, across to children loud and clear.This is done in a delightful way-and the illustrations are also wonderful and amusing.A must for all Jewish children, the book can also be enjoyed by Christian children, to learn the story of Moses and Pharaoh.At the end of the book, there are some questions for discussion, and a fascinating `Did you know' page, with some things that many adults will find interesting to discover about Egypt and the Ten Plagues."
3,Not Kesey's best but still worth a read,"I agree that this isn't Kesey's best work, but I have a personal reason for loving this book -- my great-Grandfather Parsons Motanic is a character (and he was a character) in this novel. Kesey never claimed that this was a true and factual account of the Pendleton round up, and he apologized to the people of Pendleton for taking liberties with the story. He got most of the details regarding my great-Grandfather wrong but I still enjoy the book and absolutely love that Kesey and Babbs included a picture of Parsons Motanic in the book. The narrative is jerky (much like motion pictures of the time) but some of the language is lyrical and almost lives up to Kesey's early works."
3,It's okay,Just blame my taste but I didn't finish Last Go Round nor did my husband. I can't think of anyone who would like it enough to give it to. It is meant to be told humorously and was missing our laugh button. Maybe it works for someone else.
3,"Good Book, but not the best ever.","For me this was a nostalgic trip back to the days when I sat next to my dad in the ""sun bleachers"" at Pendleton Round-Up. Mention of framiliar names like, Crabby's, and Hamley's enhanced the authenticity of this book. I didn't think it was near the best ever done by Kesey. I thought it could maybe have been more descriptive and a bit more knowledgable on Rodeo itself. (Maybe talk to some modern day Rodeoers?)"
3,Caution History is Not Always As It Seems,"This Ken Kesey story is a mix of truth and fiction. Located in Pendleton, OR in 1911 at the original rodeo or Round Up as it is still called. The main characters are Jonathan Lee Spain, an Indian named Jackson Sundown and a black man named George Fletcher. It is a tightly focused story of a few days in their lives at Pendleton along with a sub plot involving Buffalo Bill Cody and a very strange wrestler named Frank Gotch. The book contains photos from those early days so you know that some of these fellows really lived including on of Spain that continued to rodeo even after he lost a hand in a roping accident.This one is great fun and uses the mortar of fabrication to hold the rocks of truth in place. It's a quick and easy read and does offer a glimpse of yesterday but be warned it has neither the depth or polish of Kesey's earlier works such as ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" or ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
2,Ugh... I spent $15 on this?,I'm a bit disappointed that I had to spend $15 to transfer my files to my PS3 from my PS2... but I'm more disappointed that I lost the receipt so that I couldn't return it when I was done.I REEEAAAALLLY don't think this is worth $15... unless you NEED to transfer your PS2 or PSX files.Other than that it works great 0_o
4,Great for saving without using hard drive space.,The memory adapter does just what it states. Great for saving your ps1 or ps2 games without having to use your hard drive space on your ps3 or playing where you left off last from the other systems.
5,Works Perfect,"This product works perfectly! The only flaw is that when you recieve it, it doesn't come with the cord. Guess you should have a cord at all times."
5,sony playstation 3 memory card adaptor,Item performed just as described. Received it in a very comfortable time period and was packaged sufficiently.
3,"Necessary, cheap, but really ....","Well, you need that if you want to enjoy the retro-compatibility and have some ps2 saves lying around. Kind a of pain in the neck since you can't do much with it, like copying or saving directly to the mem card which may be frustrating if you want to move your datas. They'll propbably find a way to do it in the near future but for now this item has only one use, and is not very polyvalent."
3,does what it's supposed to do,This card adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do. It's just a bit more expensive than I would like it to be.
1,Adapter works just the way it says. yay.,"I've always had a problem with these companies charging me to gain access to saves on the games I've already paid for. I can't imagine it would have been that much trouble to include a PS2 memory card slot on the PS3. Just another chance to squeeze a little more profit out of us helpless consumers. The adapter works fine, but it shouldn't be required in the first place."
1,USELESS with large memory cards,"I don't know why, but this stupid thing won't read my 64MB PS2 memory card and I read somewhere online that it will only work with the 8MB cards- complete waste of money..."
1,Pain in the a**,"It is amazing that this product is even for sale. Sony put a bunch of different memory card slots in their console but nothing for their loyal Playstation 1 and 2 owners. I guess they just weren't thinking when it canme to that, or they were thinking about how much $$ they could make. The product is good for retrieving old saves from a PS1 or 2 but it takes all of 5 minutes then you're done with it. Hopefully you've saved the reciept or just share it amongst yourselves."
4,Must have.,This is a must have if you brought a PS3 and have older games on your PS2 Memory card. The only bad thing is: it ONE way transfer only. If you play and saved a game on your PS3 and you want to tranfer that game file to bring to your friend's house... you cant.
2,Worth it if you have a lot of PS2 games,"I must say, I totally wasted my money on this. Since I only had 1 PS2 game and all the saves for that game didn't work at all. Very dissapointing."
3,Really only for one time use.,The product does what it is supposed to do...then what? After you transfer the games it is a useless object. I recommend buying used as I should have because I will be selling mine soon and it was only used for about 5 minutes.
1,Did this product actually work for anyone?,This adapter just plain doesn't work. My memory card works in the PS2 but I can't get the info onto the PS3. It just stops half way through. This is terrible.
3,Helpful if compatible.,"This product was of great use the one time I used it. It is easy to use and works quickly. In retrospect. I would have just borrowed one or tried to find a used one. Another note, before you buy, make sure your PS3 is backwards compatible."
3,Memory Card Adapter,"It does exactly what it claims to, copy your PS1 and PS2 memory card files over to your PS3. It's only useful if your PS3 is backwards compatible ie. the 80 GB or 60 GB versions. And even then, you only need to use it once. I recommend getting it used since I'm sure the seller will have only used it once and it will still be in perfect condition."
3,A little misleading,Maybe I didn't read the description properly but in the picture it looks like you just plug it straight into your PS3 but in actual fact you also need to buy the connecting lead. Other than that it works fine.
3,Ehhh,"Well, like most people before me have said, you pretty much only use it once. It is good for transferring your saves to the ps3's virtual memory card. However, if you are like me and travel alot, and like to take the more portable systems with you, this really isn't a great buy. The adapter converts your saves into .psv files which only the ps3 can read.Unfortunately I found out that my Legend of Dragoon and Chrono Cross saves were stuck on my ps3 because they were converted to .psv. If you try to send back the information from the virtual memory card to the physical memory card, the games in which you use the saves will hang up when you try to load because they cannot read the format in which the save is in.I cannot give this hardware any more than a 2 because of this fact. It is almost unforgivable that all my old saves are now only useful on a ps3, which as you all know is huge and certainly not portable."
3,So So,"I am disappointed with this music. I am dying and looking for a really soothing music that can help me. Instead, I have an accasionally irritating music that sometime gives me migraine. Dr Jusuf Hariman, BA, BEc, LLB, BA(Hons), MA, MBA, PHD, Hon Psy D"
4,Stitch A Child's Quilt,"My two grandsons, who are members of Y-Indian Guides, asked me if I would make them ""Indian"" quilts. Well, being somewhat new to quilting, and not having much of an imagination, I went on a book and pattern search. When I came across this book and found a Teepee quilt in it, I was thrilled. The book is filled with terrific quilt ideas for children. Ms. Thomas's instructions are very clear and concise, and made the experience relatively painless. The results were two beautiful quilts that the boys absolutely loved! I can't wait to get started on some of her other great quilting ideas in the book. If you are a quilter with children or grandchildren, the addition of this book to your quilting library is a must."
1,Typhoon Professional 12-Inch Carbon Steel Wok,it is a very cheap product; it rusts big time for the first time I used. I was very disappointed on the wok. It is a very low quality wok and I never used it again after the first time.
2,Caveat Emptor,"If you have lots of extra time to clean up leaking water, this your coffee maker! We are on our third (and last) one of these over the past two years (apparently we're slow to learn), and all three have developed leaking problems, primarily when brewing."
3,Two in last year,"I bought this for style and color. First one died in a couple of months. Got it replaced at Target for free, which was great. Now I've had this one for about 9 months. It started to brew so slowly it literally took 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Cleaning several times did not help. Nice looking but not worth the $$. Something must be wrong with design."
5,Exactly as described,"These handlebars are strong and very shiny. They were easy to put on the bike.I purchased them after reading other reviews suggesting putting them on a mountain bike. That's what I tried, and they did fit. I had to replace the brake cables, which was not a big deal. They didn't make the bike any more comfortable, though, and the curve of the bars made me feel crowded on the bike. There also wasn't enough room for the shifters, brakes and grips. If you're putting them on a bike with grip shifters, then it might work better.Honestly, if you're uncomfortable riding a mountain bike and are hoping these handlebars will make it a more pleasant ride, they probably won't. Look into comfort bikes or hybrid bikes. The right bike is a lot of fun and great exercise at the same time, but the handlebars aren't the only thing that makes a comfort bike comfortable."
4,A fine product - no problems,"I got my wife two of these for Christmas (she has a terrible habit of leaving her rings lying around). We keep one in the upstairs bathroom and one down in the kitchen. I was hesitant at first, because I read earlier reviews that said these were prone to tipping over. We are both delighted with them. They always stay upright, even if she puts three or four rings on them, and they are attractive. This is a fine product."
2,Is cute but....,Is cute! it holds your ring! but sadly the finish fade out really fast even it just sit there.... .
1,wipers wont fit,"i WOULD PUT 00 STARS if I could !There is no way tom these wipers fit even though your site says they fit my make and model.Very hard to reach a rep ,and over half the price to return!!! wha a scam!!!"
4,a Good thermometer,"It comes with a plastic tray that the thermometer slides into. Then, you slide that tray into a crudely-magnified plastic tube. You still have to turn it around back and forth to be able to see the line, but the magnification does help.Pros: Magnifier does make it a little easier to read than most mercury-styles. In practical use, by slipping it into the plastic case to read it, you naturally store it safe and secure.Cons: This thermometer does take 6 minutes for an accurate reading. It is also pretty wide (although the very tip is 1/8"", it widens to about 3/8""), which is a little uncomfortable to hold in your mouth compared to the old-fashioned 1/8"" type.Regarding the one review, it has withstood many rinses in the sink, but, I will admit that it does seem like it might be fragile - it is a thin piece of glass. Just be gentle with it."
1,Doesn't measure temperature,Mine stays between 98.6 and 1 and 2 ticks above that. I put it under my arm for 10 minutes. No change. In the fridge for a week. No change. What's the point of the fluid inside if it's not temperature sensitive? And what's the point of this product?
2,Not the best MAT study guide out there,"There are two main problems with this study guide:1. The practice tests are not in the same format as the actual MAT that you will be taking today; 120 questions in 60 minutes. This is critical because half of the battle when taking the MAT's is learning how to pace yourself properly so that you have enough time to answer all of the questions on the exam and perhaps have some time at the end to review your answers to questions that you found tricky.2. The study content provided in this book is sometimes presented in a manner that is more complicated than it need be and I found that the Kaplan MAT guide was easier to understand, gave the user great MAT test taking strategy, had practice tests identical to the actual MAT, contained more content that was on the actual MAT exam that I took and overall prepared me so much better than the McGraw-Hill's MAT guide."
4,good book but test is hard!,"One bad thing - book arrived with no paperwork, no receipt or anything.Book is a good tool to prep for the test, BUT the test is almost impossible to study for. I am generally good at analogies, but in the case you have to know a lot of content. The practice tests are good an varied, and the last section has some good knowledge references. I would recommend starting way before you need to - I got this about 3 weeks before my test and wish I had got it sooner. However, none of my real test questions were any that were on these practices, but it is a good book to get you used to the test format."
4,"great game, small price","This game was way more then I expected. Not only does it include all three characters, but it also has the missing stage from the SNES versions; once beaten you can choose trhe option to turn on rapid attack, and pick different outfits for you fighter. My only complaint is since it's on GBA the screen is small and that makes it hard to see some enimies coming at you. Overall this is a solid port of the arcade game with some additional content."
5,Final fight one rules!,"This game, is well amazing. It has great graphics and also supurb gameplay. Its not really that long, but the fun doesn't go downhill when you play it again. I'd say the only bad part of this game is... well nothing! There really is nothing wrong with the game, i mean smooth gameplay and everytthing i mentioned above. Definitely worth the money. I got this game for christmas and im still playing it!(i've already beat it MANY times) And i really do hope that they make a sequal!"
2,Bleech,"I'm conflicted. I will have to go to the library and borrow some of the other Carol Ashton mysteries. I get the feeling I might like her. However, in this book, I hate the woman she is guarding so much that I put the book down. What a witch. Within a page of meeting Marla Strickland, I wanted to kill her, despite agreeing with some of her opinions. I mean really, one of your office workers is killed by a letter bomb and you don't care? You meet the woman who is your bodyguard and the first thing you say to her is ""you don't look like a dyke""? What is wrong with this picture?Bleech."
5,An indispensable research volumn.,"'Pacific Electric Stations' by noted architect and Pacific Electric historian John Heller should be a part of any Southern California Transit library. Here you will find many rare and to date unpublished photographs of Pacific Electric passenger and freight stations, along with location maps and other pertinent information on perhaps the nation's greatest interurban transit system. Much of what is here is simply not available anywhere else."
3,Good for parents not educators or dance teachers,I bought this because I teach preschool dance classes and was hoping for some fresh ideas. The video was very short and didn't have a lot to offer. It would be good for a family who was looking for something to do at home--good for a mom or dad who had no experience with kids movement exercises. But for a creative parent or dance educator there is just nothing new in the video and it really has very little to offer. I appreciated the enthusiasm of cast but I was just hoping for more--lots more.
2,Boring!,"This book has absolutely nothing to distinguish it as an instructive chess book for intermediate players. The annotations are bland and un-informative. Comparable games collections by Kasparov, Nunn, Timman, Korchnoi, Gligoric, Karpov, and countless others far exceed this work by Anand. You can get a games collection of any player downloaded off the internet, so the only reason to buy a games collecion is for its instructive or informational value. But this 300+ page work is full of comments like, ""I figured if this move was good enough for Tal, it was good enough for me."" Real enlightening, huh? This is a well-produced GAMBIT publication, but for whatever reason, Anand's writing is very bland. This is an un-inspired work. It is one of the few chess books that I have returned after purchasing. Completely unnecesary. Obviously, Anand is an all-time great player. But he is no writer or teacher."
4,Anand unleashed,"This book shows some of Anands best games from the year 1986-2000. They show games against some of the best players in the world such as Kasparov, Kramnik, Shirov etc. Each game teaches a concept, wheter it be positional, tactical or an endgame. I had difficulty following the lines as he gave analysis of 2-3 pages after a move. It seemed that a better job could have been done with a verbal explanation for the average player. This book is good if you are USCF 2000 or above and do not require as much hand holding. The openings played were varied with major emphasis on the Sicilian Richter Rauzer, Najdorf, and Ruy Lopez Anands specialties. Most of the games are extremely tactical and highly interesting, but very difficult to comprehend for a club player. The analysis from each game would need to be reviwed several times to be digested. Highly recommended for the expert level player and above."
5,This beats pokemon all the way.,"This is probaly the best out of the whole season. When season 2 came on I coulden't wait to watch every episode. It's pretty much my favorite. Anyways watch it this espically if your a really big ken fan...Now. I just wanna say even If the name sounds like ""poke mon"" Theres a huge difference between digimon and pokemon! I used to think that too when I heard about the show but then I realized that it was for more than the name and cute little animals.Well, I just wanted to make that point... but anyways I really liked this and it's worth the money.Like most people say I really like the ken sage. It's very dreep and emotional. If your like 7 maybe It's just cool but when you get a bit older watch it and youll see the real meaning of the whole thing."
5,This should put to rest all comparisons with Pokemon...,"I started watching Digimon about the middle of season one, if only because my son watched it and we only have one television in the house. I find it a lot more emotionally involved than Pokemon, with more emotional subtext. Seson two was EXCELLENT, and these episodes prove it. Watching Wormons sacrifice and Ken's transformation was a truly educational experience for my son. Like an earlier reviewer I would love to see all the episodes involved in ""The Battle for Both Worlds"", possibly the best mini-series I have ever seen, on video or DVD."
5,Digimon Adventures,"This video has 4 episodes on it which deal with the end of Ken, the Digimon Emperor. In ""An Old Enemy Returns"", ""The Darkness Before Dawn"", and ""The Crest of Kindness"", the digidestined must stop Ken from destroying the Digital world. ""Genesis of Evil"" gives the story of how Ken became the Digimon emperor. These are great episodes and ""Genesis of Evil"" is one of the best episodes and is a very emotional one."
5,lovanime,"i had watched seasons 1,2 an now 3 of the digimon saga andi really liked season 2. this last 3 episode before kenchange back to his goos self are fenomenal. i specially likedthe way the characters are portrayed."
5,Start With Governing America,"This is an excellent book for students and people who want a better understanding about the principles of American government. This is a well-balanced as well as insightful book with historical background, theory, and the implications concerning democratic government."
3,Love these little cans but,"Love these smaller size cans that I can use up in one feeding and not have to cap and store in the fridge, BUT they're expensive! Like a dollar a can as compared to other cheaper brands which can run 79 cents for the huge size. What we do for our dogs!"
3,Difficult doesn't start to describe this puzzle,"I'm all for difficult puzzles, but this one takes it a step farther. The picture on the front of the box doesn't show the whole puzzle, so until you get a significant portion of the interior done, you have no idea what is up and down. While we haven't completed it yet (and we will!), I won't be buying another puzzle like this from this company (and I hope to find the receipt so I can return the other puzzle I did buy)."
3,"NICE STAND, BUT NOT FOR DVD/CDS","LOVE THIS STAND, EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. BUT ONCE CD/DVDS ARE IN IT, THE DRAWERS ARE HEAVY, AND WILL NOT SLIDE OUT RIGHT, HAVE TO HOLD AND LIFT UP ON THE DRAWER SO IT DOESN'T DRAG OR GET CAUGHT ON THE METAL FRAME."
3,Imara HRM strap versus Imara Fit strap,"My girlfriend has an Imara HRM watch (color ICE) and the strap is broken. I found that ParsecEnt.com sell the replacement, but the ice color is only for Imara fit or Imara run watches. Do you know if these straps are the same size that Imara hrm? If I buy an Imara fit or Imara run strap would it fit the HRM watch?Or is there any other site to by the replacement? Thanks"
4,"A great plane, flown by great men.","This book follows the Slow But Deadly Dauntless through WW2, and argues that the SBD has been underrated by Historians. The story of the pilot who refused to let his destroyed aircraft be pushed over the side of the carrier, even threatening to shoot anyone who tried, stayed with me for quite a while."
1,Terrible product,Be sure you read the reviews for the single user version before you plunk down any money for this dog.
3,DRAGS A LITTLE,"WAS HARD TO KEEP MY MIND ON THE BOOK. NEEDS A LITTLE MORE INTRIGUE. I NORMALLY GRAVITATE TO MEDICAL MYSTERIES, BUT THIS LEFT ME LOOKING FOR A NEW BOOK BEFORE I WAS EVEN DONE. SORRY."
5,Teriffic debut novel!!,"Move over, Robin Cook....this is a thrilling page turner from a doctor who knows what he's writing about. I loved the operating room segments. The suspense keeps building...some of the risks that Tyler took seem maybe a tad implausable in real life but HEY! made a really hard to put down story. Hope to see more from this talented author."
5,excellant,"yes,some of the tracks are mono, david rose is excellant musician,I loved holiday for strings(red skelton's theme song) remembered it when I was child watching tv during 50s"
4,Heartbreaking Episode,"""The Chute"" is where Tom and Harry get thrown into a prison, but Tom arrives there first, and is then under the control of ""The Clamp"". However, if I remember correctly, Harry isn't affected that much, only like 2-3 times, most likely more. But what really affects him is when Tom gets stabbed and then the episode takes a dramatic change. But you'll have to see the rest for yourself. Enjoy, but be ready for anything!"
1,"Steel is too thin, makes it weak.","I do not understand all the positive reviews. The shoe horn, folded onto itself after only about a week of use! This is with just basic twice a day usage, of putting on my sneakers, with no excessive force or abuse. The steel is just too thin, It folded right in the middle. I think being that long and thin makes it really weak. I really could not recommend this to anybody."
1,Shoe horn,"It is a very long horn, but when I was trying to use it putting a shoe on a bare foot, it got bent, I was very dissapointed about it. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent us a new one. Be very careful when you use it with bare feet, the rest it is a very useful item. Now I use it very careful."
5,footfiter shoe horn,I gave one to my 87 year old father and he loves it..I found myself using mine for the sport shoes and it works great..still is in use today
5,shoehorn,"the product was shipped on time, and the shoe horn was of good quality, and did the job it was intended for."
5,Twist of Lemmon is served with style and grace.,"In an era where children rant, rave and rat on their famous parents, this book is a delightful diversion. Smoothly told with love and humor, Jack Lemmon's life as a dad is portrayed from the mind and pen of his adoring son, Chris. It is a sweet, funny, and sometimes sad tale that is at the same time deeply touching. Their father-and-son time together is covered from celebrity roasts at the Hillcrest Country Club to hilarious golf, travel and fishing anecdotes. Also included are short vignettes about the ""everyman"" actor from notables such as Andy Garcia, Julie Andrews and Neil Simon."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you enjoy a depressing, detailed account of the way in which your favorite actor died in the hospital, you will enjoy this book. I didn't. If you are a golfer you might enjoy a detailed account of Jack golfing at Pebble Beach. As a non-golfer I found it to bevery boring. ""A Twist of Lemmon"" is indeed a lemon......"
2,well written but...,"depressing as each chapter starts with a final illness segment. Without that it would have been a MUCH better and more enjoyable book. It may have been cathartic and healing for Chris, but not so for me."
2,Get the soundtrack.,"Capcom went truly insane when they unleashed this bizarre arena fighting game. It's a shame you have to fight the non-controllable camera as much as your cartoony, futuristic opponents. Clearly, the budget went to the great tunes on the soundtrack, most of them by well-known bands. Now that the game and soundtrack are so cheap, you can buy them both with little regret. The game is not entirely horrible, just shallow and underdeveloped. Too bad you can't just stick this Dreamcast game into a standard CD player and get all the music. I know, I've tried...."
5,great little food processor,My husband got me this mini prep processor for Christmas and I love it. It is great for making fine cracker crumbs and stuff for breading. It is quick and easy to clean up and best of all it isn't bulky or too heavy. It is great for everyday use and saves me a lot of time.
5,really gets you walking,"i've been walking for a long time but this book got me walking every day instead of once in a while and taught me how to get the maximum out of my walks. i've stopped obssessing about my weight and my whole attitude towards my body and towards the concept of regular exercise has changed. the best thing about this book is that it is a daily, weekly and yearly companion that keeps you on the exercise regime. fenton's writing is guiless and honest -- a friendly push out the door. no criticism, just encouragement to start enjoying the natural movement of your own body. his frankness and simplicity are refreshing."
3,Walking Magazine Walking Guide,I'm in my fourth week of the guide. It is a doable plan with journal charts to keep me focused and motivated.
1,Unreliable,"Unfortunately, this book was written by a former Soviet spy and therefore the information contained within it must be held as suspect."
4,not the best,"1st of all...the new cover models are horrible! They look nothing like what I imagine the characters to be like. Anyways, this book has 3 basic storylines. 1st, Tia and Evan's college crisis, 2nd, Jessica and Elizabeth forgot a very important date and there is high drama to follow, and 3rd, Will and Melissa's break-up. Overall, this book is okay, but by far not the greatest in the series. I won't give anything away, but it's pretty predictable."
4,He's Really Into Pirates!,"My son loves this toy-- he got it for his birthday this summer and has gotten hours of enjoyment out of it. He loves to sword fight with us, but he's really safe with them because they are foam. The ""game"" of stabbing the right button does not work, however, because you have to stab the button really hard to make it work. But for the price and what it's for-- imaginative play that's safe and fun-- it's a great toy."
2,A 5 year old broke it,"My DS got this for his 3rd birthday. The age range states 5-9, so of course, my busy DS didn't really grasp the concept of hitting the target to release the sword. I liked it because it was made of foam, so my DS could practice dueling without crashing down on someone's hands.BUT, at his party, the correct 5 year old age range got a hold of his swords and I found them both broken on the ground! The swords broke off their bases. They lasted a total of 1 week. Sure, if your kid follows directions and plays for the 'target', then get these, but for the most part, most boys I know are going to duel just like Jack Sparrow!"
3,The Playtex Gentle Glide Deodorant Multi-pack is a ...,"The Playtex Gentle Glide Deodorant Multi-pack is a fine product from a trusted company. The multi-pack is a particularly nice innovation, as you have all the sizes you need for a cycle. Gentle Glide applicators are an improvement over cardboard UNLESS the little prongs start sticking up -- OUCH! The only fault I have with this product is the DEODORANT, which is highly unnecessary and possibly allergy producing."
5,I was really glad I tried the Playtex ...,"I was really glad I tried the Playtex Gentle Glide Deodorant Soft Plastic Applicator Tampons Multi-Pack. Before this, I wasn't aware that they even made multi-packs that had different size tampons. It was great not having to switch from one tampon box to another as my cycle changed. The applicator was very easy to use, gentle, and it didn't even pinch me. I would recommend that friends and family use these Playtex tampons because of their ease of insertion."
3,Well built but not enough light,This is a nicely designed and well made product. It feels like a simple design well constructed that will last some time. The problem is its only one LED so the light really is pretty low. To light a small tent its ok but definitely not a room. It also points a bit of a beam vs distributing light evenly even in room mode. The kick stand and hanger is nicely designed.Only buy if you really do not need a lot of light.
5,A real treat!,"It's a real treat to hear jazz master Benny Green perform with his protégé, the rising star Randy Napoleon. The pianist and the guitarist both give tremendous performances on this album, as do organist Jared Gold, drummer Quincy Davis, and bassist David Wang. They shine on the standards and amaze with originals by Napoleon. A must hear!"
1,Don't Be Fooled,"There is no `best of' BTO. This band is just a wrenched version of Bad Company or Free. All the tunes are terrible, You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet sounds like a weak cover version of someone else's song. Randy's vocals are a poor man's Fogerty, the lyrics are uninspiring, to say the least. Maybe it would have been good if Burton Cummings sang the tunes, but I doubt it. This is seventies `hard rock' at it's lamest and most formulaic. Give it a miss. F"
3,nice fabric poor fit,This top is nice at the neck and shoulders but from the armpits it drops straight down. For the price I'd have expected it to be slightly fitted at the waist. The fabric is a good quality synthetic.
3,These pads are nothing special,"I found these pads to be like many others: Bulky & uncomfortable...They shifted & bunched in my panties while I slept. When I woke up the pad had shifted a lot to the back of my underwear, & because of this, I had leaks...I won't buy these again."
1,Green Bay Packers Ceramic Travel Mug,"Very angry that 'dishwasher and microwave safe mug for hot or cold beverages' came in a box with a small sticker on bottom which states ""State of California PROP 65 This product contains or may contain a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects and other reproductive harm."" This was definitely not in the product description! With the cost of return shipping and the 15% restocking fee, it isn't even worth returning!! I am now going to have to scramble to get a new present for my friend - as I won't risk his health with this mug. THIS ITEM SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT ALL ANYWHERE !! I am going to enjoy breaking it and throwing it away."
2,"NIce Idea, poor quality control","I used it for about a month and then two of the three LEDs went out. When I touch the two that did light at first, they light up and then go out again, obviously a bad connection internally. Otherwise, it's a nice light and easily bright enough for reading at night."
3,"Good Illumination, Bad Angle For Reading","Unless you want a bulging disc from hanging your head down to read, this light isn't for you. The angles offered by the Beam N Read are not friendly to the reader who likes to hold their head more up and forward than down. I'm sure I'll find a use for it (like taking the dog out at night) since it does provide lots of illumination and is hands free. It just isn't what I was hoping for. A good reading light seems like such an easy thing to design. Back to the drawing board. I can see the collection I will have amassed when this search is over. It reminds me of the time I was determined to find punchy decaf coffee that didn't cost a fortune and didn't taste like decaf. I bought one can of every single decaf in the local grocery and drank my way through them. The very last one of well over a dozen was the cheapest AND tastiest: Goya. I hope it doesn't take that much effort to find an acceptable reading light."
5,Love it!,I had a light like this quite some time ago and it got misplaced. I loved it and mostly used it when I traveled. It was a treasure especially compared to to clip on type reading lights I had tried to use before I found this one..I was very surprised to find this one at Amazon. I was looking for a light to use when reading my Kindle. It is exactly what I needed. I was thrilled to find it to replace the one I lost.The hands free go anywhere feature make it very user friendly!
4,Great Little Light,"It is a tad bulky and it does carry the weight of four AA batteries, but it beats any other book light out there. It doubles as a flashlight and is especially good for doing things in the dark because you don't have to hold it."
3,Great music by talented musicians; less than quality vocals.,"Wonderful renditions and arrangements of some of Bob Wills' classics by obviously talented musicians. Regrettably, some of the worst vocals I have ever heard.... I knew Bob back in the early sixties...he would have patted his foot to this music, but he would not have sung along."
1,Very unhappy with purchase. Want my product!,The DvD i ordered is a fake! It does not work on any dvd player. This person is a con artist selling fake dvds online.
3,Entertaining novel on an incredible stock,"This book is a novel on one single stock (Taser). The author tells how this stock made a spectacular way up and tells the story of people who were involved buying it. This stock move was done in a strong bull market back when technology stocks were rising to the moon.The protagonist is a stock analyst for a bank who has to analyse this stock. The whole book is centered around his findings and the conversations with other analysts. I was actually suprised to find out this was a real novel book on a stock, unlike 99% of the other books on stocks/investments. Like another reviewer remarked this book will give you a perspective on how stocks are approached by stock analysts and speculators and the investment banks. Certainly worth reading.People who are familiar with growth investing (and CANSLIM in specific) will certainly like this book."
2,"Entertaining, boring, amusing, tiring","I was hoping the author would share his trading style in more details but that was not to be. Although, one can extract part of his trading system, the meat and potatoes is left out. I have traded successfully for many years and have found most narrative books on investing to belong to two categories: educational or amusing. Unfortunately the author fails to educate the user on why and how he trades and loses his audience half way through the book with long winded descriptions of the characters and events surrounding the trade.Mr. Koteshwar needs to try again but this time he needs to address the nuts and bolts of his trading style. Good luck."
5,Best Bra Yet!,"This bra is exactly what I had hoped it would be! Yay, a comfortable, supportive and pretty bra! It really looks like the photo of the model on my own body. I did order the cup size smaller anticipating that would add greater support and it did exactly that. It handled the washing machine very well, by accident it went in but it looks in great condition. The price is definitely right as well. Very satisfied customer."
1,"NOT a ""Leisure"" bra!","I received this bra yesterday, and I am returning it ASAP. My search was specifically for pullover sleep and leisure bras. There is nothing in the description of this product that says anything about clasps or closures, which I think is a little deceptive. This bra has a back hook and eye closure, which means to me that this is just another bra-not a leisure or sleep bra. This is the bra that you wear to work, then rip it off as soon as you get home so that you can put on your ""real"" leisure bra."
1,aha bra,it is nothing like how it is pictured and was not described accurately. very disappointed. doesnt even support. is uglier in person and not like the picture showed. it looks like a maternity bra with wide heavy back and eyelets that are impossible to do up unless you reverse the bra first. too hard and not worth the money.
2,Not impressed,"The photos are great, but the product left me wishing for more. The straps have no adjustments and are too short and I am only 5'3"" tall. Consequently the back rides up and the band doubles over. I feel Larger breasted women need adjustable straps and they cut corners in the wrong place.Bought 42C and the cups are more D sized. My best guess for sizing is to buy 1 size smaller than you normally do.The bra is very soft and comfortable. I do not use bras except with white or lightweight tops and this will do the job. I won't buy a second one."
3,Not a leisure bra,"This is not a leisure bra in my opinion. It does support fairly well...looks natural under clothes but I wish they'd of stated that it had hooks...ALOT of them. I'm a size 14 and the xlg is tight. Doable...but tight. Just don't care for all the hooks in the back. It is a pretty bra, I'll give it that. Haven't laundered it yet, so don't know how that will be, we'll see. I guess the only BIG negative for me is the hooks."
3,so-so,I was expecting this bra to be more comfortable than it actually is. It is okay but I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Only a pretty picture.,"This bra is not for any support. Gives you cover up only. Do not expect any uplift. Maybe if you wore another bra under it first, it would help, or if you are a A-cup, this would work as seeing some pretty lace."
3,OK,"I really have a hard time finding Bras I like and when I do I try to buy them all up because when I wait I can never find them again. So it seems I'm always on the hunt for new ones. My preference is Cotton knits because I find a lot of the materials used to make Bras are really irritating and itchy. Also I have shoulders pain so a lot of the straps are aggravating. This looked like it might fit the bill, however I should have realized the lace would be a problem. I can wear it for a couple hrs but then the lace begins to irritate my skin. Also while the straps are stretchy the armholes are really small compared to how most Bras fit. If you dont have any problems with lace this is pretty comfortable."
5,Bra,"Item arrived in the expected time frame. This bra is very comfortable and wears well, I wish I had bought several more."
3,band rolls,A different body shape might not have this band roll problem but it is very uncomfortable for me. I am considering a different style as the quality is there and it might just be my shape vs the bra's shape!
5,It works,"Good machine and easy to use. Smooth and quite. It's big so if you have no room, you may want a smaller unit."
3,Good product but arrived with some rust and bad paint job,"Finally got the box which is very heavy but good packing. Definite a 2-person job to assemble and took a couple hours, but need a few more people to move the heavy box. Just tested and ti's pretty good. But while assembling, found some parts with bad paint job and some rust."
4,good and easy,"My teenage grandson is thrilled that he can do his weight training at home. His high school only has free weights and no program. This model has everything he wants, and he can move it if necessary. We would have preferred to have the more sophisticated model, but this is a great machine for the price."
4,Taking the first steps toward true democracy,"You'll be lucky if you can keep all the names straight, and the author provides plenty of them, but it's a good look behind the scenes of a modern, peaceful revolution. It can be a bit dry at times and the author's writing style and word usage sometimes left me curious as to exactly what he meant but push through it and you'll finish the book with a reasonable understanding of the challenges faced and overcome by people who wanted a new, responsive government. They've still got a lot of work ahead of them but let's hope they succeed."
4,Three Recipes I Use The Most Come From This Book,"It's one thing to collect cookbooks-I own hundreds and use most for inspiration only. Some simply are entertaining with gorgeously appetizing photos-as one of my friends refers to as ""Food Porn""!However, I have surprisingly discovered in this cookbook some recipes that I rely on frequently. Alice Medrich's recipes have become a part of my everyday 'go-to' repetoire.I get consistent results and find her directions clear, her suggestions helpful and sound. The recipes for brownies, cheesecake and formula for ganache are excellent.As someone who definitely prefers darker chocolate, I find this book to be a tremendous asset in my culinary library!"
2,Surprisingly mediocre,"I bought this book about a year ago and have made some of the recipes and even took a pastry class with a friend that utilized some of the recipes from the book. We were both surprised at how mediocre and overly sweetened the items all were. The brownies were just okay. Poor texture, too much sugar. The meringue was too sweet. The truffles were about average in terms of taste and texture. I've had much better at Godiva. A very disappointing book for all the hype because it is so average. I feel let down as I had heard great things. The pictures are beautiful and inspiring, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for good chocolate recipes."
2,Great read...disappointing taste,"Alice Medrich writes with charm, passion and intelligence. Her descriptions of tempering chocolate or making ganache are thoughtful and encyclopedic. For the writing alone, this is a great book. But, oh, the recipes. Each one of the five or six I have tried has yieled uninspiring, bland results. The ""Tiger Cake"", a chocolate marble cake with olive oil and white pepper--attractive, interesting in theory, but bland and rubbery. The ""Nibby Pecan Cookies""--likewise bland. I could go on...but the short story is that if you like assertive flavors that are rich and satisfying, well, this author isn't for you. And that's why I give it such a low rating...because honestly, no matter how well written, if a cookbook's recipes are poor, well, then what's the point?"
2,Less than expected,"Some parts of the book are great. There's a good section on general chocolate topics, ingredients, tools, etc. And the recipes often have notes that are useful to the advanced chocolate user.But, if you like to see an example of what the recipe discusses (i.e. a photo - something that makes a big difference for me) then this book may disapoint you. While the photos are good, they are not placed with the recipes and there are not photos for each recipe. Saving printing costs by avoiding photos and by not placing them with the recipe does the reader a great disservice in this case.Finally, part of the book is more or less a memoir. I found this interesting in some cases and tiresome in others. It was tiresome when it seemed that the author was patting herself on the back a fair bit."
2,Amateur style speed metal pop,"These guys do the wall of sound quick tempo big-theme thing with a lot of vocal harmonies and dual tracked guitars. I'm frankly kind of tired of this, and it's difficult to take when the band itself hasn't matured to the point of having an identity. There are good parts, sure, it's actually kind of easy to sound good with this style. But the songs are chopped up with very hokey transitions, like in ""Don't Defend"" where they use the get soft and then get loud with the drums ramping up shtick. Then they close the song with the guitars marching bit. Yawn. Everything you expect from this type of music is here, almost like the kind of album hair bands used to put out; the rocker, the ballad, the anthem. Well, it's not their fault, they're young and maybe they'll find something worthwhile to do eventually."
4,Better than I thought,"Had to try, that way when needed, I would know what to expect. Slight chemical/iodine taste when added to water but not as bad as bleach(or from my sink for that matter). Had I used a charcoal filter of sorts it might have been better, I just wanted to see what it would be like for an emergency before the emergency arose. I recommend everyone try items to know what to expect before SHTF because then if it's awful you won't bother carrying it. Would purchase again"
5,It works,"I have had this product for sometime, but did not use it until here lately... Was forced to use it when my waterfilter stopped working on a backpacking trip.. The waterfilter issue was my problem. I had tried to use it too long and got into trouble by doing so.. This meant I had to carry the dead waterfilter for a week. But, I had taken this product with me and it worked great.. I use a lot of water, and this process slows me down, sort of, but it works.. Just takes some time for the whole cleaning process to take place... I will buy another when this one is done.. The thing I do not like is that it can be destroyed by freezing!!!!! Water stays in this thing all the time.. Water freezes.. Frozen water breaks glass bottles, etc.... You do have to keep this product warm for it to work.."
4,Just Burp,"Do not forget to burp your water bottle after filling it with water, shaking it, and then purifying the bottle neck with the iodine/water mixture.This product saved a trip in the NY Saint Regis canoe wilderness area when our filtering equipment failed.Write to the jerks who have prohibited it"
1,Just Boil and forget all these overpriced fancy items,"Boiling water will make 100% of fresh water drinkable 100% of the time. Just boil. These things are overpriced and for the price do not provide nearly enough drinkable water, especially considering you can boil it for free. Get a 1 burner propane burner for 15$ and have all the drinking water you want using 2$ propane tanks that will boil 50-100 gallons before goin empty."
4,Great as a backup water purifier!!!,I use my steripen first. Its faster and I don't have to worry about the water temperature. I do keep a bottle of polar pure in case my steripen breaks or the water is REALLY murky.
1,"No ""green dot"" as per instructions","THe instructions say that the shelf life is very long, which is why I chose this product. I am not sure if I got a defective bottle, but I filled it with water as instructed and waited for the indicator dot to appear to let me know the dilusion level for adding it to water. The indicator strip on the bottle never changed. I waited a week before sending it back. I may have gotten a defective bottle, but am now looking into the iodine tablets instead."
2,Serious Packaging Issues,I have ordered Polar Pure twice and both leaked en route to my home... Polar Pure has serious packaging issues and I'm glad I discovered this before actually needing to disinfect water.
1,product nearly gone,"The container I received was nearly empty. Perhaps 1 ""capful"" was in the jar. I suspect the product had been on the shelf a while and the iodine had sublimed. Amazon allows a refund but I must drop it off at a UPS center which is not close by. So, I must either forfeit the $13.00 or waste an hour of my time returning it. My advice is to exercise your judgement when ordering things on line which are essentially perishable."
1,product has short shelf life,Product evaporated in storage. After a few months most of the bottle was empty and I could see residue and smell from product reacting with the air.
1,loose crystals,"I bought this, the rystals fell out the very first time, and the purifier is ruined, and i cant return it because it has been over 90 days since my purchase... so wack"
4,"I think this is good, but a bit complicated to prepare","Length:: 1:21 MinsI have little to no experience purifying water, so I'm not sure if this product is best for me or not yet. Right now it seems more complicated than it should be, but it has motivated me to educate myself further."
5,More greatness from the King,"I began my quest for Krby collector about a year ago. I found the Jack Kirby Collector Collected Volume 2 at a used store. I became addicted. I ordered all of the Volumes Amazon had. I pour over them costantly. Each is filled with greatness. Orignal Kirby pencils,articles,interviews. If you love Kirby or just comics in general then check these books out!"
1,"bad map, no intelligence at all","I have the PPC version of this(DELL AXIM30), nothing but disappointment. Not sure if the PalmOS's better.pros: 3d looks fantastic.cons:1)i was going down I-5 toward LA, and the software kept telling me to go back north because it chose to go another route. It didn't correct itself until half way between LA and SF.not to mention small streets.2)require frequent rebooting. it locks up a lot! if you turn off and on the Bluetooth, or turn off/on the PPC, everything need to be reset.Right now i just leave it in the car, not using it. My wife don't trust it at all. what a waste of money.Probably I will try the other brand (software) on this receiver and see if it's better."
1,This is not compatible with Palm Tungsten T5,"I purchased this Navman from Amazon. The Navman literature states that it is compatible with Palm OS 5.0 and higher. IT ISN'T !!! I have the Palm Tungsten T5 which has Palm OS 5.4.I have talked to people at the company and they admit it isn't compatible with Palm OS 5.4. Also they have no idea when a ""fix"" will come out. They seem to have a don't care attitude. DON'T BUY THE PRODUCT."
5,Now more than ever / Not Since Walt Kelly,"The single finest political cartoon image of a politician and the winner of our national ""gut feeling"" awareness award goes to Herblock's Richard Nixon rising from a casket with his dracula cape, fangs and 5 o'clock shadow just below the hands holding the wooden stake and mallet.No, Nixon was still alive and kicking when Herblock did that commentary. He was trying to become an ""elder statesman"" and given his political history of rising from oblivion -- Herblock had him and us dead square.Walt Kelly (Pogo) and Herblock were the seminal political cartoonists of the middle of the century. They are missed.This -- all too short -- book covers the only a few highlights out of a 50 year career. Buy the book. Herblock is gone, but his insights will not fade.GRO"
1,Graham & Herblock invent the self-licking ice cream cone,"Herblock is old and in the way. His cartoons are not funny, are of low professional skill and epitomize the cheap shot of politics. Katherine Graham thought they were funny, I'm sure there are people who agree with Herblock's cartoons. This goes to show it takes all kinds and that poor taste will always be with us. Probably the poorest (best) example of Herblock's ""art"" was his memorial cartoon to Katherine Graham. It was the most mawkish cartoon I've ever seen and definitely shows how much he deeply appreciated her lack of control of him. The Washington Post would be a far better newspaper and journalistic institution if these two had never existed."
5,RIM BLACKBERRY SNAP-ON COLORED CASE COVER,"This itme is great! It has saved me many times from destroying my Blackberry after a fall/kick/drop. :) The only thing that disappointed me was the color. I am a purple fanatic, and this case looks very purple on the website. However, when it arrived, the packaging said purple while the color was more of a light pink....maybe a very light lavendar. Nevertheless, it's a great buy if you want the protection and are not worried too much about the exact color."
5,just for fun,"This is one of the funniest books I have seen in a long time. It's just got some hilarious excuses, and it has excuses that people have used on me. It's just a riot to see them all in one place, and, if I ever get in a sticky situation, maybe a good excuse is just what I'll need!"
2,Not Enough Pop,I was disappointed with the selection of songs. There were better songs to choose from when this was created and they weren't included.
1,not so good,"we bought this mobile for our 2 month old after reading the reviews, but returned it next day. ONE it is FAR MORE then 10-12"" away from his face! And even though the mobile does pause for a baby to focuse, there is really no point to it since he can't really see it and looses interest in it in about 30 sec. We tried to adjust the mobile lower, but IT DOESN""T FIT into standart cribs, like it says on the box. SECOND the music was o'k. It will not put the baby to sleep and it will not entertain him either. Just make him bored. The white noise, however, is nothing like ocean waves, it is more like modem connecting. If you want to get ocean waves -- get fisher-price. THIRD WE HAD TO GO THROUGH 5 MOBILES BEFORE WE FOUND THE ONE THAT BATTERIES WOULD FIT IN. In the other ones the batteries would stick out not letting you fasten the cover. THAT IS A MAJOR DEFECT. ADVICE -- BUY FISHER-PRICE if you want your baby to sleep, TINY LOVE -- if you want him to DEVELOP. DON""T BY THIS ONE!!!"
3,An Engaging Mobile,"I think my daughter would give it a 4, I give it a 2, so we split the difference! My 6-week-old loves it on the ""white noise/waves mode""-she actually smiles and laughs at the simple shapes and it's so fun to watch her track the figures. It holds her interest more than any other toy. Neither of us enjoy the musical settings, which are both obnoxious. If she is fussy, the music really makes her ""lose it"" at this stage. I think it's ugly, but I've come to accept that a good nursery shouldn't be about mom's taste, but about what works for Baby."
1,What's that dang noise!!!!,"Well, I've had the product home for all of 30 minutes (the entire time spent putting it together) and now I set it up on the crib and turn it on and disappointment sets in. The motor makes this grating clicking noise!!! Even more annoying, it will make the noise for a minute then act like it has stopped, only to start again. The toys are cute and I am really upset that it has this MAJOR flaw. So I guess we are headed back to return it, lots of fun at 37 weeks pregnant!! Why can no one make a battery powered mobile that works?!?! We can send people to the moon but a mobile that works on any premise other than wind-up is apparently too complicated :("
1,Ugliest thing I ever saw,"Tell me where can I find that engineer who created this thing?1. The 'sound of sea' is much closer to sound of modem connecting to internet2. It doesn't ""fit most cribs"". I thought my crib is non-standard one. But after a little check I found that only about 20% of cribs are suitable for this genius construction.3. Even if fited well its much higher than 10"" from the baby's face (the distance a baby can see)What else can I say. I think - it's enough."
5,The best mobile out there,We had received 3 different mobiles as shower gifts and this one is the only one that faces the child. We put it on the changing table for something to look at instead of a boring ceiling. My son loved it from the start. A nice feature is that it turns and then stops for a second so that babies can focus on the objects. We also love the way you can change the items to make the mobile age appropriate and for a change of atmosphere. No matter how we change it my son looks for the happy face and smiles everytime.
2,Sadly disappointed,"The mobile is attractive and the pauses in rotation are nice. However, the remote control only ever worked to change the music or turn off the mobile once it was already going! We really wanted to use it to START the mobile from the doorway. Also the white noise was so much quieter than the other settings so we has to manually change the volume if we wanted to switch from lullaby to white noise etc. Overall I am not impressed."
2,not really wall-mountable,"This mobile is great -- but only if you don't need the wall-mount feature (which we do). The music is soothing, the remote control is handy and the interchangeable toys are a nice bonus.However, the packaging says the mobile is wall-mountable. That's misleading. If you mount it on the wall, the mobile will not rotate -- and what's the point of that? Also, the music box will not mount to the wall, either, but it will still play if you have it on the counter or on the floor.We wanted a mobile to mount on the wall over our bassinet and we're having trouble finding one that fits the bill."
4,"Great Mobile, Bad Remote","The mobile itself is wonderful. My 2 month old son loves the music and the pictures on the mobile. My biggest complaint is after two months the remote has broken! This makes it harder to sneak into the room and start the mobile without the remote. The remote was one of the major reasons I had purchased this mobile. Otherwise it is great.*After contacting Sassy they told me that the remote is the first thing to go when the batteries are getting low. The mobile still worked fine so I wasn't sure how low they were, so I changed the batteries and the remote works. Baby still loves it!*"
4,better than the symphony stuff,"We bought this mobile after returning the ""symphony"" one. FOra remote control mobile this is 30% cheaper than the other, isless heavy and awkward. The toys can be changed around to keepup the babies interest. It also has a wall mount for putting itover the changing table (albeit, without the music box). I wishone could put up the music box and the mobile both over a changingtable. Most importantly, my 2 month old really likes it. With other mobiles he get frustated because the things keeping moving (well, they are meant to). This mobile does this stop and gothing so he can focus on the objects when they stop. Over all, a well designed mobile."
1,Help!!,"My mom and I read all the reviews on here, and after checking out the mobile in person decided we absolutely wanted this one. Once I got it home, I attempted to put it together only to find I couldn't get the 3rd battery in. Both us and the guys at the store tried their entire stock of Sassy mobiles, and no one could get the batteries to fit. We believe it's because the ""bump"" on the battery won't go over the metal bump on the battery casing. We couldn't get it in enough to even THINK about closing the compartment. Is there a trick to this, or was it just a bad shipment?"
4,Great mobile!,"This mobile has made the transition from rocking our 4 month old daughter to sleep to putting her in her crib to fall asleep on her own, a breeze! The features that we appreciate the most are the volume control, the choice of music (classical, lullabye, or white noise), the remote control (although we barely need it now that she falls asleep so easily!), and the choice of toys to hang from the mobile. The round discs have great colors and shapes, as well as marbles in them that roll around. At first I wasn't too crazy about the noise that the marbles made, but my daughter loves it! She knows that if she kicks her legs around enough to shake the crib, she can hear the marbles moving around. When she wakes up, she talks to her mobile and kicks her legs around to make noise! The music is very soothing and good sounding for a baby toy. It was definitely worth the money! We would highly recommend this mobile!"
5,The only mobile my wife likes for our babies,We bought our first Music in Motion mobile when our daughter was born in 2001 and we just bought this again for our son who was born last Friday (Feb. 16). This mobile is the only one my wife would consider buying so she is quite happy that this product is still on the market.
5,NewMom,I love this mobile. I got it for my son when he was 3 months old. He is 5 months old and this mobile still keeps him entertained. I like the different music/sound options and the interchangable characters. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a mobile that engages their baby. It's good for keeping the baby occupied and for putting him to sleep - depending on music selection. Who could ask for more?
1,Spinning? Only if you jiggle batteries,"Kiddo LOVES this mobile for the 2 days we have had it.I am torn between wondering if I got a lemon or if the mobile is a piece of junk. I love the different music, I love the toys, I haven't even tried the remote (not a fan, personally). If I open up the back and jiggle the batteries, the mobile spins - for one cycle. I don't know if this is a bad mobile or if it is a standard motor for the manufacturer. I am going back to BRU to see if I can find a mobile that spins for more than one cycle without jiggling the batteries. Wish me luck!"
2,Great Mobile that Breaks Easily,"My son *loved* this mobile. He would stare at it, coo at it, laugh - I thought it was a really great product.So I was VERY disappointed that the arms stopped spinning when my son was 3 months old. This is a common problem with Sassy mobiles, based on the other reviews here.Buyer beware! This mobile is a 5-star idea with 0-star workmanship."
4,"Cute, but a little slow.","We purchased this mobile after the one that matched our infant bedding broke. Our daughter likes the music, but the motion of the mobile is a little slow. Also, the animals and shapes that dangle from the mobile don't spin around at all. The music has a pleasant tone and has a volume control. The remote is OK, but it only works from about eight feet and you have to point the one end directly at the mobile. All-in-all, it is a nice mobile for a younger baby, but an older baby may not be as excited about it."
1,HATED it!,"Didn't know this was a ""live"" recording or would have avoided it. The song for which it was primarily purchased, ""Let's Go Dancing"" from 1982 or so... was barely recognizable, much faster, just plain stank! Donated the album yesterday to the Salvation Army! Didn't even listen to the rest of it."
1,Unsatisfactory,"While lower priced than the OEM battery, this item does not deliver value. It lasts 5-10% of the equivalent OEM battery and has had difficulty holding a charge after just a few discharge cycles. eForce has been uncooperative in attempting to replace/exchange the item for a more functional one. I wish I hadn't wasted money purchasing this."
3,third of the power battery,"For the price it's ok as an emergency battery,1/3 rd the power bars of the Canon."
3,A little redundant,"The book was good, yet a little redundant. I found myself having to force my way through to get the book finished in the beginning. Honestly, going back and forth from quote to quote to narration was a little confusing. A lot of time it was not stated who was speaking, so you'd have to backtrack to find out who was the speaker at that moment. But once I got into the book, it got better. If you're interested in Bette Davis, I would definitely recommend the book, but keep in mind that it can get a little boring, at least in my opinion."
2,This may be nitpicking but......,"I picked up this book in the library and flipped to the photo section. There was picture of Bette that was supposedly from Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte. I don't know what the picture WAS from, but it was most certainly NOT from Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte. This little bit of non fact checking caused me to not want to read it. Sloppy."
4,Feels like you are having tea with Miss Davis,"I am about 80 pages into the book and I can honestly say it is great. What I like about the book so much is that Miss Davis tells her own story and you here from a woman who has had a most fascinating life, worked hard, and who is very intelligent and sensitive. You really see the human side of her and underneath it all she has had feelings like you or I have had. I like how the writer set up the book because while reading it, it feels like Miss Davis is actually talking to you and telling you her life story. At one point in the book she talks about how brown mascara is better then black mascara. Just for the heck of it I bought some brown mascara and Miss Davis was right. Brown mascara is much better then black! So that aside, overall a terrific book!"
2,RESIST THE URGE!,"I know that most of you ""Old Hollywood"" fans will have your heart skip a beat when this book appears in the store or on-line but don't get your hopes up. This book is quite boring. No truly new information or insight exists in Ms. Chandler's biography.Much of the information in this release has been covered in other biographies and told more artfully and with more insight by other biographers.I have given this book two stars because of the photographs previously unseen by the general public.When reading the book I felt as if I was reading an amalgamation of pieces of stories and anecdotes culled from foggy memories. I just did not like it."
2,Nothing new here!,"I am surprised that the long list of acknowledgements did not include Dick Cavatte. I am only up to page 90, and already much of the book so far consists of Bette's interview with him from his show in the early '70's. If the reader was not aware, they would think that it was the author speaking to Bette, but it is the Cavatte chat show word for word. So far I am not very impressed, and I am glad that I got it from the library and did not buy it. To me the definitive biography is still Lawrence Quirk's ""The Passionate Life of Bette Davis""."
2,Check Out the Library,"Don't bother buying this one. If you are a big Bette Davis fan, check out the library. You won't feel cheated. The book is dull and shallow. Can't say I care for the author's style or her content."
3,Requires a bit too much of the viewer..,Maybe it's just me but the thread of the story was hard to follow. Certain scenes that didn't advance the plot lingered for too long. The result was a movie that didn't engage either my wife or I. It did lead to some interesting discussion afterward when we finally started to make sense of it.
1,"Demons aren't zombies, zombies aren't demons","The premise is great; the main character is very well developed. Sadly the story falls flat and the ending is incredibly weak. The auther is clearly talented, and I'll try some more of his books. This is the loosest form of zombie book though, not really zombies, instead demons, big difference. It reminded me too much of Dean Koontz books about aliens or something that are great to read and in the end you find out its God vs. satan, very dissapointing, and very stupid unless you are looking for that kind of thing specifically. Also, why have a story about demons, and then not tell much about them? And why did you have to make animals demons too? That was really over the top. Next time offer complimentary crackers if you are going to write a bunch of cheese! Either way, don't try to pawn it off as a new cool zombie book when it's not, it's a quasi-religious paranormal book, and I *probably* would not have bought it if I had known that."
3,Left with a gaping hole- my mouth hanging open.,"Just finshed reading this book. I have developed a love/hate attitude twords it. The characters were not fully developed, but that was okay. The gore factor is Excellent. But, the journey to save/find Danney kept me going...and going....the ending is what I needed, what I craved. I can't go on forever and I fear a sequal is taunting me from a far away place I am not sure I want to go.Patients is a virtue when reading the ending of this book!!"
3,Eh.,"I was very excited about this book, there was so much hype about it. I am a bit disappointed, I think so many other things could have been done to make it better. Overall, a nice read, but I kind of wish I'd waited and checked my used bookstore first, before I shelled out 7 bucks for it.Minor spoiler: Too much of an army theme for my liking. That turns me off and makes my mind wander..."
2,First Keene novel i've read....,"and as such I feel it would only be honest to preface anything I say with that. I hated this book, I felt the author didn't write anything new and the only effort he put forth was to try and top any other zombie story's gross out factor. The ending was lame. I felt the whole thing was a piece of every zombie story known and he coasted by with exagerated torture/death scenes."
2,Frustration...,"This book I thought was really well written. I got caught up in the story immediately and it was fast paced, I couldn't put it down! I loved the idea of every thing being living dead. The change of pace with the children and animals I thought was awesome. I just couldn't wait to get to the end to find out if his son was alive or not! Then I get to the end and new as much as I did when I started reading the book... absolutely NOTHING. No real understanding as to ""why"" or ""how"" or ""IF"". When I came to the end of the book I didn't even realize it was the END, I sat there flipping pages trying to find the end that was deserved... Instead I found advertisements. I was left feeling angry, frustrated and cheated out of $7.00, next time I will look for a used book first."
4,"Good characterizations, farout zombies","The Rising...is unique in it's treatment of zombies, as they aren't the ones you see in all the Living Dead movies. These are sometimes humorous but still ghoulish, with personalities drawn out like many of the human characters. The main protagonists are believable, with issues of their own to work out as the world falls apart. I loved the origin of how the zombies came about, with a pseudo-scientific background and how the character of Baker relates to it. Jim, intent on finding his lost son, is best the drawn and sympathetic. Keene is a very good writer with a distinct and compelling style. I hope there is a sequel since the book's ending is begging for one. Check this out for an end of the world, dead walk the earth story like no other."
1,The Rising,"Dreadful book. Full of badly described gore and comic book bad guys. The main characters (you can't call them heroes, there are no heroes in this book)are boring stereotypes doing predictable things. Proof that good horror stories are hard to find. I would throw this book in the garbage dump, but I'm afraid it would cause wide-spread depression among the rats and cockroaches."
2,"Take a creative writing class, Brian!","Hey! I'm an engineer who took the CLEP test rather than freshman English, but even I know that a novel's supposed to have a denouement. Keene does throw a bit of novelty into the zombie genre by adding an an adventure story (Jim Thurmond's quest for his son) and a Stephen Kingish element of the supernatural. Those who like their post-apocalyptic novels more or less rational won't find the latter appealing. Worse yet, Keene seems to have taken inspiration from cliffhanging 1930s film serials rather than from any series of novels. The story begins and ends with Jim Thurmond, but Keene leaves us guessing the ultimate fate of Thurmond and his son. An author should resolve his main character's main problem in each novel of a series. I won't bother reading the sequel to this one."
4,Exciting and gory alternate take on the zombie tale,"A pleasant surprise, this author should get more praise than he does. This was a fun read, all the best you've come to expect from rampaging zombies. Keene has a compelling twist to the all too familiar zombie nightmare and ends this book with a supreme cliffhanger. Careful!!! You might want the next book in the series ready to pick up when you get done with this one. Well done."
4,An entertaining read,"Being a big ""zombie"" fan, I bought this on impulse while at my school's book store. I Just finished this book, which only took a week. I could have finished faster, had I not been in school and working. Anyway, the book is an easy read, and quite fun. While none of the characters are particularly deep, Keen incorporates a bit of wit and humor throughout the book. The story, overall, was entertaining. As to be expected with anything based on zombies, it's quite gory. I'm starting the second book in the series: City of the Dead. I recommend this to anyone that's a fan of the genre."
5,The Rising,"This is the best Zombie story I have ever read! I love it and everyone that I FORCE to read it fall in love with it. Its a end of the world book with a zombie twist original to Brian Keene. While the zombies are not traditional, I hesitated about the idea before I read the book, its easy to get over it and makes the book so much better. Easily ONE of the best cliff hanging endings of any book. GET THIS if you like zombies."
3,enthralling,"couldn't put it down. I like all of Brian Keene's books, and this one was no exception. Buy it today"
3,Not a zombie book.,"The writing was good. However, this is not a zombie book. It is a book about demonic possession. That disappointed me."
3,Non-Traditional Zombies,This is a very non-traditional zombie affair here. Just to let people looking for a traditional zombie novel that they probably shouldn't look here...the 'zombies' can talk. Started out good but the author just kept adding characters and different stories so it became hard to juggle all the different angles. I was thinking this was a four star book at the beginning then went down to a four star during the middle chunk and I almost brought it back up to a four because of the ending but just didn't have that 'wow' factor I was looking for.
2,A bit too much of a twist for me,Well written but honestly the turn away from the usual zombie genera was far too much for my taste. It was difficult to finish as I really didn't care what was going to happen next.
4,Demon Zombies,Well written fast moving tale that puts a different spin on the zombie genre. zombies are evil so the thought of them being demon influenced is easily swallowed.
4,great twist on the zombie genre,"I loved this book, it is riveting,interesting and was devoured in 3 days.read it, love it."
4,Screams (moans) for a sequal,"I could not put this book down! I usually take weeks to read a book, but I read this on in just a few days. Now I love zombie movies and Survival flicks, so this was a no brainer for me. I got worried near the end as only a few pages left with so much left unanswered. The ending feels like you get to the pivotal part of the story and somebody walks in the room and takes the book away from you!If there is no sequal to this book I will feel that the author missed an opportunity to expand on a fascinating story."
2,It's not totally dreck... just close.,"I had high hopes when I purchased the book. The opening seemed alright, even though it did seem a little amateurly written in spots. Well... those spots increased as I read on, and my hopes were dashed fairly early on.It was entertaining, and the idea behind the story was pretty good. It's just the execution of the idea leaves a great deal to be desired.The novel was a great disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing about this book and loving Zombie tales, I looked forward to reading 'The Rising'. It wasn't long until I realized this wasn't really a Zombie book, but rather a 'Hell unleashed, evil unleashed, etc.' story. While it was entertaining, it really was disappointing in that the 'undead' are not really undead, but merely hosts for the evil entities unleashed by a scientific experiment. Once I saw that the 'undead' could operate machiny, reason and that also wildlife was affected, I knew the ending would be one that (at least for me) was pre-ordained - no survivors.I did read it fairly quickly and it was a good story - but I hesitate to call it a tale about Zombies or the undead."
2,Not really zombies... per say.,"I was pulling for the son and dad sooo much in this story that I tried to look past the weird zombie demons doing human-like stuff and throwing out cheesy one-liners. Zombie animals, zombie birds, zombie fish that can think, talk, and plot out attack scenarios = hard to suspend belief, even for a ""zombie"" book.(possible spoilers)There is no hope here. We are strung along through a series of demon zombie vs human battles (which the demons always win) and then our main characters are slaughtered one by one until all humans are dead and the world is over. YAY! I felt horrible for the little boy, who finally gets his dad back, only to lose him in part two (city of dead) and then die himself immediately after.The Keene format.Page one. Zombies take over.Page two. All humans die.The end.You just got ""Keened""!"
2,And Then.....,"This book had me on edge throughout most of the whole thing. Granted, some of this book was slow but most of it was wildly entertaining but just as the book is comming to a raging climax it just ends...bleah"
2,No ending . .,"I agree with all those who were angry about the book not ending properly. I understand he's trying to build a series and get you to buy the next book, but I was actually angry when it ended and threw it away.Find out of the boy is alive or undead--but for God's sake don't make the entire book about the quest for Jim to find his boy and then not give us some closure.It was a fun zombie-fest getting there--the writing your typical pulp-fiction quality. But I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. Enjoying World War Z at the moment."
5,Wow ! What a pleasant surprise!,"I was killing time one day in a store and saw this book. Since Dawn of the Dead was one of my favorite horror movies I bought this book for a goof. After reading it I can honestly say this is one of the best horror novels I've read in a long, long time. I could not put it down. It has great zombie action, fast pacing, horrifying vision, and interesting characters. It is a great read that leaves you wanting more at the end (I hear there is a sequel coming out in the fall...I will buy it immediately). If Brian Keene's other books are half as good as this one then they will be very enjoyable.Recommended !"
3,Fast-Paced Zombie Action,"Finally, someone has written a book to make George Romero proud! The Rising is an exhilarating ride from beginning to end. Gory fun, detailed zombies, and danger on almost every page, this was a real treat to read. However, besides a few spelling errors, I did have a few problems. I would have liked a little more character development and a little more atmosphere. A few cliched scenes aside (the gang's dialogue at the zoo and the blanket attitude of all the military), this was a fast read and I was entertained for most of it. The ending was a little bit of a letdown, but hopefully there will be a sequel sometime in the future. If zombies are your thing, this book is jam-packed with the undead. Enjoy."
3,not a zombie book,"spoilers aheadI purchased this book thinking it was a zombie book. It's not. At least not what I would consider zombies. A Demon possessing a dead body does not a zombie make. It was an ok read but I wanted zombies, not Evil Dead. don't get me wrong, I like the Evil Dead and when I want Evil Dead I will look for that. but I wanted zombies.Zombies should not be intelligent. They should not be able to think and use tools let alone drive a car and use weapons. the idea of zombie animals is cool, but again this is demonic possession.You have been warned."
1,Not for me,"***SPOILER***This book was not for me. The zombies aren't the traditional zombies, they are thinking, coherent ones capable of planning. I did not like that, as well as the fact that there were zombie bunnies and zombie squirrels. After that I put the book down and never picked it up again."
5,Brain Keene is a master at zombie horror,I loved the rising once i picked it up i couldnt put it down it was very creative the fact that the zombies could comunicate and drive cars and shoot guns was amazing reading this book was a totally different experiance than anything else ive ever read this is a book i will read multiple times
4,Quick with a Bang,"I read this book when it came out and love how it started and the entire content was great. I WANT MORE - I will have to read some of the other books out there like DEAD and the dead shall inherit the earth...I have advise my sister, brother in law and even dad to read this book. They all say, MAN what a book, if you love the zombies like they love you, wink, wink,,,bite, dig right in to this buffet of horror, great job on this book let's look for the rest of the story.."
4,Fresh Take on the Zombie Genre,"The walking dead are intelligent, wisecracking, and quick. To top it all off the animals have been reanimated. Keene has done an excellent job of putting a totally new spin on the zombie genre and picking up the horror baton from the late Richard Laymon. The action is fast and plausible and the gore level is high. Some of his descriptions are so rancid you'll actually find yourself making a face. I also appreciate the fact that he takes time to give us clues as to a reason for the dead coming back to life and more of this will be explored in the sequel. While reading this book you'll find yourself thinking of all four of Romero's zombie movies, Cell by Stephen King (which came after this book), and the movie 28 Days Later. Highly recommended for lovers of horror and post apocalyptic fiction and if you like this book you'll also want to read the sequel, which is just as good if not better."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,Best zombie novel ever written. Romero's zombies were never scarey. These are! One of the best action writers I've read.
2,Great... up until the end,"I was very impressed with this story. It had intelligent zombies, a combination of a scientific and religious explanation for their existence, as well as both likable and hatable characters. I was impressed right up until the last page, where it just crashed and burned. I don't know whether the author was setting up for a sequel, leaving the ending to the reader's imagination, or simply saying that all human efforts were futile, but I didn't like it. I expected closure of some sort and got left hanging."
4,A must read,"Brian Keene is unquestionably one of the best writer's working in spec fic today. His short works are brutal, honest and emotionally powerful...and well written, tightly structured and layered. With his first novel, Keene has kept true to his amazing skills and given us one hell of a read. Like Laymon, Ketchum and Little before him, Keene keeps the pace razor fast while still managing to create real characters. His prose is flowing, natural and as a result sucks the reader in until you feel like you're the one being chased by the zombies. But the main reason this book works is becasue at its heart it's a story about people, real people with real problems. The central character, Jim, and his journey is believable and harrowing. A must read for fans of horror, fantasy, zombies and those wishing to curl up with a really great story."
1,Zombie fish and and other Stupidity,"I was extremely disappointed by the story. Please save your money and time and don't bother buying this book. The ending was weak with no resolutions, there were a few annoying typos and the addition of zombie fish, reptiles and birds bordered on the ludicrous. It was definitely outside the standard conventions of the genre -- not really in a positive way. I am a huge fan of zombie/end of the world/etc. fiction and I was more annoyed by this book than entertained."
2,Not so great,"This book was okay, but I've read much better. I am a fan of zombie movies, especially those from George Romero. The zombies in this book are really nothing like the Romero zombies. The talk, and run, and think, and plan out things. Basically, they are just like humans except that they're evil and you have to shoot them in the head to kill them. So if you like these kind of zombies, then this book might be for you. But the story isn't even that great anyways."
1,Laughably bad,"For anyone with even a modicum of taste, this book is a waste of ink and paper. The story is pathetic, the characters are all caricatures, the sentient zombies not scary, and the animal ""zombies"" thing is just silly. Avoid."
1,One of the worst zombie books that I have ever read,I think my summary as to why I disliked this book so much has to do with the possessed talking goldfish. Without that and some clean up on the often very dry and hopeless plod of Keene's writing style it might have been better. In fact the father and son sections were rather emotional: surely the high points of the story.I will not be reading any more of Mr. Keene's work even out of curiosity however. I'll stick to fanfiction and other writers for my fix of zombie goodness. Give the writer a decade to let a little maturity creep into his style and character fusion.
2,Come on! Wrap it up!,"Okay...The Rising...had some potential. I really did want it to work. But here are the problems. First off, you are introduced to way too many military characters to keep track of. And the names, Miller, Kramer..all so ordinary, you can't remember who is evil or who might be OK. Then, we're supposed to understand why an Asian child turned zombie can't understand English (since his living self didn't understand it) but an unborn fetus can suddenly wax poetic? And finally, when they story seems to have really taken off, and the situation becomes dire, and you can't wait to turn the page to see how it comes together, the author simply stops writing.Now, I'm all for allowing the reader to use his/her imagination, but come on! Plot, plot and more plot, and then we're left to sum it all up. Won't be reading this author again."
2,Not bad... but not as good as I'd hoped...,"I got this book hoping for the zombie epic the other reviews promised, I was disappointed. It wasn't terribly written or even plotted, but the prose itself and the actions of some of the characters came off as unrealistic. I also would have prefered to see the 'fall' more directly, by the time we meet the main players supposedly a month or so had passed since the initial outbreak occurred and yet these guys were just figuring out the zombies were 'intelligent'? I don't know, just had a few notes that rang wrong for me. Like I said, wasn't awful, just not as good as I'd hoped. I'll probably pick up the sequel just to see how it all works out but I'm not jonesing for it like I'd hoped. I'll stick with Raptorman's story for my brand of zombie fiction."
2,"Amateurish Prose, Disapointed","I must begin by saying that I picked this book purely for the entertainment I thought it would provide, I wasn't looking for an inthrawling read, didn't expect great quality in the writing, but I did expect more than I got. The dialogue felt forced, and the writing was amateurish at best. It was entertaining for about the first 1/3 of the book, and quickly lost intrest, I did finish, and was most disapointed with the ending, it was just plain wrong. Now I understand the use of a cliffhanger, but there was no need for a cliffhanger and I don't want to hear that crap about how its the job of the reader to decide what happened. In the smart movies of Romero they all end with a hanger, but in those we are given a choice, in this one we aren't even given that. It just ends with a scream. It is my opinion that this author painted himself into a corner and just had to end it."
2,Blah Blah,"I will not go into all the details, but I am a huge zombie fan, and after reading ""The Dead Shall Inherit the Earth"" and the EXCELLENT "" World War Z"" I wanted some more. This book only kept me reading for two reasons. I always finish a book, and I wanted to see what happened to Danny ( little boy trapped in the attic )...Unfortunately the author steals so much from horror movies and even books (Swan Song) that it was hard to finish. And of course, the cliffhanger ending to get you to buy the sequel which is even worse. I dont know if I want to give Mr.Keene another chance on some of his others."
1,Don't believe the hype,This book has been hyped as one of the greatest zombie novels ever. Well that's all it is just pure hype. It's the same pointless run and dodges the ooh smarter then usual zombies while avoiding the evil army that is just as bad as the zombies. There are no really scary or tense scenes and the gore is also very minimal. Also no real explanation is given for the zombies. Lastly be warned this book has the worst rip-off cliffhanger setup for a sequel ending ever written. Note to the author cliffhangers and sequel setups are just fine but when you do one that basically kills the entire plot of the book it's just sad.
1,"Infantile, awful, I feel bamboozled","If you are a fan of World War Z and are looking for something in the same vein, look elsewhere. A 15 year old boy ""might"" enjoy this book, but anyone older who still does is obviously an infantilized loser who probably buys movie dioramas and statuettes, reads comics, etc.I feel utterly rooked by the reviews here and I want my money and time BACK."
2,These are DEMONS!,"I am a huge fan of the old fashioned zombies. They're slow, there is a lot of them, they bite you and you go down... yada yada yada. SO of course I was lured to this book. But people, these are DEMONs from another realm, they are NOT zombies. If you want the traditional living dead, stay away from this book. If you are looking for something new, you might kind of like this book. I say ""might"" because, besides the misleading zombie description, the book bit a little. You end up not really caring about any of the characters, they were underdeveloped, and really this book was a yawn fest (sorry Keene if you ever read this... I know you tried). And the parts that were meant to be funny, were not. If you are still interested, buy this book used, not new."
2,Just too much,"This was not a badly written book but the concept is just overwhelming. Everything that dies, men, women, dogs, birds, fish, squirrels, anything comes back as zombies inhabited by demons and attempts to eat the living. These zombies, at least the human ones, can talk, fire guns, drive cars, fly helicoptors, etc. In short there is no chance of defeating them and the book is basically a wind down of everyone and thing on earth getting eaten and becoming zombie-demons. The characters aren't bad but the concept is overwhelming. The people in the book have no chance and it makes it a depressing and ultimately unfruitful read."
5,Really good book!,"This is a really good book! The only problem I had with this book was the ending. I won't give it away but you won't find out what happenes until you buy the sequal~ City of the dead~ Which I thought was a little unfair..... All in all this book was great! Keene did a very good job of setting the scene for the end of the world as we know it. LOVED the characters, loved the zombies! Very well written.. I would definetly reccomend this book.."
5,Great Book,"A top notch, slam bang, in your face horror novel. The author pulls no punches and gives it full throttle. The Rising is an intense read, and the unexpected ending is oh so satisfying (especially if you're a fan of Dawn of the Dead or Carpenter's The Thing)."
1,Zombius Interruptus,"I was sucked in. I was caught up. The lead character overcomes tremendously difficult hardships to get to his son in New Jersey. I was even amused by the zombie deer setting a trap for the poor hunters. Zombies with an intelligence. Great idea! Then comes the end. The moment we have been waiting for when Jim rescues his son... or does he? WE DON""T KNOW!!! The author chose to put financial concerns over story telling and set himself up for a sequal, never ending the original story. By the way, a sequal I will NOT read. I was cheated. I am now reading ""The Dead"". Much better book."
2,There is no ending!!!,"Not a bad zombie novel at first,tense,suspenseful,and the uber zombies ***SPOILER ALERT***that are intelligent,organized,and can drive and shoot are great.The army guys are slumming from Swan Song,another post-apocalyptic novel.The problem really lies in the fact that THERE IS NO ENDING TO THE BOOK!! It just stops as if the publisher ran out of pages,or the writer suffered a sudden attack of appendicitus.Extremely frustrating and unsatisfying to read."
2,Simple Story with Simple Characters,"This book was a let-down for me. I was hoping for a thriller, but found it more like a kiddie ride. I like Zombie literature because most of it has undercurrents of social commentary and ethical critiques. This story was just a simple story about people trying to deal with a zombie infestation. I always held the characters at a distance, and the story never really grabbed me. The ending was the final nail in its coffin. Perhaps the story will rise from the dead? I think not."
2,Predictable and possibly the worst ending out there,I don't know if Brian Keene is planning a second book but if he is I won't be reading it.You can read the description of the book above so I won't repeat it here.What I can say is the Brain keene did manage to come up w/ a great idea on why bodies are returning from the dead. Sadly thats where any originality ends. While the premise was good Brian Keene takes things a bit to far and as a result you lose all hope for the survival of the main characters.I don't want to spoil the book for anyone so I won't go into details. Just know that this book is far better off if checked out from a library as it really isn't even worth the $7 cover price.
3,zombies by the book,"After 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, etc., etc., I read this book and found it more of the same--not bad, but I think the genre is getting a little tired. At this point I prefer something that puts a twist on the genre, like Xombies."
1,Did I read the same book as everyone else????,This book is full of sterotypes and cliches.I kept waiting for the horror to happen.Instead I started to laugh at most of the book.I don't know if the author intended for the story to be so comical but it definetely amused me.The writing style was kind of choppy and the plot contrived.I didn't care about any of the characters.The zombies or should I say demons were more annoying than anything.Zombie animals?I got a good laugh at the image of people running from zombie squirrels.The ending made me shake my head in wonder at the wasted time I invested in this book.The only good thing I can say about the book is that it was free.
1,So awful,"Compared to ""Day by Day Armageddon"" this book is awful. Poor writing, simplistic, terrible. I want my money back."
4,To Die For.....,"The Rising was the first work I read of Brian Keene's. That was 4 books ago!!! He has a great way of story telling that allows us as readers to feel every punch, hear every shot & peek around every corner along with the people he writes about. I am a hard core Zombie lover who loves the play by the ""Romero Rules"" when it comes to the living dead. But I must say...Brian Keene has writen his own rules...and I am glad he did.If you are a ""I can't put this book down"" kind of person...You better have City of the Dead in hand prior to finishing The Rising. You will thank me for this advise...Trust me!!!"
2,Not worth it,"I am an all out horror fan, and have read many books that had me on the edge of my seat, but this is not one of them. I agree with another reviewer that says it has a lot to do with the writing, it just doesn't hold up. And another reviewer who had the audacity to mention this book in the same sentence as The Stand must be insane. It has none of the three dimensional characters that The Stand has and the writing again is not compelling enough to make you even want to finish the book. I have given this book two stars basically because I did find the pregnant wife part of the hero's story interesting and new, but that's about it. And before I go if anyone wants to see a good zombie movie rent 28 Days Later, unlike this book the zombies are not slow moving ""sloughs"", makes for a more interesting and scary ride."
3,Not half bad but not great,"It's worth the paperback price for a quick read. Good premise but also illogical....anyway, the movie ""28 days later"" is much better - basically the same story but told in a more creative, intriguing way."
4,A New Type of Zombie,"I discovered Brian Keene after reading my free copy ofDarkness on the Edge of Townfor my Kindle. I enjoyed that title so much I thought I would give The Rising a shot. I love Zombie novels and The Rising features a new take on Zombies. As other readers have noted these zombies can talk, drive motorcyles, use weapons, and even the animals become zombies. I liked this novel enough to download the sample to the sequel,City of the Dead. Which I will order soon (I just prefer not to read two books in a row by the same author). I also plan to order several more of Keene novels on my Kindle (A Gathering of CrowsandCastaways (Leisure Fiction)among them). Plenty of gore, blood, and action. It took guts to write a new type of zombie story and I'll give Brian credit for trying something new."
5,Driving Hats,"Kangol driving hats are a Quality product. Shapes well to the head. The material allows for breathing. Love them , bought 3 more colors."
5,Love the old school feel,It is hard to find a good quality hat any where any more. Old school kangols are ideal for a casual look.
4,"Cool Hat, Scratchy Headband","Like all Kangol hats, this one is first rate. But the polyester headband was uncomfortable on my forehead. I had a tailor sew a cotton headband over the existing one, and now it feels fine."
1,returned,returned hat was to small fit like a Medium not a Largeeasy return process good quality just to small
5,Exactly what I wanted,It is very difficult to find this item in the stores any longer. My husband loves to wear these and at the time of my purchase they were at a very good price. I would recommend this product to any one that enjoys these types of hats. They are of great quality and maintain their shape.
2,SHOP AROUND FIRST,"amazon's color chart for these hats is terrible...unless you want a black or white hat, you might be waiting, then returning and waiting more...the color ""natural"" is yellow...also, since the hats are not size-adjustable, if you can't find a convenient store, to determine your size, you'll do more waiting and returning...i have an average size head but take an xxlarge size of these...once you get the right size and color, it's a nice hat..."
4,"Comfortable, yet Stylish","I needed a hat that was comfortable and that I could wear for different occasions. The usual wool Kangol was a little too heavy and thick. Fortunately, this summertime style Kangol I found on Amazon was perfect."
5,First Kangol but not my last,"This was recommended by a fellow traveler. I read the other reviews and decided to buy the 504. It's extremely comfortable and cool which is nice when one lives in Alabama. I also like the way it packs flat - easy to put away in my laptop case when boarding a flight. I definitely will be buying more, may go with one of the wilder colors for kicks."
2,Color faded / damaged,This hat came discolored. I distinctly ordered a white hat and what I got is a light pink hat. The color was clearly off and I am put out because this was going to be a Christmas gift.
3,Very good band!,"The way i discovered this band was when they added me on myspace as a friend. I checked out the music they had and I was impressed! Im a fan of bands like Evanescence and Flyleaf and now I can add this band to the list since Gretchen sounds similar to them.Best songs on this album are ""in the mean time""(my top fav), ""breathe"", and ""Passion"".So if youre like me with the same taste in music then check Gretchen out! Its worth buying and addin to your music collection."
5,Evanescence who??,"Imagine Evanescence, but with more edge, more Rock, better Basslines and a girl that can acutally sing and you have Gretchen!!"
2,"beautiful book, but anti-Christian","This book caught my eye at the library because it has beautiful illustrations, and the title obviously gives away its very positive view of Saladin and the Muslim faith. Given the publication date, it is not surprising that the book presents Muslims and their faith in a positive light; however, the book goes to the extreme in presenting Muslims as good and Christians as evil. Children in this age group are likely to be confused by this portrayal of their faith if they are Christians, while those of a Muslim background could very well see the current atrocities committed by Islamic jihadists as justified. Moreover, children at this age don't have the analytical skills to realize that there is more to the history of the Crusades than is presented here. In my opinion, this book may well be an excellent biography of Saladin, but given the age of the intended audience, the slant of the book gives an inappropriate message."
4,A fun and amusing view of the Avengers,"For a light-hearted whimsical view of the Avengers, read this book. There are wondeful categories that the other books just don't have. Everything from fights to a champagne count is included in this book. The authors rate everything on a 5-star scale. See if your favorite episodes are the same as theirs."
5,EXCELLENT CD FOR CAR BUFFS!,"This is a wonderful collection of songs! From Jan and Dean to Commander Cody and the Beach Boys, etc., it covers the era of auto music well. They hint of a second volume in the insert but I've yet to see one. Come on Car and Driver, let's have it! A very useful CD to get you in the mood for Cruise Nights and car shows!"
4,Rugby: Steps to Success,"This book is incredibly organized. It begins with basic skills, includes drills, troubleshooting in the drills, mistakes usually made, how to correct them, and how to tell if you're doing things right. Each chapter builds on what is learned before and gets into more and more complex tasks. It's almost like having a coach right there with you. I highly recommend it for any rubgy captain, coach or player."
2,not up to expectations,"I bought this for the dimmer, the halogen bulb and the cheap price ($11). Unfortunately the light output is so dim you`ll never need the dimmer. Not enough light for reading or cooking. I recommend the GE Emergency Lantern. It is slightly bigger but a much stronger light output. It has a compact flourescent bulb that has a nice warm color, not the white cold flourescent light or LED white light. Also very durable and energy efficient. I have two of these now."
4,Good for adjustable light dimming,"I mostly bought this lantern because of its adjustable dimmer switch, so that I could get just the right amount of dimmed light. This lantern was especially for having a light at night when the electricity goes off during a storm. Most other lanterns were too bright, with no dimming switch, and bothered my family when we were trying to go to sleep. This lantern, however, gave just the right amount of dimmed lighting so that we could comfortably fall asleep with a pleasant, dimmed light.I would not call the light in this lamp as very bright, even at maximum level of the switch. If you want a lantern that lights up an entire room very brightly, this is not the lantern for you. Also, please note that the seller will send you random colors of the lantern (I didn't see any option to indicate what color I wanted). Overall, I would recommend this purchase if you want a good, inexpensive dimming lantern with moderate lighting power."
