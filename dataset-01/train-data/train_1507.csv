5,Great MP3 player for my 4 year old!!,"I purchased this for my little girl who is turning 5 in September. She loves the Barbie stuff, so I know she will enjoy her Barbie MP3 player. I have not given it to her yet, but I did set it up and downloaded the software to the computer. While I was very disappointed that I could not transfer her/our music on I-Tunes to this MP3 player (wished someone could give me a good reason as to why they didn't make it compatible), I found some great Barbie and Disney music on her CDs, transfered them to Windows Media Player, and then it as a simple download to her Barbie MP3. I listened to it, and it sounds great for a $20 MP3 player! So, with that said, I would highly recommend this product. I""m not sure if we will get any use out of the other fun stuff that comes with it, but's we'll see come September 29th!"
4,Barbie Girl is alot of fun!,This mp3 player is very stylish looking and easy enough for a 7 year old to operate. It is a lot of fun!
4,"Love it, but save money by shopping elsewhere.",I purchased this from Ross' for $5.99 and my daughter LOVES it! Thank goodness we shopped around before purchasing!
2,Worthless,"For starters, I really dislike giving negative reviews, but this seemed necessary. There are so many things wrong with this mp3 player, but I will keep this short and to the point. No troubleshooting support. Website is very vague about problems you may encounter. Good luck getting a response from customer service. The main problem is that it doesn't work with i-Tunes (mp4)and only accepts mp3s. This would have been great to know before purchasing. Another issue is that the website is designed to have your children begging for more...literally. Go ahead and plan on upgrading to V.I.P (extra $$$) since the basic features won't keep your daughter amused for long. If you can spare the change, I would recommend investing in an i-Pod/Zune if your main interest in this product is to play music."
4,goood,this was my daughters first mp3 player and she kept up with it but never messed with changing faces on it
4,Barbie Girls MP3 Player Review,"My daughter loves this MP3 player. We haven't done much of the online stuff with it, we just haven't got that far yet, so I can't comment about that. However, she loves music and wanted an ipod for Christmas, but being only 6 yrs old, I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on an expensive ipod. This is perfect for her, she listens to it every day. And she calls it her ipod!"
1,Can't register/load product ...,"We haven't been able to register our product on the website, and thus Barbie is still sitting plugged in to the computer unplayed with. I have no idea how to load songs on it as that is a function of the software that wont load. Called customer service line and got a recorded message ""we are experiencing and unusually high call volume. Please try again later"". *click* Needless to say I have one disappointed little girl who's been borrowing her dad's ipod all week."
1,Save your money; buyer beware,"My daughter wanted this so bad for her birthday; we changed our minds and bought one for her. My husband is against Barbie software because of previous spyware problems with their software. My daughter never had a chance to play with it because of disc problems; it may have been scratched, but what do you expect when it comes packaged right up against hard plastic with no protective sleeve. The tech support was no help at all...the woman knew next to nothing about computers or the new product. The biggest laugh is when she told my husband....we're a toy company! So save your time and money, we returned this and bought her a Be-Bratz doll instead. It's half the price and all you need is a USB port; no disc to install! It's not an MP3 player, but she doesn't care, the web site is great. She always liked the Bratz dolls better anyway."
4,It's decent,"I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday in November. She loves it! We haven't even gone online to do the games yet. She just likes having the MP3 player in the shape of a Barbie and also being able to change the face, outfit and hair of the doll. There are two negatives that go with this for her. It comes with three sizes of earbuds, but all three are still too big for my daughter's tiny ears. She gets frustrated about that, because they keep falling out. I can put them in my ears fine, but her ear holes are too small. They need to include one more smaller size. The other thing, is that the hair pieces that come with it do not stay on very well. It is liable to fall off the more the pieces are changed, but that could just be this particular one. Nothing is perfect! Overall my daughter is satisfied with it."
1,Junk...I guess you get what you pay for.,"Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. It's cute with the snap-on clothes, face, and hair for the music player. But then it only played for literally about 2 minutes and stopped. We were not able to turn it back on again. A big disappointment."
2,Still can't get the CD to work.,I'm sure my daughter would love this MP3 player if we could only get the CD to load on the computer. Not a surprise though since it seems most of the kid toys that come with a CD never seem to work (ever tried a kid's camera?). Save your money and buy the real thing.
3,Ehh...,"I was excited to see that there was a CD of only the ""I Like to Move It"" song. I expected to hear the (King Julian)lemur's voice on the songs exactly like in the movie, but was dissapointed instead. The CD seems like the kind that a DJ would buy and play at raves. Also, the cover that is shown on Amazon is not the same one on the CD case I ordered. This made me feel suspicous that I was cheated another CD. On the other hand, the songs are all on there, just like posted on Amazon, so that's good, and the songs themselves are fine to listen and dance to . I am a little surprised at the other reviews people gave but If you really like dancing to remixes, then go ahead and buy it!"
5,Very touching song.,"I have been crying out for this song ever since I began liking big butts. The words ""big ship on the ocean, it's a big titanic"" really touch my soul because he's talking about big butts, and there's nothing I like more than a large posterior.I cry every time I listen to this song. I highly recommend it to all of you softies out there.PHYSICALLY FIT, PHYSICALLY FIT, PHYSICALLY PHYSICALLY PHYSICALLY, WOMAN! PHYSICALLY FIT, PHYSICALLY FIT, PHYSICALLY PHYSICALLY PHYSICALLY!"
4,Message of love and humility,"Girzone has produced a heart-warming portrait of the man around whom a religion COULD be formed without the usual unchallenged rhetoric. Although not as powerful or forthright as Richard Patton's ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"", Girzone brings to bear his novelist skills like a well practised surgeon. This is a wonderful depiction of the humanity than all men can emulate even today. The message of love and humility is as appropriate today as it was in Pilate's day. Very enjoyable reading."
5,The Real Jesus comes to life!,Joseph Girzone presents a truly personal portrait of Jesus. He takes the stories and the sayings of Jesus from the Gospels and interweaves them with his own personal understanding of who Jesus is. This is a most readable and enjoyable insight into the person who is Jesus and how He was and would be if He were around today. I have recommended this book to all of my friends and have given it as gifts. It is a most moving experience!
5,Getting To Know Him,"Is a picture worth a thousand words? A Portrait of Jesus is a book that is worth reading! It will give you a better understanding of who Jesus truly is: gentle shepherd, wise teacher, unconditional in his love for all, compassionate with the sinner and more. This portrait of Jesus is truly worth a thousand words!"
5,Nice Cap,"So far this cap is working great. It looks really nice too. The mounting brackets included are actually clear plastic with light blue coloring, not color matched chrome as pictured. It comes with screws for the brackets and it also comes with a resistor that is used for charging the cap when you install it. It does come with instructions on how to install it which is cool. The LED readout is bright and easy to read. No complaints."
3,It will do for now,This product works but not as well as I thought. Though it did improve the lights from dimming during bass hits the headlights still dim at times. The worst part about the product is lack of instructions and explanation of the unit. The blue lights look cool at night from the meter but it tends to blink a lot at times. You also will need a volt meter to check your battery so you can sinc with the capacitor by turning a blue screw on the capacitor. Instructions does not say much about this nor about how and why the lights blink. Going online to the products website does not give you much info either.
4,"Great Capacitor, Decent Build Quality","It's a pretty good capacitor. The readout spits out basically the voltage charge level while the LEDs go back and forth when it's being used and/or charged. They turn off when your system is not outputting anything. The build quality on the other hand is garbage. The circuit board isn't ""attached"" to the capacitor itself, instead it's held down by the two +/- prongs.Make sure you don't over-tighten the bolts, or the the prongs will break because they are very cheaply made. I found out that some of these (since I RMA'ed one), have manufacture defects. If you run into an issue with installing and removing the bolts, return it immediately. You'll just have more issues in the long run."
5,Excellent,"Works well, easy to install, makes a huge difference!!! Very highly recommend this as compared to it's retail counterpart at $150 easily."
5,great,"Great capacitor I have a hifonics 12"" sub and hifonics amp running with it and its perfect easy to install"
3,defected product,"defected product,one of the items that i got from you guy as soon as I tried to hook it up one of the bolts broke off now I cant use it."
5,no problems at all,i really like this capacitor gives it that extra bass and stops dimming but my amp still goes in safe mode if i turn it up to loud. but that could because im only pushing 600 watts maybe i need to get a bigger amp. but thanks power acoustik i love this capacitor
4,Fast Shipping!,"The Good: I ended up getting the cap a day before the earliest delivery estimate, so that's always a good thing. Everything was included in the package down to the warranty documentation from Power Acoustik. Seems like a pretty sturdy made componentThe Bad: Only downside was that the mounting brackets are made from a fairly cheap plastic, so I don't know how well they will hold up"
3,"Good product, few problems","For the price the capacitor works well and isn't oversized like some of the other cheap ones. One thing that I can't stand though is that when it recharges from the battery it flashes very bright blue led's illuminating the inside of a vehicle. The voltage display is usefull, just don't get why they gave it blue strobing led's. I'm paranoid that i'll get pulled over at night for impersonating a cop cars flashers. Other problem is it doesn't come with much for hookup. Just has two nuts,installation screws and lock washers. Would have been nice if it came with terminal ends that fit over the posts for ground and power wire hookup. Every amp I've seen the wires go into them and lock down. So for someone to add this to a system they have to go out and buy the terminals which is an annoyance because it should've come with the capacitor."
5,"easy to install, charge and helped my car!",i got two 12 inch kicker compv and a hifonics brutus 1200. my interior lights dimmed. i have hids and they are fine but my fog lights dimmed so i installed this cap charged it up and it actually helped. they still dim but barely at all noticeable.
1,Ummm... Documentation?,Please note I am rating the packaging and not the item itself. I finally opened this product to install and there was no instructions/documentation at all.. I have no clue how to install this unit. I looked on P/A's website... Fuse & bulb? WTH I didnt get any of this... Very fustrating!
3,jim,"good product, works i think. I had it in a 2003 ford mustang with light dimming issues, but i think my problem with that was more then just needing a cap. I run a power acoustik 2000 watt rms amp with two jbl 12's in sealed box. The instructions are vague but being a auto mechanic i was able to figure it out. So if your not mechanically or electrical savvy get a professional to install this item. As incorrect installation could cause a fire or the item to explode in your face. I also recommend 0 gauge or bigger wire for this item, since your probably running a 2000 watt amp."
5,Beautiful Capacitor,"This is by far the best capacitor ive owned. It lights up soo nice especially at night time. People see it and ask me what in the world is that, and that makes me feel good. Does a great job of storing energy so your car battery wont drain"
5,Great power delivery at a very affordable cost!,"excelent choise when it comes to feeding your sound system with some extra amps!.. your light will never get dimmed again, and you dont have to sell a kidney to buy this one!"
1,junk,used it for a few months in my summer car and discharged it and went to reinstall it and found a small corodid hole in the the side of it. it was looked over upon removing from the car and taken inside my home so i did not get my moneys worth out of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Power Acoustik 2.0 Farad Digital Power Capacitor
2,Unhappy,The product did what it was supposed to however one of the terminals broke when I tried to tighten it on first install with minimal pressure. It's pretty much good for a paper weight now.
4,I recommend 100%,"lo recomiendo 100% , producto muy bonito de buena caliad, vendedor rapido en el envio a venezuela."
3,saves some power but i still have dimming,"my main resaon for purchasing this item was to get rid of the dimming of all the lights in my car. my exterior lights would pulse with the beat of the bass. and my dome light dimmed so much it seems light it was going to blow. when i installed it the dimming stopped a little but it still noticeably does it. It does not at to much power to the amps, but it does add a little bit juice to the hard hitting notes."
3,Here's the catch...,"1 Farad is 1,000 watts. So how can this be a 2 Farad 1,000 watts? I feeling some false advertising on this product. Even on the package after I received this device it claims its 2 farad 1,000 watts... If it was 2 Farad it would be 2,000 watts... Now if I paid to return this product it will cost me $10, not even worth the return. I might as well use it and maybe sell it down the road or just buy another one like it and run 2 caps..Remember people 1 farad is 1,000 watts..."
2,I recieved the wrong Brand,"I ordered this Power Acoustik Capacitor with 2 farads, but instead I recieved a Cap2 by ""Massive"" Audio. I didn't bother to call back because it has 2 farads just like the one I ordered and I didn't want to wait longer to install it in my car. Also the packaging was ok. Not great, but ok. I'm not too sure if I will order from the external site. I didn't order through Amazon, I ordered through dealer cost car audio. Other than recieving the wrong brand of capacitor. The delivery process was quick and I recieved mutiple emails informing my confirmation, when it was shipped, and a thank you. Hope this helps."
3,"among Boris' less interesting albums musically, good packaging though...","A strange album of blings and blongs, punctuated by occasional vocals. The standout track is ""A Bao A Qu,"" which turns up on other Boris releases such as the ""Heavy Metal Me"" DVD and the ""Rock Dream"" CD; ""A Bao A Qu"" starts off like other songs on Mabuta no Uta, but quickly becomes a real Boris drone song, very nice. The packaging of this one is nifty, though, with multiple inlays that poke through the cutaway hole on the back, which helps make up for the disappointment with most of the music on the CD. Along with ""Sunbaked Snow Cave"" and ""Black: Implication Flooding"", this is one of Boris' dullest CDs."
5,Excellent for Corporate Finance practitioners,"Finance for Executives' is invaluable for everybody who needs to analyse companies and wants to know whether investment, financing or business decisions create value. It is written very clearly and is therefore easy to understand. It offers plenty of practically relevant examples, mostly based on one company which is being analysed in its different aspects throughout the whole book. Moreover, every chapter finishes with review problems (including solutions) and useful references. Some chapters offer appendices with mathematical proofs or additional in-depth analysis. - You will not be satisfied with this book if you are looking for a scientific, theoretical text. However, your expectations will be exceeded if you are a practitioner who wants to make an impact in a consulting or investment banking environment. - What does make this book so special? After working through it, you will be able to easily put into practice what you read."
3,Still Hunting,The wave DVD I am looking for has swells. Large swells that the scenery changes some and the sky has bird life and so does the sand. The US East coast has swells but when you get near the tropics the waves just lap.I bought both of the DVD's from Costa Rica and the sky seemed to be frozen on some of the scenes and I did not like that. The colors were vivid. The waves were lappers on these two DVD's. It just depends on what you are looking for in this type DVD.
1,This Stunk,"Sam Yeager - the truly despicable Quisling wife stealer in the first series, is now the main character. To my great disappointment, he has not been executed for treason, as he deserves.Instead of dealing with the alien invaders the way would really would have as soon as we gained a technological advantage (attack and complete subjugation of all survivors), Turtledove has us all trying to get along for some reason. The result is an utterly boring novel. I kept waiting for the shooting to start. It never does so don't bother reading this dreck."
5,Magnificent,"Having now read all 8 books in the World War / Colonization saga - I am left wanting more. What a fantastic little (hardly) bit of fiction, the characters are well rounded and likable, the sort of people you can be friends with and never be ashamed to know them.I, in my most humble opinion, would suggest that if you did not thoroughly enjoy these books that you check your pulse.Well done Mr Turtledove, please continue with this series of characters and this fascinating saga."
4,some resolution,"goes slow in places, with a lot of repetition, but when""the Race"" finds out what the Americans have been up to,they (and the reader) will be stunned.Covers a lot of thought-provoking topics, such as therelationship of two species with asynchronous communication.Provides a nice closure for the series, but perhaps therewill be more...pat"
3,Ok but could be better...,I've enjoyed a lot of Turtledove books over the last 16 years. This one is about what I expected but not as interesting as some others. I'm glad I read it so it tied up that story line but I whish it was more like books 1-3 in the series.
5,Awesome!,"This is a must have for anyone who follow the Worldwar/Colonization series. Humans become a match for the Race in every way, and in some the Race never thought so. 5 stars. This is a great book. It also lets you into the society of the Race, but only a bit. I can't wait for the next book, if there will be one."
4,Space Suits? Full Tails?,I plan to plow through this one just like I did the first six. But I will agree that each was too wordy and repetitious.Apparently the illustrator barely read this one.Humans wearing space suits on Home - when the Race never needed them on Earth?And members of the Race with full tails rather than the psychologically revealing tail stumps?
1,Nothing happens in this book,"This book was very dissapointing. Really expected more from Harry Turtledove. Nothing really happens in the book at all. It seemed almost as if I was reading a history book on the guildelines of diplomacy. The ending was pathetic. This book was supposed to sum everything up and it did nothing of the sort. It ended with no bang what so ever. Nothing to make you think or wonder. Nothing exciting at all.The worst thing about it was that Sam Yeager was the main character in the book. I have always hated the wife stealing american traitor and then to make him the lead in the book.. yuck!.And what was up with the Garanpo character? A total rip off of Columbo, even the name sounds alike, a subplot that went no where at all and that was not the only subplot that never went anywhere. The book never went anywhere.If you have started reading this series, do not bother with this book. It isnt worth it. Re-read the first book of the series and enjoy it again."
1,"I'm a big fan, but this was disappointing...","Basically, the story went nowhere.Nothing happened. I don't know how else to say it. Americans made it to Home in suspended animation. Home is hot and dry. The Race is shocked. America demands that they be respected as equals by the race. The Race refuses and just before they decide to launch a pre-emptive war, an American ""Faster than Light"" ship reaches home. Instead of spending years in suspended animation, the trip to home takes 5 weeks. Home, now realizing that they are now technologically INFERIOR for the first time in their history, decides not to make the attack. One of the Americans becomes Kassquit's sex partner, leaving her pregnant. The Americans go home.Uh.......that's pretty much it. 600 pages."
3,Still Not Finished !,"Yes, there is too much repition. Yes, the main character should have been whacked for his treason a couple books back. Yes, There were multiple plot lines that ended in dead ends. Yes, Yes, Yes...What I wanted from this book and did not get was a serious Lizard-Thumping.No need for a shooting war, what about an ecological one with Tosevites figuring out how to kill off the Lizard's imported flora and fauna?What about isolating the essence of ginger and genetically grafting THAT into the Lizard food source?What about having the Tosevites run economic circles around the Race's static methodoligies of production?How about diddling the weather so that the hot and dry places become hot and wet? This is supposed to be Science Fiction, is it not?This is OUR planet, Harry; sharing it is for Kindergardners.Not enough imagination here.I'm waiting, Harry."
3,I wanted more.,The book is good when you look at the whole series. But I thought it was a bore compared to the other books.
4,Ending saves the day,"I just finished this book. For about the first half, I kept thinking, boy, this guy is just going to repeat himself over and over. (That seems to be a Turtledove style point). But I really felt pleased with the second half or so of the book. Turtledove may have begun a bit slow, but he really pulled it off in the end.I think this book would have been better, if it did not have the repetition, but, for fans of the series, it comes out nicely.Now that the series has completely gone beyond our own history, and opened up new vistas, it will be interesting to see if the author continues his saga!"
2,2 paragraphs,"2 paragraphs would have summed the entire book. The repetitive reminders are brutal and take up half of the print. For example: the Race never having to deal with catching up takes up at least an eigth of the book alone. I got it the first time.Mr. Turtledove I love your work, but this was nothing more than a blatant cash (and yes, you got mine) grab. Don't let it ruin you."
2,Don't waste your money,"Another boring book by Harry Turtledove. What happened to that great writer of yesteryear? I'll tell you what happened, he sold out! Having made some money with his earlier hits he is now pumping out as much drivel as he possibly can before he's too old to write it. Don't waste your time folks on this one unless you like to read page after page of mundane meaningless conversations between characters who have no bearing on the story. Page after page of boredom, it seems that all of his work is heading down the same path."
1,R. Clark nails it,"I could write a lengthy review, but I direct you to the review titled ""Monumentally Bad"" by R. Clark. It catches everything that was terrible about reading this book.Turtledove is my second-most-read author, but this book highlighted all his worst tendencies in writing and has really put me off his work. As Clark said, even if you've read the rest of this series, this one isn't worth it. Imagine your own ending - it'll be better.Very disappointing."
3,Did not meet expectations,I was slightly disappointed with this one from Turtledove. After reading the books in the previous series I was very disappointed. Homeward Bound has almost no action in it which is what I've come to expect in these series. I liked this book but it just didn't meet my expectations.
1,UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very Big Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Really bad read! Too much psycho-babel. Lack of action. Surprise invention guessed after the Senior Researcher's second phone call.I hope this is not a forewarning of things to come from Harry's word processor. It was like he had to babel on to meet a word quota.Mickey Flynn! Mickey Finn!! Almost needed one after reading this one. Urgh?!?!!?
1,Last Turtledove book I'll buy.,"Don't bother buying this or any of Turtledove's recent books. Every negative point rasied by the previous reviewers is true, not only for this book but for all of them. Turtledove endlessly repeats himself, there are entire chapters without a point, etc.Turtledove clearly views books as a means to print money, so why write one when you can write three?"
3,Not the sequel I had in mind,"I think everything has been already said on this book in the review section. I will add my grain of salt.Maybe the World War and the Colonization series spoiled me but I was expecting a sequel with a least the same caliber of writing. With the high number of books that Turtledove is churning out these days, it seems that quantity has won over quality. I am also wondering if Turtledove writes all theses stories himself. In any case, the editor should do his job and cuts the story in half, thus avoiding all the repetitions that the author is so find of.I still had to finish the book but I am really not sure I would buy the next book in this series if it ever comes out."
1,Bloated and Unfortunate end to a series,"This novel should have been edited down by at least a half, but then it would become even more painfully obvious that nothing much happens. Characters are wooden, descriptions are repetitive, and the plot just peters out at the end. This series went on for too long and this book is a waste of time to read -- find something else to do!"
1,An exercise in monotony,"I'm a Harry Turtledove fan, and a fan of much alternate history fiction, but this book was excruciatingly boring. I am not kidding when I say that on could easlily skip 150 pages and not have missed any action or character development. I loved the series up to this point and was excited when I saw the book came out, but my disappointment after reading this awful thing cannnot be exaggerated. Warning, spoilers: For any of you fans of the series, be content in the knowledge foreshadowed in the last book that the U.S. send a ship to Home. The action while there is as barren the Turtledove's description of Home's environment. For a more interesting read, pick up a copy of Home and Gardening or 17."
3,DEBORAH SHELTON HAS TALENTS ......,SHE IS IN HER HOTTEST ROLE ....I'M A FAN SO THE PRICE 4 DA MOVIE WUZ RIGHT ....SO SO PLOT ...BUTT SHE IS GORGEOUS !!!!!
4,"More cars, courses, and variety needed.","Looking at my headline, you'd think I would give this game a 2. But the graphics are incredible and the ground is just like real. But it's not like Sega GT where you can pick from 130 different cars. All you can do to these cars are change the colors and all the confusing springs in the front and rear. It has also 6 available courses and 5 hidden courses which are all lifelike and all real. But this is more of a simulation game than an arcade game. And that was the most important part of my review."
1,Murdock's review,"The game has good graphics, but the game play... how can I put this........it sucks and. you cant even change views."
2,I can't stop crying!!,"I absolutely love racing games, and I've never given bad reviews about a game before, until now. I was heartbroken when I rated this game 2 stars (the graphics and my passion of racing games had keep it from being given a 1 star rating). The game is not all that bad, it is not all that great either. The racing needs more speed, it feels that I am racing in slow motion. More cars to choose from would be nice, and along with more courses. Is that so much to ask... (I'm getting teary eyed again)."
3,"a good read, albeit dated","The book shows its age (originally published in 1932) particularly in its assorted generalizations about Indians, as well the inclusion of an unnecessary and unbelievable tangent to tie the story to then-President Andrew Jackson. Still, I found the book worth reading for Meigs' engrossingly detailed descriptions of logging on the Mississippi, for the story (likable but far from saintly protagonists) and for its themes of perserverance and devotion."
3,Not that bad,"I read this book some time ago, and while I have no strong emotional impressions of it, the book wasn't that bad. In fact the plot itself was masterfully developed - a true characteristic of Newbery Honor books. But I felt the story was a little difficult to follow and I never attained much interest in Chris, the main character. I'd tell my own nine-year-old to wait a few years before reading this one - it requires a certain amount of patience to get through."
1,Be aware! This is exactly the same workout as Total Cardio Body Toning!,Be aware! This is exactly the same workout as Total Cardio Body Toning just with a different title. I bought two DVDs based on the title thinking they are two different workouts and very unhappy to find out they are exactly the same. Should this be allowed at Amazon- repackaging the old tape and sell it under a new title as a new product?
1,not for advanced,"I have two rules for exercisedvd's first I always rent them from the library first to see how I like them before I buy, and I always read the reviews on amazon after I have done it a few times. This exercise is not for the advanced exerciser, I barely worked up a sweat, that said this is the first I've heard of her and I liked her voice, and her approach. jillian et al screaming is not my style, and i loved the yoga. I recommend anything by jari love for the truly serious, and steve ross for yoga"
4,Good workout!,"I like this tape a lot - great workout - however if you are in decent shape add 3 - 8 lbs weights for arm work. Great ab work - nice scenery - very likeable host. Great yoga cool down - I would by more of Tanja's dvd's. Not too much instruction which irritates me about workout videos, after awhile the technique is figured out???"
2,"Not for beginners, too much yoga",I am not a fan of yoga so I don't like all of the yoga on this DVD. The poses are not for beginners so be careful and don't push yourself too hard. This is an extremely intense workout that is not for a beginning exerciser.
2,another iLife,"I am not going to buy any more iLifes, I believe they are just about useless and cost too much. My other software applications take care of everything, so iLife is useless. Apple is making some big bucks off of these things. Wake up people! There are better applications out there for the MAC."
5,"Painless installation, Great improvements","After all the hassles of upgrading to ilife '05 and corrupt iPhoto librarys, I was leary, but I bit the bullet, and I'm glad. All of Apples improvements to this essential software shine. I especially appreciate the improvements in iPhoto and iDVD's ability to handle widescreen DVDs now. iWeb is great as a version1, can't wait to see it evolve."
2,Lacking some important functionality,"I bought iLife primarily to get iDVD so that I could take some video clips and put them on DVD. iDVD is a bit hard to use and not exactly intuitive, but the killer for me is that it will not let you pick the output drive, rather it defaults to a particular drive and won't let you change the drive. In my case it defaulted to the internal CD-Rom drive which won't write a DVD. I've done a lot of web searching for a work-around, but found none. There are a number of ""maybe"" this will work solutions, like hold the control key down when you click burn, but none worked for me. The end result is that the product is useless for me. Also, iMovieHD won't let you pick a temporary drive and given the potential size of the files you are working with, this seriously limits you ability to use the product unless your main drive has lots of space. All in all, I would say that the products in iLife are little better than what you might find on the web free."
5,Great Update... Especially for Podcasters!,"If you already produce a podcast, or are thinking about creating your own. Give this new version of iLife a whirl. The updates and new features alone for GarageBand will solve many of the first time podcasters problems! Wish I had this when we started mine back in 2004! :)"
5,Upgrading iPhoto,"I was having trouble with iPhoto performing very slowly and even crashing. iLife upgraded the program, which now runs very fast with no problems. I have not yet used the other elements of the program."
2,not worth the effort,"buyers beware...back up your photo library first! i stupidly assumed that this would be a simple upgrade, but because iPhoto'06 could not import a few photos that were locked, it didn't import ANY of them and i had to do it all manually. with more than 12,000 photos, this was a BIG pain. plus it imported duplicates, so i had to go through and manually delete the copies. even bigger pain. plus, i lost all my albums...huge loss. the iPhoto program touts ""blazing performance"" but i've found it to be rather sluggish. there are some cool new features, like the effects palette, but overall i would say that unless there is some feature that you think you can't live without, don't bother upgrading. it certainly wasn't worth all my trouble."
2,Apple iLife 2006 for Mac review by jac,"I found iLife was good, but I was expecting more online backup spacethan was offered. Perhaps I need a little more time to work with it."
4,I am 11years old and have been riding for 4years.,"I,personly, liked it. I would not recomend this movie for people who already know alot about horses. This movie I would recomend to people who love horses but don't know that much about them. Like the kind of horses and the gaits of a horse.The movie told a breed or a gait or a mood etc.all the way from a to z. I hope you enjoy the movie"
3,Good enough to keep me awake after midnight,"This is a very good book by my favourite tennisplayer ever, because it was written by Martina I bought the first one. But because it's a good book I bought the other two. Very entertaining and good enough to keep me up after midnight to finish reading the book"
2,A Disappointing Sequel to Total Zone,"Ex-Tennis Pro Jordan Myles is back and she's using her detective skills to investigate the death of young girl who worked for a sleazy sports agent. The action gets muddled with far too many characters (and not enough suspects) to keep track of. Then more people start turning up dead, and Jordan's life is threatened. When she finally figures out whodunit and why, there's no real surprise and the story ends very weakly.Not even the return appearance of detective Noel Fishburn (aka ""The Fish"") and Martina's extensive knowledge of the pro tennis could help pull this story off!"
2,Another Missed Serve,"Once again Martina and Liz serve up a droll tennis mystery. Very standard stuff. If not for her name, Martinia would never have gotten this book to press. Too bad she didn't pick up some tips from Rita Mae Brown when they were an item"
4,"""T"" Bolt","I am a licensed Electrical Contractor. I found that 60lb ready-mix is easier to pour bags of Ready-Mix into the Drum. Pouring cement is very easy.The Drum is held to the motor by a single ""T-Bolt, Washer, and Lock washer"". Hand tightening of the ""T- Bolt"" is not sufficient. I found it convenient to use a ""T-Bar""; normally used to turn off in-ground Water Main Valves. I don't have to reach into the Drum to tighten or loosen the ""T-Bolt"" and I better torque it so that it does not loosen while mixing.I reversed the Bolts and Nuts holding the tins so that it will be easier to remove the Drum Tins later with a socket wrench. Also this installation will prevent wearing to the nuts. Mike"
2,Great concept at the first glance but does not pass the test.,"I was attracted to the concept of the dual use of this device being wheelbarrow and and concrete mixer. As always with ""Jacks of all trades"" it is a master of none.If I was buing one again, I would go for a full height mixer and use a good wheel-barrow to move the concrete around. The wheels are so narrow that moving it with a load on grass, dirt anything uneven is impossible. I replaced them with bigger pneumatic wheels and it helped a lot but a regular wheel barrow is better. The bottom back supports make it impossible to avoid spilling concrete all the way to the destination.The second big problem is related to the emptying of the mixer. It is great for pouring footings etc. but when it goes into anything above ground level it is impossible to empty it completely. I had to dump the concrete on a piece of plywood and shovel it.It appears a great idea at the first glance, but traditional design would work better."
5,"Great, Inexpensive Little Communicator","We have several of these little communicators, and we love them. When my husband is outside or in the hangar, I can talk to him when I'm inside the house. We also use them when we're both inside. It beats yelling when we're on separate floors. We have additional sets at our weekend cabin where we sometimes have quite a distance between us. I have no idea if they actually reach 2 miles, because we don't use them in that capacity. We have owned several other communicators, and this is our favorite for our particular use. They don't eat up batteries like some of the others did either. I would definitely recommend these to someone whose needs are similar to ours. They're excellent for that use."
1,Sorry I Bought It,"I am using Win XP Pro and RecordNow Deluxe 6.5 with record engine update 1.6.14.507. Previously, I was using the Veritas version of RecordNow that came with my Sony CD & DVD burner. Sonic's RecordNow does not see any files previously recorded with the Veritas version. I could live with that, but what is not satisfactory is that if I record on a CD or CDRW using Windows, RecordNow does not recognize the CD or CDRW as recordable medium. Conversely, if I record on a CD or CDRW with RecordNow, Windows can no longer record on the CD or CDRW. I am not using DLA, nor was I in the past."
1,"I never received the product, and no communication from Amazon.","I never received the product, and have no communication from Amazon that they will either credit me or send the product to me."
3,Handy but large,I bought these to use to flip food on the barbeque. They do work but are very large. I am use to my older smaller ones. These work fine it just takes time getting use to the size.
4,Fishing anyone?,"Initially this game is a fun replacement to summertime fishing. You can choose from a ton of lures, over 20 different ""fishin' holes"" and test your skill against some tough fish. The graphics are ok, and game speed seems pretty realistic. The main downfall is that you do get sick of it, and the desire to keep coming back to the game just isn't there. I guess if you are really into fishing, and really into video games - then you will be really into this one!"
5,"""Wit's End"" by Erma Bombeck Kindle Edition",I purchased this book for my Amazon Kindle. Now that I am retired I have more time to read and the Kindle has been a fantastic gift from my husband and son. The book arrives almost instantly and this book like all of Erma's is very humorous. I purchased it to read during some of the gray days of winter and it really was an uplift. I read it on a trip and paused at times to read parts of the book aloud to explain why I was laughing in the car.
3,A little too choppy in its setup and delivery.,"""At Wit's End"" was the first Erma Bombeck book I read. I've been told that I write like her, so I was curious about what she had to say. I found the set-up rather choppy and her flow severly erratic. Her humor was chuckle-worthy, but I felt she was writing more towards herself, expecting the readers to fully grasp her humor. Even if you're not a wife or mother, you can still enjoy what is being said about such topics. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,Forced,"Published in 1965, the humor (and there is some occasionally) in this book is suburban, white, middle class--and strained. Really good humor grows naturally from a situation, and that doesn't happen here. Family sitcoms are never funny to me. It's the same old stuff, forced episode after episode, or forced page after page in a book.Obviously Ms. Bombeck had and may still have many fans. Just not me."
2,Color and Human Response,The last chapter of this book is informative and interesting on why people prefer certain colors. The rest of the book deals with metaphysics and psycho-babble.
2,Color and Human Response,"The last chapter of this book is informative and interesting on why people prefer certain colors. This information is helpful to know how to choose colors for interior/exterior decorating, art work, and understanding people. The rest of the book deals with metaphysics and psycho-babble."
1,avoid at all cost,"I purchased this book back in 2000 when I was a film student. I purchased it hoping to read about about the joys and pains of being a music video director, something at the time I desperatly wanted to be. However this book was filled with nothing but a bunch of low budget, no talent hacks crying about how they should of, could of, would of. At the end of the read I felt as if I was cheated out of 15 bucks. For anyone who is looking to jump into the music video game, don't read this book, the best advice always comes from those who have mastered the field, so save your money and read up on other video directors like hype williams, f gary grey, paul hunter, spike jones, just to name a few, those are the ones this book should have featured."
3,Meh.,"yeah, they are floor mats. I'm not in love with them at$60 but they do the job. If i had it to do over again i'd get them from Ford. they look crappy."
3,Know where you're going,"If you are not sure what path you want to take, this book is for you. If you do know what kind of midwife you want to be, this book will show you other perspectives. Has good information about political issues and a good history of all types of midwifery."
1,Lacked dignity and discretion for the public view,"I am a mother of seven children. I have delivered all seven naturally, so I am writing from the standpoint of having been there. I purchased this book for my 18 year old daughter who has shown an interest in midwifery. It came today. I was disappointed at many of the pictures as I began to flip through the book. It is one thing to be in a real life situation; quite another to take a snap shot for the public to view. The pictures that were objectionable to me had nothing to demonstrate that was being written. They were absolutely unnecessary.Childbirth is a wonderful miracle of our creator, and shows His glory. I think midwifery has a place especially as more and more young women are being propelled through an unnatural birth experience these days, but let's not lose our dignity or discretion. I am sending this book back."
5,Auto Ventshade 25130 Bugflector II Smoke Hood Shield,"Love the bug shield for my car.Easy installation, and true to description.great seller.will buy from them again"
1,Do your research!,"Spoto's gossipy scandalous style may appeal, but please don't form your opinions of the Windsors on his book alone--read some different authors' opinions. I found two errors in information in his introduction alone (for one, he says George IV's only child died at birth--not true, Princess Charlotte lived to marry Leopold, future King of Belgium. She did die later--but in childbirth, not at birth). Just check your information elsewhere to make sure you get a factual, balanced view."
4,GMK GOJIRA,The GMK Gojira are one of the first godzilla toys I've ever bought. Though never play this in the water because the paint come off.
4,it's all about attitude,"I have followed blackmetal from the beginning and this may not be ""one of the classics""but it deserves a listen by any true blackmetal fan.it's raw,simplistic and grim.All the thing's A good BM album need's.An eternal kingdom of fire is great.and you stay hooked.""from hateful visions""is a highlight.I highly recommend after you've exhausted all the other ""legendary"" band's."
5,Rare,"Beside being the traitor of Jezus and The father of Tutankhamen this guy produces extremely pure black metal.Innovating, pure, longlasting , this cd can be compared with Dark throne stuff. Slick production BM fans should proceed with caution."
3,needed more,I find this subject very interesting but was disappointed in this read. Found it boring and repetative quite too often. Was wondering when I was going to finish. I guess I'm bias and shouldn't judge every book on polar exploration on shakelton's book The Endurance.
4,Very well written,"Loved this account of the Franklin expedition, it pulled a lot of research together to make a compelling case for the probable cause of the failure of the expedition but gave the participants some credit for their achievement."
4,Fascinatingly morbid,I remember my 5th grade teacher having this book in her classroom for us to peruse at our leisure. The pictures still haunt me to this day. Horrific circumstances befell the Franklin Expedition...horrors that both intrigue and repel the mind. It's been a little over a decade since I've read this book. I highly recommend it to those who are not easily disturbed. Can't say I was one of them.
3,"Good book, not great","I would use this book to complete a collection on polar exploration and the search for the Northwest Passage; however, this wouldn't be my starter book. By itself, the book unravels a great historical mystery, of why the Franklin crew vanish so mysteriously. However, I rap the book for failing to fully exploit the potential tail before it. With the loss of 129 lives, abandoning the ship, and eventual cannibolism, there's a great story waiting to be told. Alas, this book does not do it. Instead, it concentrates on the archeological aspects of uncovering the mystery of why the Franklin expidition vanished, which is only semi-interesting."
1,Natural Birth Propaganda,"This is essentially a school project-style video that functions as an advertisement for home birth or natural birth without the evil medical doctor. Did you know that the ""good mommy hormones"" are dampened by epidurals and electronic objects? Did you know that midwife's are safer than doctors? Yep, true too, unless you have complications or don't mind having a little brain damage in baby."
2,So-so at best.,"It was an okay mousepad for approximately a year and a half. Every so often, my optical mouse jittered from one edge of the screen to the other when left stationary, but I encountered no serious problems.Unfortunately, it seems that might have been indicative of a greater problem with the mousepad. It is all one color. The grooves have all worn away on a large portion of the pad, and now my mouse won't budge. I'm in the process of looking for an alternative right now."
1,GS not as good as the original,"I just bought a new RatpadzGS to replace my four year old ratpadz. Compaired to the old Ratpad, the RatpadzGS is made with a lower density Cheap-O(tm) plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech G7 mouse. When using the mouse on the GS it causes the curser to sort of stutter along. Overall I would pass on this product, for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad."
4,Great read,"I don't understand why other reviews say this book was disappointing or confusing. Once I got into the book, the characters were fairly easy to keep track of and there wasn't that much about the horse world to make it confusing. I will admit, I did figure out who the real criminals were before it ended. Nonetheless, it was a great read and I read it in a day or so."
4,A good read,"This was my first Hoag novel, and I enjoyed it. I am an avid mystery reader, and as someone who grew up in the hunter/jumper horse world, I felt I knew all the characters! I will read more Hoag in the future."
3,Thank god...a real horsewoman writing about horses!,"I don't enjoy mysteries, but this book was passed on to me by a fellow boarder at my barn, so I gave it a go. While the plot was slow, (*cough* all mysteries *cough*) I loved the many references to my home State and home equestrian turf. She based a couple of these characters on real people, too, which gave it added grit in my book- good for you, Ms. Hoag.Its refreshing to have a real horse person write a horse related novel; if you're seriously involved in the equestrian world, I recommend it if only for the horse action. Now, if only more people would write realistically about horses, and the horse world!"
3,Not Hoag's Best...,"Although I generally liked this book, it isn't of the caliber of Hoag's past books. The characters are very flat, especially the lead character, Elena. Hoag tries to write her as a strong character, but fails; she confuses emotional void with inner strength. The story and its development are impressive, but it lacks the depth and color one expects of her books.I view Hoag's books as romantic suspense, as many do. Although this book is cleverly suspenseful, it isn't very romantic."
2,Disappointing,"I've read several other Tami Hoag books, but I found this one disappointing. All the references to the ""horse world"" were rather confusing to me. I also thought that there were way too many characters to keep track of. There were many potentialevil-doers; and since these characters were not fully developed, I found myself bored and distracted. The plot got very intricate, and by the end I didn't care anymore about who did what. I'm not even sure why I finished it, except that I hate to stop a book in mid-stream.On a positive note, I did like her main character, Elena Estes. She was a very gutsy ex-policewoman, but she didn't usually display a lot of common sense. You'd have to give her an ""A"" for effort. There was a hint of romance in the book between this woman and Detective Landry. I hope they do get together because they seem like kindred, but damaged souls."
2,Get it if you work/show at the Winter Equestrian Festival,"..Otherwise I thought it was mediocre.Fun to see our stomping grounds included in a novel, but generally not great reading. I will pass my copy on to an interested WEF participant, so they don't have to buy a copy."
1,lukewarm book,"If this is typical of her writing, I won't be bothering with more. Maybe her earlier books were better?"
3,Confusing.,"This is the first Tami Hoag book that I've read and I'm not sure if I'll read another. Her books came highly recommended by someone who is an avid suspense/thriller fan. I just found that this book jumped all over the place. The author makes the story confusing by having way too many characters and switching from using their first name to their last name. If you want to start with a Tami Hoag book, I don't recommend this one. Even the ending left me hanging."
2,"Confused plot, too long","This book has some redeeming points, but overall is too long and has a confused mismash of a plot.For one, the book tries to mix a whole lot of different plot threads together. Thus we have a kidnapping, insurance fraud involving horses, murder for inheritance, a serial killer, a hoax, and so on. With so many balls in the air, the author misses many, coming up with all sorts of illogial twists. Practically every single character turns out to be guilty of something or the other. Plus, the principal character has her own demons and problems, but doesn't seem to resolve them.Plus, the book is way too long (all the plot threads probably made it so). Trim off around 150-200 pages, tighten up the plot, and you would have had a good story. As is, you get a confused and tedious book, with a couple of plot twists that are not enough to redeem the story."
4,a good read,"I like mysteries and Tami Hoag writes good mysteries. The story flows, the characters seem to be real people not gross exaggerations and you enjoy the flow.This is a good book, one that mystery readers will enjoy.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Dark Horse,This book was much better than I had thought it would be. The twists and turns kept you guessing about who did what. Especially good reading for horse lovers.
4,Huh?,"I really like Tammy Hoag's novels, and this was no exception. I have to agree with other reviews that the main character, Elena, is a little too much at times. But, the plot moves along and I found that I couldn't put it down.One problem I had was when Elena first went to the Seabright house and ended up meeting Bruce. He practically throws her out, and then a couple of days later, she goes to see him in his office, and they procede to have a conversation like they had never met. I paged back to see if there was an explanation for this, but didn't come up with one.Otherwise, I'd recommend this book for those murder mystery fans out there."
4,The horse industry sure comes up with surprises.,"I like Tami Hoag. The book does grab you early on, but tends to get too detailed along the way."
4,a good read,"the story about horses did not appeal to me that much but what i really like about the book is how you are drawn to its emotion..i really felt all the anger and resentment that elena estes felt in this book..hoag has a way of writing that draws you to the character and the emotions it is feeling just like her book, a thin dark lineit was a great read desptite the horses"
4,I was not disappointed,"I rented this book from my digital library and was pretty happy with it. I think it was only my 2nd Tami Hoag novel, but I do plan on reading more. I can understand how some might not like the characters, but they certainly grew on me. It may have been a little long, but still only took me a week or so to read. I usually only give 5 stars to a book that I would re-read myself, which I probably won't with this one, but I would still strongly recommend this book to anyone."
3,Review: Dark Horse (Audio),"This was a case of multiple mini who-done-its that came together at the end (but not in a neat little bow). The story started off slow but ended well. However, this audio was kind of a waste of time. I think this book would have been better read rather than listened to. Things finally got interesting around hour six and the ending was absolutely crazy! I was worried that the ending would be rushed because there seemed to be so many lose ends, but the ending was the best part. It was interesting, surprising, and the pacing was great. I was not a fan of Beth McDonald and will try to avoid her if I continue to listen to audiobooks. She wasn't horrible but she had a rather smoky voice that didn't adapt well to the different characters."
3,Is he slow or is he just stupid?,"Nothing beats the feeling of playing your favorite bikers -- Mirra, Nyquist, etc. The moves are amazingly true to form and the soundtrack gets the blood pumping. The controls are easy to understand and adapt.But one thing that no one has mentioned is that this game has some major lag when there's lots of stuff happening on screen -- whether it be a speeding train, or a gaggle of ramps and intersections. I can only compare this game to that of Tony Hawk Pro-Skater, and no matter how fast and crazy my moves are in Tony Hawk, the game never slows down. Well, Dave Mirra does some weird annoying slow-mo effects.Which kinda makes you wonder, is he slow or is he just stupid?"
2,Not very good,"The graphics are terrible! If you liked Tony Hawk, maybe you'll have fun with this, but keep in mind that this game did not get any noticeable improvement over the Playstation version... which was not that good anyway."
5,Great for freezing baby food,We make our own baby food and freeze it. This was a great buy and yes it is just a ice cube tray with a lid but it is so nice that it is in one oz measurement so all you have to do is pop out the number of ounces you need for each feeding. I bought two and I plan on buying more.
4,Works well for me,"I think these work really well. I bought theOXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Greenand these, plus theVital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack, and like all of them. The Oxo's are a little easier to get out b/c the bottoms are rounded, but the Fresh Baby trays still work well. I have noticed that more watery foods stick more, whereas certain foods pop out easily. Either way, I'm usually emptying the whole tray at the same time to bag the cubes, so I can run just a bit of warm water across the bottom if I need to help them slide out. I haven't had a problem with the lids - just make sure to visually inspect the lids to ensure you have it tightly sealed all the way around - the sides need to be mashed down pretty good. I hand-wash mine."
4,Does what it says on the tin,These are fine they could seal better but I have had no spillages so that is fine. Am needing 2 cubes per feed but good you have the flexibility without giving your baby too much and having food left over. A practical but not perfect design.
3,Not Quite 1 oz,"These cubes are not quite 1 oz, I would say more like 2/3 oz. Therefore you need to dethaw a number of them before you get to your desired quantity. Also, the cubes are shaped larger than most bottle openings. Because of these two issues you need to dethaw in another container, then add to the bottle. I was hoping that you could go directly from the tray/freezer package to the bottle but was mistaken. However they freeze just fine, but can be a little hard to get out since the tray doesn't bend much."
1,Ice Cube Tray with Lid,"This product is just simply a standard ice cube tray with lid, only with smaller rectangular ice cube compartments. Each cube compartment only holds 15ml, not 30ml as advertised.When I received these trays in the package of two, one was defective from the start. The lid would not seal onto the tray before freezing. The plastic on the lid was somehow defective and after trying for 30 minutes to get the lid to stay on the tray, I gave up and returned the product.If the the lid actually stayed on, and each cube compartment really held 30 ml (not 15ml), it might be a good product.I'd advise that you just buy a regular ice cube tray or a silicone one from Ikea and use that."
3,Okay,The lids warp even if you hand wash and dry them. They do allow you to cover your home made food but sometimes the frostbite still seeps in after a week.
3,Sweet and sour,I like the product...and there aren't many choices in the realm of baby food ice cube trays. But the lids! They don't stay on in the freezer and I have to put rubber bands around them.
3,any ice tray,any ice tray will do- but this still works for foods (puree veggies/fruits). this is just a regular ice tray- you can find ice trays anywhere.
3,Expensive ice cube trays,"The lids are nice, but I just pop out the food and store it in a ziplock bag. Food comes out easy, but honestly found them to be overpriced ice cube trays. I wouldn't buy again for the price. The lid isn't worth it."
5,Great product!,"Just got this today. Already made some pureed apples. Froze them in this, took the blocks of applesauce out and stored them in a ziploc labled with the date and contents. Perfect!! Exactly as expected."
3,Yep - their Ice cube trays...,"I marked these (3) stars for two reasons1. If you don't WAY overfill each cube, two cubes equal about 1.3oz not the advertised 1 each. Measured by pureeing a veggie or fruit than letting it melt in a Green Sprout storage container. Just an FYI but I didn't like finding out later on I wasn't feeding my baby the amount I thought.2. Lids fit only so-so.Other than that been decent ice/baby food trays easy to get the items out."
2,not worth the money,"As other reviewers have noted, the tray does not contain 12 1 oz cubes, but 12 1/2 oz cubes. The four cubes on the end are angled in and have rounded corners so they are even smaller. Granted the packaging does say ""approximate"" but being off by 15 ml is not close enough to call approximate in my book. Having 1/2 oz cubes does not necessarily bother me, what does bother me is the inaccuracy of the product description.As for the product itself, I purchased it to freeze breast milk so that I could place exact portions into storage bags. When I first opened the trays I was pleased by how sturdy and heavy they were, but after using them I have found that I should not have been pleased. The plastic is so heavy it is impossible to get any flex. The only way I can get the cubes out is to run warm water over the bottom of the tray. Partially thawing my breast milk to place it in storage bags is the last thing I want to do."
3,Not so happy,"My product arrived early which I was happy about because I was eager to start making my own baby food. Unfortunately to my dismay, one of the trays arrived and was cracked. I couldn't get in touch with anyone at the company and ended up being on hold for so long that i eventually just gave up...and I'm a really patient person. But when you have a 4 month old girl and you're a new mother, it's kinda hard to spend such an excessive amount of time on the phone for something like this. I would give this product a 5, but due to the broken tray and horrible customer service, i'm giving it a 3, though the customer service should be rated at 0."
1,Difficult to take out the food cubes,Ice cubes trays are better than this product. It's a big task to take out the food cubes from the tray.
4,Good but would prefer a 2-oz/cube tray,"I bought this in Amazon after comparing prices in other websites. I am happy with the trays in terms of the material they're made of and the design. However, if I was to do it again I would buy trays that can hold 2 oz/cube, as opposed to this ones that can only hold 1 oz. It would be more convenient for me. I've seen quite a few in our local grocery store and the price is lower. But again, these ones are cute and do the trick, it just doesn't hold enough food."
4,Ice Cube Trays ... made safer,"Not a week has gone by since we purchased these that they have not been in constant use. Making our own baby food takes considerable effort, but these trays make storage a breeze. We use a baby food mill and freeze the ground-up food. Banana ""cubes"" can be put in a warm bowl of oatmeal ... and our 1-year-old loves it.There are a few minor issues we have enountered. As others have said, the lids do warp. Some of ours have, some have not. At times, the cubes can be difficult to remove immediately after removal from freezer; but all that is needed is quickly running the underside under warm water ... or waiting a few minutes before attempting to pop out the cubes.Overall, a great product...and we love that the trays are made out of safer materials than most other ice cube trays."
5,what you'd expect in an ice cube tray,"Not much to say...it's an ice cube tray and does the job. I liked that it was BPA free and that's why I bought it. I like that it has a lid, too. It is difficult to get the ice out at first, but if you leave it out for a minute the cubes pop right out."
1,same as ice cube trays,Do not like this product...lids DO NOT STAY ON from the moment i un-packed them. They have not been in dishwasher. Also very hard to get frozen cubes out. I will no longer use this item!!
2,Broke on 1st use,"I like that it has a cover, but the food is very hard to get out and the tray broke the first time I used it. The plastic is so hard when frozen that it becomes brittle. Still looking for a better way to freeze baby food."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I bought this item thinking that it would serve as an organizer for my breast milk storage. Instead I ended up with two over-priced ice trays with a cover ! You are much better off buying breast milk freezer storage bags or containers where you can put the date, the amount and keep more quantity per unit.Do not waste your money and buy this as there are several better and more cost-effective alternatives for storing breast milk. I promptly returned this as soon as I opened the package. PS Amazon was very graceful about the return, which I appreciated."
2,Not one ounce - disappointment,"I was excited to get these so I could freeze breast milk and homemade baby food by one ounce cubes so I wouldn't have to waste or defrost milk I didn't need. But I swear, even though it reads that the cube sizes are 1 ounce each, I can only get 3/4 ounce in each...which is disappointing because now I will have to use 2 to cubes to get 1.5 ounces and so on and it's just inconvenient. Make sure they are on a flat surface when freezing because the lid does not make it so the liquid stays in their own cube, would be nice if it did. And it's kinda hard to get the frozen milk or food out once frozen. :/ not sure I would recommend this to anyone sadly."
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!,"we only hand wash. have bought 3 sets. lids fit and are snug. we freeze breastmilk, at about 1/2 oz. each cube. pop what we need in the bottle and heat in bottle warmer. breastmilk bags are pricey, we get 12 cubes in a bag."
5,great product,I bought this for my daughter who makes baby food for her babies. She loves and uses it very often.
2,Just an expensive ice cube tray with a lid...,"My set of trays were given to me by someone who got them as freebies, but she didn't have a baby and thought I'd make better use of them. Certainly making pureed baby food and storing it frozen in cube form is very convenient, but I do *not* find these ""Fresh Baby"" trays to be any better than using regular ice cube trays. I do find the trays to be more stiff than my other regular trays, so I have to let them sit on the counter for a few minutes first before I can twist/flex them to get the cubes out. So far I haven't had any problems with the lids snapping properly, as some others have commented, but I also remove the food from the trays after a couple hours when it is frozen and store the cubes in another container. Since I do that, it doesn't even matter that they have lids. In my opinion, save your money and use regular ice cube trays instead."
3,Ok...but not great,"I find that these trays have a few drawbacks- The size of the cube is too small (1 oz I believe). For my daughter, who has a good appetite, it is just not enough food in a serving. For kids who are lighter eaters (my older 2 were) it may be a better fit.- The tray is very rigid which makes it more difficult to actually get the food out of the tray.They do stack well and are attractive to look at, but I would not buy again. I prefer the Kidco food storage trays."
1,Not 1 oz cubes as advertised,"I received these trays as a gift. Love that they are bpa free and come with lids, however, each cube holds only 1/2 oz to 2/3 oz breastmilk (not 1 oz as stated online and on the product packaging). As thawed breastmilk is only good for 24 hours in the fridge, this makes planning more difficult and can lead to wasted ""liquid gold"". Will not be using for breastmilk storage"
4,just as advertised,"I bought these so I could freeze breast milk. I wasn't sure if the ice trays that came with the fridge were bpa free so wanted to get something that was. Having the lid is a bonus. The only downside to this product is that even when filled to the brim each cube is only about 2/3 an oz but once you know that it's easy to plan accordingly. For just freezing breast milk, you don't really need a 2pk, but if I decide to make my own baby food I think the second one will come in handy."
2,"Good idea, but the covers pop off in the freezer","I liked the idea of these trays, even if they are just fancy ice cube trays with covers. Unfortunately, the covers don't seal well and pop off in the freezer."
4,I love these but you can get them cheaper.,"These are basically ice cube trays with a lid. People complain about the lid, but all you have to do is run it under hot water for a few seconds, then it fits fine. Definitely a good buy!Just boil baby food for a few minutes and put in food processor. Then fill into the trays and freeze. I like to pop them out and save them in labeled zip lock bags so there's more room in my freezer. This way you can create an entire menu.UPDATE: My only issue with the little slots is--they are too small, they should be deeper. Still a good product...but you can use regular ice cube trays as well.UPDATE: I was at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and saw something almost identical, ice cube trays with lids..they cost about $6. I should've just purchased from there..oh well."
2,didn't care for,I really like using the little square glad plastic tubs rather than this item just didnt like how it was too much work trying to get the frozen cube out if I didn't want to defrost the whole thing.
4,useful,"These have served their purpose pretty well. I used them to freeze breast milk, and now for homemade babyfood. All in all they have worked out great. They actually yield a little less than an ounce though. Maybe you have to fill them to overflowing to get a whole ounce. Also, sometimes the lids don't seem to fit quite right or stay on well. But most of the time they do. I always wash them by hand, as other reviewers had said the lids warp in the dishwasher."
3,did i pay for an ice tray with lids?,Yes i did. Did i get a lot of use from this. NO I DID NOT.It works but i could have just used ice trays and i barely used this stuff in the end
2,looks familiar,"it's an ice cube tray...with a lid. if you are looking for two ice cube trays with lids this product is for you. otherwise if you already own an ice cube tray and some plastic wrap, you probably don't need this."
3,Just OK,"I bought these when baby was little and only used them for breastmilk. I found it very hard to get the cubes out of the tray and they weren't 1oz as I thought they were going to be, so I'd have to stuff twice as many into a bottle to get the number of ounces I wanted. I ended up getting the flexible silicone ones by the time I was making baby food and I think they work much better.They are BPA free though, so that's good."
2,lids aren't snug and frostbite overnight,"I wanted to love these trays. I have been nothing but disappointed. I could have saved money and bought other storage containers. The lids do not fit very snug. I make food, leave it overnight, and by morning there is frost on the cubes. Grr. I immediately transfer to ziploc bags for storage. I will continue to use them because I am not willing to spend any more."
2,Just an expensive ice cube tray,"These are really just an expensive ice cube tray. I should have just bought a few more of the ones I have from Ikea- they have covers that fit, they're flexible and they're cheaper. The covers on these don't fit and they are not flexible. I have a heck of a time getting stuff out of them. I guess I fell into that silly new parent thing- must buy all kinds of baby stuff."
2,At my wits end with these!,"Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I cannot, for the LIFE of me, get the food out easily from these trays. I have tried banana, avocado, sweet potato and breast milk. These trays are not flexible in the slightest, so twisting does not work. I have tried running hot water over the bottom to loosen the cubes, banging them on the counter (not such a practical idea when baby is napping), prying them out with a knife - all to no avail. I can eventually get them out through brute force, but it is VERY difficult.Maybe they will get easier to twist after enough use. My husband is going to try tonight as well, and maybe his manly man strength can make it happen.Lid fits great for us."
2,makes small cubes,"my biggest complaint with these trays is that they make tiny cubes, not 1oz cubes as they claim. it's turned into a game in our house -- how many cubes will it take to make 5oz? 8? 9? it's inconsistent and hard to measure how much my baby is eating. i'll probably buy different trays soon and get rid of these."
3,Silicone is safer and last longer and works better.,After trying sever different options I found one that really works and this is not it. Silicone is much safer and last longer and easier to use. A better solution is Wilton Bite-Size Brownie Squares 24-Cavity Silicone Mold Pan. If you search for Silicone molds there are more options. Having a bit of space makes them freeze faster and much easier to remove from the pan. These are just ice cube trays with covers. Not worth the extra money.
2,"good concept, has fatal flaw","When I first saw this product, I was excited about it. It looked durable and I loved the silicon lid. However, the use of this product in freezing my homemade baby food purees is not great. The trays are very rigid; there is no way to twist the product (like one would an ice tray) to remove the cubes. YOu have to let them thaw a little to get them out, and for many different foods (like prunes!) this is disastrous. In fact, I still have a tray of prunes from when I first tried the trays! I've tried banging them on the counters and the only thing I have found to get the food out is to run water along the back of the trays, and leave them sitting upside-down for about 5 minutes. Most of the cubes will fall out, and you can usually bang or pry the last few.The lid works well and fits snugly. I really wanted this product to be great, but it isn't."
5,Great buy,"I really like this product. We decided to make our own baby food for our twin girls. These trays make it so easy and quick. I really like being able to take out one ounce serves so we know how much our girls are getting. Best things: Store great, quick and easy. The cube can be tricky to get out sometimes, so I just run some water on the back of the try before I take off the lid to pop them out and they come out very easily..."
3,Works pretty well but NOT 1-ounce compartments,"I have been using these trays to store breastmilk for about a week now, and I like the convenience and simplicity of these over the plastic freezer bags. However, the cube compartments do NOT hold one ounce. It is more like 3/4 of an ounce in each one. Perhaps you can fit 12 ounces in the tray if you come close to overflowing it, but otherwise the product's advertising is misleading. It does not really hold 12 ounces. My only other complaint is that the trays are very stiff, therefore it's a bit difficult to twist the tray to loosen the cubes. The cubes do not pop out--you have to use a thin knife or something to tease them out after loosening them with a challenging twist of the tray."
5,LOVE!,"Guess what I use this for besides baby food???? BOOB-cicles!!!!!I freeze milk and put it in the mesh teether made for fruit! Perfect for teething babies and much better then sugary fruit all the time! The lid is a super tight seal! Kind of a thick try, but if my husband is not home to pop the cubes out, I just run the bottom under warm water for a second to loosen them out!"
3,Not what it said,"I love using this to make baby food and I use it weekly but it said each tray has 12,1 oz sections. That is untrue! Each section is only 1/2 oz. that make a big difference when making my sons food. It takes me longer to make 24 oz in the freezer because I have to wait for the first batch to freeze then refill. I still like it but just thought other buyers should know."
4,The only issue is the lids,"Grwat trays, perfect portions, safe plastic, durable. They are much sturdier plastic than regular ice cube trays, that being said they are not as easy to twist to loosen the contents...I have to let them either sit out for a few minutes or run warm water over the outside so I can twist them to get my food cubes out. The lids are ok, I have had difficulty getting them to seal on, you cannot expect a great seal with these lids, not an issue for me because I empty the contents the next day into ziplocks."
1,Not well made.,"Great idea, poor quality. Does not create tight seal so defeats the purpose. Warps in dishwasher, even on top rack. Freezer burn on baby food.....bad."
3,"Well made, shape isn't ideal","These baby food trays are well made and wash well in the dishwasher (no heat dry, top rack only). They even come with instructions to help refit the lid if it becomes warped in the dishwasher. But the style of the tray just isn't as user friendly as others that make the cubes with curved bottoms. Getting the frozen food out of the tray requires turning it over and twisting like a normal ice cube tray, which means you have to have a large ziploc around the tray to catch it all. Not a problem, but certainly not as easy as sliding one out of the tray by pushing on one side like one can with the ""half moon"" shaped food slots. Love the construction, but wish they'd change the shape."
3,Good product but would probably buy larger containers.,"I made all of my twins' baby food for the months they were eating pureed foods. For twins, I had 4 trays that I filled, froze, and then emptied into plastic bags for storage. Remember, if you're freezing, you don't have to worry about the type of plastic effecting the food; that's only if you're heating in plastic. If I had it to do over again, I would have bought bigger containers and froze enough in each container to last about 2-3 days in the frig. If you want these containers anyway, they are nice. I put them in the dishwasher on the top rack."
5,Wonderful item,"I did a lot of research before selecting these trays, and I couldn't be more pleased. I use them for freezing homemade baby food purees and breast milk (for thinning baby food and making cereal). Once the food or milk is frozen, I pop the cubes out and store them in freezer bags. The trays are simple to use and easy to clean."
3,"Very healthy, but...","I like this cookbook and have used it a lot ever since my dad had his heart attack. Healthwise, I can't complain at all about the recipes. However, I've found some of them to be a bit bland, and the serving sizes seem small. I usually end up following the recipe exactly once, figuring out what it needs to be better, and cooking it again that way."
4,Great Cookbook for Heath Healthy Eating,"For those of us that need to eat healthier, this cookbook will take much of the work out of it. The recipes are delicious, and the guidelines make it earier to live healthy and eat good at the same time. Highly recommend this book."
5,Just what the Doctor ordered.,"When I purchased this item I had no idea it would be in the great shape it was in. It was even spiral bound as to read receipes from as you made the dish. And the book itself? JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED. I cannot take cholesterol medications for some reason, but I have already made over 20 of the great dishes in this book, and even my HUSBAND is eating them. Wonderful, useful, helpful book, and a great seller and price to boot. Who could ask for anything more?"
3,slbcincy,"Good read, but not what I expected and in a little worse shape than described. Lots of good recipes for those looking for low fat, low cholesterol foods. Received in timely manner. Overall satisfied with this transaction."
2,No pictures!,The only picture in this cookbook is on the cover. This was very disappointing to me. I like to get a visual on what I'm eating before I cook it. I love looking at the pictures of recipes and in this cookbook you'll find none. Other than the lack of visuals I can't complain.
4,yummy recipes,the book was used but still in very good condition. we tried some of the recipes out on my teenage sons and they didnt realize that the food was healthy. still a lot of the good food that people think are bad but made in a healthy way. not bland or tasteless recipes.
3,The shoes are all wrong!,"Don't get me wrong--I'm a huge fan of Tierney's paper dolls and own more sets of them than I can count. I very eagerly waited for the Irish Dancer set to be published, as I was Irish dancing myself at the time, but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Tierney's dolls are usually so carefully researched, but in these, he seems to have no understanding of what Irish dancing shoes look like. The hard shoes look like none I have ever seen before--they appear to be a slip-on type with no toe tap, laces, or ankle strap at all. The ghillies look more realistic, but there's not a poodle sock in sight.The dresses, however, are quite lovely, drawing from both traditional school & competition-style dresses as well as ""Riverdance"" and other similar shows."
3,Beautiful but not what I expected,I expected the dolls to be perforated so my daughter and friends could be self-sufficient. We have yet to touch the book as it will require me helping her cut them out.
3,if we had only known,"was it worth the purchase it is entirely up you. if you wish to purchase this dvd to complete your series, then feel free to purchase. was it worth the family to move to a bigger house yes. it was worth watching how the eight kids was going to make the transition from the house that they were living in to the much bigger house. it was also fun to see how the kids would take care of two dogs."
4,A great retro game collection,"This is one of the best retro game collections out there. I remember playing Pooyan, Time Pilot, and Gyruss on my Commodore 64 years ago. They're still a blast to play. Kudos to Konami for adding Dual Shock support of the games. This adds to their intensity. It would have been nice if Konami included more background information on the games (designer interviews, etc.) but, all in all, they did a great job. The translations are arcade perfect. You'll be coming back to play time and time again. Recommended."
2,Works Ok,"I have used this product to burn home movies onto DVD for some time now. That part works fine. But just recently I have decided I wanted to put my pictures on a DVD with music. I got it to work once with about 75 pictures. But when I started trying to add several slideshows it comes up with ""dvderrr"". Honestly tech support was not much help.All they do is direct you to their website for solutions. Which I have tried and still no resolution to my problem. Don't recommend. Anyone know of a better product out there you can use to burn your home movies and put a slideshow with music on DVD?"
1,Absolute waste of money- will not create a viable DVD,"Absolute waste of time and money. #1: install disk has a setup file that causes install not to work on some machines. Have to figure out on your own, through vague knowledge base, then download proper setup file and copy everything to HD to install. Already that's a lot of time wasted. #2: unable to consistenly capture from Sony D8 camcorder- MyDVD drops it intermittently, other capture apps capture fine. #3: after going through hoops to get video captured and ready to burn, after one or two failed attempts at burning (stability issue), final disk is not usable because audio and video are out of sync. #4: tech support is a joke. Nearly useless knowledgebase, unresponsive tech support staff. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE LOTS OF MONEY AND TIME."
2,Bad At The Basics,I received the deluxe version with my Dell Media Edition compter. While this program has many bells and whistles actually editing video is awkward and frustrating. Fine tuning is difficult. I'm trying to edit home videos plus edit commercials out of movies recorded from TV. While this process should be easy this program makes it much more time intensive than it should be. The program is also fairly unstable. It seems to regularly lock-up while working on files much larger than 1 or 2 gigs. And that's on a new computer with plenty of memory.
2,Buggy product and awful tech support,"I have the 6.1 version for about a year and it has been one bug after another. The ""nudge"" buttons did not work properly. Tech support eventually sent me an ""improved"" version which did clear up this problem. When I edit a DVD which was produced using My DVD, all the titles are lost. The Sonic Player which comes as part of the package still does not work. My requests for help go unanswered. It is too bad because in many ways this is a nice package with a lot of neat features. I bought it naively to upgrade the basic version that my pc came with. In retrospect, if I had done my research Iwould have probably ended up wit a Pinnacle product."
2,BEWARE Zip Technical Support BEWARE,"The product is ok, when it works alright. Definitely buggy! I would give it more stars if there was technical support, but the support is a joke. The ""online"" support is basically email that goes unanswered. Remember, buyer beware."
1,"Got It Free, Still Overpriced",This came w/ my new DVD burner and does an absolutely horrible job of backing up files. Unless you check the burned DVD manually you don't know what's missing - in my case about 1/2 the files! This could be a nightmare if you actually needed your backup.
1,Good concept but has many bugs.....,Got this program with my new Dell computer. I spent hours putting together a great DVD with photo slides and videos. When I went to burn it to DVD it kept coming up with errors. I looked up the error on the website and it said that some sound or video files may be in a different format than what are supported by the program... so I created a new slide show with no music as a test - same errors appeared. The only way I got a DVD to burn was when I went directly from my camcorder to the DVD burner using this program. Lots of time wasted here. Very disappointed.
1,Very bad!!!,"I bought this program to burn DVDs of t.v. shows I recorded w/ TiVo. It's been a complete disaster. Lots of software programs are buggy, etc., but not only is this program slow, almost impossible to use to edit videos with any precision, and apparently won't work with Windows XP for TiVo recordings, but to top it all off the tech support people are absolutely useless. They've wasted hours of my time on hold, and then they best they can offer is an email with a link to their web page (which of course I'd checked before calling). From what I've read online, lots of people are having this problem, esp. for use w/TiVo recordings. If you have TiVo, DO NOT buy this program (even though it's the one that TiVo recommends). It's been a complete waste of my money"
3,It's okay,"I received the wrong color and where the reds logo is, it's very stiff. I bought it for my husband to use after his work-outs."
1,Absolutely terrible,"This is one of the worst games I've ever played. The gameplay is repetitive at an obnoxious level within minutes of beginning the painfully dull narrative of a story. I wasn't disappointed only because this isn't like the other Soul Calibur games, though it did have something to do with it; I was disappointed because this game is simply bad. There's really nothing more to say."
1,DON'T buy it.,"Do not buy Soul Calibur Legends, ok? Trust me, buy Soul Calibur IV or III instead. If you like this kind of game, buy Dynasty Warrior. It's a much better version. Soul Calibur Legends is overall a horrible game. DON'T buy this game if you know what's good for you."
4,"very happy,will do again","Was very happy with game. Took a little time to get here,other than that,It's all good!"
2,Uh...,I can't say that I hate the game itself. I think I probably hate the platform. This game forces you to use the nunchuck to play. I'm not a fan of that and don't play this game. I'd tried this game on another platform and enjoyed it well enough to try it on my game system. Did not know I had to use the nunchuck. Will likely trade it in or sell it due to the need to use the nunchuck.
1,DONT BUT THIS GAME,Its nothing like any other Soulcalibur game theres no real versus mode and the game Is quite boring.. its only an RPG game not a fighting game like Mortal Kombat or the original Soul Calibur games....
3,Not Quite As Remembered,"I loved this game as a teenager and this is my reasoning for ordering this game. However, the format is not as I remember it to be. Maybe I will order the first one. What happened to the combat rings?"
2,How to corrupt a decent fighting game...,"This is not a figthing game. It is a sword bashing soul calibur wannabe... The story line is weak. The graphics for a system like Wii is acceptible. The camera throughout the game is one of the worst that I have ever experienced. Gameplay is ok, but you get tired after doing the same things all the way. Please read the reviews and do not buy this. Namco Bandai should have worked harder if it wants to create a good game out of a legendary fighting game..."
4,Fast-paced sci-fi thriller,"It's nice to see some sci-fi in the world of romance novels! Stargazer is an up-tempo journey into a beautiful new world, lush with scenery and dynamic characters. I was glad to find some characters to love and some characters that I loved to hate! Cliffhangers at the end hook readers for the next in the series."
5,Wonderful!!,This is a great story for a wide age range--purchased for my Granddaughter's 3rd birthday--the illustrations are so much fun
1,"Awful, terrible, unreadable","I bought this book mainly because of my interest in opera. Had I read the acknowledgments before purchasing the book I would have right away known that it would not be to my taste. It is full of cliches, it is terribly written and the plot twists are predictable from the beginning. If you care about well written literature stay away from this book."
3,"Good Mystery, but...","I thought this book was a great mystery book, but there was sooo much drama. Honestly, at a couple points in this story I literally threw the book down because I couldn't handle the stupidity that an otherwise ""smart"" character would show. It had good intrigue, but was overly drawn out."
5,DeJohn weaves an excellent tale,"DeJohn sets the standards high with stellar first novel. She pulls you into the time and environment with incredible detail and description of the characters, surroundings, and emotions. Based on the life and travels of her grandmother, she pours compassion into her work that begins to pour off the page, you really feel that the characters existed at one point in time. This is a novel for everyone with elements that everyone will enjoy: love, hate, action, world travel, up's and down's, and anything else one can ask for in a book."
2,"Be advised, be very advised...","This is a small flyer-style leaflet of the stage play put on in Pennsylvania in 2000. This is not a novel, but it is novel (ha ha ha...oh nevermind)"
3,Apple Fantasy Body Mist,"The product came as specified; in a timely manner. The pricing was ok. As for the product, I totally forgot how it use to give me a strange headache immediately after misting it all over. Hmm, I love the smell of Apple but I think there's others out there way better"
5,Great Read,"This author is very gifted. I absolutely enjoyed reading Continnum, it really speaks to the soul. He's not bad to look at either! I highly suggest the book to any poetry lover."
5,Nice Poetry. Great Eye Candy.,This was an fascinating read. The only thing that would make it better is if there were a few more photos of the author. : )
1,Rip off!,This is rip off. It was recorded off the tv when there was a Carol Burnett marathon on. I recently ordered the real episodes and they are wonderful. Don't fall for this like I did! I wanted to give zero stars.
3,"decent, but nothing fantastic","This would be fine for those who want to keep a book on them while waiting in line or in the waiting room of a doctor's office. I wasn't that impressed with this anthology, although I'm sure it contains some nice pieces of literature. However, I wouldn't call any of them ""masterpieces."""
3,Fun.,"Here is a book which I read over the course of a couple of years exclusively in the bathroom of our family's cabin at Lake of the Woods, Oregon.The gimmick is that these are ""short masterpieces"" but the reality is that they are basically very short stories by writers you may have heard of for their better, longer short stories. In other words not many masterpieces but a lot of short two to five page stories. Fun!"
1,Save Your Money,I read all of the short stories thinking they had to get better. Guess what? They don't. The publisher should be sued for false advertising...Masterpieces???? A complete waste of paper.
3,"Does what it says, with some 'feedback'..","I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Kicker Remote (KICKER REMOTE FOR ZX SERIES AMPLIFIERS). Overall, it works as described! Muted on low and as if it wasnt there on full open. But in between is where the problem is. Even with no incoming signal (radio off) if I have this switch set up anywhere between the - and + there is noticable feedback coming through the subs. At half way its enough to shake the entire car, but when I turn it up farther or lesser, it goes down! I have the power and RCA cables running opposite sides of the car so I know its not from there... At this point I'm just considering getting the Remote."
1,Lame,"It's pretty much just a switch, you either have it on ore off, there is a very very very small place on the dial that will fade but it's so small it's basically not there. It's either on or off no fading in or out no volume up or down waste of time and money"
4,"Great, but missing an extra item.","Well I got this thinking that it would come with everything I would need to install into my car. I went out and pulled my head unit out and I was looking at this dumbfounded, the four rca on the PAC LC1 are all females, and the plugs that it needs to be plugged into are also females. So I took a good 10 minutes looking over the package box thinking I was doing something wrong, and then ended up looking for some RCAs in my house that were all males.Other than that mishap, I think this item works great!, it was exactly what I needed, the ability to have good bass when there is no one in the back seats, and crank it down when there is, and all in the comfort of your seat. Get it!"
5,Really Helpful!,I am in an accelerated RN program and I had never before written a care plan. I found the required Carpenito book too difficult to follow and my clinical instructor recommended this one. It was great. All you have to do is look up the condition you are ineterested in and it will give you all revelant care plans. I highly receommend it to all new nursing students.
2,Very basic,The entries contained in this text were very simplistic. Most of the interventions should have been common sense.
2,disappointed,Received the book and it was moist and all the pages showed signs of mold.. wish I would have known this..
3,Not bad for the price,A little outdated. A big book to take a long to clincals however would work well to use at home for care plans
5,Nursing Care Plans,This books helps me complete my required Care Plans due after each clinical. Thank goodness for this book!Great Value and the book exceeded my expectations.
5,Humbled and Flattered,...to have stalkers. Glad to have touched your life in such a way. While you are at it please be sure to post the OTHER review afforded us by ANOTHER writer from that site as well.Thanks for giving TSE so much of your time.Best to you and yours.
2,"Haven tried, but Aiwa coming out with new recorder..","Havent tried this product, but i've seen a lot of cons sorta.. 1st off is the battery, if it dies i see its hard to find a new one, thats just an annoyance.. 2nd is that i hear this thing breaks pretty easily.. Another pain to return to store and all.. 3rd is that Aiwa is coming out with a new F80 player. Its in Japan and you can order it off the web.. Basically same hting but different look, and comes with the Mic. and all.. I think if you wanna pay the extra $$$ for live recordings and all get that.. But if you really wantone now, i say go for the Sony MZ-35.. looks like its the best deal out there.."
2,Short term satisfaction,"When I first purchased this mini disc player i was reallypleased with its sound quality. The only things that dissapointed mewere the lack of high volume, the remote and the fact that the headphones broke within the first day. I was still happy though, and was for a month. But one day i took the player out of my bag and pressed play. Instead of hearing high quality recordings i heard nothing and my mini disc player flashed me a caution message. The 'customer help' guys at aiwa told me to do things to the player that didn't help it at all and they finally gave me an address to ship it to. Luckly I didn't have to pay for anything except for shipping but it was still a major pain to not have the player for a good 2 months. Aiwa products have been known to break after short periods of time. Try Sony for a more reliable product END"
4,A good minidisc player,"Love the design, rechargable battery, headphones, backlit lcd, sound quality.Wish it had a belt clip, was lighter.Never use the carrying case (it's a bag with a drawstring), optical cable (my stereo's not good enough to have an optical out)Hate that it takes as long to record as tapes do, and that I can almost never record for the entire 74 minutes of a disc. I mean I can but when I play it back it starts to skip after about 50 minutes.I also had trouble with the door on mine (one day it stopped opening), and the discs no longer eject themselves when I open it, I have to stick my finger in and pull them out.It can skip too."
4,very good sound quality,"This recorder/player is very easy to operate by both player and remote, however the battery attachment is rather cumbersum when attached. It would great if it included an AM/FM radio."
4,"a good machine, but still without radio AM-Fm",I am waiting to see if one of the big corporations will come out with a MD with recoder and radio at the same time. I will buy that in ione second
1,Don't WASTE Your Money!!!!,"Ug! This game *was* one of the worst PS games I've ever played. I say ""was"" because I traded it in at Funcoland after playing it twice! I love racing games--be they arcade style or simulations such as Gran Turismo--so I bought this game the day after it was released just because it was a different 'type' of racing games. I can't begin to adequately describe how disappointed I was with the game. The tracks are tough to follow--and novice racers will spend an unbelievable amount of time just driving in circles trying to figure out where the course is (even the directional arrow doesn't help much). And even when you do find the course, the control is so bad you can't hardly stay on it, anyway. In sum, if you think you might be interested in this game---go ahead and rent it (though even that will be a total waste of money). However, I strongly recommend you NOT buy this game. It is a total disappointment!!!"
1,this game ...,atv off road fury is the gayest game ive ever played. i mean come on the freakin ataris have better graphics. when i bought this game 5 minutes after i played it i broke it. dont waste your money
5,A must read for anyone interested in nationalism,"Mallon's theory of ""peasant nationalism"" is thought provoking for anyone interested in the construction of nationalism. Her work is a great example of how comparative historical research in Latin America can yield new insights for historians in other fields. Not only is her work instructive for those interested in popular conceptions of what it means to be in a nation, but her narrative is well written and engaging"
1,oh my god,This game shouldn't have been made it shows no sign of greatness on the speedometer says 214mph it feels like 35 mph. Going to school is more fun than this game.It shows no sign of speed and when you hit the wall back in those days there was fire when you hit the wall in this game you bounce off and nothing happens. Only fun factor is it's too easy you can win every time.other than that this game is just awful.
1,Awful order fulfillment,"Actually this is not a review of the product itself but of Amazon's handling of the order. I placed the order on April 6 and Amazon arbitrarily substituted a different, inferior model of which they shipped a USED unit. Incidentally, I also ordered a power washer and again Amazon shipped a USED unit in a delapidated package.True, Customer Service approved the return of both units but shlepping two 35 lb packages to the UPS store is not my idea of online shopping.Amazon has lost a good customer."
5,Handel with Gusto,"Already having owned a reading of this opus by the English Concert (Pinnock, 1980s), and having previewed Manze's reading with the AAM, this one was more my style.Antonini and his ensemble have breathed some new style and penache into this collection of string concerti grossi. This is a more severe, more dramatic reading. It's typical IGA, ""dynamic"" playing, clear contrasts, and a very Italian style. Supposedly Antonini suggests in the liner notes that they after identifying Handel's Italian style in these works, they thought they'd better previous efforts with their own Italian style.Whatever you call the result, it's easy to listen to, engaging, and fresh all in one."
3,In the school setting,"I bought Stop Snitchin' to help teachers and school resource officers. This video helped us see what we are up against when we try a help school children learn that telling a teacher a student is planning on hurting someone is not a form of snitchin. The video really helps adults see what junk some in hip - hop culture are teaching our kids. In one part of the video, 60 minutes interviews several kids. They clearly explain what they are learning from the ""stop snitchin"" message."
3,Ripped Off,"I purchased this product, expecting to install on ALL of my Macs. After upgrading my G3 laptop to Mac OS X Version 10.4.8, most of the iLife applications disappeared and couldn't be reinstalled using the Apple iLife '06 Family Pack DVD. And, short of buying USED versions of iLife '05 or '04 seperately (Apple doesn't sell them), I couldn't find any other way of installing iLife applications that would run on my G3. Shouldn't I be given the option of using my up-to-date Apple iLife '06 Family Pack to download elements of older versions of iLife from Apple's website that would run on my G3? Why should I have to purchase older used versions at additional expense when I've already upgraded to the latest version?"
3,Dated,I did enjoy parts of it especially descriptions of Rome in the 1960's but otherwise it was dated. The character of Mrs. Stone was unrealistic.
5,Love is Enough!,A delightful collection of her most beloved poems. A book that inspires as well as enlightens.
3,shoping focused,"Decent book. But, I had purchased the eye witness guides in the past and thought this was the same, but was wrong. The eye witness ones are much better for what to do. This is more on shopping and food."
3,Good travel planning read,"This is a good book to read before visiting Paris. The whole book is made up of short reviews accompanied by a single photo of restaurants, cafes, shopping stores, and bars and clubs. If you're looking for hip places to go then look it over before your trip and make travel notes. The book is NOT a travel guide in any traditional sense, and you wouldn't find it worthwhile to lug it around Paris with you."
1,THE AUTHOR AS SCHOLAR,"Page 67:"". . .another of history's jokes, the Book of Concord (1580)"" (without further elaboration).Do you think Mr. Collinson actually read it?"
2,Definitely not an introduction,"The major problem I have with this text is that it's definitely not what the cover reviews call it, and it is certainly not for those without a strong background in early modern history. As an Oxford educated late modern historian, I picked up this book thinking it would help me organize my thoughts for a lecture, and instead found that I was no better off for having read it. I had been using Diarmaid MacCulloch's much larger tome, and I ought to have stuck with it!Collinson's work is full of untranslated Latin and French, and it assumes a solid base of knowledge of the Reformation. While there are pockets of good information, I think the book is better suited to those who have done more extensive research on the period and are already well informed on the subject. Don't pick this book up if you're looking for a good overview, you're better off reading sections of a larger work."
2,NOT FOR THE UNINITIATE,"Patrick Collinson is hailed on the book jacket as ""Regius Professor of Modern History, Emeritus, Cambridge. A renowned scholar of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. . . ."" I found this very small book, like any history, to have interesting nuggets, but was disappointed in that it assumed a familiarity with Reformation history I lack --and in fact purchased the book to acquire. The chapter on Calvin and Calvinism, for example counts only 16 small pages. These raced over the subject in a high-speed rattling-off of names, dates, and places, without engaging me in the historical story. One jacket blurb (London Times) recommended this book to readers like myself because of its brevity. I disagree. Find a larger book."
2,too little on too much,"Like a couple of the others who've reviewed this book I believe this book to be a poor choice to get a handle on Reformation history. I think a more ""timeline"" type approach would have been better. Instead, this work bounces around and throws bits and pieces at you. Makes it difficult to ""get your brain around"" so to speak. Being an intentionally short work he could have taken a few major paths and fleshed out their effect on Europe rather than trying to hit the highlights of so much. A very difficult read for those without a decent amount of knowledge on the Reformation to begin with."
4,"Easy to read, always!","Ever since I had cataract surgery, seeing things close up was a problem. For example: I could never really read what the time was on my wristwatch! So I found this Timex on-line and decided to try it out!I did have to change the watch band to a expansion model because the original was too tight on my wrist, so I went to Wal-mart and got one easily. Now, this watch works for me!Watch keeps perfect time, & is easily read even at night! Problem solved!"
3,mixed feelings,"I have had three Timex easy readers. While these watches have a great look that is very classic, they are not very durable. Each of my three watches has stopped working in less than a year. I am sure they can be easily fixed, but since these things are so cheap I don't bother taking it to a watch repair man who will charge me more than the cost of the watch to fix it, I just buy a new one."
5,You can't lose with a Timex,"Classic style and Timex experience made me choose it. I like big watches with large numbers, so often buy men's watches although I'm a woman! The light up in the dark feature was a welcome and pleasant surprise. Would recommend to fellow Timex fans."
5,An important contribution to Lincoln assassination study,"Since the day Lincoln was assassinated, many theories have emerged about who was the mastermind behind the plot. Among the accused have been members of the Confederate government, including Jefferson Davis, the Catholic Church and members of Lincoln's own Cabinet.Hanchett examines these conspiracy theories and the people who put forward the theories in an attempt to find out if a higher authority, civil or religious, ordered John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators to kill Lincoln and members of his Cabinet. By examining each theory individually as well as the motives behind those who suggested the theories, Hanchett does an excellent job of refuting some of the more unlikely theories."
2,a very confusing novel,"This book showed each side to any conspiracy that could have been involved in the Lincoln assassination. I became confused after reading a chapter and then all of that historian thinking was rejected by some other guy. If you are into that kinda thing, sure go ahead and read the book, but I just got confused. I can't determine what really happened and what was people's thoughts."
2,Transparent conspiracies,"Of course one cannot expect academics to think so far outside the box that a thesis uniting the two concepts they juxtapose, conspiracy and transparency, would have any merit, but that's not saying much. In my book ""The Transparent Conspiracy"" I suggest precisely this, in reference to 9/11. I would be glad to be proved wrong, to have my theory destroyed not only as unprovable (which it probably is, given the current historical situation), but as illogical, crazy, etc. Until that happens, I have to consider it logical, sane, and the best theory of reality around, since it explains more of the ""facts"" (read ""mysteries, lies and contradictions"") than any other."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A treat to have this combination. Mike Mignola in a rare foray into the superhero world, and Jim Starlin's flare for space hero adventures. The Justice League must join forces with the New Gods to have enough firepower to stop a really serious threat from Darkseid.They screw up, bigtime."
1,FM RADIO! NO WAY,"DONT BUY THIS ITEM....it claims to have an FM radio, but actually doesnt work at all."
5,#1 in balance ball workouts,"In my opinion, this one along with the 10 minute Solutions DVD is a great full week of workouts that give you so many variations so as not to become bored with it all. This trainer is easy to listen to and follow along with. It's fun and really targets troubled spots. You can choose the shorter version workout if your in a hurry or the extended version. Both are superb in the variety of intensity that you can choose for each of her exercises."
4,Workout,This seems to be a good workout for me. However I am not sure if this would be for beginners. I was kinda of expecting shorter interval workouts.
4,Great workout,"I am totally enjoying this DVD. I'm not much into the gym scene, but found during the rainy season I needed something to keep me motivated. This DVD is fun and you get a fantastic workout. I will admit, it's taken me several viewings to be able to keep up with the fast version of each move. You will definitely feel a burn and can alter the moves to fit your endurance level.I'd recommend this for anyone. Looking forward to purchasing more of her stuff."
1,it couldn't start,The instruction is confusing. The machine does not start after I followed all the instructions. Bad experience. Wasted my time. Shame on the manufacturer!
2,Had some probs,"I'd like to be able to write a better review...but I bought this puppy this morning and ended up taking it back late this afternoon. I'm assuming there was some kind of factory defect with the choke. I could get it to start and it would run ""ok"" for about 60 seconds and then start to sound bad so I'd turn it off. But then it wouldn't start again. The choke kept moving to the wrong position. It would only start if I had my wife hold the choke in position. So...after 5 or 6 hours of messing with it and trying to figure out what was wrong with it, I took it back to the store. Again, not saying it's a bad machine...but I DID have a bad experience."
1,Absolutely THE WORST lawnmower on earth,"Stay away from this manufacturer. The one I bought had: the handle for the drive fail to engage, the engine starts only half the time and the left rear wheel just fell off. But my old trusty Toro is 3 times older and keeps running (I'm glad I kept it for a spare)."
4,Excellent book.,"This book featured a great deal of useful information. The book reads easily and is a fantastic starting point for any citizen with a concealed carry permit. I would have liked to have some specific shooting drills designed for CCW permit holders but, overall the book was very informative and I would highly recommend it. Readers of the author's regular magazine columns will recognize the style of writing and professionalism."
5,Wonderful coming of age story,"Very well written. Easy to read. Warm, believable characters. Great stories about three boys special, moving and very amusing summer. A touching story that would be wonderful for a reader of any age. Among the very best I have read in the last few years."
5,As Good as Advertised,"Well, Amazon and their vendors hit another home run. This is a REALLY GOOD, well built product. MADE IN THE GOOD OLD USA too, and THAT MEANS a lot to ME. I measured the way their information says, placed the order, and received it within a week or better with standard shipping. Hard to find USA products. They were a perfect fit for my 25 year old Majestic, zero clearance fireplace insert. Feel free, with confidence, to order this as a replacement for worn out fire curtains."
3,"close, but no cigar...","BUYER BEWARE... this looks like a quality package, but the sources used sound of an MP3 quality, especially the On Earth as it is in Heaven stuff. The included booklet, lyric sheet and photos inside are top notch, but the audio falls way short. Another note, this comp and its companion, vol. 1 both come to us by way of Russia. Apparently, the band is ""White Hot"" over there. But remastered versions are not. Is it a bootleg? You decide...fendemos"
5,works great!,"Fits very well, even with all my hair stuffed into it. Doesn't hurt my head, keeps the hair out of my face and the water out of my ears, and you can't beat the price! I can't imagine swimming without it now. Would definitely recommend."
4,Great product,"Great product. It's a very reliable brand, and I've always used it. Keeps it tight along with the goggles and perfect for all types of water. Sea, pool, lakes."
2,Didn't like it at all,Very big for my head ant the material doesn't like me at all seems like rubber from a car neumatic
2,HORIBLE CAP!!!,This swim cap melts and gets sticky in the sun so make sure you have goof off! NO JOKE!!! buy another cap these suck!!!! other than that they do hold out the water for about half of your hair.
2,Itchy for some reason,"I'm not sure if I have an allergy or something, but as soon as I tried this cap on my face become extremely itchy and irritated - I had to wash it several times and put some creme on and it still hurt for about an hour. Needless to say I couldn't wear it to the pool."
2,Already broken,"I've just bought it for two months, and last time when I try to put it on, it's too tight and finally it broke..."
5,Very good fit and feel,The hat fits very nicely even though I have a large pony tail. No problem what so ever. Highly recommend.
2,"Very tight, hard to put on, comes off while swimming","This cap is difficult to put on, and both times I have used it, it comes off while swimming. Also, It seems to rub and pull on my hair."
2,Too tight and ugly shape,"I thought this cap is more flexible, but it is really tight. Then the shape is like a mushroom where I believe it's design for women with more hair to tug in. However, I do not see it work well because it is very tight and it pulls the hair in a way that I feel if I have long hair, it will really start hurting. I do not see myself buying another of this cap in the future."
3,Speedo latex swim cap,"Too tight. Looks good but doesn't fit well or confortable. it is a product to use once, not for competitions or proffesionals"
5,Swimmer's best friend,"These are really not that difficult to put on, and if it is too tight you can fix it.Tip: Get the swim cap wet and open it up. Put two fists inside of the swim cap and stretch out the cap a little. Don't do it too much, but just a few times.Long haired girls: Pull your hair into a small tight bun. Take the swim cap and pull over the bun first then bring forward to the front of your head.I was on the swim team and I am a lap swimmer, I have never had a problem with these. My hair always stays dry and as long as you know how to put a swim cap on you will be just fine."
1,Worst cap I have tried,I will never buy a Latex cap again - extremely difficulty to put on because the cap rubs my hair off!
4,Water-tight,I like the fit of this swim cap as it is not overly tight on my big head and thick hair.
3,"Like the ribbed part, but getting ""stretch marks""?","I have very long hair, so putting this cap on was complicated. I found it easiest to soak my hair, wind it loosely around (but close to) my head, start from the front and pull it back. I then had to adjust the front a bit, and I always looked ridiculous, but I think the ribbing did help some. It was fine, I used powder, as suggested--but recently I noticed that there are some lines forming on the creases as though from stretching. It looks like it will rip eventually :/ This is highly disconcerting. I'm not really sure what to do. Luckily, I don't need it for the moment, but it makes me wonder about the quality. Did I get a dud?"
2,Girls with hair beware!,"This cap is impossible to put on! They could do a hidden camera show based on people trying to get this thing on and it would be hysterical. I have tried everything. I have long hair, but it is by no means insanely thick and everytime I loose a little more hair and dignity trying to get this over my head. Unless maybe you are bald (and even then you may find it hard to get on) I would suggest going for another type of cap/material."
5,Good and strong,Seems better made than the last Adidas I had which ripped open after a while. Does what it's made for. Good and strong. Nice color too.
2,It's tight,"I know swim caps are supposed to be tight, I know I have a big head, but this is totally another case. I'm a guy and my hair is shorter than most people, but after every 4-6 laps in the pool I need to take it off to allow blood circulation, or I'll end up having a mild headache on my way back.Also it gets sticky on the inside after contact with water, so take care when you dry it. I turn the inside out to prevent it from sticking together."
3,It is a so so speedo,"I bought this a year ago. It was okay for a while, but it never really prevente water from getting in, of course it is only a very small amount. Right now, the latex is getting sticky and I have to buy a new one."
5,miami heat,A great representation of miami's diversity. This album is hot. You go Kinship Konnection. I'm looking forward to hearing more from all of the artists.
3,Delisa loses a close decision,"I fear that this well written and richly detailed book has gotten lost in the shuffle of all of the Braddock biographies that have been published in the wake of the success of the film ""Cinderella Man"" Even though it's far from the best of the group, it deserves a better fate than that.Most of the Braddock volumes on the market have focused almost exclusively on the ring exploits of Braddock and his contemporaries, Delisa takes a slightly different approach in his narrative, incorporating more of Braddock's personal life into the story, and going into greater detail about events in his early childhood than other books have, to give the reader a more complete portrait of this American sports icon.In my humble opinion,Cinderella Man: James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing Historyby Jeremy Schaap is still the best book written on the subject, and I'll continue to recommend it, but Delisa's volume comes in a close second."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough Braddock","While the concept of Braddock's hardships and the level on which he competed are interesting, DeLisa puts too much emphasis on small details and characters. It was easy to get lost in his sauce of players, boxers, spectators, managers, this guy, and that guy. What about Braddock? What about his relationship with his kids, neighbors, family, in relation to boxing? Why not simply state the various build ups to different fights, as opposed to Primo Carnera's birthplace and the size of his underpants? This story does not get fully underway until more than half way through the book. It ends quickly without much information of Braddock's former years and how he lived after boxing. More about the concept of Cinderella and how other people were also fighting at the time--fighting to live. Wordy and simplistic, skip to the middle of the book. Don't waste time assuming the photos at the beginning of the chapters have much to do with the actual text and storyline."
5,excellent Aussie Film,"I loved this movie...the scenery, the musical score, but most of all the little boy. What a wonderful actor.Most of his acting was done with facial expressions. You knew immediately what he was feeling. I would highly recommend the film."
4,haunting custody story,"Careful he might hear you, is one of those old films I saw many times on VHS only because it has a beautiful score.17 years later the film stands up to the test of time and still gets me in a place where I am enthralled by the very young lead actors performance and Wendy Hughes performance as Vanessa.Its a dark tale about a little boy caught between the custody chains of two sisters and the fight they ensue to adopt him.Good stuff."
5,Careful he might hear you......enthralling,This was 1 of 2 movies I rented when it first came out. I decided to watch this movie last (it didn't sound that exciting)and started watching it around 1:00am (I fiqured I would finish it in the morning). I was literaaly riveted to the screen for the entire movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen.
1,waste of time,"i read the book several times and took notes. i then used the practice tests to study. i took the test and i believe that i passed. the problem is that i found myself making educated guesses on at least 50% of the questions. the book and practice tests were very similar to a normal text book and course test. that may seem like a good thing, however, the clep test was not organized in the same fashion. it asked for generalizations over a period of time. i also encountered several topics on the test which were not even mentioned in the book. as compared to the book i used for the principles of management test, i found this book to be a poor return on study time invested."
2,Nothing like the real thing!,"CLEP History of the United States I w/CD was NOT a realistic portrayal of what the test would be like. I got marks in the high 80s and 70s on the practice tests; lulling me into a false sense of security - I scored 48 on the actual exam = fail - cannot take the exam for 6 months AND the wording of the questions was so very much harder than the practice tests - I'm a very intelligent person and always use the books that I'm meant to when studying; this was a waste of money. KNOW quotes, KNOW causes and effects of events, KNOW authors of books and which periods they wrote in and about, KNOW key terminology, KNOW maps and how they change over time. Get 'Barons EZ101 Study Keys', 'America - A Narrative History vol.1 (brief version)' + 'HarperCollins College Outline - US History to 1877'!"
2,Didn't pass using this book...,"This was a good book as far as history. However I only remember a few of the questions on the test that this book covered. I studied this book for 7 weeks, had history book from the library, other sources. A waste of my money."
2,Huge disappointment,"I was totally disappointed in this book. I studied for a month and it did me little good. This book seems to be geared for a high school exam, not college level. Don't waste your money, I did, won't be referring this one to anybody."
1,"Pencil marks all over the book, folded and in extra used condition","I have bought many used books, and all were pretty clean and good to use. But this one got dark and real bad pencil marks all over, many pages were folded. I don't know!! how can use the tests given in this book, when all the answers are visible already??? I treid to erase but they are dark, marked and pretty visible. I wanted to take the CLEP test soon but I guess I will buy another book and then will take the exam. Good Luck."
5,The Printed Material You Need,"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I worried about the book's adequacy in preparing me for this CLEP exam. I supplemented my study of this book (including the use of the detailed explanation of the practice test questions) with some help from the HippoCampus free online AP US History presentations and was able to score a 74 out of 80 on the CLEP test very recently.I don't know what to say to those people who got a failing grade on this test. I only studied for a day and a half, and I hadn't taken any US History courses in eight years - and aced the test with 25 minutes to spare."
3,History of the United States I CLEP Study Guide,"I passed the exam but I did not do as well as I expected. However, I am going to defend this book and criticize the CLEP exam. This book is a great resource. It provides a comprehensive overview of the important events of American History (1500-1877) and I learned a great deal. I was pretty confident I would score well on the test after reading this book. Unfortunately, the CLEP exam that I was given focused on material which was not found in this particular book."
5,Concise and easy to understand.,"The reading includes all you need to know to pass, however, if you have some prior knowledge about history/government/sociology it would help. You can pass with just this book, but you really have to memorize a lot of information; there are many questions to answer in a short amount of time."
4,Book was enough..........,"Well I concur with another reviewer here, book was enough of a base for me to pass the CLEP test. However, many questions on the actual test referred to periods, antebellum, that were not listed in this book. It was extremely helpful to read the detailed answers in the back after missing a question or just for more in depth knowledge of the subject. Also their were a lot of questions on women's rights and activists that were just skimmed over in the book. If you just want to pass the test, this book would probably be enough as long as you study it well."
3,not too sharp,"I can't say a lot since I bought this for a different purpose than what it's meant for. BUT...since I use it to cut, I can say it doesn't hold an edge and that's it's main purpose: cutting. I bought it especially to make a parting tool for the lathe work I do. So, it still is used for cutting and it doesn't hold sharpness."
3,Purchasing a Paperback,I originally purchased this as a Kindle book and love the thoughts in the book however the kindle version does not include the scripture references. I'm returning my Kindle version and have ordered a paperback.
5,Le Comte Ory,"John Eliot Gardiner's award winning Philips recording of Rossini's sparkling French comedy, with outstanding performances from John Aler, Diana Montague and the amazing Sumi Jo as the cause of all the trouble!""Diana Montague's Isolier is a bright sparkling jewel of a performance ... Sumi Jo's Comtesse is a joy, too, fetching, dramatic and vocally expert ... In Act 1 Sumi Jo is all aerial brilliance ... in the Act 2 denouement, Jo brings a steely glint to her tone that leaves Ory, his fortunes sinking as fast as the vocal tessitura, in no doubt about who is the victor and who the vanquished ... John Aler ... is an accomplished Ory ... what Gardiner and his team invariably achieve is a strong sense of dramatic actuality ... this new set will give considerable pleasure to anyone who has yet to discover the inexhaustible delights afforded by this delectable score.""- THE GRAMOPHONE October 1989"
4,Not a top note to be heard,"This is beautiful music. Sumi Jo shines. Everyone else is adequate. No one sings a top note. No one. No one even goes near it, it's like a conspiracy to end every number on the lowest note the singer(s) can reach. Bleah! Nonetheless I love it. There's more to an aria than the last note in it. This opera proves that in no uncertain terms. But it's beautiful coloratura music anyway. As a rule I don't like Rossini, but this I like. It's beautiful coloratura music without a head."
2,"Dave Mirra, Joke???","If it is anything like the demo it will be horrible. In the demo you can do triple back flips and land. You can land pretty much anything which makes it unrealistic. Sometimes you even fall though the screen because of the many errors in game play. Although, it is very addicting and i guess you should buy it for something to do until thps2 comes out. Thank you"
5,I'm hopelessly addicted,"I played Hawk like mad, but since I got this game on Thurday, I haven't been able to put the controller down except to sleep and eat. It's that good. IMHO, even better than Hawk--and that's saying a lot. Mirra BMX has this Modifier trick system that lets you combine tricks on the fly. So for example, you can turn a Superman into a Superman Seatgrab or Superman One-Hander. There's 10 pro riders in the game, including Mirra, who's the reigning champ of BMX today. The sound track was awesome too--Sublime, Rancid, Social Distortion, Cypress Hill--the list goes on. Last but not least, the graphics rocked. The animations were silky smooth, and I still haven't seen nearly all of the 1,300 tricks you can do. I'm still playing the ProQuest mode, which lets you compete as a rider and earn real life sponsors like No Fear and Adidas and Fox, and then upgrade your bikes (all real bikes in the game, btw). I could go on and on here, but I gotta get back to playing!"
5,Wow,"Tony Hawks Pro Skater was definitly a landmark game for skateboarding, well, here is your landmark game for BMX and freestyle biking. I was pretty skeptic of BMX games at first because my friend has one for the computer and it was the worst game I had ever seen. But when I first popped this into the Playstation, I immediatley new that this was way better. The music is awesome, and in my opinion better than Tony Hawks Pro Skater. The crashes are realistic and when you watch your re-play, its so realistic that it looks like your watching a competition on TV. The controls are very simple. If you liked Tony Hawks Pro Skater, or if you bike or skate in real life you will love this game. Definitly a must-get."
3,So so,"I wanted to get my husband something differant than his race car games, so I bought this one. He says that the moves are hard to figure out but it is an ok game. He def preferes his race car games."
2,I do not like this game...PERIOD!,"The games choppy graphics are just the begining, i hate the game play, and it is not fun at all. Its hard to control,and the specials are hard to learn."
4,just bought dave mirra fs bmx,"This game is really good except it is too easy... You can pull a backflip off a 1 foot rail... Also it is too short...I beat it with Ryan Nyquist within 3 or 4 days, not even playing it a lot...get Matt Hoffman if you had to choose between the two."
3,IPOD Sleeve Review,"This product was what I was looking for, although we were a bit unsatisfied with the final product once we got it. The silicone is nice but it is almost a little too flimsy to use the arm band and exercise with it. I'd be scared that it would rip and my IPOD would be damaged"
3,Decent,"I thought this was pretty good for Boswell. To be honest, she's not a favorite of mine, but this book is worth a read. Not a run to the store and grab it, but a if I see it at the library, i'll pick it up.........."
2,Small book,"Although, it is a nice hardcover book it is very small in size and content. Only the size of maybe a childrens book."
1,Worst Transfer I've Seen... Ever,"One of the greatest joys of DVD for me is not watching your latest block-buster, but seeing older films restored to their former glory. Two of the best are ""Now Voyager"" and ""The Time Machine"", but this film ""Destination Moon"" has to be the worst transfer I have ever seen and basically renders the film unwatchable. I didn't even get past the first ten minutes before it was back in it's box and is now being advertised for sale on eBay. Ghastly."
1,don't order this by mistake - it's not what you think,"This is NOT the same as Destination Moon made from The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. The reviews here are WRONG, they apply to a different video.This is one in a 13-part series called Dreams of Flight produced by the Smithsonian. It may be a wonderful documentary, I wouldn't know so ignore the score I gave it. (I got it by mistake and am exchanging it)."
5,Great SciFi prior to Space Race,My 1st recalled sci-fi space movie and brings back old memories of the sci-fi I remember opver the last 50+ years
2,Destination Moon,It's a fifty year old movie and it looks lake a fifty year old movie. Does not hold up well either as a classic or cult work
2,Poor entertainment,"If you are a sci fi buff, or a vintage film buff, or perhaps even a Heinlein buff, you may find this film interesting if not actually entertaining. If you are none of these, I suspect that you will find this film an incredible bore as I did. This film falls into that catagory that you do not watch in order to be entertained, but rather because it has received a certain amount of critical acclaim. Skip this and take a 94 minute nap and you will come out ahead."
3,A true Sci Fi Classic,Considering the era in which it was made the accuracy of the science portrayed in the movie is uncanny. The moon rocket is a classic design from the early days of sci fi movies...somewhat impractical for reality...but this is sci fi. A simple story...great special effects...fun movie to watch.
4,PRINT SUFFERS!!!!!,"This is another of Image's misses. This so-called 50th Anniversary Edition isn't much of an anniversary. This film deserves better. Most of it looks decent, but the splices really add up and get quite annoying."
3,Pal's first classic,"I now own several George Pal films on DVD.This one is not one of his best as far as holding up for todays viewer but considering it is now 61 years old it is amazing. I never saw it as a kid so that might be one reason it ranks lower for me.The print has good color and is clear but it shows wear and tear.I think it is worth the $7.00 I spent to see what they were doing back in the 50's.I can see things in this film that have been used in laters films so its influence is great.In the Star Trek episode ""The Naked Time"" there is a song that is sung about Christine and it is played in this film on harmonica so I think that is an homage.The animation used to explain things at one point with Woody Woopecker is used in Jurasic Park so I know Speilberg is a fan. Those are two things off hand."
3,WARNING - NOT CAPTIONED,"This otherwise excellent Geroge Pal movie, fully restored, and one of the only ones where Robert Heinlein participated in the production, is useless to anyone with a hearing impairment.Nade Williams Collections, Corinth Films and Image Entertainment have produced this movie and another like it, (Rocket XM) which I purchased, and neither of them are captioned.Having recently lost my hearing, I depend on Closed Captioning for nearly everything on TV or video. Therefore, these old classics which I wanted for my own are worthless in their present condition."
4,Amazing Tales,"This film shows us that it was important to beat the russians at any cost and that in goverment wasn't going to do that private business would have to foot the bill. It was important to remember that russia now have the atomic bomb and could if built a platform in space take control of the world. And it gives us a warning that man is falible and that a trip like this has many dangers and if we don't do it on the first try that we should keep going til we succeed most of these early works have the same message. some will find this boring but it wasn't made for our day and age, it was made for people coming out of ww2 and was ment to show what space travel would be like and could happen if we had the money and drive."
4,"kind of fun to watch, much better than some early scifi","You have a patriotic industrialist to do the job the U.S. govt. couldn't, that's a common theme of the time as were many other elements of the movie. In spite of that it was a fun movie to watch, even with the cheap spacesuits(of course no one had ever seen one in 1950)and the inaccurate lunar surface (hadn't really seen that either)Actually the Woody Woodpecker cartoon shown to garner fellow industrialist's support early in the movie was the weirdest part. Today that would get you less respect than showing slides of the Face on Mars, I can't imagine anyone ever really doing that."
3,Lots of what it is not,A solid treatment of the written history regarding Stonehenge. The author likes to chuckle at all the theories he believes are incorrect about the origins of the site. However the author spends more time pointing out how everyone else is incorrect rather than providing summaries of any new likely theories as to it's origin and function. For me I was disappointed by this ommission and feel it is unfair to bash others opinions without presenting in equal detail your own.
5,Best book on Stonehenge. Available from Amazon.com.,I've read a good bit about Stonehenge over the years. I've seen it once once on a personal trip to England. So far this is the book to buy! Available from Amazon.com.Chippendale kindly leaves out most of the accumulated hype and hyperbole about the monument and lets thething speak for itself. Beautifully illustrated. Mercifully free of scientific jargon.
3,Ok book,This book is okay. There are a lot of cool things to see in the U.S. and this book does point you to where to go to find them. I do wish that it was in order by state and not attraction.
2,What Happened EA?,"I must say that this game left me puzzled a bit. The last game I played was Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 and I loved it. I put down the controller for a bit to focus on advancements for my career and I come back to this? What happened EA, I mean the shape stick as described in other reviews is hard to grasp and near impossible when tapping the L1 button. The character selection sucks and not there are not as many choices as previous game versions. Also I played the game for three hours straight and finally I had to turn the console off I was so frustrated. I am glad the nightmare is over and the game was only a rental. I bought the 05' version here and hopefully I will enjoy that much better."
2,"Crashes, bugs, poor course selection","I used the 3-click swing with Tiger Woods 2004& 5 & it worked fine. However, I built a new computer, AMD 64x2 dual core processor, 2GB ram, dual SLI video cards..everything on this computer works fine EXCEPT TW 2005&6. 3 click swing much too choppy, especially on putts..dual game pad screws up after 9 holes or so..swing stops at ball but charges a stroke..I have to save game & resume later. Difference between novice & intermediate is much too severe..shoot in the upper 50's & low 60's with intermediate game pad, wouldn't break 95 with intermediate.Courses aren't as good as 2004 or 2005. Why you can't use courses from previous versions, like Links, is beyond me.Tech support has one answer..unload everything before playing. That's the programmers' job..to make the program run without crashing without blaming other programs.All in all, a disappointment"
4,"good game, could be better","Tiger 2006 is a fun game. Love the rivals mode, love all the old timey clubs and outfits, love the courses. But there are 2 things that stink. One, there are some ""impossible"" pin locations that are cut on rediculous slopes, where if you miss the hole by even an inch the ball rolls off the green 99% of the time. And the gamebreaker thing is supposed to give you a great shot, but how come when I use it goes in the water or a bad lie half the time?"
2,Good thing this is a rental.,"I can safely say that I won't buy this game after renting it. The graphics are nice, the sound is nice, and the create-player option is nice, but the gameplay is extremely frustrating, and the commentators are very rude and insulting."
2,Controllers? What controllers,"This is my first EA PGA game, and I first tried the Logitech wireless rumble pad, didn't work, works fine in control panel, but not at all in the game. So, Like a complete idiot, I went out and bought the Logitech Dual controller that had EA compatible directly on the box front, although it didn't list PGA 06, the directions in the EA PGA box listed it specifically, and same results as the rumblepad. Am I missing something. Works fine with a trackball mouse, except for the frequent lockup in the backswing, causing my drive to be 27 yards, and the commentary not matching the shot, and it making me not able to switch clubs from a LW on a 97 yard shot that takes me 3 swings to go 97 yards. Other than that, it works fine...... Can anyone help me on the controller issue? mgeske at mt dot gov."
2,What happened?,"Prior to buying this game, I have owned both TW 2002 and 2004. I was really hoping that the 2006 version would bring the game to the next level. I can honestly say that this game is no better than the 2002 version and maybe a little worse than 2004. I agree with the other reviewers: rent the game before buying. You will probably be disappointed.The one thing this game does improve upon is the tournament competition. You likely will no longer be winning tournaments by 30+ strokes. However, you will probably still win every tournament without much difficulty, but it may only be by 5-10 shots. I actually like the change in the putting controls as this makes putting slightly harder and less predictable.Menus are not as intuitive as they have been in previous versions and loading times for each step are pretty poor. Game face is really not improved (I actually think it is worse than 2004).I have been a huge fan of previous versions of this game, but I am disappointed in this edition."
3,Not worth the money,"This is the worst Tiger Woods game to date. Action is slow, controls confusing, characters are lame. Do not waste your money"
4,Stop Whining,"This is the first Tiger woods game I have bought. When I looked the game up to see the reviews on it after I bought it I was shocked at the low score it had. I think the game is awesome!! I was looking for a game that was fun but also realistic. This is both. I must warn that it does take a round or two to get used to the controls but I figured it out without even looking at the instructions.If you are looking for something that is easy to play, buy Hot shots golf or something cartoonish like that. But this is a great game."
1,What Happened?,"I am in shock at how bad this game is. I have loved every Tiger game to come out in past years. The graphics got worse, the game play is pathetic, and the menus are just not user friendly. The new dual control only makes things frustrating. The new voice addition to your player is almost as annoying as listening to Michael Moore. This game sucks! The only logical thing that I can think of; EA made this Tiger game exclusively for the next generation consoles like Xbox 360. EA must have used most of their resources to make this game for the more powerful systems and just put the scraps into the regular consoles. The evidence is in the graphics, they are equivalent to PS1 plus the game play is leggy. I am rattled that such a great title has gone from top notch to worthless. Maybe the Xbox 360 version will be a revolution in the Tiger series, but until then, don't buy this game without renting it first. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
1,Pile of turds..beware of this game at all costs!!,"I just picked this game up because someone ordered it and never picked it up. I have to say, as a fan of 2001-2005 I am HIGHLY disappointed with this release!!! They changed everything that made the old games fun!! The graphics suck massive ass, they changed up the swing mechanics, and the ""customize your own character"" feature sucks as well.I have never in my life put in a game and want to throw it away after 5 minutes of playing it. I could resell it but I feel like I want to destroy it somehow. It was the biggest waste of money and time I have ever experienced. Surely Ea Sports had someone test the game out before they put it out. But it doesn't surprise me that they would make a shotty version of this game for the ""older"" console systems now that they are putting out the new PS# and XBOX 360 systems.Oh, how I love this industry!!"
1,Make That No Stars,"I had a warm and fuzzy place in my heart for EA, as much as one can feel that way for a corporate entity. They'd always produced such a high-quality product in this series. Now, it seems, they've decided to just take the money and run. I may be naive, but how can they face their loyal customers after pulling a slimy stunt like this? Who approved alienating their long-time customers for a quick, and smaller, profit. They've poisoned the well; no longer will we rush out and purchase each new version of TW PGA Tour sight-unseen. I can only imagine that they're thinking that this is the last go-round for PS2, and that they can get away with pulling this fast one because no one will remember in the flush of PS3's introduction next year. Che disgrazia!"
1,Self-Delusion,"Though this book seems like a nice collection of quotes related to the art of the being present, it does not bring any meaningful teaching on its own. In fact, this book was really done by one of Robert Burton's devoted student who did the research on her own while the cult leader Robert Burton was sexually abusing his students. Over the lifetime of the cult, it is well-known that Robert Burton had sex with well over 1000 heterosexual men against their will claiming it is a necessary step towards enlightment. This delusional man sees himself as a Goddess in a man's body and leaves a luxurious lifestyle while he pumps all the money he can from his followers. Though a charismatic leader with naive followers, his intellectual abilities are quite limited. Now at 70, he organizes frequent group sex with men. If you are curious to meet a psychopath, make sure to join his cult."
4,A book of quotes not a series of talks. Still very good.,"This is a book of quotes by the Author arranged by subject and bound together as a book. When I read the description I thought it was a series of Talks like Ouspensky's ""Fourth Way"" or ""The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution"". In this book Burton focuses on the main tenant of the Fourth Way which is the practice of ""Self-Remembering"". Burton seems well read as he quotes many famous authors who one gets the impression that Burton believes are beyond men numbers 1, 2 and 3 especially Goethe. At times one wonders if Burton is speaking beyond his experience. A very curious quote in the book is ""After many years of teaching, I have tired of the novelty of the system except for self remembering."""
1,Complete rubbish and deception,This man has numerous law suits filed against him. This should be verifiable on the the internet. Beware.
5,Breathing new life into ancient ideas,"Anyone can collate works of eminent men. But here is a man who can understand and interate them into a consistent whole. This author can breath new life into these ideas.Furthermore, he can translate them to us in the language of the heart. Although it isn't easy or comfortable news, Burton shows us the possibilities."
2,self-remembering is overrated,"There are no causes in the observable world only effects. Knowing this distinction is different than knowing about this distinction.The teacher will create specific conditions for the student. The student will see the effects without seeing the cause. They'll ask ""why"" (is the teacher doing this) rather than ""how."" Self-remembering may provide the student with some insight about the process they are participating in with the teacher, but of itself self-remembering is overrated as is this book. But if this book brings someone to become under the influence of a teacher who can create the right conditions then it was worth the investment, otherwise it is just entertainment."
3,Problem with one of the conclusions made by the author,"There is a problem with one of the conclusions made by the author. I discuss it in a review essay in the British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Nov. 1998. In the same essay I also review Fighting World War Three from the Middle East: Allied Contingency Plans, 1945-1954."
3,Leopard FLannel Sheets,"Unfortunately, the heavily dyed print detracts from the softness of the flannel. As we wash them, they get softer and more faded. My teen loved them!"
4,An good job of explaining this often over looked material!,"The author does a good job of explaining this often over looked material. The introductory chapters are very well written and the explanations are complete.Most of the other books I have read do little in the area of DLSw+ this book is the exception. For gaining a better understanding of Desktop Protocols, I would suggest this book."
2,at least you're not paying alot for what is basically nothin,"this is basically a picturebook with scenes from the movie - you won't see any pictures you didn't see in the movie. a short paragraph is included for each page, which reads like a book you would read to a 4 yr old at bedtime. the 2 stars are for 1) the photos, and 2) the low price"
3,Nice Pictures!!!,I bought the book and I gave it the 3 stars because every page has photos from the movie and for its budget price. The story is narrated so that a young child can read it too. More a collectors piece than for a good read!
3,There really is not much to this book.,"For those of you who haven't seen the scrap book in the bookstores, this is basically a collection of scenes from the movie with a short paragraph on each page which summarizes the movie. That said, there's really not much to this book although there are some nice pictures in it. It would probably only appeal to the die-hard fans who want to collect all the x-files merchandise out there. The good thing is, it is a very inexpensive title. For those who want an in depth look at the movie should read the novelization and/or purchase the Making of the X-files Movie instead."
5,Excellent!,"I ordered this when I saw it, and I think it's a really great book. Really great pictures, I have two copies. It's also a really good price. I love it, Fight the Future is the best."
2,Two words - Buy Camtasia!,"I picked Adobe Captivate over Camtasia because of their reputation. Boy was I wrong. For creating web demos, Captivate is nothing more than a gloried version of Powerpoint. It does not record dynamic content on a web page (like Flash, movies, or AJAX activity), and cannot keep up with multiple web page clicks. I get many blank slides and off kilter slides that take me hours to edit.If you are looking for true webcasting software, but Camtasia."
2,A great kids book,"This book is thin with wide margins, big print and short on creative ideas. It offers only common sense simplistic ideas (ie: wear a name tag) that anyone could figure out on their own. No innovation here."
3,good bang for the buck,"just discovered the flower kings in the last few years. roinne stolt is one of the greatest guitarist and vocalists making music today. i can't understand how bands like dream theater, porcupine tree, transatlantic get virtually no airplay. no mention of their new releases in the newspaper or ANYWHERE! put out some rap crap or R&B garbage and you win a grammy or an OSCAR! for music from a movie.how in the hell did that happen. just another sign of the apocolypse. thank god i have AOL music which has a progressive radio station. wall street voodoo is good but it is no ADAM and EVE, easily the best flower kings cd. buy the flower kings DVD, dream theater live in Budakon DVD, Transatlantic DVD. get a good pair of headphones and try to pretend it is 1975 when ELP, YES, and KING CRIMSON ruled the world."
3,"Applaud the effort, but this is not that good","I'm a big fan of Roine Stolt and I've always been impressed with the Flower Kings and Roine's side projects, but I didn't find much of anything too enjoyable here (pushing the skip button alot!). First of all, I'm aware that the theme with this release is a tribute to his influences, which are not necessarily prog rock. I'm all for that, but these songs are all fairly boring. It seems that many of the songs have the same 'feel' and tempo and are lenghty without any decent changes in mood, tempo, or theme. As a guitar player, I enjoyed the guitar work on this album, but I would rather listen to well crafted songs than just simple-structed background rythms to support guitar soloing. Roine also sprinkles a good amount of political rhetoric in his songs here that I find distracting and ill-placed in the lack-luster compositions. I applaud the effort, but was generally dissapointed."
5,Not much to review,"AS advertised, Cross pen refills. Not much to review, shipped on time like Amazon always does. Were regular refills also as advertised."
2,Pass,I'm not enamored by this hiking series. I think it could go into more trail detail. Some of the trail descriptions were real fuzzy and oftentimes wrong. An overall good map is sadly missing. Not a bad book but choose another if you're looking for accuracy.
5,Best Way to Spend Your Day!,The Bay Area has so much to offer and this author doesn't miss a beat when it comes to hiking. Fabulous hikes with varies degrees of difficulty in gorgeous locations. I love this book not only for its detail but also for the informational sidelines along the way. I feel like the author is hiking alongside me. It's the bomb!
2,Disappointing,"A big disappointment in my view. Yes, it goes back to the ""Racine"" period, but without the up-tempo songs. This CD is in dire need of some good old rock songs, but most of the songs are ballads, and not very good ones either. This can't hold a candle to ""Racine"" and ""Rats"". I always loved her voice, but I began to take a dislike to her voice on this CD, she seems to be singing differently from her old CD's. I recommend that you listen to it carefully before you purchase it, I wish I had done that..."
5,She did it again!,I love all Her cds pretty much...But this goes back to Her Rats & Racine cds....Which are my 2 favs! A Must have!
4,Great resource for Plumbers.,"The author, whom has written a number of other titles on this same subject, has a wealth of knowledge about all facets of Plumbing. What is also notable as well as commendable is when reading his books, you get the feeling that he really likes this field. If Plumbing is your business, then it would be to your advantage to have this as well as some of Woodson's other titles in your collection. This book doesn't pretend to be any more than a vast, comprehensive reference tool--and in my opinion, succeeds. This is the book that you have in your truck if you are a plumber or on the shelf beside your desk if you are a designer. My only criticism (a minor one) is the lack of explanation of pumps and their sizing. Some charts and diagrams are offered but no explanation is given as a follow through. Overall though, I recommend the text as great reference resource every plumber should have."
4,Nice,"All three of my boys (ages 7.5, 6 and 3.5) really like playing with these figures. One of them had an arm come off fairly soon, but it went back on easily. They have had hours of fun ""playing Godzilla""."
1,Not what is in the picture!!!!!!!!!,The cross necklace they sent me looks NOTHING like the picture. It is a totally different necklace. Don't purchase this--you can find something better.
2,Not a Great Textbook,If you are looking for the philospohy of how urban planning has been viewed through time then maybe this is the book for you. However as a text book it lacks a clear presentation of the information and is incredibly dull. When you read the chapters you have to continually look back at the overview to remember what they are rambling on about. I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does have a nice discussion on the philosophy of urban planning.
3,Book review,To much information is packed into this book. I think the author could've cut some of the information out.
3,"Tough Sleeve for 2 1/4"" bats",My sons use them evrytime we go to cage to practice--my one son has had great sucess whil other goes thru sleeves like water--he has fantastic wrist action when he swings and it seems they only last a few weeks to a month for heim
4,BUY IT,This cd is great. I first heard about it from a friend and was surprised how good it is. Great songwriting. fun songs. Actually sounds like an artist created it and that it wasn't written by the Nashville 3000 LyriCreator Machine that seems so popular now. And the band sounds like they really enjoy playing their own music. Can't wait for the video!
4,Surprisingly Scary,"The cover of this book, a girl eating an all-day sucker, is misleading. This is the tale of a small town in New York and the horror that comes to visit one day.Things start when a young boy disappears while sneaking to a local pool. His disappearance is not the last as someone else disappears every day. The manhunt grows but we get glimpses that there is far more than just missing people at stake.Something is going on in the town and it could affect the world as we know it. Some readers may be a little confused at first but fans of the Cthulhu Mythos and H.P. Lovecraft will recognize some of the imagery.Finally, the forces of good and sanity pull together for a final confrontation before all hell breaks loose. How it ends will have to be left for the reader to discover. Well-done."
4,hard worker,"I bought this mower 6 years ago, my son and i mowed lawns for the son to have extra money. we needed a better mower and found this one to be onsale. we liked the rear wheel drive, as we found that with front wheel drives as the bagger fills the weight tends to lift the front, then you have to lift the handle bars to get traction, not with this modle. this mower is the older briggs 6hp and has been worked to death(with proper maintenance)and a lot of parts have been changed or removed but, it is still working and i will buy another one!"
1,fraud,"the mower arrived in a box that had been opened, probably by many people, I don't know. the unit was listed as new, which it looked, as far as the lawnmower itself. the reason it was new was that it wouldn't start. in fact I think so many people had been sucked into buying this unit that the starter rope wouldn't even retract when I started to try myself for the first time. clearly this is false advertising. compound that with the explicit instructions that it cannot be returned and you have a full blown fraud scheme. is Amazon listening? this was a unit listed in the amazon store section, not an item listed by an individual, so clearly amazon should step up and take this back and destroy it when they get it back. this is not helping their image one bit. in fact I may never shop with them again if this gets any worse."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I received this as a gift from a friend who knew I was about to buy it. I cannot believe how bad this game is.The questions and answers are extremely long, so once you read them out of course you will be asked to repeat them. The answers as others say are debatable and often seem a matter of opinion.I have got this game out at 2 parties with 2 groups of friends, and it has bombed every time. I tried playing teams so more people could be involved with each turn but that still did not work.Stay away from this game, maybe try smartass it is a fun game."
1,The name kinda says it...,"The worst case scenario would be playing this game. I was very disappointed when I bought it. Facts are interesting, but that's about it. I'd rather read the facts in a fun little book than play a game based on it. Not worth your money (unless you buy this game off of me, just kidding)."
4,The Big Blow,Very interesting short novel written in Joe Lansdale's unique style. This story takes place in 1900 in Galveston Texas. Lots of characters for a short novel and the main character changes his name from Lil Arthur to Jack. It's boxing and a hurricane. Lots of excitement.
1,"Too much like ""church-ianity "" ...",To me it reeked of judgmental preaching. I couldn't read the whole book. I love A Course In Miracles. I'm just glad I read it before this book or I most likely would not have read ACIM.
3,So so,"Bought this for our office bathroom. Love the fact it is an automatic air freshener, love the fragrances that fit it, but it goes off too frequently and it cannot be adjusted. Should have purchased the more expensive model so I had that option. I have to turn each morning and turn it off each evening or the fragrance is just too strong."
1,THIS BOOK AND CASSETTE ARE USELESS WITHOUT THE VIDEO OR TV.,THIS BOOK KEEPS REFERING TO THE VIDEO AND TELEVISION SHOW THAT IT GOES ALONG WITH. WITHOUT EITHER ONE IT IS USELESS TO THE AVERAGE PERSON. YOU ALSO CAN'T RETURN IT ONCE IT IS OPEN. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU ARE TAKING THE FULL TV AND VIDEO COURSE.
2,Old Style RPG Good Story Average Game Play,"I like tactics type games, and Vandal Hearts (the first one) was a lot of fun. I was put off by the second one because they totally changed the fighting system. Instead of a turn based system, where all of your members move, then all of the computer's members move, you input the move for one of your characters and the computer does the same. THen the player and computer characters move simultaneously. Essentially, you have to try to outguess the computer. It was sort of interesting at first, then, as you add more party members, it gets really hard. Once you get the hang of it, it gets almost ridiculously easy (with some notable exceptions). I found I had to force myself to finish this game, but I did enjoy the ending. Don't think I'll ever play it again."
2,"Take my word for it, this RPG isn't one you would buy.","I'm sorry to say, but this game is just awful. The characters are bland and do not develop through the game. The plot lacks any intersting twists, and the graphics are just bad. Also, there is no variety in mission objectives, I's just ""Kill all enemies"". Take my word for it, this game is just not interesting."
2,Vandel Hearts 2 Another Dumb sequil,"I've allways said the only series where the sequil wasn't worse then the orginial was the FF series, and VH/VH2 is no exception. I enjoyed the orignial VH so figured I would try the second one. I was very confused by the battle system, even though a plus is that it became very difficult for you to win battles now because of the constantly moving char's. The job system was very hard to get the hang of and had nothing I found immensly rewarding to intregue me enough to work with my jobs. Plus the fact that the magic was very low scale (even less then VH 1) and that the job class made no sence just made me dislike this game. If you want to play a RPG/strategy game. Try VH1 or Final Fantasy Tatics. This isn't worth it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this game because I really like RPG's, BIG mistake! This isn't a true RPG this is a story game, This game is boring, the game is one big video and the only part you have in it is the battles that are annoying and don't have that something that games like Final Fantasy has, you also get to make the OCCASIONAL decision for the hero. The weapons are basic and boring with the only variation being in the stats and spells. The graphics are terrible, I've seen better graphics on a SNES!The music is resonible but a bit repeditive with not much variation from song to song. The story is boring with the biggest twist being a traitor and a war. The story also jumps without much explanation, and as usual everyone is in love with the main character or his friends.My suggestion is don't buy this game, wasting money on lollies will give you longer enjoyment! It looks like Konami have made another terrible RPG. If you like RPG's stick to SquareSoft and the Final Fantasy series."
2,Chrono Cross,"I was really dissapointed with this game. The game play went ok, but there were wayyyy too many characters in the game. It reminded me of Final Fantasy too much. I think that the game designers were Final Fantasy programmers on a severe amount of Heroin."
5,Always a winner,"I love Cathe Friedrich. She is by far my favorite as far as exercise DVD's. I wanted a cardio workout that was challenging but without all the jumping up and down. This is exactly what I was looking for. I almost think it is more difficult than all the jumping around. Using your legs to push the gliding discs move really expends alot of energy. I use paper plates for the gliding discs as suggested by another review and they work just fine. Low impact does not mean this is an easy DVD, it simply means no jumping but no less challenging in my opinion. I love all the premixes, her DVD's are usually more exspensive but you get several different workouts in one DVD which adds variety. I also like the bonus step workout!"
5,Great Macro Lens,"I spent a month or two researching macro lenses before finally settling with the tamron 90mm, and I really couldn't be happier with my decision. I was also considering the sigma 105mm and the canon 60mm, but ultimately I decided to go with this one because I wanted a lens that could double as a portrait lens and work as a macro where I could have some distance from my subject. I got it to shoot flowers and bugs primarily, and since I am terrified of (and deathly allergic to) the latter, I opted for the 90mm. I absolutely love this lens. I find that I am favoring it over my canon 28-105mm as a general use lens. Cost was definitely a deciding factor, and as a hobby for an amateur photographer like myself, this lens is ideal both financially and artistically."
5,Great Macro/Portrait lens,"I wanted to get into macro photography and decided on Tamron because of the rebate offer. I was truly blown away on how sharp this lens performed. It has also double as a great portrait lens. On my Rebel XT, the focal length actual equals 144mm which gives great heads shots. The focusing is slightly slow but that didn't bother me any. Once you look at the results from this lens you it's a no brainer."
2,Not rocket science,"I was hoping for a book that offered some real value - an easy to read, quick to digest volume that provided some real insight. But this is basic content that may be of value to those who have never taken a picture before, most likely using the ""professional techniques"" verbiage in the title to attract more buyers. It certainly got me!"
1,PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR THE WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER,This is a horrible book. The writing is bad and the photography is even worse.It is not even worth the shipping charge.
3,So-So,"Didn't find this book all that great. Some information was very useful, but much of it was too simplistic, or even outdated. You can't shoot modern weddings like you did in 1970, and this book had some example shots that seemed very old-school.I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't go to this book first when I'm looking for new, exciting ideas when shooting weddings."
3,Overrated,"I am a beginning photographer but after having reviewed Digital Wedding Photography by Ken Johnson, this book I would say is a distant 3rd. Overall the book is well very simple, well written but low on explaning tecniques. This book dealt with more emphasis on wedding workflow from the dressing room to church and beyond. As a photographer I think we all know that already....I would have been happy if emphasis was put on techniques and tips on how to capture the moment. If this was my first book I may have been impressed with it but sorry folks Ken's book is far more superior in quality overall."
3,Too Vague Not Enough Detail,"It wasn't what I thought it would be (I was hoping more detailed and step by step). It has a lot of great information about wedding photography, but doesn't go into enough detail to be helpful in taking the shots. I don't feel any more comfortable about doing a wedding from reading this book. It does provide a good script for the newer wedding photographer, but falls short by generalizing. It talks about techniques in taking shots, but doesn't go into the details about those techniques. It left me with more questions than answers. It's not the all inclusive guide. You will need additional books (or experiences) to round out where this one leaves you."
2,Only for film photographers,"I got this book hoping for info geared for digital photography, it has none. The book was written when digital photography was just becoming popular. It is good for formal wedding posing ideas, but it gives no technical info for digital photography. All of the info is based on using film."
1,There are better wedding photography books,"I purchased this book first, read it in a day, and haven't looked at it again. The most useful elements were the business section: it has a mockup of a contract and other information on business and legal issues. Otherwise I found the book less than useful. The photos aren't very impressive, rendering the advice a little suspect. There isn't very much technical information about posing or lighting, it's all generalized and vague. Nor are there wedding-related tips, most of the advice in this book could be summed up by ""know how to work your camera"". I went to the bookstore and picked up Wedding Photography by Mark Cleghorn, which was much more useful. I recommend you look elsewhere for wedding photography books."
1,Outdated Style,This is a very outdated book. The images are very dated and the style is too stiff. I am guessing that the pictures were old when the book was originally published in 2001. If you fancy yourself as a contemporary photographer then look elsewhere.I recommend looking up The Top 10 Wedding Photographers in Popular Photography. Their styles are fresh even if some of them like Jerry Ghionis are highly posed. Even Jerry's work doesn't have a posed look to it.
3,Nice pictures,I bought this book to get pointers to shooting weddings. It really didn't help me that much but it does have some nice pictures.
4,Hybrid Heaven = Hybrid Greatness,"Hybrid Heaven is a game fully worth checkng out especially if you are into RPG's or action games. Hybrid Heaven mixes a mysterious twisting plotline with a totally revolutionary fight sequence with combos, weapons, wrestling type throws, and hand to hand fighting. The graphics of this game are nothing too spectacular, but certain enemies and parts do look really fantastic! Now, although I like this game I admit that it sometimes has awkward camera angles which can make things a little difficult, but this game is also great because it is an RPG (role playing game)in which you can talk with other people, search through levels collecting items, and bring tactics into battle."
2,simply boring,"This game did not live up to my expectations. The graphics are solid and the story's all right, but the pace is SLOW. The biggest problem with this game is the battles. It tries to put together the best aspect of fighting games and RPG battle systems, and it simply doesn't work. Trust me, this should not be called an RPG. Of course there are some people who'll love this game, but you probably aren't one of them, and so should rent instead of buying."
5,yeahbaby,THIS GAME IS AWESOME ITS LIKE GOLDEN EYE BUT WITH OUT MULTIPLAYER THE STORY LINE IS'NT HELPFUL BUT THE GRAPHICS PAY FOR THAT
5,Viva Galliano!,"Awesome accordianist--one of the best, with a terrific band to boot. Also, check out his album French Touch. I looked around a long time to find music with this vibe!"
1,Dissapointing,"When I ordered this particular cd I was expecting typical latin music that I love to listen. Unfortunately not even close perhaps 0ne or two [ieces were OK but the rest, I can't even stand it."
4,fun li'll gadget,"This controller is exactly what it's cracked up to be: affordable, versatile, and compact. The simple LCD feedback is surprisingly excellent, the keys, knobs, wheels all have a familiar, reliable feel. I simply plugged it into the usb, it got power, xp recognized it as a midi audio something or other, and I was immediately sending midi signals to Live.Cons: One knob only registers ~100 degrees (not the full 270 or whatever). Not a big deal.Also, the included VST instrument software isn't working with Live right now, and the error message + help documentation is weak.Overall, I look forward to exploring what I can do with this. It's small size and power-via-usb is a huge plus for mobility!"
5,What can I say...This is my THIRD purchased copy! Zoltan is phenominal...,"OK...If you are a lover of impressionist/romantic era music that ill-defines Debussy contribution, you owe it to yourself to get this album of Zoltan Kocsis playing Debussy. It is masterful, especially Images 1 and II. Although there were several places in the album that I disagree with Zoltan's interpretation of the piece -- one part in L'Isle Joyeuse comes to mind that he slows down like way too much -- it is, by far, my FAVORITE Debussy album and the ONLY one I've purchased 3 times.I study Zoltan's renditions repeatedly and, at times, play to them. I never tire of hearing them. This CD has inspired me to take on and attempt to master some of Debussy's most challenging masterpieces for solo piano. Guess that's why I am on my third CD."
5,i love those guys,"with no doubt,this was the best game i've ever played.. the characters were cool ,the places were so beautiful.. actually this game made me really crazy about japan."
3,A bit too challenging,"At first I thought this game was fun, but then I thought it was too challenging. The first level is really hard because of all the gaps you have to jump through. And you want to know the worst part is? Well, if you get a game over, you have to restart from the beginning and make your way back to the boss. In Zelda games, they will at least give you a secret shortcut.I will recommand you to buy Mystical Ninja for N64 than this game."
5,Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus,My 5 year old daughter loves this game. It has two levels of difficulty. She plays in the easy mode. She beggs to play this game and is disappointed when it is time to stop. An excellent purchase for anyone who is looking to introduce the younger girl to GBA.
1,Stay away from this product,"Was recognized in windowsXP and Linux (redHat and ubuntu) with no problems, BUT it would not work with 2 different esata devices using 2 different cables. Windows will show the device connected half the time and then fail.... not worth returning for $6. This was not a driver/config issue, it was just a really cheap item issue."
1,wwe Extreme Rules,I don't know if this years wwe Extreme Rules pay per view is going to be a good pay per view because not every wwe Pay Per View is good but if this years wwe Extreme Rules Pay Per View is going to be good my dad and I are going to Order it on Pay Per View.
4,Great fundamentals on JFace frameworks,"This book is well written. The narrative flows conversationally and keeps your interest throughout the chapter. This book gives you a fundamental understanding of the architecture of SWT and especially of JFace. It puts the pieces together for you. Whether you are writing desktop gui applications, Eclipse plug-ins, or Eclipse Rich Client Platforms (RCP) applications, this book is an excellent starting point. Unfortunately, the chapter on RCP was full of errors and the application example did not run. But all the other book's examples ran without any errors. And its excellent explanations of the JFace frameworks make the book worth having."
2,Poor reference,"This text may work as a simple introduction to SWT and JFace, but it is a VERY poor reference material for the minutae that is what makes SWT and JFace challenging to use. I would NOT recommend it to anyone."
2,not what I expected,"Just needed a book on SWT... made a poor choice. I don't know if my review will be helpful... unless you are like me, and just needed SWT... I don't use JFace much so this book was wasted on me."
5,Boat-owner's widow's suspicions confirmed. Proper hilarity.,"Recommended for the woman who has definitely figured out her spouse, boyfriend, brother, dad, etc. and still can't believe it. MacManus takes us into the mind of the fisherman in this tale. Even my husband (who has difficulty laughing at himself) laughed at this tape despite himself. A great gift for anyone who's ever planned a fishing trip, bought a rod and reel, and especially for the boat owner's ""widow."""
2,Worst Album Ever From One Of My Favorite Bands,"I'm a huge fan of ELP and have seen them live several times during their heyday. I still regularly listen to their music, but this is probably the worst album they released.From what I hear, it was a released to fulfill a contractual obligation and it really shows. It marks the end of an era with the band.If you're a completionist, then by all means, buy it. But do give a listen to each track first. It's not up to their normally stellar standards.I was deeply disappointed with this album and it's the only ELP album I own that I didn't purchase again in CD or MP3 format."
4,Fun Design,This cake is a big hit at parties. It is a bit time consuming but the results are worth it.
2,doesn't work very well,"Like others have said, I discovered the checkerboard insert does not work. At all. It slides around in the pan and doesn't fully reach the bottom. The only way I could get it to work was to have someone else pressing down on the plastic insert. Lame."
1,Troubles with it,"Like others said, the insert doesn't fit the pans very well and moves around when filling with batter. It was a frustrating process. I am updating my review after cutting into the cake. Just looked like a marble cake. Not even close to a checkered one."
1,"cheap pans, plastic ring doesnt fit",I had this set of pans about 6 years ago and it was much higher quality. The 3 pans i had were very heavy and well made and the plastic ring actually fit and gripped the sides. It made a beautiful cake. I have since lost the ring so i reordered the whole set and was so disappointed when i received it today. The pans are a poor lightweight quality and the ring does not fit correctly in the pan at all. it just spins around. I will have to make do as this cake is for a birthday. Will have my sister hold it in place while i fill it i guess.I do not recommend this product.
2,disappointing cake pan,"I was disappointed by the insert in this cake pan. It does not evenly fit the bottom or reach the sides properly so that it slides around when you try to put the batter in, creating a smeared layer effect. The pans themselves are a fine quality but it's really hard to work with. I've tried several times, with someone holding the insert to try and keep it from sliding and I've ended up with off-center, smeared layers and weird looking cakes. It would really work better if the insert clipped down to the pan. The plastic is too light and the batter ""lifts"" it as you put it in."
2,Um.....You can't change physics.,"My older sister bought this for me as a birthday gift, (I bake....a lot)and i was super excited. But before I even used the product you KNOW as an intelligent human that thick batter will move that flimsy plastic insert (that has so side clips or rubberized edge to stop batter bleeding)in a nanosecond. In short- this product can NEVER be used as intended with a perfect result.However, if you're like me and refuse to be bettered by something as sad as this, you take a different approach. Using this insert as a ""cookie cutter"" of sorts will product the perfect cut outs to assemble a perfectly executed checkerboard cake. Hence at least 2 stars.Hope it helps"
4,A classic is improved,"Twenty five years ago I used this product for many birthdays. People were always amazed at the checkerboard pattern and I revealed no secrets! I lost many kitchen items to Hurricane Ike; when my thirty year-old son came down for the Fourth of July, I decided to use my new checkerboard cake set. The pans are of a better quality, and the secret to the cake, is now made of a high quality plastic instead of aluminum. The only thing I wish the insert had were the old built-in ""clips"" at the ends of insert that helped keep it in place. Otherwise, it is ""more perfect"" and produces an amazing cake! Try white cake mix and Red Velvet mix.Yum."
2,Where did it all screw up?,When I first got this game I have to admit I was excited.I tried it out at a friends and loved it but that was not my final say.I loaded it out and I was DISAPOINTED.the gameplay was slow the charachters were choppy and the line of boxers could of been better and bigger.OH yeah!theres customizing boxers but that feels somewhat mediocre.Finalsay: Even hardcore boxing fans might want to skip this one.And dont even bother renting even thats a waste of money.
1,wish i could give it 1/2 star,"I tried to like this game, I really did. Especially since i spent so much money on it. The main problem wih it is the graphics. They look stupid. I am not sure if they meant for the models to look like monkeys but they do. Also you can punch right through your opponent. My next main problem is in the game play. Its really slow and that made it very hard to enjoy fighting. I have played all the fight games on PS and this is by far the worst of the worst. Now I am sure all you people will bag on me for saying so, but this game is LAME."
3,"HIGH HOPE, LOW LET DOWN.","I WAS DISUSSED WITH THIS GAME.EVEN WITH ALL THE OPTIONS,ACCLAIM FORGOT ABOUT THE GAME PLAY....THE GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT THE WAY THE BOXERS MOVE SUCKS.THE WAY THEY THOW PUNCHES IS TERRIBLE AND UNREALISTIC.I WILL GIVE ACCLAIM SOME CREDIT,THIS IS THERE FRIST BOXING GAME AND IT HAS A LOT OF AWSOME OPTIONS.HBO BOXING 2 SOULD BE AWSOME.THE COMBINATION OF KO KING 2001 AND HBO WOULD BE THE BEST BOXING GAME KNOWN TO MAN."
1,not a good game at all,i played it as long as i could because i wanted to like it...i love boxing games. i thought it might be good.not!dont make the same mistake i did
4,The Career mode is the best I've seen to a boxing game,"This is a very well thought out game. First of all, I like the variety of styles you can pick when creating a boxer as well as the realism of the career mode. The only bad thing about the game is its somewhat limited graphics and gameplay. As far as gameplay, it needs to be tweaked a little bit. It's like they got the majority of the game and left out some small specifics such as the announcing. I hope someone can recreate this for ps2 and get the full effect of the graphics and gameplay because if the small defects are fixed, knockout kings won't be the best boxing game for playstation."
3,Overrated,"I am sorry but the game is not that good. I concept is great but the game play could have been better. The graphics are great for a play Station and that seems to be more important than game play. Aiming is awful. You only have up, down or straight. I would like it better if it had auto aiming. Unless you are playing a first person shooter aiming should be auto. The story is boring, I do not mine long stories but the Japanese makers just did not get the American culture right in this game. The story is silly. Why would a agent have a love affair during the middle of a mission. I hated having to listen to all that nonsense when i want to shoot people. Really, it was not important to the story. I would have loved this game if the game play was different."
5,If you own a PSX then you have to own MGS,"MGS is the best action game ever made. Cool weapons, a compelling story, great graphics for it's time, and some top notch voice acting make this a classic that everyone should own. If you don't own Metal Gear Solid you can't call yourself a gamer."
4,Easy level vs. hard.,"This game held my attention until I went to the next difficulty level. I could not figure out how to destroy metal gear. The best part of the game for me is solving it, getting new items, and playing it again for a faster time, more kills, and better rating. Some hints to destroying metal gear in the hard mode would make this game more fun for me."
2,scratch,a 2 because there is a scratch on the disc that makes it freeze and i can move on.. 5 on the delivery. would look into sending it back to get a diff one but the $10 i got it for isnt really worth my time right now.
5,"Perhaps the greatest, most innovative and totally immersive game ever.","All that needs to be said about Metal Gear Solid has been said - Countless video game magazines and websites cite this game as a 'classic' or 'must-have.' I remember playing MGS at a friend's house from beginning to end when I was eight - still, nearly 11 years later, it's my favorite video game/game series."
5,This is the greatest game ever!,Metal Gear Solid is got to be one of the best games I have ever played. The game play is solid and the way it interacts with the gamer makes this one a keeper. Highly recommened!
5,A great espionage game with a story,"The minute I started playing this game I loved it. I loved the way it was setup. Unlike most games, the way you move around & shoot people, this game you have to sneak around and try not to get detected by the enemies. Your mission is to try to stop a nuclear warhead from being sent. You will use a combination of weapons ranging from the socom pistol to Stinger missles you can control. It has a great story line. You can connect to a number of people along the way to help you through codec. Once you start playing you can't stop. Overall I give it a five."
5,I was very pleased to buy it.,"The game its self is vary interesting. Unlike alot of spy games (my opinion) this game has alot of thought put into it. Unstead of being James Bond & running around with hundreds of guns blowing away guards, you are Soid Snake that has to find his own weapons to help his chantses to survive. The game has alot of plot twists & depth put into it."
5,"**The** best game for the playstation, hands down!","There is not a single game better then Metal Gear solid. I personally got this game from a friend. It was so fun, i played it for hours, days, weeks, months, going on a year. No game for the playstation or much less any other system can beat this! When metal Gear2: Sons of liberty comes out im getting a copy because this game was so good!"
2,Somewhat overrated,"Though I applaud the game designers' efforts to make a truly cinematic game, I'm afraid the effort failed. Okay, yes, with all the cut scenes and the linear plot, playing this game is much like watching a movie--but a BAD movie. The writing is pale, the voiceovers are wooden, and the graphics in the cut scenes don't pass muster. It all comes off as melodramatic, convoluted, and tedious. Minus the storyline and the cut scenes, the gameplay is pretty good, actually--maybe three and a half stars. Also, the whole thing is too easy to get through--you can do it in two days or less.I suppose that my final judgement is that for gamers over age 14 Metal Gear Solid is unegaging. That can probably be said for the vast majority of Playstation games, though.If you want a good spy story, go read a novel."
1,What is this?!,"Metal Gear Solid one of the most ever overrated and hyped game ever.You play as snake who walks like he needs to go to the bathroom trying to use stealth. It's easy just try to watch the radars and memorize their paths and walk right by them . Snake is a cheetah compared to the genomes . And when you are spotted run around for 20 seconds and they'll get tired . THis game is short too . The Vr trainiing mode is actually very good .Pros:VR Training goodMei LingSet c4 hide in air duct boom!Cons:Easy stealthVery stupid soldiersMei Ling not realMore of a 2-d gamenothing compared to tenchushortPeople hypeexpensiveoverall:not worth the hype, not worth the price. Worth a rent or $10 purchase.Score:2"
1,Metal Gear Solid= no good!,"If you took a piece of a hamster's tail and stuck it into your PlayStation it would most likely have better graphics, and more involving story-line, and a better, more fun fighting system than MGS. It stink0r5"
4,"very good, but has a few flaws","This was a decent game. Probably one of the first of its kind, so that gets it major points. It's a little on the short side (5 hours total if you watch all the cinematics and take your time) and the difficulty takes dramatic leaps and falls throughout the game, making adaptation difficult. The graphics are absolutely horrible, but maybe i'm just spoiled by my ps2. The voice quality isn't bad for a game as old as this one and the moves and strategy you can use are all immensely helpful (as opposed to some games that give you neat moves that have absolutely no application in the game). Very original."
5,Soldier Boy,"This game rules! Only the serious, die hard soldier, glory boy in us all can truelly apriciate this game. After you beat it and play it again you will notice you have some different items and a few different twists as well. I like it a lot and have beaton it over and over and over and I am stil not bored!"
5,Totally Awesome,"There's nothing new that I could possibly say about this game, other than it's really, really great."
1,Very tiny book,Very tiny book. I was not expecting such a small book. Very expensive item for its size.Book arrived with a grease stain on the cover!
5,Pound for Ounce,"Pound for ounce this may be the best book out on Lean Manufacturing. It is exactly what the publisher's book description says it is. This is a good deal, superior value at a low price."
2,Very Thin on Content,I have worked in the field of Lean and Kaizen for over 20 years and have a degree in Industrial Engineering. This book is a waste of money. Too thin and not very informative. You can boil down green beans until they are mush. This is mush.
2,So-So,"When my son is calm, this product works great. However, when he is very active for whatever reason (ie., wakes up hungry), he does indeed slide down the pad and ends up on the crib matress. He has also knocked over the sides when he waves his arms around rapidly. Note he's only 7 lbs. when this started. I feel I need to be around when he's in this incline - I would never use it overnight."
3,Not for my guy...,"I thought this was such a great product and still have some hope for it...We tried it in the craddle from the day our boy came home from the hospital (now 4 weeks old) ... but had to discontinue using it as he kept sliding down the foam pad. I love the wedges on the sides, you can sort of prop him up but we learned that rolling a blanket and laying him propped on that (like they did in the hospital) works better. This way he is on his back but propped slightly on his side to prevent choking or spitting up on himself. I don't think this product will ever work for us, but I will try it again once our guy reaches the crib."
2,Was great for a few weeks,"After my daughter got to be about a month old she kept sliding down. A few times she even moved up and her head was off the top of it. She's also kicked off the velcro wedges. Oh, and if there is an accident, forget about it. The entire foam turns yellow. The covering is also really tough to get back on once it's been washed. I was originally going to give it 3 stars cause it worked for awhile, but after reading my own review I'm changing it to two."
4,Good For Babies,"This is a must have. Keeps baby positioned comfortably and saves the mattress. Also great because you can tuck the covers under the positioner tightly, almost like swaddling.I reccommend covering with a receiving blanket or pillow case to save the fabric. and if using in bassinet or crib keep near the end so feet can touch because baby can slide down."
1,Useless!,"Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it. I could tell that she was not very comfortable. It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to. Also it is very small in size. If she did like it, it would not have lasted very long."
4,Congrestion helper,"We got this for our son when he started having a cold w/congestion. Our mattress for him is pretty firm and doesn't quite give him the incline that he needed (but it's better to have a firm mattress then not) so we looked at this. It really did seem to help. Yes there were many times that I walked in and found my little one at the bottom of this but it's not meant to hold your baby in one place. I do like the fact that you can remove the cover (but you can only on the incline not the sides)and toss it in the washer. It does leave a ""dent"" after some use but since we only needed it on occasion that was fine. But definitly a good item for little ones who need a ""lift"" when sick"
2,Loved it at first,"The first week I loved it, but then I discovered our daughter slides down. Also, the foam pad began to lose its shape. Save your money, until the manufacturer improves the product."
1,Unsafe Product Disappoints,"I had high hopes for this positioner. I ignored earlier reviews warning about the ""slide"" factor. Unfortunately it is true. My baby slid down, completely off the positioner, and UNDER her blanket. Imagine finding your infant buried under a blanket. She was 4 weeks old, and thank God she was not suffocated. We have not used it since, and I cannot recommend it because I consider it unsafe."
2,Not very durable...,"The ""memory foam"" is really a term used to put a positive spin on the fact that the foam will have an indent from the babies head after a few uses. Also, after one wash, the foam did not fit in the cover. I recommend putting something over this to prevent the need to wash the whole thing. Also, the velcro isn't attached well to the removable side wedges. As titled above, this item is not very durable."
5,Very pleased!!!!,"I got this as a gift and my baby loves it!! Sleeps comfortably and safely thanks to the side supporters which velcro to adjust to the proper size for your baby. I definitely recommend this product, it does incline the baby's head just enough so at night the baby has less spit up and can digest better, its made of that cushion which conforms to the baby's body making it very comfortable, and has the side supports for safety. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not worth it!,"This product doesn't get the job done. My son slid down it every night. I finally gave up. Also not matter how I placed the side things he always mannaged to roll onto his side. Once he got older ( 2 months) if he wasn't sliding down it, he was pushing himself up it. Then his head fell off of the top and got wedged in between this and the bumper! That is when I stopped using it.It's a great concept, just not practical."
3,Grows out of it very fast,"I bought this when my baby was about two months old and he outgrew it in a couple months. The wedge is too small. I used it in the co-sleeper and there are gaps left and right.By four and a half months and 14.5 pounds he can flip OVER the wedges when he rolls around. Also, his weight back at 13 pounds already flattened out the wedge so much that the incline was not really effective."
5,Great Product,"I give this product 5 stars. Though my daughter is almost 10 months now, we used the positioner when she was a newborn and found it worked out great. I had two: one for the crib (second floor) and one for the basinet in the pack and play (first floor).My little one preferred sleeping on her side and the positioner helped making sure she didn't roll back during her sleep.It also helped prevent ""flat-head"" as I would alternate sides every week. It payed off. Her head is a round and beautiful.One of the reviews stated the cover shrunk. I washed our covers several times and didn't have any shrinking. I just didn't dry them in the dryer. They are fine if you hung-dry them.I like them so much I recommend them to my expectant friends."
3,Not a great buy,"I bought this product because I liked that my baby could sleep on her side with her head elevated. Unfortunately, she slid down during the night, sometimes causing her clothes to bunch up around her face. That's obviously not safe. Also, the material at the top of the pillow is scratchy. My solution was to move her much lower on the pillow. She was only slightly elevated (her lower body wasn't even on the positioner), and I could still use it to help her sleep on her side. This worked for us for awhile, although in hindsight, I wonder how safe it was."
2,Baby slides down,I thought this would be a great product for our new baby but he slides down so that his head is between the wedges and that makes me feel uncomfortable. He also is starting to wiggle around alot more and some times he wiggles his little head right off the top of the inclined to sleep bottom. This props his head back and seems very uncomfortable and unsafe. I use the side wedges attached to the sheets now but not the bottom of the sleeper. It worked good when he was days old but now he is 5 weeks and I can no longer feel safe using this product.
1,Baby Slides down BETWEEN Bumpers....dangerous,My 3 month old slid down between the bumpers the first night I used it...I almost had a heart attack when I saw her in the morning. This could be very dangerous...babies can suffocate.
1,thought it would be great,I had heard many good things about these inclined sleepers but when I came in to check on my 1 month old he had squirmed down with his face stuck against the barrier. If I had not gone in to check he might have suffocated on his own carbon dioxide. I suggest rolling a receiving blanket tightly and putting under one side of the baby instead. It might save their life.
3,needs improvement,"When I first used this product, I loved it. After about a week and a second washing, I noticed the material looked as if I had it for years, the foam began to break down and the velcro lost is ability to hold. I found my newborn with scratches on his legs, where the velcro was supposed to be attached to the incline. In addition, he began to slide down and get bunched between the bolsters. The idea of this product is great, the quality on the other hand needs improvement."
3,Impossible to clean!,"I bought this because my son had horrible reflux and I was told he would improve if sleeping on an incline. While this helped a little, he did spit up on it and it was impossible to get clean. The cover removes, so that can easily be machine-washed, but the incline pad is foam. How are you supposed to clean the foam? As a result, I had to throw it out after only a few uses. It just was too dirty for me to want to use anymore."
1,Our baby hated it!,"he wouldn't stop crying when we put him down on the inclined to sleep, so we picked him up, removed the item from the bassinet and put him back down -- he was fast asleep in less than 5 seconds!!"
5,Happy 2nd Time Mom,"I received the Incline to Sleep as a shower gift and almost returned it after reading some of the other reviews. I'm glad I didn't. My baby is now 6 weeks old and I have never found her sliding down the incline, as some of the other reviewers wrote. The side positioners also stay in place without any problems."
2,Waste of money,"Not that it cost very much, but a waste nonetheless. I purchased this to help my son avoid a flat head, but only ended up using it for about a week.Since he is a March baby and we live in Michigan, the nights are cold so he would wear thicker sleeper pajamas to bed. The velcro sides that hold your baby in place would stick to his pj's, he would slide down between the two sides and some nights would end up sliding right off of it anyway since he moved his arms while he slept. I was more afraid he'd have his face stuffed into the side and would suffocate more than I worried about getting a flat head.One night he wet through his diaper so I washed it and I could not straighten out the cushion enough inside to fit nicely back into the cover.I will not be purchasing one of these for any future children I may have."
2,nothing special,"This product needs to be covered with a blanket, the mesh at the head seemed to irritate my baby, she slept better once i put a blanket on it. I also had to remove one side panel, it was too tight of a fit for her, she likes to roll to her side a little and could barely even turn her head. I know it keeps them on their back, but I would not buy it again."
2,Not good for active baby,"When my daughter was a few days old I went into her room because she was crying... I found that she had gotten out of her swaddling, slid down, and turned. Her face was smashed against the side of the side positioners and she was having a hard time breathing. Took this product out immediately. A couple weeks later I decided to give it another try. It happened again. I would not recommend this for an active baby that likes to move at a young age."
1,Dissapointed and Disgusted!,I bought this item for my daughter and I thought I loved it...This product gets dirty very easily. I ended up throwing it away because the foam peice got MOLDY! I was disgusted...my daughter could have gotten sick from that. We probably had this item for about 3 months and I washed it atleast once a week. I don't recomend this product.
3,"Good idea, but sometimes not practical.","I got this for my son and used it from birth. I found that it did help him sleep more soundly as his movements during sleep did not jerk him awake as easily. However, after a few weeks, when he had a restless sleep, he would end up sliding down so that his head was between the bolsters. I do not think this would be a problem, but it did make me uncomfortable to see this and I don't use it often. This happened even as a newborn, just two weeks old. I did hold on to this to use when he has a cold to keep him elevated, but I could just as easily slipped a pillow under his mattress and not spent the money. I am sure this works great for some kids, but I didn't get much use out of it."
2,Great for newborns/not for babies older than 1 month,"I bought this item when my daugther was first born and it worked great. Once she hit a month old and was moving around more, her head would slide off of the side even with the positioners in tact. I got pretty scared. Once they start to move more, I would probably recommend getting the wedge incline for the crib, or just purchase that in the beginning. It is much cheaper and you will feel more safe and secure when your baby is inclined."
4,Great Product!!!,"Our son has reflux so we like to keep him on an incline when he sleeps. He is 2 months old and still uses this product. My only complaint is that the incline could be a little steeper. I also like this product b/c I often place him to sleep on his side and the ""bumpers"" hold him nice and secure. I know..I know..BACK TO SLEEP but when your child has Reflux you will do what it takes to ease his pain! But the bumpers give me peace-of-mind that he will not roll over."
1,Used for 2 weeks,"Don't bother buying this ""pillow!"" I used with our son for no more than 2 weeks! After about 10 days he had figured out how to scoot down so his face was where his body should be. This made me nervous because of fear of SIDS with those pillow things. A few days later he started scooting himself up the pillow so his head was off the top. Totally useless! Also, the cover shrunk dramatically when I washed it before using it."
3,Helps for some things but not others,"My infant has problems with reflux and this positioner doesn't provide enough of an incline to help with that. However, the plus side to it is that before the reflux problems started, when we first brought him home, this positioner made him feel comfy in a big crib. Also helped him feel comfortable sleeping in other places (i.e. his bassinet) because we could just move the positioner to the bassinet and it was familiar to him. Downside is that he slides down it, we find he's slid all the way down with his head at the bottom of it and the rest of him completely off it each time he wakes to eat. It is machine washable, which is nice, though needs extra drying time in the dryer."
4,Great Product for Early Month until Baby Becomes Active in Crib,"I used this product almost from day one and loved it. The slight incline is great for minor acid reflux, especially after those late night/early morning feedings when your baby goes from eating to sleeping. Once my son became more active, this product's benefits were greatly reduced because he would slip down and move around the crib. If you have an active baby, I would still buy this by plan on removing it from the crib once the baby is 3-4 months."
2,"Can be helpful, but be careful","My child had issues with reflux so I bought this to help him digest while sleeping. Two problems: 1. He was once napping in the middle of his crib on this and his head when over the edge as he must have scooted upward. (from then on I made sure to place the head side against the bumper) 2. After he was a few weeks old he would squirm down it and I was uncomfortable with his head being between the cushions. I have since found it easier to place a pillow under the crib mattress to raise the head side up a little. A regular bed pillow works good as it is the same length as the width of the crib mattress. His head is now elevated and if he moves around there are no obstructions. He is also still sleeping on a firm surface, which is safer."
1,Not worth it,"We had this for our son. He would constantly slip down and then his pajamas were up around his face which is certainly not safe. We stopped using it after about a week, so it certainly was not worth the money."
1,Careful! Baby can work his way off the wedge!,"I work with a lot of newborns in private homes, and have used this positioner quite a few times. I now refuse to work with it. I have seen many babies work their way UP the wedge, and then their head falls off the top of it. This seems very dangerous (if not uncomforatble) to me! If you want a wedge because of tummy troubles, reflux, etc. get a wedge that goes under the mattress or under the sheet, or better yet, just put a thick pillow under the mattress."
1,Do not buy,My newborn could not stay positioned properly on this. He slid down and ended up with his head between the 2 bolsters - a potentially dangerous position. I do not recommend this product.
1,Not Safe!,"I do not own one of these, however according to studies done by scientists, sleep positioners for babies are not known to be any safer for keeping babies on their back and can even sometimes increase the risk for SIDS. Please consider researching sleep positioners before buying one!!!"
1,Scratched my baby!,We were excited to use this product and it worked well until my baby scratched her leg. The velcro underneath the side attachments scratched my baby's leg as she was kicking when she woke up from her nap. I was VERY upset to see that a product made for babies could do this.
4,Good Product,My son was born 7 weeks premature and is just under 5 pounds. This product allows him to be positioned on his side snuggly while swaddled. It provides him the security he likes and we need. We even put a changing pad over it when we change his diaper since he feels rather insecure with nothing around him as we are changing him. It is used in our upstairs and downstairs bassinets. I will be buying one more so we don't have to bring the upstairs one downstairs everyday. Highly recommended.
3,Problems with this product,"I loved this sleep positioner for the first week after my daughter was born. It held her in one position and kept her head from becoming flat. However, sometimes her head would fall off one side of the wedge, leaving her body on the wedge. Also, when she was about two weeks old, she started sliding down the wedge, leaving her head between the two velcro pads. This made me really nervous!She is now nine weeks old, and I have found her completely off of the wedge and laying the opposite way in her crib. I think she's outgrown it already! I wish this wedge had some sort of foot rest where it would keep her from sliding down. I really liked the idea of this product!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This was one of the worst mistakes I have made so far in being a new parent. I TRIED to let my baby sleep on this thinking that it was a safe bet. Unfortunately, my baby moves in his sleep (as most babies do I would imagine) and when I checked on him, he had slid down the wedge and his arms were up over his head. I moved him up the wedge again and moved the sides down lower on the wedge (thinking this would help somehow...) When I checked him again, his head was hanging over the side of the wedge. At that point, I removed the wedge completely and will never try it again. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone!!!!"
3,Need one to fit the whole bed,This is great I wish I would have had it for my granddauhgter 7 yrs ago
4,also good for tandem bottle feeding newborn twins,"I bought two of these in anticipation of the birth of our twin girls. I thought we might use them for sleeping in their shared crib. However, we ended up putting one of the larger crib-width foam wedges in the crib, and are instead using these ""Inclined to Sleep"" wedges for nighttime bottle feedings. I know there aren't many folks out there who need to feed two newborn babies bottles at the same time, but if you happen to be one of them, I'd highly recommend this product. It keeps the girls in place, with their heads slightly elevated while drinking. I've set them up on a twin matress on the floor of the nursery, and I drape a baby blanket on top of each wedge before putting a baby on it (to catch the inevitable spit up or bottle spills). This system works wonderfully for me, and in fact, I'm thinking about buying another pair for the living room to set up a second ""feeding station"" there for daytime feedings."
2,This product did not work for my son!,"When we first brought my 6 week premature son home from the hospital at 1 week old, we tried this product. He wiggled around too much to stay in it. He also would not stay swaddled. I found him completely off it at the opposite end of the crib, when we used this. At that point, it became too dangerous to use because it could smother him if it flipped on top of him. I tried to use it one more time when he seemed congested, but he screamed when I put him down on it & immediately tried to wiggle himself off of it. Don't waste your money on a product that can oly be used for the first couple of weeks on a child that doesn't move around a lot!"
2,waste of $,"i registered and received this item, but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest, but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me, and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over, and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one, which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib. this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom, but a waste"
2,Baby slides down,The side positioners helped however our baby would slide down and wind up in a most uncomfortable position in the bassinet...
1,Don't waste your money,"When I saw that this was both a crib wedge and sleep positioner all in one, I was happy. I figured I would save money since I was planning on buying both things anyway for my son. Well, from the very beginning, he would slide down and end up off of the product. He did this every night. Finally, by the time he was two months it was in his closet. Obviously, since he was able to scoot himself down, the positioner did not keep him in place. This positioner is definitely not worth the money. You are better off just buying a plain crib wedge to help your baby's breathing rather than this two-in-one disaster."
3,Not enough incline and too soft,"I bought this sleep positioner because I read the other reviews saying it helped with reflux. My baby still spits up and chokes even when using this. It doesn't have enough incline and the bottom cushion is too soft. Once the weight of the baby is in it, it becomes flattened out and doesn't serve the purpose anylonger. It is also very short so the baby's legs are dangling off the end. I like it to take with me on trips to lay her on while changing her diaper but not for her to sleep on. I found the Amby Hammock much better for her reflux."
4,Great Product- worth every cent,My daughter is still using this product at 4 Months and started at 3 weeks old. It really helped transition her from my bed to the cradle. Roll up a blanket and put it under your baby's legs to help with sliding and to make it even more comfortable. We love it! Also helps with her relfux problems.
4,Great for co-sleeping,"We're sleeping with our baby and use this to position her between us at night. It works great because it elevates her just up to eye level, and it's soft enough that I can still snuggle up to her. I position the wedges nice and tight to her sides, so it gives us peace of mind knowing that she's sleeping in the right position. I know I may not be able to use it when she gets a bit older because she'll probably scoot down on it, but for now, it works great for us. And, for the price I feel it's worth it."
1,Can be dangerous,"I used this product for the first 2-3 weeks, when I was able to swaddle my infant and he didn't move around in his sleep much. Once he started to move, however, he would slide down the incline and his face would end up against the positioners - very dangerous! I ended up buying a positioner that does not incline, however it does have ""open"" positioners (like an air vent), so if baby does end up scooched down, he/she can still easily breathe. I would not recommend this product."
1,Son got too smart for it,"I bought this for my son to try and get him to sleep properly but he ended up finding ways to escape it. I tried this on him for three days but I would get up to find him slid out of it, giving me his mischievious grin. Luckily I was able to return it and get back the money I wasted. I think it's useless. Babies are too smart for this. They will find ways out of it."
1,Dangerous sliding down into bolsters could cause suffocation,"I loved the idea. . . . My seven week old baby needs help digesting BUT I was horrified to hear her fussing and then to see her slumped down the inlince turned slightly to the side with her face smashed up against the bolster. Frankly, it is not worth it. I am more afraid that this could harm/kill my baby than if she were to throw up. Thank God I was in the room. I cannot imagine what would have happened if I was not."
1,Check with your doctor!,CAUTION!!! I thought this would help my newborn sleep better and reduce the risk of SIDS. I was talking to the hospital after my son was born and the nurse told me to IMMEDIATELY discontinuing this product as it dramatically increases the risk of SIDS. I am furious that the manufacturer continues to make this product and does not put a warning label on it regarding the increased risk of SIDS. My hospital is trying to get the manufacturers to pull these sleep positioners off the shelves. Make sure you talk with your doctor before using this product!
1,"Bought and returned, before the baby came","We bought this item and everything looked fine. Then we attended a Baby CPR and Safety Class at our local hospital and learned that this product might be preventing SIDS, but itself constitutes a suffocation hazard!Even the American SIDS Institute says on their website (sids.org):""Place infants to sleep in a baby bed with a firm mattress. There should be nothing in the bed but the baby - no covering, no pillows, no bumper pads and no toys. Soft mattresses and heavy covering are associated with the risk for SIDS.""Please think, before you buy. Thank you!"
2,He slides down every night,"I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it.Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son."
3,Worked for a few weeks,"We used this with our newborn and it worked fine the first few weeks. Then as my little guy moved around more, I would find him at the bottom and in between the bumpers,no matter how snug I put the bumpers beside him. Also, he would wake up sweating everytime. It's a pain to wash because when you try to put the foam back in the case, it never fit properly and so you ended up with this bulky foam and you pretty much had to flatten it to make the foam fit...it takes me more than 5 minutes just to get the whole foam inside the case. I stopped using it by the time our baby was one month."
3,It's okay... if your baby doesn't move in his sleep,"Since birth, our son did a lot of squirming in his sleep. We tightly bundled him and placed him on the incline to sleep. Despite many attempts, after about two hours, he was at the bottom of the wedge.We dedided to give the wedge another try when we stopped bundling him (hoping that his free arms would keep him lodged at the top of the wedge). Still no luck, a few hours later, I'd check on him and his arms would be above his head and he'd be at the bottom of the wedge again.I still use the wedge during supervised naps to prop him on his side. This position seems to work well."
2,Safety problem,I did not like this sleep positioner! My daughter would wiggle out the top of it in her sleep. I found her with her head hanging off the top of it! I threw it away that very day. We switched to one that was not inclined and now even if she wiggles out it won't hurt her breathing or her neck. The only good thing about it is the velcro on the bolsters sticks better than most.
2,Not a safe product,"I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower. I thought it would be wonderful. I was wrong. My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner. In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides. SCARY! This started happening after about 3 weeks of age. Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part. I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow. Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone. It's not worth the risk."
1,Dangerous. Head hanging off the back. Useful for breasfeeding!,My 3 weeks old baby ends up with her head hanging off the back of this pillow or would slide down with her face in between the 2 positioners. It is dangerous.I found a use for the positioners:I use them while breastfeeding in bed on my side to hold my breast up to my baby's mouth!
2,OK for the first month...,"We bought this product for our newborn and initially loved it. It kept him safely on his back and we had peace of mind. Then he started to move a little more in his sleep and we found him scootched all the way down to the bottom with his face in the cushions. The last time we used it was when we found him with his head hanging off the incline and he was crying. We then went to the flat positioner instead and seemed to eliminate this problem. If this product is purchased, I would also cover it with a receiving blanket to cover the mesh pad, it does seem to be a little rough on baby's head without it."
2,Didn't really use it,"We used this during my baby's first few days home, and haven't used it since. It seems like he would slide down, even with the foam sides in place. Now that my baby is 3 weeks old, he likes to sleep with his arms above his head and the foam sides seemed to block him from getting into that comfortable position."
3,Flimsy,"DD sinks right into the foam and she's only 2 1/2 weeks old! I'm not using this anymore as of today, it's just way too cheaply made. I'm actually afraid she'll smother in it, because it's so soft and cushy."
2,Dangerous for Babies,"I do not recomend this product. My baby boy keep sliding down and end up several times with the support that are supose to go under his arms, right on his face. This is a sofocation hazard."
5,Love it,"I admit I am a nervous first time father.After reading about SIDs, choking, reflux and all the other horrible things that happen to babies I thought I MUST have this.We never regretted the purchase. Our daughter used this for a couple months and we never had the problem of her sliding down like some other reviewers. The same position we put her to sleep is how we found her in when we got up.Easy to wash and keep clean but the inner foam does tend to get ""yellowed"" a bit too quickly. I won't want to use this same unit for another child and would buy a new one if I had another baby."
4,good sense of security,"My husband and I loved using this product. We placed our baby on the inclined to sleep and put him right in the middle of our bed. It made us feel secure that our newborn would not roll over and suffocate himself. Our baby used it for about 3 months and after that, he's always loved sleeping on his back."
1,Dangerous,"I liked the idea of the incline in a positioner, but it turned out to be rather dangerous for my baby. I made sure the sides were firm against his body to position him, but he still slipped so that his face ended up against the foam sides. We're lucky he's still in a bassinet in our bedroom, or we wouldn't have heard the muffled cries. HORRIBLE!"
2,Sleepless nights.,"For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work."
2,Didn't work for us...,"Our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges wouldn't stay in place. I love the idea, but it just didn't work for us."
2,Baby Slides!,"My three month old outgrew her positioner that came with her co-sleeper recently and I thought that this would be a logical replacement. I even thought the ""tempurpedic"" type pad would prove beneficial. Not in the least! Each morning she wakes up having slid down to the bottom of her bassinet. Thankfully we swaddle her and/or put her in a sleep sack so blankets aren't an issue. This particular item is only great in theory. I have used other posirioners in the past that never had this problem."
2,Worked fine for a couple of weeks,"This was a perfect design for our baby when he was a couple of weeks old, but then, as he began to fidget and wiggle, he slid right off of the wedge."
4,Great Product!,"For whatever reason, since the day we got home my 2.5 week old will only fall asleep in our bed. It has been a great test to try and get her from our bed to her bassinet with out waking her and without us falling asleep! I purchased this product yesterday and used it for the first time last night...not only could I go to sleep with ease knowing that she wasn't going to roll under me, but she slept from 1 a.m. to 8:15!!! The only complaints I have is that the velcro positioners do come unattached a little too easy...but otherwise, Great product!"
2,"Functionally, not a great design.","I purchased the 'rest assured' sleep postioner for one of our twins girls & was given this 'inclined to sleep' from a friend, so decided to use that for our other twin girl. I have to say I do not like the inclined to sleep at all.When I place my daughter on it she manages to slip down the angled pillow, so when I go in to check on her she is scrunched up at the bottom of it. Kind of acts like a slide. Also if the baby spits up & you have to wash it, then it takes a long time to dry the foam insert.Our other twin daughter has been using the 'rest assured' sleep positioner & I love it, so I just went out today & purchased a second one so they can both have a safe good nights sleep."
2,two towels can do the same thing and cost less than 20 bucks,I thought that I would need this for my first child so I added it to my registry.I got it and only to used it occasionally for the first two or three weeks. I found that my son didn't care to sleep in it and I felt guilt about someone spending the money on it.
3,first time mom,"Overall I think it is a good product. I don't worry about my newborn baby being in the wrong position at night now, I swaddle her and place her in the Inclined to Sleep and she does just fine. I also have used it in bed with my husband and myself, since she sleeps better with us, and I don't worry about the safety issues of cosleeping.HOWEVER, the foam is way too soft and the fabric is cheap. My daughter is only 2 weeks old and the product looks like it has been used for years. I now have to place a folded receiving blanket under the head portion to get the same incline as it was when it was new. Plus she is a long baby, and does tend to wriggle down to the bottom at times, it would be useful if the Inclined to Sleep were longer and had a bottom wedge to prevent sliding down. I usually solve this by having a light blanket over her legs and tucking it in the sides and bottom, and then jamming the bottom of the Inclined to Sleep against the bottom of the bassinet."
2,She slides right out!,"I bought this for my acid reflux baby, but no matter how we positioned the wedges, she would slide out, roll over (at only a few weeks), or worse, end up slid down on her side with her face smashed in the positioners on the side! Also, all the respositioning wore out the Velcro in a few weeks, so the positioners slid around a bit. Maybe with a calm baby this would work, but for our wiggly girl we're switching to a different version of the SnuggleNest."
1,Waste of money,A friend recommended this product because it helped his baby sleep at night. It never worked for our daughter. She slips right off of it and ends up in a puddle at the bottom. I've arranged the foam positioners as tight as possible around her little body and even taken her arms out of the swaddle and put the positioners beneath her armpits - she still slides down. Save your money and use two rolled up receiving blankets like they do in the hospital.
1,For Acid Reflex and Colic Baby's,My Husband and I got this for our Acid Reflex Baby and it did NOT help. When we put her on it she would slide right off. The material is not that soft. It also did not keep her from rolling over. I would NOT recommend it. If you have a Acid Reflex Baby go to www.colicshop.com this site can help with that and Colic Baby's as well. Hope this help's!
2,Plan on using for a REAL SHORT time,"This was fine for the first couple weeks, then I realized that it actually didn't do much help. Sometimes it would slide up or down and just wasn't long enough for him (and my guy is a short guy!). I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him. Worked perfect!"
5,Great,For the money it's great we have used it everywhere as a portable bed for our newborn 8lbs 7 oz and when we put him on a couch to sleep he sleeps in this while we eat!we thought are queen size bed was big enougth but really it's a bit small for 3 of us I am 6ft se we got a co sleeper and we put him in this in the co-sleeper afet 4-6 months he will move onto crib.
2,COULD DO WITHOUT,"My friends who are parents suggested that I register for this item. It worked for 1 week, after I threw it across the room because my daughter wouldn't sleep in it, it's now in the closet. I'm sure this works well for some babies, but you should put it in the bassinet so they'll get use to it. That is if it'll fit in your bassinet."
1,Not for Squirmy Babies...,"In theory, I thought that this was a good buy since it would keep the baby on her back when sleeping. I tried this the first night my daughter slept in her bassinet. I had her feet positioned at the bottom and moved the side support wedges so that they were around her waist. A few hours later, she was wailing uncontrollably; when I went in to check on her, she had wiggled up so far that her head was over the top wedge therefore painfully extending her neck. I removed this from her bassinet immediately and will not use it again."
2,1st Time Mom,"I am so surprised that this product received rave reviews. The wedge is much too soft, it offered no incline or support for my 6.5lb son. I washed the cover once, and it pilled instantly and never fit over the foam right, so I tossed the wedge part. I gave the product 2 stars because I've been using the triangular sleep positioners. While the velcro on the positioners never stuck well to the wedge, they attach quite nicely to the terrycloth sheet savers that I use. 6 months later, and I'm still using the sleep positioners."
4,Awesome!,"This game is awesome,the Slam Dunk contest gives u a good score if u use the dunk once,but if u use the dunk more than once it keeps decreasing your score.The 3-Point Contest is just overall GREAT and it's very simple and straight forward plus in the All-Star Game u can choose your own team!In other words,this game has the WHOLE All-Star weekend! The Season mode is very realalistic,u can't predict what is going to happen just by the team.The only reason y i gave this a 4 of this game is specifically the graphics i would rate 4 plus there is no commentaterand the fouls r well called EXCEPT when u try to make a block too close to a player.Otherwise it is a GREAT game!"
5,Rossini: Guglielmo Tell (William Tell),"Rossini: Guglielmo Tell (William Tell) is a recording under the direction of Riccrado Muti who leads the Orchestra e Caro del Teatro ala Scala di Milano on this Philips Classics Productions from 1989. The booklet is massive and contains 300 pages. It contains 3 short essays and a synopsis which is quite alot but also very ambitious. The lyrics are available in English, French, German and Italian. The sound quality is impeccable and one verily feels as if one was sitting live listening to this amazing performance. Highly recommended. 5/5."
3,What an awful production to a great concert...,"I can't believe the horrible sound of this recording. It sounds as if somebody from the audience recorded it with a cell phone, sitting at the end of the theater. A 1990 cell phone.... Good music ruined by a terrible production...."
2,"Its thin plastic key holder would break too easily, in my opinion.","Nice idea but expensive for the product, not recommended.Its plastic half-ring key-holder looks far too weak. I wouldn't expect it to survive the occasional rough-handling that goes with grabbing & turning keys.""Ultra Blast""...?... must be the acoustical design as the electronics only seem to be the flashlight.Also this appears to be a discontinued product that has been sitting on the back shelves for a decade."
5,Holecaust researchers should have this book,"More than two milliion poeple died in Auschwitz, 80% of them Jewish.Principal sections in this book addres the history of this camp,theperpetrators,the inmates,escapes and even underground resistance.An excelend one-volume on the history of Auchwitz."
5,Uplifting and soothing music,"""David Hansen's ethereal journey ""All That I Could Give"" is a wondrous trip through the landscape of this talented musician's mind. Backed by a crisp and clean production, the journey is all at once playful and purposeful.""Jim Ellis"
2,not what i expected,"when i got the game, i expected a kinda cool custom car game. but all it is a bunch of mini-games that never change and very bad car controlls...when you have to make money in the first half, you play mini-games that involve ""ghostriding"". VERY BAD. Driving controlls are terible. and you always seem to crashed in a lightpost every 5 seconds.The pimping process is kinda cool. but you only have 2 min. to pimp out sombody's car. and your going againts a rival pimper. but some of the car add-ons are coolBottom line: not that great, but fun pimping process. PS: there are only 2 mini-games that go on through out the whole game"
5,My Favorite Frangrance,"Hello All,I just thought I would share with you all how great this scent is.*It can be worn day time and at night*Definitely a fragrance that will hypnotize your significant other*Comes in a beautiful container (I'm sure a big chunk of what you spend on this item is paying for the bottle)*A little goes a long way"
1,Had to reformat computer,"I installed this software, and immediately I was unable to use Outlook, see most websites, or use Yahoo email. I was unable to uninstall it.I took my computer to my tech support guru, and he was unable to uninstall the CA Security, so in the end, after three days of screwing aroud with it, he had to completely reinstall Windows, and reload all of my other software.I didn't like CA Security Suite."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I bought this internet security suite because of the attractive price, features, and reviews, but when I installed it on my new Dell Inspiron 531, it slowed everything on my machine to an unbearable crawl. Since nothing seemed to alleviate the problem, I followed the instructions to uninstall it. When I booted up afterwards, my machine was still painfully slow. Putting the computer in safe mode, I discovered that the CA program files were still loaded and could not be deleted. After many hours of frustration, I finally managed to contact tech support online, and someone in India took control of my computer and finally was able to get the software totally off my machine. Right after that, my speed was back to normal. Given the frustration and time wasted on this software, I would never recommend it to anyone."
1,Just worthless,I just bought a new dell desktop with Vista and it is conflicting with explorer 7.0 which comes with windows Vista. It is nothing but a problem.I finally had to get the security software from Verizon DSL and completely deleted this one from my new computer.
1,Not impressed,"Bought the boost gauge to troubleshoot a diesel engine. Only need to know if the boost before the intercooler was close to the boost after it. When I unpacked it, the gauge read seven psi without being hooked up. This is quite a bit on a sixty pound gauge. Sent a coupe of e mails to the manufacturer wanting to know if the needle could be repositioned or how to repair the gauge. No response. Since it will work for what I wanted, I'll use it rather than going to the hassle of returning it for a different one. I wouldn't buy another from the same manufacturer since the quality control is obviously lax and response to the customer seems to fall in the same category."
2,Everything great except the sequencing,"I loved the way this was filmed, the music, the actors/yogis, the instructor, but the actual sequencing was just way too repetitive. For the 50 minutes you devote to the DVD so much more could have been done in terms of different kinds of poses. I eventually just kept the DVD playing because I liked the sound of it and did my own yoga poses. It's pretty much just a flow in and out of childs poses to downward dog with a couple of standing poses thrown in. The intro section did feel good however, as it had a nice dance like stretch to it. Overall, I don't recommend it to anyone other than serious beginners who want the same repetition throughout."
3,Okay but not great,"This workout is challenging and partially fun because you are asked to do more advanced moves that don't require a lot of yoga background. From this, you will be able to burn fat and slim your body. The problem is with the instructor, she is not very good at giving instructions. More than once, she had said ""right"" instead of ""left"" because she was supposed to mirror for us. Sometimes she is too slow and sometimes too fast. I didn't like how she was trying to do everything in 30 minutes."
2,Misleading,"I am a beginner and was in the process of trying to find a slightly more advanced yoga workout that would make me sweat. I though ""cardio"" yoga would be perfect. By no means am I superfit but I was yawning all the way through the hour workout. Not only did I find it unchallenging, Moreno's constant encouragement was distracting and incredibly annoying. I don't need to be endlessly reminded to be ""grateful"" of my abilities. And I didn't even break a sweat. I will say the express workout was much more challenging and just direct instruction. Why the hour-long workout was so fundamentally different than the express is beyond me."
1,"no cardio, very slow, very basic","If you look for a cardio exercise, this is NOT it. If you have ANY experience at all with yoga exercise, you'll be bored to death by very slow, prolonged explanation. Big disappointment."
2,Buyers be aware!!!!,"This is the same dvd as "" yoga dance fusion"". I have already checked this with the Gaian site, So if you have Yoga Dance Fusion, you have this dvd, but with a different name."
3,"No cardio, but good yoga","This yoga practice is as far from cardio as you can possibly get, so I think the title of this DVD is misleading. The yoga practice actually moves very slowly through each pose and I enjoyed the practice very much. The instructor is very good and positive but she was too chatty for my taste. Some people may not be bothered by that because she is a very likeable person."
4,Outrageous CD & DVD!!!,"WOW!!! Man does this CD/DVD rock. Do yourself a favor and get the DVD if you can only afford one. The concert itself is identical on both the DVD and the CD. There are plenty of extras on the DVD, plus 6 tunes filmed in a studio with some classical musicians (strings, etc...) thrown in to make things extra nice. :)What a show. Listening the the audio only from the DVD, I now realize that the music performance here stands on its own. Tight, crisp production and a setlist that just doesn't let up.To watch the DVD is another whole new level of enjoyment. Multi-Camera shoot with top notch editing and lights to boot. Good good stuff indeed!Christmas came a little early this year. Woo Hooooooooooo :)"
5,UFO Showtime is a Great Time!,UFO'S LASTEST ALBUM YOU ARE HERE IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMSOF THE LAST YEAR AND ONE OF UFO'S BEST ALBUMS. IF YOU LIKEDWILD WILLING AND INNOCENT YOU LOVE THIS! THE DVD SHOWTIME ISFROM THAT TOUR AND SHOW UFO IS STILL A FORCE AND A HELL OF ABAND. I THINK VINNIE MOORE PROVES WITH HIS SCHENKER STYLE OFPLAYING HE WAS THE PERFECT MAN FOR THE JOB. JASON BONHAM PLAYSVERY MUCH LIKE ANDY PARKER AND DOES A GREAT JOB ALSO. THE DVDHAS NEW SONGS AND OLD CLASSICS AND PLAY THEM AS GOOD AS EVER!I WOULD'VE LIKE TO SEE NO PLACE TO RUN ADDED! ANYWAY THE EXTRASARE GREAT AND THE STUDIO SONGS ARE AWESOME! SONGS LIKE TRY MEAND PROFESSION OF VIOLENCE ARE JUST A DREAM COME TRUE! SO GETTHIS DVD AND THE CD AND ENJOY UFO BECAUSE THEY ARE BACK!!!!!!
3,Please come back Mr. Schenker,"The overall sound is a little muddy. I agree with the reviewers that say Vinnie Moore is not right for this band. It's obvious that he cannot play Schenker's solos and he is covered by the rest of the band on more than one occasion. This would have been a much better band and album if John Norum had stayed with them. His style is along the same European hard rock line as Schenker's, wheras Moore is one of those Shrapnel shredders who never left the 80's.Compare the versions of the classic UFO songs on this album to those on Strangers in the Night (or even Werevolves of London) and it's easy to see their best days are behind them.Phil Mogg's voice is not up to par, Jason Bonham thinks he's playing Moby Dick in every song....it's just a mess and not a worthy album of such a legendary band.Get Schenker back or ""Pack It Up and Go!"""
3,Not the band's fault,"I have been a UFO fan for 25 years and I was disappointed in this cd to the point that I am selling it. I feel that Vinnie's style truely does not fit into UFO, he is good but he is a neo-classical guy not a true rock guy. The worst thing about the cd is that the guitar is pushed way back into the mix and the vocals are too up front. I expected more from Tommy Newton. The mix just kills some of the solos."
3,"If I never heard ""Strangers...""","If I never heard Strangers in the Night, I would have probabably enjoyed this CD more. I'm not a great fan of ""shred"" guitar, especially with Carlos Santana tone (I like Carlos, and the tone suits him fine). Don't misunderstand me, Vinnie Moore is a fine guitarist, I'm just not a fan of all that tapping. Technically it is sound, but I hear no feeling in it. As I said, if I'd never heard ""Strangers in the Night, I'd most likely be satisfied with this CD, but there is only one Michael Schenker, and he is definitely not on this CD! The least they could have done would be to omit ""Rock Bottom"", as I'm not sure even Michael himself could duplicate,replicate or imitate his almost possessed sounding lead in that song. Overall good CD, just not as good as with Michael. If You don't have ""Strangers in the Night"", buy it instead of this one."
4,"UFO ""Showtime"" will NOT disappoint !!!!!","I would have given this one a 4 and a half. Buy it ! as well as the DVD !! I realllly dig ""Mr Freeze"", I used to be one of the UFO fans that only had the classics - I was very pleasantly surprised when i heard this for the first time. It is now in my regular rotation. UFO is not going anywhere! neither are the Scorpions...check out ""Unbreakable"" if you ""Don't Believe a Word""I challenge you to buy this one. I would not be wasting my timeright now if I didn't think that this was a very worthy disc and or DVD to have in our collections !"
3,"It's no ""Strangers""...","but it's not supposed to be. Vinnie Moore pulls off the new songs (from You Are Here) very well, but that's about it. Disc 2 is mostly their classic stuff from Strangers, which isn't bad, but I wouldn't have minded hearing stuff from their lost years with Chapman or more stuff from Sharks, Walk on Water, even Mechanix. The sound quality is good, but you can tell they're playing in a very small venue, which makes me feel sad for them-especially since I saw them in a small place myself. Maybe they should try to open for Aerosmith, Metallica, or Bon Jovi. Mogg's voice is on target on this disc, but Moore doesn't seem to be a good fit."
1,Don't buy this,"Obviously, I completely agree with the 'Too small' approach, but I thought I'd add this. This is an extract from an email from Tetra RE this product.'We suggest that people keep the goldfish in an aquarium. We also suggest that people have 3 gallons of water per 1 inch of goldfish. Eventually the customer will have to move the goldfish to a larger tank. It also recommended the customer do a 50% water change once a week to keep thewater healthy for the fish. Water testing is a routine part of the care of the fish.'So, as you can well see, even they admit it is far too small."
5,Great thinking!,Christopher's way of thinking up twisting ends amazes me! I love mystreys where the least expected is the one who did the crime but this is equally good. Watch really came through this time and to think he outsmarted the internet! The book was very stretchy about the part in the house. It seemed to go on forever even though it was just a week. I knew Savannah Stranger had something to do with it because she seemed anxious to get away and I don't think she was going just because of her brother! I give thy 2 words: BUY IT!
4,Handy,"I've used this set four times now. It does provide a lot of useful, pretty designs in one kit, which I like. The designs could be a little more clear - you have to press pretty hard to get a good impression in regular icing. Shows up pretty good in fondant. If using with regular icing make sure you have a good ""crust"" or that your icing is dry before you press, as icing that is still a little moist will easily get trapped in the corners of the press and it's hard to get out."
4,Great for starters!,This is such a great tool for beginners. It's easy to use and gives a very professional look to your cakes. Can be used to imprint icing that can then be traced in another color. Works great on fondant as well!
5,Creates a nice look easily,I have used these on a couple different cakes and they work really well. It is easy to pipe above the pattern and it looks like it was done free hand!
5,A must have,Keeps my newborn son in position I put him. It makes me feel good that my son will not have square head because he always sleeps on one side.
4,Overall Good Product,This is a fairly good product. Serves it's purpose. Easy to wash. My 6 week old likes it and that's all that matters.
5,Feel better,"This is a great thing to have. I've used it right from the beginning. She is a squirmy baby and it helps keep her in one spot and gives me a piece of mind during the night. Also, because the sides are velcro, I can reposition them to make them wider as she grows and put her on her side for daytime naps. Easy to clean as well, goes right into the washing machine."
2,Moves with the baby,"I bought two sleep positioners, one for my daughter's crib and one for her pack 'n play. This one is okay, but my daughter manages to squirm in it a lot more than she does her ""inclined to sleep"" positioner. The inclined positioner has foam inside and stays put!"
3,"Okay, but there are better...","This product is okay. I dont like the material used on the back of it as it is so slippery.I found a nicer one at Target made with a head support of memory foam. My daughter LUVS it and sleeps really well on it. I would recommend looking at the one at target first, although this one does do the job."
5,Couldn't nap without it!!,"We love this item. As a new parent, you're constantly trudging back and forth into the nursery to check whether your baby's sleeping ok. After a few hundred return trips, we realized that the Rest Assured kept our baby from rolling onto her tummy and kept her reasonably comfortable.The peace of mind is well worth it.P.S. Our pediatrician told us to keep the baby's mattress propped up to prevent colic and the slick bottom of the Rest Assured can occasionally make for a ""baby slolem."" We had to buy some non-skid matting to put underneath to keep the baby from her nightly ski. Just something to keep it in mind."
3,"Great, depending on how big your baby is","I loved having this for the first three weeks but by then my baby was already squirming out of it. and if your baby pees through their outfit, this is not water proof. So you have to throw the entire thing into the washing machine and wait until the foam insert air-dries by itself. They really need to add a waterproof protection to this item. Once I had washed it a couple of times, it had lost it's shape and looked 2 years old. We threw it out after just a few weeks. But, that said, I did love it for the first couple weeks when baby was super small and in the co sleeper next to me. I just peeked over and he was right where I'd put him."
1,I don't recommend,"I am an RN in the healthcare industry and have attended many child preparation classes including baby care and baby saftey in preparation for my daughter. Not one time was I ever informed in either of these classes to let my child be positioned for sleep on her side to help in the prevention of SIDS as is suggested by some of the reviewers for this item. I was taught to put my child down ALWAYS ON HER BACK with nothing else in her crib, bassinett, etc. The manufacturer of this product also states this in their description of what the product is for. You want your baby to be able to turn over by him/her self as part of natural development. This is the point when they could be safely tucked in with maybe a blanket. Please check with your pediatrician for the safest position for your baby to sleep in. I am positive he/she will tell you on the back, until they can turn themselves over. Good luck!"
2,Right Theory Just Not Needed,We used this once.. It was just not needed... roll some receiving blankets and viola... I would not spend the money on this again.
1,PLease check with your doctor,"The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib, including any of these sleep positioners or wedges, because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars. The truth is that you will probably not need it. Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way. I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it. He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again, but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary!! My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this."
2,Not really very useful,"This is a great concept, but... My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two. He would be half out of the top after an hour or so. It just didn't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway, it may actually be dangerous.Also, (he was a June baby) the polyester type material made him very sweaty, which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings. I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product."
2,Better in theory than in practice,"I registered for this sleep positioner and got it at my shower! As soon as I brought my son home from the hospital I was using it to ensure that he was sleeping safely! However, within a day or two he figured out how to slide himself down the mat so he ended up with his butt at the very bottom and often with his head between the two side pieces which terrified me! He was 8 lbs at birth and I never felt that I could get the sides tight enough to actually hold him secure. Now my son is suffering from acid reflux and I need to keep his head elevated when he sleeps. I have given up on the side pieces all together and I use the mat alone althought he still ends up at the bottom in a crunched up position anyway. This item may be great for a nice docile baby that does not move in his/her sleep but I don't think it is workable for a baby with any tendency to move or fuss in the night!"
3,Not without it's charms,This movie is not as bad as many of my fellow reviewers have wtitten. Yes the movie suffers from wooden acting and scripting. However it does have its charms. The comedy relief while often unfunny does have its moments. The stop motion dinosaur is good and there is more shots of it than I would expect in a movie this cheap. I liked this movie and think that it was worth the $6.50 or so that I paid for a used copy on Amazon.
2,It Had Potential,"A dinosaur egg lays frozen at the bottom of Crater Lake. One day a meteor falls into the lake, heating the water, incubating the egg, and VOILA....there's a rampaging dinosaur on the loose! Plotwise it's got all the fixins for a cheap and fun monster movie. The unfortunate thing is that the fun is missing.The movie does seem to be a kind of tribute the monster movies of the 50s, but Tremors it isn't. The dinosaur itself is stop motion animation and the close up head shots are a big plaster looking thing. I certainly have no problem with these things, I love that kind of stuff. It just seems like too much screen time is devoted to these two nitwits who rent out boats. They're played for comic relief and this might have worked if they were actually funny and not simply irritating.Not much else I can really say about it. I like the effort, but the formula just didn't seem to work so well this time."
2,Warms on you.,"A group of scientists find cave-drawings of cavemen fighting a dinosaur-like creature (proof all those old movies were right after all and man did live alongside the big growling ones?). However, they barely have time to speculate before a meteor crashes into the nearby Crater Lake. Okay, so it's all pretty silly, but it's still entertaining, and at least the monster is stop-motion rather than a man in a rubber suit.4 stars."
5,Best classic RPG to date,"... one of the best one's would have to be Suikoden 2. This is the only orginal ... game i have left but sold all my other games because it is that ... good. ... . Forget the new breed of games which offers top class graphics(no offence the ... games are great), this will keep you busy for hours. I have play suikoden over and over again and still love it. A good story of friendship and war in ancient timeline. Over a hundered palyable characters and vast lands to explore with characters having rune powers such as summonings, elemental powers and more. There is to much to talk about this game, any rpg lover must get this. This is a five star game hands down."
5,Amazing Faithful to the Original.,"I really enjoyed playing Suikoden II and consider it a fine addition to my RPG collection. While neither Suikoden nor Suikoden II seem to be rated with the upper echelon of outstandingly stellar RPG, the storyline is engaging, the characters are interesting and the graphics are cool. The graphics are so good, in fact, that players of the first Suikoden will recognize some old friends just by seeing them on the screen. The goal is still to try and recruit as many characters as possible, and you will have to go on a few side quests here and there to get them all. But it's worth it to unlock the entire story. There are also some special characters you can get who are not mandatory to your quest but are fun to take into battle. I don't think you'll be disappointed with Suikoden II."
5,A great sequel to a great game!,I've played this game and it's predicesor I don't know how many times. The plot is huge---the characters are fully developed and the game play is excellent. I've laughed and cried at the actions of the characters that I met while playing this game. The graphics aren't that advanced as some of the more advertised games---but the plot and characterization more than makes up for it.
3,251.51 for a cd?,"I think Suidoken is great game, i highly reccomend all their work, but unless they plan on delivering the cd via viking boat themselves, the price is a bit too steep.I'll assume the price is a error, and this is my half-assed attempts at humor.So, once it's fixed do yourself a favor and order it."
3,What a rip off,This game isn't worth spending over $100. You can go out and buy final fantasy 7 which is much better. I wish I still had my copy of the game so I can rip off some idiot.
1,If you haven't played the first one buy it otherwise...,Great game but a complete copy of the first one(which isn't a bad thing). I wish the graphics could have been improved on a little bit being that they are carbon copy of the first one (which didn't have great graphics either) 108 character makes for a lot of fun although it happens to be the exact number of characters in the first one. Also the more characters you get the bigger you base gets (just like in the first one). This game is a good game. A 8.0 out of 10.0. This game is not anywhere close to a 10!
5,Sequel to the BEST RPG!,"If you haven't yet gotten this game, get it! I've played all kinds of games until I came across Suikoden 1. It was what got me hooked to RPG's. I got Suikoden 2 as soon as it came out and played it! It is the greatest game next to Suikoden 1.For the gamers out there who are really die-hard fans for RPG's, this is something you want to check out. You must've all heard of the Final Fantasy series, right? Well, let me tell you this: I have all the FF series from FF4 to FF8 and FF Tactics for PlayStation, and Final Fantasy can NOT hold a candle up to Suikoden's (both 1 and 2! ) storyline! Sure the graphics are great, but if you're looking for CONTENT, look no further. Suikoden 2 is what you've been searching for. (And if you haven't gotten Suikoden 1 yet, get that too.)This is a game that you do NOT want to miss!"
4,Best Non-Linear RPG - So far,"Suikoden II is by far the best non-linear RPG that I have seen for the playstations so far.I have seen Baldur's Gate and Might&Magic games for the PC and if they are anything like that on the playstation - then Suikoden II will not be the best non-linear game, but for now it is !FYI: I am really getting sick of linear adventure games such as Final Fantasy VII and VIII. It is about time a game like Suikoden 1 & II came out!"
5,EASY BUT FUN,Suikoden isan easy game to play.If you re looking for cool characters and war this is the game you want SUIKODENS main feature is the 108 characters included
4,A worthy sequel,"Just like the first Suikoden, what I like best is the variety this game offers. I don't get tired of using the same characters all the time, and although its true that with some many characters in one game, they become rather shallow. But Suikoden II try to make up for that, with sub quests and the ability to gain people's secrets, you get to know each character fairly well. Story is good, and the 2D graphics isn't bad either, make it a pretty good RPG package, pick it up when you have the chance. Overall score, 88 out of 100."
5,108 Stars.....Keep em Coming!!,"I have been playing the Suikoden series for years, ever since the first one was release I was HOOKED.Suikoden 2 is nothing like the first release, well there are 108 Characters but that is just a part of Suikoden in general so no big deal, just makes it that much more fun. The story line in this one is Amazing as for the characters I would recommend going back and playing the first. You will enjoy and appreciate this game much more.In this Suikoden sadly one of my favorite parts was always the Cook off's. This game just has so much to offer it is unreal. This game has yet to be beat in my opinion and I am an AVID gamer.I bought 4 Copies of this game when it came out, I was THAT hooked to it I did not want to take a chance on losing it or having my disc damaged. I lost all but one and still play it to this day! If you have 100+ Bucks laying around do not hesitate buy this game now!!!"
5,MUST PLAY,"Betrayal between a country and its armed forces. loytalty between two friends, cant overcome ones loyalty to his country. This is Suikoden II. One of the all time great playstation games. the story line is basic just as the first one is. but there is more to do here in the land of highlands than in the scarlet moon empire. the castle really takes form and you can have cook offs and also fish with yam koo and tai ho (yep they are back). with many characters from the first suikoden included you will have hours of fun in this game. also yuber makes another mysterious appearance in another installment. this is a must play and its worth the $100 dollars you are going to spend to get it."
5,Better than 1 or 3,"Though I haven't finished 3 yet, so far I'd have to say two is the best game of the three. Suikoden games let you play about a hundred characters, if you can get them all to join your party, and have fun little quirks like letting you build up a castle and put statues in the bathroom. There are also cooking contests...It's a good time and generally agreed upon as being one of the best RPGs ever."
4,Candles on Bay Street,"Enjoyed this show, like the interaction between the three main characters.Henry P. Lisowski"
2,Not great but it's ok,Works ok as a flashlight maybe a club .the alarm isn't that loud.the strobelightdoesn't do much either.the batteries add someweight to it. they should have made it out metallike a mag light. 2/15/10 this thing just died after6 months .good news is sportsmans guide is giving mea full refund and i don't even have to mail it back.
4,for Jack Lemmon lovers,Even without Walter Matthau Jack Lemmon gives a strong performance. He and James Garner make a good comedic duo.
4,"""Our dreams are our children.""","The story covers several years and three presidencies. First Lemmon, then Garner and now Aykroid. Vice President Ted Matthews (John Heard) is a dunce. Turns out rumors of a scandal are surfacing and the now president is having thoughts of pining the scandal on Lemmon who was president at the time. Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) the head of the opposition party wants to pin it on the present administration. Col. Paul Tanner will protect the secret at any cost. There are many more players, too numerous to mention. Seems that someone has determined that Lemmon and Garner are best dispatched.Will this happen?Can they clear their names?And not just who is behind the plot, but what is the plot?Watch out for Blinky.This movie has a sound mystery base to get us through the twists and turns with lots of ""who's behind it"" moments. However the interaction between Garner and Lemmon is so much fun that sometimes we forget the plot."
4,My Fellow Americans,"Have not actually watched it yet, thought it would be a good addition to previously movies that I purchased that were political but funny"
5,Funny,I watched this years ago and some of the lines are still my favorites. Enjoyable and non-violent. Easy watching if you are looking for entertainment without the gore.
3,Good Comedy,"James Garner, Lauren Bacall, and Jack Lemmon. Two rival politicians--Garner was former president and Lemmon is present-- are running for their lives to divulge evidence in a conspiracy. Personally, I enjoy the actors but the story was loose and dragged in cliche' in the middle. It's nice if you want a light comedy. I expect more caliber when these actors are involved. MIRROR HAS TWO FACES this is not."
4,Great fun with Lemmon and Garner,"A friend made me watch this. Now I owe her a favor.One of Lemmon's last films, MY FELLOW AMERICANS is an hysterical road trip movie, as two feuding and bickering ex-presidents try to figure out why they are targeted for assassination. The cover-up goes ALMOST to the top.The dialogue is loaded with quick barbs and jabs, and the insults and the fur are flying! Garner proved in ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and its sequel that he is quite the comedic actor, and we already know about Lemmon's credentials. Both are used in fine form here. Even Lauren Bacall gets in on the act.This movie is yet another reason why we miss Jack Lemmon so."
2,"Nice Movie, bad DVD","I love the movie (average plot, but it gives me every time a good time) and there wasn't the chance of buying it in Europe. So I bought it from this U.S. store. But I could not believe it, the DVD ""fits your screen""! Meaning the aspect ratio is 4:3 - no (at least) letterboxes by warner. Really a shame."
4,My Fellow Americans,Two classic performers epitomizing the funnier Republican and Democrat traits playing ex-presidents escaping an unidentified ruthless current president. Subtle points made too.
5,"Great service, Good Movie",Ordered the Movie and recieved it sooner than expected. It is a Great Movie. Very Entertaining for all ages. If you want a laughget this one.
5,old vhs movies,"I like watching some of the old movies and have a seldom used vcr, so I sometimes take the opportunity to buy older movies at a really good price. This movie was in good condition and arrived in really good time."
4,Solid book,"I have planned several trips to Panama using this book. The writing is clear, concise, and is generally accurate. I wouldn't say the book has an excess of personality to it (you wouldn't read it for fun), but it covers just about everything you'd want to know for your trip.My only quibble is that this book needs to be updated. Panama is changing quite rapidly (the prices as well as the physical landscape) and a 3 year book will rapidly lose its value.All in all, still the best around at what it does."
2,Lackluster Mob Tale,"A straight up biography of ""Crazy Joe"" Gallo, who led a bloody revolt against Brooklyn mob boss Joseph Profaci in 1960 and then, a decade later, Profaci's successor Joseph Colombo. Nothing new or groundbreaking here. The author basically recounts Gallo's criminal career, the years he spent in various New York State prisons, and his murder in a Little Italy, Manhattan, seafood restaurant in retaliation for the attempted assassination of Colombo at an Italian-American Unity Day rally ten months earlier. (Colombo remained in a vegetative state and eventually succumbed to his wounds in 1978). Worth a read, but, again, very little in these pages that even any casual follower of the Gallo mob's exploits probably doesn't already know."
5,Hellcat Kicks'em In the...,"Wow! Now this is punk. None of that mass-market, user-friendly, pop-punk excrement you're bombarded with today. Take all your ""radio-punk"" albums and use them for what they're good for...drink coasters! Then go get ya' some Hellcat records! This is what punk rock (and Ska) is meant to be! Better get this album before thay're gone, punk!"
4,Can't complain,"About the same in quality as the first one, which was pretty damn good. There are some great ska songs on this one, as well as some punk ones. Crack Rock central, or whatever is cool, as is Buju Banton's piece. I was not especially impressed with Rancid's ""If the kids were united"", and i personally think F-Minus' contribution to the album is beneath crap. Other than that, if you're a fan of both punk and ska, and like some truly original songs, then by all means pick this bad boy up."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR [amt] ON THIS CRAP!,I thought this CD [stunk]... To start I should have expected it because it was only $4.97 for 22 songs and trust me....i found out why. I thought this CD had potential because it started out with the Dropkick Murphys but by the end I wanted to feed it to my cat. Dont waste youre [amt] on it because you will be disapointed.
2,NO GOOD,"This game is horrible, it is just a waste of money. If you're looking for good football action, get Madden NFL 2001. It is 10 times better than NFL Quarterback Club 2001. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,GET IT!,"I have played Madden 2001. It is exactly like Madden 2000. I think QBC 2001 is much better than 2000. It has new modes, more updated rosters."
3,Fun but annoying,"NFL Quarterback Club 2001 is a decent game. The graphics are some of the best that I have seen in a football game. The audio is the best when you turn it off though. The commentators say the same boring and not funny comments over and over again. This game is too much like the Madden games, in that whenever you have a lead the AI finds away to make your team fall apart so they can get the lead from you. This game is best played with friends because it takes away the annoying computer."
1,"Awful, awful, awful.","Let's see, Acclaim promised a slew of improvements, but the only thing I found that was improved was the pass-catching system. The defense only got worse. Power-backs lowering their shoulders works seldomly. It STILL takes players around 30 seconds to cross the field. Pass releases sometimes force your QB to stand still and get hit before they throw. Rosters are still an abomination. I think the people that said this year's game would get better made their mothers cry."
1,Very Deceiving,I am very dissappointed with this product. Not only is it cheaply welded together it was also broken. And the size is VERY deceiving! It is super small. There is no way that this product should have gotten a 5 star rating!
2,Poor design = annoying to use,"I really liked this clock at first, but then I discovered that their placement of controls was really poor. They've got a volume wheel on the left and a tuning wheel on the right. Not only are these easy to confuse (and the tuning is really difficult), but I find I bump them all the time while holding the clock, which I have to do in order to keep the clock from sliding away from me when I hit one of the buttons on the front.In the future, I'll look for a clock with all frequently-accessed buttons on the top where that won't be a problem."
4,Well...it's ok I guess,"The overall features are nice and the form factor is small allowing it to fit nicely on a nightstand. The TV band coverage only goes to channel 13, so you're limited there. If you can get the ""wire"" antenna positioned well, the reception is decent...as decent as you can get from a ""dial"" tuner rather than a digital tuner. The weather band comes in nicely and has helped me out a number of times from being drenched from an afternoon rainstorm by listening to the forecast.Once again, overall nice, with many quirks, but as an alarm clock it does its job. Yes the dials, buttons, dial positions, and sound could be improved.Here's the deal: If you can get this cheap...say for under 15 dollars, then in my opinion, the cost to value ratio is in your favor. You get a radio, alarm clock, tv sound, and weather for your money. Not bad. I bought this in January of 2000 and it's still on and working fine."
5,My Clocks name is Bob,"I bought this clock fully intending to name it Murray but upon opening the box I realized that this alarm clock was definatly not a Murray, it was more like a Monique or Dannile. I settled on the name Betty. Betty is an excellent alarm clock. Reliable, Smooth and Professional. With a contemporary look this alarm clock really excells in all aspects of waking. I highly recommend this fine product."
4,Solid product,"Having worked on both Macs and PCs with professional-quality design programs, I found iWorks to be a great fit for someone working on his own. The templates are easy to use and modify."
3,Never used it,"I have had the software on my computer for 2 years and have almost never used it. The times I tried, I couldn't get it to do the things I wanted it to."
1,I work o6 for mac,This product came without a serial number and when I contacted the company I didn't receive any help at all. I have yet to receive a credit for my purchase. They told me to throw it away. What I wanted was a product that works!
4,Good apps,"These are very easy to use yet powerful applications for OS X. As a Windows transplant, I still I still prefer the ""within-one-window"" program design. Having couple Mac programs open would some times give me 5 to 6 windows, i.e. font palette, paragraph formating, etc. Very cluttered."
5,iWork,"Want To Make A Magazine, A Show That Shows Info, A Book?Well You've Come To The Right Place, Cause iWork Is The Best Way To Do It!Part 1: PagesPages Is Good For Making Magazines & Books. I'm Making A Magazine Called ""Studs"". To Make A Good Magazine, Add Comedy, People Think It Is Funny.Part 2: KeynoteKeynote Makes Presentations, &/Or Info-Movies. I Made One Called ""Super iMac""! There Are Also Cool Transitions Too!The End!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Very nice fairly easy to learn... BUT!,"No spell checker! Oh sure it underscores a word if its spelled wrong, but how about help to correct it. Nope no help there, Got to buy more software, My new iMac is dollaring me to death. Granted AppleWorks 6 didn't have a spell checker but it did have a database, spreadsheet, drawing, and painting applications. So is this an improvement, or something new with less for more money?After all AppleWorks 6 came with OS 9.1"
4,Bandai Godzilla Action Figure,"Toy was received and was exactly as pictured, purchased for great grandson age 3, he was pleased and plays with it all the time"
5,I Can Problem Solve,Good book for teaching kids to problem solve. It's scripted for the teacher and fun for the kids. We are currently using this book in our VE class.
2,"Seemed like a great product, but definitely NOT air tight!","We used 2 of these containers for both of our cats' food. At first I was very pleased with these containers. They were big enough to hold each bag of food and easily scoop it out as well while being slim enough to fit in our small laundry room. However, one of our bags of food that we had ordered from our vet came (unknown of course) with flour beetles. The foods were seperated in these ""air tight"" containers so I thought they would have been contained in the affected bag. Boy was I wrong!! They were visibly crawling in to the closed top of the container holding the unaffected bag so that now we had to throw out both bags along with the containers because they were obviously NOT air tight."
5,"BenQ FP731 17"" LCD Monitor (Black)",The resolution and usefulness of BenQ FP731 is the same quality I see in the Sony LCD monitor. It exhibits excellent brightness and color and I would recommend it to others.
2,Too bright!,This monitor is blindingly bright. I spent several hours today working on a newsletter - my eyes hurt - my head hurts! I usually spend several hours a day on the computer & I need a monitor that does not 'kill' my eyes.The brightness adjustment is virtually useless. I have it turned down to 0 and it's still too bright except for just the top inch or two of the monitor.I will be returning this monitor & will get out my old crt until I can find an lcd monitor that is easier on my eyes.
2,Two years and dead,"Bought four of these for an office job. One just went dead - screen almost completely dark but visable in the contrast. Fluttered a few times and now dead. Trying to find cause, but must be in power supply due to no back light either. Oh well for the low cost - what do I expect?"
1,Very Ambiguous and Misleading,"In the product description, the seller should've included that the product was used/refurbished. I was looking for a brand new item. Judging by the price of the item, I assumed it was a brand new and never used/open item. However, it came in a messy box that was re-taped. I could've gotten a brand new one for around the same price. Before purchasing a product from this seller, always remember to ask if it is brand new, used, or refurbished."
5,El Nene is something that you cannot find everywhere....,"A friend just asked me to check it out without saying anything. My GOOOD! That is pure music, from the heart, with great voices. It is a nice surprise to see young generation from Cuba showing quality! I have not seen the enrire DVD, just some of it, and I loved it. If you understand Spanish, go for it."
3,Seems like forever,"Guys when is this gonna hit the surface, Im a huge smokie fan and dont have any DVD concerts on this group. I guess, this is really gonna take some time for it to be of optinium quality.Please Amazon, get this DVD out soon. Im looking for Pussycats and Little river band DVD's, any news on this..cant seem to find this group anywhere."
4,excellent classical type themes,"YandR always had the best background music of all the soaps, this is a wonderful addition to a collector.I wish all of the shows background music past & present was put out on a CD, very memorable music, more like Movie type music. Cheers to the music co-ordinator and the show!!!"
3,Not bad,"I love Y&R, and I didn't think the soundtrack was all that bad. Maybe not the best, but I love soothing instrumental music. I am still in search of that one piano segment that plays when Billy and Mac are together in a romantic moment. If anyone knows where I can find this then please let me know! I need that entire piano segment!"
1,Major Disappointment - WHERE ARE THE CLASSIC Y&R MUSIC CUES?,"I eagerly anticipated the release of this CD because ever since since I started watching Y&R in the 80's, I thought the background music was spellbinding, mysterious, beautifully orchestrated and far above the caliber of any soap's music. This CD, however, is terribly disappointing because the majority (like all but one) of the selections are newer music cues from the mid to late 90's that all sound quite similar. The don't have the familiarity and distinction of the classic music cues I was so hoping would be included. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
1,long awaited disappointment,"Like the above- I eagerly broke open the CD so I could hear all those tear jerking, beautiful songs from the 70's ,80's and EARLY 90's only to find they weren't on the CD. I can't believe that the very moving theme they always played in a touching moment with Victor and Nikki isn't on this CD...it was one of the main reasons I bought it. Y & R owes it to us long time fans to offer the earlier years music. Personally, I think the pieces of old were much better and more original than the ones they play lately and are on this CD."
1,Maskelyne's war records,"Jasper Maskelyne's war records have already been released!His son, Alistair, has a copy. They contain no earth shattering revelations, apart from transfer dates.I've looked at them.By the way, I contacted the Imperial War Museum (London) who said that there was no exhibition on Maskelyne in 2003 or at the other IWM sites. So can the previous reviewer clarify this?My alternative research on Jasper Maskelyne has been highly praised by key magic historians , but viewers can make their own mind up by checking out the website at:www.maskelynemagic.comDavid Fisher and Paramount Studios have sold us a dummy.Richard Stokes"
1,Author's Deception,"The War Magician by David Fisher claims to be a true account of the exploits of the illusionist Jasper Maskelyne during the Second World War. In fact the book is an invention, not remotely based on fact, and instead is an attempt to gull the credulous and make money in the process without the slightest concern for the truth of history. I have examined the records at the National Archives at Kew in London, where nothing supports Fisher's story; nor do the records at the Imperial War Museum. For that matter, the word in magic circles here in Britain is that David Fisher's book is so bad, his film treatment so feeble, that Peter Weir, who was asked to direct the film of the book for Paramount, has refused to do so, and the project has been dropped. That is how bad David Fisher's The War Magician is. It is junk for the gullible and feeble minded; it is a travesty of history. It is a lie."
1,Master of Make-Believe,"Fisher's account is semi-fictional ....I have actually researched the real background behind Jasper Maskelyne's war-time career and have corresponded with his son, Alistair who lives in Queensland, Australia.I published a lengthy series of articles in the Australian Geniis Magic Journal in the mid-90's debunking Fisher's fanciful account.Alas, Maskelyne was not involved in any significant camouflage work in the summer of 1940; his role in the protection of the port of Alexandria('41?) and the Suez Canal ('42) have both been exaggerated. Even his alleged involvement in the deception plan at El Alamein is open to question.David Fisher has produced a mercenary work of dubious historical value. Readers are welcome to contact me for the alternative version. ...."
1,Disney MP3 Player,"This was by far the worst MP3 player I've ever purchased. I'm a technical person and could not get the software to load at all. After playing with it for a couple of days I finally decided it wasn't worth the $65 I paid for it at the Disney Store. Fortunately, they gave me a complete refund. The instruction booklet is useless, the software doesn't auto load, and the only ""Cars"" logos are little stickers which will fall off. Very poor prouduct and disappointing. There's also no manufacture info to look up a website for additional info. Very useless! Save for an IPOD - they're great and easy to use."
1,Not worth the money,"It took a long time to figure out, how to install it. Now, I have the music on and gave it to my son as a B-Day gift. He was very happy, but it doesn't work.You have to charge it on the Computer with the USB Cable. It shows, that it is charging. When you hook it off it is on and works. But as soon as you turn the power off and would like to put in on, it doesn't work.Maybe I do something wrong, charging the unit or it really is just not worth to buy it.Maybe somebody who reads it and owns it aswell can help me on that?If you dont own it, buy a cheap ipod for your kid!!!"
1,I'd never buy another Kodak camera!,"I bought a Kodak digital camera and it has been fine. However, knowing what I know now I would never buy another Kodak camera. Ever. I dropped the camera, and a little plastic piece broke off which keeps the battery pack in the camera. Not a big deal. But NOONE repairs Kodak cameras. Instead you HAVE to send it into their corporate repair center and they instead sell you on trading it in for a refurbished camera. So, I can send this one in and for $250 get a new refurbished camera. Whooppe! But it only sells for $50 more on amazon.com - and thats a new, non-refurbished one! Its a total crock. Just be forwarned. I'd never buy a camera which I cant get repaired locally."
3,Getting drivers is a royal pain,"I resolved never to buy another Kodak, after upgrading my home computer. Getting new drivers for the camera was laborious, painful, and downright insulting. First, there's no ""drivers"" listed on the Kodak site, just this ""Easyshare"" thing. When you give up looking and ask for that... wait, you have to ""subscribe"" first. Then endure ads for their Ofoto service. Then you can't just download; they'll install directly. You can't use your computer for anything else while they're at it -- the Kodak download window grabs the focus and won't let you even LOOK at anything else.I'm still pretty happy with the camera, itself, but the way they treat customers is just intolerable."
3,I Like this camera,I had a Kodak camera before and really liked the ease of use. I was looking for something with a better optical zoom and this camera delivers. I opted for less MP to get a better zoom and it was worth it. There is a trick to taking a good picture you have to point tap the button wait for it to focus and then snap the picture. So if you need to take a picture fast it will probably come out a little fuzzy. I have 128SD card and it holds about 180 high resolution images.
5,Great Digital Camera!,"This is one digicam that takes pro quality photos. I've used it for four months now and I do not have any complaints. The camera is easy to use and with the camera dock, that comes with it, download pictures to your computer with one touch of a button. It is not a battery hog like other digital cameras I've owned. I would highly recommend this digicam."
5,This camera is great,"I love everything about this camera. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use. There are so many things it can do with this camera I am still exploring them. The only thing I can say is bad is it doesn't have manual focus. I didn't think it would be too big of a deal, but sometimes when I am trying up close shots it has issues. But other than that it is great. The quality of the shots are wonderful, I get excellent battery life. I definately reccommend this camera to anyone looking for such a good zoom and high resolution."
5,I Love this Camera,"I bought this camera to replace my Sony Mavica and have been utterly delighted with it. The 10x optical zoom is excellent, the controls are easy to see and use and I honestly can't think of anything negative. I'm older and like the feel of the larger size. It fits my hand. I don't need a micro camera that fits in a pocket so this is a good size. I get amazing quality photos with room lighting, even if dim. So, I'm thrilled with it."
3,First of McCloy's mysteries,"McCloys first mystery is OK, but she reached greater heights later on. One puzzle in this is how a woman dies of heatstroke embedded in a snowbank on a New York City sidewalk."
3,&#65533;A Talent for the Game&#65533; is a movie about overcoming the odds,"Although the story is light on originality, this is a great family movie about a small town boy getting his break in the big city. The movie boasts big acting talent with Edward James Olmos (""Stand and Deliver"") and Lorraine Bracco (nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Goodfellas""). The first half of the film is filled with wonderful cinematography of the beautiful landscapes of northern Idaho where Virgil Sweet (Olmos), a major league scout, finds the next pitching phenom, Sammy Bodeen (Jeff Corbett). Sweet just has to convince the town's stubborn preacher to let his son, Bodeen, go fulfill his dream of becoming a baseball star. Things unfortunately do not go as planned when the team owner tries to exploit Bodeen. Almost overcome by the high expectations placed on him, Bodeen finds success through the help (and trickery) of Sweet. ""A Talent for the Game"" is a movie about overcoming the odds, and leaves you feeling great!"
1,No Subtitles,"My review is based on Amazon's advertisement and not the movie itself since I'm not able to watch it due to the lack of English subtitles. Though Dead Eyes Open is listed as Full Sub with English subtitles, it is not. The Disc Menu also doesn't offer an option for subtitles and the Special Features just lists the making of Dead Eyes Open which is also not subtitled. Thanks a lot Amazon."
2,What happened to my bonus dvd?,"First off, let me start by saying that this is a 5-star album. Absolutely love this record, so I had to get myself a physical copy to blast in my car. My problem however is with what actually arrived in the mail from amazon. I was expecting the cd + bonus dvd, but the bonus dvd was nowhere to be seen. Another reviewer noted that he had the same problem as well. I would avoid getting this item from amazon.com because you may not get the bonus dvd."
5,Amazing album,"This album still blows me away after all these years. There's so much going on, you have to hear it a few times to catch it all. If I had to describe it, I would call it 'orchestraded hard rock/metal'. Emotionally high and low, between sadness and despair to hope and triumph. The music backs it all up like a sound-score. Not a weak link in the musician department, or vocally for that matter. Alder did a great job in the 1st post-Arch Era album. Matheos and Arresti are amazing soloists who also know when to reign it in for melodic effect as well as turn it loose for full-on mayhem. A very underrated band; this was maybe their finest to date."
3,Better than average,"I am trying to get into Fates Warning. I have Awaken the Guardian, and a later Fates cd that doesn't sound like metal at all. I like this ""No Exit"" cd better than ""Awaken"". Why? Mainly because the quirky vocals, and wierd time changes are gone on ""Exit"". Here you have some decent heavy metal with a slightly progressive bent. The vocals are very high--quite similar to the Queensryche dude. If you are a lover of all things metal, and like some intelligence added to it--try this cd."
2,Order arrived without the bonus DVD?,"Ordered this item on 3/28, arrived on 3/31. Was expecting the remastered edition of No Exit with the bonus dvd (2 discs). Although Amazon web site reflects discs: 1, the CD arrived and did, in fact, only include 1 CD (no bonus dvd). What was even more peculiar was that the product was shrink wrapped with the packaging reflecting ""bonus dvd included."" I contacted Amazon for a replacement, hoping that this was a packing error. They're overnighting me a replacement (and return label). Am anxious to see what I will get since this is a relatively rare item. Has anyone else failed to receive the bonus DVD w/ their order?"
1,no bonus DVD,The album itself was fine but there was no bonus dvd!!!!! It would be nice if there was one but there was not. I have been a fates warning fan. anybody who would like this cd will but there may not be a dvd in there.
4,"Good game, but gets a little boring.","This is a great pick up and play game, but it's not really a game you can play for hours at a time. It gets kind of boring after a while of playing, and there are to many load screens. If your into racing games, this might be for you. It's a great game, but it has some flaws."
5,Lots of fun...,"Finally got the PSP for Christmas and had to figure out what some good starter games would be... Well, after reading a bunch of reviews, I had to get Burnout Legends! After a few weeks...this game is awesome! So much fun and very difficult to put down! Easy to learn, fun to play, yet some challenge mix in it all.Definitely recommend this title!"
4,wow,"this is quite possibly the best video game out.... nice graphics, easy to understand, and fun. Whats not fun about crashing dozens of cars while going 180 mph!!!! its pretty sweet. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because it would be better if the cars were real brands. like midnight club or something. awesome"
5,Almost as good as the 360 version,"I first played this impressive game on the Xbox 360. I haven't broken down and bought the 360 yet so I figured that I would give it a whirl on the PSP that I own. WOW!! This game is hours of fun. Great graphics and control. You have to love the 'Crash' mode where you try to cause the most insane wreck. Buses, semis, and cars create a pile of twisted metal that makes me smile!! Check this game out. Plus the price is right."
5,Fast and Fun Goodness,"This version of Burnout for the PSP captures the essence of the Burnout series. Intense crashes, insane speeds, and loads of fun! If you are a fan of the Burnout series, or racing games in general, and have a PSP, you'll most likely enjoy this game."
5,YET another great psp racer! even better with a PSP for 12$!!! Brand new to!!,"This game is great, doesnt push the graphics so that you have all those loading times like midnight club. So if you like crashin and racing this is a must have!![...]"
4,"Incredible fun, but only for a short while","Like ""Burnout 3"" for the larger consoles, ""Burnout Legends"" is an incredibly fun game for a few hours or maybe a few days. It's the same formula as in the previous Burnout titles: you basically crash into other vehicles and try to inflict as much damage and mayhem as you can.Unfortunately, that's about it. It's fun and exciting enough for me to give it four stars, but I believe this is really a rental title. If you buy it, you are wasting your money. The fun and excitement wane quickly and the gameplay grows old fast. For me, after a couple days of knocking out other vehicles and setting off chaos, I had had enough. There's actually a wealth of ""missions"" included, but they are all similar to one another, so for me, the allure of completing them all simply wasn't a big draw.In summary, a really fun game for driving game lovers looking for a little action on the PSP, but it's just a rental title."
5,VERY GOOD,"ESTOS JUEGOS PARA PSP LE TRAJE AL ECUADOR PARA MI LITTLE KID RESULTO UN JUEGO SUPER ENTRETENIDO,CLARO FUNCIONO MUY BIEN EN SU PSP,ORIGINALES QUE ES LO MAS IMPORTANTE.RECOMENDADOS"
4,a real page-turner for foodies,"Echikson does a great job profiling all the players-with Loiseau as his ""mad bird"" at the center-and the teamwork and total devotion it took to acquire all the ""right stuff"" to earn three stars. It's an engrossing behind-the-scenes story for any serious or not-so-serious gourmand. Also lovely photographs enhance the text."
1,Don't waste your money!,"As sequels go, this may be the worst of all time......the Godfather III of video games. What happened to the strategy, deep levels, and intense action from ""Seeds of Evil""? Turok 3 is a HUGE letdown! The levels are too short, the story line, characters and weapons are unimpressive. Shouldn't game sequels evolve and be better than the ones that came before? Well, this one simply isn't. A future Turok release is hinted at, but I wouldn't expect anything spectacular based on this latest effort from Acclaim."
4,turok 3 review,"this is a realy fun game,although the ai humans seem a little funny like when you walk into a room they stand there for 10/12 seconds then shoot then another 10/12 seconds pass and they shoot again,i also was a little dissapointed with the ""oblivion""boss it looks a little weird and the multi-player mode dosent include my favorite character the campanigher.other then that this is a great game.i recommend it for any turok fan!."
3,not as good as 1 & 2,"There are some cool things about the game, like the designs and artwork but the graphics are not rendered as well as the other two games and the suspense is not as high. The designers also took out one of the best parts of the other two games, and that is the blood and violence. Before, you were able to keep shooting the enemy while he was down and watch the blood spill everywhere, and they also had more dramatic deaths as well. overall its not as good as the other two."
3,Turok 3? never heard of it.,"I returned Turok 3 after 2 days ,It's not that it's a bad game I liked the game play & the theme but compared to 1 & 2 it SUCKS!not what I expected at all! The graphics aren't as good niether are the weapons and plus I beat the game.now maybe I didn't see all that it has to offer in that short of time oh well,I should have seen this coming after that joke of a game Rage Wars was released.I do have 1 question to ask to the makers of the Turok games though( Where are all the freakin Dinosaurs!!!)man! for all of you die hard Turok fans out there ( like I am or was ) you might want to rent it first then decide"
5,Nice map,"This is an excellent map for educators if your desire is to give students a non-biased view of the world. Additionally, it is a great tool if your desire is to compare and contrast the various maps and the pros and cons of each. For those of you who are map collectors than this should have long been a part of your collection. Lastly, if your desire is to show the world in its most accurate spatial terms than the Peters Map is for you. I highly recommend it."
1,Terrible!,This CD is literally stupid. The singers are terrible and it is a waste of money. Who wants to be driving in the car listening to bad people sing? Once you buy it you listen to it once laugh for 2 seconds and turn it off! Why would you want to listen to that? It is literally a waste of money and I wouldn't buy this CD. Jamie is terrible but it isn't funny bad like William Hung it is just bad. Whoever buys this is wasting money and will be very sore in the ears after listening to it once.
1,Losers!,"I cannot believe someone in this world spent his/her money producing this piece of junk. The show was awful (although hilarious!); why do anyone wants to buy this horrible CD? I watched the finale in which Jamie had no clue of what was going on. And here, they reprise the Rosa-esque version of Bootylicious, in which I cannot understand a word she's saying. This is sad as in pathetic. The world is definitely ending. Hahahaha!!!"
1,Musical nightmare!!,"What is this?!!? I thought the whole William Hung thing was taken a little bit too far, but this tops him!! WHY would someone want to hear a bunch of talentless kids singing all these songs terribly and off-key? Too many people are trying to capitalize on the whole American Idol thing, and I'm sorry but it's not working. Let the bad auditions stay with American Idol... it's funny on that show, this is just making singers REALLY think they are good by letting them actually RECORD!! These poor songs! They've destroyed them! These poor contestants!!I would never pay money for this garbage."
3,Odd purchase for something so unpleasant,"Although the show is amusing, it's not a cd that is very enjoyable to listen to more than a couple of times. In fact the singing is so bad I couldn't even listen to the songs the whole way through. Instead of a studio recording, each song was just taped during the live performance and so not only are the songs very short, but the live recording makes their voices even worse.On the other hand it's actual proof that this show is for real. The reactions I got while playing it in my car with the windows down were quite interesting. I gave it three stars because I would recommend checking it out from the library, not purchasing it to own. Or buying it used at a discounted price. Although not quite worth $16+, it'd be worth maybe $9 for the fun you can have."
2,Not a book for historical taste,"Readers interested in historically authentic renovations or new construction of colonial, federal or classical revival style houses will not find much of interest in this book. The houses and furnishings pictured for the most part present eclectic blends of contemporary and historic styles. I would describe many of the ""colonials"" pictured in the book as postmodern eclectic. A number bear no recognizable relation to the colonial style.The text is typical of what you would see in popular shelter magazines like Southern Living or House Beautiful: pleasant, generally informative and upbeat but not very detailed, and of little interest to more advanced readers.One should examine this book in a store rather than buying it online, because the content suggested in the title is not what the book contains."
4,I do love colonials,I do love colonials and this excellent book gives a very good overview of all the aspects of colonials from history to design to beautiful examples. There are dozens of great ideas here to ensure that your colonial - or faux colonial - lives up to the most beautiful ethics of great American design.
4,"Colonials:Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling, and Building New (Updating Classic America)",Great inspirations and pictures that are very helpful.
4,4-in-one is fair deal,Compact and all-at-one-place. I use it for instant/immediate backup purposes. Then I transfer it to a hard drive where I keep them all though I have many drives already in use. But I have only very few with password security. Clamshell is convenient and quick. 4 disks give room for more. Even if I run out of 1 disk I have 3 more within easy reach.
3,"Raunchy, wicked, and fun","She got f***ed by a fry! Burger baby is probably one of the best songs on this album. It's so strange and hilarious. The girl gets pregnant by a french fry and almost has a burger baby abortion. She decides to keep her burger baby by the end of the song. Yeah, the whole album is like that. Strange lyrics that will keep you laughing for years to come. When I was trying to study for finals, this album kept me up even in the late hours of the night. Raunchy, wicked, and fun but may be too extreme for granny. Gravy Train!!!! sounds like the B-52s on an acid trip."
4,Trashy RAP CD!!,"...so I decided to leave a different point of view for other people who are curious about GRAVY TRAIN!!. This is what makes music fun. Loud, trashy electro! I really love how the vocals are a mixture of rap diva, riot grrrl, and a little bit of cheerleader thrown into the background. The keyboards sound so amatuer and cheap, that's why it's so good! Aside from the vulgar sexuality, I think the lyrics are pretty clever and playful. ... On this CD my fave track is ""Hella Nervous"". ..."
4,sucks so good,"my boyfriend just bought me this album for my birthday two days ago, and i've already listened to it ten times. the tunes are funny as hell, certainly, but also incredibly catchy. comparisons to peaches (and various other electroclash groups like tracy + the plastics) are definitely merited, although the addition of an obviously californian hip-hop sensibility in favour of (slightly pretentious) european-style techno beats sets gravy train!!!! apart. unselfconsciously dirty and silly. may inspire one to commit various unnatural acts."
1,pretty much the worst thing you'll ever hear,"terrible horrendous mind numbingly bad what else? hmmm i hope these people die a slow horrible painful death mu bf liket them and I am much less attracted to him after finding this out. if these people masquerading as a band can do that it doesnt really say much for their ""music"" dont waste you f*cking money"
2,Not quite...,"I was somewhat mislead by a Salon review of this cd. Here's the problem...the sound is, for the most part, really retro and edgy. It's LeTigre meets The B-52's. Unfortunately, the sheer vulgarity of the lyrics goes beyond even my surprisingly vast threshold for depravity. With the exception of ""You Make Me Nervous,"" this one is best left off your shelf."
1,no.,Horribly irritating electroclash. Just.. disgusting. I'm not a huge fan of Peaches but even she is a hundred times better than this.
1,"A novelty act, completely devoid of any talent","Gravy Train is living proof that even indie labels sometimes sign completely untalented novelty acts. Their music somewhat resembles the songs that Cartman & Co. sing on ""South Park"", except that Gravy Train's music is more amateurish and their lyrics are not funny.If you like Lolita Storm, Gravy Train should be to your tastes. Otherwise, you'll most likely find this CD a complete waste of money. Personally, I wouldn't pick it up if I found a copy on the sidewalk."
1,Arrived Damaged,"Not sure if this item was previously owned, but the DVD was terribly scratched and the DVD cover was bubbled like it was exposed to excessive heat."
4,Great features,"Why does it seem that the LOUDEST people think the least? THe HOLD switch should be on every walkman. Just use it religiously and you will never drain your batteries or switch stations in the middle of a work out. Digital tuning is a personal requirement and TV is a cool feature. I'm less impressed with the durability. I go through these every year or so, but I take it to the beach a lot. Headphones mediocre, so I use my own, so with the right EQ setting it sounds great."
5,What about her stunning looks?,"The editorial review mentions Samoa's stunning performances with maestro Jim Kweskin and his magic band on 'Now and Again' and 'Live the Life', but what about Samoa's stunning looks? For those who can't make it to a live performance, a DVD release is a must. 'Why don't you do right' by us? 'Put some sugar in our bowl'!"
5,IT IS A REALY GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,well i have played every backyard game ever almost except the last on i think i like all the games i played for hours on end but after a while the gameplay got boring and it was realy ease i won in basketball 109-22 and soccer 10-nil and football im not that good at that and base ball like 9-0 and hockey 11-1 it got realy boring crushing the other team the game is fun at first but it can get boring
1,Massive problems,"My son got this game for the holidays and we have had nothing but problems with it. This relates to the Backyard Soccer 2004 edition. It will not even play on my son's machine which is so far ahead of the minimum requirements it is ridiculous. Tech support has been horrible as all they keep saying is to reinstall video and sound drivers. They are also big fans of changing the monitor settings. I was able to get the game to work on a different machine, but even on that machine the game would suffer fatal crashes. I'm awaiting yet another e-mail from tech support. I have requested information about returning the game or exchanging it for another. If they tell me they I have to return it to the store I will go beserk as it was a gift from family in Florida and everyone knows how easy it is to return opened software"
2,Brain Mush!,"My kids love it (boys 7 & 11 yrs) but I find it absolutely useless. With so much really great software out there that kids love and parents appreciate for the learning value, I don't know why anyone would waste the money. In my opinion this software is as big a waste of time as gameboy."
4,Very low price to learn about slavery,"I have a large collection on slavery and African American history and culture so I was knowledgeable about most of the subject matter in this DVD. However, I would still recommend this film collection for those who are new to the subject matter, someone who is looking for a brief overview for teaching students or someone who just can’t get enough of the black experience. I did find so sections that did add to my understanding of slavery. The chapter dealing with slave riots was in depth and covered a number up rising and the section on the various black units that played a part in the civil war. Overall a good but, not great, film collection. But, the very low price makes the purchase a no brainer."
3,Not a great movie,I really did not like this movie. It was not at all what I thought it would be. No recommendations from me.
2,Too slow,Too slow moving repetitive school kids. Narrator was very dull and it didn't really cover what it said it did.
2,Disappointed.,I guess I was expecting it to be more like a movie [like 'Roots' or 'Amistad'] instead of a documentary.
1,Unfortunate,I only watched the first two parts. This documentary is more concerned with mitigating the atrocities inflicted on an entire people than giving an accurate portrayal. Save your money.(It really deserves no stars ... but that is not an option)
1,didnt like,this movie wasnt what i thought it would b in fact it was so boreing i done had it so long i havent even watched it al the way thru
3,Up From Slavery,It was okay. It could have been longer. I did'nt like the ending. It should have illustraated how slaves were able to survive after slavery without the Master.
2,"Decent, but there are much better options...","This film covers much of the same territory that previous documentaries have covered without adding any new insights. Having seen Orlando Bagwell's Africans in America (1998), this material is not remotely in the same class. As a history teacher I am always looking for new takes on familiar subjects that are compelling enough to hold the attention span of your average teenager--this film did neither.Best films about slavery:(1) Africans in America (very good!)(2) Slavery and the Making of America(3) RootsReconstruction:(1) Slavery by Another Name (very good!)Up From Slavery is nowhere near these other productions"
5,Very very good!!,"These DVD's are full of detailed information about such an important era that is often forgotten or over looked during our current times. This documentary along with ""Slavery by Another Name"" are a perfect combination!!"
4,Very informative,I liked this documentary which taught a lot of cultural knowledge regarding African American history. There is a lot to be learned here. A beginning helps but does not dictate your ending. All thing are possible through Christ. A must watch.
5,The best,This movie really helped me learn a lot more about the history of America. I would recomend this to everyone!!!
3,Disappointed,"I'm a history buff and also an African American. I didn't care for the portrayal of the institution of slavery and its effects on this country as a whole! I guess it's okay for a basic outline for those who don't know but as much as it did say, I think it left out a lot! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who I know!"
5,Works well,"As others have said, it's similar in appearance to a toy, but it works really well! The instructions are nearly worthless, I threw them out after about half an hour and put it together myself, mine came with all the parts, but I have extra parts left over that should go somewhere but I do not know where. All in all, for the price it works really well, and it's super light so you can transport it easily."
4,My Toy Lawn Mower,"It does look like a toy and feels like a toy, but it mowed my lawn just great! As with other buyers, I also found that the two screws that apply to hold the upper handle in did not fit, or so I thought. I was trying to use my auto screwdriver, but byusing a hand phillips, I was able to get the screws in.My next hurdle was raising up the wheels, then after reading the directions, realised it was easy to turn the hubcaps. Then, the grass catcher was spewing grass at me, until I finally noticed the little clamps fit in all the way around,I am accustomed to an electric mower, have a small yard, and I am moving soon. So this mower is great, as it will not weigh much to move. As far as durability, that is yet to be seen, so all in all, I will have to say I am happy with my new toy, as well as entertaining to my neighbors. Darl Milan, age 65, Nevada"
2,"13"" 8A Electric Push Mower","The height adjustment setting is not sufficient. Even on the highest setting the mower cuts too low, thereby, damaging the lawn."
4,25lb electric mower,"Well built, light weight (25 lbs). Mower is exactly what I was looking for as I need to carry a mower up steps to several different levels of lawn. At 8amps power some grasses may be a problem. The thicker heavier grasses may really slow this down. It would be better with a more powerful motor which would create more weight. The rear mower flap needs to be removed as it always flips the mower up when you pull the mower back. The blade is very dull and needs sharpening right away."
3,Wheel Problem,"The 13"" electric lawn mower works well, but it was a struggle getting the blade to the correct height. It came on the lowest setting scalping my lawn and when I couldn't find the proper instructions in the manual, I called. Well, it took 4 calls before I found an intelligent person who could help me solve my dilemma."
2,doesn't work too well,"didnt work for us.made wholes in the grass, didnt cut it even, really bad with corners.regret getting it."
4,electric lawn mower,You basically get what you pay for. This is a no frills electric lawnmower suitable only for small areas. The height adjustment is primitive but it works. The lawnmower gives a nice smooth cut.
2,Slow and weak,This mower is useless if you have more that 3 inches of grass. It keeps staling. The engine is just too weak. It will work only if you put it to highest position but then it barely touches the grass. It is good only for extremely small yards.
1,Great for Fitness Equipment,"I found this mower to be useless. I couldn't mow more than 1 foot without the blade stopping and I have a really small yard. And unless you have the perfect tools, adjusting the blade is extremely difficult. I guess there is a reason why they don't have this model on stock at the nearest Home Improvement stores. I returned it. The only good thing is that I got a good cardio workout. It is actually lightweight to move on level surfaces, but on the grass (8' X 8') it took me an hour and 1/2 to mow the yard. And now my yard looks really patchy, like allopecia, because I had to use the weed eater to help."
1,"Yard machines 13"" electric mower",The item is not what I ordered. The vendor subsituted another brand. The rear bag did not fit properly and was of poor quality.
4,Great little mower,"I needed a lawn mower with a small footprint because the patch of lawn I mow is an odd shape and quite small in size. This unit fit the bill to a tee and no damage to the environment. It puts out half the sound of a gas unit, is very light, and easy to store. My only complaint is the front wheel tends to unscrew from time to time but it takes 30 seconds to put it back on so not much of a problem. I highly recommend this mower if you have a small area to service."
1,Horrible,"Bought this is June 2004. Was never able to hotsync correctly. We use outlook express, not outlook so that is part of the problem. The sales people at the store were no help and did not tell me any of the limitations of this product. The price was what sold me. When I got on the web site I discovered that only more expensive models will allow a conversion to outlook express. With hotsync never working correctly, we never transfered data. OUR MISTAKE!!! The stupid thing resets itself. We lost over 200 addresses, most of them for my husbands' business. Called tech support. Only have a 90 day warrenty, give me a break. Will cost 25 dollars for the phone call and 75 to repair. Now I have paid for it twice. And that is if I understood their broken English correctly! Don't buy this product. Spend your hard earned money on a better product, with a company that stands behind their products."
1,Dissappointed,"To be honest, I was highly disappointed with this item (when I did own it).Things that irked me:The screen was crisp, but it was black and white and had no backlight. It did not have a 5-way directional pad. Certain games didn't work with it because it only had 2 buttons. Planning things was quite a task with the tiny screen and sub-par handwriting recognition, so I ended up not using the calendar more often that not.One thing that I did enjoy using it for was catching up on tech headlines with AvantGo.However, seeing as there are ridiculous holiday sales going on, I may upgrade to the Zire 31. I do find humor in the fact that whoever stole my Zire 21 is probably kicking themselves in frustration right now :-)."
2,Could have been great,"It is the Zire21 that introduced and addicted me to the world of pdas. And I loved the fact that it was simple, monochromatic, and cheap, with great battery... But it has too many manufacture problems to be considered seriously: I suffered from 2 hard resets while trying to download freewares, and 5 months after buying it, some electric component overheated for no appearent reason and now it is dead, with expired warranty (which is only 3 months).Conclusion: I still want a simple and cheap pda, such as the new Zire31, but am uncertain on its quality. Palm is making a bad decision by keeping the zire21 on the market."
2,Palm zire 21 does not work with 64 bit computer system- Vista,The Palm zire 21 PDA is not compatible with Vista Home Premium. It will not work with any 64 bit system. You cannot back up data on your computer due to this. Also you cannot enter data into your computer and transfer it to the PDA. It is very difficult to enter data into the Palm directly. It takes forever and many times the letter or number you put the pointer on is not the letter that comes up. The matrix is too innacurate to work with.
1,Should have listened to poor reviews,"I read all the reviews before I got the product, but I should have listened to the reviews saying the product is poor. I had it for 1 month and it reset itself 5 times. It would reset and crash when I tried to download games (so I stopped that) and it would reset itself when it felt like it. It lost everything. It was not a battery problem, or my computer problem, but the handheld itself. I don't want to waste my time on another unit and I certainly don't trust the PALM technology.It also does not have a backlight which is a problem.I have returned to a dayplanner."
2,How many times can it lose my data?,"I bought the Zire 21 about 4 weeks ago to replace my trusty old M125. It must've lost all my data 5 times already! For no apparent reason!!! Imagine what I go through when I haven't synced for a few days - I lose appointments, phone numbers, memos, etc."
2,Erases Data Near Cell Phones,"I also had the problem of my data erasing when near my cell phone. I plan to buy the Tungsten E instead. Palm support says the data erasing near cell phones only occurs with the Palm Zire 21 model. If you want an inexpensive model, look at the Palm Zire. Its functionality is almost identical to the Zire 21, it just has 1/4 of the storage space."
1,Waste of money,"The Zire 21 isn't worth even the low price you pay for it. It loses data constantly, has hotsynch problems that no one at Palm can solve, and is generally a very disappointing PDA. Save your money and get a real PDA from another maker."
4,sort of satisfied,"Well I have read the entire first page of reviews and while reading them, I found out that what the people were saying was true. For me it has been a good pda and hasnt had the problem of resetting near cell phones. To tell you the truth, at this very moment it is 6 inches away from one right now and its still working fine. So for whoever had this problem, I think its just bad luck. But in the past I have had to reset it myself because it would freeze up when I put certain games on it. So overall I think it was good and I didn't like the fact that there was no backlight. So if you are a first time pda user, you should get it."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible - Avoid at All Costs - Resets","I've had two of these (my own and gf's) and they both suffer from the same problem that renders them more than useless - they always reset themselves, losing all information. I don't know exactly what causes it but I would recommend you to stay away from this product at all costs!"
1,"Small, Dim Display says it all","I just wanted a basic PalmOS PDA to replace my battery-eating Handspring Visor. The price was right ($89 at Best Buy) but it turned out to be a terrible purchase. The display was so small and the contrast was so bad that I returned it the next day. I kept playing with the contrast control, assuming that no one would think of making a PDA that was so unusable in anything but an incredible bright room. I ended up buying a Palm m500 for $10 more and it, so far, is a far better device."
4,The Zire 21 Handheld,"It works beautifully, I just wish it had a light so I could see the menu items when I am not in a lighted area. Other than that, I am very happy with it."
1,Don't bother,It will constantly lose data! I still like Palm Zires but get a different model. I love my Zire 71.
2,Same problems!,"My palm just died, for the second time in less than a month! I've had mine for nearly 2 years, had never hot sync'ed it, and threw my organizer out when I got my palm. It was good for the first 2 years, and then phht! I wasn't looking for anything flashy, I wanted something very basic. All I needed was a basic organizer and phone book. Now I don't have either, and with no help from support. My problems seem like the same ones everyone else seems to be having, but I do agree--I'm very wary of buying anything from palm again."
1,Erases data regularly,"The Zire 21 regularly resets itself if it is placed near a cell phone. Palm support states that this is the only model they have which has this problem. However, they refuse to accept this is a defect and offer solutions. Their only solution is to keep the Zire 3 feet away from your cell phone. Yeah, right!"
1,Do not buy this handheld,This is a terrible product. Mine died 2 days after the 30 day warrenty ran out. This model does not have a backlit screen -- it is useless in dim light or the dark. Don't waste your money (or time) on the Zire 21.
3,"Does the basic job, but . . .","Bought the Zire 21 to replace a broken Visor Edge. So far it's working well, and syncs properly to Palm Desktop on my Mac (OS 10.3.5). The price was right, and it handles all the basic applications I need. My main complaint is the Zire's faint alarm sound. With Alarm preferences set to High . . . the Zire simply cannot be heard unless it sits on the table next to me! My Edge could be heard from the next room, or from inside my bag. The missing backlight feature is also a disappointment."
1,Loses all of its data without warning!!,I received the Zire 21 as a Christmas present. It has been just over a month and I am already unhappy with my Zire 21. Twice the unit has reset itself and all of the information I entered in it was lost. What good is a unit that loses your information?!?!?!The Palm support has been no help at all with this problem. Do not buy the Zire 21!!!!
1,Worst product,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband. I entered in all my personal data and appointments. Much to my surprise the next time I turned this on - all data wiped out. Repeated process and again all data wiped clean. Am returning for refund, don't want to take chances again as this seems to be a common malfunction with this product!!"
4,"Wonderful classroom book, directed reading book for children","Meet the North American Indians is a wonderful classroom book for children, grades 3 through 6. It teaches children, with simple illustrations throughout, about the Indian heritage of American, using several diverse Indian tribes. It does get into the serious hunting adventures of Indians, including whale hunting and buffalo hunting, with an illustration of Indians running buffalo off a cliff, so it is important for the teacher or parent to explain why Indians engaged in such hunting practices, that it was a matter of survival, and that the Indians never wasted a thing, as we sometimes do today. They used the skins, bones, and meet for survival. Additionally, it realistically depicts the fierce Creek Indians as warriors. This should be a book for guided reading, and it can be used to teach American history from the angle of the American Indian. It is an interesting book of value."
4,Finally!,"At last, Dragon's Lair can be played as it always should have been - in real-time 3D! I am glad to see this ground-breaking classic back and in good form. The look of the game is nearly the same as the original, but now you have complete control of your character. The developers have added some additional villainous creatures, but you still have the time-honored foes (Fire Drakes, Giddy Goons, Singe the Dragon). The game in its present state has 15 levels and over 250 ""chambers"" loaded with traps, puzzles, and secrets.The cel-shaded animation is smooth and looks simply awesome. (It even supports HDTV 1080i, for those lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this!). The music and sound is great, and you can expect hours of gameplay. The only downside of this new Dragon's Lair is exactly that of the original - limited replay value. But it provides a wonderful bit of nostalgia for us older folks, and the younger kids should get plenty of play out of the game."
1,not compatable,This has nothing to do with the seller but this is one of the very few xbox games not compatible to play on xbox 360. I was upset.
4,good game but a little boring,"The other guy complaining was right this does get a little boring, but hey so did the older ones. This one give you so much more freedom and is a lot of fun when you get going. The mechanics like him walking and jumping look dumb but hey his character is suppose to be that way. It's Dirk the Daring remember."
1,Pathetic !,"Aggravating for adults, not enjoyable for teenagers to play, and impossible to play for both! If you get it free, take it, the graphics are decent. It is seriously not worth [the money]It is difficult at best to control and I can't believe the designers let this go to market. I will never buy another game from these people."
5,Old Testament - Isrealite History and Religion,"Excellent book....illuminated many questions I have had for years, such as ""who were the Three Wise Men"".....Who were Jethro's people and why did he have the priesthood.....Who was pharaoh and why didn't he have the priesthood.......the chronology of the flood and subsequent re-population of the earth.the ""First 2000 Years"" was excellent as well......these books gave me an excellent, scripture based foundation to move on to further understanding of the ancients. The ""Law of the Covenant"" was helpful for me......I have much more appreciation for the Jewish laws, customs and rites. In truth....I would be pleased to learn more of the true Hebrew texts, laws and customs. By understanding this religion it helps me appreciate mine and the common source of the old and new testaments....as well as other scriptures and writings."
5,Excellent Read,Skousen has a very thought-provoking style of writing. A worthwhile read. Anyone with an open mind and an interest in God's plan for men would enjoy this book.
5,Emerson Lake&Palmer - 'Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970' (Sanctuary),"I've heard about this show before,never thought I'd see it released on CD.This hour long/five track archive set was reportedly ELP's second EVER live performance.The mix most definitely has a real 'live' sound to it.My favorite would have to be the twenty-minute epic ""Pictures At An Exhibition"".There are two cuts from the very first ELP album(the one that many still refer to as the dove album);""The Barbarian"" and ""Take A Pebble"" are nice to hear in their stunning world debut.Also sort of dug ""Rondo"",a song originally done by Keith Emerson's previous band The Nice.The eight-page booklet tells you about the festival in great detail.Highly recommended."
3,Good for history but...,This is good for historical purposes but it might have been good for performance purposes as well had Lake's bass been in tune with Emerson's organ. You'd think for their debut they'd have made sure everything was set to go.Can hear better versions elsewhere.
4,Good addition to the repeater system,"There's not much to say about this except that it's an additional antenna for the Delphi XM repeater system. It's exactly the same as the one that comes with the system, and works just as well. It's of good build quality and is small enough to fit just about anywhere. I use this in my office in conjunction with the repeater system that a co-worker and I share. Delphi made some really great XM products, and this is one of them!"
3,Help!!,"Is the Sims Double Deluxe good for those who already have Livin' Large, House Party, and the Sims Deluxe?? I have the Sims Deluxe and want to upgrade to the Sims Double Deluxe but, is it worth it if I already have ALL the expansion packs?? Please help!!!"
3,please help,"hello I bought this game for my 12 year old daughter. Once she strated to play she got addicted. I tryed to get her up from the computer, but she wouldn't budge. She was on it for 2 days. she stopped because her family had died in this game. She was so sad."
1,RIP OFF!,You can buy the same exzact game for less than 15$ its called the sims deluxe edition! the same exzact game! dont wast ur money!
2,Fun to play,"This is a fun game, only if there is nothing else to do. I thought it would be more fun than what it actually quoted. As far as putting YOUR face on a character, don't expect it to be a mirror image."
3,Sure Wut Ever,This wuz okay but I found myself sitting on the computer for hours trying to make some fake girl fall in love with some fake guy. When I told my older sister I liked the game alot she brought me back to reality. Its just a computer game. When I grow up Ill never be able to use a cheat code to get money!This is a bad influence!
3,Poppy Horror Picture Show,"What can I possibly say about Coax that hasn't already been said, ANYTHING, by the fact that I'm the first person to review this CD. First, the vocalist sounds like a combination of Chissie Hynde & Shirly Manson. Second, the music sounds like the score to the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". If you are a fan of the Pretenders or ""RHPS"", ""Fear Of Standing Still"" is for you. If not, heh."
1,First day problems,"This product is embarrasing! I bought a brand new one for my dad for his birthday because his old, crappy, Polaroid version stopped working. I plugged this in, hooked it up and turned it on. I opened up the dvd player, put a dvd in, and it played fine. Just ot test it out, I turned it off about 2 minutes into it playing, then turned it back on. The dvd part of this POS didn't work at all!!!! The VCR part of it worked fine, then when I switched to dvd these was NOTHING on the screen. I couldn't even eject the dvd from the unit OR from the remote control. I turned it off and on back on about 5 times and finally got it working. I got the dvd out, put another in (just in case it was the dvd) and tried it out again. It didn't work. I turned it on and off about 5 more times to get out the dvd out and packed it up.Before you buy a dvd player, do some research!!! You usually get what you pay for.This will not work right out of the box. STAY AWAY!!!"
2,The remote is a real piece of junk,"I found that the remote for this unit is really substandard. The player is so-so, but the remote has a short lifespan. One by one the buttons stop working and there are not enough controls on the front of the cabinet to be able to operate it that way. The problem is that I just bought a new TV and BluRay player, and the player is only ""backwards compatible"" to a point. Most of the homemade DVDs I made by borrowing a friend's DVD recorder and dubbing old VHS tapes over to DVDs have always played on this Memorex unit but won't play on the new BluRay. I had heard from some people that you do need a separate ""cheapo"" player for your homemade discs. So I had to pull this old Memorex out of the closet for those discs, almost-dead remote and all. I ordered a Logitech Harmony universal remote and I'm going to have to hope that Logitech's database has the files for this machine so the new remote will work here."
3,Trivial interest to Arthur & McCrea fans.,"I loved Jean Arthur in later films like Only Angels Have Wings and Talk Of The Town, and my mother is a fan of both Arthur and Joel McCrea, so I got this one for my mother just to see them in an early role. Frankly it turned out that's all it's good for. The plot concerns a feud between fishermen and miners up north, and a resulting love triangle, but it had me bored to the point I couldn't follow the plot clear through, started to nod off a few times. It's one of those early talkies that has no score, and Jean Arthur is in only a few scenes so it's hardly worth it for her. If there are any die-hard Joel McCrea fans left, you might like it."
1,not worth the time to watch,"this is an old poorly made and acted movie. It wasn't worth my money to ship, much less buy. Not even a good B movie."
4,Fun if your child likes to dance,"We gave this to our son for his 2nd Christmas, he was about 18 months old. He was slightly scared of the toy at first, but grew to love it quickly. My child enjoys music and dance, so he really loved this toy! We had it about a year and a half before the air stopped inflating properly. My son might've been a bit rough with it though, he would carry it around the house and play it in different rooms. Also, we had to change the batteries on this quite often since my son played with it so much!"
2,Not too impressed,"I ordered this because I believe the listing at the time showed this item as 13 Amp and because it had metal deck construction. I thought I was opting for a few percent more torque, and hoping for a more durable build. The unit arrived clearly labelled 12 Amp, and the build quality is only fair, even for a $220 mower. I tried a B&D mower before and didn't care for it's plastic construction, but these two are probably equal products. The B&D seemed little more powerful or free running. However, this mover has not really faulted me yet; the small cord routing bar is cleaver. After mowing, I will usually find a clump of grass that didn't cut well. I will keep and use this mower, it works for my moderate suburban yard, I expect it to last for several years, but I doubt I'd replace it with the same brand because the build seems a bit flimsy."
5,Great manual!,The manual came in perfect condition. It was just what I needed for my Anatomy class. I recommend this manual.
1,Product was not described well,"The book was not the text book i was looking for. the title was the same, but the book was not described as a workbook, which is what it was. I spent my money for something that cannot help me. Now i have to go out and buy the real one."
4,STUDENT FRIENDLY,The AP book is an International version and everything is the same as the orginal version. It is student friendly colorful and well writen in laymans terms.
3,John Cusick is the man,"John Cusick is great, he started his humor/musical writing on the John Cusick show, an Auburn, MA Cable acces (ACTV 11) cross between the Tonight Show and the Tom Green show. John had incredible talent at making people laugh, its too bad he didnt continue his show."
5,Doyle's best,"This is the best, of the best. I've always been a fan of Doyle Lawson in music, but this is the best DVD i've ever seen.Just to be able to see his band members from when I first started to listen to his music (1980)is like an answered prayer."
5,An incredible bluegrass gospel collection,"I got this for my mom for Christmas and we watched it, off & on, for over three days. This is certainly one of the most enjoyable Lawson efforts ever."
3,Mutual admiration society,"A mutual admiration society is at work here - Seth Faison and Paul Mooney (two of Amazon rewievers) are mentioned by McGregor in his book as ""people who made this boook possible"".While the book is OK, it peddles earth-shattering truths such as""mutual respect and equality are extremely important"", ""stress respect and equality with your Chinese partners"", ""be fair and honest"" - perhaps it comes as a shock to American businessmen that their Chinese counterparts (or any other nation for that matter) should be accorded such treatment."
2,Marginal Guide to Current China Business Environment,"Government intereference can derail your plans; ""Guanxi"" (connections) are of questionable value; The marketplace changes quickly.All of these observations and platitudes could be drawn from a comfortable armchair anywhere. There is little if any hard data, there are no refrences or appendices. In short, this is a series of journalist articles stitched together for an entertaining ""book"".Mr. McGregor will not tell you anything you do not already know - Some easily forgettable anecdotes, and bland recommendations."
5,"Lively, practical insights on business in China","China has a reputation for vast complexity, but journalist James McGregor demystifies many of its modern business practices by placing them in their historical context and explaining why the Chinese view foreigners with such concern. He is extremely familiar with his subject, shares great material, and deftly describes his experiences and the nuances of Chinese society. He enlivens the stories in this well-organized book with great journalistic detail. Each chapter starts with a case study from history or business, followed by the author's synthesis of the chapter's main ideas. The chapters end with bullet precap crucial points. We find this historically grounded, practical book essential for anyone doing business in China. If you need to earn the trust of Chinese business colleagues or if you must determine whether you can trust them, read on."
3,Not well done for a kindle,The cook book is very difficult to navigate with the Kindle.It might be better to get this one in book form.
2,Not ELP,"This is a big commercial sounding pile of nothing.The drumming could have been programmed and Palmer not even missed.Not a good one.It gets 2 stars because it is ELP,but other than that,a huge disappointment.Save yer money."
2,Mlesna has great tea.,"I have been drinking Mlesna tea for more than 20 years now. Tea bags are OK but if you want to enjoy tea, I recommend buying lose tea. Mlesna has loolakondera lose tea products. BOP and BOPF. They are great. Whenever I go to Sri Lanka I buy about 10 boxes of BOPF. I looked on amazon but they don;t sell this product. I hope amazon would expand lose tea selection. If you are new to tea drinking, this product is a good one."
4,The Coolest Game this Side of the Andalite Homeworld,"Animorphs, Know the Secret is SO COOL! Even though I've only got the demo, I know this game is a winner. You can do whatever the characters in the books can do even though there are one or two mistakes. One of the mistakes is the fact that Rachel morphs the gorrilla (which is Marco's best morph). But hey, who cares? I think that the battles are especially cool and intense, particually against loads of Hork-Bajir because it is easier than you'd expect to get killed."
5,Awsome game,"This game is one of the best games I have EVER played before. It has great action, an awsome story line, and is fit for any age groop. I suggest you order it today!"
1,It's disappointing,"This game is GREAT... for a short time. After some time of playing, you will discover that it is quite boring. The graphics are great but you have to go through so many tunnels, forests and it gets so challenging that you will not want to see it ever again.EVER! I have played almost until the end but stopped because of the many boring pathways that I have to go through in animal morph. All in all I would say that this game is great but I rate it with one star bacause it got draggy. Seriously speaking, I now think this game is such a drip! Buy it if you want. I'm not stopping you but if you get bored, there is no turning back. *_*"
2,This is mostly a review of the demo,"If this game is anything like the demo, perhaps it would be better to wait and see, in the demo at least the controlls were a bit obscure and the reaction time was less that desireable, also the graphics are sub-par considdering what windows is capable of. Some of the problem might be that I'm use to 2D game boy games, not 3D playstation games. I hope the real game explains how to control the characters better."
4,On the better side>>,"Animorphs is a good game. It has great graphics. If you are a fan of animorphs or like action, then get this game. You can be 1 of 4 characters and switch any time. YOu start of with base morphs and can aquire others such as a squirrel, a coackroack, and a gold fish. The are different challenges and battles. Yhe only bad point about this game is it leaves you hanging at the end. I'm sure there is another game sometime, though."
5,My kid can't get enough,"My son cannot get enough of this CD. He asks for it every single day. The songs are short, fun, interactive, multicultural (several in other languages), and a great alternative to TV (my 2-year old would rather listen to this than watch Teletubbies!!) It has 42 songs and lasts almost an hour. It is not really obnoxious music and even I enjoy it day after day! Give these Wiggleworms a try!"
5,One of the Best Baroque Collections,"I have owned this recording for many years and I return to it often when I want to listen to a variety of Baroque oboe music. These pieces are played the way I like Baroque music played with clarity of lines; with rhythmic jauntiness and exhuberance in the allegro, vivace, and presto sections; with elegance in the andante sections; and with an emotional, singing quality (without being maudlin, lugubrious, or bombastic) in the adagio and largo sections. Heinz Holliger's oboe solos integrate beautifully with the ensemble, neither overshadowing nor receding into the background. Despite the 1972 recording date, the sound quality is excellent, being clear, transparent, and detailed, yet warm in the basso components. Highly Recommended."
4,worked well in tropical climate,We used this while we were Honduras and it worked almost as well as Deet 100%
3,Mindless fun.....,"If you are looking for a deep plot, complicated gameplay and overall realism, go elseware...No, RUN because Serious Sam is NONE OF THE ABOVE, which, is not necissarily a bad thing. Remember the days when first person shooters involving a few stairs, maybe a door or two and wave upon wave of enemies flowed like wine? I sure do, and Mr.Sam breathes new life into a lost, but not forgotton genre. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Halo and other games with more than a doller's worth of plot, but when you arn't in the mood for the jibber jabber of mission breifings and actual reasons for going to a new place in the game, serious sam answers your call. The sheer numbers of enemies makes even a vertern Gamer cry out....That is, until you turn all of them into Monster-Kabobs with your handy little Chain gun, or rocket launcher, or heck, why not even a flame thrower.Overall Serious sam: Gold can step up and deliver mindless fun and even more mindless plot twists."
3,"Good game, but a rip off for the Xbox version.","This game originally came out for computer and the Xbox version has no new features and the same graphics and plus it costs 50 bucks, why get the Xbox version if you can get the PC version for 10 bucks, yes you heard me its only 10 bucks. The only reason I would buy this game for Xbox is if my PC couldnt run it but thankfully it can."
3,Good action game for renting!,Good action game! but I don't think it's worth playing over.I say rent it!!p.s. Turok:Evolution is much better.
1,"don,t expect much","BEWARE: Poor graphics, Very LONG load times, The game pauses in the middle of action for two seconds, I fell for all the good reviews this game got."
5,Some of it barely sounds like polka,"Some of the album has a definite polka sound, but a few tracks have such a heavy rock influence it doesn't barely sound like polka at all. ""Come Back to Me"" and ""Pretty Dancing Girl"" are examples, and two fine songs. The ""Polka Medley"" is great. I wish they would do some of those songs individually. Some of the record even sounds vaguely like ska music. I would highly recommend this to any younger listener of polka, and anyone who likes to dance polka. It may even appeal to some listeners of lighter core ska."
2,Badly in need of the influence,Anyone that has heard this cd knows that it is brilliant.Taken on the strength of one song I happened to hear (don't let me be lonely..) I am dying to purchase this cd.If you have a copy for sale or know who else might sell it PLEASE let me know.Drunkymunky@go.com
1,Overrated,"This studio recording masks the complete lack of a ""floor"" under Mammina's voice. It was painful to hear her perform live, waving her hands around, looking ""soulful"" and mangling the concept of pitch. The audience would have been spared aural pain had Mammina not been so heavily amplified. Highly overrated artist."
5,"Awesome movie, good for car and racing lovers","I can watch this movie every day and never get tired of it. I love to watch it and see how a small time drag racer, with little money to have no money and win the his way to keep his school open and to also win a scholarship to go to college. This action packed action movie is one of my favorite. Many great actors play star in this movie, and dylan has the fastest car, but things get hectic when his car is destroyed. Then when the fatman think he`s won, dylan, mellissa find fast freddy(Principal) has the 57 Chevy for the Twin city run, and time ticks as dylan beat the fatman. Sit back and enjoy this action packed movie."
3,Smokin Tires,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the racing. Some vintage cars doing some beautiful things.Ever want to see a 57 Chevy Fly?
3,BRUTAL METAL,"i am a long time listener of cannibal corpse and i noticed that george corpsegrinder just isnt as good as chris barnes for this band. corpsegrinder belts out the vocals way too fast at times, sounding like a death-metal RAPPER! AT TIMES. this is the best sounding cannibal corpse album, that might not be such a great thing though because this is not pop music were talking about and sometimes raw sounding production but still with enough clarity goes well with extreme music for example CRYPTOPSY. what is amazing aabout this group is how old they are! they must be close to or in their 30's and no sign of backing down or changing lyric or music direction, that is truly frightening that there are adults out there with a mentality of a 14 year old when it comes to writing about DEATH."
1,horrible,These guys r 1 of the worst bands i have ever heard i would rather listen to briteny spers or backstreet boy they suck
1,THE BIG GROSS GUYS NEWEST!,"What's this? Another cd buy the ever pathetic Cannibal Corpse! The CD's name: Bloodthirst(how typical). It's content: gross cover art, sick lyrics, butthead subject matter(disembowlment, mutilation, death, body functions), amatuer drumming, bad guitars, weak bass, you name it! While I agree w/ the dude who said Corpse is very trendy, I think KoRN is much better(there 1 of my favorites)! C.C. is just the same as any other silly death metal band. I call it DUMB METAL! Go listen to Metallica!P.S., Fear Factory is NOT metal. They're industial. Learn the facts."
2,Worthless piece of junk.,"I hope this album sell less than one hunderd copies, to see if this lousy band dissapears forever."
1,"If this is music,then so is a jackhammer and bowel noises.","I tend to tolerate any kind of metal, as long as I can sing along to it, but this was just a complete mess. First off, you can't understand what the heck the lead vocalist is singing (unless you want to take the time to read the lyrics in the album flap, which I guarantee will induce more vomiting than an adrenaline rush). Something about the band is that all their songs sound the same; music that is, except each time, there's just a different kind of growling. If you want true extreme metal, listen to Pantera, Fear Factory, or Machine Head. I'm sorry, but this sludge does not count as ""music."""
1,bleh.......,"I'm sorry, but I'm just not impressed by these guys.. I love death and black metal, dont get me wrong,, but this band just, tries too hard.. they think death/black metal is all just about being cannibals and drinking other people's blood,, when it's not..If you want good death metal check out In Flames, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Opeth, Dark Tranquility, or Napalm Death. This might as well be put right next to Powerman 5000 in music stores...."
1,Cannabal Corpse has no talent!,"I listened to the album with an open mind. I gave it a chance. Every single song sounds exactly alike. They are terrible. What do people see in them? I don't think I've ever heard a band that sucks as bad as they do. And what's with that ""singers"" voice. Oh, that right, he doesn't have one. Don't buy Cannibal Corpse's cd's, you'll wish you'd died."
4,Masters of Brutality,"This album is one of the best sounding albums in death metal. The production is intense. Loud, crisp and clear, the guitars almost have a warmth to them. Brutality never sounded so beautiful."
5,Very Impressive,"This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time, and like some of the others said on here if you don't like the genre then you probably do not know what you're talking about when you rate an album like this. Then again why would you buy a Death Metal album from an infamously offensive band if you're not a fan of the genre and are easily offended.This band is extremely talented and although the lyrics may be hilarious at times, Fischer's execution of the vocals is flawless. This album is in my opinion one of Cannibal Corpse's most well produced album, this album may be more than 10 years old but it definitely does not sond like it, so if you are a fan of straight up death metal with no ""core"" or ""djent"" crap then this album is definitely worth buying."
4,Their best with Fisher,"This is Cannibal's best album with Fisher. It looks like they actually reached the top with Fisher. I mean, Vile wasn't good, Gallery was good but lacking, and in this one Fisher is really good, the other guys too. So i think it's a good album, not great, but very good. But i think they cant do much better with him. It's better than Vile, Gallery and maybe even Tomb, but not the other Barnes' Cannibal albums and the Six Feet Under's too. Definetely worths buying, if you want a Cannibal album with Fisher, this is the one!"
4,Another top-notch serving of gory metal rage,"Although there is nothing revoltionary here, the Cannabal Corpse boys do it again on this new batch of gore soaked grindcore. ""Bloodthirst"" contains all the musical violence that fans come to expect, and the band still sounds like they are still on top of their game. Don't expect any gimmicks from this band or any attempts to attract the mainstream. No ballads of undying love, just extreme songs of undead beasts devouring flesh! No wispy violins, just wanton violence! No atmospheric keyboards, just chaos! Cannibal Corpse dwell in the palace of death metal royalty with a select few other bands and ""Bloodthirst"" is just extra polish on their crown."
3,Just not Cannibal Corpse without Chris Barnes and Rob Barret,Any fan of old Cannibal Corpse can see this album lacks too much. For one thing the songs go by too fast on this album its only 30 minutes long. Granted there are some good technical songs on this album. I did notice one song where the riffage sounded like a guitar riffage from Meshuggah. However I think George Fisher should go back to Monstrosity besides he was better in that band. Chris Barns was a better lyric writer for the band and his songs dwelled into the pyscology of a killer. Also I like they way he has his vocals change. To see this get The Bleeding or some Six Feet Under CDs. Otherwise if you are wanting to check out a typical Deathmetal album go ahead and get this CD. However I long for the old school days of Cannibal Corpse.
1,I just can't get into this album for some reason.,I been a fan of cc since eaten back to life and i love every album they've ever made but i just cant seem to get into this particuler work called bloodthirst by cc... I dont know--they just didnt seem into the music for whatever reason! The songs are all sound the same and for the first time seems like all fisher is doing here is growlin and not saying sh*t! Im glad that this was cc's only mediocre album tho. Skip this one...Buy cc's latest wretched spawn!!!! Bloodthirst sounds like a nu-metal album so just skip it...Laters!
1,Anyone can play guitar,"If you had to choose between snorting Listerine and then walking on hot coals or listening to this album, go with the former."
1,Good phone ...but battery fails,"I love the phone and its features, but the battery fails on you quite often. After overnight charging, it won't last for 3 minutes. After a few days of this, the battery completely fails. We ended up getting a new phone"
3,Let's Kill 'Em review,"Jon Leizmans book Let's Kill 'Em: understanding and Controlling violence in sports is a book that addresses the issues of violence within sports in the western culture. This is a book for the well educated and who want to learn something about the issue of violence in sports. There has been many instances in the past where sports have been know for violent behavior and in this book Leizman goes over issues that shows the origins of violence in sports. He writes as far back as the Olympics and progresses to the present day. This book was written to further prevention of sport violence and Leizman gives us different ideas on how we can stop this problem. Leizmans talk about how we can use martial arts to learn how we can control our tempers and for those who are unable he talks about bringing up stiffer fines and penalties to reduce the occurences. The book as a whole was very interesting and enlightening, but younger readers beware this book can be confusing at parts."
3,Not as good as previous GF albums... But it still ROCKS HARD!,"Certainly, even when Todd Rundgren tried to repeat the success Grand Funk reached with ""We're An American Band"", he couldn't hit the target the same way.""Shinin' On"" is not as good as previous G.F. albums, but even though it is a good album!Best songs: ""Shinin' On"", ""To Get Back In"", ""Getting Over You"", and a funny remake of ""The Loco-Motion""."
4,Good follow up to 'We're an American Band',"I've come to appreciate more then ever the post-Terry Knight era of Grand Funk Railroad (in particular their 'Good Singing Good Playing' album) and 'Shinin' On' is nearly as good as its predecesor 'We're an American Band'. Having Todd Rundgren produce was a genius move, since GFR by 1973 could have used some better production and overall help in bringing out the best in what they could do. Standout tracks for me are the title track, ""Carry Me Through"" and ""Destitute adn Losin'"" Of this period of GFR I would also recommend the very underrated and overlooked Born to Die album."
2,Digital Remaster???,"I've been gradually replacing all of my older CDs with digital remasters, so when I purchased this Grand Funk CD, I thought I was going to get one that was whisper quiet when it was supposed to be in a song and between songs. Yea...right! If this CD is what Capitol records is trying to pawn off on the customer, then these clowns need to learn what ""digitize"" actually means when reissuing a studio album. I'm sitting here listening to this CD and I'm EXTREMELY dissapointed at the quailty of sound. If I had known I was going to get a professed ""digital remaster"" of such obvious poor quaility, I wouldn't have wasted my time, effort or money searching for and purchasing it in the first place. Hopefully, Capitol will step up its game and begin offering true digital remasters in the cataglog in the future."
3,"not bad, but definatlly not marilyn manson","Damn! bought this cd by accident, made another blunder. Oh well.....not to bad though. I just hope there are no more mansons out there to confuse me lol :}"
4,Went great with Grow- A - Frog,This book was helpful telling the story of how the tadpole changes to a frog
4,Great for the somewhat beginner!,This pamphlet is almost the exact one from my training in the 70's! teaches the beginner the hows to get started! BUT follow instructions! You could hurt yourself and/or others! Death is a possibility!
2,not good,Me no likey this book. Wanted to blow up piggies running on rednecks farm but no white man help in this book. Crab rangoons rock this book not.
4,Best Skating Dinosaur Spectacular Ever,At the Movies is really good but this tape is worth the price for Reptar on Ice alone. Operatic treatment of skating dinosaur show is hysterical; my husband and I sing it around the house all the time. Kids love all Rugrats but the best ones are for grown-ups too.
3,Um...yeah...,"Entertaining? Quite. If you are at all a fan of the subject, you'll get a laugh or two. The book reads like a conspircy-minded website, not a whole lot of material to back up the various author's claims. When some soure material is mentioned, it's usally in the form of a single book, magazine, or article.All in all, a fun read, but I have seen better from Keith."
1,NOT WORTH EVEN 1 STAR,LIES...MADE UP STUFF JUST TO BANG A BUCK...YOUR BETTER OFF PUTTING YOUR MONEY INTO THE GARBAGE THAN BUYING THIS WASTE OF PAPER. I BOUGHT IT THEN RETURNED IT. DON'T BE A FOOL. RUN
1,for Haters,"See the swastika on the cover? I bought the book and then returned it. Don't waste your time. You'll find more secrets in your local newspaer than here. Sorry guys, this book is just not woth the paper it is printed on."
2,Disappointed!,"My only expectation was that the strap looked like the picture but it doesn't. Notice the picture has some sort of design in the cloth. Nope! No design, just a boring worn looking cloth. Someone should be ashamed of themselves using a misleading picture like that."
3,Pretty good game,"The first game I played of NBA Jam 2001 I was bored to death. Then I got a novel idea and opened the manuel to see if I could make the game more exciting. There I discovered some extra options and once I started adding some of the extras it became a good way to pass the time. The power up items that you can pick up off the court are the best part of the game- going for a shot that is worth 9 points is a lot more exciting than a two pointer. I did find the controls a little difficult to get used to, however after a couple of games I was destroying the computer. The most frustrating feature of the game is that you have to keep track of passwords to continue your season (I haven't had to do that since I bought my original Nintendo back in 1987). If you are looking for a realistic NBA game that simulates real life play this is not the game you want- but if you want an arcade version of wild hoop then it's a good start."
3,A Decent Read,"This book is a pretty good read concerning the ""hidden church"", or the church that is within. I think too many of the occultists tried to read more into than was really there. Instead of the hidden church referring to some secret occult mystery school, I believe Eckartshausen was simply referring to those who have had a mystical experience of God; therefore, they know the church to be something within, and not the external edifice, its rituals, and its laws. It is quite the stretch to believe the author was using secret language that speaks of occultism. You be the judge, though."
4,A Very Nice Budget Lamp,"The best thing you can look for in something as simple as a lamp is function and construction quality. This lamp has both - a fully operational full-range dimmer switch, and thick brushed steel. Another nice feature is Masterglow - which puts a light sensor on the pole of the lamp resulting in automatic operation. You can set it so as it gets darker in the room, the lamp automatically turns on and begins adjusting its brightness according to the darkness in the room. You can also manually control the brightness with the knob, and turn the Masterglow feature on or off.Overall it's a nice, solid lamp at a great price!"
1,Bad design!,"I purchased this item because I am a teacher and I wanted to put a collection of literary figures on my desk. Shortly after taking the figure out of the box (literally, within minutes) a colleague was looking at it and went to raise the figure's left arm. She did not apply unnecessary pressure but the figure snapped in half. When I looked at the broken midsection, I noticed that the top and bottom were held together by less than 1/8"" diameter semi-circle of plastic (an amount slightly larger than the largest part of a toothpick). I feel that the design could be improved greatly. As Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors, I am dissappointed that so little attention was paid to the design- especially since she is known for her great attention to detail. Sad, sad design."
5,A Whimsical Delight,"This was a gift for a friend who is a big Jane Austen fan. It was a big fun hit!! I found the doll to be beautifully made with charming detail. I think I'll get another!!! Actually, don't tell anyone, but right now she's sitting by a figure of Mozart and I'm not sure they're not up to something when we go home at night."
2,JA Action Figure,"Pretty much what is advertised. However, be careful when you take it out of the package. Mine wouldn't separate from the blister package without a hard nudge, which resulted in my JA action figure breaking in half. Her 'hips' broke. Had to super glue. Just be careful when taking it out."
3,Disappointed,"Really a cute product for the Jane Austen fan. I had ordered this for a friend as a gift, and then ordered a second one for myself. I was disappointed at the quality of the paint job. There was missing paint and chips on it. The person that shipped it out did not check product quality before boxing it for shipping. Since it was under $10 it wouldn't be worth sending it back for replacement on shipping cost. If you order this - I wouldn't count on it for a gift as you may get one that has a bad quality paint job."
4,Charming Figure,"I'm an avid Jane Austen fan, so when a friend gave me this figure as a gift I was thrilled. It definitely isn't a toy. An arm came off immediately, but it was easy to reattach, and the book is lying next to the figure.Nonetheless, I love it, and it is sitting next to an autographed picture of Colin Firth in his wet shirt - also a gift."
3,Not chosen as a toy but as a literary figure,"Figure has good detail with book and writing table. Book fell out of the hand and could not be reinserted, but otherwise a good representation of Jane Austen."
5,Nandos everyday in the USA!!!,"Everytime I visit Slough (UK) from the US I eat at Nando's. In fact, I eat there nearly everyday. Why? Well...the only other viable food choices in Slough are: spread meat sandwiches (with butter, sweet corn, free-range eggs, rocket, and mature cheese) at Amys (yuck!)...""unnamed"" department store (made me sick)...or McDonalds/Burger King/Pizza Hut/Subway (I can get those down the street). But most importantly, it's the Peri Peri Sauce!Though created for Nando's chicken, Peri Peri sauce is especially tastey as a dipping sauce for french fries. Thanks to Amazon.com, I can enjoy Peri Peri sauce everyday right here in the United States.Warning: the ""hot"" is plenty hot enough. The extra hot is ridiculously hot!"
5,Nando's Peri-Peri Sauce,"Very good and tasty product. A little hotter than I normally like on meats and eggs, but very good nevertheless. For those who have been to Portugal, or are dreaming about going there one day, and are fascinated by the Algarve's Guia Piri-Piri Chicken, this sauce is just the thing. I think that on a re-order I'm going to go with something a little less hot, but I still am planning on buying from Nando's."
1,Pseudoscientific...,This book has ne basis in scientific fact whatsoever. It makes no valid attempt to present proper logical science in no way.
3,good idea but annoying and cheap,The idea is cute but it falls apart way too easily so it is not fun anymore. Plus the phrases are really annoying and have nothing to do with what the child is actually doing.
3,"Fun, But Not So Sturdy","I bought this toy for my 2-year old triplets last Christmas. In concept, it is a fun toy...the kids had fun pushing the little squishy truck in the garage and on the lift (although I had to help them move the lift up and down). The little phrases are also cute when the button is pressed and when the lift is moved. The problem with this toy has been that the ramp and car wash attachment are constantly falling off, making it frustrating for our kids to play with. Otherwise this is a cute and fun toy."
4,Good knitting reference,"I purchased this copy of the book recently for a group of women who teach knitting who had expressed interest in finding a reference that could be used for basic sweaters in any weight of yarn and sized for babies, children and adults. I have had my copy of this book since it was first published in the 1970s, and have found it indispensable in my knitting development. If you are a knitter and can obtain a copy of this book, by all means, get it."
5,wow,"Hey, someone can tell me what happened in these book because I dont have it.I live in Mexico so here the book finished in the number 21, and I am very anxious to know if Adam and Cindy are going to be boyfriends! or if Bryce continue with Cindy. Really I want to know if someone knows you can write me or send me an email to: [...]Well thank you very muchbye!!!!"
3,Good but needs a dimmer switch,"Can't really complain, given the low price on this item, but it would be nice to have a dimmer switch (pretty bright light for a bedroom)."
3,Too bright!,"It works well, but the LD display is brighter than a nightlight and has to be faced away from the bed in order to get any sleep--and it's still too bright."
1,poor materials,"After 3 weeks of use this light it is falling apart. The plastic used for the case of the light cracks very easily. Pieces keep breaking off. It has not ever had a major fall. The batteries are even worse. My battery had a small fracture, I pulled it out of the charger one day and it crumbled in my hands. I am very dissapointed in this product and have no respect at all for Makita products. It would be expected that makita products would be better than they were 10 years ago, but they are far from it. There is no quality to this light it is a complete rip off. I had to cover the whole thing batteries and light in JB weld to try to save them. I thought the high price was for quality but I was wrong. If I could give this a lower rating than a 1 I would. I urge everyone not to purchase this flashlight. I am sure it is the same with the 14.4 and 18 volts, they seem to use the same material for everything."
3,"Good, but a disappointment","Mae Robertson's first two CD's (All through the night and The sun upon the lake is low) were so terrific that I gobbled up this one and assumed it would be more of the same.Not so. The voice is still terrific, but the song selection just doesn't make it somehow, and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because Don Jackson wasn't apparently involved in this one, as he was for the first two.Now she has a fourth CD too, again without Jackson, and the snippets I heard of it at Amazon all left me cold. I'm not going to order it."
3,Not as useful as I hoped,"Beware that this book is quite outdated by now: some of the APIs described in the book (e.g. ""Field.Keyword"") don't work anymore in recent versions of Lucene, lots of new stuff isn't covered, some information (such as that IndexWriter can't delete documents) is no longer true.It's still useful as a ""Getting Started"" tutorial, because there's no such thing in Lucene's official documentation, but the price is a bit high for that."
5,To the point.,Using this book I had a finder window up and running in our Java application in a couple of hours. The book has great examples and you don't have to do a lot of reading to find out what you need to know.
4,Useful but the details are out of date,"Good for learning the principles and has a good overview of the classes and building blocks of text search, but many of the sub-classes have changed since this edition was first published. Unless you are in a hurry to learn Lucene (I was, and it certainly helped) I would wait until the next edition comes out in September (2009)."
3,one more okay book,This is like a cross refrence book where on each page it refers to other chapters or pages atleast three times. And i would just say it's okay. It doesnt even teach how to crawl web in a good automatic way.
5,Makes learning about Lucene easy,I bought this book to learn about Lucene. The book is a very good introduction to the package and Teaches you how to customize it for your needs. I am reading this book concurrently withInformation Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Enginesand understanding the theory makes decisions taken by the designers of Lucene clearer. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to build a customized search package.
3,"Good book, does not matter","Book is well written, great examples, good in every respect except one.. It no longer matters.. Why even finish writing this book, they should start on one for the current version and give at least a free electronic copy to the people that bought this one.. We live in a fast paced world, I understand that.. The book is good, no doubt, but can we have one for the current version? Major classes are now deprecated, like HIT class.. Kind of defeats the purpose for having this book... The book is good, he did a great job, or is doing a great job, it is a work in progress.. but why continue, right?"
5,Must-read for anyone using Lucene,Lucene In Action is well-written and easy to understand. It provides in-depth coverage in key areas such as indexing (tokenizing) and retrieval. Definitely a must-read for anyone learning or working with Lucene.
4,It's a winner!,"This is a cute story with characters that the kids know and love from TV. Easy to read and even very young children can help ""read"" it with the pictures."
1,ahhhh!!!,"what to say what to say...hmmm if you like playing a game that centers around skittles than this is your game!! I so enjoyed hearing the word skittles ever ten seconds. it would be okay, if was easy....but no, its one of those games that is cheesy and its fairly hard to play....dont buy it at all!!"
2,The name says it all,"If not for the horrible controls, Darkened Skye would have been a great game. Unfortunately, no matter which way you set your configurations, the game remains frustrating. One of the problems is one so common in third-party Gamecube games: functions of the L&R; buttons suffer from the ""click only"" effect, meaning you have to press them all the way in for a response. This is apparent also in BloodRayne, NAMCO Arcade Museum, and Evolution Worlds, among other titles. I don't know why third-parties do this -- it irritates the hell out of me and I'm sure I'm not the only one.Anyway, this is one of those medieval settings on no particular planet. You play as Skye, a sarcastic teenage girl on a mission to stop something-or-other. I don't mind the dumb idea of using Skittles as magic; actually I think it's kind of cute. The dry humor is almost funny too."
1,Shameless Marketing Ploy,"Darkened Skye is made by whoever it is that makes Skittles. You go around a generic fantasy kingdom trying to find Skittles to keep an evil wizard from making everything monochromatic (isn't that the plot of most Care Bears episodes?).The gameplay is horrible; it's an ""action platformer"" with terrible platform recognition, graphics that would be shameful four years ago, and some truly awful voice acting.Frankly, this game is bad, bad, bad, and I'm surprised it's actually gotten decent reviews. From beginning to end it stinks."
1,"Bad game,really bad game","In few words ""this games sucks"".It's got to be one of the worst games out there for the gamecube.The gameplay is awful and awkward,graphics look like a PSone game,the story wants to be fun but it just doesn't cut it.If you want to save some money please don't buy this game."
4,very simple watch and looks okay,"Very simple watch, looks okay and very cheap too.. Not bad at all for the price."
2,Out of power,"I may have gotten a lemon, but I've had problems with the solar feature. In typical day to day use (I work in an office setting) the watch would eventually run out of power, usually 3 or 4 days after the last prolonged outdoor exposure. Rather than entering the powersave mode, which I made sure was activated, the analog hands would keep moving, but the digital memory would reset to midnight, Jan 1, 2000. Very frustrating as I'd have to reset it from scratch. Was bad enough that I had to buy a new watch. At least it was cheap."
5,Got my 9.6 volt light working!,My old 9.6 volt makita light is now working! Comes in Makita packaging. Original replacment part. hard to get these bulbs locally.
4,Reign is Great,His song the Reign is his best since his second Box video how many want to die with me this is pretty good and Clap Backis and average joint all the way throught.The Reign-Lyrics 10/10 Production 10/10 Overall 10/10Clap Back-Lyrics 4/10 Production 5/10 Overall 4.5/10
4,Sink me! This is great!!!,"I've had a video of this for years...it was wearing out. Now I'll be able to watch the DVD for years to come. This is absolutely one of the most entertaining movies I've seen. The music, costumes, scenery and actors are fantastic! If you haven't seen it, you will love the ending!"
5,The Scarlet Pimpernel,"This is a terrific video and perfect family entertainment of an historic event (the French Revolution's ""Reign of Terror"") and love story. Anthony Andrews , playing the title role, along with Jane Seymour and all the other cast members could not have been better selected for their respective roles: actors, scenery, sets and locations were fantastic. The Scarlet Pimpernel precedes 007 by 175 years, but rivals his wit and skill of fooling his antagonists. The final charade at the end takes the cake."
5,Old favorite,"I've loved this novel, the black and white movie version from the 20s, and this final movie version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymore. It's a wonderful story, beautifully filmed, and well acted. It's an all-time favorite."
3,Romantic but a bit slow,"Although I love the actors in this version, if you're looking for action, the B&W version is a bit better. But the beauty of the color, costumes and people is wonderful. Jane Seymour is the ultimate beauty and I couldn't wait until she knew her love was the hero and the hero was her love."
2,DVD frozen on scene unable to complete movie,"I need to know my recourse, I have tried everything I could think of to complete this movie, but I am unable to get past the scene in which Armand is found out after courier is ambushed...I am very disappointed."
3,"Fun, yet not what I expected","My sixth graders and I read this book, and we absolutely fell in love with it. We just had to watch the movie so I bought it, but we were sad to realize that this movie was a combination of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Eldorado (the sequel to the book). We had fun watching it, but we all wished they had made a movie of just The Scarlet Pimpernel."
3,A Pale Immitation,"Anyone who has seen the great Leslie Howard in this role knows that he was the definitive Scarlet Pimpernel. While Anthony Andrews tries his best, he isn't quite up to it. Watch Howard's eyes as he switches between personas--it's obvious he was born to play this role. Sink me! Merle Oberon as Lady Blakeney, however, is another story..."
5,My Favorite Version,"The Scarlet Pimpernel is an adventure story and romance, and this is the best of all film versions. Fabulous and full of the fantastic, from scenery to costuming, music and the gentle sarcasm that weaves the story together; the action is full of excitement and the romance is worthy of a sigh."
4,Pimperlicious,"If you enjoy the kind of old school, Robin Hood swashbuckler war hero style coupled with a very young Jane Seymour and Ian McKellan (before he was Sir) and you will have an enjoyable family movie night at home. However, it would be good to know your French Revolution history prior to viewing... along with some basic folklore of who the Scarlet Pimpernel was will help with the back story."
5,Classic,"If you like Jane Austin or period romance pieces you will love this movie. I do! It is difficult to find though. No digital enhancements or green screen filming, simply good acting with a good story line."
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie. I watched probably 30 times as a kid and had lots of lines by Sir Percival Blakeney memorized. ""Sink me! Your tailors have betrayed you!"""
4,Well done,I love lavish DVD's...and this was another good one. Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews are good actors to watch in anything.
5,I admit I am part of the cult following,"I first watched this movie 15 years ago, and it remains one of my favorites of all time. In my mission to ""indoctrinate"" others I have shown this movie to many different groups of people and have found that it is a sure hit in almost any group. It has something for everyone: humor, adventure, romance, suspense. The dialogue is witty and memorable, and Anthony Andrews is superb (and very winning) as Sir Percival Blakeney. This is one that can be enjoyed over and over (and over, and over . . .)"
5,A CLASSIC!!,"We saw this movie many years ago when a friend loaned a VHS tape to us. I have checked Amazon multiple times over the years for this title, but it was never available. Recently I checked again, and to my great surprise and delight, Amazon had it on DVD. I ordered it right away, and already we have enjoyed it a couple of times. It's a totally fun movie for those who enjoy that genre of movies. It reminds me of Pride and Prejudice. There's some unexpected twists and turns, and of course, the good guys win, without all the gratuitous blood and gore found in so many movies today."
5,"Love, Love, Love...The Scarlet Pimpernel!!!","I have so often thought of this movie over the years and was so delighted when I found it sitting very prettily in my recommendations list! When I first saw the title I thought surely this can't be the actual tv movie I saw so long ago. With breath held I clicked on the link and when it opened I would have jumped up and down for joy had it not been for my broke knee. I did, however, do I happy dance in my chair!! I added it very quickly to my cart and checked out. With my Amazon Prime subscription it was here in two days! As soon as UPS delivered it I opened it up and popped that baby in the blu-ray player. As soon as Anthony Andrews talked I laughed out loud. The movie tells a great story, but Andrews character just makes me smile and laugh. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie again and will watch it again and again. Thank you Amazon!!!"
5,I Heart This Movie,Am I a cheeseball? Yes. But this movie is just so wonderful. and this is the best version of the story. The actor who plays Percy is so good! *sigh*
3,"Great movie, bad quality","I cannot elaborate on how great a movie this is. The other reviews do it justice.However, the quality of the DVD I purchased leaves much to be desired. If you are the type who values crystal clarity and vibrant colors, look elsewhere. If you are the type of person who gets lost in the movie and forgets about the presentation, this product will serve you well."
5,Book vs. Movie,"As it happens with numerous book to movie situations, the movie differs from the book. Alas, as Harry Potter proved, that is not always a bad thing. This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is definatly a case of the movie being as wonderful as the book.This particular movie integrates not only the original book, The Scarlet Pimpernel, but some of the other situations and themes of books in the Baroness's Scarlet Pimpernel series.This version of the movie is without a doubt the most enjoyable, with the 1930's one with Leslie Howard in second. Anthony Andrews is without question the perfect part of the Scarlet Pimpernel."
4,I wish this the movie was WIDESCREEN,I just got my copy today. The movie is in full screen format. The quality of the transfer is not exactly the best - it looks a lot like VHS on a high definition TV. I had to turn up the sound much more than usual. But the story is still great and very entertaining - even years after first seeing the movie on TV.
5,It's finally out on DVD!!!,"I have waited forever for this film to come to DVD. My VHS copy was getting worn out from so many repeated viewings! I saw this when it was first broadcast many years ago (I was just a youngster then) and fell in love with Anthony Andrews! He is absolutely superb as this character. No one else even comes close to his portrayal.Since then, I have watched it more times than I can count. The story is wonderful (it is a combination of several of the Scarlet Pimpernel books), the acting is superb, the locations and costumes are awe-inspiring, Jane Seymour and Ian McKellan are fantastic, and of course, Anthony Andrews steals the show! I can't say enough good about this production.Buy this DVD and find out for yourself how good it really is!"
2,"Great Movie, Horrible DVD","When the first second of the first scene shows you little cubes instead of people's heads, the walls, and the torches, you might think the DVD transfer has some problems. When not even the letters in the credits stay stable, you begin to wonder whether you wouldn't be better off buying an old VHS copy and turning it into a tiny-sized Divx file. ARRRRGH!Which breaks my heart, because this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of my all-time top ten movies. I'd be rating this with one star if the movie wasn't five-star. Too bad I can't actually see it!"
5,This is an All-Time CLASSIC!!!!,"This is one of the greatest stories ever told, and brought to life in this film. Anthony Andrews is a mondern day ""Robin Hood"", and makes you cheer/and cry for his cause. This should have more hype, and air time on classic movie channels. If you like movies such as ""The Princess Bride"", ""Count Of Monte Cristo"", and ""Pride & Predjudice"" This movie has to be part of your collection!"
5,Charming,"This movie is a favorite in my family as well. Anthony Andrews was a perfect actor to portray the character of Percy. The romance was sigh worthy and the presentation was wonderful. The musical score gave it a perfect added touch. I think this movie was very well done for its time, and enjoy it everytime I watch it. You know the actor is a good one when he can be annoyingly foppish, a passionate romantic, a dashing savior, a courageous swordsman, a comedian, and did I mention good-looking all in one movie. Anthony Andrew not only had to portray himself as Percy, but as all the characters that The Scarlet Pimpernel has to pose as to carry out his good deeds. Jane Seymore, of course, is a classic beauty. Again, not disappointing me as the heroine of a contagious story. I hope this movie comes out on DVD. It would be a shame not to."
3,scarlet pimpernel - the 80s version,"When we first received this DVD, we thought there was a mistake. However, it was the correct DVD that we ordered. It's unfortunately cheesy at the beginning, but picks up after the mid-point of the film. Our favorite Scarlet Pimpernel is still the earlier Leslie Howard version (""stickin' out like a barber pole"" vs. ""stickin' out like a pin cushion""), but Anthony Andrews tugs our heartstrings after Brideshead, and Jane Seymore always looks gorgeous. There's a thuggish guard played by the same actor who played Front de Boeuf in Ivanhoe, so that was a fun little moment, recognizing him. This is a decent version, but there are better Pimpernels."
1,Is the DVD worth buying?,"In short, NO. The show itself is WONDERFUL -- fine acting, costumes, storyline, directing etc.....but the DVD itself has NO extras. The picture quality is only marginally better than that on VHS. So if you already own the tape, you may want to consider holding off buying the DVD for the moment."
2,"Ummmmm, what to say?","I was forced to watch this movie in my French class at school, and enjoyed it to a degree, but found Percy utterly annoying. His way of speaking enrages me. In my opinion, the actors acted poorly, either that or there was a screenplay problem. You know those movies and times when you are just emberassed for the character? How you just want to yell at them and order them to do something to end the misery of other characters as well as yourself? This is one such movie."
2,Miscast,"Sadly, the wrong person was cast as the Scarlet Pimpernel, and it ruined the entire film for me. IMHO, Ian McKellan was more aptly suited to that role, and would have played it with pin-point accuracy. I thought the Pimpernel, as played by Anthony Andrews, was ridiculously unbelievable. He was too much of a fop to be taken seriously, and to label him as a ""master of disguise"" is a misnomer of vertiginous proportions. As a result, it was barely watchable. A shame, as it is certainly a wonderful story."
3,service problem,The movie was ordered July 15th and not received till Aug 8th. The movie is not as clear as it might be. Looks like its been copied too many times.
2,"Nice illustrations, Forget the stories!","The illustrations are pretty, especially the metallic silver touch!However, the stories are [weak] and simplistic (nor all original -- the ""Danced-Out Shoes"" is a variation on the well-known Twelve Dancing Princesses story).The stories have a ""silver"" theme forced on them; the morals at the end of each story also are forced, and do not depict our values. (For instance, in the first story, we think that the first sister was right to hurry home once she realized that the old woman had stolen their money.)We love beautifully illustrated fairy and folk tales -- this one does NOT make the grade."
3,Mediocre & overpriced,"I'm a lifelong collector of cookbooks. Some of my favorites are those put out by the various Junior Leagues across the country, invariably wonderful snapshots of local culture. Reflections Under the Sun, is, however, probably the single biggest disappointment that I have acquired over the years.Charleston Receiptsthis is definitely not!There is very little that is local to Phoenix, Arizona or the Southwest in Reflections. The book is chock full of restaurant recipes, seafood and goat cheese, while the true flavors of Arizona are scarce at best.Not a ""bad"" book - but certainly no star!"
3,Early R and R,"This Book is especially interesting if you were listening to the radio, as I was, in the time period described. Though, Unlike Sam Phillips, I didn't abandon the early R& B artists when Elvis came on the scene. Always felt that Elvis's music was inferior the early R& Bers. There are details, that I didn't know, of the unraveling of Jerry Lee Lewis's first career, when he married his 13 year old cousin. Also mention is made of the relationship between ""The Killer"" and Jimmy Swaggart. Interesting ancedote about how Johnny Cash came down for the Historic ""Million Dollaer quartet"" photo, then left immediately. 4 Stars is a little high for this review, but three stars would be a little low."
3,obscure Mundy,"This is a really ""out of the mainstream"" Mundy production,. not reallyrelated to his other books. It is interesting, and retains his style.It was produced as a stage play with colloboration, I gather."
3,Ok but not what expected.,I was disappointed about this game; It could have been alot better. It is a pretty good game if you pay under $10 for it. This game would be alot better if it had more levels to it. Overall it was ok; I would buy it if I was a HUGE Olsen fan.
2,A 14 year old gamer,"This game is fun, but can get frusterating. definetly not one of my favorite games. I think some of the stuff is very hard to complete and eventually give up. I only spent about 20 minutes before I turned it off. the graphics are ok, the sounds are cool"
3,Its not great but its okay,I think that this game is all right but could have been ten times better than what it was. Everything you do gets really boring but you think its great fun on your first time playing it. The graphics are all right too and I say this game is fun especially for girls aged 6-9.
3,"Good, but too easy!!","when I first played this game, I thought it was excellent but then once I had seen everything once and grasped the basic idea, I had completed it. I'm not the worlds best computer gamer and it only took me two hours to complete. It was still fun though. I think it is better for the younger age group."
2,Krappy Game,"This game shows that the Olsen's can either be really cool, or really stupid. I got this game a while ago, and have ever since hated the thing. It is sooooooo boring! The graphics are not that great, the stuff you hafta do is mostly meaningless and stupid, and it is a waste of money. If you wanna get a good gmae, do not, i repeat, do not, get this piece of junk. Get Razor scooter freestyle, it is really awesome."
4,GREAT GAME!,"THIS IS THE BEST MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY GAME OUT THERE! MY FAVE LEVEL IS MUSIC NATION WHERE YOU CAN MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO. FASH IS A VERY FUN LEVEL,ALSO. LIZZIE'S LUNCH IS VERY HARD BUT IT IS STILL FUN.JUST SAY SNOW AND CATCH A WAVE AREN'T AS FUN AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.I CAN'T GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT GETS BORING AFTER AWHILE. SO ALL I CAN SAY IS IT IS A GREAT GAME."
3,13 year old gamer,"There are five stores in the mall. You get the gem from each store (by completing a task) to break the curse. Once you get all five gems, your done. There are no bonus levels. As you collect gems the other stores of the mall open up. Too bad you can't go into them. There is an information desk in case you need help and a Bonus Boutique where you can spin the wheel to either win or lose somthing. You can win things like bonus dance moves and stuff, to make another music video if you want. Lizie's Lunch (a diner in mall) is my least favorite ""level"" you have a certain amount af time to serve everyone thier lunch. At the fashion show you can pick from a wide variety of clothing items to dress either Mary-Kate or Ashley in, and then you take pictures at the fashion show. Its not a bad game, but there are many things that could be done to improve it. It is probably better for renting. It gets old fast."
3,OK,This game is exciting for the first ten minutes. I cleared it in 2 hours. The games were too similar but the graphics were good and it is an enjoyable concept for the under 10 age group (if they are fans)!
5,Mary-Kate and Ashley Rule,"With 5 different cool levels, ways to get bonus tokens for extras in the game is cool. The gems are real important cause if you dont get them all you'll be stuck in the mall FOREVER . If you do get all you win the game and get to go home. the levels are,lizzies lunch,catch some waves,music nation, I forgot the rest but they have to do with fashion, and, snowboarding. If you get bonus tokens you can unlock like, umm.. diferent outfits, different moves in music nation, unlock new snowboards, no time limit in lizzies lunch, having 2 girls in one music movie. The ability to pick either M-K or A is sweet. I think the best level would have to be fashion. Because i always win. the bad thing is lizzies lunch because they keep leaving cause you get so many orders that you lose track. Thats all bye"
3,It's ok,"It's definately not a 4 star game but if you have little girls who worship the ground that Mary-Kate and Ashley walk on then you might want to consider this game. But I would recommend shopping around for a good price.My daughter wanted this game so desperately this past Christmas so ""Santa"" got it for her. It wasn't what she expected and she got bored with it pretty easily. It did not hold her interest at all. She's had a few friends play it as well and they got bored with it pretty quickly. It's not for everyone and you may want to consider renting before you buy to see if your child actually likes the game so you don't plunk down wasted money."
4,"Soulful, Audio Delight","I had never heard of Sara K before, but I took a chance on this recording, based on a recommendation from an audiophile friend . If you are tired of poor recorded music, with unintelligible lyrics, this is for you. Originally from Texas, Sara K has recorded a quiet, thoughtful, bluesy, acoustic album. Somewhere in the pantheon of Paula Cole, Sarah Jarosz, & Joni Mitchell - an album to be enjoyed with a glass of wine in the wee hours!"
4,Christmas Eve,"This is a Christmas movie about family. That whatever we go in life, the true meaning of Christmas is family. For fans of Loretta Yound, this film is a must for your collection. After watching this film, you may cry, but that doesn't mean your weak, it just means your human."
5,wonderful,Watching this movie is very moving. It makes you appreciate family alittle more. It is one of the best Christmas movies I've ever watched. It has my vote.
4,Excellent product,"I love this movie and couldn't find it anywhere. It's older and on VHS so it's hard to get. The only complaint is it has a different cover, but all in all it's wonderful"
5,Wacky and funny,"This movie is odd, yet I really liked it. In a way, it has a touch of Pee-Wee Herman, because a giant French version of Barbie is always flyin' around. Despite it's utter goofiness, it really deals with some recent topics. I throughly enjoyed it. I think more movies should deal with lesbanism and gays."
4,A Little More Serious Than Expected,"The movie had been reccommended to me as a comedy and I was expecting such. There certainly were comedic moments but the movie was much more than I had expected.Even the review at the top of this list is not exactly accurate.Ludovic did not wear dresses and put on lipstick because he thought one of his chromosomes was misplaced. He had been doing such long before his dream. That was an explanation he was given by his sister and then he had his dream about it. Additionally, he did not voluntarily swap his costume for the dress at the party. He was trying to ""conform"" but the tomboy girl and her friends took it from him againsr his wishes.The movie should be seen by anyone who is homophobic to see the damage they can cause to individuals and families. It was a very good movie but to me the message was not one of wonderment and childhood dreams."
3,"Lovely sets, good acting ... sad commentary","The blurb that got me to watch this movie said that it was a quirky, funny, feel-good movie about a little boy who was oblivious to others' discomfiture regarding his gender identity and cross-dressing. After curiously searching other blurbs to see if I ended it too early (it was so depressing that I turned it off halfway through) I found that the ""feel-good"" part came at the very end, after a cringe-worthy scene involving the mother and a costume.Although the movie was well-acted (the cast was terrific) and pretty to look at, it was an ultimately depressing commentary on what people do to each other. If this had been a triumphant feel-good movie, I would have given it five stars. Unfortunately the story got in the way of all the rest. Life is depressing enough without watching a slightly caricatured version of real life tragedy."
5,Highly Underrated,"Off-beat gender bender that's at times funny, at times poignant, and always entertaining. Ma Vie En Rose manages to vilify our collective ignorance without insulting our sensibilities. A truly remarkable film.*High marks for set decoration and cinematography as well as casting and direction."
4,"Sweet, harmless little film on tolerance","I've found that if you are watching French films for the language practice (I plead guilty), boring films work better than good ones that will distract you with interesting characters and situations. This does. I found myself watching the film and really rooting for this poor child, an extremely sweet and feminine little girl who is, through some cosmic glitch, trapped in a little boy's body. I was struck with the honesty of how the mother becomes furious at the child who is, she feels, screwing up her neat, conventional life. The child's pain is heart-breaking, but the film ends on an upbeat note. I could have done with fewer visual fantasy sequences."
1,"Uh, no. This is a nightmare!","Uhm, this film is pretty much everything wrong with society. A seven year old boy dresses up in a skirt and wants to marry the boy next door. Did Michael Jackson produce this piece of garbage?"
5,A Beautiful Film,"Berliner captured the innocence of a child and displayed it on film for the world to see. Anyone who has or ever plans to have children should see this film to truly understand where our children are coming from.. a fantastical world where they are accepted and loved, no matter who they are. Berliner exceeds the expectations of the audience and displays the world through a child's eye."
3,Something to be read if you're interested in sociology,"If you know a little about general stuff, you'll know who's Giddens. He's not a newbie on the sociology scene. Moreover, he's one of Tony Blair's advisors (consultants). I think this book takes the Third way in a serious way, and that it's the Third Way in itself. Read it if you are interested in the subject, if not, do it anyway, you'll be interested after reading..."
5,Great Bilingual Books!,I have Eating in bilingual versions of Chinese and Arabic. Thank god someone is putting out books for bilingual children. Learning literacy in the native language and in English increases comprehension and makes it easier for children to read. Terrific! It's a very nice book for emergent readers whose native language is English too!
4,"For the right situation, it's perfect.","My husband's mother lives in a retirement community. While there is a full kitchen, space is exceedingly limited. This and its companion piece are perfect for air-drying the few things that won't fit into the half-size dishwasher or that shouldn't be washed there. The clear version, which we bought, makes it less prominent visually. Overally, she is very satisfied. Perhaps the manufacturer will address the size issue by making a larger one and labelling this one the ""compact"" version."
2,Warlock III: The End of Innocence,"Oh, look mom, another Scream style movie. Unlike the first two Warlock movies that actually had original and decent stories, this one just copies the current trend of unoriginal story. Kids go to old house, strange man shows up, strange man is evil, kids are stupid, strange evil man kills them in weird and exotic ways, one person lives to defeat strange man, and live happily ever after. The only thing good about this was Bruce Payne, he plays a real excellent bad guy. Other than that this movie was not really worth the [amount of money] I paid for it."
4,I'd recommend it!,"Okay, firstly I'm a huge Julian Sands fan and admit I was a little disappointed that he wasn't in the third installment of the Warlock series.It's of course your run of the mill horror flick. HOWEVER, I will say that I really enjoyed this movie with Bruce Payne as the warlock. Sands having a maleviolent air about him, you knew immediately that he was the villian of the movie. But in #3 Payne seemed much more beneviolent. I liked that he intentionally portrayed his charactor awkward and out of place as he would for warlock trapped within his own house for 350 years lacking human contact. He seemed innocient and likeable. Also, I especially enjoyed the individual dialoge he had speaking with each one of the charactors as he methodically tricked them into handing over their friend for the sacrifice.I haven't seen Bruce Payne in a lot of films, but he's a good actor and it's a shame he's not in more mainstream movies. He shines under thick clouds and I'd really like to see more of him."
2,C Movie,"If you have seen the first two movies. You can stop there. This one is a C at best. Okay if their is nothing else on t.v., and if you have already watched your entire DVD collection. I bought it to complete the set.When I sat down to watch it. I was surprised. I thought that I had the wrong DVD. Quality is not even close to the previous two."
5,loved it,"I don't care what others think of the third Warlock movie, I loved it. It had the action of the first 2 movies and all the suspense of them as well. Though I did miss seeing Julian Sands in the part of the Warlock. I think he was great in the first 2 and with him playing the warlock, I had chills going down my spine"
1,Bruce Payne is squashed and Warlock 3 is a dud,"Hottie Ashley Laurence (Hellraiser, Lightning Bug) and her friends stay at this old building which is supposed to be of historical significance. While at this shindig, Warlock Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons 1 and 2) arrives convincing everyone that he is an archtect and so on and so forth. Then a storm hits, so Payne stays with the gang threwout the night...some thing he's cool, some think he's just a freak and some think that's he's not who he says he is. Soon, Payne unleashes his wrath, killing the friends off one by one to get to the prize, which is Laurence and he's supposed to sacrifice her for something. I was only interested in this for Bruce Payne, Ashley Laurence and Soap Opera star Rick Hearst (Carpool Guy, Tv's General Hospital). Also starring Angel Boris (Intercepter Force) and Boti Ann Bliss (National Lampoon's Dorm Daze). Another crappy horror sequel to put on the pile."
4,not really a wark number 3 but still very good,if you liked warlock 1 and 2 you should like 3 its with diffrent people and its very diffrent hard really to say its more like a warlock 1 or a movie that should not be as a part
3,"Donkey Kong- Fun, While it lasts","Donkey Kong, for the GBA ereader, is a nintendo classic that is let down by one flaw- it's all over too quickly. With only 3 levels to play on, the gaming experience is a fun, if fast one.Still, for its price, the game is value for money, and is one of those games you can come back to for a quick fix. The only problem is that it probably takes more time to scan the cards in then to play the whole game itself!"
4,phat beats and cool packaging!,"This is a killer compilation - filled with heavy bass lines, moody samples, and dub/r n b/influenced jungle vibes. Not quite as good as ""Breakbeat Massive"" in my opinion - start with that one, and if you dig it, get this one. And sweet ""Altoids""-style tin box packaging to boot! Mutant Records rulez the wasteland!!!"
3,For future reference,"I have a terminal illness, and am always looking for information about suicide JUST IN CASE. This is a very interesting compilation of articles and studies about assisted suicide, and I recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in the topic."
1,This robot stinks,"We ordered this boe bot after my son used a version in a robots class he took. The instructions did not correspond well with the bot at all, and we had to play ""guess what to do next"" for most of the programming. The worst part was the bot itself. We had to reorder a new ""stamp"" - the part that actually makes the bot work, as the one they sent was broken, and this was after spending a WEEK with customer service trying to figure out what is wrong. THEN, once we got the new stamp, one of the gears on the wheel broke, so it couldn't move! At this point we figured we got a piece of junk, so we put all the pieces back in the box and sent it back. Now they will not refund the money as they say we didn't include all the parts! This company is crap, and their product is crap. Stick with Lego robotics instead."
3,Don't use liquids,"I tried every combination of sugar water, colored sugar water, colored water I could find to attract wasps. They were all around my yard, but none in the trap. I finally caught wasps when I replaced the liquid with salmon. Uncertain if other meats would work, I own three so next summer they will all have meat and I'll see how it goes."
1,Save your money,"My home is the perfect setting to attract many verity ofBees wash and yellow jackets. The formula and placement of the traps is simple and I change it out 4 times over a 3 month period. All I caught in the trap was a couple of mosquitoes.You will see this same review for another trap I bought, different model same results.Save your money."
2,A good story but too many flaws,"I've been a Steve Perry fan since The Man Who Never Missed, so my disappointment with this book bordered on disgust.I hope a print version of this book is better written than the electronic version since the story was entertaining. When I read, I really ""get into"" a good book. Just as I'd become immersed in the story, a stray ampersand, check mark, or random letter would appear, right in the middle of a word. Unfortunately, this was not a rare problem. It was like loud, screeching, speaker feedback happening every 15 seconds while listening to a great, four-minute song. The momentum was lost and was difficult to get back.Beside the typographical errors, a glaring mistake where one character's name was used in place of another may slap you between the eyes."
2,Not a good product,"Well it's a good thing that I had a gift certificate for this item and thus didn't have to pay too much money. The headphones broke (one ear piece stopped working) fairly soon after I got it, which is typical with Aiwa and Sony. Finally, it no longer plays tapes but just the radio. Hmm I think I've had it for a year and a half??"
4,Works fine for me,This player has worked through workouts and trips and continues to play just fine.
4,Good Value,"I am very pleased with this unit. I have tried 3 other casettes players for running and have found that they all skip. This one has worked without skipping whether running, walking, holding the player, or having it hooked to my waist. The headphones could be a bit more comfortable and the sound isn't perfect, but for me and my 2-3 mile runs, it is a keeper!"
5,Very good overview.,"First, this is a DVD of a guy standing in front of a white board doing math problems. It is not going to be the most exciting thing on earth, and depending on how you learn, may or may not be for you. Second, as the instructor says, he does not cover every topic one is likely to encounter in a specific class. He covers what he thinks the ""main"" points are. Third, the instructor presumes that you have a foundation in certain topics, so he does not go into great detail on the basics you need to solve the problems on this particular DVD.With that said, as a person who has not taken a math class in over 10 years, and am returning to school to take some math and science classes, this is as the title says a great overview. Each chapter on the DVD builds upon the previous one, and the instructor provides many examples of how to work through the problems. It is most definitely meant to be a supplement to class and the textbook, not a replacement for either."
2,"Very basic, skills oriented without promoting understanding","If what you are looking for is a review of the most basic of Algebra 2 skills, then this video may help you. But compared to what is covered these days in Algebra 2 courses, this video course is of little use. He does not show you how to use a graphing calculator and although he explains things like solving linear equations in a slow easy to follow manner, there is little advanced math or understanding being promoted."
5,What a great price for awesome content!,Fantastic value! I've really learned a lot from this 2-DVD set!
5,Should be required for every class.,Excellent tool to increase your understanding. I used it every day in class. Just great.
3,Great Content/ Horrible Quality.,I am a big fan of the Math Tutor DVD series. I have learned so much from this series and I am far better off in math than I was before I ever picked up this series. My main complaint with this DVD however isn't the content. You do learn alot about algebra 2 and it will sharpen your skills. However the main problem with this series is that it was thrown together and in horrible quality. The camera sounds exactly like a swarm of bees flying around in the room. I'm being stark serious buzzing and just constant interference make this DVD almost a nightmare to watch. The sound does not improve at all and is constantly a distraction. I have actually ended some of the segments before they were completed just because I could not stand to deal with the noise any longer. His Algebra 1 series was very solid vol 1 and 2 were done with great precision but this series leaves alot to be desired.
4,good stuff,the teacher is very good. the board is somewhat more confined than in subsequent DVDs in the series. i think he makes the occasional minor slip on the board--he should have admitted it in front of the camera and cleared it away at once. the DVD would have become much more useful if some computer graphics had been used--for example when plotting functions. finally the box in which the DVDs are contained is very practical
3,Helpful but boring.,"This DVD is not very good quality because so much is crammed onto such little space but it works well enough, I suppose. The recording is a close up of a dry-erase board upon which a man writes examples and equations while explaining them. It's much like a boring classroom lecture... but the benefit of the DVD is obviously that you can review it as often as needed. I can only stand to watch about a half and hour or so at a time as it's rather dry... but I have learned from it."
5,"Grades went from a ""C"" to ""A-"" in algebra 2",I was never very good in algebra until I found this DVD. The teacher takes things step by step and doesn't assume that you already know the material. It sounds funny but other DVDs that I have do things so fast that it seems like they think you already know the stuff. If I knew it already I wouldn't buy a DVD! This DVD is great!
2,Graphics or motion problems galore,"Some of the courses on the PC game work great and are a lot of fun. Other courses, such as Bethpage, Pumpkin Ridge, Kapalua, do not work properly. The motion of the graphics is segmented so that timing becomes almost an impossible challenge. Not on every shot, but enuff to ruin a score on the hole and with a few problem shots on different holes, the round. The 2005 game does not have this problem and its graphics are far superior in any event. Really hope that this problem is corrected for the PC game in '07."
1,Did EA Sports Outsource '06?,"I own Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 and 2005 which are both awesome. When I got 2006 for my birthday I thought EA Sports decided to outsource their programming and UI to a foreign country with cheaper labor. The game loads slower and doesn't allow for skipping animations like '04 and '05. The putting is confusing, the Pro Shop UI is disturbingly unfriendly, and the overall game play experience is a vast disappointment from its predecessors. This game should be renamed Tiger Woods PGA Tour 1986 and be available exclusively for Atari."
2,Big disappointment on Tiger Woods PGA 06,"Well I cannot speak for everyone but here is the bottom line after I have played the game.After playing 05 I thought 06 would have a lot more to offer but wow, how I was wrong. You have almost no control over the ball off the tea and about the same all the way down the fairway. You can not change your position before driving the ball and trying to build power at the same time is impossible, most of the guess work on the green is now gone it seems and the new voice overs "" well they seem annoying "". They made room for players voices and took away from game play I my self rather have the game play. Any hoot, 05 is a much better game all around, 06 does have some better graphics but creating a player is just not the same.I feel 06 would have been better if they would have left the game setup like 05 and just added in some of the new 06 features.If you want to have control on the ball and have more fun all around play 05Thank you, for reading"
3,A sidestep from greatness for TWG,"This game is really frustrating. They messed up the putting with the dual stick putting mode. It's hard to explain, but it has become very difficult."
4,Very Good TWPGA,I do very much like this game. It has a great UI (user interface) and is a lot of fun. Not much else I can say.
4,"Good, but......",My husband hasn't had a lot of time to play this game yet. He said it's much different from the '04 and '05 versions he likes.
2,NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE FOR 360,"I bought this game thinking it was backward compatible with the 360 but it wasn't mainly my fault for not checking on XBOX's Website, so i have the game but haven't been able to play it. I gave it 5 stars cause i know it's a fun game, but 2 stars because a great game like this should be backward compatible."
5,Incredible,"This game has renewed my interest in fighting games. The online experience is incredible. I've played people from Japan and France with no noticable lag. Maybe 10% of games have the occasional 1 or 2 sec hiccup, but other than that it plays like they are sitting in the room next to you. The only fault I can find is the sprites are low resolution, but I have so much fun playing I don't notice. Hopefully not too many people pass this game by because of the outdated graphics."
2,Eh.,This came later than it should. In fact 5 days late. The cd cover is all messed up when I got it and the cd has a lot of scratches. Wrong condition. Not Good.
4,WAY BETTER THAT THE PS2 ONE FOR GOOD REASONS,"THIS IS WAY BETTER FOR GOOD REASONS.1.THE X-BOX CONTROL SETUP IS SWEET CONCIDERING THE GROOVE SETUP.2.ONLINE:NEED I SAY MORE.3.YOU CAN TALK TRASH DURING THE ONSLUGHT!!!4.VISIONALLY A WORK OF ART,A MAJOR STEPUP FORM OYHER SYSTEMS.ENJOY!!!"
5,REA has overprepared me for every CLEP I've taken,"I am not new to taking CLEP tests. I have taken Humanities, Sociology, Marketing and Management. I've used REA each time, and each time I have passed with high scores. For the lit test, I didn't spend that much time with my REA book. I refreshed my knowledge of literary terms and devices and I did a few passages for fun. I took it this morning and scored a 77. The actual test was easier than the practice tests that are in the REA book, but that's what I like about REA."
5,REA does it again!,"I am a CLEP maniac and always use the books from REA. I studied for 6 weeks and passed the exam. The tests in the back were perfect for preparation. I strongly recommend anybody taking CLEP exams to buy only the books from REA, they clearly are the leaders. Don't delay, buy the book and CLEP today!"
4,Piece of Cake!,"I read through the review section on Saturday, took one practice test and scored a 69, read over the literary terms again on Sunday for about 20 minutes and decided to wing it from there. I scored a 77 on the CLEP the next morning! There are many more literary terms in the study guide than you'll need for the exam - just the basics will do. The review section on poetry was intimidating, but none of that info was on the exam. The review section is clearly written by someone who loves to teach about literature, and is more concerned with educating us than with just making sure we pass the test, but it's short enough so just bear through it."
4,CLEP Analyzing & Interpeting Literature,"This text helped me past the exam. I could not have done it without this book. I read the book on and off for 4 weeks, refreshing my high school++ knowledge. I took the three exams and was at the just passing grade. When taking the test, I suggest that you move quickly through the test, marking those which you are not sure of; then, leave time to go back over those questions you have marked for review. Good luck!"
2,Just concentrate on the practice tests,"Whoever wrote the Literature Review chapter should have read the review book for Freshman College Composition first. There were a number of incomplete sentences, several run-on sentences, and a few grammatical errors. The tone of that chapter is a little pompous and condescending, too. It was not what I expected from a review book.My advice is to concentrate on the practice tests and the detailed explanations of the answers and you'll do fine."
3,Good Study Guide....But a Little Overwhelming,"I recently took this CLEP test using this book as the only means of my study. Unfortunately, I procrastinated and didn't follow the suggested study schedule in this book and only started studying three days in advance. With that in mind, this book is a decent review for the literary terms that you need to brush up on. Also, there are some great examples of all the different types of literature found on the exam. However, the tests included in this book are tough...I didn't pass them. However, when I took the actual test, I passed with a respectable 61. The moral: don't fret too much if you don't do well on the practice test which takes up a large part of this book. If you study with this book, take it with a grain of salt, and don't rely solely on the tests provided with this guide."
4,Worked like a charm!,"I bought this book about three weeks before I was to take my exam. I studied the book on and off for two of those weeks and passed with a 65. I have to agree with the reviewers who state that the practice questions in the book are harder than the actual CLEP itself. However, the greatest difference between the actual test and the practice tests is the lack of ambiguity in the possible answers. My one complaint with the REA book is that on many of the questions more than one answer could be correct. This is not the case on the actual CLEP test. Don't worry if you dont ace the practice tests... if you can score a 40 or above you should have a great chance of passing the real thing!"
2,not as helpful,not as hepful as I thought it would be to prepare my daughter. wasn't her type of learning style
2,Let me be the lone dissenter here!,"This book is not worthless, but there are bettter prep helps available.The intro coaching material is unduely verbose. The intro and glossary of any Lit Anthology will be more concise, literate, and elevating. The sample tests here are uneven. On the one hand, Practice Test 3's questions 66-60 quite nicely test one's grasp of basic literary terms applied to Shakespeare's Sonnets; on the other, the next section's prose reading passage contains enough ambiguity (Qs 70, 71, and 74), that I'm not sure what one is learning! The answers are just too debatable to make an effective prep tool.MUCH more concise in prepping and testing for this CLEP is the second half of Princeton Review's Cracking the SAT II: English.Only the multiple choice test length is different, making this a far better learning tool and investment of your precious time."
4,"not enough detail, no maintenance covered","I own a 2130 JD and it has a slow/weak hydraulic system. Needing to clean the filter and pump intakes, I ordered this book for the detail that I would need to do the job correctly. It was not there. It only covers repairs, not any maintenance job details. But, it was worth it to have for future repairs. Well worth the price to any JD owner who needs to do own repairs."
1,This is not a factory shop manual. It is almost useless.,"I own numerous factory shop manuals for motorcycle, ATV and pickup truck. These manuals have comprehensive diagrams and instructions. I appreciate brevity, however this manual covers so many models, in such a broad way that there is little information that is useful. I suppose that if you are a tractor mechanic who works on this model frequently and you want a quick glance at the basics it might be useful."
1,Total Ripoff,"Just bought one of these ""I&T; Shop Manuals"" for a John Deere 870.The thing is about 1/8th of an inch thick.It's not a shop manual. It barely qualifies as a ""Pamphlet"".Steer clear of the I&T; stuff!"
5,Very good item,"Has been a real life saver very good details would not hurt if it was printed in larger print, and the illistrations were larger."
2,The New Jerusalem,"""The New Jerusalem"" is essentially a journal. It's written in the style of a journal, documenting the rambling thoughts and emotions of its author on his travels through Jerusalem. It's hard to read this kind of rambling wandering.I know that scholars find interesting facts in any kind of writing and there may be some here. I'm not in that kind of scholarly position and do not recommend it for the general reader."
4,excellent modern boogie woogie selection,"If you're looking for a more recent selection of boogie woogie selections, this is your disc. All the tracks are upbeat and jumping. It just makes you want to get up and move."
2,BLUE 88'S BOOGIE WOOGIE INSTRUMENTS,"I couldn't find a way to listen to samples, so I took a chance and bought the cd because I wanted a boogie woogie piano cd. I didn't like the cd at all. I will not buy another cd without hearing a sample unless I know for sure what's on it."
2,I got the blues cause. . .,I was disappointed with this cd. I didn't like the frenetic pace of the selections and felt that at least two of the selections were sloppily done. Have always like the boogie woogie I have heard and was surprised and let down with these pieces.
5,Classic WWE PPV review consisting of what I'm gonna do the night of the PPV.,"In keeping with the tradition of the average WWE PPV review on Amazon I am going to be the first to write something for this PPV that really has nothing to do with it. So here goes.I don't know if this PPV is going to be any good, because maybe it will and maybe it won't. Either way I might order it; then again maybe I won't. It's hard to tell really, because I don't know if it would turn out to be worth it in the end."
5,Newgarden Fans Can Now Die (Alone) Happily!,"A flocked collection of the great works and influences of the most important visual cultural satirist of our time. This is the book Newgarden fans have been waiting for (since most Newgarden fans have been personally contacted by Mark himself to tell them that this book was on it's way). And for those philistines who've never heard of Mark Newgarden, I can only say, run, don't walk to the ""add to shopping cart"" button, for this book will change your life. Or at least point out why Ernie Bushmiller's ""Nancy"" was funny in a way it was never intended to be.Designed to manic perfection by Helene Silverman and thoughtfully edited by some guy named Dan, it's an amazing collection of Newgarden's cartoons, Topp's work and personal detritus that paint a portrait of an artist whose work is impossible to classify, yet impossible to resist.And did I mention that the book's cover is flocked?"
5,'bout time!,"Showtime had ""Queer As Folk"" on for about five years before Noah's Arc.It was about time to put some chocolate rainbow boys on TV. The first few episodes were kinda trite. But, improvements have been made in character development. Not much else can be said for Black gay men in ""LA LA"" land.Just fun to watch and not to be taken seriously."
4,Good Flavor - Moderate Heat,"I purchased this for my boyfriend who likes hot sauces and spice. He liked this and thought it had a nice flavor, not too much vinegar flavor. I was looking for something different from Tobasco and this fit the bill.However, my boyfriend said it was not very hot.He has a fairly good spice tolerance. For example, he asks for Thai and Indian food Hot, I ask for it Mild. I tried some sauce straight and thought it was hot but I have a much lower tolerance. Keep this in mind that if you like things blazing hot (Indian and Thai food made for the locals) it will probably be medium for you. If you eat things mild to medium, it will be hot."
3,"great sauce, but product image is misleading","i bought this two-pack as well as the significantly cheaper (per gram)Nando's Extra Hot Peri Peri Sauce, 4.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6). i wanted to compare how this ""Traditional"" extra hot style compares to the regular one. instead, the two-pack i received contained two of the same bottles as were in the six-pack.don't get me wrong--this sauce is amazing! it's tangy, slightly hot, and generally just delicious. i do wish it was actually ""extra hot"" as its name claims, but it's easy enough to add some ghost pepper sauce or fresh ground chili to get the full effect.but the whole reason i bothered with this two-pack is because it was labeled as ""Traditional"" in the product image and i wanted to compare it to the other kind. since it turns out to be exactly the same, this was a waste of money."
4,H15 1500VA Review,I love the look and quality of this product. I never knew how much the power fluctuated untill I had this installed. I always see it doing the line trim or fixing a voltage sag and I personally believe this extends the life of your equipment. I have not had any major surges where it tripped the breaker on the back yet but it works well otherwise.The only negative thing I can think about is that you hear an audible clicking sound when it trims or boosts the voltage.. which can get annoying if it does it alot.
4,Good Value for the Money,"This a good alternative to the higher priced brands such as Panamax.I figured with APC's tremendious amount of experience in producing surge protection the company would make a decent product. When the product arrived I removed the cover and took a detailed picture of the interior components and sent it to a power supply engineer friend who worked for NASA and asked for his opinion. He advised that the components were impressive for a consumer product and would more that do the job. I wasn't thrilled with the silver color but otherwise it's doing the job - enough to protect from surges, filter noise, and stabilize current, but not get ripped off with an over-priced unnecessary home theater gizmo."
5,Well Designed Book!,"I had to get this book for a Marketing class I had to take. The design of the book was awesome! I really enjoyed the Chapter video cases that provided current examples of the marketing concepts covered. The ""marketing dictionary"" section in the lower right hand corners made studying a breeze. Not only do the authors give examples of the marketing concepts and strategies with current examples, they also provide the ""Marketing Miss"" section, which points out real marketing problems, their outcomes and lessons learned. There is also a ""'net Work"" section in each chapter, where you can go only line and research marketing data! I enjoyed reading this book, so getting through two chapters a week wasn't a grind (unlike my management book... but that's another story)."
4,Gauntlet Clone,"This game is very similar to Gauntlet Dark Legacy. The graphics are better in ""Stones"" but the weaponry and the game organization is better in ""Legacy"". I have played ""Legacy"" through several times an enjoyed it much. To early in this game to see if I stay with it. Prima has yet to produce any assistance for Blackstones either."
4,HAPPY COSTUMER,"This game wasn't what I expected. It is like gauntlet and I was expecting something a tad different. But over all I am happy because the game works and me and my friends can play it. :) I would buy from this seller again, just review the games a bit more before I buy them. But that wasn't the seller's fault."
1,Garbage,"Creo Que Shakira Esta muerta en Vida, Shakira es Una Guisa si piensa vender esto que es una reverenda porqueria, prefiero comprar la porqueria de thalia greates hits,pero para que peder dinero si exite Pau-Latina."
1,Two thumps down.,"Shakira and her producers don't know what to do to make money. That's the only thing I can think after checking this production.Her 2003 tour was good. I saw her in Lima and I found the concert interesting, she sang several songs and had a good production. But This is cd is simply garbage (excuse me Shakira fans but it's true) from the 17 songs that she sang on her concerts she only adds 10 and let's not forget that ""Ojos asi"", ""Ciega, sordomuda"", ""Si te vas"" and ""Tu"" sound the same way that they sound on her Unplugged cd.There's only one new song which is ""Back in black"" but I wonder where are her other hits like ""Estoy aqui"" or ""Donde estas corazon?"".If you want to buy this cd just do it for the DVD because the cd is simply trash. And besides, the DVD doesn't contain the whole show.I used to be a Shakira fan when she released her cd ""Pies descalzos"" and found ""Donde estan los ladrones?"" interesting but after that I can just say that Shakira isn't the same artist."

1,Pau-Latina The Best Latin Album Of 2004,"Jaajaja perdom por que shakira es una estupida que canta como las cabras. jajajajajaja, ojala en el siguiente Cd que saque le vaya como a losmperros en MISA."
2,Singing needs Coaching!,"Beautiful woman, OK belly dancer, nice blonde hair, but her singing is just awful in ""Live Off The Record."" Even when she speaks to the audience it's really bad. She's great marketing hype, but honestly, her singing has really declined rapidly. I like her band which makes up for her weak singing. Check our her first two albums when Shakira was more serious and relied less on dying her hair, less belly dancing, and more writing substance. No wonder sellers are selling this CD+DVD album under $3."
5,Shakira Shakira Shakira Shakira,this cd&dvd combo.willrock your world Shakira is the best thing to hit the latin mucic in a jillion years ...you will be be sorry you bought this package .....HIPS DONT LIE....
3,Live,"This is an older CD. My son wanted it, and he loves it all becasue of Hips Don't Lie! So if you are die hard fan, this is a must!"
4,"Nice CD, Rare DVD and a must for Shakira fans....","IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SUCCESS IN A LIVE ALBUM LISTEN JUDY GARLAND AT CARNEGIE HALL (1961). SHE WAS A REAL REAL SINGER. SORRY FOR YOU BECAUSE I USED TO BE YOUR ADMIRER. YOUR SHOW IN MARACAIBO, VENEZUELA WAS AWFUL, GOODLUCK NEXT TIME .....In a second view of the DVD I can tell that the concert is wonderfull the problem was the concert in my city. Anyway the friend I was with in the concert told my something marvelous about the concert in my city: ""I know the concert was awful because the sound but the importand was that Shakira was there....and the is all right, Shakira is a star now..."
1,Shakira es Una perra Perdedora !,"Soy Una Colombiana Radicada en EE.UU., Odio a Shakira porque ya se cree Gringa es una Engreida, ojala fuera Paulina Colombiana, Pero lastima solo es Orgullo Mexicano, Pero me siento orgullosa de ellaporque es LATINA; al igual que Alejandra Guzman, Mueran las Latinas que se Creen Gringas (ThALIA, sHAKIRA)."
1,Garbage GARBAGE Garbage GARBAGE,"I'm Sorry Fans De Shakira, esta Tipa En Que Piensa esta loca si piensa vender esta cosa, no se pero el que compre esto debe estar de verdad loco o en verdad en un fan de esta."
1,Very bad.,"I can only say that this girl is very talented but she doesn't work in the right way. Her Mtv Unplugged was terrible, adding only the songs of her album ""Donde estan los ladrones?"" and her song ""Estoy aqui"" but she didn't sing many of her hits or sang cover and now this cd that doesn't contain the whole show.I can only say z-, TERRIBLE."
1,Es un robo.,"Que lastima, solo puedo decir que siento que me han robado. Compre este disco el dia que salio al mercado sin ver las canciones que contenian porque pense que escucharia todo el show pero me di con la sorpresa que solo contiene 3 canciones.El dvd tambien esta cortado.Solo puedo decir que es una estafa.Lo siento fans de Shakira, se que ahora me van a poner muchos votos negativos pero eso no cambia que este disco sea una m*e*d*."
1,I'm Sorry,Que Lastima Shakira que te hayas vuelto asi pero no importa tu exito no es del que dura para toda la vida jajaja me da risa porque esta chica ya se cree no se pero espero de que baje de la nube pronto.
1,How Sad !,"For a Woman who is brillant on stage, this album is so bad and doesnt capture his magic, perhaps Sony wanted some qucik money, they should of thought twice. His voice sounds like it was dubbed in, the crowd doesnt sound like a live crowd, its all very strange.Live albums are really for fans, but I think most fans wont likethis effort, perhaps on his next tour he cant release another live album that will show people the real Shakira in concert."
2,DX should NOT be on this DVD,"I would buy this, except DX is on the cover. I'm sorry, but not happening, DX doesn't belong there."
2,What Happened the WWF has all the wrestling libraies and this is the best they can do?,"Horendous thats all i can say,Here is a company that owns 90 percent of the wrestling federations libraies and this is all they can give.What happened to The Valiant Brothers,what happened to Chief Jay Strongbow and Sonny King,what happened to King Curtis and Baron Sicluna,Tarzan Tyler and Crazy Luke Graham,how about the florida tag team slike paksang and Joe leduc,The hollywood blondes featuring a pre freebird Buddy jack roberts.And by the way Vince mcmahon what happened to the release of the Three Shea Stadium Cards,This is why The WWF attendance is down and tv rating down.."
2,WWE Allied Powers,"Tag team wrestling is dead in WWE, so why would they bother to release a half-baked dvd set over it? The biggest tag teams of the last twenty years are all with TNA now including Kevin Nash, Booker T, Dudley Boys, New Age Outlaws, and Scott Steiner. I look at the match listing and there may be a few matches worth checking out but i'll wait to get a used copy. Triple H and HBK shouldnt be on the cover, just anther reason why WWE just doesnt get fans anymore. They might as well put Bushwhackers on the cover. Miz and Morrison host and i'm sure it can get pretty annoying to watch. It's easy to be called the greatest tag team in WWE as they claim when there is no competetion around."
2,What!?! No A.P.A,"Some of this looks really good but no A.P.A. is a crime. No Hulk and Macho. No Stone Cold and who ever he was stuck with. No strong personality teamed with equally strong personallity. Still, no A.P.A.? Could have been worth it but...."
3,Miz & Morrison? Really?,"Seriously? These 2 idiots hosting a DVD people have been waiting years for? Guess I'll be skipping their stupid antics and just hoping the profile of the teams is decent. Some of the matches look good, but the Road Warriors vs. Money Inc. is silly. There are about 200 matches the LOD have done better.And where are the Russians? Tony Atlas & Rocky Johnson? Valentine & Beefcake? All of these teams did more than Haas & Benjamin and Los Guerroosoros (or whatever they called themselves)...Just my 2 cents..."
3,OK set,"This dvd set has some pretty good matches on it. They really don't go into very much detail on the tag teams featured on this dvd set. To me the dvd feel out of date because it is hosted by Miz and Morrison back when they were together as a team I guess. I feel it could of featured alot more tag teams and more matches from WCW, Vince owns all the old footage and this is the best they could give us, what a shame."
5,This is it! Eric Jerardi is one bad man!,I first saw Eric Jerardi on the cover of Blues Matters- a magazine in England....Naturally- I can't see him in the USA- so when this DVD came out- I ordered it. Eric- you are one bad mother on the guitar- this DVD has not come out of the player in 2 weeks now! Great songs- I love the new ones....and seeing your guitar set-up in the extra scenes- I could not believe you walked us through how you get your amazing tone. If your a guitar geek or just want to see someone who has the chops- buy this DVD! I'm a bigger fan of EJB after this!!!
2,"ARNE, RON UPDATE THIS BOOK!","This was a GREAT book - back in 1990. It's now badly out of date. It tells you all about photometers of 20 years ago that used photo-electric tubes or pulse counters, but says nothing about what people use today for photometry (CCD cameras). The technology described in this book is ancient considering the major advancements that have been made since 1990. For example, it tells you to make sure you use a computer that has 20MB of DASD! This book is badly in need of an update.Nevertheless, there are aspects of photometry that have not changed in 20 years and for those aspects this is still one of the best books out there. But often it's hard to know whether the procedures and techniques they describe are dependent on the old technology and now you should use new procedures with CCD equipment, or whether the procedures and techniques still apply. So it's very difficult trying to sort out what is still relevant vs. what is ancient history."
4,For professionals?,This book seems to be written for advanced amateurs with a quite professional equipment. It's also a good starting for the young astronomer.
1,PAPER WEIGHT,"This printer is little more than a paper weight. The money you save by having a printer/scanner combo, you spend in paper and ink cartridges. I can honestly say this because there isn't a time when it will not get jammed and continue using ink, even when the paper isn't feeding properly. So the next sheet or two of paper you run through your printer will come out with excess ink all over it. It is also very frustating, that it has trouble feeding paper, it either refuses to take any paper, or instead of just 1 sheet it will feed as many as 5 at once and cause the printer to jam."
2,You can better,"The Lexmark X75 burns through ink. Worse, it is a cheaply manufactured product that breaks down after about two years of use. Specifically, it starts feeding multiple pages at once. The color functionality stopped working. Finally, if you own a Mac steer clear. Lexmark does not update the drivers and therefore you lose the diagnostics tools."
3,Okay but...,"This printer is okay, but is difficult to install without the Installation CD with Drivers that come with the system in its original package. I have been fighting with my computer for over a week, and still cannot install the Printer to my printers..Such a hassle. If you purchase this product, DO NOT lose the installation CD.Ant"
2,Boo!,"Initially, this printer worked OK for scanning some friend's photos and printing out on photo paper for some cute little frames around the house. After a short time, however, this thing became more of a headache that it was worth. The paper is constantly jamming, tearing, crumping... you name it. The ink cartridges always need cleaning (which takes up a LOT of ink), and the quality quickly and obviously declines when choosing NORMAL over BETTER or BEST quality printing. It's become too costly to upkeep, so we decided to get a HP laser printer instead for the mostly document-type printing we do, and have been pleased with the switch. We still keep it around for scanning purposes, but that's about it."
1,worst printer,i bought this printer for $50 at best buy. i thought i was getting the bargain of a lifetime for a printer/scanner/copier. i worked great at the begining the only drawback was expensive ink cartridges. eventually it stopped working and there was an entire slew of problems. over all this printer sucks dont buy it.
4,Apple .Mac,I think this is a great idea. The only bad thing is I can't figure out the photocasting. It doesn't work for me.
4,Good services... except website hosting.,"I've been a mac lover for years, and while the website creation, uploading, backup software, email, iDisk, and support services are all top-notch and Very easy to use... my one squall would be the URL of the website they give you for hosting. It is a very long URL, and can be confusing for some people. Such length is horrible if you want to remember it and give it to a friend to write down so they can check out your site. If you are not using .Mac 4.0 for your own website hosting, you cannot beat the deal. However, if you are planning on having your own website as the primary reason for buying .Mac, you would be far better off with GeoCities or some other hosting. For other tips on Mac products (I have been a professional Mac user for 4 years) please email me at topaz3in6@mac.com"
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"In theory this is a great service, HOWEVER - if you're seeking this for syncing, then be prepared for unreliability and quite simply lack of functionality. Many, many people have experienced problems syncing for weeks now. For me personally this feature simply does not work. I have 3 Macs and tried every suggestion out there. If you don't believe me, go to the .Mac forums and see how this is affecting people. Apple is doing little to resolve this; in fact the latest OSX update only made these problems worse. The status officially still claims to be ""online and operational""; VERY misleading!"
1,.Mac disappoints,"I purchased this service for one primary purpose - to transfer a large (21MB) Quickbooks file to my accountant. I could use the other storage features, but this is what I bought it for. Well, it doesn't work. Every time I try to upload the file, it freezes, even though I am using a brand new (less than one month old) quad core pro Mac. There is no phone tech support and the email support is slow (they do NOT respond within the advertised 24hrs). and inadequate. I would like to get a refund but there is no way to get a human being on the phone.I have used Mac products for 20 years (I learned on the Lisa, the precursor to the Mac). My business and home run on Macs. This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Apple.DON""T BUY!!!!"
3,"Good, but needs work!","There's lots to like with the .mac service, unfortunately, the price is not one of them. I use the sync, mail, tutorials and iDisk mostly. These services seem to function well (mail does seem to be down more than any other mail service I use), but there are other FREE services that are as good or better, but it's the .Mac integration with OS 10 that makes it so nice to use. Even with the Amazon price however, it is still too costly for what is offered. Hopefully Apple will be adding features to .Mac in the near future!"
5,Apple .Mac 4.0 Online Sevicee,I am renewing my .Mac account. And the price is $20 cheaper than if I renewed with Apple.Great Product!
3,.Mac 4.0 Online needs a speed upgrade.,I like this product yet it certainly isn't for industrial use. It takes a bit too much time to sync files to a public folder and on all of my Macintosh computers it logs out too slow and prevents my Mac's from shutting down because it won't log out of the .Mac site in a reasonable amount of time. It's good for basic personal uses but I'd avoid it as a solution for a business use.
5,Better priced than Apple Store,"Never understood why as a Mac user, we were and are forced to pay a premium price (well - retail, undiscounted) when purchased at an Apple Store. Shouldn't the factory store offer some slight discount cutting out the middle man of the distribution network?we already pay a premium for all things Mac, simply because, well - they're Mac, right?Anyway, I find it odd that I can get this from J&R; for 20% less than anywhere else. ANBD, no shipping price. NAmazon has to get off the charging Tax kick they're on tho, when you can order from anywhere else on line and not pay tax."
4,Great product but wish it came with a manual!,"I love all of services that come with this service. Although it is fairly easy to use and there are alot of online tutorials, I wish that it came with a detailed instruction manual. I ended up buying a book on iLife.Without the book, I was still able to do alot of the basic functions and able to get help through the on-line tutorials; however, the book will allow me to take my skills the next level!Overall, I still am satisfied with my purchase even though it did not come with a manual."
1,Unnecessary and overpriced,"With so many free methods available to upload one's web site with, it seemspreposterous that apple gets away with charging what they charge for this service. Users of iweb can almost as easily publish their site elsewhere for nothing. If you DO feel like you've got some money to burn, then by all means buy this here at amazon, where it typically runs $20 to $30 less than at apple's web site."
1,I was required,My teacher wanted ten bucks for this book in class for a high school world lit course. It's probably a better deal here. I found it was very badly printed with marking looking as if it were badly photocopied on several pages. I hate using this book and it's only value is if you're required to use it for a class.
5,Oklahoma Sooner Boot Slippers,"Comfy slippers...my wife bought me a pair in 1999 or so. Since then I have developed neuropathy and this is about all I can find comfort wearing. Except for Mens SAS Shoes.I have just ordered another pair. Only negative = soles will soak up moisture in rainy weather. Otherwise, amazing footwear."
1,mistaken...,"I thought that I was buying a MOVIE. How stupid was I? When one queries for DVD and it comes up with the title you are looking for and your getting charged 5.95 it seems like you might get the movie not a 312 word article about the movie! Apparently, I didn't pay attention close enough.None the less, the article is nice and makes me really want to get the actual movie but don't be mistaken, as I was, that you might be buying the movie because you aren't!"
5,Our Greatest Gift: Meditation on Dying and Caring,Henri Nouwen provides a well thought out view on dying. His concern is that we should treat dying as a normal part of living and we should examine our relationship with God. Death is a beautiful entrence to the Kingdom of Heaven and should be considered the next step in our life with God. This is an excellent book for those in ministry who work with families who are in grief due to the death of a loved one. The material provides background that may be utilized during funerals and consoling family members.
3,"Good Lewis Quotes, Tacky Ending","This book was an enjoyable reminder of many aspects of the Narnia chronicles. It didn't really provide much new insight (a second reading of the Chronicles would have probably been a better use of time), but the themes Edwards chose provided a nice organizational frame.I found the final section very troublesome. It presents an alleged conversation between Edwards and the ghost (?) of Lewis (as ""Jack""), who Edwards claims conversed with him via an online pop-up screen. Presented as factual, I feel this tactic is quite dishonest. Even if I was a believer in online ghosts, I would have a hard time understanding why ""Jack"" routinely interrupts Edwards, a feature I didn't think possible in an online chat forum.... Even if this section had been presented as a fictional account, I would have found it presumptuous of the author to put words into the mouth of C.S. Lewis."
3,Downtuned Crazyness,"Gazas EP has a more downtuned sound than their full lenght ""I dont care where i go when i die"" not as spastic and not as insane and a slower pace. With that said its still an essential 5 song (1 instrumental) EP to get. Expect the same unregonizable singing (the only lyrics i could understand was ""YOU SHUT THE F*** *P""), thick sludge guitars and headbanging good time. Great EP to work out too as with their full lenght, i highly recomended it. I would give it 4 stars but since its an EP i give it 3.5/5 stars."
5,Michigan Trees,"The title of this book says it all. If you want to find any tree in this state here is the book for you. The key to finding which tree species you are looking at is quite detailed and precise, so be sure to read the ""how to use this book"" section for all the terms. The book arrived in pristine condition, and in a timely manner. I would positively order from this book dealer again."
5,Excellent resource,A must have for anyone who desires to learn tree identification. Quite technical but has been in use since 1913.
1,Michigan Trees,I did not realize when I ordered this book that it was in black and white illustrations. I would have much more prefered it had colored photos of trees to help me identify them. I considered it a waste of money.
5,Michigan Trees - A Study with Broader Applications,"Michigan Trees was chosen by our Prof down here in New Jersey as the field manual for our work with trees in the lab - class of Theoretical and Field Biology. Of the wide range of species discussed and skillfully illustrated in the text, very few are native to Michigan and not to New Jersey. Although the volume is soft - cover, the outer is a durable and pliable synthesis of plastic and paper that makes this rich resource particularly suitable for field work."
3,Old,This album was not what I expected. They are older songs. Not as hot as the cover makes it seem.
5,A Magical Introduction to the Art & Work of Heather Valencia,"This is a beautiful and evocative documentary on the life, work and teachings of Heather Valencia, a Dreaming Woman, artist, and teacher, who lived on the Yaqui reservation for many years as the wife of their spiritual leader, Anselmo Valencia. The film shows her beautiful artwork, a magical transmutation using masks, and the elusive yet powerful work of the dream circle in the Yaqui tradition. Highly recommended, especially for women: the video will open and expand your soul to the higher reaches of the Great Dream!"
3,Stepping Stone to Great New Photography,I loved the Mavica FD73 for 18 months of use. I photograph archtecture for my business and met with a lot of approval. However the resolution is not up to par with what is now available.I upgraded to the Mavica FD91. Beautiful! Magnificant zoom and many brilliant features. Much better resolution and now have no need to use digital enhancing for sharpness or colours. I recommend the FD91
2,Sony MVC-FD73 is for users do not care about Sharp Pictures,"I recently got the Sony Mavica MVC-FD73. At first I thought it was cool, But it does have flaws. I think it's good for the price if you got kids who want to take pictures of their pets or take random pictures. Here is a list of pros and consPros: Cheap and afforable No hassel with memory cardsCons: Big and bulky Not even 1 megapixel, so the pictures come out blurry Tried everything in the manual and nothing seems to help.So I decided to sell this camera and will get a camera with at least 3-4 megapixels.Save your money and get something else that is more compact and has a higher resolution."
1,Terrible camera,This camera worked only for a short time. The battery would never hold a charge. Went in the trash.
