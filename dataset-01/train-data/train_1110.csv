2,There must be better options,"I bought this as a substitute to bottled water, however I wasn't that thrilled with it. Since it is just me and my husband the filter timer is useless to us. It counts down weeks, not gallons used. Since it is just two of us we don't use nearly as much water as a family of four would, so our filters should last longer. Also, the taste wasn't all that great. I'll be the first to admit that our tap water is pretty bad, but the filters didn't seem to improve it as much as I had hoped. We also had a hard time pouring water without the whole top lid falling off. The design isn't all that great. Overall I wasn't that impressed with this pitcher. I got rid of it and have decided to try the Pur water dispenser instead. So far I like that much better."
2,Could have been better,The product looked attractive and so I purchased it. The filter has slowed down the rate of filtration after only 7 days of use. Now once I fill water in the top container it needs around 10 mins to get filtered. It doesnt eliminate the odor of chlorine 100%.
2,Doesn't Filter,The pitcher is of high quality but the filter does not fit snugly. The water just goes into the gap without filtering.
2,poor design,"I purchased this pitcher because I wanted to save money by not buying bottled water. I liked the look of the pitcher as well. After using the pitcher I found that the filter doesn't fit securely in place. The water bypasses the filter and basically becomes a fancy looking unfiltered water pitcher. Not sure if I just got a defective pitcher, but noticed that other reviews stated the same thing. I wish I would have spent more time reading the reviews prior to making this purchase. I'm just gonna go with the basic Brita pitcher..."
1,HATE IT,"While my tap water is from a well and clean, it does have a bleachy taste, which is why I bought this pitcher. And I bought it in spite of the stupidity of the replacement gauge on the top, as others have detailed. I hate it and am finally going to get rid of it, bc I can't stand that the two-piece top is not at all secure and flies off easily, and bc the water easily spills out the back of the ""lid"" as well. Yes, the water tastes better, but the design of this is just plain idiotic and incredibly aggravating."
1,Leaks!,"I am in total agreement with the previous reviewer and would like to add that this thing LEAKS. It might have something to do with the fact that the top lid doesn't really fit correctly, but every single time I pour from this pitcher water gets everywhere. Just awful."
1,Piece of CRAP!!!,This is a piece of junk.... worst design ever made... Doesn't belong in the fridge.. belongs in the trash!!!! Would not recommend... The two piece on top is what makes it a piece of CRAP!!!
1,Brita filters are good...Brita pitchers are JUNK!!!!,"Update to my review from last Summer. I originally gave 2 stars, but had to come back and give it just 1 and only because I can't give zero. While Brita filters are pretty good, Brita pitchers are absolute junk. The lids always break and become useless. Until today, ALL of my Brita pitchers no longer have lids. Now they have no water because I tossed all of them into the trash. Now I need to figure out what to do with the 15 filters I purchased.The early Brita pitchers were great and kept any UNFILTERED water from entering the filtered water compartment of the pitcher. This Riviera 64-ounce waste of plastic allows the tap water to flow directly into the ""filtered"" water compartment if you let the water to be filtered go beyond the fill line. I will no longer buy Brita products and I recommend staying away from their overpriced JUNK PITCHERS because you will be disappointed."
3,"Poor design, but no clogging issues","Brita pitcher filters seem to rest higher up than Pur pitchers. You have to keep the water at a higher level so the filter doesn't dry out- a pain in the cuss and easy to forget. We had a Pur carafe before. It was great, but too expensive - the filter would clog about every two weeks. For this reason I prefer the Brita."
3,Skip the bells and whistles....,"...or, in this case, the electronic display and ""sleek"" design. This pitcher works as well as any Brita pitcher; there is a great improvement in the taste of our city water. The electronic display is supposed to display the percentage of time remaining until you need to change the filter. This display is of the quality of a digital watch you might get in a cereal box. It stopped working after a couple of months, and now flashes continously, which is a bit annoying. As other reviewers have said, the top cover pieces tend to flop off during pouring. Brita pitchers are great, but next time I will stick to a basic model."
3,Britta Chrome Pitcher,This pitcher fulfills it's basic function and provides great tasting water. The filter indicator did not function from day one. Fancy add on but useless.
2,Not the Quality I Expected from Brita,"Had to replace an old pitcher, so I ordered this because of the slim design as it would take less room in the frig. Quality is awful. Leaks almost every time I pour a glass of water and if it's full, the water will push the top off and it all comes splashing out. Still filtes the water as well, but the design of the top is poor."
4,Fits in the Door,"I had an 80oz. Brita in my apartment-sized refrigerator, but we had to suddenly live full time in my condo and I needed the space, so I ordered this one. It does fit in the door just fine, but the lid does not click on tight and I have to be careful so I don't spill when I put it in the door or I have to wait until the filtration is done. Otherwise, other than the fact that it's not 80oz., it's great."
1,Front piece does not stay put,"I purchased this pitcher and the Everyday Pitcher. The Everyday Pitcher just plain is better. This pitcher features a piece that is supposed to instruct you on when to change the filter, however, it does not stay in place and often falls off during normal use (pouring a glass of water. Also, the filters do not fit well in the pitcher, causing the water to flow down without actually being filtered. Needs work."
2,Lack of documentation,They're assuming I know what to do (WRONG)... and I don't blame you for my lack of knowledge. There was no schematic or directions on how to work this. No serial or model numbers to Google it. And WORST of ALL... I received it POSTAGE DUE!!!! WHY did I pay for shipping????
4,"Good, sturdy toy. Comes with storage tray","I thought these were the big cardboard blocks when I ordered them, (should have read the description better) but they are cute so I kept them. Cute little blocks."
3,"Nice enough, but poor quality for the pricetag.","We had purchased the Castle Blocks set for our son this holiday, and I have to say that, for the money, I was very disappointed to find several blocks in the set that had misplaced (crooked) decals on them, or decals that were incomplete and scraped. It is sloppy work for something that costs $30+. Even cheap block set companies are able to imprint paint onto a raised surface, which seems to work far better than the decals.I suppose that if I paid $10, I would have expected this."
3,hard to find a quality print,This I think is one of the better Roy Rogers B Westerns. But for my money I have viewed the Synergy print and it is not as good as the Marengo print which is offered as a double feature.Your best bet is Marengo Films in this case.

4,Decent for the price,Good knife for the price. Cool looking piece. Seems durable enough. Watch out for the belt clip - sharp point catches on everything.
2,Best Book written on WW-II Airships,"Of all the books written about the participation of U.S. Navy blimps in protecting our convoys and other individual ships during WW-II, this is the most entertaining and authentic book outthere... Gordon Vaeth should know, he was there and did it all.Never was a ship lost to a German submarine that was escorted by a U.S. Navy blimp. They were always there and the German subswere truely scared of them. Yes, we did cause the sinking ofseveral subs, regardless of what others say."
4,My Thoughts on a Great Toy,"When I ordered this toy I expected lots of fun, and that's what I got. If you think it's not fun because it breaks a lot, first of all follow the age group recommendation. If you're not good at building things that fall apart easily, you shouldn't buy this product. When I looked at the box in a store I thought the back had no room, and then when I got it I was surprised to see room. I made a little quad laser cannon and put it in. It's also cool because it has lots of guys and cannons for destroying anything. I like the bumpy pieces at the bottom so it looks like it hovers above the ground, just like in the movie. It's a good buy for the size. There's a little piece of paper in it that corrects how you make the doors; you should choose what comes in the rule book because the rack of battle droids slides in and out a lot more easily. I recommend this toy!!!!!"
3,Not bad but not great,"When I ordered this toy, I was really excited. But then once I built it, the doors did not fit well and would not stay on. When I tried to fix them, the entire model began to come apart. Above all, it's really just for display and not to play with."
4,cute story,"This story has soft illustrations with nicely rhyming text. It won't teach numbers and counting (as the title might imply), but it is a cute story about some friendly animals. There is quite a variety of animals included and the entire book was quite a hit with my two and a half year old."
4,Undecided....,"I was told to try this product by my hairdresser. My hair had been falling out due to stress and she told me this would not only stop it, but help to regrow my hair. I have 4 stars because I definitely have noticed my hair loss has slowed down, but not so sure if its actually helping to regrow my hair. Not yet anyway. But I'm definitely happy the hair loss has slowed down. And my nails grow like crazy!! They never did before...so that was an unexpected bonus :)"
3,"""Fatal Attraction"" in Beauty and the Beast","An ex-fiance comes back into Catherine's life. Catherine is not terribly comfortable with this as we see from flashbacks that the breakup up was not particularly amicable. Vincent is very uncomfortable with this as he battles feelings of jealously. He also worries for Catherine's safety as he is haunted by ominous dreams of Catherine being in danger.The notion of an ex-fiance coming back into Catherine's life could potentially have made a compelling episode, but unfortunately this episode goes off into an unimaginative ""fatal attraction"" direction.In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale. 31 fans participated. ""Down to a Sunless Sea"" finished 36th out of the 44 episodes.I placed ""Down to a Sunless Sea"" 37th in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes."
1,Embarassing,"This item was ordered as a Christmas gift for my father. It arrived as if it had been dropped and run over by a truck, and then gift wrapped by Amazon. The damage was not noticeable until the wrapping was removed. An absolute shame. My father is very old school and even after much pleading, he is too proud to return the item. Not to mention, ""That's what you get for shopping on the computer!"" The box was smashed and most of the tools inside were bent or broken. I cannot comprehend how this could have passed any inspection. It was embarrassing to have gifted such a disaster."
1,Item pictured is not what you receive,The item pictured is no longer available from the manufacturer. If you order this item what you will receive is a solid stainless set also by Mr. Bar B Q. The set will have no wooden handles or rubber gripes. After checking with several retailers I found THAT THE SET YOU WILL ACTUALLY RECEIVE IS BETTER QUALITY THAN WHAT IS PICTURED. I kept the set and gave to my Son for Christmas. He was very pleased. The reason for the low rating was because the wrong item is displayed.
4,"great tools, horrible case","Being a mother of two small children I usually buy things based on the good chance of them being destroyed in the long run. With that said, after reading reviews I figured that the case couldn't be that bad because my standards are not high. After receiving the package I was appalled by the low quality of the case. I can't tell if this is made of extremely cheap plastic or high quality cardboard. If you are buying for a good case DO NOT buy this product but if you are more about what is inside the case the actual tools are fantastic. The spatula is huge but not a problem for me. Also, the tools were all out of there pockets due to shipping but no damage was done and I was able to pop them back into their rightful places."
3,Not he greatest story,The book itself is good quality but I was a little disappointed in the story...kinda drags and didnt keep my childs interest. Ok overall just not as good as I had hoped.
5,A fun read for all ages.,This is a delightful book. It is fun for both adults and children. The illustrations are well done and you can see something different in the pictures each time you look! A fun read for adults and children.
1,A Fine Example of when the Illustrator and Author do not speak....,Although I think the illustrations are lovely I really disagree with the previous reviewer. During a residency for a Library Science class we were asked to look at ARC of some children's books and this was one of the titles I chose. I found the illustrations did not match the text. The illustrations would have been fine for the original tale of Little Red Riding Hood. But for a reverse of the tale it did not work. The wolf was too scary and one does not sympathize with scary creatures. I would not recommend this title.
4,awesome for a local band,"these guys are awesome. i saw them at a local show the other day and they rocked!best tracks include-doing someting, give me the prozac, and prom night. if you live in western mass try to get to one of the local shows to see these guys."
1,Cansada De Besar Sapos (Tired of kissing Frogs),"I was extremely disappointed that this DVD came loose in the case and therefore when I opened it up, it was all scratched up."
3,wooomp woomp,"Man, what can I say. Your better off buying a REAL straight razor. The handle is all plastic and the blade is delivered sharp BUT I wouldnt recommend putting this on your face. For some reason, no matter how many times I sharpen this, it still wont cut hair unless you go two or three times. Should be used as a novelty or for cutting veggies. NO NO to the face unless you want to look like you got into a knife fight."
5,"READ THIS BOOK, it gives helpful advice!","A friend, who is the former wife of an abusive man (who eventually killed himself after trying to kill her), says:""This book is boldly written to express the pain of an abusive man who changed his life by coming to grips with the anguish which caused his destructive behavior.""The book is well-written, and arranged in an amazinly-helpful format.""It's not very long but contains what you need to know to get help for yourself, if you are an angry man, or to understand or offer counseling to an angry man who is driven by the wounds of his past.""It also defines the emotional truama that the woman goes through in a relationship with such a man, and offers advice to such women. It identifies what abuse is, and that it can be found in all levels of society.""A MUST READ FOR MEN AND WOMEN living in the cycle of abuse....."
5,Get Help Here!,"What a great help for women married to angry men, usually abused as boys (and the men, if they'll take the help). Dr. Hedgestrom has the medicine if you'll take it. His counseling program is also amazing."
3,Angry Men and the Women who love them,The psychology in the book was excellent. I especially appreciated that it discussed both sides of the relationship. What I didn't like were the Christian references. It was very annoying and there were many pages that I completely skipped over because of the Christianity. If you can overlook Christian references then this book was very insightful and helpful to me.
1,This book is all wrong,Any reasonable person ought to avoid this book. It is NOT helpful. It has been written by a person who obviously knows nothing about the real causes and effects of violence. Total inane drivel. He is an embarrassment. Please don't heed the advice contained in this book. You will regret it.
5,AWESOME!,"THIS is the Pride CD of the summer! Forget ""Pride '04"" and ""GayDays 2004"", this CD is one of the best mixes of the latest club hits, not just a rehash of old songs we've heard a million times. ""Superstar"", ""Love Profusion"", ""Toxic"" and more of the great stuff we've been dancing to lately in a non-stop mix that will keep you moving non-stop. Definitely highly recommended!!!"
1,Bachmann GP50 UP,"Bachmann has been known to be on the lower quality, entry level side of the model train hobby, and sadly, I think they've gotten even worse.The GP 50 proved to be a weak performer, and started to overheat and severely lose power after only a couple of hours of run time, slowing to a crawl.Headlight is very dim.I opened it up to lubricate it and look for problem areas, and it literally fell apart.The lights aren't even soldered in place; they are simply clipped on and pressed between the chassis halves.The screws and threaded anchors barely reach each other, and the threads wouldn't even hold the chassis halves together!I've thrown it in my parts junkyard, as there isn't much worth salvaging from this piece of junk.Bachmann claims to have a very good warranty policy, but why bother?They're just going to send me another piece of junk like this one.Total waste of money.Not recommended."
1,Got time to wait,"I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one. The outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, I guess it depends who defines a few minutes. Both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water. To make a pot, that would be 100 minutes. I am returning as I am definitely disappointed."
3,No More HP For Me!,"GREAT machine other than TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS! It will NOT copy in black & white (unless you SCAN and THEN PRINT). Imagine the time & money wasted when you need to make a quick copy of notes from a yellow notepad . . . since the K60 prints the entire copy with the yellow background! Even though I bought my K60 directly from HP, I believe the sales rep forgot to mention this to me . . . and the COPY button on the front panel says ""Black/Color""! The OTHER PROBLEM is that it sometimes (more often than any other printer I've owned) pulls two sheets of paper through to print. (There is a provision to allow you to adjust for paper types but this is time-consuming!) I'm now looking for a 2nd PRINTER for another location and a SCANNER but you can bet they WILL NOT BE HP!"
3,K60 or K80?,"I have seen previous reports on K60, and decided to buy a K80, with TWO COPY BUTTONS, black and colour copy.The machine is not intuitive to use, but it does what you would expect, with two advantages against K60: modem speed, and black copy key.It has a major problem wich most users will not detect!It works well when driven by HP suplied software, but if we try to scan from MS Office XP ""image scanning"" and some other aplications, the machine scans only the first page, ejecting all the others, forcing us to feed the document page by page by hand.Quite frustrating for a machine with a 20 page feeder.It will became a great machine with a new modem and a driver patch, unfortunately not available for the moment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH $3.94!,"I am a teacher and have a college degree. So I am not a weirdo just sounding off. This book is CRAP. This guy Hodges takes everything that Patsy Ramsey says or writes and trys to make it sound as negative as possible. I absolutely hate this book. I am not saying that without a doubt Patsy Ramsey was not guilty, but I sure am not going to insinuate that every word she says is self incriminating. I don't know when this POS was published, but I hope to God that it was after Patsy Ramsey died. The stuff he says and insinuates is enough to kill someone. There is no worse horror than losing a child. The only thing I can think of that would come close would be to lose a child and then WRONGLY be accused of being the perpetrator. Do not buy this book and contribute to the financial well-being of the author Hodges."
1,Confessed Killer in Thailand 8-16-2006,"I would bet that the author of this book feels like a total idiot for writing a book accusing the mother of killing her child. I didn't buy the book and now I see why. I never believed the mother or father was the killer.NEWS ALERT - Confessed murder of JonBent Ramsey found in Thailand.If I was the family, I would be suing this author for slander!"
1,Ridiculous,"I have to wonder what the author of this book, as well as the author's of these reviews, would say about the recently disclosed FACT that DNA found in JonBenet's body does NOT match the Ramsey's. The DNA is in the form of SEMEN. Now unless any one of you can prove that Patsy Ramsey magically makes semen then you may have a leg to stand on here by accusing this woman of murdering her own daughter. It's absolutely ridiculous to me. And the author of this book, while playing slight of hand, much like a magic trick, knows nothing of the actual facts and evidence of the case. It is always disturbing and sad to me when I see so many of my fellow citizens all too eager to point the finger of blame at people so easily, without the facts, simply based on hocus pocus, half baked psycho babble. How scary is this that people like this sit on juries when accused's lives are on the line?!UNBELIEVABLE."
1,Idiots.,"Dont know why people thought it was someone in the family. Nor do I know why the author ""clearly knows"" that it was the mother. Haha, guess he was wrong. Hope he gets sued for slander."
2,Very Disappointing,"I found this work to be a major let down. I was expecting to find a systematic study of the ransom note, instead, I found what others had already written about: a baseless ""this means that"" without any consistent application. What this means for me is that the method that Dr. Hodges used on the ransom note cannot be applied to other written statements, or even other ransom notes. There is no reference point to work from.Perhaps it is because I was expecting a form of Statement Analysis (under whatever term) that I was let down, but I did not find any technique used that could be applied to other cases.I believe the ransom note is a fake, and it was written by Patsy Ramsey, but can say why I believe these things, and can use principles in analysis that can be repeated to all statements. Here, it is not a scientific method, but an arbitrary assigning of meaning to words."
5,I think Hodges is right about the how/why/who of this murder,"This version of the JonBenet case was simpler and more readable to me than ""Who Will Speak for Jon Benet?"" by the same author. I found it all readable and believable. I agree with other reviewers who found Hodges' conclusions ""right on"" ... He convinced me! A sentence on Page 180 of the paperback edition summed up the whole case to me and explains why no arrests have been made and probably never will be. It took two to tango."
3,Justice for JonBenet,"This book, written by a very learned and respected scholar and psychiatrist, is interesting and reaches a conclusion that has significant support - namely that Patsy Ramsey wrote the infamous 'ransom' note. However, it may not be the best introductory book on the Ramsey case since it is very lean on facts and very high in analysis that is (or was) fairly unorthodox. Students of the Ramsey case will inevitably come to read this book and will eventually enjoy it, but it isn't a primer on the case."
5,"Sherlock Holmes meets Sigmund Freud, again.","This book is fascinating for the general reader, for forensic experts and for psychologists like me. Dr. Hodges has demonstrated the wisdom that Freud found in his ""Psychopathology of Everyday Life"", that we cannot keep secrets, our unconscious mind speaks volumes. This finds a new application in the work that Dr. Hodges has produced.Importantly, this work will eventually be subject to a real world test. When the killer(s) of JonBenet Ramsey is(are)finally brought to justice, Dr. Hodges conclusions will be tested. The result will benefit both forensic investigation and psychoanalysis.Stay tuned for the final chapter."
3,Confessed Killer is a wacko fake,"The book could have been written better, but the story is on the money. Karr's confession is bogus. He's a nut-case, but he didn't kill Jonbenet."
5,"A thorough and evocative analysis, unique and compelling.","Dr. Hodges has opened up new ways to understand written communications by applying new analytic models to forensic evidence. We both understand more about the possible murderer and her motives, and a way to approach sometimes baffling evidence. After reading Dr. Hodges's book, we come to believe more Freud's conviction that we cannot help but to confess to our inner experience in disguised ways"
4,Wildflowere: Revised and Updated,"This is a small field book that is well organized to allow you to find the flowers you are looking for. Principally, it is organized by color."
1,Not Photo Paper,"Don't be fooled by the description. There is no difference between this paper and ""regular"" printing paper. It is essentially the same thing in different packaging."
4,great for new comers,This is a great book for new comers to the horse owning world. Some of the information you might know if you are very into the horse world and know people who own horses. The book gives you a great overview of all the horse owning responsibilities. This book helped me with my first horse.
3,Slimming cream: In the eyes of the beholder,"If you notice it talks about ""appearance"" and you have to apply it 2 times a day. I thought it was worth a try... so I bought this product about 4 months ago. I have not been a consistent user. I don't think it helped on my tummy even tho I do 125 crunches, 24 pushups, Kinesis for 25 minutes, and Spin 45 minutes 3XperWeek. Where it seemed most helpful was firming my neck of all things, probably because there was deeper penetration and around my face I might be willing to apply 2 a day.It may have given a temporary ""look"" on legs, as claimed but actually I felt like any results vanished after I walked away from the mirror."
5,Awesome.,"This ship is very large compared to the price of it. It also icludes the control center of course, but it isn't as cool, and I don't play with it much. To my surprise, the whole ship-rotating-around-the-cockpit thing works near perfectly. One of the more fun Legos to build, I highly recommend this."
5,Very cool; highly recommended.,"Although Lego has shown a tendency to skimp on pieces in these Star Wars sets (to make them more affordable, I would guess, and to off-set the expense of all the new pieces that they include), the B-wing set is not a disappointment. Clever rotating cockpit with unique pilot figure, storage compartment, and articulating wings are good features, and the Rebel Control Center makes this a great set for kids with a limited collection. It is not just a bunch of random pieces; it really increases the playability. R2-style robot and technician are neat touches too. Anyone who complains that the kit isn't true to scale is missing the point; it is a little small, but all these mini-fig sets are toys, not models!"
5,fun,this toy is fun. i got it with my b day money and it is grate. the funist part is the control center it has sliding dors and all cinds of cool stuff. if you are in to bilding legos this is grate to get. it is big and very fun. it is very time consuming so if you are exited this passes time.
4,Nice album,This is a very nice album from Ali Farka Tour. Songs are strong and unique. Highly recommended.
3,"I'd give it a good, solid 6","First of all, the buyer should be aware these are not original recordings, but transcriptions for sax of several standrs, some origionally performed by voice, some other instruments. There are a few sax standards here as well. It is well performed though, a couple of the tracks are good-and-down-and-dirty fun. Overall, this sounds like a fun CD to use for background music for a 50's party with lots of chatter...."
3,Good product,"i liked it, its a smart idea and saves buying larger bras that i'll need only while pregnant.i received no problems there although i only got 1 instead of 2, but i did not email or complain. I am sure if I did they would have done something about it. I just didn't have the time."
5,Suzanne McDermott The Glory,"""Suzanne McDermott shines on her new CD, ""Glory"". Her crystalline voice reminds me of Judy Collins, and her eye for detail and turns of phrase tell vivid, compelling stories. Intriguing, beautiful work, and highly recommended.""-Susanne Millsaps, Breakfast Jam, KRCL 90.9FM,"
1,Good Plot - Poor Tecnical Quality,"This release from UAV (United American Video) has very, very poor visual and sound quality. I suppose that is why the price is so low, but it's not worth watching. Find this good movie released by someone else like Republic Home Video or such."
4,A little bigger would make the Kaiser Springform pan better,"I used my normal cheesecake recipe but found the Kaiser spring form to be too shallow to accomodate the entire recipe. I didn't measure it before hand, as it was a 10"" pan like my CHEAP one. SO, in the future, I am afraid that for THAT one fabulous cheesecake recipe I will have to rely on my cheaper 10"" pan. It WAS nice to have the glass bottom upon which to cut and serve the dessert. I would have given it five stars if it had been an inch and a half deeper. It just never occurred to me that the pan did not have the capacity I needed."
2,not really worth the money,"I bought this because my old Calphalon 10"" spring form pan broke. This pan will leak so wrap with 2 layers of foil. This pan is not nearly as sterdy as the Calphalon I had. The bright spot is the glass bottom."
4,invaluable for metalsmiths,A very good book which explains in depth most hydraulic die forming. a must-have for metalsmiths.
4,Small and shallow,"For what I got this for, it works just fine: a small water dish for my bearded dragon. The size is just fine but the bowl is pretty shallow; it's hard not to splash water around. I certainly can't see this as a food bowl for any type of animal; there's room for sliced veggies but the leafy greens would be too fluffy and just fall right out."
2,overpriced for what you get,"low quality ,block made in china,would not buy,the knifes you would use the most are not in the set"
3,Not that sharp,"These were not as good to cook with as I had thought they would be.They are not very sharp but do come with a sharpener ,which helps."
2,The knives rust,I like the knife set in general. However half the knives have rusted and I have to throw them away. I only recently bought this knife 3 months ago.
5,Novice Kitchen Enthusiast,"A very solid knife set, especially with the extra slots for those who have a few ""favorite"" knifes left in the drawer. MAKE SURE when you buy Henckels to get the ""twin"" set instead of the single little henckel-man, that's a big upgrade in quality. Oh, and for goodness sake people, quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go."
3,henckle my jenkle,"alright this is a decent knife set, from germany not china so i thought they would have more weight to them but they are sharp and good enough for my kitchen and my needs but if you want better quality and thicker knives id pay a extra 100$ to get something better but for the price i like them they are pretty good for starters"
2,Dind't receive what I bought,"I have been using amazon for years know and I can say I am a very happy customer, actually a fan. This Knives are quite nice, and is not the first time I bought knives from amazon, however I am really disappointed as I didn't get the 8-inch chef's; 8-inch carving; 5-inch utility; 4-inch paring offered, instead I got only the 8-inch chef's and a bunch of tiny knives (5-inch utility; 4-inch paring; 2-inch pealing) like Tommy ""airman"" below, to make things worst, this was a gift for my parents!!I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO BUY THIS ITEM, instead get the Henckels International Fine Edge Pro Stainless-Steel 7-Piece Knife Set with Block, which I personally own, they beautiful, very sharp and very complete set"
4,Well written bio captures Hamilton's romantic character,"Flexner vividly recounts Hamiltons life and career through age 26. This reads like Dickens writing history - from Hamilton's miserable, impoverished home life until age 10, his teenage life in his adopted country, (America), his career in the Continental Army, his love for Elizabeth Schuyler.Flexner Brings the young Hamilton to life through his letters and actions in the revolution. This book has a vividness that is remarkable. The famous and not so famous participants in the story come to life also - George Washington, The Marquis de Lafayette, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, etc.This book has been criticized for being overly ""psycological"". This aspect is not over done. Simply put, this is a great story - well told, well researched. Highly recommended."
5,Fun,I thought this would be a fun book to have in my library. The service was excellent. I have been very satisfied with this old copy.
2,"Junk, trash, etc","This thing is a peice of junk and buy dot com wont take it back after 20 days, it locks up with fatal application error and the maps are terribly out of date.ASIN:B000K2DHQW Sanyo NVM-4030 Navigation System]]"
2,Just an expensive printer,"HP states that this machine will work with one phone line. I beg to differ. It repeatedly picks up the line to receive a fax when I'm on the phone with people. Also, it does not pick up reliably when a fax is coming. The scanning is inferior, and displays lines on the images...Won't be buying HP any time soon."
2,"good printer, bad FAX","I have owned this printer/fax/scanner/copier for just under two years. Today, the fax finally wouldn't work anymore. I have always had problems with the fax not being reliable, just like other people have stated in other reviews. I would have to keep unplugging the unit. I am glad I bought the extended warrenty on it. I took it back to the store today. I'm waiting to see what they'll replace it with. It's a good thing HP doesn't sell this printer anymore. I liked the printer part, it scanned well, and copied well also. I run my own construction business and needed a reliable FAX. Very Disappointing, at least it'll be replaced. I'm glad to hear that other people experience the same exact problems I did."
1,Seller ignores request for missing parts,"Re:Transaction ID: 700209056491Listing ID: 0103L605191I emailed Mr. Nayank the seller and requested two missing parts. His response to my claim that ""the missing two (2) missing media supports and one support extension"" were not to be included with the HP3200 package.He was WRONG. I attached photocopy from the HP3200 manual showing such devices listed in Chapter 1, page 14.The seller never responded again!Tom"
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting the Insides Flaps to be also made of leather, but to my disappointment it was Plastic. The picture was deceiving as they were not showing the inside flap clearly. I sent an email to the seller and I got an acknowledgment saying that they received my email and will get back to me. Until today I never got any email. I will not recommend this product to anyone."
3,May not fit all passports,"I loved this cover for my Albanian passport. It fit perfectly and it did the job of protecting the passport from warping from handling it in my numerous travels. It's also practical as you can use it to store little paper items such as your boarding pass.However, I was disappointed to find that it does not fit my Canadian passport. the cover is not wide enough for it. If you need a cover for a Canadian passport look elsewhere."
4,Practical and efficient,A basic product. Does the job. A great value for the price. I would definately buy again.
1,Died too soon,"Was good till it died in little over a year - the warranty only covers 1 year. Perhaps I made mistake by carrying it around in a hard case one too many times. Tried all the steps LaCie tech service suggested, no help. It's simply dead. Will be my last Lacie for sure. A slick look counts for very little if it can't do the job."
1,Wrong Picture Amazon!! UPDATE: AMAZON FIXED THE PROBLEM,Talk about misinforming your customers Amazon! The model in the picture is completely different and much better than what you are actually selling!
4,"If you love historical yet flowing prose, this is for you",Wonderful look at an area which is often overlooked for it's beauty and rich culture because of all the constant turmoil of the region. Glass grew up with some of the language and culture. This is obvious as he explores in-depth the areas he travels to and attempts to reproduce the travels of those before him. I thought the book was a good mix of history and culture intertwined into his daily travel and musings. The book is somewhat of a cathartic reminiscence as he relates his humbling time of kidnapping. But as such the recounting helps to bring stark reality back to the nature of that region and force us to consider the reasons 'why' pain and suffering are necessary in such a mythical and adventurous place. I've recommended this book to two friends who are news correspondents and love to travel. Thumbs up!
3,Dry product received.,"The product is really great. I have used it before. The one I received in this order was dry and clay like which is not how the product normally is. It should be creamy. it's to much trouble to return it. I you can find this product in it normal state, it REALLY WORKS!"
3,Ho hum,"""Passionate Deceptions"" is your typical soft-core erotic thriller, especially from MRG Entertainment which by and large sucks. It doesn't go beyond the norm like the old Mystique Films did from Playboy's storehouse of late-night fare; instead it IS the norm (really the norm from around 10 years before this was produced). The sex scenes are above average taken on their own merits, but they lose luster when you factor in the nearly-complete lack of explicit nudity, and most disappointing, the unattractive actresses. Well, maybe ""unattractive"" is a bit harsh, but these definitely are not the A-listers. I mean Tamara Landry is the top cat, and she looks like she has spent more time in the office of Dr. 90210 than of the office of any casting director.Could have been so much better with soft-core Hall of Famers, like Tracy Ryan, Renee Rea, Shannon Whirry...heck, even Maria Ford."
2,Don't buy it for the Alarm Clock!!,"Okay, so this is an awesome product if you ALREADY HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK!!! I bought it for college so I'd have something to wake me up, but this alarm clock is so unreliable I have to use my cell phone!!!However, It has fairly good speakers to listen to your ipod which is nice. It is also very good looking and STURDY!! I already pulled it off of my desk and it was like nothing happened. It is high quality stuff. Just the electronic stuff is very confusing.So, if you're looking for a place to charge and listen to your ipod and for something that will not break, this is your product!"
3,32 inch grabers,I never received my order in the time promised. Sent a message to Isokentics and received a response saying my items were reordered. I finally received my order about 2 weeks later. I am not happy with their delivery service and would not deal with them in the future.
5,Delightful Regency Romp,"I have enjoyed all of Lois Greiman's books, but was unprepared for this lighter vein. The plot is fun altho predictable, the heroine adorable and the hero heroic without being stodgy...all the time. His appalled attraction to Georgiana is marvelous fun to read and his annoyance at her dimissal of ""who he is"" also fun. Loved every minute."
5,Fun with Memorable Characters,"This was charming! Georgiana is wonderful - very naive & sheltered, from the country, and yet also imaginative and clever. She's always wished she was born a boy, so that she could grow up to be a real Bow Street Runner detective. And though she has had no training, and so her methods include wild goose-chases and clumsy calamities, beneath it all she has a quick mind that solves the mystery in the end. I enjoyed how everyone underestimates her, because of her beauty, eccentric enthusiasm and her youth .. including the hero at first (mostly humoring her for her attractive body & face). But eventually during the course of the story the hero begins to see that she really *is* smart underneath all the other trappings and she sincerely earns his respect.It's nice to see a story that can give you a romance based on a strong sexual attraction but also show you how the two people admire and enjoy each other out of bed as well."
2,"Pretty good, but not worth buying.","Georgiana is a smart young lady who wants to gain respect and admiration for her detective abilities. Someone stole a necklace from the hostess's bedroom during a party. While Georgiana investigates, one of her suspects assists her. She jumps to conclusions too fast, but eventually succeeds in solving the mystery. I wasn't surprised or delighted. The heroine was a little too syrupy sweet for me. The story was half solving the mystery and half developing the romance. The ending was cute.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: Bath, England, probably regency period. Copyright: 2000. Genre: mystery regency romance."
1,Not worth reading,"I was misled by the glowing reviews into buying this book. What a mistake! We are told over and over again how clever the heroine is, but what the story shows is that she is uterly devoid of intelligence and common sense--hence the disasters she keeps on creating. The story is full of improbable scenes. I, for one, would like to know how the hero and heroine, after falling into the water in the Pump Room, manage to get home without being observed by anyone, or have their servants notice that their clothes are ruined and thus make a fuss."
2,Cannot spray it,"I do love the smell, but have no idea why it did not work no matter how hard I pressed the sprayer!!!!!And yea... I just broke the bottle...."
2,If it really worked,It has some type of plastic coating on the sprayer. tried to loosen the plastic and broke the bottle. No more smell good.
5,My wife love it,"I will give this two thumbs up, my wife like to wear it to work, not to strong and the price is resonable. so i would recommend this to anyone."
3,There's Tapes and the Real Thing,"I had recently decided to reread the Ender Series, but I wanted to listen to it, since it takes me so long to read now that I am so busy. But I have lots of time in the car....So I purchased these audio tapes. What upset me was that these works are abridged. They are the not the whole story. I searched for better ones that had the whole book, but I couldn't find any anywhere. So if you don't mind hearing the abridged version, these are good. But I didn't like it very much, even though it made me remember the parts I had read more vividly. The Ender series is wonderful and well done, but the tapes aren't all that they appear to be."
4,The book is hard to follow.,Ender`s Game is hard to follow. It has many characters so it is hard to keep track of who they are and what they do. It has many things that may happen in the future. It has aliens called buggers and they attack the Earth twice and we beat them luckily. I think the book should have more action with the battles in space . I think if you like science fiction you should like this book well.
5,Speechless,I just finished reading this book and i dont know what to say it is unfair to this book to try and compare to other books i have never read anything that scratches the service of being as good as this one if you read a book read this one.
2,Applique Masterpiece: Affairs of the Heart,"Ms Rossmann's exploration of many possibilities using a heart motif results in an array of very interesting designs, and her use of color is fascinating. However, these are unlikely patterns for a novice, since the instructions for transferring the designs and the methods she gives are archaic. A person skilled in applique can do much with the patterns. A good basic book on hand applique is recommended for others."
2,no needle-turn applique technique information,"I was hoping for some helpful hints about needle-turn applique but there is absolutely nothing here about the applique process. Only instructions are about quilt construction. I was also surprised by how poorly the author does needle-turn applique. The photos clearly show poorly done, jagged curves and obvious large stitches. I can do better than this and I'm a mere novice. Interesting colors and patterns, but that's the easy part! I was disappointed in this book."
4,Great Patterns,"Lots of great applique ideas and patterns. One of the better pattern boks I've seen (and believe me I have the typical quilters LOTS of books!) Great for mini-quilts, pillows, or the real deal."
3,Less than expected,"This kennel was less than I expected, a little more durable than I had hoped for and very very easy to collapse ( a little to easy to collapse) but great for storage and easy light transportation."
5,Very Good!!,I could not believe the price of this crate. It was so inexpensive and functions so well! We have had this crate for over six months now and no problems! We bought it for our chihuahua and it is spacious for her but small enough to fit in our bedroom without getting in the way. We love it! It also folds down so easily for storage or transportation. Super easy to clean with a vacuum cleaner and pull out tray can be tossed into the dishwasher if needed!
5,So easy.,"This kennel was a great buy. I received it before school one morning and thought I'd take a couple minutes to assemble what I could, but little did I know it was going to be so easy. I had it set up in the blink of an eye; and it was just as easy to fold back up. It's not too bulky, either, so it's easy to carry around. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who transports their pet, but doesn't need or want a bulky kennel for the car."
3,why not INCLUDE the right adapters to begin with?,"I bought a Brita faucet water filtration system. I struggled to installed it with the included plastic adapters, but it would pop off. So I called the Brita customer service(1-800-24-BRITA) and they said they would send me out the non-plastic faucet adapters and that should fix the problem. OK great...I get the nice metal adapters and I get it installed. Every so often it would pop off, we would reattach it until one day when it would not reattach. So I called Brita customer service(1-800-24-BRITA). They said the threads were probably stripped due to trying to install it with the plastic adapters which had come with the unit.They sent me out a whole new unit, with a new filter. Why not just include the nice metal adapters to begin with? Think of how many people give up on this product without calling customer service(1-800-24-BRITA)...not good for the brand name and bad for the landfills."
3,Talk about leaks!!,"While the installation was a breeze, I hadn't had this thing but a few days before it started spraying all over the place! I've taken it off and put it back on a couple times but the problem remains. I guess I'll have to invest in something more expensive in order to get quality."
4,OK for NYC water,NYC water clogs faucet filters fast. I've tried a few systems and so far this one has lasted the longest. It'll go for a month+ before it needs replacement. Not the full four months Brita claims but the other brands I tried lasted less than two weeks. I've had the system for 6 months.
1,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR...CALL BRITA IMMEDIATELY AND ASK FOR METAL CONNECTORS,In reference to the connection problems everyone is having ...save yourself potential headache and IMMEDIATELY call the Brita 800 # and ask for metal connectors. I haven't had success keeping the connection tight without the metal ones. The cheap plastic connectors included in the original package are almost guaranteed to fail. Brita must know this...I wish they would fix this problem and just include the metal ones standard.
1,Attachments don't work!!,"We just returned the third one of these filters. The filter itself may be good or not, we don't really know, because we couldn't use it at all. The attachments that come with the kit, to secure it to the faucet are defective, and pop out as soon as the water pressure gets up. We initially thought that we got a defective one, but after three attempts, well...Don't they have a quality control before they let those units out of production?? Bottomline, if you have a faucet that will require you to use the attachments, don't even bother!."
1,Quick Summary,"Unfortunately, I've purchases three of these before. The first the light stopped working so I returned it. The second fell off while I was washing dishes and I could never get it back on because the connectors were plastic and and the threading got all messed up. I bought this last one and the light stopped working again after 6 months. Crap product. Third time's a charm. I'm buying something else."
1,Don't waste your $$,"This product filters well, water tastes nice and fresh when it comes out, but if you turn the faucet above a trickle, even while the filtration is disengaged, it may shoot off the faucet and into the sink. This is unacceptable. I will be complaining to the manufacturer."
1,Install it without the strainer?,"I have been going through the installation difficulty that many people complained about here. So far I have exchanged the product 3 times and none of them could be installed properly due to the junk plastic adapter/threading. Finally I found a temporary solution today - I took out the strainer so the plastic threading is deep enough to stay on the adapter. To prevent leaking, I put plumbing tapes on the adapter. Now the filter stays on the faucet just fine and there's no water leak. But I am not sure whether the product will function properly without the strainer."
1,Very bad product,basically it does not attach to the faucet...I don't understand why they put in the market such a bad product.
2,Created with flimsy plastic materials,"The brita filter functions well - it filters the water and it tastes better than your regular tap water. However it comes with flimsy plastic accessories. If you screw it even a little bit tight it ""snaps"" past the groove and becomes completely loose. You can also easily knock it off the faucet while washing dishes if the dish or your hand bumps into it. I kept screwing it back on but eventually got tired of it. If you want a filter - buy one that does not have plastic screws.Definitely would not buy this item again."
1,Do not take this off after it is installed!,The unit was stripped after taking it off the faucet once! It is a waste of mony!
3,"Ok, I guess",It's easy to adapt to the tap. Makes you feel safer but I'm unable to tell if the water tastes any better.
1,Bad Product,"If you have a Moen 7400, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's horrible. The filter constantly falls off. I'm returning mine and going to try a Pur system."
2,Doesn't stay on faucet,"I bought the chrome Brita faucet filter a couple months ago and ordered a Culligan yesterday to replace it. As others have said, the fitting to the faucet is made of plastic, not metal, and thus several times per week when we turn on the water above a trickle, the connection becomes loose and we get sprayed with a face full of water. I don't recall that ever happening with the white Brita faucet filter we used to have, but perhaps that was an older model with better parts. This filter is just too aggravating to use daily so we went with Culligan which supposedly has a stronger fitting, even though it only comes in white."
1,Weak Plastic Fittings,"I have to concur with the other reviewers. I've used these for over 10 years. The first iterations had metal adapters and even though the unit itself was plastic, they seemed to hold up. The one that is currently in our kitchen, for about 3 years, is just starting to leak around the fitting and sometimes, if we're not gentle with it when switching the filter on and off, it falls off.Before this started to fail, we replaced the kitchen faucet in my sister's home with the exact same unit that we have knowing that the Brita filter would fit. We purchased a filter unit for her. The plastic fitting didn't even survive installation. This is a shame as another reviewer noted, we would certainly pay a bit more for metal fittings since the ongoing revenue stream for Brita is the filters. I'll not be purchasing another."
2,Works OK at best when it stays on the Faucet,DO not buy this unless you really need some aggrivation in your life. The filter comes with flimsy parts that just don't hold up. I've had this less than a month and it's flown off of the faucet more than 5 times. I will use this POS until the filter time is up and then it's time to get another brand.
3,Shakey Start!,"When I first read about problems with the filter fitting on the faucet correctly I was leary of purchasing it. I did anyway,and sure enough as I was using it ,it would come blasting off the faucet and into the sink! After speaking with someone at customer service,I was told they would send me a metal thread adapter at no charge.Since recieving the adapter I have had no problems at all.My faucet is pretty standard,I don't understand why the just don't include it at the start as to avoid any negative reviews.I would have given it 5 stars had they given me the adapter with the filter to begin with.If you order it ,I would call right away to get the adapter, because you can't use it without it!"
1,Junk,"The plastic threads won't hold. With after three applications, the water pressure blew the entire filter unit off the faucet."
2,Brita has gone downhill,"I have been using this system for several years without issue until last year. I bought another system last year to replace one whose battery had died. The replacement system only lasted a few months (its supposed to last 5 years). The battery died prematurely. I called customer service and after doing some tests over the phone, they determined the battery had indeed died. They sent me a brand new replacement at no charge. It lasted less than a month! Same thing...battery died. I'm through with Brita. Sad, because it used to be a great product and works great while it lasts."
1,Defective,"Indicator light did not come on. Extremely frustrating, especially because Brita knows, or should know, about the problem. I am -- or was -- a long time Brita pitcher user. Wanted a faucet filtration system because I thought it would make my life easier. Chose Brita because I trusted the brand. BIG MISTAKE!!! Horrible product. Useless without the indicator light. Going with PUR. Never using a Brita product."
2,weakest link,"This product has great features, and for the first day that I used it I was happy with it, but the second day I flipped the water on and the sudden increase in pressure blew it completely off. Now I can't get it back on. If you have very low water pressure it might work for you, but don't plan on taking it on and off and try not to bump it. It doesn't matter how good a product is when one aspect makes the entire thing unusable!"
2,"Nice filter, but difficult to fit.","The change in taste of water, from ordinary tap water, is very noticeable. We were amazed and happy how much better it tasted!But it is very flimsy. I accidentally knocked against it once while washing dishes, it fell out, and I haven't been able to refit it.NOT recommmended for small sinks."
4,Slow and Steady,"OK, so the water comes out at it's own nice easy pace now... sloooooow.... at least it's nice and clean! I had lots of trouble with my New York City tap water before I got this little gadget, and now I feel a million times better when drinking what is significantly cleaner water from my faucet. It is the best bit of change I've spent in a long time!"
1,Cheap Construction,"They really need to use metal adapters and threads on the unit. After a couple uses, I would turn on the filter and the whole thing would fall right off the faucet. I guess I have high water pressure because the plastic threads were striped. No...I did not tighten it with a wrench. I went through 2 units before I gave up and bought a Pur system. Pur uses metal.Followup. I just got an e-mail from Brita. They were shocked this happened and said they would not expect something like that to happen. Then they said the would send me metal adapters. What? If you are so shocked and this is unexpected...why do you have metal replacement adapters to send out? This sounds like a known issue to me, and they only send metal adapters if you complain.So...I got the Pur filter and was not happy with the taste. I researched here and decided to try Culligan. Wow, what a difference. Less expensive, superior quality and taste. Check out Culligan."
3,Brita you're slipping...................,"Brita 42633 Faucet Filtration System, Black/ChromeThis purchase was a replacement purchase. The one I bought before this was identical, except that it leaked and kept falling off the faucet. I used plumbers tape, changed the gasket and did everything I could to make it work without success. I've never had this problem before with the Brita filter systems I've purchased, that's pretty much why I took a chance and bought another. This one went on without a problem and didn't leak, and so far one full day of use hasn't fallen off the faucet."
4,"Great filter, slight installation problem","This is a great little filter that makes my well water taste like high-quality bottled water. The problem was how it attaches to the faucet head. It's very fiddly, and it took some time to get it tightened enough not to leak without overtigtening it and having it pop off when I turned on the water. I love the filter, but have to remember not to use the pivot or I'll have to go through the whole process of putting it on again."
1,The Worlds WORST Water Filter,"This is by far the worst product ever sold by a major manufacturer.. The Unit Sprays everywhere, Drips continuously, and is confusingto use. They were nice enough to send a new unit. Nice move on their part however the new unit was just as bad as the original. I really do not understand how they can market this item since it gives such a bad name to their other products. I am changing to under the sink unit by a different manufacturer.Bye Bye Britaeye ball on you"
4,pretty solid,"this faucet system works great, if you do one extra thing... contact customer support and ask for the metal threads for your faucet otherwise the plastic threads provided will eventually break and spray water all over your kitchen in a hilarious manner otherwise it works great mine has lasted for almost 3 years and it seems like the LED indicator is no longer working"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER,"Just like everyone else has said it's a cheap piece of junk. I wasn't going to write a review, but I'm sitting here and I really want a drink of water but the filter wont hook up to the faucet anymore due to the cheap PLASTIC THREADED ATTACHMENT. Tomorrow I'll go try to find a metal one.Also it takes about 3 minutes to fill a single glass of water and I have decent water pressure. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
1,GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE!,"This has to be one of the WORST products ive ever bought, EVER! As the other reviews state, the adapters wont allow you to mount the faucet filter. And when you think you have it secure, and you turn the water on, the whole setup just shoots off the faucet. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this crap!"
2,Doesn't fit. Slow service.,"I recently purchased on of these filters. It didn't fit my faucet (a seemingly fairly standard faucet). Brita only provides two adapters in the box, which is fine if they want to save parts. They give a phone number in their instructions that buyers are supposed to call if neither of the adapters work. I called, and the machine I ""spoke"" to said they will send new parts in (a whole slew of adapters I assume) in 1-3 weeks! I don't understand why this is so slow. Hopefully it will work when they come. I'll keep spending lots of money on water until then."
4,Pretty good for the price and great and safe water taste,"I received this around 6/24/07 and I had to buy pliers to unscrew the thing from my fauce. The installation took me 5 minute because of that.The green light flashed as soon as I turned on the water. The water tasted excellent, no more like tap water. Used this for 2 weeks and still works 10/10.The speed that the filtered water comes out is pretty fast, but not as fast as normal water. I will continue to use it."
1,Not a fit,This didn't fit on my faucet. I called customer service and they sent me some additional parts and it STILL didn't fit.
1,stay away!!!,"one of the worst products i have ever bought!the ring(made out of plastic!!!) that mounts on the faucet was worn out and broke(!) before i could even get it on the faucet...stay away from this product,it's a complete waste of money.now i am stuck with a broken filter and a bunch of replacement filters i bought with it..."
2,"I thought ""Nordic"" was in reference to a European product.","I really dislike these shoes. As with anything made in China, they are inferior - especially in the size department. They hurt my feet; I am hoping they will loosen up a little so I can wear them for longer periods of time. I thought I was purschasing a product made in Europe where they typically strive for quality instead of quantity. The term ""nordic"" threw me. I have tried to wear clothes and shoes made in China, always with the same disappointments. My suggestion is that you should let people know where the product is made so they can make a more informed decision about their purchase. My bad - I will try to ask more questions next time I purchase."
4,Stimulating new ideas on causation,"Bean is an original and careful thinker. His ideas challenge refutation. Those interested in physics, philosophy, and cybernetics will find this work to be a stimulating departure from traditional views on causality."
2,Disappointed,Emblem is what I expected but will not remain on wall which was cleaned and allowed to dry before locating emblem. Scotch tape is only way to keep it on wall.Truly disappointed.
5,Baseball stickers,Thanks for getting me the stickers so quick I thought I would be waiting a long time and I recieved them rather quickly.
5,Geeeeeez,This was a gift for my Bro-in-law. I put the TIP of my fork in it....just one the tips...and my mouth was on fire for quite a while. He collects hot sauces and confirmed this is his hottest yet. I'm mexican and can tolerate heat well....but wow. It was Instant and immense.
2,Designed for portability??????,"I bought this printer with the intention of using it when traveling via plane, train or automobiles, what a concept eh?The darn thing does not come with a battery!!!!!!!! You have to order it seperately. What idiotic marketing genius thought of this configuration plan?One other thing is that you must have a flat surface for the paper to land on when it is ejected. I have had it on a car seat and the ejected paper landed on the floor, ink side down of course, and smeared. A catcher of some sort would be very helpful.Also, be prepared to change cartridges from color to b/w often. A true pain, (or waste VERY expensive color cartridges for basic correspondence)."
1,Not Road Ready,"If you travel by plane, this is not the printer you want. After 4 - 5 trips in a well packed piece of checked luggage, the sheet feeder mechanism will not feed paper. The printer still prints fine, but you must manually feed one sheet at a time. After several HP warranty exchanges, all printers ended in this same condition.I love HP products -- but this one is a real dog!"
4,HP350 review,I am happy with the printer. I just wished it would have come with a battery and cable.
1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,This is the second time I have written you about my experience purchasing this printer...YOU NEVER RESPONEDED and NOW are asking me for naother review. What is your problem????
3,Not close to good.,"This has been following suit with most MSW books. The characters are really one-sided, and Jessica is too. This story-line had a lot of potential, but it is plauged by one-dimensional beings. I would read a few more books in the series before picking this one up."
3,"Murder, She Wrote: Trick or Treachery: Trick or Treachery (Murder She Wrote)","Murder, She Wrote: Trick or Treachery is a nice, light read. It is perfect to read during a thunderstorm with a blanket wrapped around you or curling up in a big comfy chair, next to a fire with a cup of warm cider."
5,Perfection on paper,"Johnny Cash sang of a 'Tear Stained Letter'. Bill Miller's new Project is a 'Tear Stained Book'. Written with the love and passion which joined two friends together on a magical journey. 'Cash An American Man' is more than an intimate look into the life of America's greatest treasure, it is the "" High School Annual"" of Johnny's life. This book shows the mystical, spiritual, & Enigmatic immortality of Johnny Cash. Mr. Miller has given Johnny's family as well as the world a ""backstage"" view into the soul of a powerful man."
3,More difficult to assemble than anticipated,"Assembling this toy is as difficult as assembling furniture. You might be dealing with smaller and lighter pieces, but there are a lot of screws, arcane instructions and incorrectly pre-drilled holes; just like with assembling furniture.The product says for ages 8+, but I think the assembly required is quite difficult for an 8 year old, so you'll need an adult to assist the child (you should always have adult supervision). My nephew had no problems in figuring out how the pieces fit together, but he struggled with tightening the screws. He also had trouble differentiating the different screw sizes since they all look very similar. In hindsight, I think legos or toy pieces that snap together would be a better idea.After assembly, the toy looks great, seems to be pretty sturdy and should provide hours of fun.My suggestion is: if you like assembling models, get this for yourself as a small project, and then give the finished product to the child as a gift."
3,"Great model for an older child, not a toy for a toddler","I purchased this toy with the intent to give it to my toddler, but it is absolutely not a toddler toy. It is a model for an older child to assemble. I think it will be great for my son in about 5 or 6 more years, but definitely not what I thought I was purchasing."
5,Cool! And at long last Han!,I got this toy for my birthday the other day.I built it with in a few minutes and found it very cool.A cool part to it is the Han Solo figure.I would say it's worth buying.
3,Probably the least interesting of the classic Star Wars kits,"Why they even chose this vehicle over some of the others in the original trilogy I'll never know, but I was hooked since purchasing the X-Wing Fighter (still my favorite) and had to get all of the classic Star Wars trilogy kits. (The Episode One kits are not so impressive unfortunately.) The Luke is pretty similar to the figure that came with the Speeder Bikes but much more detail is added to the face this time around. The Han Solo is a bit disheveled as he appeared in Return of the Jedi after being freed from the carbonite and held captive by Jabba the Hut. (I've heard the Millennium Falcon kit will have a different Han Solo figure later this year.) Despite being a bad guy vehicle operated by Jabba's bounty hunters in the film, there are no villians and no pilot - only Luke & Han. However, once I took it apart, there were some very cool pieces that went well with the Speeder Bike pieces."
3,"great design, but no fun characters","Though this Lego set is one of the better movie replicas and it's nice to finally have Han Solo, I wonder where are the enemies guards, boba fett, or comrads like chewbacca, Lando, something to play with. Since it's difficult to get your hands on Star Wars lego characters this set is near useless for the purpose of play. While Lego is slowly developing there Star Wars line, they could atleast try to supply something to play with.Maybe they could accomplish this with more Star Wars ""location"" sets so all these vehicles can have someplace to go.But it's a nice small set to add to any collection. And if nothing else, a kid could use the blocks to make there own speeder or ship of some sort."
1,No wonder it was free,"... If I would have known that it would be this bad, you couldn't have paid me to take it.First, it makes so much noise. Whenever you turn your computer off, for about 1 minute it makes this horrible sound. I had to unplug it until I wanted to print.Second, it wastes a lot of ink. It has to charge everytime you try to make a print. I printed about 5 things over a period of 2 months. The ink was gone.Last, it takes 3 minutes to print one copy of something. Not very good unless you have a lot of spare time on your hands.Do the world some good and don't get this printer."
4,"Small, simple printer","I thought that this printer was very easy to set up. The instructions in putting together the printer were easy. Also, the CD that is included makes installing the software quite simple, and it walks you step-by-step through installing the ink cartridges (which I'd never done before). The 6 page/minute is only on the fastest speed, however, which doesn't give the greatest quality -- the letters that it prints out at this speed have lines through them that aren't colored in; very unprofessional. On the normal setting it is a little slow, but still all right. It's quiet, which is nice. Okay, after actually USING the printer, I realized that, after only owning it for two months, and printing out a minimum of materials, the black ink ran out. Personally, I don't think thata ""cheap"" printer, in price, is that great if you have to buy an expensive ink cartridge for it every other month."
1,"noisy, expensive to run",I bought this printer not too long ago .. absolutely the worst buy I have ever made. This printer is noisy .. slow .. EXPENSIVE to maintain .. (ink finishes fast .. and if you don't use it for awhile ink dries up as well) .. truly a worthless piece of machinery.Cheap design .. no on/off button .. Epson claims high resolution with this printer .. .. don't even bother looking at specs .. this unit is truly a waste of money ..Definately not a crown jewel .. or a printer .. on any standard.
3,there are better printers on the market,"""+""Great printing quality.""-""Expensive cartridges + very insensitive ink sensor.Breaks often."
4,A Good Product for the Money.,the printer works great! the prints look really nice.it is not fast. this is one draw back.the USB hook up is a plus! all in all a great printer for under $100.
5,Really cute,"I got a Pascualina for my birthday and I love it. I would recommend it to any mom (actually anybody)who wants to give their daughter or friend a really fun and useful present. Not only is it a cool journal, but theres really cute comics and lots of fun stickers. The calendar, planner, and address book are all really useful too. I especially like reading the stories about Pascualina and her family. I like the way it makes me feel when I write in it because it actually feels like I'm writing to a friend. I cant wait for 2005."
5,Pascualina- a great diary,"Pasucalina is a great diary. I don't normally keep diaries, but this has gotten me to start writing in one. Not only does it consist of a pretty and colorful diary, but it also has a planner, a list of people's adresses and birthdays, a place where you can fill in stuff about yourself, little cards or messages you can write on and give to people, over two hundred stickers with really cool messages on them (my favorite part), and more. It also has a short comic story to go along with everything else. For me, the format of the story was a little confusing because i didn't know what part came next, but it was still really good.I would definitely recommend this diary to young girls even up through their teens. It's really fun and useful."
5,Pascualina 2004: a nifty diary story,"Pascualina 2004 Rocks. Not only is it useful, but it is entertaining, colorful and pretty. There is a lot of neat little details in the corners and margins, and on the edges of the paper there are small comics depicting a long term story about Pascualina and her magical family. The story is quite interesting, and it contains a lot of humor. Pascualina 2004 has a lot of handy things in it. It contains a homework calender, a datebook, and places for phone numbers as well as places for lots of other useful information. So the Pascualina 2004 has places for diary entries as well as places for all sorts of other stuff, a colorful story and good advice (plus cool stickers!). I take my Pascualina 2004 with me all over the place because it is so useful and fun."
1,Diary Pascualina,"What a horrible book!!!I cannot believe the inappropiate language and messages being sent out. The cartoons were hard to understand and follow... it's just crazy the way religion, love, and withcraft were mixed.The book has been put toghether in a way that it's ""too baby"" for grades 7+, and it's wildly innapropiate for anyone under.The calendar/diary was the only decent part. (It was pretty cute.)The spiral binding allows for the explict parts to be exterminated."
2,Repackaging of previous sets,"Buyer beware-- a remix and match of History documentaries available in other collections. You need to research this one on the net if you have previous civil war sets. These offerings are previous releases offered up yet again. Same goes for the other recent history releases, Secrets of the Civil War, and other 2009 releases on the subject. On the other hand, if you have no other History Civil War documentaries, all are included here."
3,Same old same old,"Agree with the previous reviewer. There are some great documentaries in this set, but if you have any other history channel documentaries...you probably already have these ones."
1,Amateur Video,"If you find it hard to believe that a 5 DVD set would cost less than $20, you'll learn why when you watch the first DVD. The visual portion consists mainly of spliced scenes from old movies, a wholly inappropriate way to present history. The narrative is informative if you are new to the topic, and the text contains a few moving moments, most notably when they imitate Ken Burns method of reading eyewitness accounts, but the program lacks a compelling dramatic structure, making the overall result unsatisfactory."
2,Not a very good dvd set,"I bought this dvd set thinking I would recieve such a bargain, but I was wrong. This DVD set is not very good at all. The dvd quality is terrible! Mostly old movies with a voiceover, I found this to be distracting. The only good part of this set is that a copy of ""Glory"" was included but not in its DVD case but a sleeve. I would stay away from this set unless you want Glory with extra dvd's containing info on the civil war. Get Ken Burn's CIvil War for the best experience."
4,For the Buff on a Budget,"Not as refined, taut, or gripping as Ken Burns' work, this does serve as an excellent introduction to Civil War history. And the price is unbeatable. Consider that Both sets are of similar length, and that Ken Burns' Civil War is over $100... quite an investment. (Worth it if you can afford it, however) Though low budgeted, the filmmakers do quite a lot with stock footage, photos, and reenactments.The version of ""The American Civil War"" I purchased came packaged with a widescreen copy of ""Glory"". Which was certainly welcome as well."
3,"Liked it , but no Subtitles","I actually liked this movie even though there are no subtitles, so I could only understand parts of the dialogue."
2,The Manna Gatherer,"Motherhood is a career stange as it is unique.I have been told, by a reliable source, that nothing causes a mother sparrow to crow as loud as the initial winged voyage of her own spawn.We all love to learn the art of flight, even if only the vicarious variety.Many children are born well above the peak of the bell curve. Some are forced.In the end, some mothers are motivated by the happiness of their children; others by notoriety.My mother was contacted by the Lakewood Colorado School System with the strong advice that I would benefit from moving me ahead several grades. She thoughtfully declined.Mrs. Grost, at the behest of friends, family, local PTA and Life Magazine, when confronted with a similar request, assented.She got her notoriety.But then again, my mother loved me.If Michael Grost feels the same way about his mother, he is free to write his own book.May they all rest in peace. I know I will. So will my mom."
5,the ultimate guy book,"The husband starts telling me that the heart isn't really on the left side of the chest, it's just that the left ventricle is bigger, and why it developed that way. How did he acquire this arcane knowledge? Uncle John's ""Plunges Into the Universe,"" of course.My husband loves this book. I got it for him as gift (an entirely successful gift), and he keeps showing me things. Math Mnemonics: did you know that you can remember the order of Roman numerals (L, C, D, M) if you can recall ""Lucky Cows Drink Milk""? In this book you can also find out more than you ever wanted to know about dead-skin-chomping dust mites, the teeth of elephants, space-travel foods developed by NASA, plus the ever popular ""much, much more!""Short articles full of fascinating trivia with a lively presentation -- the perfect gift for the geek-on-the-run who doesn't have time to read more than ""Scientific American"" articles but Wants To Know Everything Anyway."
2,Strangely disappointing,"I usually love this series of books, but apparently Uncle John has a new author/editor who is bent on trying to be cute and witty, which comes off trite and boring...even distracting. I used to pick up these books without a second thought. No longer the case."
4,Fett is introduced to Lego,"This is one of my favorite sets. I love the model itself. My favorite parts of this set have to be the Han Solo in Carbonite and Bobo Fett himself. Bobo Fett makes a great lego figure. If you wanted to but this set for one reason, but it for the Bobo Fett Figure. I would say the set is lacking. Normally the Slave I is loaded with weopons. The set only has to small little cannons. You can always add them later I guess."
4,Very good.,"This is a very detailed lego of Slave I. It's pretty compact, with not many pieces just sticking out, so it's tough. I wouldn't know exactly how tough though seeing as I don't throw it around. I didn't rate this a five simply because it is not the best lego out there. This is pretty much your average lego in terms of building time and how difficult it is."
3,A Cool Toy Of Star Wars Fans,This Star Wars Craft is great!You get the Bobafett`s Space Craft with a glass cockpit and Bobafett of course.This toy keeps on breaking so you really have to keep on putting the peices back together.
3,remember the filming,set in San Francisco remember the location shooting everyday in the Tenderloin... Elisabeth was nice to all of us onlookers she signed a fifty dollar bill for me...don't have it anymore lost it in Reno three weeks later...But the movie was good...
1,could only view part of movie,"I purchased three season1 movies and downloaded them. I reviewed one so far and the season only lasted 3/4 the to the end and stopped. Tried again and again to play the season with same outcome. I tried to re-download, three times, and again only showed 3/4 of season and agai stopped same place each time. I have not tried other two seasons, however what I got to see was great."
1,London,The show did not provide an adequate overview of London. It focused too much on minor places such as restauraunts versus the major attractions
1,Can't download it,"The Samantha Brown episode is awesome. However, I bought mp3's from amazon that I can download and use however I want. I thought the video would be the same, but it only allows me to download it on their devices."
5,Dashing little sneaker,"It's the only shoe I wear when tearing up the highways and by ways of South Jersey. The thin but well wearing soles allow me to receive crucial feedback from the pedals of my wicked but still bone stock Ford Aspire. If anyone reading this aspires to own a stylish but wholly utilitarian sneaker than this is your sole, mate. -Jonathan"
1,messed up shipments,"I was purchasing this for a present. The first shipment was the correct item, but it was banged up and not packaged well enough to avoid the damage. A replacement was quickly sent out, but it was the wrong item. Unfortunately, I didn't have any more time left to give them a chance to try to correct it a third time. I found a similar item locally - and spent less!"
5,Best Instant Chai I've Found,"I've tried several chai mixes before, but this is by far the best I have encountered. I recommend making it with milk. Also, the tin suggests using three tablespoons per cup, but I highly recommend using only three teaspoons."
1,"It makes a warm milk drink, but not Chai Tea","When it comes to Chai Tea, people will like a different levels of spicy nice. This one is very low on the spice, and I couldn't taste any tea. If you put the 3 tablespoons in, there's an aftertaste, maybe from the dried milk product. Better with less mix, but then even less spice flavor."
5,Great results!,This product is amazing!! My 15 year old dog is on urinary incontinence medicine - which after a couple years had quit working. I added this natural product to her day - and it's completely solved the problem!! Can hardly believe it!!
4,"Great, but depressing","Juliana has written an excellent book on the midwifery situation in US from the 80s to today. Quite sad shape the medical profession is in the States. Thankfully I live in Canada! However, I don't really know how our situation compares concerning pre-natal care. Though, I do know we are definitely further along in our acceptace of midwives. I had a midwife and truly loved the experience.This is a great book for every aspiring midwife. And, of course, every pregnant woman wanting to control her own birthing destiny."
2,Gave me nightmares,"The book promised a positive story, but I ended up not being able to go past the first few chapters because I found her hospital stories so disturbing. I was middle of my first pregnancy and was so terrified after some torturous stories about doctors and healthy moms I went to bed shaking. I can't reccomend this book to a pregnant mother, it's too horrific. I LOVED Ina May's Guide to Childbirth. It gave the good with the bad in a loving and gentle way. It made me happy and excited to be pregnant rather then trembling in my skin about being harmed by my doctors. I had already planned on birthing with a midwife, but the images this book put into my head still scared me. The story around the ""horror hospital"" stuff I found interesting."
5,"Great explanation, easy understanding!","The author definitely achieved his goal of explaining reports, some of them more complex than others, with simple words. I recommend this book not only to people who work in the financial area, but to all kind of investors."
4,Pros and Cons:,"I think this is good for some aspects, specifically helpful in the following 3 ways1) Describes how they do they - how the numbers are gathered, what the sources are.2) Brief on if that index is useful, based on actual market actions awarded3) Includes items like the release date, and most of the time sample actual report formatHowever, it might have something disturbing in reading as well (depending on you intention)a) Explanation may be quite lengthy, a trade-off between easy to read v.s. conciseb) Keeps on repeating, repeating, repeating, and repeating saying: economic booming sign is bad for bond traders (assuming not in short position), and good to stock trades; while everything over done is bad - in virtually every index section.May need to skip some common parts, similar addressing, or lengthy examples if you want to go over what interests you efficiently."
5,great book,"I teach macroeconomics to MBA students at NYU and have read pretty much everything that's out there on macroeconomic indicators. Right now, this book is the best of the lot, in my view: good content, well written, international perspective."
1,Give me a break,I bought this player and I'm on my third one right this moment. This one has just a white screen and no picture at all. I can't believe they would dare sell this garbage. Try a diffent brand...I am.
5,"History, philosophy, and occult studies blend together","A Razor For A Goat: A Discussion Of Certain Problems In The History Of Witchcraft And Diabolism by Elliot Rose examines witchcraft in western European culture from the ninth to the eighteenth centuries. History, philosophy, and occult studies blend together in this marvelously detailed and scholarly analysis that descriptively presents critical events with a flash of wry humor. Questions as to whether some forms of witchcraft should be classified as surviving pagan cults, or linked to aspects of heretical Christen sects or beliefs are especially thought provoking. A Razor For A Goat is a welcome and enthusiastically recommended contribution to World History and Occult Studies academic library collections and scholarly reading lists."
4,Lie of 'White' Witchcraft,This is a bold look at the history of witchcraft and reveals the fiction that created the myth of white witchcraft that still persists to this day. Also includes a revealing analysis of the type of characters responsible for this deception.
4,Fun but short-lived!,"I bought this for my 9 year old son. He put it together within 1/2 hour and it was done and put away. Yes we could paint & stain it to make it more fun but to begin with, this toy was too easy for a 9 year old, in my opinion. It says for ages 8 to 11. Maybe for a 7 or 6 year old, it would be more fun and challenging, enabling them to learn to follow directions.I would like to get him a more complex set where he can spend MORE time putting it together. A more advanced set would be good. This was too easy for that age group they recommend.I am pleased with the toy's quality overall. The wooden parts were sturdy and of good quality. No complaints there. The wood smooth and can be painted or stained easily without any sanding. This set also includes a good sturdy screwdriver which is nice."
2,Return to the Island,"I think this is a wonderful book. I have only one problem with it. The author (Gloria Whelan) has Ottawas (Odawas) living in teepees. I go to a Native school. All my classmates are Native, mainly Ojibwe and Ottawa (Odawa). One thing we try to tell people is that we DID NOT live in teepees. We lived in wigwams (structures with a wooden frame covered with bark or a similar material). I feel Gloria Whelan could have researched better and prevented this misinformation."
2,Easier to not use it.,The depth setting does not stay put once you start working. The vibration from the tool running causes the depth setting to vibrate loose. I found it easier to just use the bit by itself without the guide in place.
2,Epson ink jets - buyer beware!,Epson Stylus 1160 -- I rated this a 2 because it does produce beautiful output WHEN it is working. Otherwise it deserves 0! Over the last year I have used many $$$$ print cartridges just trying to get ink to flow through the print head. After a little more than a year the printer is completely dead and print head replacement is more expensive than a new printer!! My 5 year old Alps works and family members have a 6 year old Canon and 3 year old HP which still work great. In trying to figure out how to fix the Epson my research indicates that problems with Epson ink jet printers are common.
2,Boring and bulky,"There are some neat pieces here, like the animals for the Gungans to ride. There's a small cart for storage of ""energy balls"" (clear blue 1x1 cylinders) that is sorta neat. The Gungan mini-figs are the same as the Jar-Jar ones, but in different clothes. Overall, only bother getting this set if you are working on a big Naboo display and need a bunch of Gungan soldiers."
5,It has really got the atmosphere!,"Not suprising to see this cd topping the sales chart in HK! They must have watched ""In the Mood for Love"" like me! (A Wong Kai Wai chic, cultured film...check out the OST!)Te quiero dijiste, Quizas "" "", and Aquellos ojos verdes are the best!! (Cuz there were in the movie...)Get the cd and you won't be disappointed! It kinda sounds like old shanghai in a way you know, if you people (40+) out there know what I mean! :=)"
5,Mesmering performance by a music legend,"This audio CD contains a mesmerising performance by the legendary and talented singer, Nat King Cole. His soothing style is so unmistakeable. The songs in this CD displays his charm and his beautiful and relaxing singing style does more than adding romance to these beautiful musical pieces which have stood the test of time."
4,Nat King Cole ... Mis Mejores Canciones,"I bought this solely because of the use Wong Kar-Wai made of this music in his films, chiefly of course In the Mood for Love but I was very pleased to find also on this album tracks that were featured in Days of Being Wild, a film that runs a close second to ITMFL. In particular, 'Perfidia' which is the music he uses when he pans across the Thai jungle scenery at the start and finish of the movie. The album is a collection of gorgeously nostalgic songs that resonate on many levels and bring back memories of childhood in the 50's when parents and friends played such songs on their old gramophones. It's fabulous, exotic, escapist stuff. Yes, his Spanish accent leaves a little to be desired but with a voice like that, who's really complaining?"
2,Can't get past the accent: vocal and musical,"I can't say that I wasn't warned - I read the other reviews here - but I was persuaded that his American-accented Spanish would not be an issue. What can I say - for me, his accent is an intolerable distraction. I'm not a native Spanish speaker, but I'm familiar with wonderful renditions of Mexican standards performed by Mexican natives as well as Americans such as Eydie Gourme and Linda Ronstadt, and I hoped that Cole's work would approach those. It doesn't. His excessive articulation just emphasizes how far he misses the mark on expression of the feelings of the songs. He has a lovely voice, but this performance seems misguided.The musical arrangements are woefully American-accented as well. Overall, the album is faux-Latino."
4,Not so much accent as intonation - still lovely music,"A clarification, for those who think: 'I can't ABIDE bad accents!' What people are commenting on in these reviews may be described better as a less subtle or legato phrasing than his English style, tending to over-separate words and overemphasize consonants. In listening to these songs, I don't hear any words that are 'mispronounced' by most people's standards; there simply is an overall impression of a vaguely 'foreign' sound.It does mar the performance slightly for those of us who treasure Nat King Cole for his smooth and seemingly effortless delivery. But don't let anyone's comments turn you away without listening to the samples for yourself. You may find yourself carried away after all."
4,Incredibly Vivid 3-in-1 Novella Collection,"This books is comprised of three novellas that are linked only by setting, a city called Paradys that switches era and culture from story to story. The 1st novella ""Stained with Crimson"" was disjointed and vague with uncompelling characterizations. Just a hazy vampire tale. The 2nd novella ""Malice in Saffron"" was both depraved and beautiful in a way that only Tanith Lee seems to be able to pull off. It haunted me for days afterward, this brutal tale of revenge & redemption, highlighting the state of affairs for young girls in pre-renaissance times. The characters were unforgettable, making this my favorite of the 20 or so novels I've read by her. The 3rd novella ""Empires of Azure"" was a fun ghost story, kind of in a classic mid-century scifi style, with the glamour and mystery of decadent 1920s Paris culture. Overall, definitely worth reading. Tanith Lee's writing is like candy."
4,"I liked this book, but...","I agree with everyone that says Malice in Saffron is what makes this book worth reading. The third story, the empires of Azure, is also interesting and well written. It takes you back to roaring twenties Paris, and although the time frame is more modern, it is just as well written. The first story was what tried my patience, it was a vampire story featuring Andre Saint Jean, meant to be the vampire Lestat, I think of this series, but who was also a whiny, self absorbed fool. This story drones on through page after page of prose, until it finally comes to it's meandering, sniveling end.I understand, it wasn't Tanith Lee's fault though, it was Andre St. Jean's. He just had to have his say.I still didn't like this series as much as I liked some of her other books, such as The Silver Metal Lover, and my favorite of all time (so far) Biting the Sun. I highly recommend them, not only as some of her best work, but as some of the best fantasy that I have ever read."
3,Impressive pan but some serious issues,"I bought this and initially liked it very much. It is heavy and the handle is egronomically designed to reduce arm and wrist fatigue. Is is a pricey pan, but I cook a lot and have gone through many brands of quality non-stick pans. The problem with this pan is that within about 3 months of use, it developed a serious bulge in the center. I try to never use the highest heat setting, but with this pan it seemed to make little difference. When it was unbulged, it was great, but with the bulge, rather useless and unfixable.I threw it out and have gone back to Cuisinart and Farberware, which are half the price of this and last twice as long."
4,reader,"This is a great book for students of ayurveda. Must use book with The Global Oracle also by Tarabilda. The only issue I have is, it does not explain how you know what your specific disease type is, nor can I find a book that does."
2,Not very impressive DVD,"I bought this DVD because I saw such nice reviews from many people who saw the show in China. I was disappointed that the whole DVD contains only about 46 minutes of movie and only half of the time is about the actual show. The rest of the time is about the scenery of the area with songs sung in the show. If one wants to have a glimpse of the show, he or she will be disappointed like me. The only way to go is to see the show in person in China."
1,"BUY SINGLE SEASONS, NOT BOXED SET!",Compare pricing of this 4-season boxed set available by third party sellers only w/ single seasons of Oz ($28.99 for season 1 & $27.99 for seasons 2 to 6) available through Amazon Prime. Shop Smart!
3,"yes, too high a price","Wonderful series, one of the most beautiful ever made that's making its way through Europe at last!But it's OVERPRICED!!!!!!it might be good for me now since Euro is stronger than US dollar, but I am waiting for some bargain here....( may ebay be useful )???"
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK! At over 400 pages it's a long read, but it has quite a few illustrations so the pages often go by quickly. It's a difficult book to summarize because it covers so much ground: what happened before the Big Bang, the origins of elementary particles (protons, neutrons, electrons), gravity & magnetism, the beginnings of life, human evolution (past, present, and future), religions, psychology, instinct, space travel, the fate of the universe, and so much more. This important book challenged many common ideas (or memes) that I've always taken for granted or assumed to be ""truth"" - it WILL do the same for you. So set aside your preconceived notions, get ready for a reality check, and allow yourself to explore our existence from a fresh, entertaining, optimistic, and factual perspective. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
3,Fun Beginner Level Vocabulary Builder,"This slim little 4"" by 6"" book is strictly for beginners like me. It's a fun way to learn some new Spanish nouns, and reinforce the nouns a beginner already knows. It covers 150 nouns. You get satisfaction from knowing one or three words that are common to all beginning Spanish methods, and then looking up the ones you haven't memorized yet.These are not crossword puzzles in the traditional sense. The ""clues"" are well done line drawings, and the puzzle grids do not provide squares for the articles that indicate gender (el or la).... (the articles are included in the glossary) I find it helpful to write the articles with the words near the pictures as I ""solve"" the puzzles. If you have the luxury of access to a photocopier, doing the puzzles a second time a day or a week later will make things stick.Three stars because this book is OKAY, that means good!"
5,good book,Barrett Willoughby was a family friend and included grandfather Hill and great uncle Sid Barrington in one chapter. I found the story factual and authentic.
4,world religions review,book is worth the price. great pictures and informative. not difficult to read.
1,Overpriced,This publication is extremely over priced. There are many available that are equal to and some case far superior to this guide.
2,Where is honey?,"It was hard to chew, it had uncertain test and smell... And yet, when I looked at lable, it was many other ingridients, but honey! Felt deceived. Bad, I ordered a big deal of it for the baby shower... Pity for spent money."
4,Yummy!,"This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake. Each bar is sectioned into six pieces, which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing! My only quibble is that it's sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy, as it's quite sticky."
3,Not so fresh,"While I love Bit a Honey and don't regret my purchase, I did not find them as ""fresh and soft"" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth. Maybe it's because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honey's as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time it's the bars!"
4,3 RULES TO REMEMBER,"Wow I have got to say that I have not had any problems with my Infocus LP350. I will say the bulb did go out with a bang but I had the same bulb & projector for 6 years without incident. HERE'S HOW I DID IT WITH 3 EASY RULES. 1st You have to keep in mind that there is a bulb inside and just like an old tube tv or radio you have to be paient, give it time to warm up(2-5minutes) before you get any real image. 2nd Before turning off the projector press the Standby Button on top of the unit and allow at least 10 minutes of cool down. Just like any other incandescent bulb they get very hot when turned on and the quick change in temperature from On to Off can crack the glass bulb allowing in air and burning out the bulb. 3rd when running the projector normally I focus a small fan on it to keep it from over heating especially if its in an enclosed space. Remember Warm Up, Run Cool, Cool Down"
3,Get in the Shabbat mood!,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by my own cantor's beautiful voice and her willingness to shoot for the stars musically-speaking, but I was hoping for a bit more zing with this CD. While it does a nice job on some of the songs, some sound more like Christian hymns than anything else. And, that's a bit of a letdown when we're celebrating a holiday. Still, it'll help get one in the mood at the end of a long week."
5,The White Flag by Gene Stratton Porter,This was a gift a friend and i gave a lady who hosted us on a recent trip. The gift was well received and she was delighted with the book. she is a collector of this author...very good service from the seller
4,A great contender in the photographic inkjet world,"The Epson Photo 875DC produces some of the sharpest photos I have seen. For use at home or a small office, the speed is very good, noise level is minimal, and print quality excellent.I have printed on special papers from the glossy to the matt finish and have been very satisfied with the quality of each. I have even put through heavy card stock paper, such as for greeting cards, and it works like a champ.The ability to plug in your digital camera memory pcmcia or flash memory cards is a great feature and well worth the money. Even though you require a PC to actually print, that is usually a non-issue since most people will want to do some manipulation of the photo before printing. Cropping and brightness/contrast at a minimum should be done before printing.Enjoy your new printer."
5,Don't hesitate! You'll love this printer!,"Wow! Can't tell 875DC prints on glossy paper from local photo processing...amazing color and quality! Plus it's very fast and so quiet. The built-in card reader for digital cameras makes images available almost instantly. (Includes adapter for CompactFlash cards, 9 paper samples, and paper roll/adapter for glossy 4x6 prints.)All this and it's no bigger than my old Epson Stylus 800! I'm using the 875DC with a Mac G4 but it's for PCs, too. Can't say enough about this great product!"
3,Roll paper is hard to use,"The plus side: Very easy to install (I have windows 2000, Dell Pentium II), photo quality is very good. The flash memory card reader should be very useful for many people (I don't use it because I already have a memory stick reader).The down side: the roll paper. This suppose to be a good feature. But it's difficult to load the roll paper. Also, after finished printing, you have to cut paper manually, and very carefully. If the edge is not cut cleanly - ""at a 90 degree angle in each corner"", you may have paper jam next time you print."
5,Don't hesitate! Buy it!,"Wow! Can't tell 875DC prints on glossy paper from local photo processing...amazing color and quality! Plus it's very fast and so quiet. Built-in card reader for digital cameras makes images available almost instantly. (Comes with adapter for CompactFlash cards, 9 paper samples, and paper roll/adapter for glossy 4x6 prints.)All this and it's no bigger than my old Epson Stylus 800! I'm using the 875DC with a Mac G4 but it's for PCs, too. Can't say enough about this great product!"
1,Gabriel G55518 Ultra Strut,"I purchased two of these at a spectacularly low price from Amazon. Three days after installation one of them had left a 15"" dia pool of fluid on my driveway and has continued to leak since. Gabriel told me I had to deal with the seller. I'm now looking at paying triple the original price to replace the strut and doing half the job over again. I hope the other one doesn't fail."
2,FILMED IN SCENIC SCRANTON,"This is another indie flick with a sad lame soundtrack. The movie was filmed during the winter in Scranton, Pa. It is in color, but might as well have been in black and white. This gives the movie a constant sad and despair feel by design.Manny Perez gets out of prison. He is an ex-con who killed his son's mother. He wants to go straight, but circumstances prevents him from doing so. Meanwhile his son is living in a junk yard making a living performing tricks. He meets up with Manny and wants to kill him, but doesn't.Manny wants to help his son and ends up stealing from the mob...I think you get the idea where this is going. I kept waiting for the movie to shift gears and the next thing I knew, it was over.The movie boasts a bad sound track, flashbacks, and an attempt to create art out of junk. The acting was sound, but the movie was too slow.F-bomb, quick sex scene. 1 1/2 stars."
1,Unnecessary map for sydney?,"This map is a fine map, but level of details is not better than the massive amount of free maps which is handed out at hotels in Sydney. My point is why pay for a map that you actually can get for free!"
2,Do not confuse the book with the device,"I love my pedometer, purchased after seeing Fenton in Supersize Me. I love it so much, I bought 6 Omrons in recent weeks to give to good friends. But the book - whoa! Feeble. It felt like a magazine article, pumped full of air to bring it up to the size of a book. I felt there was nothing that could not have fit into a 2-3 page tightly written article. Thank you amazon for your generous return policy!"
3,Good - but not a great deal of 'meat' to chew on,"This is a good book to get enthusiastic about walking to stay fit and lose weight. However it must be said that the book does stretch out the ""limited"" content quite a bit. I read this in one evening and was motivated to replace the pedometer that I had purchased and to get walking each and everyday. I will have to see if the 10'000+ steps a day have any long lasting weight loss effects..."
3,Good for Beginners,"Pedometer Walking is a great book, but mainly for folks who have never walked much before and who are starting out on a walking way of life."
4,"Pedometer Walking: Stepping Your Way To Health, Weight Loss, and Fitness","Pedometer Walking: Stepping Your Way to Health, Weight Loss, and FitnessThis is a great book for the first time and the experienced walker. The authors throw in lots of walking tidbits and trivia in shadowed boxes. I'm hoping my wife will find this book gets her up and walking more."
3,A little light,"I had high hopes for this book, because I love my pedometer, but was ultimately disappointed. It was repetitious and read like a magazine article, citing the same things in different ways. For someone who is just beginning a walking regime, maybe a good intro, but for an experienced walker and pedometer devotee, I can't recommend it."
5,Great pedometer book,"When I bought this book, I knew nothing about pedometers or their uses. This is a really good book. I highly recomend it. Well worth the money."
3,A good starter.,"I bought it for my mom along with a pedometer. Seems an easy read with sensible, easy-to-follow directions. Too bad it doesn't do the walking for her."
5,Great idea for getting started with making models,"This is the second of this type of toy I've purchased for my 5 year old son. I have to help get the screws started, but he loves being able to finish screwing them in and having his own screw driver (provided in set) to work with. The kit builds easy and is of good quality wood and screws as none have broken/split with the abuse its recieved. The moveable parts were done well as the tires spin easily, as does the bucket. On this model I added a bit of wood glue to most parts as my son likes to take it apart and try putting it together again, which in the case of the car version we own, results in missing parts.The wood is easily paintable as well, another thing my son enjoyed doing after putting it all together. These are very well made and enjoyable toys that younger kids can get the same thrill of putting together as us older kids do from our more delicate versions."
1,It's too bad Zero Stars isn't an option,"This CD changer has made me want to never by any product by Harman Kardon or it's parent JBL EVER! Mine suffered a malfunction after less than a year of use that would cost me more to repair than to simply replace. That is inexcusable in my opinion. I saw a response by a Harman Kardon rep before on this site saying that if the CD player was made after a certain date then the problem wouldn't show up. Mine was made before this date. Question, why was it still on a retailer's shelf? Why wasn't a recall done? That would have saved me a lot of time, trouble, and money. I would have had it serviced under the warrenty but I mail ordered it from the States while I was in Japan. However, I feel it's ridiculous to have to have such major repairs made to a CD changer after less than 1 year. Denon DCM-370 here I come. It's a cheaper, 5-disc changer, with HDCD, and can't possibly be any less reliable!"
1,Worst CD Player I ever had,"Can not agree more with the previous reviwer. My player got malfunction in less than one year. Worse, it swallowed my five CDs. I don't know how to get them out:-(. This product boasts its elf having excellent sound quality. I don't think sound query is important here if it can not even play CDs."
3,Just OK,I have read many books on this subject after having a NDE - this one wasn't my favorite. Just not that many actuall accounts with details.
2,A one-sided perspective,"Kenneth Gergen's approach to postmodern theory is one-sided and disorganized. Through a series of unrelated examples of daily life (and occasional references to the development of this new thing called ""electronic mail""), Gergen succeeds in sounding exactly like a grumpy old man down the street, waving his cane at those darn kids who step on his lawn. Much of his criticism of modern life seems to stem from the fact that it is unfamiliar to him, rather than inherently flawed. For young readers and those accustomed to the presence of technology in everyday life, most of what Gergen writes will fall flat -- unless, of course, the reader is an angsty teen trying to understand why it is they hate their life so much."
2,works temporarily,This TV was only OK brand new. One year later we're looking to replace it as it is worn out after only average use. After about three months of use it started to falter here and there. Now the picture sometimes turns to a black square that covers about 90% of the screen which you can easily fix by hitting any button but still should not be after only one years use. The sound was hardly decent quality to begin with and has only gotten worse. I cannot reccomend this item.
5,Flash Speeder,"This set is from Star wars Episode 1, I don't know why some people say it is in Episode 2, because I don't remember it in the movie. This set has compartment under the turret and comes with binoculars."
5,The Seven Sayings of the Saviour on the Cross.,"This is a must read for any student of the Bible. Pastor Pink's insights into Jesus on the cross are unique and fully referenced to the rest of the Bible. I couldn't put the book down. It was very readable and unlike many of his works, short and compact."
2,Paper handling is poor,This printer looks great on paper but we had numerous & continuing problems w/the paper handling. There was a firmware change & that seemed to help but paper keeps getting coming out in bunches & output print gets scattered & totally unusable. At times it has been a disaster.
2,Not worth the money spent,"The HP 2250 produces high-quality pictures in slightly less than the promised time. Installation is somewhat difficult (HP only provides a double-sided sheet with pictures) and various driver downloads are required before the printer will actually function (without the driver download, the paper will not feed properly). The HP 2250 proves to be tempermental and prints out a tester page everytime you need to print anything. There is a small screen on the printer, which is supposed to indicate ink levels (there are four separate ink cartidges), however, my screen remains blank. HP generally produces excellent printers, but stay away from this one. Too many glitches."
1,Whaaaaaaa?,"It takes a lot for me to put in a one-star review, but honestly, this movie was so bad on so many levels, that something must be said. I suppose I'm mostly irritated that I missed it on TCM and bought it, thinking that Maugham had authored the stage play so it must be good.It's hard to know where to start. The script is bad, the acting is bad, and in the final act an effete homosexual is introduced as a sort of deus ex machina, who is supposed to pull everything together and explain anything you didn't already understand. Now, that would be bad enough, but the deus ex machina only adds to the confusion, is on screen for no more than a minute, and explains nothing!Frankly, I don't know why this is even in print. One assumes that the epigrams from Maugham were his and not the scriptwriter, but even those fall flat. Really sorry about this, but I want the two hours of my life back. My apologies to Mr. Maugham."
1,Pass on PD Copies,Four public domain titles at bargain basement prices. You only get what you pay for - buyer beward!
2,Not worth it...,"My girls (ages 4 & 6) got these for Christmas last year & LOVED them. They loved them (1) when one of the unicorn's hooves was found broken off in the unopened box, (2) when both unicorns' horns fell off within (literally) minutes of unwrapping them, and (3) when one's entire leg broke off a couple weeks later.If your child is looking for unicorn figures to play with, this is NOT the set to buy. Even assuming the legs/hooves don't break off, the horns surely will, rendering the unicorns, merely third-rate horses."
1,Not that good,They aren't worth your money AT ALL! There manes and tails are easily pushed up and roughed up my electricty. There horns aren't glued on easily and you cannot push there manes and tails back into position. There whole body could easily be snapped in half if you pulled lightly on there sides.
3,Rosetta Stone Italian,"Innovative, informative & fun to use. Buyer should be aware, however, that this program alone (including all 3 levels) will provide only a base or supplement for learning the language and a very expensive one at that."
4,Like It,"I bought Italian Level 1, 2 & 3 a few weeks ago. I have almost gotten through level 1 so far. I am satisfied with the product. It is easy to understand and navigate. The concepts are introduced in a logical manner. It is entertaining enough to encourage countinuing with the lessons. One negative point about Level 1 at least is that sometimes it moves a bit too slow and doesn't let me practice enough on things that I don't immediately get. It offers the answers to the questions too quickly without allowing for sufficient time to think through what the answer should be. Otherwise, I think this is a very good tool to get the basics of the language.Also, I saw in some other reviews that people were not sure whether it would work with Vista. I have Vista and haven't had any problems so far."
3,Rosetta Stone,"Love learning italian, but the program seems slow in responding and sometimes doesn't pick up responses at all. Can be frustrating. However, if the program would work properly on your computer I could see it being an excellent tool to learn any language."
4,Not Mac Compatible,"This product was not Mac compatible so unfortunately I had to return it. However, the return process was extremely easy and I got my money back before I even mailed back the product. This seller is very reliable."
1,Sent Wrong Item,"I was sent the wrong item, on those grounds, I leave amazon, a bad review. Returning it was a slightly frustrating process, but the worst part was hearing that I could not exchange it for the correct product, without paying a high price.Rosetta Stone software, in general, is great and very Convenient and effective, I reccommend that, 5 stars."
1,Knock Off Item,I was VERY disappointed in this item. I have contacted the seller to receive a full refund to no avail. I thought I was receiveing a original Rosetta Stone Italian learning CD but what I got was a knock off from Thailand. Needless to say I wound not recommend anyone ordering anything from this seller.
3,Looks awesome!!! But unusable.,"I just got this watch and I love the look. You can tell the time from almost any crazy angle and the print on the watch is very large. The band has a very weird, unique design in that it buckles off-center, which seems to work very well for this watch. Though the metal clip to hold the band down is annoying while typing. It has a 100-track record which is more than enough for me and the data even allows you to modify results with distances for record tracking.This watch is near perfection. There was only one thing wrong...Every time I bend my wrist, it hits the ""mode"" button. This means every time I look at my watch I am in Chronology or Counter mode. It just won't stay in time mode no matter what I'm doing.So, I'm taking it back. I've had other Triax's before and none of them have done this. I love the look but the mode button could not have been placed in a worst spot.I'm crying, because otherwise I just love this thing... :'("
2,Band problem,"The problem with these type of Nike watches is that the bands aren't very durable and are expensive to replace. The curved display is cool, though."
5,Great book for teaching story elements!,This is probably the best book I've ever used to teach story elements. A little girl and her aunt create their own story together. All along the way the aunt introduces the story elements. I use this method to teach my second graders the elements of story telling first and then story writing. Excellent!
5,Post,This stand works great! The holes line up either box and make for an easy install. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Successful? selling with NLP,"All in all I have to say I found this book a little bit disappointing. It felt like I was merely re-reading ideas I've seen countless times before, presented in a way, that made them look new. If you're new to NLP and want to see some appications of NLP to business it might be worthwhile, but there are much better NLP sales books out there."
4,a solid NLP book for the Sales field,"As you can read on the cover, this book translates NLP-concepts in a language directed to persons who need to do some selling. If you have some NLP training and some sales experience, this book won't teach you many new things. If you don't have both, or you are looking how to apply NLP skills is a sales context, this book can give you some directions. Part 4 (""Sales management"") some stuff that does not directly relate to sales itself, but it is useful if you are a salesperson, or if you want to be come one. (extracted from my website: www.7EQ.com/books )"
3,"Pleased with order proccess. Nice pendant, but miss-matched chain.","The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. Pleased with the over all order process. The chain is a very bright silver, doesn't match the pewter pendant. The chain is also much to small and feminine for a male to wear this necklace. I Had to go out and buy a new chain in order for my boyfriend to be able to wear the pendant. The pendant is very nice though, seems good quality."
3,"Cool Pendant, but Fragile.",I love the look of this Mjolnir pendant and wore it everyday for over a year. However I had the pendant on a metal chain and over time the chain ate away at the pewter loop on the back of the pendent until it eventually broke off. So now I'm in the market for a new pendant. If you've got to have this particular one I would recommend using a cord necklace instead of a metal chain.
1,Disappointing and superficial,"Not what I expected. There isn't much detail and what there is seems repetitive of what others have written. The author, now old, may have been gifted and just have a hard time expressing herself. In any case you can do better elsewhere."
5,Great Show,How can you beat over 900 minutes of Great Tattoos!!For 20.00 I would highly recommend this
2,Not able to play the DVD,I purchased Crash Landing through Amazon that took three weeks to get to me in Wales UK. I was excited to recieve it but then after realizing it would not play on my dvd player and the only way we would be able to see the movie is by putting it on my laptop and using a HDMI cable into the tv..... a bit of a nuisence having to do all this and will view it in time as we have not had the chance do so as yet. Is there a way of changing this setting?
1,Generational warning !!,"My complaint here is the obviousness of cheap production values. If you didn't grow up on computer-generated ""action"" games, then the pathetic simulation of a flying aircraft, electric storms and crash landing, blended with real people, is just too distracting and off-putting to be enjoyable. The obvious explanation for this is a low-budget. The cheapness of production is so in-your-face that I bailed after about 5 minutes. What a rip-off. This movie is plainly intented for a demographic mega-accustomed to computerized crap.In the 1930's such crap-quality special effects would have relegated this film to worse-than 'B' status. This is no ""High and the Mighty"", ""Executive Decision"" or other first-rate airplane disaster flick. They didn't even try to achieve ""Titanic""'s computerized excellence."
1,Bible Codes Revealed,"Ms. Shriner needs to where her aluminum foil hat more often. The aliens are beaming really wierd stuff into her head. If God really is telling her all those things, then we are all in BIG trouble! Either this woman is a 'loon' or she is evil and deliberately spreading falsehoods sprinkled with truths to draw people with weak minds away from the truth in the name of God and the truth! I can't believe I actually paid for this book! What was I thinking?!! What a waste! I ripped it up and threw it in the trash. Please don't make the mistake I made."
1,Sherry Shriner not a witness for Jesus Christ,"If you go to her website (S), all you see are aliens, aliens and aliens + plus reptiles etc., aka, Junk in the trunk. I see more things in reference to Satan then of God. There is not one thing listed how to come to the Lord Jesus Christ, lifting up His name and become saved and how to know our Savior. Prophet? I don't think so, we see from the Bible what is a ""True"" prophet which she falls very short of. She is against Jews and Jesus was a Jew. She also has the thinking of a White Supremist, pure racist.A person posted if your not a true Christian you should not read this book,I say again, if you have any wisdom God gave you, read the Bible God's Word, not Sherry Shriner. God tells you what you need to know to get saved and that is through Jesus Christ and no demon or alien invasion can steal you from the hand of the Lord. Jesus said we will have trials but to trust in Him."
1,total garbage,Bible Codes and UFOs... this author clearly is incompetent as a writer so tries with tabloid sensationalism to get your $$$$. Yet another author watching too much TV instead of competent research.
1,"False prophecy, absolute gibberish, don't waste your time or money.","The author is obviously not acquainted with what the bible reveals about the fate of false prophets:Deuteronomy 18: 20-2218:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.18:21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him."
3,Streamlining Problem,"The story is great, but I don't think I will ever get to watch season two. It just will not streamline in. It is constantly stopping. I have plenty of bandwidth, so I don't understand the problem."
5,love this show,"Love this dvd set, seasons 1-2-and 3. I have been watching FLipping out for the last couple years, butthis explains a lot of the missing links. If you love Flipping Out you will love watching from thebeginning. A must buy."
4,Good Proofs Section,"Unless you want a thorough review of Geometry, this book is not it. Try the CliffsQuickReview for that. However, if you need some brushing up on geometric proofs, then this is the book. It provides clear and concise examples and all the postulates you need to know. I used this book to help with a state exam. It did its job."
4,An account of New physics,"In this small but chubby book author gives an account of history of Physics and goes into new Physics. Starts with greeks and he hates Philosophers, passes through classical Mechanics into Quantum physics with short stories of about the paradoxes and philosophical implications of Quantum Physics and into Cosmology. Half of the book with introduction and other half with Cosmological concepts. A lot of concepts are covered.Particle Physics, Quantum Vacuum, Black Holes, Anthropologic Principles.Author has a good way of explaining things.I enjoyed reading it."
4,A different Book,The title lead me to believe it was going to point out different ways to discover one's soul mate. I have read a least half of the book with out discovering this yet. a little hard to digest.
3,A nice book,"This is a nice book; not great, not life changing, but nice and a good introduction to the subject of Soul Mates and the roles they play in our lives. The book does not go very deeply into its subject, and although the author makes references to his hypnotherapy practice, the examples of Soul Mate connections given are in the form of anecdotes rather than in-depth case studies, which would have been preferable and have given the work a more serious status. This opinion, though, offers no offence to Richard Webster, who writes with great sincerity of tone. I think that anyone who enjoys reading, for example, books by popular spiritual mediums, and who would like to get to grips with the concepts of reincarnation and soul mates, would appreciate this book."
3,Decent quality!,I had ordered this for my spouse and the first order did not contain the wrist pads..I had to return the entire product but Amazon was swift and sent me another product the same day I shipped the return.
2,boring gameplay w/simple cartoon graphics,"There's Suduko, math (fill in missing # or symbol), jumbled letters, memory (fill in the cells with the correct symbols), colorex (push the blocks so the same colors ones are together), fill in the letter to complete the word, count expert (count how man symbols go in/out of the brain) & that's about it.It starts you at pre-school (obviously easy) & you get more points for the faster you go & then it levels you up as you succeed. But this is nowhere near the graphics or fun of Big Brain Academy, Brain Spa or Brain Challenge. There was no sound either, menu options are easy to understand as well as a help during play, etc.I DL a free 60 minute trial from Reflexive com, I checked for virus using Avast anti-virus & didn't get a warning. I also use Spybot & Ad-aware."
3,Detailed Celine's Life With A Little Extra Hear and There,"This was my first Celine book that I have read. I thought that it was great, but true Celine fans knew everything that the author had wrote. We want to know the untold stories, and the secrets of how Celine really is offstage."
3,Celine had to struggle to get to the top.,I thought this book was very good. Celine story is inspirational. This book tells that Celine Dion knew she wanted to be a singer at an early age and she worked hard to make it happen. She does not think of herself as a star and remains close to her large family. Celine Dion was a very interesting person to read about.
3,It's ok,It has some helpful information for building a pc but I don't think it explains everything very well. If you're looking for a guide on what to buy without fully understanding all your options and don't care to understand why it is that you are buying that certain component over other components than this will help you. If you are not tech savvy then the information that they do provide you with will probably go straight over your head. For me I know a little bit about computers and was unsatisfied with this video.
4,nice work by neal hefti,"levine's 'harlow' was a problematic film. it starred a miscast carroll baker as harlow who was all nerves and no humor. and it had bizarrely anachronistic production details, even though many of the people that were involved knew harlow and the period of films she enlivened with her beauty, carefree sexiness and distinctive speaking voice.the soundtrack is chock full of all those anachronisms that sink the film, yet on its own, it's fun light jazz 1960s style.the best track is the arrangement of 'girl talk'; and the second best is 'blues for jean'. it's not a blues, but don't let that stop you from listening."
4,Good of kind - a great main theme,"Yeah, thanks DRG. How nice to not have scratches, even though I dig the erotic smell of vinyl (oh face it, y'all do, too!)I owned this score as a kid, growing up weird, and then staged a bizarre multimedia thing at Univ. of San Francisco in the mid-80s with a bald 6'5"" African American Alvin Ailey male dancer in a strapless female white evening gown, with an orchid behind his ear dancing to ""Lonely Girl - Main Theme"". He brought down the house with his interpretation of men's favorite images of women... the images of women that men fall in love with. It brought down the house, they loved it, and thanks to the music, no one confused it with camp or drag.HARLOW'S a very dated, very cool score, probably Hefti's best, and ""Girl Talk"" is simply over the top in that bluesy mid-60s John Barry 'Petulia'style. Def worth the ten bucks!!!thanks DRG!"
4,7-Day Afghan,I have made many of these afghans and have enjoyed this book. I found the instructions and patterns easy to follow and they do work up fast. I would recommend this book to beginner and advanced knitters or crocheters. These patterns have given me ideas for some of my own creations in color and design.
3,A little bit outdated for me,"I was excited by the other reviews and bought the book, but I'm dissapointed with the 70's and 80's look of these afghans. The black and white photos do help to picture other color schemes you might like to try after seeing the colors presented in the middle of the book."
4,Good patterns for knitters and crocheters,"I both knit and crochet, so I find this book to be really nice. But anyone who focuses on one of the two rather than both may want to look elsewhere - if you don't crochet, for example, half of this book will be irrelevant to you.But, as I said - if you both knit and crochet, like I do, you'll like this book. Bright photographs accompany each pattern, and through the use of larger hook/needle sizes (usually 6.5mm and up) and two strands of yarn held together, it's suggested you could create one of these afghans in seven days. The directions are written very simply.I'm definitely going to make some of the patterns in this book. From feather-and-fan to shells to lace, from stripes to snowflake motifs to pretty granny-square styles, there truly is something for every afghan taste in this book. It's a nice addition to a collection of afghan books."
1,"Choose one, knit or crochet. Make sure ALL pictures shown have pattern in the book","I feel let down with this book, not only because of the outdated look of the afghans, but because it contains patterns for both knitting and crochet. The cover is very deceiving. I bought it for the purpose to get the pattern of ONE afghan shown on the cover. It wasn't even in the book!! I bought the hard cover version and the picture on my book differs slightly that they seemed to have changed the cover to match what's in the book, my copy show a varigated afghan in a wave pattern in the upper left corner. What a ripoff!! ...........there was 20.00 down the drain. I also do not like the fact that the front cover DOES NOT say knit AND crochet. It's fine if you are looking at this book in a store and can SEE you are buying a book with both forms, but online, you can't see the back of the book where it says knit and crochet."
2,These were okay...,"These were okay, but there are definitely better out there! Try the liners from Diaper Safari, this is the only place i can find them. They're made from rice paper-so they're softer, plus they are about an inch wider! If they only get wet, or a small amount of fecal matter they can be washed with the diapers and reused! One roll lasted me a week and a half longer than the kooshies, they also come 100 sheets per roll. We have enjoyed cloth diapers and have no complaints!"
1,SEPTIC TANK FOLKS DO NOT BUY,"I bought these upon recommendation. I read the description on Amazon and saw that they were ""biodegradable"" and ""flushable."" However, upon receipt it says on the pkg in fine print ""NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SEPTIC TANKS."" SO DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A SEPTIC TANK!! I wouldn't have bought them if I'd known and now I'm stuck with $20 worth of these...which I could return but then I'd get stuck with shipping again....which isn't going to be worth it. I guess I'll give them away. BLAH..........."
1,ricepaper liners much better,"I was very disappointed in these liners. They were too narrow and messes invariably covered the leg openings of my diapers. I also like that the rice paper liners can be washed and reused in case the diaper was just wet, these felt much more wasteful. I couldn't wait to use up the 3 roll supply I had so I could go back to the rice paper liners."
2,"Sounds great, but not a winner in my book.","When I was researching all the options out there to use with our baby's cloth diapers, this really grabbed my attention. I thought how great to have a product that would make it so easy to change a poopy diaper; just shake and flush! However, the actual product is so scratchy and stiff, I just couldn't bring myself to use it more than once. I have these lovely, soft cloth diapers to use for my little one's tender bum, and then I'm going to put this stiff, scratchy liner in the diaper? Nope! All three rolls just sitting in the closet gathering dust. If you're really interested in finding a diaper liner, try Gerber's EZ liner, they're not flushable, but they are nice and soft and can be laundered with the diapers if they're only wet and not soiled. Most of the time, I go without a liner."
4,For Earth Friendly Parents,These disposable diaper liners are great because they are disposable and earth friendly! They are incredibly soft and keep a baby's botton virtually rash-free. The only reason that I did not give these liners 5 stars is because they are not as convenient as disposable but they are worth the effort because the earth our children will inherit is worth it! Try them now!
2,What choice do you got?,"These liners are comparatively FAR inferior to Gerber liners. Two important factors: thickness and softness. Kooshies are very thick, only a super-powered flush would actually sink these liners in the toilet. In comparison, Gerber's are very very thin and despite the thinness they are perfectly effective at trapping waste yet letting moisture pass the liner and stay in the diaper, away from baby's skin. Softness: Kooshies are rough, rough, rough. They feel like that paper towel that comes in industrial rolls of brown and is used at highway rest stops or public restrooms where the lowest price hence lowest quality is of primary importance. Gerber's are soft gauze. What would you want on your baby's skin? Still, buy this because you have no choice- Gerber discontinued their liners."
2,Too Scratchy for Baby's Bottom,I bought one roll of these ready to use them with my wonderful Kushies but when I opened the package I found them the texture of dryer softener sheets. They are so rough I couldn't imagine putting them in place of the soft flannel on our newborn's bottom. I gave mine away and have found that the Kushies wash up just fine with minimal staining if you can wash the soiled ones within a day's time. Pass on these and go for the washable flannel liners to keep your baby's bottom happy.
3,Diaper Rash? Nope.,"We have sworn by these liners since our son was born. We used the Kushies Ultra AIOs for the first three months, but then switched to Fuzzi Bunz. The liners work well with both, and do help to make clean-up easier. Our baby has developed eczema which manifests itself as diaper rash and the liners seemed to be irritating him. We stopped using the liners at the urging of our daycare, but gave them another shot again after our son started on solids. As far as we can tell, the lines are not related to the rash and we haven't had any problems since. We love this product!"
2,helps with leaks but don't flush!,"These liners are good because they make cleanup easier and help with leaks if you're using cloth prefolds. However, they also scratch my baby's hiney (they are not at all soft) and i don't reccomend flushing them...they made our toilet flush slowly so I started just dumping solids and putting them in the trash."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"This book is more of an autobiography rather than ""The Wisdoms of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch"". I feel that some chapters really had nothing to do with their title. The book was also somewhat repetitive, and I thought the ending was good, but a big cliche.However, I grew up watching Seasame Street and really enjoyed hearing behind the scene facts about the show, puppets, and the people who worked on it. There were also some very heart-warming moments in the chapters. It's a pretty easy read with short chapters. This is definitely a read for any Seasame Street or Jim Henson fan, but don't expect a lot of actual ""wisdom"", just fun stories about the show and the puppets!"
3,The autobiography of the Bird,"Carol Spinney's and J Milligan's writing style is as simple and accessible as the lessons to be gleaned from the book. Reading more like an autobiography than a book of wisdom, the anecdotes are at times a bit repetitive and of marginal value. Still, the lessons that Spinney shares with us are valuable and often forgotten in our society today. Reading this book has renewed a bit of my childhood, the time when I loved Big Bird more than anything else on television. The book would have been better had Spinney spent more time on how Big Bird's character influenced his own personality, and less on the ""behind-the-scenes"" aspects of Sesame Street. Overall recommended, but don't expect more than this book promises."
5,Wonderful Read,Very interesting and enjoyable read. Funny and sad at times. A most entertaining synopsis of life as Big Bird. Highly recommend this book for any age.
4,Leopard Fist,"This is a beautiful production, and I think the best one so far in the Five Animal Kungfu series dedicated to Tak Wah Eng's art. The main form is clearly shown, and can be easily learned from watching the performer. Added to this is a comprehensive basic training set to develop strenght, and flexibility, and a few fist techniques are shown in addition. Ideally, this series should delve into just that, and show short techniques based on the animal styles that could be used for two-person drills. What is shown is quality, and the only criticism I have is that I want more of it. This DVD uses the same beautiful score as the other DVD's within this series, and features high quality editing (an advance compared to earlier productions in this series). I'm looking forward to see a Crane and Snake production!"
4,impeccable,"I borrowed this book from a colleague of mine and was glad I did. This book is impeccably researched and provides fascinating insight into the history of opium -- the cultures it created and destroyed and the effects it had on people, science and civilization. A little slow in the beginning with the biological history, but still a must-read."
5,Excellent history,This book gives an interesting history of opium and its effects both emotionally and economically on the regions of the world where it grows and is processed. A trip to Laos got me interested in the subject matter. The book is very good at giving an historical perspective on the scourage of the region.
1,whats with the type he used?????,"good god, impossible to read as the type he used to print the book in is some old type that is thick and hurts ones eyes. also reads like an old school book. really shocked that a reputable publisher would let this thing out, makes ones eyes ache : whats with his choice of type anyway???? did no one proof it and see what he was doing???? truly bizarre, ah well, there are i presume other easier to see on the page books about this topic. still cant get over it...into the trach barrel immed."
2,Too Juvenile,"I chose this book because I love stories that take place in the old tenements of New York City. From the first page of this book, I realized that it was either a young adult book or a book written by a young adult, although I do not know this to be the case. All I know is that it was too juvenile for me to continue reading it. I would recommend it for a young adult or juvenile reader, but not for an adult who is looking for a story of substance."
5,New user,"This product is an amazing move forward over existing MP3 players out there. The unit is tiny, and doesn't increase the visor size at all. I think the company is coming out with an independent energy source for the unit in November, which will really enhance the functionality. The sound quality also is much better than my Rio."
4,VERY Good,"This is a good player, compact, reliable, will not shut off after the visor has (like some others i've heard) and the softwere just can't get any simpler. I highly recomended. The only thing bad about it is that it uses your batteries up but that is just obvious. I can only imagine it on a rechargable visor, it would be a dream. The headphones are not that great but i bought me some high end ones and its sounds loud enough to hurt. Everybody I've shown it to is impressed and so am I."
1,Don't buy this disposable gadget toy.,"I got this module from a friend who bought it in January. I had been using this module for a while. It worked great until one day I found that the module crash my Visor and it has been crashing my Visor since.I had been email to Palmgear.com for the issue. It turned out that my soundsgood module was broken.Since the module was bought 6 months ago and it was over 90 days and it could not be returned. So, I asked for repairing. Then I got reply.""Sorry about that. And we nor the manufacture have a repair source to recommend.""Imagine that you bought a terrific $150 module and it had worked for only 6 months and the manufacture DO NOT CARE to repair or replace it.Good Technology is part of Palmgear.com and I knew that Palmgear.com was so infamous in customers service."
5,Terrific MP3 Addon to your Visor!!!,I just purchased a new visor a few weeks ago. I'm an avid MP3 fan and I wasn't sure which add-on I should go with. The Good Technology MP3 player is Terrific!! The portable battery pack makes it the best choice!! You can use it on your palm pilot or as a stand alone MP3 player!!! I love it!!!
1,First try DOA,"I know it's a bit unfair to judge a product I haven't yet used, but there is nothing worse than unwrapping your highly anticipated purchase, reading the instructions (""..so easy!! Just plug it in!!!) and finding out that the thing is dead right out of the box (nice case though).So, it's RMA time. It's going back, and I'm going to have to wait a couple of weeks to see if they can get it right next time.One very annoying bit of info: the toll-free support number has been replaced by a toll call to Palm Gear (9 to 5 CT). Rather than play games, I ran through all the diagnostics in the troubleshooting links on the Palm Gear site and still got nothing. It's packed up and going back tomorrow.Assuming that my Visor is OK (everything else works, but I've not tried a Springboard module 'til now), I guess I got unlucky.Hopefully, I'll have a happy story when the replacement arrives, but, for now, I'm not impressed with the unit or the support. Add the short warranty period, and now I'm nervous."
3,Split decision,"What we have here is a woman's life spanning just over 100 years. Lilla is not a particularly likeable woman, but if you digest the details you can see why (possibly). She is an interesting woman who weathered particularly exhausting situations and managed her life so that she did what was expedient.This book has numerous photographs.The book isn't well-written or edited. That aside, the details of survival, one way or another, are quite out of the ordinary and at times fascinating. It became even more so when I realized I had actually seen this cookbook when I was lucky enough to come across it several years ago at the Imperial War Museum. It was a nice , unexpected connection. And I have never before read of the Japanese prison camp existence within China. An easy read of eras gone by."
3,Interesting history and character research,I'm only 3/4 of the way through but it's a bit too gushy for me. Can't imagine the author's obsession with her great grandmother and her reaching to fill in all the emotional blanks but it's interesting all the same.
5,Trumpette Ballet Socks,"I gave these socks as a gift, so I can't firsthand speak about the quality after washing, etc. However, my friend tells me they wash up well and are perfect for an infant (rather than wear shoes which aren't really recommended until they are walking). I love all the colors."
5,Adorable!,I love the socks! They are so cute and actually stay on unless she is trying to chew on the bows! I have received tons of compliments:)
5,Great Gift,"I gave these socks as a baby present. Since then, I've gotten lots of wonderful emailed pictures of socks in use. Mom and twins are happy. I'm happy. They're terrific!"
1,Not as advertised,"The Amazon description of this lamp said it had a 300 watt halogen bulb, just what I wanted. When the box arrived, it said in clear letters that the lamp was only 180 watts. I contacted the seller, who said the 300 watt bulb can no longer be sold in California. I was given a free shipping form to return it. I still had to pay for the repackaging of the lamp, another $20."
1,Beware - missing parts - major hassle.,Don't buy from this manufacturer. The box was missing the entire stem of the lamp. Major hassle to return due to size and weight.
1,Poorly made,"After trying for three hours to assemble this lamp, I gave up. The threads in the pole that connects to the lamp arm were poorly machined, so it was impossible for the arm to be inserted onto the pole properly. On top of that, the small lever that holds the arm in place when the lamp is finally assembled fell off, because it was too big for the part of the arm it is supposed to attach to. So the lamp was unusable. The only good thing about this purchase was that I got a full refund. It is not a well-made lamp."
3,Near miss,"My five-year-old really likes this game, so don't count it out. The concept (stomping play-dough monsters with a giant foot) is very appealing, and the artwork is detailed and cute. However, I had expected a mini monster factory, since making and destroying monsters is pretty much the whole point of the game. Not so--it comes with a single mold. We improvise by making our own freestyle monsters. Gameplay is very dull--your token moves in a circle around the board so aimlessly that it is difficult to remember where you left off. This game could use some minor strategy to make it truly fun for the WHOLE family."
5,My 6 year old loves this,"This game is ideal for kinesthetic learners. I have 6 and 9 year old boys who are highly hands on learners. They need games and activities that are kinesthetic and active. The highlight for them is getting to make the clay monsters and ""stomping and squishing"" them."
2,DIDN'T LIKE THIS,"I GOT MY SON THIS LAST YEAR JUST KNOWING HE WOULD LOVE THIS AS HE LOVES TO HIT AND SMASH EVERYTHING!! THE DOUGH WASN'T EASY TO HANDLE AND THE MOLDS WEREN'T VERY GOOD. I EVEN JUST MOLDED SOME MONSTERS OF MY OWN OUT OF PLAY DOUGH AND USED PLAY DOUGH MOLDS BUT HE WAS JUST NEVER INTERESTED IN THIS. I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA FOR A GAME AS MANY KIDS WOULD LOVE TO ""SMASH"" THEIR OPPONENT BUT I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH ACCESSORIES AND I DIDN'T THINK THE GAME WAS THAT INTERESTING EITHER. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT."
1,dON'T OFDER FROM THIS COMPANY,"I ORDERDED, THEY TOOK MY $$$ AND NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN, I AM DISPUTING WITH MY CC COMPANY, TOTAL MESS DEALING WITH THEM"
1,POOR QUALITY,THE POOR QUALITY OF THE SOUND TRACKS(WHICH MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR) IS ONLY EXCEED BY YOUR TERRIBLE SERVICE IN MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBE TO MAKE A RETURN.
3,Informative and Entertaining,"Great issue for those who understand the fundamentals of the market. Not recommended for the novice investor. Good tips for investing, though not all the tips will apply in every case. Book tends to highlight the importance of investing in good companies with very little review of market analysis."
2,Cake Eyeliner,"I've used this product for many yrs and loved how easily it glides on and stays on all day. But, they must have changed the formula (or I just received a bad one), now the cake won't absorb the water as it should and makes it almost impossible to get it liquid enough to brush on your eyelids"
2,Disappointing!,"Like other reviewers, I am dismayed that some of my favorite cake eyeliners have been discontinued. However, I was encouraged by the many positive reviews I read about this product, so I ordered it from Amazon.I found it to be difficult to mix with water to get the right consistency. It also doesn't have good staying power; if I apply it on my lower lash line it ""melts"" down into my undereye area, making me look sick and/or like I haven't slept in days.Then I noticed that one of the main ingredients is talc. Talc has been called a carcinogen by many groups due to its similarity to asbestos, but it seems controversial. It is indeed in many products but that doesn't mean it's safe. The cosmetics industry is not as thoroughly regulated as foods and drugs.All in all, my experiment with this product was a flop."
1,"""Sponge"" Eyeliner","Don't waste your time or money on this product. Your brush will soak up this cake eyeliner like a sponge. Didn't stay on and flaked like crazy. Always remember ""you get what you pay for"", and this eyeliner is a perfect example. Didn't even come close to the quality and application of the now discontinued Maybelline and Mary Kay eyeliners. Great customer service, however."
1,It's awful,"The product is so porous, it simply won't apply really black. (Mary Kay used to offer an excellent cake eyeliner, but it's no longer available. I'm trying to find a replacement.)The packaging of the Fran Wilson liner is nice - that's why I gave it one star - but the plastic cover on the application brush WOULD NOT come off! I tugged and tugged, and pulled the bristles from the handle. Then I tried cutting it off. Finally, I threw the brush (which is teeny-weeny, anyway) in the garbage.Huge disappointment."
3,It's a ok product.,Does not go on smooth.. it's a pain to get enough product on the brush to make a clean straight line.
4,Cake eyeliner,"this eyeliner is fine, all cake eyeliners run, this one is an eyeshadow too that goes on smooth, so a double bonus. I would purchase again."
5,Just what I needed,"It's hard to find black cake eyeliners that wear well... I may be old fashioned, but you need cake eyeliner to get real cat eye perfection! I've used Fran Wilson for many years and it has never disappointed me."
2,did not stay on,WHen my eyes watered it came right off. no staying power at all. Went on easily but I will not wear it again
4,Good Boards,"These are great cutting boards. The gripper feet keep them from sliding across the counter, which is a good thing when you have a sharp Santoku in hand. I have white cutting boards that are stained and old, so these are a welcome addition. My kitchen is golden yellow with accents of red and apple green - I bought the green boards here, and the color is a perfect compliment to my kitchen. I plan on leaving the larger board out next to the stove to use on a daily basis. The smaller board is a good size for cutting lemons, and making my kid's sandwiches for school. All in all, I'm very pleased, and would recommend. The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5, is that the knife marks tend to show up a litle more than I'd like. I'm sure this is due to the color -- on my old white boards, the marks weren't as noticeable. No big deal, though."
4,Is it black or brown?,"These are super-cute shoes but I expected them to be a more true black; the black almost looks brown, so wearing them with black pants looks a little odd. Still, they're a lot of fun and fairly comfortable for a high heel."
3,Heartwarming Anecdotes By a Southern Gentleman,"The author of this book was a warmhearted and clever gentleman of the sort you don't see anymore. This trip down memory lane, spiced by funny and wry humor, will delight any admirer of wit and joie de vie."
2,Not So Good,This is not one of Jack Higgins best. The Story was too long and plot was terrible. The ending was very confusing. Read Khufa Run instead.
4,it was alright,"It was an interesting project for Mallory and she's lucky to have met her favourite author and work for her, but it was kind of dumb of her to get mad at her for not writing from her life just because she had a rough childhood and her books did not reflect that. I give it 4 stars though because the book was well written descriptively and the ending was a very good one"
4,No worries.,"Takes the worry out of paying by credit card. Costs a few cents more compared to the monthly fee, but you get three months of play without worrying about your credit card balance."
2,sucks it up but a piece of junk,"why can't someone make a product like this out of strong, durable parts..it would be such a great concept to be able to vacuum up all the small leaves and debris.This does suck it up...but the product is basically a piece of junk that will be broken in a few months for sure."
1,totally out of work after using it in two minutes,"Hi there,I am a international buy in Sydney, Australia. When I receive it today, after two minutes using for the vaccumn, it smoke and totally out of work. Since the internation shipping fees will be expensive more than $500, I just want to make sure, can I get a refund for the item, I can send you the picture if you like.Could anyone tell me how to get to the refund?"
5,Much better than a broom,"This little outdoor vacuum works great. It is small enough to maneuver into tight spaces and around objects. Yet, it is powerful enough to do the job. I use it to pick up leaves and other debris from my walkway and large driveway. I was surprised that it even picked up trash on the edge of the unit. The vacuum has two height adjustments so you can set it slightly higher when your pile of fallen leaves is a little too high. The 8 gallon bag blocks most of the dust unlike other outdoor vacuums I have used. If you have 20 trees that drop their leaves in the fall, you will need something much bigger. But, for small to medium walkways and parking lots this vacuum will do the job.Pros:Good suctionLight weightManeuverablePicks up along edgesCons:A little loud"
2,Loud and kickstand issue,"This vacuum is significantly louder than my wet/dry canister shop vacuum and the kickstand is poorly designed with the result that the vacuum tends to fall over, as other reviewers have said. It doesn't pick up debris on smooth concrete as well as a standard indoor upright or a canister shop vacuum, and always left fine dirt on my garage flooor that I was tracking into the house. I find I always reach for my canister shop vacuum instead, so I ended up throwing this vacuum out. It looks like a great idea-- and for some kinds of debris it may be-- but it was an expensive failed experiment for me..."
3,Shop-Vac,"I like my Shop-Vac, but it does have a few problems: It jams a lot, the rubber ring doesn't stay in place very well and you have to keep holding down the trigger to keep the vacuum running. I do however think the vacuum does a good job, it made keeping up with the falling leaves a lot easier and I would purchase again."
3,shopvac i/o sweeper,"this is an OK sweeper but cheaply made for the price. The latch for the collection bag was broken on arrival; packaging for shipping was substandard. The vac works fine, so far. I have a 300 ft. concrete driveway-sweeping with the vac is still tedious, but far, far better than a push broom."
1,Warning!,"After using the Shop-Vac 4040010 Shop Sweep Indoor/Outdoor Vacuum for less than an hour, we noticed that the strap holding the collection bag to the handle had already torn--or come unsewed. Hoping that I might be able to get a new bag, I called Amazon and was told just to return it. I am still in shock. It was a lot of work to assemble it. Now to think about disassembly and repackaging is just too much today!"
3,shop vac,"the shop vac works well on gravel picking up stuff and, leaving the gravel in place. clogs up on pine needels but, works very well on picking up leaves off pavers. handy in the work shop picking up sawdust. It gets into corners really good and, the collection bag doesn't let any dust out. The kickstand needs some improvement. I really don't see why it should cost so much."
1,Boring,Book was boring and there was nothing new in it that I haven't read in other books. Save your money.
1,Not all it was cracked up to be,"I bought this book solely based on the other reviews posted here and I am sorry I did. It was generally a waste of my 10 bucks. There was nothing new or especially ""fresh"" about any of the humor and - frankly - it got very boring about half way through. Letters A and B made me laugh, but the remaining 24 letters fell flat. I found it to be mean-spirited in some cases and felt like I was reading the author's therapy sessions in others. Don't buy this book. Others have written much better on this exact same topic."
2,Problematic poetry,"I greatly sympathize with the writer of this book, and appreciate his inspiring courage. I just had a hard time getting through the poetry bits."
3,NOT HIS BEST,"Joselito made so many films demonstrating his wondeful voice range, and beautiful songs. I was a little disappointed in ths film, but still love him. I wish more of his better films were released. If you enjoy Joselito, this film was OK. It seems that the films he made in Mexico were a lot better. I love ""EL CABALLO BLANCO"", and ""LAS ADVENTURAS DE JOSELITO Y PUGARCITO"". They contain a lot of my favorite songs, and display great humor. I'd like to see more of his films."
5,A Gene Autry movie starring Roy Rogers,"A dispute between Autry and his stidio launched Roy Rogers carrer as a star. Under Western Stars is what I call a New Deal western, and Autry made several of them. The themes concern ranching and other out of doorwestern businesses, and attempts by Roosevelt to change and modernizecertain traditional but harmful methods. This one concerns itself with the need for federal conrol of water usage in the West. The song ""Dust"", effectively used in the story, waswritten by Gene Autry and may well be his best. I rate it with Cool Water and Tumbelin Tumbleweeds. After Autryreturned to the fold, Rogers went on with straight westerns, not musicals."
1,Alpha Video edition not recommended,"This rating applies to the Alpha DVD only, not the film.The Alpha Video edition of UNDER WESTERN STARS (1938) appears to be uncut at 64 minutes and 48 seconds, but the picture quality is so bad it's hard to enjoy, and there is a large, annoying watermark in the upper right corner that pops up occasionally. In comparison, the Sinister Cinema DVD-R is derived from a better, sharper 16mm source and is also uncut. Roy Rogers fans will be much happier with the Sinister Cinema edition."
4,Under Western Stars,I liked the plot of the movie . I never liked the style of the hat Roy used in these early movies. I always have been a fan and have many of his movies and TV shows .
5,Kissin's pictures,"This is the finest piano interpretation of the Pictures I've heard. This 2001 recording of the no longer child prodigious shows the maturity and the assurance of the genius that was here to stay. The recording is superb, with the airy and presence of a live concert. This is a must have CD."
3,"Good book, Muslim reader","I believe the author put a lot of work and sought to understand Islam. The author himself forgot the challenge and the Miracle of the Koran which is, writing a book like Koran; If the author wrote a book like Koran, the Miracle of Islam would be challenged and proved wrong. Yet he did not. I think the author forgot to mention scientific facts mentioned in the Koran, ex, it is stated in Koran that Seas and rivers don't mix when they meet. This can be observed in (Baltic and North Seas) also (Rhone and Arve Rivers in Geneva, Switzerland), and in Germany too. The author was trying to prove Christianity is the divine religion; He didn't mention scientific facts whic prove Koran is a divine book."
5,THE COAL TATTOO,"SILAS HOUSE IS AN INCREDIBLE WRITER. HIS CHARACTERS LIVE IN MY MIND AS I READ.I FOUND HIM THROUGH AMAZON, AN THEN REALIZED THAT HE ALSO IS A DJ ON ONE OF MY FAV COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS: wmmt FM RADIO, OUT OF WHITESBURG, KY. THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS IN PART WHY HIS WRITTEN WORDS HAVE THEIR OWN RHYTHM AND MELODY.AS A TRANSPLANTED KENTUCKIAN, I LOVE TO READ ANYTHING BY THIS AUTHOR WHEN I AM HOMESICK., HE TRANSPORTS ME BACK HOME IN MY MIND WITH HIS WRITING."
4,Enjoyed it,"I liked this book, the characters were good, though I didn't think it was as good as parchment of leaves, which I wish I would have read first."
4,Bought as a replacement,"I was loaned this book by a friend and read maybe 1/2 of it. Sorry to say, it wasn't my cup of tea. But before I could get it back to him, we had a flood in the basement and it got ruined. I bought this as a replacement. The company I dealt with was quick and had good service."
3,Good but not as good as all the reviews,"After reading so many glowing reviews on Amazon, I purchased ""The Coal Tattoo"" While I was never bored reading it; I did not feel an emotional connection to the characters. I also did not get the insight into the land that they lived on and wanted to protect. I did get the story of two sisters that no matter what stick together. To me the book was worth reading, but not worth the 5 star reviews I have read. I thought ""Baker Towers"" was much more meaningful to the mining industry. This is more of the story of two sisters. A touching story, but not the best book I have ever read."
2,Campaign Press Release or Biography,"Perhaps my view can be attributed to the inherent skepticism of being a Philadelphia sports fan, but the tone of this book rings more like a political endorsement than biography. It's very thin on Bunning's early life, devotes very little space to his time with the Pirates and Dodgers, and spends an inordinate amount of time on the campaign trail. About the only time I got a sense of the real Jim Bunning was in the chapters devoted to his minor league managing career. As the Phutile Phillies were apt to do during Bunning's career, Dolson doesn't get enough run support and does an admirable job with very thin material."
5,BREATHTAKING,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF MR. BRYSON AND HIS WORK SINCE HIS "" REACHING FOR THE SKY"" ALBUM. ""UNCONDITIONAL lOVE"" IS BY FAR HIS BEST WORK YET!!! IT IS MY FIRM OPINION THAT MR. BRYSON HAS NEVER RECEIVED THE ACCLAIM HE DESERVES. IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVILEDGED TO HEAR HIS MUSIC, THEN YOU HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME; A TRUE ROMANTIC AT HEART, YOU WILL THOROUGHLY ENJOY HIS LATEST CD AND ALL OTHERS TO COME. IF ""UNCONDITIONAL LOVE"" IS AN INDICATION OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MR. BRYSON IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL ALL BE THE BETTER HAVING LISTENED. MANY ARTIST COME AND GO,BUT LONG AFTER THE FADS WILL REMAIN THE SOULFUL AND ANGELIC SOUNDS OF PEABO BRYSON.""YOUR HEART IS MY HOME"""
4,Great Guide and Reference,Father Randolph gives a great overview and understanding of this sacrament.If you have been away from confession for a long time this would be a good book to give one confidence and knowledge before seeing the priest on this vital sacrament.One thing I really liked was that the book addresses various priests who encourage or discourage the sacrament and recent developments since Vatican II.Father Randolph gives a lot of foundation and background of church history for one to reflect on. One of the better books on confession I have.
2,"Good feel and accuracy, poor longevity","This mouse OK wireless range and good accuracy, but after 9 to 10 months of moderate use, the scroll wheel quit working. The side buttons work at random and the software control program that came with this mouse is so dumbed down that it is useless. This product worth maybe $15, not $30."
4,No problems here,"I had absolutely zero problems installing this device. If you follow the directions it's very easy. Be SURE to leave your computer ON disconnect the old mouse and plug in the reciever. It was that easy. I am running XP pro,not sure if that made anydifference or not.I installed the software as well to gain access to button programming.As for the on/off button,it shuts itself off after a few minutes so don't worry about having to grow long nails.I did find the right button difficult to use. It is in the wrong position. Not good in a fire fight online.They could have added weight adjustment to this mouse and made it a bit ""slicker"" in the bargain. A good gaming pad will solve this but they cost as much or more than the mouse did.Price is right on this one. I you want a truly high performing mouse it will cost you twice as much without twice the benefit."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I bought this product thinking it was better than some of the others on the market. Boy was I wrong. I installed it, and then it didn't work. Then it messed up my computer! I consider myself computer savy, but my touch pad is now faulty and won't scroll. I have tried everything to restore the previous settings, but this product screwed up my computer. I want my money, time and old computer back! BTW, if you get this product and windows gives you a warning about it, Don't install it! Beware!"
3,Journey Back to Oz,A wonderful childhood memory with a unique collaboration of classic performers.Story could have been better.
1,FORGET IT!,"This belated animated sequel to The Wizard Of Oz is unoriganal, unimaginative and has a distinct lack of the feel good factor that made the Judy garland version so superb. Only links with the origanal film here is the voice of Dorothy which is provided by Liza minnelli, daughter of Judy garland. The story goes pretty much the same - Dorothy is transported over the rainbow by a cyclone and is reunited with her old familiar friends. Animation is fine, its just the lack of any real exciting adventure that lets the whole thing down. The film was actually made in 1964 but it took an incredible 10 years for it to be finally released - watching this only makes you realise why. Young children may be enthralled but lovers of the Oz books will be disappointed."
3,OKAY,HOW DO I RETURN THEM BECAUSE YOU SENT ME TWO OF EACH AND I ONLY WANTED ONE. THERE ARE NO DIRECTIONS OR RECIEPTS WITH IT.
4,only one person can sing a elephant never forgets,as Ethel cansad I brought memories of the Saturday afternoon at Norwood cinema
5,GREAT! A TRUE CLASIC!,"This film is completely star studded, see it! It's hard to come by, but it's a truly heart warming film. It shows the true bond between Dorothy and the Scarecrow. Oh, and if you like this, you'll love the Wizard of Oz cartoon series that ran in the early 90's. It's on toon disney at 4:00 a.m. every sunday and monday mornings. I tape it every week!"
2,Not at all what I expected,"A bit too corny. There were a lot of good points and explanations given, but I expected it to be much more comical. Okay for a coffee table book."
3,"It's ok, but there's a better version IMO which is free","This version prefers simplicity but it loses some aspects of the another translation I found which is free. Find the Ashtavakra Gita Translated by John Richards. IMO it's just as good as this one, if not better"
4,Making the best out of nothing,"Highly simplistic storyline made into a damn good ""B"" movie! Preston's wife Emily has an affair with Jonathan and from there on, EVERYTHING goes wrong! At times, this movie has that ""L.A. Confidential pulp-type"" feel to it which make it quite right especially when Preston goes to visit a private investigator. He turns out to be, well, let's say, not too conventional in his techniques. A non-Hollywood ending which, of course, will give it that ""flop"" status. Could be better but I must commend Jon Bokenkamp on his efforts. Flick stars Luke Wilson, Norman Reedus, Dennis Farina & Mili Avital. Worth a watch!"
5,For any Parent: A Must Read,"I love this book! Alan Loy McGinnis provides us with sound, proven and empowering principles--which can be used to motivate people to be and do their best. If you are a coach, teacher, manager or parent this book for you. It's loaded with practical advice and GREAT stories-which make it an enjoyable and inspirational read. Highly recommended.Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
4,Very Insightful,This book is great for people who want to interact with people. It is for people who would like to convey things but end up somehow sending the wrong message. People who were taught myths on how to interact with people will find this book handy. I am glad that this book relates many of its findings to the teachings of the Christ and backs it up for skeptics using the latest research.
5,Wonderful,"In my opinion one of the best albums of heartfelt songs ever produced by anybody, by an often underrated artist."
4,Solid folk album,"Ron Sexsmith is definitely one of Canada's musical treasures and it's quite unfortunate he hasn't gained more exposure in Canada or abroad. Fortunately, Ron has a cult following and I am quickly becoming one. Ron's songs are always melodic and beautiful and his lyrics are pure poetry. Ron is one of the few musicians in todays music who write from the heart and always have something important to say. Fantastic artist all around!"
3,A great leap sideways,"This album suffers by comparison to Other Songs, and it's a shame, because it's really hard to hit two grand slams in consecutive at-bats, if you'll excuse the baseball metaphor. There's nothing here to match Strawberry Blonde, Pretty Little Cemetery or So Young (to name but a few), but there are many nice moments to be had; and some listeners may even like this more because the subject matter is a bit more upbeat and more fleshed out instrumentally...more listener-friendly and geared toward the mainstream. Cuts I particularly liked were the melancholy but hopeful Still Time, the stately and melodic Riverbed, and Right About Now, which is almost soul. All in all, I recommend this album, because Sexsmith is a major talent and even his mediocre stuff is better than some people's best...but I think Whereabouts is a step sideways and hope he can top this one next time."
4,Deep rich beautiful!,"How happy I am I discovered Ron's music. Just an excellent release and I'll soon add his other's. Strong songwriting through-out - melodic, holding up to many listens. It is his voice that brings me back again and again. I even heard one song off this CD on tape at my grocery store! Does this mean fame is arriving for him? Beautiful record."
5,Excellent,"You can't go wrong with this monitor. If you have anytrouble reading text, just hit the auto button and allwill be well. No dead pixels and excellent graphics.You want the best price then go to newegg. They havethe best prices and sometimes free shipping and if notthen very reasonable shipping. And excellent customer service."
4,A Great Value,"This monitor was my first excursion into the LCD market, and I am not disappointed. The image quality, sharpness, and brightness rival any CRT and the contrast is decent. Compared with the laptop monitors I've used, this Samsung is somewhat harsher on the eyes as it is more crisp. Of course, if you're using Windows XP, you'll want to use its ClearType font smoothing. In terms of latency, I can see no difference between this screen and a CRT. The Auto Adjust button is great for quickly setting up the screen's geometry. While the footpring is small, the base is slightlly unstable. Also, my monitor has a dead pixel in the middle. However, what matters most is image quality, and you will be exceedingly pleased with this LCD."
4,Among the better LCD monitors,"We took 10 of the 151s for our Internet Café.For 2 reasons we have chosen LCD screens over CRT monitors:Having a monitor running 10 hours a day adds up to the energy bill, and LCD monitors consume essentially less power than CRT monitors.Second, the space it takes on the desk is much less than what a CRT demands.Samsung has a good reputation for LCD monitors (somewhat less for CRT screens). The dead pixel rate is really low, and the color rendition and image definition is in the better range of the LCD marketplace. Overall, this monitor is an excellent deal when looking at the price-performance ratio."
3,Urban Prey Species,"This book does a fairly good job of documenting the mental attributes of our most prevalent urban prey species, ""homo semi-sapiens wimpus"". The treacly, sentimentalized vision of ""nature"" espoused by the urban bleating grass-eaters in Boulder is a clear demonstration of the need for accelerated Darwinian selection by the larger carnivores. I would fully support a Dept. of Fish & Game relocation program designed to move cougars, black bears, and grizzly bears into the urban parks and backyards of the homes of the bleeding-heart leftist wussies who inhabit our larger cities. After all, the urban lefitsts are herbivores, the natural prey for large carnivores. Chomp down, dudes!!"
5,A must read.,"Wildlife protection and urban infringement have changed man's relationship with nature. Today, no area is safe as habituated animals adapt to city life. Mr. Baron does an outstanding job of explaining our association with wildlife, and provides a startling glimpse into our future. Entertaining, and informative, I highly recommend this book."
2,Dreary book,"Overall, pretty boring unless you live in CO. There are not many places where mountain lions are relevant any more."
5,About 43mm filter,"Just to correct previous reviewer: how to attach 43mm filter or add-on lens (from the manual):""When you want to attach a Tele Conversion Lens (not supplied) or a Wide Conversion Lens (not supplied), be sure to first remove the lens Hood by turning it counterclockwise.""I removed lens Hoood, attached 43mm filter and putted Hood back."
5,Cheerful,"This was a gift for a person in the hospital and preparing for a long haul to get better. It was the best gift you can give as, no matter how much you do not want to laugh, you laugh just reading it. Remember, Laughter really is the Best Medicine."
4,Overlooked little gem,"I was surprised that no one had written a review of this book before me. It is an excellent little gem about the last Avignon pope, and his victories against Milan and Florence in the fourteenth century. Concise, short, well-researched, well-organized, easy to read, this is everything a history book ought to be. It is a shame that this slender volume has been overlooked."
2,8 out of 12,"I purchased 12pk OLB3 baseballs and just arrived today.However, 8 out of 12 balls are terrible - balls have not good stiches and few dents on its surface.I know I bought at cheap price, but I cannot satisfy with the condition of balls (I know Rawlings is the best at baseballs).I hope the seller would be more careful with keeping their stocks so that future buyers can satisfy with their purchase."
2,good only for pitching,"These balls are trash. They fall apart after being hit a few times with a wooden bat. They however are good for pitching, my curveball, slider, and change up have great movement with these balls. Yet they do not carry off the bat and they fall apart easily, so it is not worth the money, even though they are cheap."
3,You get what you pay for,This is a good product if you don't really care about the quality of the balls. These are like those stupid all weather balls that have absolutely no pop and sound dead. Positive was they were cheap. A lot better than paying $100 for q bucket of 16 balls.
4,Everything and More (or Less),"It sounds like Bruce was trying to take his brilliant ""Breakfast in New Orleans, Dinner in Timbuktu"" a step further with this latest work. And while this one has some truly shining moments (""Open"" and ""Don't Forget about Delight"" shine brightest), his attempt to raise the bar is too often verbose, undermining the lush, trancy melodies. I understand that he views the world as being in peril--and there's a lot of evidence to support that--and he's doing all he can within his medium to help the situation. Unfortunately, he's likely to turn off all but the already converted with a few of these tunes. I salute him for working with a higher degree of difficulty than 99% of the musicians out there, but I can't help but wish for a smoother ride."
3,Heaven's Perfect Alchemy,"Bruce Cockburn's 2003 CD ""You've Never Seen Everything"" has some good moments. ""Put It In Your Heart"" has a driving beat, an addictive arrangement and a passionate vocal, ""Heaven's perfect alchemy put me with you and you with me."" ""Wait No More"" is a very good track with a repetitive guitar riff and Middle Eastern touches, ""Sipping wine with the angels in this torch-lit tavern by the sea, What does it take for what's locked up inside to be free?"" Other tracks like ""Celestial Horses"" and the closer ""Messenger Wind"" are also excellent. Not each track qualifies as stunning. However, there are enough jewels to make this welcome earplay! Enjoy!"
1,"Another ""I Hate George Bush"" Song by Bruce","Bruce is angry. But you knew that. It's no surprise - he's always angry lately. Here's a man with a mastery of words who can't get through an album or a concert without resorting to profanity. Memo to Bruce: SHUT UP. We understand that you don't like George Bush. Do we have to hear about it every album and every concert? Not only does it alienate many of your fans, but it's bad art. We're tired of it. Let it go. Take your own advice at kick at the darkness in yourself. Put that in your heart."
1,Just plain awful,"This album is not just bad, it's embarrassingly bad. From the sophomoric ""artsy"" lyrics to the middle-aged ""raps,"" this is one cringe-worthy set of songs. This is the first Bruce Cockburn album I've ever heard but if his others are anything like this, I can't believe this guy has managed to sustain a career in music for so long. I see nothing to redeem this stuff. After seeing some 5-star reviews of this album, I have to wonder if the people who gave it such high marks had a different version than the one I've been listening to."
3,Lunchbox and thermos broke,"I have had trouble finding a kids lunchbox that contains an insulated thermos, rather than just a sports drink container, since I send milk to school with my daughter, and want it to stay cold until lunchtime.I was happy to finally find this lunchbox that had a thermos (I bought a pink version of this lunchbox at a local store). After a few weeks of using the lunchbox and thermos, the lunchbox clasp broke, and the handle on the thermos cup broke.I agree with the previous reviewer who said that a soft sided lunchbox with a zipper would be more durable."
2,Good fit but thin material,I like to carry my phone this way and even though Motorola does not make this kind of carrier (which I have used in the past) I purchased this aftermarket version. The fit is fine but the plastic material is quite thin and it doesn't take a lot of force to defeat the plastic and the cell phone goes flying. OK for light duty only.
4,not just an insightful reading about monastic life,"This is certainly a wonderful book about monsatic life. The author, was obviously trusted by many to be able to enter into their lives so poingantly. Yet, this may not be the most revealing insight in this book. I found most meaningful the stories of real life...within the monastary for sure, but human stories of relationship, covenant, community, all lived out in the presence of our God...and all told from the unique perspective of a searching and grieving father.This book certainly gives you more than a peek at monastic life...but read sacredly the review at the bottom of the cover...this book certainly was a good and Godly ""kick in the assumptions.""Read and ponder."
1,Real View of Trappist Life ?,"If one wants a balanced and realistic view of monastic life and history, three recent books are highly recommended- ""Cloister Walk"" by Kathleen Norris, ""Grace is Everywhere"" by James Behrens, and, ""Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire"" - the companion book to the PBS documentary ""Trappist"" (WVTI Charlotte Public Television, 1997.I've been regularly going on retreats to a Trappist monastery since 1988, - I purchased Mr. Bianco's book when it first came out, ( at the Abbey gift shop as a matter of fact ), and was rather surprised and perplexed by his tone and view throughout.If you want the straight story with no spin, look at the above selections."
2,Really?,"I read this after seeing several comments on Twitter and thought it would be a great suspense (medical) thriller. I'm actually not sure which genre this should be in... very disappointing. As a former nurse, I couldn't relate to the story OR the characters. Was hoping for much more. Ugh!"
4,A Man to die for,"I am an RN and like nurse mysteries. I like Saints and Sinners the best, but this was worth the read"
4,A whole new generation wow!,"Microsoft Windows Vista Business 32-bit for System Builders [DVD] Software makers, bless their little ""off-the-shelf-selves"" do really try to make things better and after working with this on a considerable number of builds over the last 18 months, it is pretty good. Make sure that you have enough band-width to download 45 updates to start with. Do not install production programs until it is updated it self. It will still need anti-virus protection. I would say run from upgrades and only make a clean install on a crip new machine assembled with Vista products in mind. For future upgrades, remember 64 bit is coming. While we hate to say good bye to good old XP It is time. Hope this helps."
3,The superlative horse,"Book was in OK shape, a lot of writing and library stamps on the inside of the cover and leaf."
3,"Good, but not exciting.","I was looking forward to this CD, there doesn't seem that much that is exciting about one of America's most innovative and intriguing musical minds. This CD didn't do it for me. I particularly did not care for the use of the chorus in the third movement of Three Places in New England. Too many fragments with little flow.....alas, someone else will need to fill this void and I don't think that it will be Michael Tilson Thomas."
3,Good Set For Old School Matrial Arts,These were good movies. The picture quality wasn't the best but I enjoyed each of these movies. They have some well known old school martial arts stars in them including Jimmy Wang Yu. None of these movies are already in my collection and I have heard that Movies from Kung Fu Theater can be rare finds.
2,"Interesting subject, Poor Book","I was very interested when I heard the subject of this book. The eunuchs of India is a subject that very little has been written about. This book promised to tell about this ""invisible"" group. Instead I kept reading the author's story of her dificulties in finding any infomation only to find the book end without almost any information being found. This was disapointing especially since the story was hard to follow and I only managed to follow it in hopes of finding an in depth look at this fascinating group. I hope that one day another researcher will write the book that this author promises the reader and then never achieves. In the end this book would be better as an introduction for further studies than a book on its own."
1,Left me wanting more ??,"I think Zia did a lot of research but after reading the book I have to look back and ask ""what did I really learn about the Eunuchs"" ? The answer to that is unfortunately -- nothing. She missed a HUGE opportunity when visiting with a Doctor to find out a lot about the Eunuchs and failed miserably. Great subject matter and it takes an effort to fail with such a great and interesting subject. Save your money !!!!!!"
2,Promising author wanders a bit in this one.,"Ms. Jaffrey is at her best when on the subject of viewing India through the eyes of a 'semi-Indian'. The topic as discussed is a bit disjointed and hard to follow. I would like to see her write a travelogue in the manner of Theroux on her experiences in India as one who straddles the fence between western and eastern culture. She exhibits alot of promise, and though this effort is somewhat tedious I'm sure she'll have good things to come"
2,A dull Jackie Collins books-isn't that a oxymoron?,"Look, the characters are Teddy Pendergrass, Sade and Rod Stewart. They might go by other names but that is who they are based on. The book is an easy read but is one of Collins' weaker works. None of the characters are all that interesting and in the end, you don't care who survives the hostage situation in the music mogul's house. For a better Jackie Collins novel which involves a musician, get Lovers and Gamblers. It is sooooo much more interesting with much more interesting characters-Al King and Dallas."
3,interesting,i read this book some years back&was curious as to how Jackie Collins would speak on the Business.well this is cool in spots it is very Entertaining to say the least.
3,Dave Barry Rocks,"Dave Barry is one of the finest writers out there. Boy, I wish i could have his job, writtng booger jokes all day. This book is another of his comic geniuses just as funny as any other."
5,WTA Review gets 5 stars plus chipmunk gets 1 star,for being the loyal Beethoven fan (was it really a groundhog from Beethoven famous song?)- which make it six star review.No stars for kid messing up with Beethoven.
3,Good but aren't really lightweight,"For a reasonably priced chrome caliper set this is a good price. It's not really that lightweight, kind of a deceptive name, but it's not the heaviest caliper out there. Looks nice, works nice and affordable. Recommended."
2,tekro r580s brakes,"i have these brakes on my boardman team, i have had to replace the tension bolt in both front and back brake as they have both snapped while i have been cycling, i have had to service the brakes countless times as they hardly every sit strait. they are ok but if you can afford Shimano 2012 105 Caliper Bicycle Brake - BR-5700 then defo upgrade! i would recommend these if you are cycling only a few miles a day as they will cause more problems than they will solve"
5,great review and overview,"This is an excellent introduction, summary and critique of globalization for anthropologists/social scientists/individuals interested in such topics. You'll find the text readable and accessable. The examples are good and the timely as well. If you want one good resource on the topic of globalization, this is it."
4,A thrilling throwback to 80's Horror,"I had a lot of fun with Witch of the Fall. I was pleasently surprised pacing and the creepy ambiance delivered by J. Jesse Harley as a possesed custodian. Andrew James and Cheryl Meyers were a great addition to the supporting cast. I do wish the production value was a little higher, but then I read that it was the directors first feature... Wow, if he did this in round 1, I can't wait to see his next creation. I also really appreciated the humor delivered by the teenagers. This is definately worth a view."
5,Tremendously amazing CD!!!!,This cd is amazing and is one you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping one song. Great man of God with a wonderful sound. You will not be disappointed got me through a rough patch in my life.
2,wasn't worth the wait,I bought this product because I was having such a hard time finding a thermos for my daughter. Unfortunately this didn't come with the thermos it was advertised to come with. It came with a really cheap sports bottle instead. Other wise it's a regular lunchbox and if that's what your looking for it will suit your needs.
3,A little disappointed,"My 5-year old daughter loves her lunch box. We were both a little disappointed that it didn't come with the thermos that was shown with it (which is one reason we ordered that lunch box)--instead she got a sport bottle and juice box holder. All in all, it is a good lunch box that she seems satisfied with."
2,Not worth the Price,This item didnt last very long it was not worth the price for the length of time it was used.
5,Speedway to Sunshine: The Story of the Florida East Coast Ry,Well worth the wait. Exceptional chronicle about the Florida East Coast Railway. This book is a must have for anybody interested in the Florida East Coast Railway or Florida History in general. Commendations are in order for Seth Bramson for his relentless efforts in producing this book.
5,Florida lore,"If you're just visiting the Sunshine State or a lucky enough to live here, this fascinating story of early Florida and the Florida East Coast Railroad is a great afternoon reading adventure ...This small railroad led to the development of Palm Beach, Miami, and virtually the entire Florida Gold Coast ... the remains of the railway still can be seen on the drive to Key West today ...Get a copy for your personal library or your coffee table...."
4,Great product for the price,"For a $5 pedometer is a great deal. It's easy to setup and the sensitivity adjustment works well. It takes a couple of try-and-error to get the right sensitivity, otherwise will not record your steps or record every movement, but in the end is accurate enough (I would say 2-3% error on step count)."
5,Love this!,I would have left the review in the package feedback but it was shipped with something else. I have noticed that if you do not set the plus minus on how it counts the steps that it will add steps but it does not bother me.
1,Difficult to Set,I ordered 2 of these. They are difficult to set. It took 3 people to try to figure out the directions and no one had any luck. They were cheap and not even worth the postage to return. Don't bother purchasing!
3,Best pedometer so far,"We have tried several pedometers in the last year or so, this one is the most accurate, and robust thus far."
3,Good story but poorly proofread,"This was one of the first e-books I bought after getting a Kindle for Christmas. While the story is pleasant enough (I've read a couple of the other books in the series)it was maddeningly bad in quality. There are literally hundreds of proofreading glitches throughout the book, most of them not interfering with the story but a constant irritant nonetheless. After a while it did start to affect how much I was able to enjoy the story. I hope this is not harbinger of other poorly proofread books. Be warned."
1,Don't Buy!!,Horrible item. Material really really thin. Small sizes. It never even came close to fitting. Bad purchase!!
4,convenient little TV,"So far this TV is fine, but nothing special. The wide screen gives the picture an ""off"" quality to me, and I don't know if that is just true of all wide screens. Picture is not as clear as I get from my Panasonic flat screen, audio is fine, but for me it would have to be bad to be a problem. One irritant is a misunderstanding in the product data. It is described as having PIP, which I thought was great for the price. When I got it, I found out that it does not have 2 tuners, so can't do TV PIP, but can be used as a computer monitor, and get TV or video PIP on the computer screen if you want it. Or, TV, plus video PIP. I think the Panasonic is a little better quality, but this one will do the job for a basic TV if you are not too fussy. I wouldn't get it unless it was on sale, but it isn't bad enough to send back."
2,"Great for DVDs, Bad for PC use","I bought this TV to use as a monitor, with infrequent DVD / TV / Xbox usage on a side. This was a bad move.While this TV does an excellent job at displaying movies, it's quite poor as a monitor, and aside from working with Microsoft Office, it renders most first-person games (i.e. Half-Life 2, etc.) completely blurry.Additionally, it must be stressed that the monitor mode is *not* widescreen. It is impossible to utilize all the monitor space without stretching the image, and after using it for 4 months, I have resorted to using the unstretched version, which wastes about 20% of the screen space.I wish someone told me this before I bought this item, but if you're planning to buy a widescreen TV to use as a monitor, make sure that you buy one that supports widescreen pixel resolutions, like 1280x768. If you end up purchasing an item (like this) that just has a regular full-screen resolution setting (i.e. 1024x768), you'll be wasting your money."
1,Back it goes.,"After a lot of thought and price comparing, I bought this HDTV because the reviews were good, and the price was low. I shoulda known that it was too good to be true.The picture quality in 480p HDTV mode, while crisp and detailed, is tinted orange. The VGA mode display is tinted blue. While the tint in HDTV mode can be fiddled with (but not correctly), in VGA mode it can't.The monitor was also shipped with a quarter sized spot in the middle of the screen that was very obviously blurred, dark and damaged.Maybe I'm being picky, but $500 is $500. Back it goes."
1,Not as advertised,"Product is 6"" short of the 9' advertised length and the backing material is very thin (not much thicker than a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet). When I bought this exact same product 5 years ago, the backing was much more substantial, and I was happy with my purchase. This time I'm not and will be requesting a refund."
3,Pretty good compared to others,This mat is a good size. Bigger than most. A little pricey considering there is no ball return and the Holes and Water traps are just cut outs from the box. I bought a ball return for it and I'm pretty satisfied over all though.
1,DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR. AMAZON COMPLETELY UNACCOUNTABLE.,"Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order. Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail. Refused package a month ago. Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them, since Amazon takes no responsibility. Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES. BEWARE!!!"
5,WOW,"Wow,I'm a positive thinker so I got this set for our daughter when she was still 8 months old. Now at 18 months, they're so used we've had to duct-tape the bindings. OK all you parents, throw out the videos and gadgets and RUN straight out and buy these books. The color, the layout and the quality are all terrific. OK, I'll admit that our girl seems to love books best of all, but these are by far her favorites. She really started taking them seriously as soon as she touched them. The pictures and they way they are categorized make for fun learning and they worked so well, we had to buy the bath time versions just to get her to put them down in the bath."
2,too many mistakes/no best practices,"This book had a lot of potential, but it has far too many mistakes.It does not take into consideration corporate best practices.There are better books out there, use them."
5,Excellent Product,"The last guy was obviously not a pro, because I have this set up in my club and it is amazing! Probably the bext VJ software on the market, VirtualDJ/Numark CUE blows the socks off of the competition for performance, quality and customizability of the application. Highly recommended to any professional; but not for the novice user."
4,Ballroom DJ,"This product is good enough for ballroom djing. It has the flexibility of inserting requested songs, you can go on autopilot and dance all night long.Compared to the more expensive softwares which has a more difficult learning curve. CUE 5.0 is pretty simple. If you have common sense your ok. It does have its cons. Scratching is not as good as I thought but I don't need that in ballroom. You might have to have a lot of ram on your computer to work the scratch feature better. Support is not that exciting."
1,Not worth your time,"I picked up this book because according to the display in my local library, it's a great new African-American women's novel. I actually forced myself to finish it because I wanted to make sure I wasn't judging it unfairly. Basically, I wouldn't suggest anyone waste his/her time on this book--it was not particularly well-written (the dialogue was stilted, the narration constantly said explicitly what could have been implied or shown to the reader in a more interesting way); the plot was incredibly contrived (drama after drama happens--to reveal here that there's a car crash, a near-mugging, a death in a gunshot robbery, a meningitis scare, and lots of post-traumatic stress syndrome doesn't spoil any of the pleasure of the book), and the characters were never three-dimensional enough for me to care about them."
3,So-So,"This book was like a soup that was under seasoned- bland. Don't get me wrong, the writer is very talented, that's clear by her lyrical, concise prose. But overall, Shadow Dancing is filled with mundane people having mundane experiences. The most interesting person is Darlene, but unfortunately, she's just a secondary character who's given a sketchy life. Come to think of it, where were all of the strong, lasting subplots? It seems the writer killed of a major character when there wasn't anything else to do. This book lacked depth and substanstiality, but on a positive note, it wasn't torture."
4,Shipping was Quck,This arrived faster than expected or promised. Great addition to my eight place settings. Could not find this in any retail store.
2,not so great,"Not very easy to navigate through your music, so if you like to put things in folders, this is probably not the player for you.After about 6 months of use, the resume function no longer works, which is very irritating because I listen to audio books with the thing!!!Product manual it came with was useless.The only I will say for it is that it is very very lightweight and easy to carry around."
1,NOT the Virgin MP3 Player ... as advertised,"This is NOT, I repeat NOT, the MP3 player advertised, as being the Virgin brand device. This is some crummy lozenge shaped flash drive with an MP3 decoder. The display is almost useless. The manual that comes with it is incomprehensible. I would guess it was translated by someone who had finished the second year of high school English, somewhere in remote China. The controls are tiny and difficult to use, and I expect they will not last one year. Pick something else. I wish I had."
3,"Cute idea, but not much to it...","This is the ""modern"" paper doll, using magnets instead of paper. The dolls are actually printed metal boxes with Cinderella and her Prince on each side. I like the idea of a reusable item, but instead of just focusing on outfits, shoes, and such there are lot of tiny, easily lost accessories like the mice, Lucifer the cat, etc. I'm constantly finding these small pieces and I don't know how many I haven't found."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this product would be larger. The pieces were small & difficult for my granddaughters, ages 4 and 6 to handle."
4,Interesting read,"I bought this book for a graduate class I was taking and while it was a little dry at times it still contained a wealth of information on the Appalachian region and their struggles and hardships. It gives you a good perspective into the lives of a people who are normally looked down upon for being viewed as little more than ""backwoods hillbillies"" and lets you see these truly remarkable people for the hard workers and cultured beings that they are."
4,Appalachia History,"I was born in Fort Gay WVa.1927 and grew up in south-western Va. Mount Rogers area in the 30s. Life in Troutdale Va.was at least 50 years behind the rest of civilization.I lived the life of the pioneers no electricity, no indoor plumbing, subsistence farming,hunting wild game, trapping and trout fishing in cold mountain streams.I didn't know this was Appalachia until I left it to go to war. ""Appalachia a History"" Fills in the gaps between myth and reality in the lives of Appalachian people in a detail that is absent in other history books.For me ""Appalachia a History"" is a nostalgic adventure of my self discovery."
2,Almost like a home video...very amateurishly done.,"It was like a home video, we could have done the same thing if we made it at home with a tripod. Her previous video was much better in quality...peaceful, serene, and easy to follow. This one...yuck!Definitely not worth the [...] price! One would expect a second video to be better and improved over the first...but it's BAD!"
4,Relevant to today,This book gives some insight into how we got to today's political and religious scene. You can even make some parallels showing that we really are not much diffenent that we were 150 to 200 years ago.I do wish that Mr. Burleigh had a more journalist style rather than a scholarly style or writing. His long sentences and paragraphs make for slow reading.
2,Mediocre,"The writing seems to be recycled Shakti rather than the innovative, creative, purposeful Shakti of the past. Would not recommend this book."
1,Nothing new here.,Nothing new here - all came from much more inspirational books. I heard a lot about Shakti so was looking forward to reading it. If you are a beginner it may be a good place to start.
4,The Four Levels of Healing,"Wonderful book on balancing the spirtual, mental, emotional and physical aspects of life."
3,Peace Sign Strap,I bought this strap for an electric bass guitar. It did not seem to hold the weight. It slipped off while playing. I think this is better for a classical guitar. I still love the Peace signs.....:-)
5,A Trustworthy Private Tutor,"By the time I opened this book I had already read more than a dozen biographies of composer Gustav Mahler. What could this one add?Well, it surprised me. It lives up to its name: GUSTAV MAHLER: THE SYMPHONIES. What it does is give you a thorough explanation of each Mahler symphony. It tells you things like when it was written, why it was written, how it was written, and suggestions as to ""what the music means,"" which is especially relevant to Mahler's music.Thus, if I could have only a single book on Mahler, this would be the one I would keep, because it will be my learned, private guide or tutor, to better help me understand--and love even more--each Mahler symphony"
2,Crime Writers' Annual,"This is not exactly what I expected, older short stories by many authors I am not aquainted with. There have been a few I really did like- that they caught me totally off-guard w/ their endings. Nice to have around when you don't have alot of time to read- but you can finish a short story quickly."
5,Great Book,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it and is on her way to finishing her first children's book. She said this book helped her in writing her book and also getting it published.
4,Informative,"In just a short time reading this book I have learned so much about writing Children's books, getting them ready for submittal and how to find a publisher. Worthwhile read to get started."
3,"Good place to start, BUT...",Good place to start even theough this information changes rapidly. I'd still like to see a book on using self-publish companies like XLibris or Heliographica.com which more and more writers are using to create children's books.
1,how to write a children's book and get it published,it's kind of hard to believe that this book would get published considering that it was so terrible it almost made me feel bad because the author was humiliating herself by writing such an awful book.
2,The information in this book is out-of-date.,"Even though this is the revised edition, I have been told by professionals in the children's book industry that the information I got from this book is out-of-date and incorrect."
5,It's embarrasing....,Yes I was over 30 when these came out .... fortunately I had kids and I could blame them for it being on the TV. Great stories.
1,not one car in the set!,"I understood from the other reviews to expect some variation from the picture, but there was not one car in the entire set. Instead, I received a set consisting of jacked-up, bizarre looking 'off-roaders'--barely recognizable to my 2-year-old as cars. I get the feeling that Amazon has gotten its hand on some pretty bad surplus sets. In any case, DO NOT BUY this set if you want Matchbox CARS."
4,Nice looking cars,"My son loves these little cars. I was impressed by how nice they look and how smoothly they roll around. He has other cars, but he seems to prefer these matchbox cars over the other ones he has received."
3,Not as good as his Charlie Salter Series,I liked this book but not as much as some of the author's others. Plods a bit through the middle but has a great ending to make up for it.
5,Excellent Spanish/English Dictionary,I have had a copy of the American Heritage Spanish Dictionary since the 1990's. My sister was interested in a copy and I bought it and had it sent to her. Excellent book.
4,"If Max Martin met Chuck Palahniuk, the collaboration would resemble Ayumi's debut effort","If Max Martin met Chuck Palahniuk, the collaboration would resemble Ayumi's debut effort. Themes touched upon in this album range from dead-beat fathers to full blown existentialism.On first glance, the songs seem like any late 90's pop act; however, beneath the synthesizers and flashy production, Ayumi's raw, poignant lyrics reach out to the Holden Caulfield in everyone.The song 'Poker Face', Ayumi's first major hit, touches upon the subject of loneliness, and self-worth; obviously drawn from Ayumi's rough childhood.*Even if you are not proficient in Japanese, I'd recommend downloading the English translation of her lyrics; Ayumi Hamasaki is a worthy artist; and that should be enough to surpass the language barrier."
3,"It works, mostly","The case fits the phone comfortably- no forcing it on and not too much rattle once it's on. The case halves snap into each other on 3 sides (top is somewhat open to access the back cover release- which you have to take the case off to do). I caught an open edge on something 3 times in the first 6 hours I had the case, popping it open and sending the phone to the ground. A short bit of electrical tape on the sides keep the case intact and I haven't had a problem since. If you remove/access the SD card often, you may want to consider something that is more of a slip case. I don't, so this arrangement works well for me. Access to all buttons, camera and mic/speaker holes is great. I've not had anyone complain of muffled voice when I talk to them and I can hear them clearly. The clip is acceptable, but nothing spectacular."
2,Passager,"This story is about an eight-year-old boy who is abandoned in the woods of medieval England. A year passes. A year of hunger, sleeping in trees, and outrunning packs of wild dogs. Until one day a man, who lives near by, captures him and takes the boy home with him. While the boy is living with the man, the man teaches the young boy to be mature. Then one day when the boy reveals something he never knew before.My opinion is this book is boring because it does not tell you enough information. It is too short and if it had more details it might be okay. And it does not have enough stuff a good book should have."
1,very disappointing,Not sure what the reviewer who said it could be held in either hand was planning to use it for. I guess technically that's true but...The thing looks formidable enough to carve up a bear into steaks but the reality is that it wouldn't hurt a fly (or an apple peel). I'm guessing the angle is wrong or the opening is not wide enough. I maimed three apples trying to remove peel to no avail. My learning curve stayed straight as an arrow. Suggest you pick up one of the $2 peelers from your local supermart. I have 2 and they actually will remove peel from an apple. You could keep this by the door to scare away intruders (just don't try to peel them). Perhaps my worst buy ever from Amazon.
3,All the Pretty Children Die,"My book club also read this one. While one cannot dispute that Annie Dillard is a wonderful craftsman of words and prose, I didn't feel that she exacted the necessary character attachments and drama for this to be a successful novel. Perhaps we would have been better served had she stayed with her forte: non-fiction.On the plus side, I have not read a more beautiful or perfectly written final paragraph in recent memory, which endeared the book to me more so than it would have otherwise."
4,Pacific Northwest in all its rough glory.,"So this was 19th Century Puget Sound before we messed it up with logging, suburbs, freeways, and all the other entaglements of modern life? I'm sorry I missed it; battling I-5 traffic is not nearly as adventurous as trying to fell 500 year old fir trees by burning out the core (it's in the book). A great story; Dillard is a quirky writer, but that makes the book fun"
3,"A Lot of Words, Not Much Substance","The writing style is slow, with long paragraphs of little meaningful content. There are gems, but they are few and buried. By the last couple of hundred pages, I found myself just reading a few words per paragraph, and didn't feel like I was missing anything. To the extent that it interestingly conveys information about characters and the historical setting, it could have done so much more engagingly."
1,Oh my God!What a horrendous book!,"I also read this book in German, also at ""high school"" (in Luxembourg). I found it was one of the worst books I ever read, and the more often i read it, the more i hated it. This books tells the story of a man who has built a perfect-life fassade and shows how this fassade crumbles. This happenes by a series of really impossible random events, which in real life have a probability of 0.00000 to happen. The whole book is based on that. That makes the whole book completely unbelievable (in the first sense). Ugh...I was really disgusted that someone could write such a piece of...well let's say rubbish."
5,"Technology, Life, Love and Irony","This report is a difficult lovestory. The dry life of a technologist faints more and more during a love-relationship with his own daughter. The world of probability and dull nature changes into the world of ""family"" and love, death and warm rain. Max Frisch did already a wonderful job in the original, german version, but even translated it will enchant you. I give this book 5 stars, because it is ""eyeglue"" and won't let you go. It made it happen that I can see the nature in a different way and it is still influencing my life. The end was completely shocking, but it was the right one. This book is recommended for people who want to read an experience and not just a pulp pamphlet."
4,"great sound, clean install and very compact","This basslink sounds excellent, not the loudest system ever but definately fills the car/suv and then some. great space saver too, its sooooo nice not having to hide an amp and run extra wires. The remote bass control is excellent, and leaves room in your trunk for plenty of cargo or whatever. I had it in a Grand Cherokee and it did exactly what I wanted it to. if your factory speakers are ok but just don't cut it, then forget all the other expensive cumbersome upgrades and stick with this, you shouldn't be dissappointed. I'm sort of an audiophile and have had many many systems before with giant amps and 15"" subs and all that, but this has been one of my favorites for the size, price, and sound!"
2,Not So Good,"The box does not take up much space,But you pay for it.I really thought the single 10"" would produce a stonger noteThis box is really only good if you have a single cab pick-up and want to add a bit of bass as for SUV's forget it.The price on Amazon was the best with shipping and everything."
1,Batteries were total junk,"I have some SLK series TalkAbout radios that are probably over 12 years old. The original batteries finally just died of old age. I had trouble finding the correct batteries, but finally found these. It took 45 days for them to arrive and when they did, neither battery would charge, not withstanding which charger or radio I tried them in. I suspect these batteries were probably as ancient as the ones I replaced. I will be returning them shortly, assuming I have not waited to long to deal with this."
5,Rechargeable battery for Talkabout,These are getting hard to find but they work really well. We have use 280 and 289 batteries for years on the farm. Only trouble is when they are outside in the cold and lose power more quickly. Once warmed up they work well.
5,My Favorite,"I have all of Sylvia's books but return often to play the beautiful, original pieces in the Harp of Brandiswhiere.This suite is performed by many harp ensembles, and solists along with the story narration. I find the pieces also stand alone, and I enjoy always performing them. My favorites are the waltz-tempo, In The Forest, the hauntingly beautiful Lament, and Morning Calm. Because of the beautiful melody and rubato style Morning Calm lives up to the name. I know others will enjoy this highly creative, original score as much as I have.Judy Diaz, Harper"
4,harp of brandiswhiere,"Most of the songs in this book are very pretty. I especially like Lament and Morning Calm. Along with being lovely performance pieces, I think they can also be good warm-ups and background music.I could do without the story (overuse of adjectives and a cliche plot line do not an epic make), but since that's not the main reason I bought the book, it's not a big deal.I currently play a 22 string harp, so some of the songs get out of my range on the high end. Usually just dropping down an octave works to get around that, but if you have at least a 29 string harp, you will have no problems with range.If you want some songs that are original and pretty but generally not too difficult--I would say intermediate level, mostly--this is the songbook for you."
5,My personal favorite of this series,"Moving back and forth in time and yet appearing timeless, this chapter in the world of Paradys has Jewish exorcism, sex-incarnate beasts, Romans and doomed lovers. Every element is precise and every part connects to the other parts with a beautiful serendipity.If you noticed that the other reviews of this book are brimming with fantastic prose and wonderous metaphors, it is because the fairy-tale inspired style of Tanith Lee inspires her readers to greater heights of passion than other novelists.I also like the fact that the Jewish scholar saves the day. Why should the priests have all the fun in exorcisms? Jewish mysticism is much more fun than Catholic mysticism any day."
1,Warning Metal caps only,"Be Open Beer and Soda Bottle Opener, WhiteThis is for other dummies like me. This opener is for metal capped bottles only. I need help with the plastic caps on water and soda bottles. If used for it's pupose I'm sure it would be a five star."
4,Perfect accessory,"The BE OPEN is a lot of fun and easy to use. i've noticed that it tends to get stuck or take more than one ""pop"" to open some bottles, but overall, very satisfied. construction is a little on the chintzy side as it's all plastic except for the metal jaw."
1,:-(,I bought this hoping to get assistance opening plastic pop bottles. this opener is for glass bottles only. the title deceiving
2,Not quite the 'one step process',"As soon as I received this, I got out a beer to practice with before giving it as a gift. I wanted to see how easily this worked. I was disappointed that the cap didn't lift off the beer cap in one quick step. I had to try 3-4 times on several beers, working on improving my technique to get the cap off. If it had worked the first time easily, I could have wrapped it back up, enjoyed the beer, and given it as a gift, but since I had taken the time and $ to order this product, I wasted several beers just trying to get it right. I'm still unsure whether or not this will be a good gift to give..."
4,Not too shabby,"This device is useful, but could easily be replaced by a lighter and dexterity. Great as a conversation starter (the ole ""how does that even work?"" is the usual response). If you like bottles, and you like novelty, buy this item."
2,I loved it until it broke,"I bought this item for my boyfriend for Christmas. He absolutely loved it, until it broke on it's 3rd use. If I am able to get a replacement from the company I will edit my review and give it 5 stars. He offered to open his brother's beer just to use it!! I am extremely disappointed that the spring popped out, we are unable to fix it ourselves. I truly hope they replace it, it really is a cool item."
5,I loved it!,I would recomend this book from any teen to adult. I first read this book as a freshmen in high school and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This was my third time reading it and I couldn't put it down. You get into the life of all of the characters and you go through their happiness and pain.
3,description about life during the french revolution in Europ,"this book is very difficult to read. you need to have a lot of patience, for it takes about 100 words for Dickens to make a point in his book. the story is very well written and the descriptions about life in london and Paris at the time of the French revolution are well depicted. I just think that Dickens needed to speed up his novel, and probably it would have had a better succes."
2,Bad choice for me,"Liked the look when I attached them. Cleaned the area and let it dry before I put them on, (self stick tape strip). Peeled the back off and attached with a little pressure to make sure they were on good. The one on the right was hanging the next day. Pushed it back and held it there for awhile. Took a ride the following day and it was gone. The one on the drivers side is still there. Bought 2 sets originally but gave the other away. Will have to check if he's still got his on."
4,Need one for 2007 models,"This is a great product. However, they don't make one for the 2007 model tahoe/yukon, so I had to send it back. I did find that the 2000 Explorer model works OK, though the passenger angle is off a bit."
2,Nice looking but cheap,"OK - the MP3 module is nice, though it does not hold a lot of music. Typically 12-14 songs however, the ease of downloading into the visor and module is very nice. Now, about the clip...What a peice of garbage. For anyone who works out or does anything active and wants music to tag along, this IS NOT the equipment for the job. The clip does not secure to anything and if the energy hits the ground, forget it, you will be using super glue and rubber bands to hold it together. You would think that with all the technology out there, Soundsgood would come out with something a little more impressive and durable for those with an active life style- I know I would be willing to pay a little more for something more durable applicable for working out. Please, invent something, quickly!!!!"
4,Harcore 100,"If you are looking for solid base training and the weather outside is unfavourable, then this is the Spinerval for you. I have done it a few times now in preperation for my upcoming Ironman. I have a compact chainset so have not reached the 100 miles yet, but am not that far off and it is getting better. I did purchase a cadence meter though and this made a tremendous difference to keeping focused throughout the entire +5h30. Another tip is, turn off the music and use whatever music motivates you, listening to their selection once was enough. Enjoy the sweat!"
3,"Too General, Just another On-line Branding Book","This book focused too much on ""on-line banner"". It also covered sucessful on-line brand which we are just too familiar. There isn't much effort in providing other example. The book appear to be more like a report for reader to understand what is happening on the interent today, rather than providing useful insight for reader to use in the near future. The tag line of ""On-line Branding for Marketing Success"" does not seem to fit.It's good for readers who is not familiar with on-line marketing as this book offers very basic information.This is just another book about Branding via Internet."
1,Seriously out of date,"So much for the impact of online marketing and branding, most of the companies in the book are out of business just 5 years later."
1,Incorrect Title,"""Economics of Poverty and Discrimination"" speaks from a purely statistical economic sense. It is clear that the author has never actually been in poverty or been discriminated against. He leaves out all of the psychological and environmental repercussions of poverty and discrimination. The world is not a narrowminded labor market."
5,Get this one while you can!!!,This is an absolute great live album. The sound is great and Butterfield's Better Days Band are in excellent form. I wonder why this never came out in the domestic market so it could be better availiable. This is one album that should be bought for all Butterfield fans. The vocals are first rate and it includes an introduction by Bill Graham.
4,Great follow-up to _Spirit of '69_,"This book is quite informitive in regards to those who either do not know or just do not know much about the TRUE skinhead subculture and its well-integrated youth. The constant complaints and literary snarls towards the general media for slandering the working-class youths does become a bit repititious, yet Marshall wonderfully documents the subculture's spread around the world by displaying many photographs and writing of his own knowledge and that of the people he has met. For those of us who have been around the block, Skinhead Nation makes for a great coffee table book to spot out those we know."
5,Deep & Moving: Very Well done all around,"We coiled mortals are well represented here. This intoxicating film jars motherhood/loss/murder/penance all together in a non violent, gorgeously elegant way. I LOVED THIS FILM. There was a lot left unstated for the viewer to ponder at the end of this lyrical, haunting tale. For once the obvious wasn't thrust down our throats. Never proselytizing but actually deeply religious. A beautiful heart rending representation of adolescence in 21st century."
5,Impressive!,One of the best films I've seen in years. Intense and touching with questions you hardly find answers for. I've seen the film twice to plunge into the depth of TROUBLED WATER. Really glad I didn't miss this convincing low budget production.
3,All But the Finishing Minutes,"A well conceived and implemented story in which random, simple and insignificant everyday events such as spilling a drink on your shirt dramatically alter subsequent outcomes which in this case results in a simple robbery and which continues with an unexpected deadly consequence. With a ""degrees of separation"" series of coincidences all parties come together at the end of the movie to resolve their personal demons. The only issue I have with this finely directed, filmed and acted story is that the ending seemed forced, highly improbable and rushed as if the writers didn't know how to maintain their creative storytelling and simply decided to throw every-event-to-that-point into the blender and get it over with."
2,Disappointing and overbaked.,"There was the makings of a great thriller here, but Meade chose to focus on the wrong characters. I was never interested in the fate of Alex, a cold, hard-bitten killer whose motivations are kept under wraps until a (rather contrived) 11th hour reveal. If the story had been built around Massey's doomed attempt to save Alex from trying to carry out a mission that was inevitably going to lead him to disaster, it would have had a stronger emotional hook. But Meade spends much too much time setting up the mechanics of Alex's mission and not enough on giving us a reason to care about Alex. Since this isn't really alternate history, we know he's not really going to succeed, so it needed to be more about the 'why' and less about 'how.'Sometimes evocative, but structurally clumsy and with a choppy writing style (and some really contrived setpieces) that keep it from catching fire. A shame."
2,"Disappointing, even for Summer fare","It is rare that a plot turn is so awful, so hackneyed, so deus-ex-machina, so Wagnerian that it takes me by surprise. The ending of this book contains such a plot twist. I had to put the book down, blink, pick it up, and reread the relevant paragraphs to convince myself that the author really was being so pathetic. SW starts as harmless adolescent fantasy, as do many books in the spy-thriller genre, and ends by leaping in front of a speeding train labeled ""cliche""."
4,My First Spy Novel,"This is my first spy novel, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I don't lose tracks of the characters, and the story flowed smoothly.There were previous reviews about Meade's mistakes regarding certain languages and topography. This I was not aware, but if this the case. Shame on him. I had two serious issues with the book. First, I had a problems visually with half of the action scenes. Second, why did Anna do through these bouts of weakness when she believed in once instance in the story, that Alex was being too brutal. I don't understand drastic times call for drastic measures."
4,"Great book, will keep you turning pages!","I bought this book recently after reading the abridged version. I was very pleased with it so I decided to buy the full version. This book was an amazing story and a real page turner. If you like CIA, KGB, and secret intelligence story's than this is for you. The only problem I had was that the book would have been just as good without some of the detailed sex scenes. Other than that, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read."
5,A page turner. Better than Ludlum or Trevanian.,"Meade has written a winner, in my opinion. I could not putthe book down and especially like the way he kept the actiongoing chapter after chapter. Meade blends a fictional story line with tidbits of historical facts ala James Michener. He (Meade) quickly develops the characters, but keeps some twists and turns to the last chapters which sneak up on the reader. The book is well written and fast pace."
5,GREAT NOVEL. ONE OF A KIND,"Although I thought it started slowly it quickly gathered my attention. This novel makes you think about all the events that we seem to have doubts about. Did one man kill Kennedy. Did Hitler commit suicide. How did Stalin die, are a few nagging questions many would like to know the REAL truth about. In this book Glenn Meade gives us an idea of what MIGHT have happened to Joseph Stalin. Glenn Meade blends his story with enough historic figures and locales to give it a touch of realism. At the end of this novel you will be saying to yourself aloud, ""WOW, I wonder if that really happened"". I find myself thinking about 'Snow Wolf' even though I have read other books since. I just hope Glenn Meade will satisfy us with another novel of this kind soon."
2,Making a case for skilled editing.,"This book was painful to read. While the plot otherwise would have been interesting, the sloppy disregard of facts and inattention to detail make the book embarassingly amateurish: 1)How can a one-armed man ride a BMW motorcycle that requires left-handed clutch and right-handed throttle operation? 2)How can he kick-start the motorcycle with the start lever on the right side when BMWs of that era had levers on the left side (to allow for a sidecar on the right)? 3)How can the world's best hand-to-hand combat trainer get beaten up 3 times in 30 pages (once by an untrained, petite girl)? 4)How can someone described as wearing a fine suit and a heavy overcoat be given an injection by rolling up his sleeve? Quality is in the details, Glenn."
4,Fine product good transcation,Product was as described- book in great shape and sent quickly. Very fair price as well.
2,A lazy attempt at writing a thriller. Go back to Tom Clancy.,"Glenn Meade depends on too many coincidences to advance the plot of this Cold War thriller. President Eisenhower asks how to stop a plan to kill Stalin when events spiral out of control. The simple answer is simply to put the book down, or grit your teeth until the end of this implausible tale for the limited joy of listing all of Meade's historical inaccuracies. You're better off with the classic thriller writers"
4,Great combo watch with ability to hide digital,"Great combo digital/analog watch for the price point. All the functions you need time,time2,date,seconds,chrono w/lap, countdown with 3 stages, alarm 1&2. Analog has easy to see hands with a second hand sweep in orange. Indiglo on digital only. Big complaint: no hourly chime!!! I need this feature. However, the watch allows you to turn off the digital display, which hides any trace of digital display... making it look like a normal analog watch. Very nice for transforming the look from ""sport"" to ""more dressy""."
3,Logo schmogo,"I'm not a fan of the logo treatment Elkay used on this sink. Most stainless sinks I see have some sort of laser etched gray logo treatment that is barely noticeable. Elkay chose to stamp the logo into the steel, so it is raised and bumpy. It is very noticeable. The nature of flexing metal like this to form a logo is such that the logo loses it's crisp edges as the metal has to mold around the corners. To me this treatment looked cheap and obnoxious. Nice finish on the sink. The sound proofing pads on the sides were not adhered well and were curling off. The sink is deep, maybe an inch too deep for a prep sink? I ended up sending this sink back and going a different direction. If you like the size of the sink, and don't mind the logo treatment, this could be a good sink for you. I do like the fairly tight radius on the corners and the straight sides. That is a unique shape for this price range, which was why I ordered this sink to begin with."
3,So So,"I really couldn't concentrate on this one, didn't seem to make it. The only reason to watch it is to see the absolutely stunning Maria Conchia Alonso. She is the real gem in this movie."
4,Love is blind,"I just saw this movie yesterday on cable it was great but I missed the begining, to bad you don't have it in stock. I recomend it just because it shows how someone can do anything for love."
4,There is really only one way,"What can I say, well 'One way' must be one of the most well known tracks the Levellers have ever produced. For all of you avid Levellers fans this is a classic mix which should not be left out from your collection. From the earlier songs such as 'Belaruse' and 'Julie' to the later 'Dogtrain', the Levellers have once again excelled theirselves with their mix of how I describe as fiddly bang of the drum type music."
3,Not up to par,"The textbook was used for a capstone Strategic Management course. The textbook was not written at a upperclassmen level. More like sophomore, maybe junior level at best."
3,Strategic Management : Competitiveness and Globalization,"I need this text for my Senior Management class. Compared to other text that I have used, I think this text has a nice look. therefor i gave it 3 stars since it meets the requirement for the class."
5,My favorite lip balm!,"This relatively new product from Blistex has become my favorite lip balm. First of all, it has a higher SPF than most other products, which I feel is important for protecting lips from drying sun damage. Secondly, its uniquely shaped tube makes the product easy to apply as well as easier to squeeze into a makeup bag, purse, or pocket. Finally, although the feel of this product is lightweight, it leaves my lips feeling intensely moisturized. Highly recommended!"
4,High Camp in Chatsworth,"An obscure production providing a charming mix of singing cowboys (Rogers) and cowgirls (Evans) who prove themselves as wranglers. The rendition of the Bing Crosby song ""San Fernando Valley"" is great, since the movie is shot in the Chatsworth Hills of the San Fernando Valley, above Los Angeles where Rogers lived until his recent death. More of a historical piece than anything else. Action-wise,it's typical low budget Saturday matinee stuff--but that's what makes it fun."
2,I really don't think this Toy is working properly.,"I have purchased Tolo Toys in the past with great success, unfortunately this one does not work properly all the time. I would try to return it, but my 13 month old son loves it and plays with it all day long."
2,LOUD,"We purchased this at a specialty toy store; they raved about this toy. The construction workers' arms, legs, and head click as they move. Also, the front loader moves up and down. The worker and vehicle are very durable. You can push down on the seat to hear the horn and ""start"" the engine. The vehicle moves forward about 8 feet and then giggles. It is a very loud toy. There is no way to change the volume. My one year old son does not play with this toy right now (other than throwing the worker onto the tile floor), perhaps when he is a little older for imaginary play. I expected a lot from this toy for the price and do not think it was worth the $40."
5,One More Time : The Best of Mike Royko,Mike Royko at his best. Learn more about him from intros to each section. Excellent with only 1 drawback: too hard to put down.
1,One thumb down,Royko was behind the times. His demise marks the evolution of responsible journalism.I found his book to be boring and filled with biting satire rather than poignant analysis written by a professional journalist. If you don't like to think this book is for you.
5,Mike Royko is the Best,I would always look forward to reading the Mike Royko columns in the paper. He always had a nice humorous take on the issues of the day. I was deeply saddened the day that he died. I kind of wish he were still around to comment on the current election mess. I was glad to see that they released a book of some of his better columns.
5,The best of the best,"Mike Royko had a gift. He was able to put into words what many of us either thought, or didn't dare to think. There were no subjects too tough for him to tackle-the Daley Machine, prejudice, or even the love of a good woman. His biting wit left us laughing, often uneasily. He captured the feel of Chicago as no one but perhaps Studs Terkel could. This book spans his whole career, and is entertaining from cover to cover. I have loaned this book to friends more than any other in my collection, but I make ... sure I get it back. A must have......."
4,Fun history,Like a good walk thru the city. Many approachs to people watching & this qualifies as a historical perspective also.
4,Funny and thought provoking,"I read this book in reverse chronological order, from back to front. Because I've lived in Chicago since 1983, it was a treat for me to read the older Royko columns from the 1960's and 1970's. Royko is very funny, naturally, but he could also be passionate about injustices. I wish the book had been much, much longer."
2,two games in one? more like only one game,There are two games loaded in one but one the Nemo game works so I was a negative with the saying two game in one
1,Is there anything in quant fin they won't milk?,"A very poor value for a tedious collection of the most poorly written papers. It it wasn't for Jarrow's name attached to this, they'd never sell a copy.This book is an unreadable doorstop, but don't think you are missing anything, pretty much everything you need to know from here can be told to you in ten minutes from a slightly senior person on any quant or options desk in the world."
2,"Too academic, already outdated","This is a collection of survey papers on volatility techniques. It's very academic, which means most of the papers are useless. There is not a single article I like, and no successful practioners I know of uses these techniques. Successful models are often simple and straightforward and it's the human who employs these models that make a difference. This book was published shortly before the collapse of Long Term Capital, and most of the contents are already sorely out-of-date."
3,Required by the school teacher.,"My son is using this book, and find it quite useful. He tells me he does not understand some things, but when he asks the teacher, she clarifies. I should say that he is not enthusiastic about the guitar, because he feels bored with the first lessons. I told him that in the beginning the lessons can be difficult and even a little tedious, but if he persists, he will achieve a good domain of the instrument. Good Luck!"
2,Buy a copy of Playboy instead of this book.,"The Nudes Volume I had some really good unseen pictures, with many incredible nudes. This second book should never have been made. The photos are terrible, and the pictures are nothing compared to the first book. If your looking for nudes to study, this book is not the book to get. If you just want every book out there with nudes, then buy it."
4,Training wheels for the computer and e-mail,I bought my mother a Mailstation last Mother's day and she absolutely loved it (as was apparent from my inbox). It was easy and quick to set-up and to get started. My mother had little computer knowledge at the time and it was a great way for her to communicate with her friends while learning the basics about e-mail. There were only two downfalls to the Mailstation: #1 The messages it can receive are strictly text-only and can only be so long & #2 Mom loved it so much that I had to buy her a computer for Christmas! I was very satisfied with my purcase of the Mailstation -- it served it's purpose well for the little bit that I had to pay for it.
1,mailstation,I have called mailstation 5 times and they still are unable to activate the machine. I don't know what the problem is but I am returning the first machine and trying again. If this does not activate on one call I will return it also.
4,Wouldn't use anything else!,We are on our 2nd littermaid litterbox and at this point wouldn't use anything else. We had our first one for over 6 years which we believe was a lot of bang for our buck; especially getting such a good price and free shipping from Amazon. We haven't had any problems with our second one which we've been using for over a month now. It might be a small hassle to put the privacy tent together but to us overall it has been great. Controls litterbox smell which is the most important thing to me. Sorry others have had problems and thankful ours has worked fine.We do not purchase the add'l plastic boxes; we just place plastic grocery bags in the box where the cat waste is deposited and replace/clean out once a week.
5,Just what I was looking for!,These deck lights were just what I was looking for. The price was reasonable and delivery was quick!Haven't put them in yet but I know they'll be just great.
5,Absolutely briljant,"No words left to say,you can buy this one blindely if you like platipus.Breathtaking beautiful..............."
4,Sound Anthology,"As an avid reader of numerous books published by Semiotext[e] I found this anthology to be an excellent sampling of essays and short-stories. There are a few pieces included which are pointless--some shortstories and interviews--but there are enough gems to make this book worthwhile.The selling point for me was the two entries by Ulrike Meinhof (of the Baader-Meinhof Gang, RAF) entitled ""Armed Anti-Imperialist Struggle"". I've always been interested in the Red Army Faction (which, for some reason, other authors in this anthology call the ""Red Army Fraction"") so I was excited to read Meinhof's apologetics. Some of the Deleuze and Guattari entries were worth the purchase as well."
2,Not what I expected - very kid-focused,"I was disappointed in this book. Based on the pictures on the cover, I expected other creative and interesting uses of weaving materials to make attractive finished pieces (whether functional or not). Instead, much of the book focused on work done by children; far too many pages were spent on weaving paper strips, for example, and it seemed like the majority of photographs (most of which were in B&W) were captioned ""this piece done by a 6 year old"" or similar. The book felt as though it was targeted towards teachers and parents, not towards someone who would like to get more creative with fiber and other materials."
1,Supplied item has no R818 camera adapter,"The item is a brilliant accessory but unfortunately as supplid it will not fit my R818 camera.The 2 supplied clear plastic adapters fit my R417 & my sons R717, the R818 camera has a much smaller spade connector and the user accessory guide shows it being used with a black plastic adapter on the docking station.I've tried to E mail Amazon several times on this web site to purchase the correct product with no acknowlegement, result or response so I'm currently a bit dissappointed with the service - Be warned"
4,richk,"The dock is very easy to use in connecting the camera to your television or computer or printer for uploading your pictures. Just as important, since the battery that came with the docking station was defective, it showed me that HP customer service does indeed stand behind their product. I had a new battery within days of contacting customer service."
5,Dock for the R818 camera,Incase anyone purchases this dock for the R818 camera - you will have to call contact HP and they send you a part for the dock so it will fit the R818 camera. I purchased the dock and as a previous person reported it won't fit the R818 camera. HP is sending me this piece that will allow me to connect properly.
4,R818 camera & R-series dock,"The R818 camera will not fit the port on the R-series dock. Just call HP and request the adapter, they will send it to you for free. Part # C8887-40003 Nice camera, and HP service was excellent."
4,Hp R series dock,Excellent product and accessories. I am very happy with this and was able to find it on Amazon. I looked several other places and could not find what I needed. Thanks Amazon!!
1,Does not fit R817,"This dock does NOT fit the R817 Camera. Just bought this and the HP R817 and I am very disappointed. The input for the camera is to big for the 817. So do not buy this if you get the 817 **update** This review was written, when the dock was stated to fit the R817, which has been changed because it does not fit."
5,My 5 year loves it,He has played it about 20 times. He memorized the words. He love it.I enjoy it too.
2,OK for the price.,Looks good when you get it fit correctly. Much cheaper than real braided steel hoses. You need really good scissors to cut hose. The upper radiator hose cover was not large enough to fit over my stock hose. Difficult to get ends to look good without lot of fuss.
1,crap,They don't tell you that it will NOT fit all hoses. It's a nightmare trying to put this over hose's if you can get them on. I tossed mine.
3,Hose braid,Product looks good but several rolls of the braid had picks and pulled spots that made it hard to fit on the hose.
4,"Nice monitor overall, but caution","A very nice monitor (function & design), but my monitor came with numerous blurry zones. There are few such technologies that are ""perfect"", but given the cost of this monitor I would have expected much better quality control.I would still recommend it, but just be cautious."
4,Where's the DVD?,"Not the best western ever made. But, certainly one of the most interesting. The movie examines the myth-building potential that existed in the Wild West, where the popular press constructed American heroes (Billy the Kid, Jesse James, etc.) out of basically nothing. The script is tight and the acting is very good. And then there's the song. Guaranteed to plant itself into your brain. So, where's the DVD? With so much sub-par entertainment out there on DVD it is amazing that a movie as good as this is still only available in pan and scan VHS. Comeon videoczars, slap this feature on DVD."
4,A darkly delightful romance.,"From Noon Till Three is a totally atypical Bronson movie, an unexpected gem. Bronson plays a scruffy outlaw who seduces the lanquishing widow, prim and exquisite in her castle-like Victorian ranch house. Very charming, and deeply cynical, this western-set romance blends comedy and tragedy in ever tightening plot twists, setting all the expected conventions on their heads."
4,Comedic Meditation of the Dangers of Romanticism & Media Hype,"This is a wonderful comedy featuring an unusually vulnerable, comedic role for Charles Bronson as an Old West bank robber who gets involved with a lonely romance-addled widow, prone to exaggeration (played by Mrs. Bronson, Jill Ireland) and as a result, becomes an early victim of media hype and myth-making.The tragicomic events that close out the film are absolutely priceless.I hope someone sees fit to re-release this film in a new DVD edition. It's a fun film that deserves a wider audience."
4,Great Movie,"If you like sight gags, this is a great movie. A seemingly dead wife causes havoc for a husband and his girlfriend. Ends with a surprise. by fallingwillow"
5,FSA Orbit Headset,This is a great light weight headset.Good price. Will likely last the life span of the bike.Using it in a Formula BMX bike.
3,"Pretty, but watch the color","Apatite is supposed to be a pretty blue/green color as in this picture. When I received the earrings, I was disappointed with the color. The color is actually a pale blue. They could be mistaken for aquamarines or blue topaz. I like the design of the earrings enough that I'm keeping them even though the color is not what it should be."
1,Way too much,"I try to find the different between this product and the DCS-1000, I couldn't see why this cost so much more than DCS-1000. I think you guys should get DCS-1000 if you really want a web server cam. Forget about this. It is a ripe off with this price!"
1,Bad quality gloves,I would not recommend this product to any one. Had tears in the seams within a week of using it.
3,"A ""frame story"" gives shape to these tales.","Working from a wealth of family stories, Brun has shaped his book around a frame story: his frandfather's tour of France. Even before grandfather began his tour, his father told him a lengthy story of someone who had taken such a tour and had met with fabulous success in his life. On the actual tour, grandfather saw a cruel joke played on a hard-working potter, met a 95-year-old man who spun a story of adventure, heard a tale of three strong men, met a hautboy player who told a tale of wolves, walked a long road with a friend and heard a tale of the brother Batiste and Louiset--one good, one bad. The last story sprang from a wedding grandfather attended and the complete history leading up to the wedding. Grandfather ended his reminiscences with a smaile and a twinkle and the line ""and the cock crew, and my journey ended."""
3,"Good, but...","This was just the thing I was looking for to make bar garnishes. Well made and it would probably be great, but it's made for right handed people only! If you're left handed, stay away!"
5,Another Good Western,Another Good Western with values that kids should be learning today. Gabby runs a ranch for homeless and wayward boys that is about to be foreclosed on. A young boy tried to pay it off with stolen money that his father had given him to hide. He learns you can't do things like that. The other men in the holdup try to hurt him and others. Good movie.
2,Written like a thesis.,"Although this book has quite a bit of information, it doesn't provide much for actual application. It was time consuming and not good for a bride trying find ideas for her wedding. What this book needs is a good index and some copy editing."
3,good book,"I enjoyed this book. As for another reviewer's oppinion that it's all about astrology, did you get past the second chapter???This book is well researched and presents information from many cultures. It isn't suited to someone who is looking to add quirky traditions to their ceremony but more to someone who wants to understand what the rite of passage (the wedding) means globally. It addresses all the stages from engagemnet to the ceremony itself. A very good read."
3,fine,"Very coarse wire. If you want this for aluminum, look else where. They are inexpensive and great for non soft metal cleaning. They will gouge aluminum."
1,Works great but don't drop it,"This is a wonderful carafe, but I dropped it and could not replace the glass liner. Even the Alfi company will not sell direct to a consumer. I was not able to find anyone who carried the liner or would order one so this is an expensive disposable."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This book is merely a rehash of his previous book on this child's murder. The idea that the subconscious mind speaks when the speaker/writer is not aware is not new. This writer depends heavily on the work of his former teacher for his insights. Freud had a few things right--since it was he who postulated the concept of the subconscious speaking out: ie: ""Freudian Slips.""Question for a serious student of this sort of study: Why is the good doctor so fixated on this little girl? He has already done this once. Why not go on to another crime? There are plenty of them around.A final comment: The author's attacks on the prosecutors, commentators, book reviewers--even Joyce Carol Oates--make the question of whether the writer has an ax to grind too important to overlook.Did HIS subconscious speak up, too?"
2,Not Again,The only outcome of this crime that equals the conceit of the parents of that little girl is the greed of hangers onto her memory which would use her death to make a name for himself. Hasn't this person tried this? Why do it again.
1,Absolute crap,"This man started off with an opinion and then analyzed people's words to prove that his opinion of them was correct - - but the problem is, he clearly is a bit of a flake and his thought processes are troubled, do not follow through correctly.He spoke to some people associated with the Ramsey case - - as long as they liked Mr. Hodges, they were treated nicely. When and if they told him they didn't agree with him, they were attacked.The book is very interesting - - as a study of Mr. Andrew Hodges and his overinflated sense of importance.Is it a good book to read if you are following the Ramsey case? Only if you KNOW the case and characters and are looking for a good joke.That's MY opinion. (And I DO know a lot more about the case than Mr. Hodges.)"
1,A book review,"For those who want to have a taste of the book before buying it, I offer what I call a ""companion"" - - it is not intended to replace his work (God knows I would rather just see it burned) but it is a rather detailed review.Please feel free to read, cheer or jeer, and share."
5,A compelling crime-solver,"Hodges' latest book about the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is impressive to say the least. His analysis of the killers' communications is meticulous and thought-provoking. His ability to solve crimes by reading a subject's deeper intelligence is fascinating and will, hopefully, become common crime-solving practice.I look forward to reading more from Dr. Hodges."
2,Not what I expected.,"What I presumed was going to be a documentary history of Westinghouse, complete with narration, is nothing more than silent raw footage taken in 1904 of subjects randomly picked out of context. You get do be a deaf fly on the wall while women perform the tedious task of winding armatures or just filing out after a shift. They take you on a train ride around the Westinghouse factory complex and someone put a movie camera on a dolly and panned backward on a warehouse floor. In another clip we see sections of an electric dynamo being assembled. All of the video is set against a continuous loop of monotonous background music.These snippets are fascinating in themselves as bits of moving picture history but hardly instructional if you want to know more about George Westinghouse and the great company he built."
2,Interesting but no sound or narration.,"This is a set of silent film clips that were filmed in the various factories of Westinghouse at the time. While the background music is somewhat annoying, it is better than nothing at all as in ""The Westinghouse Works Collection - A 1904 Tour of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company and the Westinghouse Machine Company (DVD)"" which has the exact same film clips. This version (with background music) has been cleaned up a bit and has nicer title frames for each segment. Another drawback to this one is the horrible advertising from A2ZCDS.COMIf you really want a history of Westinghouse, then purchase the ""Westinghouse DVD"". This one is very good."
3,This book has great potential but...,"This book presents a wide range of unpretentious recipes from across the U.S. It is something that could only have come from these two amazing women who have been to all these places and sampled a large variety of local foods. The story alone is enough to make it an good book; but one thing makes it an unexceptional cookbook - poor editing. For example, one recipe states to bake for a given time but gives no oven temperature. Another states to add cooked shrimp and then bake until the shrimp are cooked. With so many recipes, you will be sure to find ones that work just fine. However, it is disappointing that a book with so much potential is flawed by poor editing."
2,not impressed,"Not as good as I expected. For all the work that was put into the book, I didn't see a lot of variety. Michigan is well known for the pasties.....where are they?"
3,"DON'T try the Baked Sweet Sauerkraut with Tomatoes and Bacon, page 193!","8 May 2012 - I recently started collecting Gwen McKee's Best of the Best cookbooks after reading numerous reviews. I chose my first recipe from this book and prepared it for dinner this evening. In that my son loves sauerkraut I decided to try the BAKED SWEET SAURKRAUT WITH TOMATOES AND BACON (page 193). IT WAS NASTY AND UNSALVAGABLE AND I THREW IT ALL AWAY!!I can't imagine that the ladies who authored this series of cookbooks actually tried this recipe out before choosing to include it in their cookbook. I originally approached the recipes contained in this and other Gwen McKee cookbooks as being 'tried and true'...but I was wrong.-Now I don't have as much faith in the other recipe I wanted to try next, Baked Chicken Reuben (page 112).How disheartening."
5,La Raza Unida,"En los sesenta y setenta hubo un movimiento que revindicó los derchos de la gente de ascendencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos. Se autonombraron ""Chicano"" para mostrar el orguillo que buscaban en sus raíces.Fundaron un partido político, La Raza Unida, y trabajaron donde estaban de mayoría: en el estado de Texas. De entrada enfrentaron al Patrulla Fronteriza -a pesar de ser ciudadanos- y el Ku Klux Klan. Consiguieron la acaldía de una ciudad, Cristal City, con su programa de derechos humanos y servicos sociales."
3,The best album from japanese pop girl group,"As the members of this group are just around 15~18 years old, the songs from are really quite good. From their first single ""Body & Soul"" to the latest single "" ALL MY TRUE LOVE"", all the songs are above average. Recommend: ""WHITE LOVE"" and Go! Go! heaven"""
5,SPEED IS THE BENT GROUP I`VE EVER SEEN,"When i saw speed album and it`s video clip in here (MALAYSIA), i was really impressed about it i really wanted to buy it. now i`ve already have it...... wuaaahhhhhh!!!!! the album is very great"
1,Missrepresented,"Described as having 5 individual packets within the 5# container. It actually has three large packets which is disappointing because it means a rather large amount has to be unsealed. As the product is water absorbent, that means that unless the product is used promptly, much of it will be wasted. In addition, the picture you present is very different from the product delivered. The picture you present appears to be of the 10 ounce package which contains a 20-30-20 formulation. The product I received is 24-8-16 which is substantially different. I'm not at all pleased!!"
4,My 8 year old loves it!,"My son thinks this game is really cool. I've seen some people comment that they were upset because the dog ""dies"" after 30 days; however, this is NOT the case. If you took GOOD care of your puppy it saves it in a ""never-ending"" mode where you can go and visit up to 3 former puppies while taking care of your new one. After watching him play the game there are a few things I would change...time passes too quickly. If you are actively working with your dog an entire week or more can pass in less than an hour. Plus, you are often interupted when your ""Mom"" calls you to help with dinner or when it's time to go to bed."
4,Great Game!,"This game is really fun! You get to pick your dog, then you can name it, train it, and teach it tricks! You can even teach it to jump, hop, and spin. This is a good game for me because I can't have a dog in this house, and I miss having one. The only thing I didn't like about it is you can only keep your dog for thirty in-game days, and then, if you took good care of it, the dog can be saved into ""Always Together"" mode. In that mode, though, you can't buy things from the stores, and your parents sort of disappear, along with the time of day and the passage of time. Other than that, though, this is a fun game, and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a dog but can't have one."
4,My 4 year old loves it,Got it for my four year old to play on a game boy she inherited from her Aunt! She loves it and it's easy for her to play.
3,The first song makes the whole album worth it...............,"The first song ""Ich Will Nicht Vergessen"" is better than all the rest put together. It is clear, POWERFUL, and uses basic German that is understandable. I only wish the other songs had been that good. Another good one of theirs is ""Das Buch"" but unfortunately it isn't on this CD."
2,Good for a high schooler maybe...,"I don't understand why this got such huge acclaim. This was clearly an amateur book. After the middle of the book, nothing was really a surprise. The plot seemed too far fetched. There was no character development and the characters had no depth.For a high schooler this may be a good thriller/mystery but not for an adult."
1,Stacking the Amazon rating systems deck,"I was checking out the reviews for a James Patterson novel and saw a one-line review that recommended this book. That kind of review always makes me suspicious, so I checked out the other book reviews by the same reviewer and lo' and behold, they were all one-liner reviews of best-sellers that ended in recommending this book. To be fair, I have not read this book so I can't pass judgment on the quality, however, I would be biased against since it seems that the author, his friends, publisher, or someone is trying to stack the Amazon ratings system. Shame on them."
1,Go back and join your parents in the circus freakboy.,"When I stummbled upon this book I was considering purchasing it. However, after reading the reviews I paused to think it over. Every aspect of this book is poor, I thought to give the author a break after discovering his mother and father were brother and sister. then the author tries to get out of the family buisness, traveling in the sideshow of a circus. His mothers act was the hairy, one-eyed man/woman. His father was lovingly called IT.David Demello thought he was to good for the circus, so he wrote this book. Ha, Ha, Ha, a poor attempt from a poor author. Go back and join your parents in the circus freakboy. If you need a real book go check out Arab voices."
5,"Thrills, chills, spills, and kills galore...","I've read hundreds of murder mysteries throughout my years and few leave you on edge like this one. It was extremely difficult to put down. This book gives the true meaning to a 'mystery' because you are constantly left guessing as to who the murderer is. Most mystery novels give away the killer from the very beginning, leaving you only to guess why they committed their crimes and if they will be caught, this one holds you in suspense until the very last page. I absolutely loved this book. Two thumbs up! Also check out Karin Slaughter's Faithless and John Sandford's Broken Prey, two great books as well."
1,1 star is an overstatement,"I couldn't even finish the book...I was willing to cut the newbie some slack, but what with the repeated tears from the main character and describing a meat cleaver as a butcher knife, I couldn't continue to waste my time. Waste of money."
1,One of the worst books ever,"I am astonished at the rave reviews of this book. The writing is what I would expect from my 13 year old son. The dialog - as well as all human interaction- rings false, the murders extra grisly for no good reason, the pacing of the story and lack of depth to the characters leave me yawning as I struggle through it. I am an avid reader, love a good mystery and have rarely come across a worse book. Don't waste your time or money! If I could give it zero stars, I would."
3,The Velikovsky Affair : A Battle of the Freud Wars,"This is the second and revised edition without the numerous errata (the discovered and the undiscovered)of the first one.It is unbelievable that his daughter Ruth Sharon stil supports the 'discoveries' of her father. Isn't she aware of the fact that Bob Forrest refuted all the evidence in 1982 ? As a psychoanalyst she ought to be aware of her self-deception.Nevertheless this is a valuable book with lots of information about Velikovsky's personal life.For instance : there were also small Velikovsky Affairs in his private life, feeling treated dishonestly by architects, landlords, shareholders etc.Another one : his characteristic lifelong procrastination in publishing, reflects definitely his profound inner doubts."
1,Limited Life,I bought one similar to this and the copper plate rusted through in about a year and a half. I've replaced it with a ceramic dish and it's been a joy for the birds since.
3,Penny Apples a good read,"I found the beginning of Ma and Da's married life so sad but their faith brought them through.The parents depended on their children to help with supporting the family. These children learned at a very early age (around 6 or 7)they must work for what the family needed and to work hard.Bill's stories of selling and marketing on the streets of Dublin were enlightening and funny. The Cullen family had to be creative to survive. Read this book a learn how they sold and recycled the daily newpaper. I liked the story of the uncle raising and selling pigs in the city.Bill achiceved everything in later life from hard work and the wisdom he received from his family; parents, grandmother, aunts and uncles. Bill also learned from his teachers, employers and friends.His grandmother always reminded Bill that he had two ears, two eyes and one mouth. Listen, watch and then speak. There are other pearls of wisdom in this book."
1,Not very interesting,I struggled to finish this book. I really did not find it interesting. It is simply a personal memoir and there seem to be no end to the stream of this type of book about growing up in Ireland. Maybe some one who knows the guy or his successful business might find it interesting or would like to know about his family but apart from that he had a uneventful life or not one that was of any significance to read about.
1,Forget this one,"The profits from this book are going to charity. That is probably the best thing about this bloated, self-serving exercisein ego-enrichment. Mister Cullen is a remarkable man and he wants you to know that in a desperate way. He could have saved everyone a lot of trouble and just given the money directly to the charities. Mr Cullen tells the reader that he is not a professional writer. That wasn't needed."
1,Didn't care for it in the least.,"I found it odd to read an autobiography written in the third person. Not sure why the author did this - all I can figure is that there was so much boasting that he would have felt odd stating, ""I, I, I"" as much as he would have had to if written in the fist person. I was not surprised to find out the author divorced his first wife and married a former model - that's just the type of guy I imagined him to be after reading all the bravado in the book. I grew tired of all the bragging by the end - ""ok, ok, you're really smart, I get it"" was pretty much my sentiment as I struggled to get through this."
4,"Not Angela's Ashes, But Bits of Good Irish Storytelling","Somewhat stiffly written, the book offers insight into a closely knit Catholic family struggling against poverty in Ireland. The author's success in business is commendable and he gives credit here to those who helped him along the way.At times, it seems a bit too self-congratulatory, but worthwhile reading for anyone with Irish roots.His childhood memories are a bit more gripping than his adult years. I particularly enjoyed the story where he bought unsaleable plastic dolls and the family decorated them, making a good profit selling them on the street as Marilyn Monroe dolls."
4,An awesome experience,This game is a great game. It has a great story mode and plays awesome you don't have to move around alot and get straight to the action. There are 5 characters to play as 3 you have to unlock and unlocking them isn't the easiest. For one this game can be dificult on all gunners at some points in the game like when fighting warships or cannons. So overall good game one con though that it can be hard at some points in the game and a little confusing.
4,Another great gem from Atlus,"Anyone who watches the opening cinematic and loves it will clearly enjoy this game. It is a beautiful and charming work of art that we have always expected out of Japan. The learning curve is a bit steep, with the controls taking some time to get accustomed to. I was playing on easy and had some challenges near the end, but someone with the right skill can play on any difficulty with ease. I did find it to be a bit on the short side, however. But if you are looking for a unique game to add to your collection, be sure to pick this one up; if you can find a copy."
3,Love on the Rocks,"I love Cassavetes, but I had a hard time getting into this one. Seymour Cassel yells and punches his way through a part that needed more hippie sweetness to win me over. He comes off more like a stalker than a passionate lover--in the end, Gena Rowlands doesn't seem to fall in love so much as cave in. Maybe it's the moustache--I liked him better when he cut it, too! The scenes with Cassavetes as her married lover are electrifying and I wanted to see more of him. This looks like a polished studio picture compared to most Cassavetes films. It's like he was trying to make a screwball romantic comedy in the Hollywood tradition but couldn't help being his explosive, passionate self. Still, some touching scenes (Rowlands drinking with her older friend, Cassavetes coming home to the kids) makes it well worth checking out."
1,You gotta be kidding.....surprisingly amateur!,"This film is shocking in many ways. First that such a first rate director and cast could come up with such a mess. The only thing missing is the shaky camerawork. This isn't a movie.....it's an embarrassment. What's it about? Just imagine a day in the life with some loud mouthed couple who are mismatched and thrown together and someone is following them around with a camcorder waiting for them to kill each other. The only difference is that in this movie they don't die which is a shame considering all the punishment we are subjected to trying to watch it. An eccentric concoction based on a pot brainstorm that isn't worthy of a passing grade in a high school film project assignment. Maybe one of the worse movies I've ever seen. It amounts to nothing more than a loud, eneven, rambling, misguided venture with no redeeming value. Bury it along with Nuclear waste materials and hope it gets destroyed so as to save humanity from it's sheer boredom! Horrible!"
2,Don't Bother,"As the first American soldier to come across the carnage at the Little Bighorn, James H. Bradley was in a unique position to record his sights and impressions. Unfortunately, this book is written in the deadest possible 19th-century prose, so pedestrian it doesn't even walk -- it crawls. Bradley would make a great fictional character in a historical novel, but the real guy has only the most conventional, unimaginative things to say."
1,infare red camera,"The system was easy to install. i purchased 2 additional cameras. The so called ""infare red"" for low light viewing was terrible even in a room with natural daylight you still need light on to view. i am returning all 3 cameras and receiver. I expected better from First Alert. JW"
4,Delightful & Pragmatic: Koning Eizenberg Architecture,"This first monograph of one of Southern California's premier firms is beautifully presented, with extensive documentation (photos and drawings) of numerous projects and critical writings by Aaron Betsky, William Mitchell, and Julie Eizenberg."
3,Can I shoot myself now?,"Ok, Ok, Blink 182 is an alright band. ""What's my age again"" ""Rock show"" and ""Feeling this"" are awsome songs. But this album is DEPRESSING! The lyrics are very dark in a few of the songs for instance ""Adam's song"" is about SUICIDE!! And a few of the songs on this album are REALY REALY bad, like Carrosel. I'm not saying Blink 182 is a bad band just one that needs a little prozac. I find myself skiping through half the songs and only listening to about 6 on the whole album. BUT I'd still suggest buying this album, just make sure you have a programable CD player."
2,Terribly unfunny,"Unless you're a die-hard fan, you're not going to appreciate this. I love stand up and laugh at virtually anything that'll provide a tickle, and this guy doesn't do it. His jokes are terribly delivered and he has this awkward stage presence. Even the audience doesn't really care for his humor... the entire time he just cracks on himself and the delivery of his punch lines are terrible. Don't waste your money!"
4,fun to watch. brings back memories.,"i was very young when i watched groovie goolies in the early seventies. i was 5 maybe 6 and i still remember the episodes even though i am 44 years old now. it brings back memories when i was a kid when saturday morning was an event. kids now treat such things as trivial now. unfortunately now kids can't be kids. the art, the stories, the music, and the jokes still work after 39 years. i recommend anyone who wants good clean entertainment to watch with the kids or their own enjoyment buy groovie goolies. there is bonus footage that is good also but the cartoons are better."
5,Adele Tinning changed my life,"I was luckily led to Adele Tinning following the passing of my boyfriend, Alvin Lorenzo. She made it possible for me to speak to him on his birthday (his 26th) . Adele knew nothing at the time of who I wished to speak with or any of the particulars. Alvin came through loud and clear, a unbelievable experience that moved her friend Helen to tears- I am still so thankful. I remained friends with Adele until her passing a few short years later. This woman was so giving, never asked for money, she only gave and gave to others. I miss her very much, she was so special. I am so thankful that I was able to find her book here (she used to give them to people without charge), I loaned mine out a while back, never to see it again. Thank God."
4,Security and Love,"Little Squib has the opportunity to ""spread his wings"", so to speak, when he ventures away from the loving care of mother and father owl. Their unconditional love makes Squib always feel comfortable coming back for reassurance without an I told you so. As Squib becomes more independent, he realizes that the world can be a cruel place; owls older than him don't accept him into their community. The consolation is that his mother and father are there to protect, love, and nurture. Squib has the most important thing in his life, parents who care!A touching story of unconditional love and security."
4,Good Movie But It Is Not In Color!,"There are several Roy Rogers movies on VHS that are listed as being in color when they are not. This is one of them. They are made by Alpha Omega Publications and are dated Oct. 19th, 2004. This movie is in B&W and not in color."
5,Just what I wanted,Perfect and absolutely the exact thing I wanted to redo an old desk. Brought a Goodwill desk back to life.
3,Anyone as sick of Cloe as I am?,"OK: I like this doll, but I think I'm sick of Cloe. MGAE has made waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many CLoe dolls. I actually counted how many: 28!!! There were 3 collector cloes!!!! I'm thinking that's too much. I like Sasha better."
5,A Beautiful Cloe,"I just recently got this doll--- and let me tell you--- it is just magnificent. One of my favorite qualities is her hair and makeup. Her hair just looks incredible, how it's done. And her makeup is downright drop-dead gorgeous! Oh yeah, and her shirt with the bunny on it is TOO fab. Not to mention her thin, white skirt that supposedly goes with it! Her other outfit is great, too, but her pants are a little weird. But on top of all that, I highly encourage you to get this doll! Such a wonderful value!^Now, that's a review. Remember, this is a shopping site for ALL AGES, not a message board."
3,Eh....,"I was excited to get this toy, then when I got home, I spent an hour trying to get the clothes on. We exchanged it for another one, but the quiality was the same. You could DEFINETLY get a Different brand doll with better quality, for half the price."
1,Bratz . bad ? YES!,"12 - year - old Katlyn Moris sits on her bed playing with her favorite dolls ever - the Bratz. She thinks they make her sound grown up and cool by playing Bratz. She pretends the Bratz are going to parties, drinking and doing other sick things . A week later , she is is caught in her mothers room smoking a cigarette - 3 weeks later, she wears a mini skirt, 10 inch high heels and a see - through top to school, and starts to act all sassy and superfical like the Bratz. She also wears a pound of ugly make up to school. she curses, kicks, and yells at her mom. She threatens to kill herself if she doesn't get her way. Slowly, she starts to get involved with drugs and alcahol and then joins a gang of 'older' girls.....a week after she joins the group...she is found murdered in a back alley....all because of the bratz..."
1,Hey 'Scrap Book Mom 'Nut'',I hate Bratz dolls but my friend Makayla likes bratz dolls and when I handed out a paper to stop the bratty dolls called Bratz she did rudely re-write my work(on her paper only) but she isn't like those other girls who curse and tell people to shut up.Stop saying that all bratz fans act rude!!!!!!!!
3,I LIKE HER IN THE SECOND OUTFIT BETTER.,"WELL SHE'S NOT HIDEOUS BUT SHE'S NOT ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS EITHER. I DO NOT LIKE THE BIG FUNKY BLACK SHOES OR THE DARK RED LIPSTICK. I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT HER HAIR IS PRETTY AND I DO LIKE HOW THE DOLL LOOKS IN THE SECOND OUTFIT. (A PAIR OF JEANS, A T-SHIRT AND HIGH-HEELED SHOES.) THESE DOLLS ALL HAVE A ""DIFFERENT"" LOOK TO THEM BUT SOME OF THEM LOOK BETTER THAN OTHERS. THIS ISN'T ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT IT ISN'T THE WORST ONE I'VE SEEN EITHER. I GIVE IT A 3."
3,stop it your just being silly,bratz cannot kill people janna...bratz can be dressed in clothes and be played with.And if you know some small children are reading amazon reviews and get scared to hear what janna said but it's not true if you say something silly you might as well be mental k. anyway reviews are for telling other people what you think about an item.im doing this for the small kids.
1,THESE DOLLS ARE GHETTO PROSTITUTES,"I would never allow one of these trashy dolls in my house. My daughter calls them ""slutz"". PARENTS NEED TO EXAMINE THEIR HEADS! Well when your 12 year old is dressing this way and has been having sex since age 10, you know who to blame. Their CERTAINLY is a demographic buying this doll, NOT mine. But I do not wear trashy clothes, smoke crack and ""live large""."
5,Gleem Toothpaste,"My grandmother uses Gleem, my mother uses Gleem, my cousins use Gleem, and my Sisters use Gleem. Gleem is the best toothpaste you can buy. Once you try it, you will not like any other brand!!! Try Gleem Toothpaste, and you will love it too."
3,not to bad i guess,not a bad product but other toothpaste out there do a whole lot more than just anticavity which is the only thing this toothpaste does.
1,"Sorry, no ADA approval.","Looks good and I remember it as a kid, but without the ADA seal it is just not worth it."
1,Pond Kit,"This ""kit"" contained a pond liner, pond filter/pump and very poor instruction. Our liner had many slices in it out of the box. We took the pond apart 4 times trying to locate each leak. Still haven't found all of them. You must provide everything to beautify your pond. Threw my back out for 3wks moving rock so many times. If you want a pond...go online and get Directions, then go to Lowes and get your stuff...It is cheaper, in the long run, and MUCH less hassle!"
5,novel which does justice to the complexities of racism,"This is a beautifully written, insightful novel which does justice to the complexities of racial (and gender) identities and interactions in what some refer to as the ""post-civil rights era."""
3,Out of print books,"This book was assigned reading for school. It had to be ordered because it was an out of print book. I made the mistake not to get overnight shipping. By the time the book finally arrived, my son's class had already finished the book and had moved on to the next one! As for the content of the book, my son said it wasn't bad."
5,"Once I got into it, couldn't put it down","Started reading this at 11 a.m. Got distracted by work, kids,chores, cooking, etc., but picked it up again at 10 p.m. andliterally couldn't put it down until I was done; at timestears were rolling down my face as I turned the pages.The three main characters are so brilliantly realized they are indelibly drawn on my mind; as a reader you can't wait tosee what is going to happen when these three people clash,as they inevitably must. It's about race, class, boys, men,women, love, motherhood, violence, divorce - everything thatmatters right now, and the profound questions we face asindividuals and as a society in going forward, in ourrelationships, in our families, and in our institutions.Yet you don't have to care about any of these issues, particularly, to just love this book on a totally viscerallevel. It's beautiful and meaningful, and deserves a wide audience."
4,solid book,"solid, mesmerizing book. I truly enjoyed reading it and it kept me involved the entire way through. I especially was impressed by the author's ability to shift in and out of the three characters without causing any distraction the reader. well done."
4,excellent book,"Sensitive portrayal of a young African-American youth who, still recovering from the untimely death of his older brother, struggles to find his place academically and socially at a boarding school. He finds an ally in an English teacher (who narrates part of the book) and a baffling opponent in an African American Latin teacher who also coaches track. In the end it is the adult who cannot come to terms with his own past who is destroyed by his pride and blindness. Recommended."
2,"Not for younger children, you must be a good reader.","We purchased this for my son's 6th birthday. Luckily we bought it used at Game Stop and were able to immediately return it for another game. There is A LOT of reading very tiny print, words like disinfectant, parasite, infection, and ointment. Definitely not for the younger child. Even for the older it was very repetitive and a little boring."
5,Christina - Valrico,This is the best game EVER....I want to be a vet when I grow up and this game lets me pretend with all the animals right now! FUN FUN FUN
1,Cannot get it to work,"I'm a software engineer, and despite my background, 3 different computers, video driver updates on all, I cannot get this to run. The company's website provides no contact information and is of almost no help.My daughter is extremely disappointed. After hours of work on this, so am I. Avoid at all costs."
3,A Good Kids Game,"I completed all of the objectives of this game in a day. There was really no challenge to it, but it entertained me. It is a good game for young kids, i think they will enjoy it."
3,Not for very young children,"I bought this game for my 7 year old for Christmas as she loves animals and wants to be a vet. I agree with previous reviews in that the game requires a fair amount of reading to ""diagnose"" and ""treat"" the animal patients - and the words used are not kid friendly. Additionally, the directions are vague on how to actually work the game (we still can't figure out how to ""jump"" when riding the horse so we just walk up and down the roads). With that said, she enjoys the game which is why I gave it 3 stars. It is a decent game if you can get it cheap."
4,Little Sister Adores This Game,"I bought this game for my little sister, she's 8, for Christmas. She loves it, and has been playing it until her DS dies every day since she got it. I wouldn't recommend it for any one under the age of 6, as our younger brother can't quite sort it out."
2,"Has a cat named ""Gigolo"" already installed for your child","My daughter loves this toy and has played it a lot since Christmas. Today, she said ""Mom, someone named their cat Giggly-o."" Isn't that funny? I asked how it was spelled..yep, it was spelled more like something else - gigolo."
1,Pet Vet needs help!,"We received Pet Vet this past Christmas. Like the software engineer that also could not get this running on his three machines, we couldn't get it to run on our three machines. We have the latest patches and video card updates, new machines and old machines. My wife teaches phd classes in computer science. I do AutoCAd work. We contacted the company and received no response. We spent a lot of time trying to get this to work. My daughter was very excited and is now disapointed. I would recommend that you avoid this product."
5,The book I was looking for,"I just returned from a trip to Dallas where I toured the Book Depository, etc., and was eager to find a good book that thoroughly and critically reviewed the evidence. This is the one. I couldn't be more satisfied with the level of detail and careful, skeptical analysis. I'm surprised this book is out of print!"
1,poorly made,"they would not drill them selves in the ground because the auger portion is incorrectly made.....you can dig a hole with a post hole digger and install them but that defeats the purpose....the auger spirals up, then flat, then up again, which stops them from pulling them selves in the ground"
3,shelter logic anchors,I purchased two sets of four auger anchors. Product was well made and fairly priced. However did not work at all in my situation because of small rocks and stones under the grass at the site. I was not able to get one successfully into the ground deep enough to be practical.There should be a heads-up about this problem.
1,Do not purchase,"As stated previously these anchors are exceptionally poor in quality and will not pull themselves into the ground without a fight. Instead they will bore into the soil and turn out minor pebbles and such while making zero progress. The auger welds are very small and pathetic in size to say the least, so any resistance is going to break the weld. One of mine broke simply while trying to turn it in the ground with my hand."
4,Worked for me,I used these to replace shorter ones and they worked great. In fact I'm ordering another set right now to use on another canopy that almost blew away because the anchors were too shot.I don't remember having any problems installing them. I just used a huge screwdriver in the anchor's eye to turn it as I lightly tapped down with a hammer.
4,Description of Book by GalereCOM,"This 1977 staple-bound 36-page softcover book (8.5"" x 6"") contains synopses of several scholarly lectures concerning the earliest development of American crafts and arts with recommended readings listed for each subject. It was complied in by the Twenty-Ninth Annual Williamsburg (VA) Antiques Forum. Contributing lecturers include scholars, and curators from major universities and very prestigious museums throughout the nation. Subjects include ""Development of American Porcelain 1775-1850"", ""The Assent of American Classical Silver"", ""Democracy's first Symbols in Architecture"", ""Ceramics in America, 1770-1830"" and much more. It is a very fine booklet for historical American arts and crafts collectors or scholars."
1,No Music and Little Else,"That's right: absolutely NO Oasis music is heard in this entire...well, you couldn't even really call it a documentary! It's just a few guys (and by that, I mean no one of any consequence) sitting around talking about Oasis while some very generic instrumental NON-Oasis music plays in the background. Save your money, and if you want a good doc., look elsewhere, perhaps maybe the film ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down""."
3,Not bad but could have been better,"I *LOVE* that this is in Gurmukhi, but its word choice is WEIRD. What dictionary offers a list of words for ""food"" of which ""khana"" is LAST? Coming from learning Hindi I would look up a word in English expecting to find the Panjabi cognate of the Hindi word that I know, and which I know rfom my Panjabi friends are the most normal choice in Panjabi, only to find odd choices that show infrequent use in panjabi usage online."
2,Not a great deal,"I read the Gurmukhi script and finding a word in Panjabi was really easy, but I found that the balance was not good: 11,000 words from Panjabi to English, and 14,000 from English to Panjabi.I couldn't do the translating assignments my teacher was giving me. I was missing a translation for 30% of the Panjabi words ... He strongly recommended the Patiala University Dictionary and I bought it online the same day I returned this one to Amazon ..."
2,"Two strikes, your out.","A half hour into the first tape the video went bad, retutned it. The next one had warbling sound, returned it and got a refund."
5,Nice Ring.,"This is a nice ring. It sparkles very well. The picture can be a little deceiving. The face is not as round as the photo appears. Nevertheless, the ladies will like it."
3,"Great for male veterans and their families, but...","...as a female veteran the book did not address my concerns as much as I had hoped it would. I passed it along to a male veteran and am hoping to someday provide a like-version for female veterans. The primary difference is that many female veterans (and more male veterans) are coming forward to report sexual assault. As with combat it is not an easy situation and definitely entails many of the same consequences, but with different treatment modalities. There are few places for female veterans to go for treatment and while by law treament is mandated, normally it is not (at least not without fighting for it). The book was helpful in showing some of the resources and encouraging veterans to fight for what they deserve and for that it is quite valuable. It is a good start and very supportive of your other writings."
2,Better choices than this,"35 minutes makes this a short CD, even at the price. Moon River (waltz) has only the first beat (of 1, 2, 3) which makes it difficult for beginners. The second waltz is fine for beginners, not too fast. The Mambos are classic Prez Prado, super latin feeling. Cherry Pink is the classic arrangement with the retardo, so not strict tempo. The Fox Trots are good for box rhythm. The Quicksteps can be danced as swing. The Tango music is too mechanical, and not inspirational for dancing. Peanut Vendor (cha cha) is awful, in my opinion. There are better choices."
4,Good value for your dance music dollar,"This CD presents some entertaining music that is enjoyable to both dance to and listen to. The recording quality is high. After purchasing the first copy for our own dance party use, our club purchased additional copies to give as door prizes."
2,Poor Editing and Filming of Bunko - Wasteful!,"I bought this DVD because its Bunko Kanazawa. Should you? I would NOT recommended this unless you want this in your Bunko Kanazawa's collection. I would not pay full price if there is a use one available. It is not Bunko's fault. She is very easy to direct. The editing is really poor. Jumping from one scene to another, it should have been smoother and more erotic. You get more from ""reading"" Playboy than from this DVD. I gave it 2 stars because of my star ""Bunko"". I would say that the camera and editing work in these japanese AV softcore needs more practices to become good camera and editing people. Thumbs down on this DVD."
4,Good bags...bad suspension system,"I am a contractor and have had several rigs over the years. I found this one and thought for 100 bucks i could get good bags and a great suspension system all in one. Well the bags are great can't be ripped, torn, etc. (this remains to be seen) But like other reviewers the suspenders are not made for people over 6 foot they just dont sit on your shoulders the way they should. I gave them to one of my subs and they work for him but he is also several inches shorter than me. I like the belt it came with but I am so use to using leather I swapped it out for that. My reccommendations if you want just the bags go to menards $60.00 bucks. if you want the whole thing and are under 6ft. then this is a great rig."
3,too many words missing out,"I use this dictionary as an emergency back up, it's OK but it's missing too many common words and it is frustrating when you can't find a word when you really need it."
2,Disappointing,"A rather disappointing compact version of the much better larger format Larousse dictionary. I bought it for travel purposes, and was alarmed at how many French words I encountered on signs, in newspapers and elsewhere which were not in this dictionary. If you're serious about the language, this pocket dictionary is less than satisfying. Even for casual references, I found it less than helpful."
4,Je l'aime; vous l'aimerez aussi.,"Ce dictionnaire vous offre une petite taille, un texte lisible, plusieurs significations et exemples d'usage où nécessaires, et pas mal de phrases utiles. Il suffit pour les nouvelles et pour la plupart des textes, mais pour les lectures plus littéraires, bien sr, il faudra que le lecteur recoure à un dictionnaire commeCollins Robert French Unabridged Dictionary, 8th Edition."
5,excellent french aid,My high school freshman really liked this dictionary for her French III class to aid her in writing and speaking.
4,"Nice show, but there are better ones coming up...","This was truly a volume that can't be missed. The Digidestined try to save Earth and it turns out to be the biggest battle of their lives when VenomMysotismon attacks. Even though there are only WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, they do very good. But I'm not telling you wether they'll win or not because this movie's too good to tell you!"
1,This sucks!!!,digimon is so weak and it's to boyish. at least pokemon has a real story. All the characters are annoying. And the digimon are stupid.
5,I LOVE TK!,This is my favorite digi-video 'cause it's got an ep' featuring T.K.! He's so funny! And the only thing i DON'T like about T.K. is that his hat makes looklike NAPOLEON! Maybe some sense hit him in DIGIMON SEIRES TWO because he got rid of that hat and got one that looks much better!
5,Digimon a delight for kids of all ages!,"Who would have believed that a 38 year old biologist and college instructor could become ""hooked"" on Digimon? But strange things do happen! I found this video to be throughly entertaining, so much so that after watching it at a friend's house, I am going to purchase it so I have my own copy! Awesome action! Gatomon rules!"
3,"For the price, acceptable","For the price, this bench brush is acceptable, however you may expect for it to shed bristles from time to time."
1,Beyond Belief alright!,"This dvd is indeed beyond belief. Beyond belief that a great outfit such as Petra was allowed and enabled to produce such a failure. 1) Petra owes its fans a dvd set that has at least two dvds inside. 2) Petra owes its fans a concert that produces sound and camera work that is a million miles above the filth within this dvd. This dvd is only one in a million representative examples of why ""Christian music"" is made fun of and even disliked by Christians. Petra is not a valid witnessing tool. Those fans who say they were ""saved"" at a Petra show were simply seduced by something called the power of suggestion. Petra is cool but not GOD. Please do not buy this dvd and feel free to check for it in a dumpster at a ""Christian"" bookstore near you."
4,Excellent source for historical cooking,"My mother-in-law found this book at a garage sale and let me borrow it to use as a reference in writing a family cookbook. It's very interesting to read recipes, cooking tips, and the prevailing theories regarding health and nutrition from the early 20th century, especially compared to what is known today."
4,Beading Takes Time and Patience ...,"This book is okay for beginners, but understand that you can't just pick it up and start in the middle. This is one you have to start at the beginning with. And just like anything else, if you are a beginner, you must start 'at the beginning' .. learn what you will be working with and what everything is called, so that you will make your projects correctly and confidently. There are many very smart and helpful tips along the way .. and photos / drawings. The information you need for your projects is there, just apply a little common sense and it will all work out.There is an Extensive 'Tools and Materials' Chapter, granted it should be at the front instead of being Chapter 11, but it is good. Take your time .. read .. be patient. You will be rewarded. Beading is Fun."
2,Beading,Was not too impressed with this book. No enough pictures and instruction on how to create something. Wil order different book in the future.
3,good projects want more details,"For the beginner this book has good layouts and starter projects. For me as a real beginner, I wanted some guidance on selecting materials like wire and thread - this book lacks any guidance on material selection. It does have a very helpful index of terms."
5,Memories,"I was born and reared in Miami, the fourth generation of my Pioneer South Florida family. I was delighted with this book, it brought back so many memories.The old photographs are gems, and the descriptions well written and informative. I enjoyed the ""then"" pictures with the ""now"", in some instances they are almost unbelievable, the Coconut Grove Womens Club little Club House which I went to frequently is a good example, long may it survive!"
1,Not a real game,You cannot play this game. It has like four pieces. It is only for show. I got this for my son-in-law because he collects Monopoly games and it was very disappointing.
3,A great collector's item,"I personally love to collect these board game key chains. This one is both adorable, but not very functional compared to the other games. I am happy to add it to my collection."
5,INCREDIBILE!,"I don't even speak italian and have enjoyed this CD tremendously. Congratulations to the Mina team. This album is just superb. BUY IT, LISTEN, & FLY!"
5,Looks Interesting,LoL. Is that a front cover photo of A-fROD doing the illegal girlie-man move to knock the ball out of the first-baseman's glove?
4,Another version of baseball's Odd Couple,"I have to be honest that I discarded this book after 100 pages but not because it was a bad read. As a Red Sox fan who lives in Mass., much of the story in the book is stuff that we in Red Sox land lived through back in 2004. I found the Yankees stuff to be interesting. Was anyone really surprised that most of the Yankee players hated Alex Rodriguez?For those baseball fans who want to get the lowdown on what goes on behind the scenes with one of the great sporting soap operas in history, then I would pick this up as a primer."
1,Not that bad.,We purchased this to help keep the chickens from pecking each other. It did not stop the pecking behavior. It may work better on other large mammals.
2,"Works, but not practical","I must say this stuff does seem to work well... My issue is I think there should be a warning on the label... I can see this might be great for outdoor farm animals and such, but indoor dogs? This stuff stains blue like crazy(yes maybe I should have though harder about 'Blue Coat'), and it is still on some of my dogs skin 2 weeks later! It does not dry fast as indicated, and it could possibly leave spots all around your house if you're not careful...Like I said, this could be considered partially my fault, but a little warning would have been nice... I wish they could make this stuff clear, then i would rate it 5 stars (and buy it again)"
2,Not even good because it was bad!!,"I bought this DVD because I heard so much about Ed Wood and his classics such as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" but was disappointed.The plot, if you can call it that, involves the slightly scary character played by Ed Wood, himself, inviting models to his house where they all end up gettin' naked. Might sound good to some but this has to be seen to be believed (and that's not a recommendation!).Summary: Hire it but don't buy it."
5,Lo Mejor de Jailene Cintron!,"Este es el mejor trabajo discografico de la cantante y animadora Jailene Cintron. En este disco todos los temas son de mensajes positivos con exelentes arreglos de merengue. De Jailene resalta su gran calidad humana, ya que es sencilla y humilde. En Puerto Rico es una de las artistas mas queridas por el publico. ""Que tu Fe Nunca Muera"", ""Encontre El Amor"", ""Siempre Contigo"" y ""Por Tu Amor Vencere"" son los mejores temas del CD. Este disco fue nominado para los premios Grammy el la categoria Latina de Merengue, la cual gano el tambien puertorriqueño Elvis Crespo. Mucho exito para Jailene!"
1,BAD PRODUCT,"The radiator sleeve will not expand to fit a standard radiator hose. The rest of the sleeves work fine for heater/ac hoses, fuel lines, and vacuum lines. Amazon sent me replacement packages with the same problem."
2,For Old School Cars,I purchased this item for my 95 Firebird. The only thing that fit is the upper radiator hose everything else was a waste of money. This kit is designed for muscle cars not for cars after that era. It said it would fit a 95 Firebird 3.4 V6. I guess that was true if you just count the upper radiator hose. I wasted my money. I hope I can get something for the rest of the parts at a garage sell.
5,Great Product & Great Price,This kit works and looks great on my vehicle. It was also cheaper than my local autoparts store where they wanted $40.
3,Just tip of the iceberg,"A book with impressive photos, yet it only seems to cover a small amount of the possibilities of this great country. I expected a larger amount of possible routes in the many states of the U.S."
5,Very Good. Enternaining and worth every minute of it.,"Excellent book. I take the time to write these words and not only give the 5 stars because I enjoyed everypage of the book. very entertaining, full of info on the Royal navy, the command on the sea in the context of the british empire in the Victorian and later times. Worth your time, no doubt about it."
5,A Marvelous History of A Naval Arms Race,"In this fascinating tale Massie tells the story of the naval arms race between Great Britain and Germany in the decades leading up to the first world war. As he would do in Castles of Steel, Massie concentrates on the personalities of the government and military leaders, who often used the naval race for their own purposes to further their careers or to assuage their paranoia. He stays away from technical descriptions and evaluations, instead concentrating on the storytelling. He relates how leaders of both nations alternated between a fear of out of control budgets and eventual war and the fear that should they appear weak or vacillating to their peers, leaders and subordinates. There are many lessons for the current generation in this tale.I would strongly recommend this not only to those with an interest in naval history, but also to those who enjoy a good non-fiction tale of intrigue, power and conflict."
4,"Very good, but a bit slow","I enjoyed Dreadnought, although I also found it to be a heavy read. Massie's command of the era is superb and this is a book which goes far beyond its title. However, it seemed to me that at times, Massie got bogged down in side stories, mainly concerning historical figures. You'll sometimes find him spending pages and pages on a single diplomat or politician where maybe one or two pages would suffice. In the area of historical narrative, Massie is almost on par with Barbara Tuchman. On the whole, Dreadnought is a very good book and I would recommend it to any lover of historical narrative."
4,Long Yet Very In,"Like my title suggests, the book was a very long one [908 pages in my copy]. Even so, I could not put it down. It was very well written and there were numerous pictures. Massie even included many quotes and letters, diary entries, and the like. I especially liked how he divided the book into a British section and a German one. All in all, if one is interested in this type of book, I highly recommend it."
4,Great for WWI Buffs,"First of all -- you've got to have a real interest in the politics behind the First World War in order to complete this monster. There is some fascinating stuff here!!! The stories of Queen Victoria, Bismarck, the Kaiser, Admiral Fisher, and Winston Churchill were terrific. I give it four stars rather than five because the long narrative can be dry reading at times.Still, if you've read the well-known WWI books already, this is a great read. 'New' history from a unique perspective -- the Royal Navy."
5,Excellent !,"Although the title of this book refers to a type of warship the book is about far more. It covers the origins of the modern navy, Britian at the turn of the century and most important a fascinating history of the origin of the modern German state. Also covered are the events leading up to World War One, personal histories of important figures in late ninteenth century and early twentieth century Germany and as per the title of the book, the origin of the modern battleship. This is an excellent book, one I didn't want to put down, and I strongly recommend it."
5,Excellent work of naval & political history,"I had trouble putting the book down. Mr. Massie covers one of the most critical points in world history in an informative, yet easy to understand format. I eagerly await his forthcoming work on the naval history of World War I."
5,Very Informative,"While I have studied World War One a great deal, I found myself truly amazed at the closeness of Victoria's descendants as presented in this book. The book started out describing the monarchs of the previous generation, their policy makers (excellent treatment of Bismark), and finally key military and civilian personalities and how their actions brought Britain and Germany closer to war, and readied them to fight it.A very good book for anyone wanting to know more about the ""Why"" of WWI instead of the common ""Where and When""."
5,One of Montgomery's best-kept secrets,"If you stopped at ""Anne"" you're missing out. Every girl or woman should read ""Jane."" She's so loveable and steadfast. You just love to feel sorry for her, and then rejoice when she gets what she deserves. And mean old grandmother...well it's nice to see her get what she deserves too. :)"
2,Jane of Lantern Hill,"This is not a review of the book itself.The order arrived much faster than expected which was great.The outside of the book (cover) is great, promising much, however the printing is pretty awful. There are st least 11 places where the print is virtualy unreadable because the text is smudged and the pages being copied look as though they have slipped.Fortunately my daughter (the 2nd copy was a present for her) and I have read this book so often, because it is a childhood favourite, that we virtually know the book word for word but anyone who didn't would have great difficulty following the story in places.Sorry I cannot make this fun!"
3,Different and,"Well, this book is very good,I have to admit. It just isn't really written in the ""montgomeryish"" style we all know and love. You know how Miss Montgomery always includes beautiful descriptions of nature and the scenery? She doesn't do it in this book. If it weren't for the dialogue, I'd say this wasn't written by her at all. It's about a girl named Jane who lives in an ugly house with her sweet mother and her cranky, slave-driving grandma, who interferes in everything and always puts Jane down. Jane feels that she just doesn't belong. Then her long-lost father, whom Jane always assumed dead, sends her a letter asking her to come to PEI for the summer. Then Jane learns that she belongs to PEI, and must decide for herself what she cares about most. If you like this book I also recommend Amy's Promise by Bernice Thurman Hunter."
5,Very cool,"The sheer detail of this book is amazing! He even has brackets [] around quoted text to let you know that it's been modified from what the guys actually said! So you know that everything else is exactly what they said, word for word. This man knows everthing knowable about this stuff without actually being there, and he's written it all down."
5,A Piece of History,"This book is your chance to get a historic document for the next generations. I have a little daughter, 2 years old. One day, I will show her this part of human being history. And surely this book will be the best way to explain what ""we"" did. Even if, like me, you do not have a very nice English understanding, this book is so well illustrated and documented that you will have lot of pleasure to read page after page. It makes the adventure more true, more close of us. It does not kill the legend, it explain why it is a legend. A must on your shelves. Really."
5,The Best !!!!,I`we always been a big fan of the apollo project and i think this book completes my search for intteresting facts about the project and also some taste of what the austronats feelt and thought of their work beeing the first persons leaving earth for visiting another world. This book is wery good and i'm glad that i found it.
5,Best book about NASA'a Apallo manned moon missions,"This is the most well written story about all of NASA's Apollo missions from Apollo 7 to Apollo 17. If you like space travel and can't get enough of the moon landings than this is the book you must have. I thought I knew a lot about the Apollo missions, since I was a Navy SEAL during Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo and had teammates working in these programs, but was not prepared for the detailed documentary and laymen language approach to this book. It is, also, a great reference book with lots of other suggested reading. I couldn't put it down!"
1,Man has Not been to or Walked on the Moon,"I won't be reading this book. It is based on a Real Moon Landing, therefore I will not be reading a book touted as Real based on a Pack of Lies. I give this book a Big Thumbs Down.This book, ""A Man on the Moon"" is a book of Fiction, it's only a Fairy Tale."
5,An Absolute Triumph,"If you are not moved by this book you are either made of stone or are, very frankly, a Flat Earth cynic. This book is one of the triumphs of modern literary journalism. Andrew Chaikin has given us a treasure book for the ages, to replace other worthy volumes that are no longer in print or did not go far enough in what they told us. You don't have to be a technophile to enjoy this book, as technology takes a back seat to the human story provided by the Astronauts themselves. Read some of the other fine customer reviews here to see how highly people value this great work. And you know what else? Apollos 18 and 19 should NOT have been cancelled. If any crews deserved their missions, Dick Gordon and Fred Haise's sure did. Spacecraft and boosters lie around redundant, though surely not unappreciated. WHEN WILL PEOPLE RETURN TO THE MOON? The question should be asked more pointedly now than ever. Come on: LETS GO!"
5,Brilliant! I cried with laughter!,"I saw this video at a friends house, a day after watching Unbreakable, I don't know if this video being offered has the added material, but I bought a copy from a different seller for myself and it is so funny and spot-on!I love this DVD, I watch it a lot.The bonus footage will also make you laugh uncontrollably."
4,A great CD for anyone.,"This album contained all the best love songs from all the best movies. I liked this CD because it had all my favorites. The songs were the originals, buy the original artists, so it was that much more special. This is a great CD, for anyone."
3,"Good soundtrack, unfocused story","There is a great soundtrack of 50s and 50s-style pop songs that you will enjoy. The script lacks direction and focus, though; there is no center. What is this about? The three young guys and their sexual awakening? One guy's mother and her lover? It's hard to tell. This really needed better plotting and dialogue.One funny thing: Russell Crowe can produce a high-pitched giggle--which he does several times during the film--which is absolutely hilarious."
4,Far from Yuen Biao's best,"Yuen Biao stars as a young man who does not know kung fu, but he wants to become a disciple of Wong Fei Hung. His friend Foon (played by Leung Kar Yan) wants to help him out. Leung Kar Yan is just great in this movie. Phillip Ko stars, and wants to get rid of Wong Fei Hung's school. He hires a crazy killer played by Yuen Shun Yi to help him with his evil deeds. It's not a great story or anything, but it's passable. I was a bit disappointed with this movie, but with such a great cast and plenty of good fights, I can't really complain. I just wish the final fight was done differently. Having Yuen Biao not know kung fu hurt the movie, especially in the final fight. I had a good time watching this, but I would put Knockabout, Prodigal Son and at least a couple others far ahead of it as Yuen Biao's best movie.3.5/5I have the Megastar version and the picture quality is good."
3,Contrasting Views!,"I am in general, always diasagreeing with 'Phillie'. My views on martial arts films seem to be the opposite. This film shows technically astute and well choreographed scenes, featuring some of the best names in Hong Kong, in portrayal of one of China's Legends, Wong Fei Hung. I like all martial arts films with good, technical, impressive fights and choreography, and sometimes a few laughs along the way, whereas mr phillie seems to like cheesy comedy more than the art forms we are supposed to be watching! This as with all Sammo, or Yuen Biao films impresses with its mastery of Martial Arts. Lets take thos film for what it is, not put down fight scenes if you don't understand them."
1,waste of good talent,"I didn't like this movie at all....I thought it would be a good movie , because it had Yuen Biao and ""Beardy"" in it..but they don't show off any skills...the fightscenes are really pathetic...better skip this one!"
4,"Useful, Serviceable","I've had this dictionary for years and consult it frequently for the exact meaning of Latin words (as opposed to the meaning I happen to guess at). I use it when working on crossword puzzles or trying to understand legal terms. I've even used it to help me turn an English sentence into a Latin one. Another reviewer mentioned that Latin phrases aren't listed here. They aren't, and that's a big drawback. For Latin (and other) phrases I use the Harper Dictionary of Foreign Terms."
1,Nothing more than a prospectus for hedge funds,"I was deeply disappointed. I supposed this book could tell me a lot how ""successful"" hedge funds operated and profited (I inferred so from the word ""Giants"" on the title of the book and the back cover which promised to explain the strategies and techniques they employ). However, all I could read was plenty of charts, tables and sales talks, very general in nature, the stuff one could get from any hedge fund sales brochure displayed inside a bank.If you wanna know why successful hedge funds profit so, you will be absolutely disappointed. If you wanna select a fund or two from the sea of choices nowadays which suit your investment objectives (profit making for sure) and risk appetite, you will be very disappointed as well. In the rare case you need to write a sales brochure for a hedge fund that you need to put everything positive but vague, it's for you."
4,80's,I first heard this band on a German music channel. They have a nice style if you are into 80's type music. It's upbeat and it has a nice rythem. I highly reccommend it.
5,Love Conquers All,"What a great book! An ""oldie but goodie"" from the talented Nann Dunne, STAYING IN THE GAME is well worth the time to read. Starting with a protagonist who is secretive, talented, and beautiful, yet reclusive and mysterious, this book will keep the reader on their toes until the very last page. The mysterious woman, Shelley Brinton, has a history of transferring colleges, anger problems, and problems with the law. She fits the description of a serial killer who has been victimizing women at local colleges.Despite the warning signs, Angela Wedgewood finds herself undeniably attracted to Shelley. Even worse, the more Angela falls in love with Shelley, the more she fears the dark woman might actually be guilty.A riveting book, with multi-dimensional characters and an engaging storyline, GAME is one you most certainly should not miss."
3,"A decent book, a horrible value","Chances are, if you're in the market to buy this book, it's because it's required for a class. This text provides a wide range of rhythmic exercises that are meticulously arranged in order to ease students through progressively harder territory. Indeed, there can be no doubt that a great deal of work was put into the creation of this book as a very useful pedagogical tool. (Though it should be noted that it is fairly useless for reference.) That said, it is a very slender volume for such a dear price--a very great expense for your average college student. Ms. Hall and her publishers should be truly ashamed to be driving such a hard bargain."
1,Studying rhythm,The book arrived with a really bad smell . I tolerated it for a while and in fact did not touch it for some time thinking the odor would wear off . It did not and eventually I made the decision to return it but found out the 30-day period had expired. I won't be buying a second hand book from this seller anytime soon.
2,"Starlite Orchestra is good, singers are not","I enjoy listening to the Starlite Orchestra for the soothing, pleasant sound. These songs are nice, especially the instrumentals, but I was sad to find that they added singers to many of the selections on this CD. If I want to hear singing, I will buy and listen to CDs with good singers; the singers on this CD aren't terribly good and add absolutely nothing to this otherwise fine ensemble. I wish groups like this would just play the great melodies as a skilled small orchestra and leave the singing to those who do it well."
2,Hello,"Hello!!!!Does anybody realize what they are listening to????? This is ""BUBBLEGUM POP""! Hellooooo?????"
3,2/3 Defective,"I purchased 3 of these for my cages. Straight out of the box, 2 out of the 3 I purchased, the fastener/bolt snapped off of the ring when attempting to attach to the cage. While the bowls themselves are still usable, they're useless to me without the fastening ring to hold it in place on the cage."
2,Exquisite arrangements for your ears and mind!,"This album has two songs that are really good. Encadenado and Ahora se me va. Songs on the cd range from soothing ballads to funk-pop. The overall production is ""A class material"" with many exquisite arrangements, especially the strings. Mijares sings very well on this album and the music was arranged and produced by Juan Carlos Calderon. Calderon is considered one of the most prolific composer of our times. All of his compositions have that Calderonism that it is frequently heard in his music. Although, not a production for everyone, Mijares and Non-Mijares fans could enjoy this album for the quality of the arrangements and structure and because of Mijares' powerful vocals."
4,More Great Articles from Mike Royko,"If you enjoyed reading Mike Royko's articles in newspapers or his previous book entitled ""One More Time"" you will enjoy this latest offering of more of his past articles. He covers a variety of subjects ranging from his beloved Chicago Cubs to politics and civil rights in his usual sarcastic manner. Neither book, however, has had my favorite article entitled ""Real Fans Endure Phonies"". The book is a good read and one I intend to keep for my library."
5,Another great Royko collection,"This book is for those of us who love Mike Royko. It is a sequal to the superb ""One More Time,"" collection that came out last year. This time the introduction is written by former collegue Roger Ebert, who delivers an appropriately poinaint snapshot of the man. Then Royko's own words take over. As always, he is at his best when deflating puffed up politicians or defending the little guy against big corporations and big government. This book adds a bonus of also including the verbal sparring that Royko would occasionally do with readers who outraged by a particular column. It also singles out individual Royko sayings for easilly quotable repeating. Royko was a true Chicago original and perhaps the best newspaper columnist of all time. Reading this book is another reminder of how the void of his absence has yet to be filled and perhaps never will be."
2,Not as good as the first installment,"This follow-up to ""One More Time"" includes more of Mike Royko's Tribune and Sun-Times columns. Although there were a few gems that had been missing from ""One More Time"", most of the installments here fall flat. If ""One More Time"" whet your apetite, it would be better to find a copy of ""Boss"" and see Royko at his best."
4,Maternity panel,Worked real well in the piece of clothing it was purchased for and the girl like it and said it was comfortable.
2,Disappointed,"I've purchased maternity panels at a sewing supply store in the past. They were circular, simply sew to the top of whatever garment, no need to do any other waistband. This is a flat-front panel only. I was disappointed. Shipping was a little high as well. The material quality is a little poor also."
1,Be forewarned.,"Real communication breakdown between buyer and seller here, though not the fault of buyer! Waited two weeks past last expected arrival date, and inquired of seller-twice-with no response. Finally went through Amazon and got a response from seller--an initial promise to make good and get me the product. Then another note saying it wasn't a CD the seller even owned! Finally a refund from Amazon squared things. Will not do business with this seller again!"
4,An Excellent Narrative History from a Unique Point of View,"The author presents the facts of case pretty much as a lawyer would. The presentation appears to be complete and detailed. But a professional historian would have taken a different tack. Personally, I feel that Chief Justice Rehnquist presentation was excellent.I particularly liked the Chief Justice's analysis of what might have been Justice Bradley's thought processes in arriving at his opinions. I do not believe that a professional historian could have provided this type of insight into the situation."
2,Loses focus at the end,"I enjoyed this book and found it very informative about the 1876 election.Then Rehnquist loses his focus at the end, including a lengthy chapter summarizing how the U.S. Supreme Court has played an extra-judiciary role in American government throughout American history. That chapter did not seem to belong in this book. It was as though Rehnquist wrote it as an essay to justify his Court's role in the 2000 election, and he needed a place to put it. I got frustrated and bored during that chapter, and finally decided that I was not obligated to finish it, and I stopped.I recommend reading this book until the last chapter, which you can skip."
1,NO BOOK IN MAILBOX,The book did not come in the MAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never got the BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe it's on it's way!!!!!??????? I hope so..........
4,A Hoot and a Half!,"This movie is fun, engaging, bright, and positive. In spite of some grave misgivings when I started to watch, I was definitely engaged with this farcical comedy. I have finally figured out why I was so taken with it--the animal actors!Part of the appreciation of a work almost always is due to the sympathy one feels for the characters. That sympathy is won primarily by assorted Lemurs, Ostriches, Roos, etc. in this film."
3,"A funny movie with Cleese, Klein, J.Lee Curties and others how can it miss?","Although not a follow-up, the cover, the actors and producers want to bank onthe success of ""A fish named Wanda"" ten years earlier but it is not quite ""there""Still funny and good entertainment. I still recommend it."
5,Such a funny movie!,I laugh even thinking about it. The cast does a great joband animals are cute & cuddly. Don't let the title fool you.Amazon has this and at a good price. Enjoy.
2,DVD 2 stars but movie 5 stars,"2 stars for the DVD itself because of the small screen size at the beginning due to the titles, but it does change to full screen. I find this a bit annoying but we do get to see this great movie over and over. I give the DVD 5 stars for the story. To us it is a classic and if you can get through the beginning part without getting mad and shutting off the DVD player you will enjoy it. You need to see ""A Fish Called Wanda"", also a great film, to understand what John Cleese says at the end of ""Fierce Creatures"". At first I rated this DVD low but that isn't fair to the movie itself. I don't know why they chose to do the beginning the way they did, but most of the movie is in full screen."
2,This film really deserves to be released in widescreen,"Either you love this film or you don't care for it. It alldepends depends upon your particular sense of humor. In my case, Iadore it and find it hysterically funny.My problems with this DVD have nothing to do with the film. Instead, my problems are with the transfer. This disc is one of the worst excuses for a pan and scan disc I've seen. I gave up trying to count the number of times that two characters were having a conversation but only one of them could be seen! Often, there was dialog and you didn't even know another character was even there until they spoke!Even though I adore the DVD format, for this title, buy the VHS version in widescreen instead. You'll get to enjoy the film and actually see the action."
1,What a waste of Robert Lindsay's talents!,"Not to mention Kline's, Cleese's, Palin's and Leigh-Curtis's.......but to drop Lindsay into this nothing role and abandon him is beyond forgiveness!"
2,Not So Great,"Don't go out of your way to see this one. 'A Fish called Wanda', while not my favorite of all time, was definitely better than this. The plot here is very simplistic: save the zoo. It could be for children except for the sexual innuendos. It was more slapstick-ish than clever, more 'cute' than funny.For a great Cleese movie check out 'Clock-wise'. I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,Cleese as Basil Fawlty again! The rest is ho-hum.,"I always enjoy John Cleese in his classic Basil Fawlty role, that's about the only part of this movie I laughed at. There's too much emphasis on the big stars, we never really get to know any of the zoo staff. It could have been much funnier. Get the Fawlty Towers videos if you really want to see some classic British humor!"
5,Fierce Creatures is Fiercly Funny!,"Monty Python fans will really appreciate the brilliant comedic performance by John Cleese. Joining him are ""A Fish Called Wanda"" castmates Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline. This is insanely clever, full of inuendos and ironic twists that will make you laugh and laugh and laugh some more. This is my familie's favorite flick ( my children are 17 and 19) and a real sleeper because no one seems to know about it. Kevin Kline fans will love his duel role as both father and son. The whole zoo business makes it even funnier. Fans of English humor with simply love this movie."
4,Fierce is Funny,"I really enjoyed ""Fierce Creatures."" It's funny,with a wonderful cast! If you liked ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" you'll like this one,too. John Cleese,Michael Palin,Kevin Kline,and Jamie Lee Curtis are hilarious together. This isn't a sequel to ""A Fish..,"" but the storyline and cast interaction make it just as enjoyable."
3,What a disappointment.,"As much as I love John Cleese and the ""Wanda"" crew, I have to say I found this movie severely lacking in the humour, the sexual tension and the edge-of-the-seat excitement I'd enjoyed in ""Wanda"". The beginning scene set the unfortunate tone and it went down-hill from there. It wasn't for lack of trying by the cast. They were, as always, doing their best to turn in top performances but the spark just wasn't there. A waste of their talents and that of supporting cast, such as Robert Lindsay. I have to admit that the final scene held a few laughs but I believe that was more the result of the costumes than the story. I WANTED to like this story. I really, really did. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough substance to hold my interest."
3,Label Is Misleading,"The chandelier arrived early this week and was packaged okay. It was a rather thin, flat box and I hoped when I opened it, the chandelier would be okay. It was. It's a beautiful polished brass and looks easy to install. My brother-in-law is an electrician, though, so I'm waiting for him.The label ""Eight-Light Traditional Chandelier, Polished Brass Finish with Optional Shades"" is misleading. I was expecting to open a package that consisted of eight shades. There was no such package. So, if you want a chandelier with shades, buy one from somewhere else or go out and buy eight shades."
3,Mostly Raspberry in the bags,"I kinda figured I was going to get a ton of the ""undesirable"" flavored candies. I bought this bag to get the hard to find lemon and grape flavored Pez. I got three lemon, two grape and two orange packs. The whole bag was filled with Raspberry flavored Pez (which I didnt even know they made) some Strawberry and some Cherry flavored. I bought another bag for my daughter who isnt picky about her flavors in the bag, but other than that, ill look for an allternative choice for my next Pez purchase..."
5,Suprise,I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present. He is a big Pez fan. It was the perfect gift and a total suprise.
1,thought it was a bag of the rolls not mini rolls,was expecting a bag of the normal sized pez rolls but got 4 piece rolls instead with mostly lemon cherry and watermelon? WTF?
1,WhAt!?,"I give this movie a 1 only because it started out good.In the end, the movie lost my attention completely. It was about an old prison opening up as a haunted house. A bunch of people were watiing outside to enter. (the sound in this movie was like distint and horrible.) The people weren't really good at acting it seemed like, that was a bad part. The haunted house turned out to be really stupid, i think. There was a killer roaming around the haunted house first dressed as Jason Voorhees, than as Michael Myers. It was such a copy of Friday the 13th and Halloween. After that happened, the movie just got lamer and lamer. I really don't reccommend it."
4,CHEAP AND ENJOYABLE SLASHER,"If you only love Horror flicks with big budgets, my bet is you won't like ASYLUM OF TERROR. But if you love cheap bloody slashers like I do, I can not recommend you enough to add that flick to your collection while it's still time.It is, it's true, technicaly inept ( the acting, the editing, the lighting, the sound... most of it sucks )but believe me, that flick is nothing but fun. The body count is high, the murders are nice ( especially the chainsaw scene ) and the general mood is dark, bloody and dusty. Hell... even a child gets killed. In the end, the cheapness of it all makes it even more enjoyable.I give stars to ASYLUM OF TERROR for what it is : a no budget real honest slasher flick for slasher fans."
3,This should not be your first Sitchin Book,"I found this book to be a dry and difficult read. The author obsesses over the research examples. I would suggest you start with ""There Were Giants Upon the Earth: Gods, Demigods, and Human Ancestry: The Evidence of Alien DNA"" also by Sitchin. It is a much easier read, akin to a ""Coles Notes"" version. If you like that and want more details and examples then by this book, or simply continue with one of his other books in the series. You don't have to buy into all of his theories to make this a worthwhile read."
2,"Interesting, but no proof.","The Angel HunterI will say from the gate, I enjoyed this book. The ancient history and cosmology theories were very interesting.The problem with this book however,and all the way back to Chariots of the Gods by Von Daniken, is that it always ends in the same dead end for me. Where oh where has just a little proof gone? If an advanced race, alien or terrestrial, spliced DNA to create thinking man, there should be at least some technology buried or abandoned somewhere on this Earth to validate such events. To date, I have never seen CNN reporting from a dig that uncovered an ancient launch pad or ancient biological laboratory. The book is worth reading only for food for thought. If you are looking to this type of writing as validation for your belief in ancient astronauts look elsewhere. The proof may be out there... but it is not in this book."
3,thought provoking,"Although it remains to be seen if Sitchin's theories are true, it is a foolish person that walks the Earth with a closed mind. If history has taught us anything, it is that man is infamous for criticizing and scoffing at new ideas and strange phenomenom that later turn out to be fact. Open you minds before it's too late."
5,The Twelfth Planet,"I send or give this book to my friends because it is so vision-stretching. Sitchin is an acknowledged expert in reading original texts in cuneiform. He has traced the writings of all the ancient civilizations back to Sumeria. He proceeds to tell you of the Gods of the Twelfth Planet and how and why they came to earth, among countless other fascinating translations of the ancient texts of Babylon, Ninevah, Jerusalem and others."
5,"A child's question, a life's quest.","Book one of the Earth Chronicles, by Zecharia Sitchin, is the first book in this now classis series.As a child, the author had a question about the ""giants"" mentioned in Genisis in the old testiment. His innocent search for answers began a lifelong search through time, history, legend and theology. His scope and his scohlarship is stunning. He is able to make very persuasivearguements in support of a long hinted at but rarely spoken of real history of our planet."
1,Just two questions...,"When planet X approaches the inner solar system, shouldn't it disintegrate like a giant comet?How can a planet beyond the orbit of Pluto support life?If humans are supposed to be created in God's image, then shouldn't the aliens from Planet X being human-like? That would imply that they need water, sunlight, oxygen, photosynthesis, and plants/animals to survive.Like they say on those CSICOP tee shirts, ""I doubt it""."
5,i love it!,"this book is fascinating and makes me look at all the ""gods"" in a new light. people definitely need to expand their mind by reading the 12th planet"
1,How Insulting!,"I have always been interested in alternative views of history, in particular in ancient civilizations and human development. While this book did entertain a different perspective, Sitchin made the mistake of presenting his preposterous theory as though it were already proven fact. His ""evidence"" appeared one-sided, as though it could not mean anything else. It was apparent that he manipulated texts to support his idea. At first, I found this book entertaining, something to laugh at when I was bored. After a while, however, it just became overbearingly insulting. He must have thought that people were gullible or so uneducated that his theory could be taken in. Parts of the book made me scream ""My God, you are an Idiot!"" I'm actually trying to get my money back from the publisher for subjecting me to this nonsense."
2,Credible research but lacks perception found in genetics,"Mr Sitchin's research is comprehensive and I respect that he is entitled to draw whatever conclusions he likes, but I feel that a much more genetically sound theory for the origins of our civilization are found with Daniel Quinn and The Ishmael series. If there was an alien race they were called the Takers, and we are now them!"
1,Absolute Garbage.,"If you can read the languages that he claims to be able to read, it takes all of 2 seconds to tell he is a perfectly self conscious fraud. See Micheal Heiser's website ""Sitchin is wrong dot come"", for a detailed critique."
3,"Interesting, but questionable...","I do concur with the basis of what Mr. Sitchin has delineated in this book, that an advanced extraterrestrial civilization visited this planet sometime durring our antideluvian past, but I think that this volume raises more questions than it answers. For example, according to Mr. Sitchin, what we know now as the human race was geneticaly engineered as servants to extractgold from African mines. However, if the Annunaki were so scientificly advanced, why could't they have developed machines to fofill the role, or better yet, synthisize gold from other elements? I do not wish to invalidate the research in this book, but some of his assertions just don't make sense to me."
4,sons of gods...,"Reading Sitchin is more than worthwhile because he presents mankind's ""history"" in a way that forces the reader to ask important questions, re-examine conventional doctrines, and begin redrawing his map of reality. One can begin with Sitchin, but he should not end there, else he conclude that the truth about our place in the universe is far simpler than it actually is. The evidence that earth was visited and periodically colonized by ""gods"" is overwhelming. (They continue to visit - who knows, maybe they do R&R here as well.) That they bio-engineered ""man"" in their image to serve their purposes, more than plausible. Likewise their being responsible for megalithic monuments, numerous myths, etc. But Nibiru - a 12th Planet in our solar system - being their home - seems the least plausible and overly simplistic."
3,Pretty Crazy.,"To accept Stichin's theory, you have to buy in totally to what he says. There is little middle ground here. This is easy in the beginning because a lot of space is devoted to showing the similarities in Sumerian, Greek, and Akkadian pantheons. However, the book quickly moves into alternate interpretations of ancient texts that indicate the gods were really from a ""12th planet"" that orbits the sun every 3600 earth years. Oh, and these gods created mankind to work in African mines for gold (after the gods got tired of doing it themselves.)I'm not sure you can be critical of this book without going back to the source documents because Stichin freely admits that his interpretations are not always what other scholars believe. As fiction, the book stands on its own. As a serious work, it lacks in scientific proof. Take it as you see fit."
3,Sitchen claims a great deal,"I've studied Sumerology for quite awhile. Sitchen claims that he has discovered new and fascinating evidence previously unknown to Sumerology. This is completely bogus, he twists and perverts the mythology profoundly. He studies the Torah and makes elaborations in comparison to the Sumerian texts from which they draw influence. He mixes and matches as it supports his research. Sitchen is not one of the few scholars who can read cuneiform, he is one of the many. Not to say that deciphering the languages of those early Semites isnt impressive, but he is NOT one of the few. Less credit for this author is due, but he still deserves kudos."
4,Fascinating Read!,"THE TWELFTH PLANET is a very detailed and fascinating read. There is much information here that only became available when the Sumerian language was deciphered. I couldn't give it all five stars because so much detail becomes tedious. For folks who really, really want to know the historical truth about our beginnings, be ready to read into the night spellbound. I haven't had a full night's sleep since I started this book."
3,the 2th planet,"this book is certanly detailed about acient gods and civilizations.while i find alot of parts interesting i must say i find myself skipping over some sections because of information overload.the autor has certanly done his research and full credit to him.if you are interested in topics like ancient gods {aliens}seeding mankind and starting civilization off and the theory of the 12th planet{which i am}.then this book would have to be the bible of the subject.overall good book ,just be prepared for the most info on the subject you have read.possibly need to read through again to fully grasp it."
1,Boring 12th Planet,"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive and boring. The author talks about planets as if they were actual godlike people. Struggled to get through this book as I kept falling asleep while trying to read it, even though I am convinced that the ancient people of earth could not have accomplished some of the great works of architecture and building without some outside help. Maybe it is just me. I know a lot of research and work went into writing this book, but I could not get into it."
2,Was this meant to be taken literally.,This guy must have had a crystal ball or magic mirror explaining this crap to him because it's just too amazing that this guy has figured all this out while scholars the world over have never seen anything in ancient sources to justify any of the assertions this author is making. Unless of course it's not to be taken literally.
2,Did not enjoy this book,I feel thaT this book goes into far too much refernce material and details about names that i could not relate to or remember. This did not interet me at all.
5,Incredibly Detailed Book,"By readingThe 12th Planet, very early on one comes to realize that Mr. Sitchin knows his subject very well. The paralelles he draws are so incredibly detailed and meticulously documented that he leaves no doubt in one's mind that he is at the very least a master in the sciences, religions, history, and languages of the ancient past, as well as the present. Thank You for writing this amazing book Mr. Sitchin. You have gained a loyal pupil."
3,I Believe,"Unfortuantely I only read this book after ""Gods of The New Millenium"" by Alan F Alford who has taken Sitchins theories one step further but leaving that aside - I always seem to find the theory of the Nefilim very interesting - I dont know about the others but I believe that something like what Sitchin theorises did definitely happen - cause if I think about it there is no other explanation niether in philosophy or religion which can explain the ""Gods"" as well as Sitchin does - all I can say is that it opened a new way of thinking for me and helped me explain a lot of the questions that I had in my mind - Mr. Sitchin I am a believer"
5,"If true, WOW!","This is a very good book to read. This book is Sitchin's interpretations of ancient Sumerarian writings.These writtings talk about how an extraterrestrial race from a planet from our own solor system called Niburu came to Earth and created humans as a slave race. Sitchin links the Annunaki with the Biblical Nephilim. This is an exciting book to read, maybe his interpretions are correct, if correct then the humaan race has a lot too think about."
3,Just The Facts...Please,"I liked this book, though a dry read. I wish Sitchin would have just presented the evidence, rather than ""stretching"" it to fit his idea of things. He has done his homework for sure but I don't agree with all his conclusions."
2,Not as cross-disciplinary as suggested in the text,The book is interesting and suggests extraterrestrial intelligence at work way beyond rational and scientific findings. I don't believe a reach into the scientific through biblical and ancient texts is as convincing as Sitchin would want us to believe. I didn't think enough cross-disciplinary research was looked at in support of the conclusions about human origins and planetary behaviour. I think Graham Hancock's theory about ancient civilization is more convincing than Sitchin's although Sitchin is more entertaining and not as arrogant as Hancock.
3,Our history,"Sitchin brings the reflection of may happen in the begining of our human history, is open mind not traditional reading."
5,As expected.,"If you are a Zechariah Sitchen fan, or a fan of the Ancient Alien series or similar work, you'll appreciate these. They are a rather slow read, though. Lots of details."
5,My wife thanks you for this one.,"My wife had been bugging me to find her a new copy of The 12th Planet for months and I had been busy doing other things and couldn't easily find the book for her. One morning while reading my e-mails I opened an e-mail from Amazon with an offer to purchase some hard to find books, so I looked for a few minutes and to my surprise there was the 12th Planet...needless to say my wife got one of the best surprise Birthday gifts she could have hoped for."
3,Pretty cool concept.,Pretty in depth research on summeria. more then ive seen elsewhere. i find stuff like this to be as much up for consideration as say the bible or any other early books on what happened in the early days of man. my only complaint with this as in everyone one of those other books is that they are all steering you in a way to find the same answers and explanations that they did when there may be other answeres or explanations. All in all i found it very in depth and interesting but also boring at times. The factual stuff about how most religions have the same amount of gods in early religions and the same exact stories from religion to religion is fun stuff to bring up at parties or when you have self righteous people trying talk about religion. most of them dont know anything other then whats in their book and most people dont even have full understandings of whats in their book. Ask a christian about the nefilim and see what they have to say.
5,TThe 12th Planet,I haven't read this completely but consider it to be an Excellent source of Information as to the Likely hood of our past and origin.
1,Hello!! Please turn on a brain cell or 2!,"Okay, so aliens. Fine. But who made the aliens? Other aliens? Who made them? As a very wise man once said, ""the simplest explaination is the correct one"". This is not. Its properly categorized as Sci-Fi. If read in that vein, well its just dull then."
1,Garbage,"This book is just crazy. Proves that if you keep an open mind, people will chuck all their garbage in it. If you believe any of this, get your relatives to send for the men with the white coats and butterfly nets.Scientific and archeological gibberish and nonsense."
2,No easy read. Is it true?,"There are books that ring true - Marciniak, Stibal...then there are those who ring false...gerard the borower,and those that ring with questions and starr the complicated. This book took a lot of effort. Life need not be such hard work. Life needs to be oly peace and love. Give peace a chance."
2,The 12th Planet,Sorry I bought this book. It's like trying to read the Old Testament. Boring! Maybe it gets better but I don't think I can wait.
2,Science fact for those uneducated in science.,"While I appreciate Mr. Sitchin attempt of bringing in numerous texts from a variety of ancient peoples, his spectacular interpretations are usually unjustified and redound in conjecture. This book is in the very least full of interesting ideas, which may inspire some enough to accept his lack of evidence."
4,Excellent alternate view of history,Highly recommend for those with a religious background who didn't quite buy the explanations of the seeming inconsistencies in the Genesis stories. Worth wading through to the final chapters where everything really comes together in an explanation of Biblical bersions of Adam & Eve and Noah that is definitely worth pondering
3,Australian Fan,"I have mixed feelings concerning this album. For starters I first purchased this CD around 2005 (produced by Nekko records)and noticed that 20 seconds before the end of track 11 there is a ""hiccup"". The problem was always there when played on several different CD players and believed it was a fault in the pressing. Also in comparison to the vinyl stereo LP I have, the bass is lacking.All tracks though are fabulous arrangements and are a tribute to the amazing talent of these 3 musicians. I played it so often in the car that it wore out and so recently reordered another copy. To my great disappointment I find again that 20 seconds from the end of track 11 is the ""hiccup"".Why are Amazon marketing imperfect CD's? After complaining they refunded my money. If this album is selling well why don't Amazon approach CBS who produced the original LP to press a decent CD without imperfections?"
5,PAGE TURNING TRUE ADVENTURE,"I am an avid reader of all types of books, fiction and non-fiction. This is by far, one of the best books I have read in a long time. The author did her research well and wasted not a word. This book is a bittersweet story of life. I didn't want it to end."
5,Wonderful Read,"I found it hard to put this book down. Ruth Harkness, who was rich in bravado and adventure, stood out like no other woman in her time. When I finished, it did indeed feel like a great adventure had come to an end."
4,Portrait of a Unique Woman,"The Lady and the Panda is the story of love and greed - love between the Lady, Ruth Harkness, and the panda and the greed of the rest of the world. Harkness was an unlikely adventuress whose goal, contrary to the norms of the times, was to bring back a live panda. Her reasons and actions were sometimes questionable, but the end result has been the saving of a magnificent animal and a wonderful environment, which is probably home to many more plants and animals that have in the mean time also been protected.Vicki Croke has crafted an engaging read here. The prose is fluid and paints a vivid picture of Harkness, Western China in the 1930s, and greed for money and fame that surrounded the capture of the first live giant panda. She document's Harkness's struggles with depression, spirituality, alcoholism, and lust while still portraying a very unique and inspiring person. This book is well worth reading for those interested in either travel and wildlife preservation."
1,The Lady and the Panda,"I thought the book was horrible. I am a true animal lover and find killing animals to be disgusting. The poor pandas that were captured suffered horribly and many died. Ruth Harkness said she loved the Giant Panda but she contributed greatly to the frenzy of hunters capturing and killing them for ""fun"". I bought this book based on the reviews I read here and was extremely disappointed and disgusted with the book."
1,Terrible book about a panda KILLER,"If you want to read a hack writer glorifying a selfish, unscrupulous ""explorer"" who bankrolls the indiscriminate slaughter of pandas by hirelings while she lolls about in silks in a palace smoking opium, this is the book for you. Ruth Harkness was a vile, unprincipled woman of privilege who lied, drank, and fornicated her way into history by returning the first captured panda to the United States--after cutting a deal involving the shooting of other pandas--then spent months trying to sell it to the highest bidder. As soon as she did, she returned to China to wreak more death and mistreatment upon the species.Most of the reviewers here must have skipped over the scenes where these woeful victims are abused, mistreated, and left to die by Harkness when another, more promising animal comes along. Actually, this is not surprising, because no animal lover could finish this ghastly book, which is very poorly written into the bargain. I know I couldn't."
4,"Great little bag, lots of organization for the space!","This is a very handy toiletries kit - the shape fits in my luggage easily. Love the hanging hooks, the shower insert.... easily tall enough for full-size deodorant (why don't deodorant companies ever make travel-size in the UNSCENTED??? but that's another issue, LOL). I'm a low maintenance kinda gal though; I packed some Bare Minerals makeup, shampoo/conditioner, deodorant, comb, makeup brushes... also fit in a Bare Minerals boxed kit (still in the box to try). Had sanitary supplies, toothpaste, toothbrush - those outside pockets are really handy for them - also a lash curler, face lotion... anyway, more than I usually carry. It was perfect for me! The materials also seemed very durable, easy to to wipe off, great-sized zipper pull.That being said - having seen women in the locker room... many ladies may prefer the larger (9"") version. After submitting this review, I'll add a ""customer image"" of all the stuff that fit in mine (the 7"")."
5,Nice almost Great Used on Cruise Ship,Nice for traveling when space is limited (packing and well as small rooms)Easy to see and hard to lose. Holds enough for most men that do not use hair products.Would buy again and recommend for men.
4,Good value for money,"Just bought this bag and having researched several others I might say this is a very good deal. Several small compartments, the (controversial/not useful to all) small mirror, and, above all, a very reasonable price tag. Would just buy their 9"" one instead, as I found this one a little too narrow... (for someone favoring a really compact one, this is the best...)"
4,i just really need to be impresed to give 5 stars,"its really good toiletry bag, full of pockets, built in hook, side pockets.i would classify it in the small ones of its kind, which is good if thats what your looking for, anyways i fit there:-electric tooth brush, finger nail clipper, small electric razor, 88ml hand lotion, 250ml listerine, 250gr old spice deodorant, 3pack condoms, chapstick, tooth floss, 100 ml cologne and there still a little room.oh it also comes with a little mirror... might come in handy on my nest trio to the jungle, wait am I taking the electric razor with me?"
5,"over-all an incredible CD - acoustics, lyrics, everything","Col. Bruce and the Rescue Unit join together to form a jazzy, Widespread Panic, Phish type of music. If you're a fan of that type of music this CD is a must for your collection."
2,My son begs me to turn this off,"My 16 month old does not enjoy this DVD. I think the abstract colors bother him. For example, a dog will be shown in bright colors with black and white patterns thrown in. I'm sure this is to capture a baby's visual interest, but my son doesn't understand why this dog doesn't look like a dog! I don't recall any live action in this DVD, which seems to be more interesting to my son at this age."
1,Too slow....boring,"I have one year old triplets and went looking for DVDs similar to the Brainy Baby series, that they love. I tried these, but they are SO slow paced, and the voice-over is so monitone, they lost interest quickly. The pauses between stories and words are too long and they would move on to play with something before the next section began. I will not purchase any more of this series."
4,Good Snapshot in Time,"This short documentary shows how the division of labour and living conditions at a large Southern planation have changed over time, from the antebellum to Jim Crow periods. The narrator assumes that the contemporary conditions are ideal, and so the documentary has some additional educational value in revealing the implicit biases of the time it was made."
5,a must have,a must have if you are a Barnabas Collins fan..pick this one up ...especially now that Jonathan Frid recently passed away!
3,my reviews,its okay i thought it would be better i dont think it was that good and could of had better vampire showings
4,Easy way to make chicken with balck bean sauce,I love this product and all the Lee Kum Kee products! I use this when I want a fast way to make chicken with black bean sauce instead of going through the trouble of soaking the black beans and making the recipe from scratch. Very tasty!
5,Should Be Called Lightning In A Bottle,"The mixing of crazed bitter folkie Chesnutt and jam band Panic in unexpectedly pleasurable. The combination is pure genius, pure gold. Panic's playing is excellent as ever, and is improved by the resistance to the impulse to jam. The result is infectious, mesmerizing and divine. Every track is superb, especially worthy of note is the mournful, haunting `Westport Ferry', the funky, groovy `Alright' (both versions) and the poppy, irresistible `Good Morning Mr. Hard on'. The group will please fans of both bands, as well as fans of bands as diverse as The Dead, Bicycle Thief and Bap Kennedy. It's a must have, an album that gets better with every spin. Spin it now."
4,Interesting,"FYI...I am coming at this album from the wsp angle and not that of a die-hard Vic fan. Cool little album, and nice to hear some songs in Panic's repertoire as they started out.Buyer beware: Do not purchase this if you are in any way expecting a wsp outing. Nice collaboration though."
5,Sweet...No fotin'...Smith loves it,"A treatin' masterpiece...Have to agree with Jostski on this one...""Let's Get Down to Business""...Tremendous...Wooo-Weee Doggie!!!"
3,Not the best book on the subject,"The Burgess Shale is interesting in itself as well as for the deeper points that it makes (or rather than people make with it) for evolutionary history. Conway Morris' updated explanation of the fauna from the Burgess and recent research into similar deposits in China and Greenland is important but suffers in comparision with A Wonderfull Life. It is simply not as detailed or engaging. As for his larger points, Conway Morris points out several flaws and hidden assumtions in Gould's work but his conclusions are themselves quite weak. His later book Life's Solution does a much better job at presenting his points and marshalling evidence for them, even if they still, in my opinion, remain unproven."
5,"English for the Spanish Speaker,",This one of a series of books to help Spanish speaking individuals to learn English. They are lovely and most practical for students new to English.
5,An undiscovered classic,"This little-known book is, IMHO, one of the greatest books ever written. Reading it as a boy, I was puzzled by how it made everything seem so real in so few words - everything in it seems to have a life off-camera that we had just glimpsed part of."
4,"Cool book, a little pricey though","This is pretty interactive,with all the foldouts and inserts that come with it...probably one of the better pirate books I've ever seen!"
3,Pirate Popup Book,"Great book for kids-preteens to learn about Pirates. Lots of ""swag"" to open up and look through, from official looking orders and rosters to currency and even your very own pirate flag.Something neat to browse through and get some neat details and tidbits but certainly not an adult book"
1,WORST INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO EVER!!!,"DONT BUY THIS IS DVD..... THE WORST INSTRUCTIONAL KITTING DVD I'VE SEEN,,, JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS KITTING... VERY SHORT AND DIDNT LEARN NOTHING FROM IT.... ANY OTHER KITTING DVD IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE..."
3,Helpful...,"I took on a sudden urge some months ago to start playing a hand drum, and to bring some kind of community drumming to the area where I live (a small city). I chose this book because it was cheaper than the others (a limited budget!) and had a CD in it. The book was helpful, and helped me gain some insight into drum circle building. I would say that one of the cons is that it tends to read a little bit like promotional literature from the Remo company, and it seems to have a little too much hype for the author and her Remo sponsored circles. However, there is helpful material in it, and I am satisfied that I got my money's worth."
4,A keeper,"Christine is on her ""A"" game with this book. Chock full of information and insight, the ""Art and Heart of Drum Circles"" should be on every facilitator's reading list. The included CD makes for great audio reference to material covered in the book. If you have not gotten a chance to see Christine facilitate a drum circle, she is even more fun live. Good job!"
4,Great CD and Good Tips,"I really liked the cd with this book. It helped to generate new ideas and revitalize our drum circle (DC). There are also a number of good tips for running a DC. The reason it gets 4* is that it focuses on facilitated DCs and we like a more ""free style"" circle. Still many of the tips are applicable and it has made me consider doing some small amount of facilitating just for variety."
4,Comprehensive,Haven't read it from cover to cover but it looks like it covers the important stuff. Has great ideas for someone learning to be a facilitator. Have not listened to the CDZ but s great add-on.
3,German thrashers are back!,"This is the long awaited followup to Sodom's 2001 release ""M-16"". On this new, self titled cd, the teutonic trio show they are more than just speed and fury. They go for a slightly different sound, even utilizing acoustic guitars! It all works brilliantly though. If you like Sodom, you will probably like this CD - if you aren't already a Sodom fan, check this out - it might change your mind!!"
5,Pure Thrash!,"If you want a pure thrash album with no frills, be sure to pick this one up. Solid guitar playing and memorable hooks make this a great album."
4,"Enthralling, thoughtful, and sobering, but with a few warts","Fradkin travels the length of the San Andreas by car, by kayak, and on foot, describing its perils and its history. Into his story of the San Andreas he weaves parallel threads about earthquakes elsewhere, always playing up the public's denial of earthquake hazard.As a seismologist, I found the book often irritating (right down to its title: there is no evidence that the San Andreas has ever suffered a magnitude 8 earthquake or that it ever will), and sometimes too dramatic, but in the end it left me with a feeling of chagrin. Fradkin put together a good, coherent story of the San Andreas' hazards, but to do so, he had to fight his way through arcane jargon. His comment that the scientists don't know how to communicate makes me squirm, but it is absolutely right.Not only is this a must-read for anyone within 200 miles of the San Andreas, it should be required for all seismologists and emergency managers who ever have to talk to the public."
2,A 3.0 on the Richter Scale -- Barely Registers,"The author-notes at the end of the book claim that the author once shared a Pulitzer Prize for journalism. He must have had one heck of an editor then, and he sure didn't have one for this book. Disorganized in the extreme, the prose can vary from scientific jargon to conspiracy theory to personal snarky-ness within a single paragraph.You have a subject that should be inherently interesting -- the destruction of the state of California -- the true ""Big One"" that would make Katrina and New Orleans look puny by comparison. But work your way through chapter one, and you'll see why I found this one remaindered for 49 cents at Final Markdown!"
2,A scholarly study - not for the casual reader,"Although the book could be praised for its excrutiatingly thorough detail, I was personally disappointed. The book is more suited to a ""credit class"" scholarly group than the casual reader, such as I, searching simply for an entertaining understanding of the event. Despite the fact that the author includes minute detail such as pay records, important illustrations such as maps relating to the campaign and battles are not included in the text at point of discussion and lack clarity when found in the Appendix. Adding to my personal confusion was the omission of a glossary defining a multitude of terms which would be familiar only to those with a background in medieval warfare."
3,"Good, but a little dry","For the non-specialist, this book might be a bit too much. Also, the paperback cover really looks like it is for assigning to undergrads."
5,A masterful telling,"An extremely thorough and engaging effort. Clearly, Curry has done extensive research in this 'new history' of the battle of Agincourt. Never has there been a better portrait than Curry's of the strengths and weaknesses of Henry V, and the army he led.Highly recommended for those interested in an in-depth consideration of this important historical battle. The Notes, Appendices, maps and Bibliography would lead one to think that only historians will be led to this book. However, even an interested hobbyist or layperson will find it highly engaging reading."
1,Poor Quality,"Unfortunately, the quality of this CD is very poor. At times it is not audible. Many years ago I was given a tape of this music, but it broke so I decided to purchase the CD. What a mistake. Something must of happened in the production, because the tape was perfect. Total waste of money."
4,soulful Chick,"Atlanta bluesman Chick Willis moved on after Ichiban Records folded and has recorded for various companies including Paula, Rock House and Deep South. `I Won't Give Up' is the only CD he made for Johnny Rawls label and it is a good one, with Rawls providing a fine band (including a two piece horn section) and penning several of the tracks. Of course, this is Chick's album and he also contributed several songs, including the very nice ""Hattie"" and a pair of straight-ahead blues cuts ""Spring Time"" and ""Hurt Me So"". The majority of the disc leans more towards Southern Soul, with tracks like ""Sweet Woman/Sweet Man"" (a duet with Rawls daughter Destiny) ""Keep on Singing the Blues"", ""Won't Give Up"" and ""Got to Find a Cure"" sticking in the down-home soul vein. Despite the leaning towards soul and the lack of any raunchy tracks, this ranks as one of Chicks finest albums and any of his fans who don't have it yet should get it!"
2,Disappointed,I bought this as a Christmas present for my brother because my boyfriend had gotten a similar one for free from a Mexican restaurant and it worked great. Even though the Be Open bottle opener seemed to be of higher quality than the plastic version that my boyfriend has it still takes at least two tries to get the bottle cap off. I was disappointed with the product although I still think the idea is great.
2,Works as a great novelty to show off to friends but quality is horrible,"At first this thing worked great it took the bottle cap off every time. It was awesome, but after about 5 months of rare of use, the spring got shot and it started taking about at least 3 pushes to get the cap off. Quality should have been much better. For what I paid for, the quality was way too low. I would recommend this only if you plan on using it once maybe twice a year tops. You know maybe use it at Christmas and show it off to your extended family but other than that it'll just make a nice paperweight."
5,GREAT GIFT IDEA,I loved this so much I purchased 8 of them and gave 6 away as gifts. Many people comment on this opener and ask how to get it. It is a must have.
1,Doesn't work,It is easier to open the bottle by hand then to use this product. I am disappointed because I have a friend that has one and hers works good. I bought one for a father's day gift and now I can't give it to him because I'm afriad it won't work either. I am going to return them for my money back.
2,Good idea but poor quality,I returned the item the day it arrived. It's a great idea (thus the 2 stars) but the quality just isn't there. It took 5 tries on most bottles just to get it to work and the magnet isn't strong enough to hold bottle tops that have a paper wrapper. Maybe they'll improve the quality in a few years and I'll reconsider purchasing again.
2,Attack of the 12 pack,"Interesting little gem which actually worked for 11 times 'til I got to the end of a 12 pack of water my wife makes me drink. Then it kind' a sighed, gave a short springy gasp and died. After trying several attempts as resuscitation, I left its brushed aluminum body lay silently on the counter. I informed my well meaning spouse of the contraption's early demise and blamed it on the water."
1,Big Dissapointment...,"I bought this item after seeing it on Diggnation. Well not this exact one, but similar. I thought that since it was stainless steel it would be awesome and be made of better quality. I was wrong. These things easily break after mild usage. It is plastic insides with sub-par quality springs that wear out. The opener completely became ineffective after about a months use. Be gentle if you do buy this. The concept is there...the craftsmanship is not. Save your money and buy a cheap plastic one. When it comes down to it. They are one and the same. The only difference is the expensive outer shell. The innards are still made rather cheaply."
2,"Cheap plastic, there are better versions",I know someone who owns a similar device so I wanted to get one for my mother. This model is cheap and poorly designed. You could get it to open a bottle but usually not on the first try and it often mangled the bottle cap. I do NOT recommend this product. I am back on the search for the one my co worker owns which is made of metal and easily removes bottle caps.
1,"Great Concept, Poorly Executed","I've used these type devices many time before without a problem. However, this particular brand performed poorly. While removing green twist off caps it chipped 3 out of 4 bottle tops sending chards into the beverage. Seemed to work fine on brown non twist bottles until a spring fell out of the unit rendering it useless."
2,"Cool idea, but didn't hold up","After using this for 6 months plastic parts and a spring flew out of it one day when I was opening a bottle. Most commercially capped bottles required two presses to open, but I noticed that the bottles that I capped myself opened on the first try."
1,Piece of Junk,"We ordered this product because we were unable to get ""The World's Greatest Bottle Opener"" from another merchant, who was so backordered that we wouldn't be able to get it in time for a Christmas gift. The product looks exactly the same, but trust me it doesn't compare in terms of quality. We started using it as soon as we got it and noticed it took a couple of tries to get some caps off. Then, over the next few weeks, we noticed it got worse and finally this week a spring popped out of it and it no longer works at all. What a piece of junk. Don't waste your money, get the real thing (IF you can find it)."
2,"Exterior good, Interior not so good","Same problem as many others. Worked for a couple of months then the spring inside blew out. Now, it's decor` on top of my microwave. Very disappointed."
1,Broke the glass!,DO NOT BUY THIS! DANGEROUS!!It broke a chip off the top of the very first two bottles I tried to open and deposited the broken chip INSIDE the bottle and left a dangerously sharp edge on the rim of the bottle!!! Returning for full refund!
1,worst product ever. scam,"this bottle opener is so broke. $20 and it didnt even work. the springs inside the mechanism busted on its first use and once those went the whole thing was ruined. Do not buy this product, its cheap and mine didnt even work."
1,Breaks almost immediately,I've bought three of these bottle openers myself and have given one away as a gift. All are broken after only a few uses. Every one has the same problem. The little spring breaks and doesn't allow the mechanism inside to catch the edge of the bottle cap anymore. I bought the stainless steel version because I thought it would be more durable. It isn't. Very disappointed.
3,Need better Quality Control,Worked great - for about 3 beers. Returned for replacement. Now I am worried the replacement will break..When it was working - it worked very well...
1,Not What Expected,"I thought this would be a great addition to our local bar but I was wrong. I could tear a cap off with my teeth faster and better than this opener. It was very unreliable and wouldn't catch the cap everytime. And some bottles were like prying a weld off a post. And when that happens, you are stuck with an un-opened beer and the bottle opener stuck to the top until you finally get it off.A great novelty item that you could look at but not use. Don't show people you have one or you could embarass yourself trying to open a bottle."
2,Broke after 2 months,"I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. We saw a similar item at a friend's house & were intrigued. We purchased this one because the stainless steel finish looked upscale. Not more than 2 months later, the spring inside broke making it unusable."
1,Cheap - in price and design.,"I have installed 100's of towel bars and never seen one engineered to fail like this one. I have installed this thing three times today and it is JUNK! The styling is nice. I love it in fact, that is why I bought it. It was to replace a Kohler double towel bar. Well, there is about 1/16"" play where the bars enter the mount attached to the wall so they WILL fall out. Using the template and level each time it fails, not enough of the bar enters the mount. They should give a lifetime warranty... it will never be used because the thing won't ever work long enough to break! Save yourself the trouble, buy a different brand."
1,stressed out,"Looks really nice, but poorly engineered. A single set screw on each end of the bar is all that keeps everything together. Both screws stripped before I got it assembled the first time. Replaced w/locally purchased set screws, which tightened down ok, but will not hold well enough to support the stresses from 2 large towels."
2,"Great idea, but....",the second bar pops out all the time. It also comes loose from the wall and has to be adjusted often. I'm now looking for a replacement!
3,Thumb support is annoying,"The thumb support is very annoying, even after taking out the splints. Maybe it is because I have side buttons on my mouse. I had to cut it off after half an hour. Jury is still out on the rest of the glove."
3,Smart gllove with thumb support,"The product was what I ordered and it works fine. However, the packaging was inaccurate so I almost sent it back without opening it. There are a number of variations of this product, and I definitely wanted the thumb support feature which is not automatically a feature of all Imak smart gloves. The photo image on the package container clearly was not of the glove with the thumb support feature, thus my interpretation that it was not the right one. I would suggest that the effort be made to package items correctly so as to avoid this potential error."
5,Great for ARTHRITIS!,i HAVE ARTHRITIS IN THE THUMB JOINTS OF BOTH HANDS. I have found a lot of relief just sleeping with these on each night!
4,Light weight support,Good glove for light support. I was right on the size edge and its a little tight but I'd rather have it that way so its true to size.
2,uncomfortable,"I find this glove to be very weird and uncomfortable. It has a sort of cushion on the palm of the hand (near the wrist). It is supposed to make it more comfortable to use a mouse, but I think it makes it even more difficult.The other thing is, this thing is supposed to help support your thumb, but I found it uncomfortable. My thumb felt a lot better after I took off the glove.Maybe it's not a bad product, but it's definitely not for me."
3,Splints too soft.,"This glove may be ok for people with mild wrist discomfort, or those who spend thier time at a keyboard,.... but I found that for someone who uses a mouse most of the day... it's too flimsy. The splints are foam, and they bend way too easily. They do nothing to prevent my hand, wrist or thumb from going anywhere. So, depending on your needs, it's a good glove,... just not for my needs I guess."
3,Interesting product but didn't work for me,"The glove was of good quality and the shipping was fast. Although it was very reasonably priced it didn't work for me. First, I am usually a size M but the glove size was really big, I should have ordered an XS or S for it to give me some sort of support.It didn't really feel that different from an ergonomic mouse pad, which tends to be a bit more comfortable since after wearing it the entire work day your palm is really sweaty and the material starts smelling funny.I would recommend this product only for people with very mild wrist pain who only need a bit of support."
3,Hurts my thumb,"I love the thumbless version so I decided to try this one also. It really hurts my thumb after a while. It feels as if I'm not getting any blood. I consider my thumbs pretty thin, but apparently not thin enough!"
3,Informative,This DVD is very interactive and contains exciting behind the scene footage from actual missions. It was very interesting to watch and very informative.
4,A Family Saga,"Edna Ferber, a best selling author of her time, has written an ageless book depicting four generations of a Seattle frontier family. This is a novel that is rich with fascinating characters and vividly describes a slice of multi-generational American life in the northwest. The book begins when Seattle was first settled, and carries the reader through time to the Alaskan gold rush, ending at the time of World War II. She paints a well drawn picture of time and place, and follows the family as it grows wealthy yet ill at ease with itself. Ms. Ferber takes the reader on a journey to beautifully interesting times and places. Her characters are fully drawn and set against a vast landscape. The pages fly. If you enjoy reading Edna Ferber, you will enjoy Great Son."
4,Great newbie book... watch out for poor editing.,"With very little PHP experience, but a fair amount of other language experience (Java, VB, HTML), I learned a considerable amount of information from this book. I'm very glad I purchased it, although I wish the book had at least been read by someone before sending it to the press.Many of the typos were glaring. Like: a word was supposed to be dotted-underlined to signify a foreign key (p. 184), or a table was referred to, but no table existed (sorry, can't find the specific referrence, but I know it was there).Either way, if a second edition comes out with updates such as XML, WAP, etc. with some editing, buy it with confidence. Other than that, buy it with the understanding that problems exist but you will still definately benefit overall."
2,"Errors, Lack of References, and Occasionally Off-Topic","Besides several factual errors in description of functions in PHP, the most annoying thing about this book is how it drifts off-topic. Ecommerce, Website Usability, and topics covered more thoroughly in dozens of other books find their way into some chapters of this book.Perhaps because this book was written by two authors, instead of one, there is some inconsistency in use of language throughout the book. It could have used a good, thorough, professional edit for fluency before going to press.Also, in my opinion, the coding conventions as outlined in the book present a poor example for readers to follow.""Building Your Own Database-Driven Website Using PHP & MySQL"" by Kevin Yank retains its top spot in my library when it comes to these two technologies. Too bad that book is only available directly through it's publisher (try doing a Google search for it)."
4,Good but there are some errors,"This book is pretty easy to follow, but at times there were some syntax errors in the example code shown in the book and numerous grammatical mistakes. I just think more time should have been put into proofreading the code and grammar. Other than that I enjoyed the book."
2,Misleading examples and not enough explanation,I found this book to only touch upon important subjects of MySQL and PHP. If you want a better explanation of PHP and MySQL download the free online manual for each of these. The examples they give you are not detailed and can be misleading and have you scratching your head why they don't work.
3,"At times hard to follow, but a fine back-up reference","Not the best for the beginner. Personally I hate it when incredibly advanced programmers write books. They use abbreviations for variables that I found hard to follow, tons of 'include' files, which if you aren't familar with programming is excellent real world practice, but, not the best way to do things when you're trying to learn and understand the language, or an example. This book has been used as an alternative reference when an example in my other books isn't exactly clear, as another perspective. Cutting corners with abreviations and include files is fine when you're doing a project for a client and time is of the essence, but not when you're trying to explain concepts to the learning masses!"
4,Good Book,"This is a very good book and very helpful. I only have one disappointment about it. I found that it didn't walk you through making things from the ground up. Such an example is the Forum chapter. It takes an already made forum and talks about how it works. I personally enjoy working from scratch. Overall, though, this is a great book. It teaches PHP and MySql very very well!"
2,5 Stars No No!!!,"I did be better of reading the manual. I spotted several mistakes and several low grade examples which i thought were very decently covered in the manual.Over and above all this, the inconsistent code styles totally put me off.The only saving grace were the case studies.It was definitely not worth the money i spent."
2,Over-rated,"Even something like PHP Developer's Cookbook is much better. This uses three words for every one required, almost like it's trying to pad the book out to make it look as if it's worth more.The best choice is probably Programming PHP by Lerdorf and Tatroe - much more concise, and much more authoritative.I'm taking my copy of this book back for a refund!"
2,Not much help,"I spent a good SAM proverbial""21 days"" on digesting this monster book. But it has failed to impart anything beyond a beginning knowledge to help me build dynamic web-sites using PHP/MySQL.Disappointment."
2,Not Impressed,"I've been a programmer for a years. This book is geared towards a beginner. Not just at PHP or mySQL. A beginner. Period.If you know programming and wanted to bone up on PHP and mySQL, look elsewhere.I am.I wouldn't know how to rate a beginner book, so if you are a beginner, read the other reviews.As a beginner book, I guess it's ok. For veterans, it's not going to get you going fast in PHP.Your eyeballs will strain moving back and forth and your brain won't get fat with knowledge.I wish books were forced to be rated. Even a ratio of eyeball movement / information would be helpful.Next time, I'm going to go down (like drive) to a bookstore and check it out before I buy online."
5,Excellent for experienced webcoders,"Excellent coverage of ecommerce site building for anyone with some experience in html and preferably dynamic site building (not necessary) and sql. I am a professional JSP/Java coder and found this book to be very clear, precise and comprehensive. Highly recommended!"
5,"How to develop dynamic, secure e-commerce Web sites","PHP And MySQL Web Development teaches the reader to develop dynamic, secure e-commerce Web sites. The reader will learn to integrate and implement these technologies by following real-world examples and working sample projects. PHP And MySQL Web Development also covers related technologies needed to build a commercial Web site such as SSL, shopping carts, and payment systems. Intermediate - Advanced, 880pp."
4,Great book!,"I picked this book up as a total PHP beginner and was creating useful applications quickly. The examples are excellent and walk you through processes step by step. Now that I know more about PHP from different sources I can see that there are some gaps in information in this book, but I'd definitely recommend it to beginners. It helps if you've already done a little scripting.Just one thing: why is this edition more expensive than the new second edition???"
3,good book,"PHP and MySQL web development is a good book that covers many aspecs of PHP and MySQL in simple, easy to understand instructions. But the reality is, that PHP is a scripting laguage with limits, and ASP.NET is taking over!"
3,Not the best resource for non-programmers,"I purchased this book quite a while back and found it to be quite comprehensive but not particularly user-friendly, as someone with very little explicit programming training. Unfortunately I can't recommend any alternatives at the moment but if you are new to coding (particularly if you're coming from a background in the visual side of web design) this may not be the best book for you."
4,The correct track listing is....,"The track listing amazon has provided is incorrect.The following is the correct track listing:01 So, Side02 Beg, Steal Or Borrow03 Saddle Up04 Circlin'05 Do Me A Favor06 Suicide At The Wishing Well07 Adelaide08 Already Gone09 Train Wreck10 Dancin' On The Water11 Behind Me12 Right Through You13 Southside Of The Sky"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought two of these bowls for my Terrier's cage and I can't get over how cheaply made they are. I guess you get what you pay for. When I attempted to tighten the wing nut down it bent the piece of metal that clamps on the outside of the cage like it was paper. When I got home from work I found the bowl and ring on the floor and the dog had managed to swallow the wing nut. I think these bowls would work a lot better if the pieces that grip the cage had some sort of texture to allow them to grip the cage, instead it's just two smooth pieces of metal. If it's not tight enough the ring holding the bowl moves easily or comes off all together, and as stated before, if you tighten it too tight, it just bends and makes it less stable."
1,Vital Speeches of Last Year,"August 3, 2004Still nothing.Reflects poorly not only on the publisher but also on the website that offers the product.This ordering system is a technological masterpiece of the new millenium!Bravo, Jeff!"
3,Lacks something to be desired...,"I liked the idea of the customized flooring, but the description didn't tell me what it was made of. It is actually the cardboard box the display case comes in and it has to cut it out. This results in seeing the rough edges of the cardboard box. It looks like something a kid would have rather than to display a nice autographed ball in a sports room. I would not recommend this display of an autographed item that could prove to be worth something in the future.The ball also rolls around in the box. The box needs to be smaller and possibly they need to include a way to mount the ball into one place. I don't know what the other display cases offer, but I will definitely look into it."
5,Outstanding book for children of Army personnel!,An outstanding book for young children whose parents are in the Army. A book children will remember and keep for the rest of their lives. When they grow up it will really bring back the memories of their parents! I understand the authors may be writing books on parents of other branches of military service. Watch for them!
2,Not what it seems,"It is true that the shuttle does ride piggy back on this 747... as long as you either a: hold the plane completely flat, or b: use a rubber band to wrap arround the shuttle and 747 to keep them together.The pegs on the 747 that prop up the shuttle are extremely sharp once the shuttle is removed, which is always.The shuttle is metal where its white, and plastic where its black (including the nose). The tip of the nose snapped off forward of the insertion hole for the metal peg of the 747 after about a week of trying to rig this thing together with a rubber band. The band wasn't even put on there tightly, just enough to keep the pieces joined. So now the shuttle wont stay on at all because the peg has no where to grip into.Oh, well. That's only one dissapointed three year old, right?"
1,A great disappointment,"This book was written in 1981 and, unfortunately, it hasn't aged well. It is loaded with unfulfilled sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that look pretty silly in retrospect. I have great respect for Foster's other books, but this one is in desperate need of a rewrite -- with a lot less agitprop and a lot more spirituality."
4,Good book,Definitely a good book that produces a lot of good thought. I love the relevance of the subject to how we live.
5,The only book you need on simplicity,"Why did it take me so long to find this book? Kudos to Harper for reissuing it after years of being out of print. I have read a number of recent, popular books on ""voluntary simplicity"" and ""downshifting,"" but none approach the beauty of Foster's clear and compelling treatise on the ""complexity of simplicity."" After outlining the spiritual foundation of the notion of simplicity, he offers practical means of working to achieve it. If you're interested in ""living the simple life"" BUY this book and check all those other titles out of the library! A great book for ""downshifters"" regardless of their spiritual background."
1,Just spend the extra money and get a real diesel generator :(,It won't run or generate power. Manufacturer will not honor warranty because it was not purchased directly from them. Phone numbers and emails to All American Power (made in china) are never responded to. Run far away from this generator. Thank to Amazon for standing by their customers. I got a full refund.
4,Wonderful book for women of all ages!,"Fantastical Tales for the Heroine's Quest takes its reader on a magical journey with three amazing women. The heroines of this book encounter mystical creatures, experience betrayal, heartbreak and physical challenges on their journey to what ultimately is the realization of their own power. The message of female strength and sisterhood is inspirational for women of any age. The poetry and lyrical prose in this book make it a captivating read. I could not put it down!"
3,For him a disappointment,"I think Steve Earle is great and his last few albums prompted me to run and get some more early ones, but this is a disappointment. For quite a few of the songs I thought of another song he'd done that was better. Most of the songs lack the urgency of his recent work."
4,"Happy to have this one, too...","As a HUGE Steve Earle fan (of his work...I myself am very average-sized!), I really like this one. I wouldn't say it's one of the best because many of the songs sound like others he's done on other albums. That said, though, this is worth buying and turning up loud on one of those sunny afternoons...have a beer or a glass of wine and listen to Steve. It really doesn't get any better than that!"
4,This is a catchy album.,"There are a lot of good tunes on this album. I think that ""Ellis Unit One"" is a classic. ""Creepy Jackelope Eye"" just keeps growing on me, and ""My Uncle"" is a well done protest song with a sense of humor. The chorus on ""Willin' just keeps coming back to me. There is a little bit of a lot of different things to like on this album. I think that I like this album most because almost all the songs are quality songs that are well done, and STeve Earle's versions are pretty good renditions of some great songs."
5,Wonderful essays finally available,It is hard to find the scarce published of Campbell's essays and this book delivers. These selections are full of Campbell's brilliance but leave you wanting more. It is a good thing it is only PART of his collected works! There is more to come!
5,JOSEPH CAMPBELL,I am a professional storyteller. This work as well as many of his other books speaks to me on a personal as well as a deeply spiritual level.
3,Aviation Whether,"The book is knowledgable and easy to understand , but the printing quality of the book is not upto the mark . If the print quality is good and attractive the reader will enjoy more. Thanks."
3,just the basics in this book,"What you really need to read is AVIATION WEATHER SERVICES Advisory Circular, AC 00-45F, Revision 1. THe Aviation Weather book covers the basics but what you need to read is AC 00-45F to understand how to obtain and use weather info."
4,Aviation Weather,This is an essential publication for all general aviation pilots. A concise and well written summary of aviation weather in one volume.
4,Aviation Weather,This book is interesting for not only someone interested in aviation but those who spend a lot of time outdoors.
2,OLD SCHOOL,"Probably a good book 50 years ago; from the contents point of view it's a very standard book but the form is unacceptable. It looks like it has been printed 80 years ago. Most of the drawing and pictures are unreadable due to the extremely poor press quality. The cover page is very representative of the content. One of the ugliest book I ever seen in my Instructor and Pilot career. Save your money, there are a lot of much nicer books on the market."
4,Fun and Instruction,"The DVD contains two sections. One of them is mainly tricks and fun, while the other (IQ) really shows you how to do things with your windsurf. In this part they show you step by step the different maneuvers using three or more cammeras at the same time. I missed the waterstart though."
2,Not an instructional dvd,"This dvd has pretty nice footage of professional windsurfers, but by no means an instructional video I thought it is judging by the title."
2,Not that great of a pool,"The picture makes it look alot bigger and fun than it is. The slides tip over when the kids are on it, they cannon slide down feet first or they will tip over. It'd be a fine wading pool, but the slides take most of the room and the price really makes it stink. Also, there are like 14 different sections to put air in, making it cumbersome to fill and put away to store. overall, a 10 dollar wading pull would be more fun for the kids. The slides are a joke."
2,Not practically fun,"My kids talked me into this pool. The slides are more dangerous than fun and require constant adult intervention. Kids will quickly want to go head first and will hit their heads on the bottom on such a shallow pool. Even when you tie the slides down they fall over, even with toddler sized kids climbing on them. The drain valve ripped off on our second day of use. It's a great deal smaller than in the picture . . dimensions stated related to the slides, not to the pools. Any two foot deep inflatable pool is way better, especially if the bottom inflates for cushioning."
1,I was lied too.,This pool is a rediculous example of false advertising. Looking at the tale or stairs into the pool you will note triangles that indicate the number of steps. In reality their is one step. The child sliding out of the pool appears to have perhaps 2 or 3 feet to descend this is not so. My five year old can sit at the top of the slide and have about 6 inchesbefor her feet touch the ground. The feet appear to be pillow size. They are in fact no larger than a football. The two children in the pool would be touching knees in reality. The box tells you that you cannot return this product to the store. Tonight I will call the company and demand either the pool I bought or a full refund.
3,GET A KICKER INSTEAD,I went through 2 of these in 2 years due to the glue used to connect the surround to the cone giving way. kickers have sewn on surrounds and are far more durable. I was pushing this with the infinity ref 900A amp.
3,It's a pamphlet,"It's a 32 page pamphlet giving a general overview. Half the pages are on growing, the other half on uses with simple recipes. It has some use as a cross reference against other, more in depth sources. As a grower I found it on the wanting side."
4,Have all the greats in one book...,A huge effort was done here to fulfill the great concept of teaming up superheroes...the introduction & end notes are also great...as you go on the story telling improves & you have a nice treat whoever you're favourite hero is.Classic stories like the Flash of two earths & crisis on earth one are great to have...the green arrow/green lantern pairing is great... the batman/creeper story is dark but with a lame villain...the superman/swamp thing story is classic...In short you get to know all the DC heroes & you see them interacting nicely...Two thumbs up!
3,Not my favorite,I just got this album and its just a little too country for me. I really like all of Kenny's newer cds. But this one is going to take some time for me to get used to it. I like the Tin Man.
2,Not for AP parents,"There was some helpful, interesting advice in this book, but so much of it went against my basic instict and attachment parenting style. For example, he tells mothers that they need to get out of the house and leave the baby with a sitter in the first 10 days. It's important, he says, that the baby learn that mom won't always be there. A baby needs to learn that at 10 days!? Shouldn't they learn at that point that mom WILL be there, so they feel secure and loved? He also calls babies hedonistic manipulators, saying if you pick them up whenever they fuss, they'll just learn to fuss. I believe in listening to the baby's cries and realizing they cry for a reason. Infants don't have the ability to manipulate. I didn't finish the book because after these tidbits, I didn't trust any other advice he had to offer. Glad I got it from the library."
1,"Warning: Never read a ""first time moms"" book written by a man..","I should have known not to read a book about First Time Moms written by a man - psychologist or not. He has a very strong viewpoint on moms not working Full Time outside of the home. If you are a mom who chooses to do so, reading this book(and that chapter in particular) may cause you to feel like you aren't making enough 'sacrifices' as he puts it, for your child. He is very anti-daycare and seems to lump all daycares into one group. I really, really disliked this book. Save yourself the time and read the Girlfriend's Guide instead of this man's old fashioned viewpoints that just don't work with today's families. Being a good parent is more than being home during the day to ""make lunches for your child"" or 'bandage their knee"" in my opinion..."
4,"Great book, but just like with any parenting book, follow your instincts too","I think my title for this review pretty much sums it up. I may not agree with every single thing in this book, but after reading lots and lots and lots of parenting and child care books out there, I've learned that there are some things we have to decide on our own as parents. I think that the books make great guides, and this guide is a good one in particular. I read the author's Birth Order Book right after this and would recommend that as well."
2,"""Hands on"" - yes, ""Engineering"" - questionable","I ma an engineer, and have read a good number of books on racing and engineering, and looked forward to receiving this book. However, when I began flicking through it, it seemed more of a handbook on assembling an open wheel race car.If you happen to be building an open wheel race car, then this is the book for you. If you are more interested in overall racing engineering, then I feel it isn't. The level of detail seemed excessive and specific. There are chapters on choosing a trailer, and tow vehicle. Useful, but not my cup of tea."
2,Don't expect the device to last too long,"I have been through a couple of these devices now. When brand new, they seem to do the job, but after a few months they just seem to give up. Even with a fresh battery, it seems like the motion sensor stops functioning. And I live in a very mild climate with little rain, so I can't blame the weather. In general, the CatStop feels light and flimsy for the price, rather than a solid piece of engineering. So if you decide to use this approach to keep cats off your lawn, budget on replacing at least twice a year - plus a string of replacement 9v batteries."
4,Love it!,"The neighborhood cats (6+) decided that my landscaping was a great place for their toilet. I was fed up with scooping poop, the smell and flies. Yuck! CatStop is great! It's not perfect - I wish the range was a little wider, but it works. I purchased 2 units, one for the front bed and one for the back yard. The unit in back seemed to get stuck in the on position, so the battery died quickly, however the battery was replaced and it is working fine. The cats that liked the back yard seem to have found another yard to make their deposits. So I moved the 2nd unit to the front (larger) bed to cover that area better. So far so good!"
2,"Sadly, not effective","I put one of these in one of my flower beds and for awhile, I thought it was working. But now I see the cats are up to their usual. It appears, the cooler weather reduced the stench. Unfortunately, I can't use the Scarecrow units in this location so my last hope is to put in those plants that supposedly, cats don't like.Two stars because it may have reduced the amount I get each night. Please, someone invent something that makes cats leave their mountains all over their owner's property."
3,Works OK,"It isn't great, but it seems to have helped a bit. What I have noticed, is that when I see stray cats walking across my lawn, they walk pretty slow so they don't seem to trigger it as much as it triggers when I simply walk in front of it myself. BUT: there is less cat poop in my yard, and I see the cats a bit less."
1,Piece of junk - fills up with water,When they are brand new they seem to work. I have 5 cat stops. They all fill up with water when it rains. I have duct taped the battery compartment and they still fill up with water and short out and corode the battery.THIS IS NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT
1,Just don't do it,"I have two cats. I have been trying to keep a neighbor cat out of my yard--the little trouble maker. I purchased this and installed it in the usual passage. 10 minutes later--the cat is in my backyard fighting with one of mine. So much for that.Then, I decided to try it on my own cats and see if they flinched or 'anything'. Set it off--pointed right at them. True their ears did perk a bit---but no running away or look of anguish--nothing. Just--oh, dad's got a new squeaky toy.Useless."
2,Questionable effectiveness,"My dear old neighbor began feeding the neighborhood's feral cats a few years ago and since then, sloppy stinky little kitty poo piles are occasionally left on my lawn for me and my dog to step on. On the plus side, she, her husband and vet daughter trap the cats, get them fixed and dewormed. In some cases, they get new homes. In others, they're released to the suburban wild.With high hopes, I placed this device facing an 8 foot wide corridor where I often see cats crossing my lawn. It trips when my 50 lb dog or I walk past. Last night I watched a cat slink past about 6 feet in front and, to my disbelief, it didn't go off! I adjusted the aim of the motion sensor to better cover the lower airspace that felines occupy and will keep an eye on it. If it doesn't work, I will have to set up a network of the scarecrow water sprayers along known yard-turned-litter spots instead."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I have had cats pooping in my front garden for awhile, so I was excited when I received my Contech Catstop and put it outside, and for the first two days there was no cat poop! I thought my problems were solved. That was until I came outside on day three to see a huge mound within three feet of the Catstop. After that, the cats would poop right next to it, in front of it, behind it, they had absolutely no respect for it at all. Also, the thing eats up batteries like crazy. Don't bother wasting your time or money. Although the vendor was very receptive, it just is not worth it."
2,"Great idea, but didn't work","I bought two of these, hoping to keep the cats out of my yard. Unfortunately, the didn't work. The sensor on one was set off only if you walked directly in front of it from one ange, so the cats were easily able to avoid it, and the other one didn't work. Other reviewers have said that the company is agreeable about exchanging, though."
4,Works well!,"We had purchased one of these last year and it worked so well we bought two more for different areas of our property. (The cats around here learned quickly. After experiencing the first deterrent, they just moved on to other areas of our property to ""bless."") The only problem we've experienced is with the adapter, which has a tendency to fall out of the CatStop. This is because it attaches underneath the CatStop and gravity causes it to easily drop out. We would suggest a change to the way the CatStop is made so that the adapter goes in either the top or the side. Our ""fix"" was to wrap metal wire around the two pieces to hold them together."
1,Does not work,"There was a fresh load of cat poop deposited directly in front of the unit on the morning after the first night the unit was activated. I pictured the cat mewing ""neener neener neener"" as he did the deed. Perhaps it was one of those ""old and deaf"" cats that the small print says is not influenced by the ultrasonic blast. Bottom line: save your money, it doesn't work."
1,This Product did NOT work for me!,"Based on word of mouth and online shopping descriptions of this product, a co-worker of mine bought one (not through Amazon) to stop cats from doing their business in his lawn and garden, which is also my problem for the last 2 years with neighborhood stray cats.The unit did NOT work in preventing cats doing their business in my co-worker's lawn and garden. The product description states a 20-feet range, which really won't cover much of your standard lawn unless you buy 4+ of these.He let me try the unit, and it also did NOT work for me. I was planning to buy 3 through Amazon, but I am glad I did not.We strongly do NOT recommend this product."
1,Wrong Item shipped,"I hate sending things back. I recieved a ""Bark free,"" not a ""cat stop."" Oh well. How many of us have not messed up?"
1,Cat Stop,This is junk. It does not in anyway detect any movement beyond 4 feet. A waist of money. Buy a gun instead. A true cat deterrent.Lame!
1,Works for a short while then cats dont care!,"I bought two of these. The cats were using my raised garden boxes as litter boxes made just for them! So, my wife got an idea and bought them. Waste of money. They dont care once they get used to them! Best thing to do is put up the plastic fabric fencing around your garden. Btw the battery does'nt last long either. Also anything like dirt or rain affects they units and renders them useless and inoperative unless checked and cleaned often. Ultrasonic gimmick, save money buy some 4 foot plastic fencing and put it up instead.Ultrasonic Motion Sensing Animal Repeller - 300000045"
3,the item cannot be used,I bought the contech catstop ultrasonic outdoor cat deterrent. To my dissapointment in total I bought 2 boxes of the above. I realised 1 of them are not fixed with any battery wire inside. So now is redundant. Can someone revert back to me on this?
3,cat stop,"The cat stop seems to work fairly well although it is not possible to see what happens at night. However, no cat poop has been seen on my lawn since installing the CATSTOP."
2,"Give it a try, it may work for you, but my cat just ignore it.","Its sensor is very sensitive. You can place it in your walkway, kitchen, or bedroom. The stick below the deive can be removed. People cannot hear its ultrasound. So, do not worry it will wake you up in the night.I like this device, but, it does not work on my kitten. My kitten can stand about 1"" in fornt the ""cat stop"" after it is activated. My kitten just IGNORE it. It may work on other cat, but not on my cat. Too bad!According to its reviews, it works on about 50% of cats. Give it a try, it is a very good produce if it works for you. Good luck!"
1,Do not buy this product,I purchased this product to keep several cats out of my flower bed. It doesn't work. All of the cats are still using my flower bed for their bathroom. I am left to scare them away when I am at home. I have noticed all of the same cats using my flower bed and I have moved the device to different places in the flower bed without any effect on the cats.
1,"Good shipment, Worthless product","The CatStop came quickly and in good condition. It was easy to set up.However, it was more effective as entertainment than a deterrent for the neighbor cats. At first they learned to just stay just at the edge of its range so as not to trigger it. Then they must have gotten used to it because they learned to sit right in front of it, under the bird feeders, etc. Totally worthless."
4,Thank You!,"It worked! Prior to buying the Ultrasonic outdoor Cat deterrent, three cats were using my backyard as a toilet. But for the past four weeks I haven't seen any cats or their poop in my yard.I heard one in my neighbor's yard out of the range of the cat deterrent. So, I'm going to get another one."
1,doesn't work,Set it up in my kids' sandbox last night. This morning there was a great big cat poop buried in the sand right in front of it. Perhaps I should have invested in a .22 caliber rifle instead.
4,"Yes, it works but not perfect.","It works, but cats are trying to find the other spots. But my success criteria is to defend my raised vegetable bed. In this point of view, it works.I would suggest you to keep moving this location when you find their unwanted object."
4,I love it!,"I had an active birdfeeder in my back yard until a new neighbor moved next door with a cat. I like cats, but this cat was spending more time in my yard than in its own. I bought the CatStop to discourage the cat from coming over and scaring away the birds. The cat still comes around, but not nearly as often and doesn't just hang out any more. Now it runs through my yard or skirts around it. Best news is the birds are coming back too! If the CatStop was cheaper, I'd buy a couple more, but for now I can only afford the one."
1,Waste of money,Doesn't work. Bought it to keep cats off my car. Installed it right at hood level. Doesn't even faze the cats. They'll walk right up to it when it's on. I even have it plugged in to AC so there's no issue with battery life. Maybe it works for others but not for us.
1,Cats are coming back after one month,"I am having the problem with my neighbor cats, I bought one unit and tried out, I saw the cat walk away when she came very close to the unit, then I decided to bought one more after a week I tried my first unit but it too bad, after a month, the cat clean herself right in front of the unit, then I thought the unit ran out of battery even I hear the sound when I walk by the unit and replaced with the new one but too bad, same thing happen."
3,Unsure but optimistic,"I bought one these to keep neighborhood strays (which get feed from next door) off my lawn.When I first put it out, it seemed to work. However the cats figured one of two things: #1- They figured out its just a noise and not going to hurt them. #2- They found the range limits of the unit and get onto my lawn from a different angle.Some times when I walk in front of it, it does not go off. I don't think there is a motion sensitivity knob with the unit either. I have not confirmed this either way yet.My next test is to either buy another unit OR move this one from its current location to where these cats now gather.So while I am unsure if this is working 100% of the time, I am optimistic that it is working as stated. To its credit, no cats have come onto my lawn where the unit is located"
1,stop working after 1 year,i bought this unit in 2007. it stop working in 2008. it seem to work for the most part. but i give it 1 star because it is so unreliable.i paid $60 for this unit in 2007.
1,I'm disappointed,"I purchased this product with an expectation that it would stop all the cats from coming to my backyard killing the birds. The night was on whenever it sensed the motion. I believed the unit was working properly. However, the cats just simply ignored it. They even sat in front of the unit. No impact on the cats at all."
1,Cat Stop,It hasn't worked for us. We got it to keep the neighbors cat out of the kids sandpile.But the cat walks right in front of it to get to his favorite spot in the sandpile. We were disappointed that it didn't work.
4,Finally an Answer to our cat problem,"Our problem was a neighborhood cat was doing it's night time hunting and catching rats, enjoying about half of them and leaving the remains at our front doorstep mat which we would discover in the mornings. Very disgusting to us. Our front courtyard is walled (5-6""), but that didn't stop the delivery of about 5-6 remains over a 3-4 week period. I tried initially with a motion activated light sensor, which seemed to work for about a week, but then new corpses were found. The Cat Stop I purchased 3 weeks ago has worked perfectly so far. I will be happiest after about 2 months of success to be certain our feline friend has found a new doorstep to place his trophies."
1,Waste of money; I'm returning CatStop,"Zero stars! Five stars for the thumbs-down icon. Like so many other review writers (suckers for good copy like me)...the CatStop didn't stop the ferel cats that use my property as their grand toilette! A FOR SALE sign wouldn't cost $50... What's amazing: that it works wonderfully for some and NOT AT ALL for others. The bother of returning it just saps a little more energy in addition to picking up mounds of fly-laden cat poop all summer. The New Jersey cats don't ""cover up."" Stray cat feeders should be FINED... there OUGHTA BE A LAW. It's as much a health hazard as smoking but it's okay? What the heck!"
1,Does not work,Unfortunately this product does not work. I have tried it in numerous locations and the cat(s) just blatantly ignore it. I am very disappointed in this product.
1,Did not work at all....,"Sorry to say, this was a total waste of money. For a couple weeks we discovered the range is only less than feet and you had to be tall or a person to set this off. The cats walk right by one foot away, once in awhile it will click and a light will go off (suppose tohave a high pitch sound that will scare cats, don't know) However, the cat looks at it for a second and continues on."
4,Best little cat deterrent around!,"Since installing this product I have not seen a cat in my yard. I am a wildlife carer and rehabilitator specialising in birds and had always been fearful of my neighbours cats stressing out my ""patients"" even though they are caged. Hopefully those days are gone!"
1,This doesn't work don't waste your money,This product doesn't work don't buy it! if you have bought it make sure that you return it before 30 days otherwise the company won't issue you a refund and your stuck with a cat deterrent that isn't worth a crap.
3,working well but not robust,working well and very effective but weak in hot sun and a sensor out of order among three
1,Doesn't work at all,"These only effectively works once or twice on a cat, then the cat isn't phased by it. Also the effective range is about 5 feet. Not a product worth getting."
2,Didn't work,"Sorry to say it didn't work!The setting is only one frequency.My cats walked right in front of it with no effect. Only one of my cats responded and it was because she was younger, and I assume, had better hearing.On the other hand the ""The Garden Creations JB5028 Ultrasonic Cordless Pest Repeller"", worked very well and had a number of frequencies to pick from. If one freq didn't work, I was able to pick another until it did work."
5,Stops the stray cat garden strut,"The neighborhood stray cats like to strut through my yard and stop off at my garden to relieve themselves, which is annoying and disgusting in the flower bed and beyond disgusting in the vegetable garden. This product received good reviews, but I was skeptical of the price. When I started having visions of myself with night vision goggles and a pellet gun, lying in wait for the cats, I decided it was time to try this out. I have a cat myself, so once I received the product and put in the 9-volt battery, I decided to do some experimentin'. Kitty wasn't pleased. It took about 10 seconds of confused looks at the contraption before she backed away and scurried off. I set it up in the garden and haven't had my garden used as a litter box since. One thing you do have to keep on top of is battery life. It's motion sensitive, so as the wind blows the taller plants in the garden it sets off."
1,Deffinetly not as advertised.,"We have a problem with stray cats. We set up 2 CatStops at each main entry the cats use to get in our yard. They have not worked at all, the cats have actually started peeing on the unit. They need new batteries about once per week. Deffinetly a waste of money."
1,My cats favorite toy!!! Don't BUY!!!,She loves when the red light goes off. As soon as it turns on she runs right to it to give it a big hug. Great toy for cats but does not work.
3,Don't get too excited:(,"The pet deterrent worked for about 1 week, but then our pets got used to it. They are back to there old ways. I am a little disappointed."
2,Works for awhile,"The CatStop worked for about two weeks in my plant bedding area. I watched as the cat would enter the area, hear the noise, and would dart out. I thought ""yeah, it works!"", but in the last two weeks I've found numerous kitty droppings. Apparently the cat figured out that while the noise was startling, it wasn't going to hurt him, and now he's back to his old behavior."
4,lookin for the 9 voit hookup.,"hey this thing does work, so well in fact go through 9 voits like water, we tried ever 9 voilt hook up we had, none fit, so make my day, just point in right direction, thanks very much."
4,Worked for me!,"I had neighborhood cats peeing on my porch furniture every day. Since I started using CatStop, that has ENDED. They don't venture on my porch anymore."
1,Does NOT Work!,"Don't bother with this product...it DOES NOT WORK!!!I bought this product after trying other cat repellents, with no luck either. All of the neiborhood cats like to use the flowerbed under my open bedroom window as a litterbox. Peeww! I placed this unit under the window and the cats still kept coming and doing their business right in front of it! I thought that maybe the bettary was not holding up, so I attached a 9 volt DC power cord as instructed, and still no success. I would not recommend this product. I am returning it for a refund, as it has a 30 day money back guarantee. I am crossing my fingers that they make good on it."
3,No OFF Swith,"I like the design. I like the fact that it's waterproof. But unfortunately, there is no off switch. Some of the others have that and I like the choice so that I can save battery life and also, not have to have it go off all the time when I'm in the immediate area (which is everyday). So I'm returning it."
1,Waste of money,"I thought this product would solve my problem with the cats in my garden. Of course not, it's like a toy to the cats they play around it. I was a waste of money and I plan to return it to Amazon. I am glad I saved the box!!!!"
1,unsatisfactory,It didn't work at any circumstance. Cats come and play in my yard. I have tried at different locations and angles.No indications that these change work either.
4,Efectivo desde el primer dia,"Recien sacado de la caja lo puse a funcionar y con esto se terminaron las desagradables peleas de gatos en mi techo en horas de la madrugada, el marcaje con orina y heces en mi jardin y las laminas transparentes quebradas de mi vivero. Lo unico que me costo conseguir fue la bateria de 9 voltios que ya no es tan comun en mi pais. Consegui un par de recagables de cadmio y opera sin problemas.La tranquilidad volvio y los gatos migraron a otras casas a hacer de las suyas. Bendita tecnologia."
1,Had to return,"This product was working Ok for a couple of days. It made stay away from my backyard some cats not all. After that it started making a noise when activated didn't bothered the cats at all. They just walked, relaxed and slept in front of it. That sounds funny but not for me. I had to return the item and Amazon gave me a full refund."
3,Doesn't quite stop the cat!,"It seems that maybe this product would work, but one day a cat was in my neighbor's yard near the cat stop and the cat only looked up briefly at the cat stop then went back to sleep. This was not the kind of cat that is described on the instructions that are not affected by the sound that the cat stop makes.Try this product at your own risk!"
1,Contech CatStop Ultrasonic Does Not Work,I purchased these devices because my 8 year old cat gets very agitated when she sees the feral cats and attacks our kittens. My cats are indoor cats.I purchased two Contech CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent devices. I installed them both in an area where feral cats come through my yard between my house and my neighbors. The instructions indicate it should activate when a cat gets withing about 20 feet. When it does a light will come on indicating it is working. On one the light never came on even when I walked with in two feet of it. On the other the light came on only when I got within about 4 to 5 feet of it. I watched the feral cats walk right past the one with the working light and they did not even notice it. I know the cats are not deaf because they will run when they hear me open my patio door.I sent them back for a refund and purchased the device that connects to a garden hose and uses a sprinkler and motion detector. That has worked.
1,Useless,"I bought this item a little more than a month ago, and I can truly say, is USELESS, the neighbor's cat just pass by like nothing is there.What I've notice is that the flies lie around it, so it's a VERY expensive Fly killer at the most, even the noise it makes when I pass by is annoying."
1,Didn't work a bit,"I bought this item because we have FOUR ""outdoor"" cats in our neighborhood.. They walk into our house and garage if the door is left open for just a minute... TWICE one of them spent the night in the garage leaving us ""presents""I bought this PRAYING that it would discourage them from ""visiting"" but they walked RIGHT in front of this and it had no effect..I sent it back..Good customer service received quickly and refunded quickly."
1,Cat stop - useless piece of equipment,"It didn't work at all , cats are still are pests in the garden, I want my money back !!"
4,Contech CatStop Cat Deterrent,This product seems to work pretty well. I don't think it has the range advertised and it need to be repositioned frequently. It has held up well in the deluge of rain we have had. It might work better with two or more of them covering the small yard we have.
1,Not work for all animals,"I brought two units, I found it doesn't work for turkey, I checked with seller, seller said it designed for cats. I'm going to return them. I also found the 9v bettary doesn't last 9 months, only couple of weeks."
2,Battery Sucker,The unit ran down the batteries in about 10 days. Location was such that we could not use the cord. Don't know if motion sensor is too senstive or what. It was located in front flower bed and maybe sprinklers kept setting it off--we don't know. We returned it.
2,does not work on all cats,"A neighborhood cat likes to make deposits in our backyard. I bought this unit to try to scare the cat away. Unfortunately this does not scare the cat in question. Reviewing the fine print, they note it does not work on all breeds of cats."
1,Because you can't leave zero stars,"I took a chance, the reviews were about 50/50. I could have bought 40 lottery tickets... Long story short, the cat poop in my back yard (around my kids swing set/playhouse, that is surrounded by mulch), is DIRECTLY in front of the device. You can see the red light activate, you can hear a faint ""click"" before the supposed ultrasonic tone, and it did absolutely NOTHING to scare away the neighbors roaming felines. Oh, and by the way, the cat was so unperturbed, that it took the time to BURY it's cr#p!Don't bother. Adopt a dog."
2,Stopped working after 1 month and the cats are laughing,and pooping in my mulch. The only solution is a rock garden.
5,Got my neighbor's cat out of my flower beds,"This product is great! I had tried EVERYTHING to get the neighbor's cat from ""doing his business"" in my flower beds (black pepper, red pepper, deterrants from the pet store, etc.). Some of these products would work for a day or two, but then the cat would resume his ""business"". I was skeptical at first, but gave it a try (since CatStop had a return policy). Oh my gosh...the cat has not touched my flower beds since! It really does work!"
1,CatDoesntStop,I bought this since I had trouble w/ my neighbor's cats and stray cats deficating in my back yard. I set it up per instructions and put it in my yard and I watched a cat jump into my yard and walk right up to it. It didn't scare the cat away even though it claims that it would.
4,Works pretty well ... except,I have three cats and bought this to keep one of them away from my door. It works very well on two of them but the one I wanted to deter is a Siamese. If you read the fine print it does state it might not work on some exotics. It also won't work if your cat has hearing problems. For all others it is great!
1,Useless,This item did not affect the cats' behaviour in any way. My front yard continued to be the local litter box for several cats. They even did their business directly in front of the device (within inches). The only thing the device did was turn on a red light when the cats approached the area.
1,NOT WORTH A DIME!,"I purchased this product to keep stray cats out of my yard. It maybe worked for one week, then the motion sensor stopped working. Not sure if it ever actually worked. Only way to get motion sensor to work is take out batteries and put back in recycle power) and then it only works one time. DON't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
1,Cat Repellent,"Cat stop does not work, just saw a cat stroll by stop and look up at the device and just continue on its way as if nothing happened, light worked, checked battery was fine ,if not a little rusty device obviously not water proof, 50 bucks what a waste of money :("
2,Does NOT work,"I purchased two of these CatStop Ultrasonic Cat Deterrents to stop the neighbors cat from dumping on my lawn. This product does not work. I still have ""gifts"" all through my lawn. What a waste of money. I see the sensor light go on but does nothing to DETER the cats."
1,GARBAGE,"This Cat deterrent is an absolute joke. First of all, when a cat walks in front, it sometimes works and sometimes does not work. And ALL cats walk in front of it and it has absolutely no affect. I have never been more disappointed in a purchased product. Maybe the manufacturer can refund my money... If so, please email me."
4,They hate it,"My barn cats used to jump on vehicles. I ""planted"" the catstop in a small clay pot and move it around to various strategic locations near where a car or truck is parked. Since I've started doing this I have had no cats jumping up, and they just may be deciding to forgo vehicles all together as they aren't jumping on ones that are not ""staked out"" with the Catstop also, but I'm only a couple weeks into this purchase. I've ""tested""it on them a few times and they really don't appreciate the sound- like it is the devils voice to them. The horse hears it but does not flee. I'll probably want a ac/dc converter soon as I'm sceptical about battery life. I'm buying another soon so I can stop playing musical deterrent also LOL"
3,Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent,I haven't had them long enough to determine if it is effective. After setting them I crawled on the grass to ascertain how far away the sensor was triggered. It was far less than the 20 feet maximum stated in the product description.
4,Great,"Great product. Installed it on an outside wall near a patio door, the one a cat used to scratch. After finding the right hight, it worked perfectly. Haven't seen the cat in a long time. Too bad this product does not come with an adaptor to plug it in."
2,"Cat Stop makes cats ""right at home"" in my yard!","This product makes clicking noises when anyone walks in the yard so I know it's doing something. I, however, constantly find a cat lying in my back yard sleeping!!! This product doesn't work at keeping cats out of my yard, soooooo frustrating."
1,Piece of junk,"Do NOT buy this product!Beside my own experience with CatStop, I have talked to two exterminators that told me these just don't work.I sent the following to the seller on August 2nd and have heard NOTHING from them.""As far as I am concerned, this is one of the biggest pieces of junk on the market.Battery lasts only a few days not months as advertised-It doesn't deter cats from doing anything-I've watched this is action a couple of times in the early morning light. The glowing red light went on when the cat entered my yard, it walked within five or six feet of CatStop, scratched around in the dirt a couple of times before defecating right in front of it, and walked on. And this was NOT an old, deaf cat because it sure heard me when I tapped on the window.I want to return this for a refund.What is the return policy? I am VERY unhappy with this product!""I am contacting Amazon next and hope they will help as the seller doesn't seem to care that they a peddling a sham."
5,Effective,"We have had quite a few cats come into our yard, with one cat in particular who kept urinating in our garage and spraying on our doors. This device has kept all the neighborhood cats away from our yard. We have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has done a great job. When I installed the battery, our own 2 cats went running to the other side of the house to get as far away from this thing as possible. I imagine that if you have a large area you are trying to protect that you would need more than one of these devices but this works well for us as we have a small yard."
3,CatStop CAT002 Ultrasonic Cat Deterrent,"It seemed to work at first, then the cats were back on the car. Will try positioning differently and see if it helps. If it doesn't, will return for a refund."
1,My cats love it.,"As soon as it goes off my cats run to it. They just love this thing. One of my cats likes it better then any of her other toys. She will huge it and play with it for hours, but she does not run from it you have to pull her off it."
1,Doesn't repel cats for long,"I bought this unit to keep a neighbor's cat from pooping in my kids' sandbox. It may have worked for a little while, but then the battery died after about two weeks (a single 9-volt doesn't seem to have the energy to power this for very long if there is much activity in you backyard), and the cat came back. I replaced the battery with a home-made 9-V replacement consisting of 6 1.5-V AA cells in a PVC pipe with a 9-V compatable connector, and now it seems to have lots of juice, but apparently the unit lost its scare factor when the original battery went bad and I have now found fresh poop in the sand about 2 feet in front of the fully functional unit. As a result, I cannot recommend this unit."
3,Still monitoring,"Have mixed results. Positioning tricky,tree leaves set it off. Mostly positive results, cats are not sitting on the fence tormenting the dog."
1,Contech CatStop,This product did not work for me. There was more cat feces around the area of the CatStop than prior to my using it.
1,"Don' t waiste your money, doesn't work and battery destroyer.","This unit doesn't stop the cats at all, it consumed 2 batteries within a month in slow traffic area. Cats are even cruising in fron of sensor and litter couple inches next to it. Amazon shoud take this unit off from their website, totally dissapointed."
2,Doesn't work for me and sucks batteries at the same time,"I've used this alarm for a year and a half. My original intent was to keep our two cats out of my vegetable garden. It seemed to work for the first few weeks. Either the device stopped working after that or the cats became immune to the sound because they continuted to frequent the garden. I've tried repositioning the device, I've tried numerous battery changes and nothing. Maybe some cats are immune. I've walked up to my lounging cat with the device and set it off. I THINK I see his ear twitch, but that's it. I knew the reviews were hit or miss when I ordered this but I was so desparate to keep them away that I thought I would try it. I am off to purchase theContech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinklernow to see if that works better. I advice you to save your money or your spouse will also be telling YOU ""I told you so."""
1,Just dosn't work.,"I purchased because of the reviews. Obviously they were not accurate. I have dozens of cats in my yard at night. Nothing has changed. I relocted it in different spots, high and low. I've changed batteries 3 times in less than a month. 9v and Its getting expensive for a item that has no effect. One star because the dogs next door seem to be barking less on my side of the fence. I wished I could get a refund but like a dummy I didn't keep the box or packing slip. I should of bought the $29 from TV and tried it 1st.TruelyDisappointed."
2,ineffective,"The cats notice it, walk warily by it for a short time but, after getting used to it, ignore it. Also, perhaps I missed it, but I son't believe the ads say anything about it being strictly for outside use. I primarily needed it for inside."
1,Cat Stop Just Stopped,"After only 4 weeks, this device just simply stopped working. I work away from home so I have no idea if it ever really kept my neighbor's cats away, but at least the light came on so I would think that it might have. I checked the battery and that was dry. I am just really disappointed in this unit. That is a lot of $$$ to just throw away. I need to re-visit Amazon's return policy, find the original box and receipt and try to get my money back. :0["
1,The cats outlasted the unit.,"To be quick and simple.. It did nothing to deter the cats from camping out by my front door so I moved it out by my bird feeders where the cats tend to stalk the birds. In three weeks I did not see a single cat respond to this thing, literally walking 3 feet in front of it as the red light went on ( the motion sensor shows when it's been triggered. I tried another set of fresh batteries and it still showed no effect. It's been on a shelf ever since because while it isn't worth the cost of the batteries I put into it, I also can't find the resolve to throw out something that cost me $50.Your better off with chicken wire or an airsoft pellet gun."
2,Get a dog.,Doesn't work. The cats dig right next to the catstop. The slight sound it makes just startals them. Save your money
1,Don't use indoors,"I tried a similar product (not from amazon.com) to keep my cats off of tabletops, and after a day my male cat was traumatized to the point that he wasn't eating or bathing (this is my glutton cat!). My female was not traumatized, but both cats were caught knocking the unit off the tabletop! I haven't tried it outdoors, but I would definitely not reccommend it for indoor use."
2,Product Recall,"Iam very displeased with this product currently have my 3rd.unit and thecats walk by it like it's invisible. I contacted the mfr. and they werekind enough to supply new items but they did not work as advertised.Iwould not recommend this product, I now have an electric fence arond thegarden area and no problem with cats."
1,Can't believe it's NOT working,"It's NOT working!The cats walk in front of it very casually. I can't believe that ""CATSTOP"" didn't work. Yes, I've tried to put it under roof, on the wall, on the fence, in front of door..... Nothing worked!"
4,So far so good!,"We have two set up in our back yard to preven a troublesome male coming into the yard, spraying the house, and disturbing our house cats - trust me they go ""Britney"" when the stranger comes into the yard. Since we set ours up we have not seen him in the yard and things are returning to normal. These ""Kitty Claymores"" work very well - Oh come on they do look like Claymore mines. I would have given a 5-Star rating but don't want to tempt faith."
3,Worked for a few weeks,Initially I was thrilled to see that these products kept the neighborhood cats away from their daily urine spraying my house. However they grew accustomed to the sound after about two weeks and have resumed their activities. I woke up two nights ago and noticed the red indicator light was on and sure enough there was the # 1 culprit sitting two feet in front of it. I bought two of these to coer the entire front of our house and am having serious shoppers remorse for spending $120 with S & H.
2,Does it even work?,"Purchased this in hopes it would keep my kitty out of my neighbors yard. Put it on the property line, didn't phase him at all. Changed batteries thinking it may be dead. You can't hear or see if it is doing anything. My cat wasn't even aware it was there."
2,Betty,"unfortunately the product did not work... at first we were excited but after a few days cats continued to use our front lawn as there litter box, we changed the battery but no go.. I will be returning it :("
1,garbage,"do yourself a favor & save your money. product is useless, cats walk right by on their way to my deck for a sunbath"
1,STOP? It doesn't stop anything!,"My neighbor rescues cats and then let's them roam the neighborhood or should I say, my property ONLY. Never less than 5 cats come/go as they please and CAT STOP doesn't STOP them .. it just doesn't do a thing! I feel bad that my neighbor purchased 5 units for me in hopes to deter but NOTHING. I wish they could get a full refund because it was money wasted. I will have to find other means to get rid of these darn cats pooping and living on my property. HELP ME PLEASE!!! Desperate!!!! My grandchildren nor I can't enjoy my yard - front back or sides - the cats are every where and they leave their nasty messy poop every where too!"
1,Cat Stop Does not work,I installed a year long extra life battery and installed the productin the yard. Two days later a cat walked up to the product - rubbed against it. Clearly it did not work at all. Outdoor Cat deterrent - sure it is! This is a product that does not work at all and I am glad it has a 30 day guarentee. I am returning it today.
2,Works for a month,"I should have heeded the warnings about this product per all of the Amazon reviews. I bought two of these to cover the entire front area of my house and they worked GREAT for one month. No cats, no poop, no issues. And then as if the product knew the return period expired, they stopped working. Cats now lounge around them as the light on the unit flickers on and off. What a waste of money."
1,Cats are still coming...,"I have this catstop in place at the corner of my shed, but cats have still entered the area, only 4 feet away, and they are passing within the 20' radius with no sign of discomfort. The only product that deterred them from the area is the scatmat I put right where they would leap from the other yard, and that was very effective. It was flipped over the very day I first put it out, probably when they leaped off the surface. I will try the catstop in another spot in the yard, but then will return it if they still come in.I had high hopes for this catstop and it does blink red when I pass it, so the batteries do work. The cats still make all the yards around my house smell with their constant pooping and have catfights late at night, tear up the deck furniture with their claws, jump on the roof and wake me up, then jump off the roof, tearing up the awnings and the outdoor swing's canopy on the way off. I'll try another product."
1,Not a catstop,We were very disappointed in the Contech CatStop. It has had absolutely no affect on cats using our garden as their toilet. We received the product in good condition and very quickly.
1,Cat stop,This product did not work at all. I have several neighbor cats who sleep on my porch furniture. I moved it closer and closer and they continued to sleep there. It is a total waste of money.
4,works....,"Battery connections had slipped inside device, had to fish them out with forceps. Product does appear to be working. Placed in front yard, cat went to other side of yard next day, moved Catstop to that side next day and cat appears to have moved on !"
