5,Teach Yourself Afrikaans,The fun of learning a new language is seen in this series the book follows the CD's well and id quite clear and well explained. My challenge is to remember what I have learned. Value for money is first class and the service from Amazon excellent to Australia.
1,This product is way to hard for a beginner,I have had this book and CD's now for a year and worked hard with them.. When I started I knew NO NOthing in Afrikaans.. A year later I learned 4 words from this book. It is a disorganized program.. Some of the program is only on the CD and some are only in the book.. So confusing.. Then I met another US friend and she told me she had the same experience. This is not a program for a beginner this is a program for an advanced person.. Even my husband who is Afrikaans said this was way to hard for a beginner. Now my friend is going to lend me her new program.. Thank goodness
2,Could be much better,"If I Compare this book with teaching yourself arabic this latter is much better structured. For example, in afrikaans' book, in its first unit the examples are not translated to english, the cd doesn't explain how to pronounce the pronouns, and so on. So is a little complicated to advance clearly."
1,Warning - Not a study guide,"If you're looking for material to prepare you for the Dantes test, get a college textbook instead of this one."
5,A Must Read,This book was not only a book I could not put down but it also helped me to realize that I don't have to live with secrets or in fear. I think that the author did an amazing job bringing the reader into the story and back out again with hope and inspiration. It's a definite plus for anyone who thinks they can not overcome the impossible in their lives.
1,Looking for sympathy?,"This book would have been a really good sob story, but I think you need to change you book or add in the abuse you have placed on other just to be fair and stop trying to make people buy your book becasue they feel sorry and want to hear your ""story"" of abuse!"
5,All of these...,"All of these stories and more can be found in ""Bestsellers Guaranteed."" Get that collection, it contains some of his best short stories. This is a nice item to have if you're a collector, though... great stories..."
4,"This is hard music, but not too hard.","The Birdmen are ""rippin' it up"" in this release. It features some very fast, very hard music, that you can scream along with and lose your voice - in a good way. This is the kind of music you can listen to at 3am driving cross country. It'll wake you up, boy."
4,Great Plugs,"I really enjoy having these plugs in my car. They have a high quality construction and went in nice and smooth. Out of the box, they were gapped slightly smaller than advertized, and they are a bit harder to set the gap on than regular plugs. Fortunately, the iridium center electrode that makes them harder to gap is what gives them their high performance, so I can live with that."
1,A big no,While it is a sweet story about overcoming loss. It took to long for me to get into the plot and the romance of it. Thumbs down
4,A Good Read,"I like to read Christmas stories. Christmas makes all things possible, this book was pleasant to read. A good way to spend the evening."
2,Fascinating story; irritating presentation,"The basic thesis is fascinating and very convincing; and not only because, in its broadest outline, actually very simple. With more data the story will surely become more complicated and perhaps less susceptible to documentary treatment. This is why I found 'The Real Eve' something of a disappointment.Perhaps on the assumption that the audience would not be able to follow the science, we are treated to a very extended infomercial complete with gravel voiced commentary, kaleidoscopic special effects and rather corny dramatic reconstructions of fatal confrontations between rival stone-age humans. But this is an idea which doesn't need to be 'sold', just explained; and a lay audience doesn't need to be beguiled, merely informed.Read the book: in 'The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa' (published in the UK as 'Out of Eden'), Stephen Oppenheimer tells the same basic story with much greater clarity much more convincingly."
5,The Real Eve is real incredible,"This documentary is one of the best produced documentaries I've ever seen. Not only is it facinating and incredibly researched, but the music in it elevates the subject matter to profound levels."
3,"Good information, overproduced","This product was purchased as an adjunct to a NOVA series entitled, ""Becoming Human."" A comparison may be unfair, considering the excellence of NOVA productions, but the difference is very noticeable. Music is distracting, even offensive in places, and many times too loud. Special effects look like time padding. Danny Glover is a fine actor, but he doesn't suit this subject. Not authoritative enough and voice is not like his usual. Most interesting is the information on coastal migration, and this is additive to the NOVA series, and makes that part valuable to students of the migratory patterns of our ancestors.The Real Eve: 5 Billion People From One Woman (Discovery Channel) [VHS]"
4,Important Information - Pooly Communicated,"This film conveys an important bit of information, however I had to watch the film quite a few times to fully grasp it. It traces the genetic path back 150,000 years ago to a single woman. However, it is not the HUMAN DNA that is traced, but rather the DNA of the mitochondia that live in our cells. The film never explains what mitochondia are, much less anything about the genetic markers. Frustrating. The film also suggests that humans left Africa through a SOUTHERN route rather than a northern one. However every time they mentioned this, they showed an unmarked map with an arrow pointed NORTHWARD. Frustrating. I would have given it 5 stars because I was so grateful to learn these things, but since I had to constantly repeat sections and consult an atlas and biology text, I give it 4 stars."
1,garbage,"I have worn nothing but Riggs for 2 years now for work. I have gone through 4 pairs. They have lasted longer than my Levi's or Carharts. I bought this type because of the double front. I normally buy the regular ones. These ripped between the top pad and the zipper all the way to the belt line while climbing in a work van no less. No catch no snag, just crappy denim. I love the standard riggs jeans and will order another pair. But I never even had these long enough to wash them."
2,Disappointing,"This book is a collection of ho-hum stories. The Nebula awards must be looking the other way - David G Hartwell has a far superior collection in Best SF 7.Only a few days after reading it, not one story has stuck in my mind."
3,Huge crotch,I thought this would look really sexy on my girlfriend so I bought it as a gift for her in her size. the waist fit fine but the crotch portion hung two inches down her thigh and she had to take it in.
2,Album title is deceptive,"I bought this album to play a particular song for my wedding, and I hoped that there were other songs on the CD that would be useful for the event. Most of the songs are either worship songs (fine in and of themselves, but not for a romance CD) or just cheesy love songs. I finally decided to just upload the one song that I liked and give the CD away."
5,A must-have for the beginning Paul scholar,"More of an encyclopedia of Paul's letters. All the important issues in Paul's letters are listed encyclopedically in this book. The articles' authors have looked at all the popular, scholarly and important commentaries, and have lined the commentators up on either side of every little minute Pauline controversy. Not sure where you fall on a matter of interpretation? This book will summarize the positions, their supporters, and tell you where to find the supporters' books. And even if you're not trying to determine what a specific text means, it's at least an interesting read to see where modern commentaries are taking modern Christianity."
2,No hypertext links in Kindle version!,"I would give the dictionary itself 5 stars for its excellent scholarship (I've been using the paper version for years), but the Kindle version has been seriously crippled by not making the entries clickable in the Subject Index and the Articles Index. Why in the world didn't they do this? Instead, you have to see if the article exists in the dictionary and then start randomly clicking in the progress bar until you find the article that you want. I can't believe I paid over $35 for the Kindle version and they didn't even provide this simple functionality for the reader! I had to hunt through dozens of pages in order to get to the articles that I wanted to look up. Please update this!!(I left the same complaint for The Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels.)"
5,Excellent reference book,"I am currently taking Pauline Writings in a MDiv program. This book is priceless and has become a ""must have"" for any library!!"
3,What were they thinking?,"First off, I LOVE the Little Bear series. My grandkids all love the series. And, all the DVDs I've purchased over time, have so far, all been GREAT. Except this one. On this one, they didn't flow from one episode to another, but put the lead-in and credits (shortened, but still there) in front and at the end of each episode! I am wondering if there is another version of this DVD that DOESN'T do this? It wasn't just annoying for me, it annoyed my grandkids too, especially the two year old. LOL!"
5,Cozy!,"Little Bear is such a cozy sweet series. I watched it as a child and now my 4 year old watches it as well. All the other cartoons out there are just awful... they talk to kids like they're idiots. Little Bear is calm, thought provoking, and SUPER SUPER cozy! I love curling up with tea and watching Little Bear and his family and friends. This DVD was based on the shows with Little Bear's Grandparents (good ones!!) I bought a bunch of these DVD sets like Rainy Days, Hurray for Little Bear etc. Just pop it in and it plays 10 episodes (over an hour of video!)"
1,Is this really necessary?,"I work in IT. Given the current state of the industry, I don't recommend it as a profession to my son, nor would I recommend it to my daughter, if I had one.The book is an example of research addressing the general question: ""Why oh why are other people not living their lives in ways that we, the researchers, deem appropriate?"" There may be a book-length explanation to that, but then again, maybe they just don't feel like it."
1,No iPad support???,"As the textbook industry advances and Ed tech advances as well, it should be a given that anything available for kindle download or e-book download should be available for all the major platforms. Amazon mentions Mac, PC, Kindle, and iPad in its description for use with their free kindle app, yet this isn't available for the most popular tablet...It receives one star until I am able to download it for use on my iPad."
5,Organizational Behavior,"The book was said to be in new conditon and when it was received, it couldn't have in better condition, it was perfect, exactly what was promised to be."
4,Organizations,"I enjoyed this text book and found it helpful not only for the course, but in evaluating my own behavior within the workplace setting. The text was well written and easy to understand.Thank you"
2,Mixed Messages doesn't clarify,"Surprisingly, this compilation of essays is primarily centered around dismantling multiracialism because--as the authors vehemently argue--the multiracial movement is naively or insidiously distracting traditional progress (or lack thereof) for black racial justice. I read statements that compared multiracialism with ""neoconservatism"" which can be disconcerting for anyone who is accustomed to reading Marie P.P. Root's books, which take a more compassionate and emic approach to the studying of the multiracial experience.If you are looking for a book which addresses multiracialism from the standpoint of multiracials, which addresses interesting unique experiences that multiracials trek through, then this is NOT the book for you. But if you are interested in primarily criticizing multiracialism and are only interested in Black and Non-Black race relations, then I would suggest this book."
2,Dissapointing,A mopping brush? You got to be kidding me. Maybe for a chicken leg or two. I am a serious grill enthusiast who cooks quite often outdoors and I had high hopes for this silicon brush mop. It is neither large enough or long enough to do the job unless you are cooking for maybe two people. Heat loss when raising the grill lid is an important factor when grilling or smoking meats and the tiny surface area of this mop will cause you to waste alot of time mopping on your sauce if you are cooking any substantial amount of food. Good idea that needs at least 4 times the surface area at best.
5,Great Brush! Baste Without Waste,I typically do not like silicone but this one is great for basting without wasting.
5,Fabulous and easy to clean,"At first, I was skeptical about it cleaning so well. But it truly does and it spreads the marinade perfectly even over whatever you are cooking. It is light weight and angled just right. It cleans right up in the dishwasher. Great product!"
2,"Different and original, but not good !!",This has some two or three songs worthwhile. THe rest is to forget.
4,Only wife-friendly Purple-orbit winner,"I love everything Gillan does. Just thought I'd mention that my wife... doesn't. But she *loves* this album. It's a great album for parties if you want to put on something that everyone will think is okay, quite a few people will really like, and which will surprise anyone who isn't familiar with it. The metal-heads will be surprised it is Gillan. The people who listen to Coldplay will be surprised it's ""the guy from Deep Purple"" and the folks into opera and musicals will be surprised it's ""the guy from Jesus Christ Superstar""."
3,A fun record,"This is a really fun record with a lot of very good material on it. Its obvious that Ian and Roger had a great time making this record.The sound is much richer than you might expect from what is essentially a homemade recording. Just don't expect it to sound anything like Deep Purple or even like a typical Gillan solo album. This is a much looser off-the-cuff affair covering several different musical styles.Glover's vocal spotlight on ""She Took My Breath Away"" is nothing special, but ""Clouds and Rain"", ""Evil Eye"", and ""Telephone Box"" rank with the best of Gillan's solo work. Definitely worthwhile for fans of Ian Gillan."
2,Sounds dated now.,"I just went through an Ian Gillan listening fest, and ended it with ""Accidentally on Purpose."" I bought this when it came out, and didn't think too much of it then. Upon listening to it now, after several hours of Gillan's solo work and ""Born Again,"" his great album with Black Sabbath from 1983, I have to say that I was completely underwhelmed. ""Accidentally on Purpose"" has that ""worst of the eighties"" keyboard sound that has not aged well over the last nineteen years. If you want an excellent Ian Gillan vocal performance and have all the Deep Purple he was on, I suggest you purchaseGlory Roadan exceptional record or the afore mentionedBorn AgainIt received two stars because it is still Gillan doing the vocals, but song-wise, music-wise, it isn't worth one star."
2,It's different from Deep Purple,"The reason why Ian Gillan and Roger Glover choose to record an album on their own was probably due to the character of the songs, i.e. they didn't fit Deep Purple. This album is a bit uneven but it's pleasantly diverse. The opening ""Clouds and rain"" is the highlight and a very strong song. ""She took my breath away"" is a quiet and laid back number where Gillan's voice is in focus, and also one of the finer moments on the album. But if you're looking for real hard rocking tracks you better look elsewhere, even if Gillan & Glover have thrown in some decent but rather average rockers. Some of the songs are a bit odd and very hard to categorize in a certain genre. Even if bits and pieces are very good and the mentioned ""Clods and rain"" is great, I can't give this effort any higher rating than 2 stars - but that doesn't mean it's worthless."
4,Sleeper of the millenium?,"I bought this album in 1988 when it was first released and thought it might be the ""sleeper"" hit of the year. The music is stylistically diverse, but mostly fun and upbeat. It still sounds fresh and original 10+ years later."
2,TOO MUCH IRREGULAR,"One good song, one bad song; one good song, one horrible song... THat's how this CD goes forever. ""CLouds and Rain"" and the reggae orientated ""She Took My Breath Away"" are the best songs. The rest is, to be modest, strange... Ian Gillan put the blame for the failure of this recording (in his autobiography) on the label. It's not. He also said that this is the album he listen mostly of all the records he has ever made!!! I think he wrote that just like a merketing ploy, for readers and fans go and buy the album!!! (it worked with me!!!!!!)"
2,Poor workmanship,"The only saving grace of this shelf is the leveling knobs at the bottom of each leg...other wise, there would be no way to keep the thing straight. The plastic caps that are designed to hold the top shelf in place slide and the drawer is not as functional as it looks. I also made the mistake of thinking that the width of the shelf was adjustable- just the height of the drawer is adjustable. Consequently I can't use the shelf in the cabinet that I had planned. My mistake. Won't be buying from this company again."
4,"Great product, terrible instructions","We bought one of these to fit a tricky space under our bathroom sink. It's pricey, but it was the only organizer that we found that would fit the space we had.If you're familiar with the plastic snap collar type connectors, this goes together pretty easily and when it's together it's pretty sturdy.Recommended!"
5,One of the best books to shape my life!,Dr. Cloud knows what he is talking about. The principles from this book are all biblically sound and have provided great focal points for me to improve my life.
5,This is a practical guide.,I really enjoyed reading this book. Those nine things listed are easy to follow and apply. I especially like the first four principles (dig it up; pull the tooth; play the movie; do something) since they really riled me up to start doing something about it. This book provided motivation and acute focus on what I want out of life. I do recommend this book to help one to stay focused and on the forefront of their life's goals.
4,a good success book,"Cloud does a good job on how to have a successful life. First, you must find what you would like to do as a career. Second, deal with problems by fixing it or eliminating it. Third, create a well thought out plan step by step all the way to reaching successs. Also think about options and see if they will hurt you or help you in the future. Fourth, be proactive, be a person of action. Fifth, be dilligent and industrious by doing something and make progress, no matter how small the progress is. Sixth, Be sure to fix what you hate in a positive way. Seventh, do not seek justice for yourself, seek rather to give mercy and forgive. Eighth, study and grow in humility. Ninth, realize that you cannot please everyone."
2,Poor Copy of the CD,The CD's did not play the entire narration. Some disk work some did not; important information not able to hear because of the poor copy quality of the disk. Previous owner never should had sold this copy.
3,"Good advice, too much blatant proselytizing","The advice and anecdotes are good, but the only supporting material are bible verses. That wouldn't be so bad, though it is rather often, except for the very blatant proselytizing about accepting Jesus. Can do without that. Perhaps it would be easier to skip over in the text version."
3,what men think,"a Mans view, I agree to clean out my closet, meditation has served me best, use your talents and gifts, and some men are wrong with what they need from a women..Anyway I have not read all the book as I was busy, and i usually go my own way . I am a bit of a rebel in my thinking.and the way i act.So I think I will do my own thing. thanks, but i will keep the book."
5,Must Read,"This is a MUST read for 2007. It is very good, and very practical and really makes you think. It's is beautifully written. Hands down, amazon is by far the cheapest."
5,"Profound, important lessons of life","This takes some study and time to read, but the basics rules of life in the book come from decades of counseling and therapy work by this fine doctor.My favorite and most difficult to achieve? To do the right thing, even though others may become angry or upset. So hard if you are raised to be polite and always try to please. But totally necessary to accomplish what you must in life.Good job, Dr. Cloud."
5,BEST OF THE BEST,"Blaze picked the perfect book to launch its new series. I have two copies of this book as a failsafe in case I ever misplace one! To be honest, I haven't read a romance novel since which has measured up to the anticipation, passion, and satisfaction that this book offered. The prequel story in Midnight Fantasies about sister BJ is wonderful as well."
5,NOTORIOUSLY HOT!!-Harlequin Blaze,This book was great. I started reading Harlequin Blaze again because I remember reading some books in the past. Forgot the names of them. But I printed out the First 100 books and I'm starting to read them all!! Great Book to start with from the Blaze Series! Can't Wait to read more!!
4,Solid Read,"For those who like the Sr. Frevisse novels, this is a solid entry in the series. It's not the best of them, but - especially at the surprisingly low price for the Kindle edition - certainly worth the money. Satisfyingly unexpected outcome, lots of medieval detail. A map of St. Frideswide's might be helpful since a good part of the action takes place there or nearby."
2,The story has no plot twists and is carelessly written,"This murder mystery is set in midievil times. The main character is very likeable, not because she is a nun, but because she does NOT fir the nun stereotype. This book might be enjoyed by people who liked the Father Dowling Mystery Series or who are interested in life in 15th century Europe."
5,"More, please!",A delight to read this accurate background to a gripping tale. The characters grow with every book. Sister Frevisse is a great find!
1,Special effects with this type of filters is gone. use Photoshop after picture taken,Special effects with this type of filters is gone. use Photoshop after picture taken. Effect results not satisfactory and thing of the past
2,This is a 'beginners' book...,"Really it is. I bought the book based on the numerous complimentary reviews, but as I have been going through it I have found virtually no new or unique tips or tricks - and I am not some stellar programmer. I think it is a good book for people who are creating their first web page and don't want it to look terrible. To be a sport I will say that my mopst used ""tips and tricks"" kind of book is HTML Artistry: More Than Code."
5,One word...,"excellent! Well written, easy to understand at any level. You'll learn great (yet, useful) tricks that always made you wonder, ""How'd they do that? """
1,save your money,"I purchased this book based on the outstanding reviews listed here, however, I was really disappointed when the book arrived. First of all, the books should be renamed Tips and Tricks with Javascripting, as most of the examples use javascripting and not HTML. I found a number of the links examples to be expired. Many of the tricks mentioned have been rendered useless by the advent of Dreamweaver 3. If you are looking for Web design books, choose another, there are plenty of them out there. If you are looking for HTML tricks save your money and use the numerous web sites that offer these."
3,books from provident booksellers,"I would love to review this book (and the other book I ordered) but the honest truth is that it has been over a month and I still haven't received either of them!!!! Yes, I received an email stating that they were shipped out on October 9th but here it is November 12th and I still don't have them! Funny thing about this, is I ordered a CD player from Newegg 10 days ago, and just received it today. I wish amazon would have just shipped it instead of provident booksellers. Maybe I'll think twice next time."
5,A gem at twice the price!,"This book is so chock-full of ideas that i hope Ibanez & Zee write a whole library. It has a colorful, engaging layout, tons of great ideas, a nice little condensed HTML reference, and a page that shows the different features supported by various browser releases-- in short, everything u need in one little book! My only criticism: I wish it were longer!If anyone else has another favorite book, i'd love to hear about it-- but this is MY FAVORITE. This book should be a BESTSELLER!"
2,Filler,"Kind of crumbly, and dries to a grayish finish. I had to go over with a black crayon to make it look right."
2,Mildly interesting,"This book would have been better served if there had been an editor to keep Mr. Vincent on track. He wanders about, stumbling on some gems of stories but mostly getting bogged down with unimportant, irrelevant, and uninteresting tales."
1,Michelin Green Guide to Italy,The book never arrived. I contacted the seller after 3 weeks; the seller asked me to wait another week. The book never arrived. I contaced the seller again but the seller ignored my emails. I ultimatley had to get a refund from Amazon.
5,Excellet,My cousin and Keith wrote an excellent story explaining the complications of today's prejudises. This is a must see for muture adults
5,Favorite Celtic album,"If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have one album of instrumental music, Banish Misfortune would be my choice. Malcolm Dalglish and Grey Larsen are immensely talented -- I saw them play at McCabe's in LA in the early 1980's, and they were brilliant, especially Dalglish on hammered dulcimer. Most of the tracks are instrumental (hammered dulcimer, English concertina, guitar, flute, tin whistle, alto recorder, anglo); there are vocals on Christ Child's Lullaby. Most of the songs are traditional Irish, Northumbrian or North Hebridian tunes; a few tunes are original. My favorite track on this album is March Of The King Laois / Brian Boru's March. The melody starts off so simply, and then is increasingly embellished. This track, and Christ Child's Lullaby, are tracks that bring peace to my soul."
4,A self-help book that actually helps,"Rando's ebullient personality comes through her writing, and I found this book inspiring. She presents good ideas for analyzing the way you think and demonstrates how your thoughts limit you. She gives thoughtful, practical ideas for turning your good ideas into action. I particularly liked her section on remembering the good things you've accomplished in the past and building on the self-esteem they foster. Rando is one of those writers you'd like to do lunch with!Four stars instead of five because art director puts exercises in miniscule type on colored background and they are extremely difficult to read. Illustrations are lovely, however, and basically this book looks wonderful, which in some ways enhances the text. But someone should have overruled the art director on type size. In a self-help book, content is more important than the look of the book. You'll find plenty of content here -- if you can read it."
5,Leasrn to Power Think,This is a perfect book for people who need to make changes in their lives so they can be more productive and happier. Young and old can benefit from reading this book and using the exercises therin to bring about lifestyle changes and unlearn old bad habits. that hold them back from getting the most out of life.
2,Missing a few weeks for planning,I have bought this lesson plan book in the past. It is the best plan book I have found up until this last purchase. I am a teacher and need 40 weeks of plans. Unfortunately this year the plan book only contained 35 weeks. Where did the extra 5 weeks of planning pages go? I had to take my time and copy extra pages from the book so I would have enough to plan for the year. I am very disappointed and frustrated with the situation. I would have called to complain to receive a new book but I had already written in the plan book not expecting the 5 weeks to be missing.
1,They should be horsewhipped,"No one should be allowed to sell software that cannot communicate with versions of Word that are current. This program cannot talk to Word versions developed after 1999. I contacted the company and got a smug reply, 'you should have read the box before opening it'... Caveat emptor."
5,looping electric minimalist beautiful stuff,"When I heard the track ""commerce server"" on KCMU, I knew I had to own it. Diskont reminds me of Eno's ambient works, updated to 90s electronica, after a quad espresso, made of metal. Part Cage, part Reich. Ive come to expect that only 1 in 5 CDs I buy will be truly interesting and wonderful. For me, this is that 5th CD. It resonates in my head well after I take the headphones off."
2,Way too expensive,"This product will NOT ""diminish appearance of fine lines"". I have a lot of experience with chemical peels, and a 20% AHA is way to weak. The product itself is ok. It's just a weak acid mixed into a lotion. But it's very expensive and it's smaller than my hand. Only 1 ounce ( 30g) for 47 Dollars? Ridiculous. Would not recommend."
4,Another great follow-up!,"The third book in the Wildflower series is as good as the other two. The story is charming and the romance is not sex driven. It is relationship driven, a nice thing when so many other books are all about the sex. This has a great storyline and I enjoyed how it brought all three books togethet."
5,My Heart Remembers,"I loved this book, I wish there were a book 4 in this series. An easy read that drew you in quick."
5,My Heart Remembers,"This book I was not sure I wanted to read at first when reading the series. Lisa was a fluff character I thought. Yes, sister to a main character but still fluff. Although, I have to tell you I am so pleased I did read it after all. This was a love story of two people who fell in love at the wrong time & in the wrong place. Shane is a cop in NYC & Lisa I an apprentice designer of jewelry under Alex White. But, Alex is being investigated by Shane who through Lisa's help puts Alex in prison with Alex's permission. But after recovering all pieces of jewelry but one necklace. At court Lisa court Lisa comes to the conclusion that Shane had only spent all those extra dinners, walks, & outing as part of his job & not for just her. So, she leaves for home & changes from this carefree artistic type to this straight lace predictable always working woman. Eight years go by & that's where all the fun begins.I would highly recommend this book."
2,NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION,How did this series get on the Christian Fiction list? Which is what I always pull up when I'm shopping for books. So I tho't nothing of ordering them. They are not Christian books and I think you should remove them from that list.
1,"I'd like my $3.99 back, please.",The pits... I can only assume that the 4 and 5 star reviews are from readers who just need words in their face 24/7 and the quality of the story doesn't matter.
2,Power DVD works most of the time,"The quality is poor, but it is the best of the DVD player software. It is ridiculous to charge more money for audio support. Also, sometimes the software hangs or doesn't see the disk in the drive."
4,surprisingly good,"A bitter reporter challenges a radio sexpert to prove her theory that nobody can be seduced against her will, and enlists a hunky race car driver and well-known ladies man to try to seduce her.Going for It was surprisingly good--I was pretty well grabbed by this one.My only problem was that I couldn't get over the premise. I did like the sexpert's message reminding women that it is a choice, but it seems to me that all decisions to have sex involve seduction in some way. Just an unfortunate choice of words, I suppose, but because it was such a big part of the story, I spent the first half of the book pondering that rather than the story itself."
2,Wierd after taste,"I just tried this bar, and was not impressed. There was a strange after taste that I could not get over. I have not tried the other flavors, but I was not a big fan of the apple"
2,It's green!!! Yuck!,I bought these for my picky three yr old. He doesn't eat anything that's green. I thought he would try them because he loves granola. They aren't very attractive and kind of smell weird. The taste is OK but he refused to try them. Not a winner with me!
4,Another excellent album.,"I was excited to find this album, but saddened to learn it was Pete Bardens' last. It is a strong ""new age"" disc very consistent with his previous releases. Also check out ""Speed of Light"" and, what I believe to be his personal best, ""Water Colors."""
4,One Of Best European Death Metal Band,"Inveracity is amazing band, their skill is very god, i very like this band and this album is very god quality too"
4,It's Worth A Couple Of Stars,"This record is not as bad as people claimed it to be. I happened to be a fan of tribute albums and I would say that this one is a keeper. I read the awful reviews previous to this and I still bought the album. There are a few tracks that aren't too good, but there are some standout tracks. The remakes of the songs Ray Of Light, Holiday and Live To Tell were quite fascinating to me, as well as a few others. Keep in mind, this is a TRANCE tribute, so give credit to the fact that this is a cross between Madonna and rave music. And the packaging on this CD was great too (the cardboard outer case). The only dissapointment I can say was the number of tracks, there should have been more than 10. This is a really good CD, I like it."
5,I don't care what anyone says!,I don't care what anyone says. I LOVE this cd and everyone I've ever let borrow it loves it as much as I do. So there! lol If you love Madonna how can you not like this. I ignore all purist opinions. Honestly. This is good stuff yall! HELLO!!!!!!! : )
3,Read carefully.....,"This is not the latest edition. I stupidly ordered it and then realized the 9th edition was out. Gave it to a friend. The Whitburn Book is a constant resource in my work, and this one was fine... I just didn't realize it wasn't up to date. Make sure you're getting the 9th (or whatever the most recent edition is by the time you read this)."
3,The Good and the Bad,"I fell in love with the first edition of this book, and every few years a new edition is released.My interest in Top 40 music ended sometime around 1980, and the later stuff in this book just gets in the way.But on the other hand, each edition seems to add more information about many of the songs and artists from pre-1980, and THAT is the information I want.What I'm saying is that I'd love to see the edition that ended in 1980 re-released, with all the updated song and artist information that appears in the latest edition."
5,Pure gold!,I want Joel on my trivia team!!! I've worn out 2 previous editions and can't wait for the 9th. So much info you'll be blown away!
4,Excellent Reference Tool With a Few Errors,"This book does contain a few errors: Danny's Song was not originally by Loggins & Messina but by Gator Creek a short-lived group Kenny Loggins was in. It mentions that Donovan was in the movie Brother Sun Sister Moon... he only wrote the songs. Of course we don't have to see ""Atlantis"" defined as a ""legendary continent in the Atlantic Ocean"" the song clearly states that. I'm glad they took out the awful rumor about him living in retirement from '74 to about '81."
5,behind the music,Great info on pop acts. A fun trip down memory lane and a lot of stuff you've forgotten or didn't even know. Amazing how many people have passed through these charts over the years. Lots of great photos. What I really liked was going through this book by year though. Interesting to see how tastes change.This could be the text book on US/pop culture.Good for anybody who is into music (obviously) but also a fun trivia book.
5,The only music book you will ever need for Top 40 Hit info!,"As a mobile disc jockey and former radio announcer, I couldn't survive without this book. Joel is the BEST! I have almost 20,000 songs in my collection and was able to find all the important info such as year, chart position, and who was in the groups that made the songs famous. I love using this book to play trivia during parties as I know the info is always correct. I'm on my third edition and it's the only book I use. I can't wait for the next one to be published. If you love music like I do, then this book is the one that will answer all your questions and needs for music trivia or just information for your own personal use. Steve Whateley, ""Steve The D.J."""
5,Definitive guide to US hit singles,"This is THE definitive guide to US Top 40 singles and is one of the very few sources of this kind of detailed information from the birth of rock and pop music from its origins in the mid 50s to the present (particularly here in England where it's only available as an import). If I have a criticism, it's that the current edition was published in 1996 and only covers singles up to the end of 1995, As such, it's well overdue an update!"
4,List rich,"Good reference guide, even though it is behind about ten years. It is succinct with descriptions of bands, although the lists are exhaustive."
4,Just what I wanted!,This edition lits the hits that most people forgot! I was looking for info on one it wonders and other fun trivia that we could enjoy at work. This book was it!
5,A must for every music lover & great for gifts,"There are certain books that are sure fire bets if you have to buy a gift for someone and don't know what to get. This is such a book!! Every artist who had a top 40 hit single since 1955 is listed and all of the artist's top 40 hits are listed. If you remember a song years ago and remember who recorded it, if it made the top 40, it is in this book. What a great way to rediscover nearly forgotten recordings you once liked. I highly recommend this book."
5,8th Edition Another Winner,"The 8th Edition of ""The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits"" is another winner. Those familiar with this series already know that this book will be an outstanding research tool for radio stations and music collectors. The 8th Edition, written by Joel Whitburn, is another ""must have"" for anyone serious about music chart performance. Joel's reputation for compiling and publishing chart data in an interesting and useful format is well recognized, and this edition covers the entire time span of 1955-2003. Whitburn's books can get so much use as valuable reference tools, that it's easy to wear out the binders. Can't wait for the 9th edition!"
2,New Age kindergarten teacher style instruction.,"I'm searching for the perfect yoga video, and I'm beginning to realize there is no such bird, although some get closer than others. In this video the first set is an acceptably nice, relaxing do-able 32 min. set, but the second seems a bit kinky, ending with something that encourages free body movement. I'm personally not interested in watching these people gyrating around in a way which moves them but not me. The instructor speaks with the most irritating delivery, speaking as though we are kindergarteners. I may use this on creaky mornings, but only if I'm steady enough not to want to punch the instructor's lights out."
1,Cripple You Yoga,"I bought and tried this video and found it to be absolutely crippling! I can't move! This is truly ""cripple you yoga""!"
5,Worth the money.,"I have about a half dozen Yoga tapes and this is the one that gets played the most. The title is exactly what it says - gentle Yoga and its probably the easiest Yoga tape that I have.Personally, I use mine about 30 minutes before bedtime.The tape is divided into 2 sections that are each about 30 minutes in length. The first section is more structured and the second section is more free form. Even beginners should be able to do most of the exercises without too much of a problem.In this tape there are no wrap your ankles behind your ears or stand on your head type activities. The pace, the voicing and the exercises are all designed to simply relieve stress and loosen up those tight muscles and joints. If this is all you want, then you need look no further."
3,ram teri ganga maili,The movie is ok if you wound like watch it with all the singing it has. ram teri ganga maili Could have less singing and more of the movie so we can enjoy it better.
5,Another generic compliment...,"This book was in absolutely fantastic condition when I bought it, and it is a good read. Good service, and good shipping. It came later than expected, but earlier than what they said it would. I guess I should read the estimated shipping dates, but it came sooner than that and in awesome condition. Good buy all around. Thank you for the book, and when the 6th one comes out, I will buy from you again."
1,"Lots of ""Flash"". Very Little Material...","Wow, they sure spent a lot of time and money making sure they got ""cool"" effects for the section intros. Too bad there is so little material. Oh, and instead of wide angle shots of playing the songs why not more split screen of right and left hands with Tab. Too much trouble I guess. WAY too many shots of a wiggling hand on a fretboard while being told that there are many more variations you COULD learn (that they don't show!) If you think you will learn these whole songs guess again. So little to work with here. I'm cured of buying ANY Songxpress title from here on out.Thanks for nuthin'"
4,Good Instructional DVD,"The instructor repeats each section a few times at slow and normal speed. You won't learn the exact leads, but you'll learn enough to sound like you know what you're doing."
2,As usual...sizzle but no steak,"The problem with this (and most DVD and CD supported guitar instruction programs) is that the instruction is incomplete and misleading. The instructor shows a few chords and a basic lick. However, what is shown is so basic that it could be picked up for free on u-tube. Now, the DVD does provide nice versions of the songs, but the problem is the versions played are not the ones taught. The instructor adds lots of embellishment and flourishes, but gives no information on these additions. While no DVD can teach the subtleties of performance, at least the TAB for the performance could be included. Even without direct and explicit instruction, the addition of COMPLETE TABS would lead to an excellent product. As is, the product looks good, but has little substance."
3,"Too Basic, leaves out song details.","As a beginner / intermediate guitarist, I like the SongXpress series of DVD's (originally done on video tape and bought up by Alfred Music) because they are basic and can get anyone playing the core fundamental of any song they offer but sometimes they tend to be too basic and this is the case with Classic Blues vol. 1They teach you the basic chord patterns or maybe the easiest of riffs but then at the end, the song is performed in a manner much advanced from what you were taught with no way of picking up the advanced material. You are left with a feeling of frustration and being left out.I would have rated it 2 stars but in the additional materials section there is an 8 min instructional on 7th and 9th chords that I found very valuable.If you just picked up the guitar there are better beginning DVD's, if your intermediate in your skills this is going to leave you frustrated. If someone gives it to you don't throw it away."
2,Quite A Story,"While it is no surprise that ""the region"" has it's shortcomings, the author clearly had an ax to grind. Much of this story revolves around high school drama that is not endemic to ""the region."" The drug stories are good and clearly authentic. However, the story is a tale of youthful indiscretions. Rather than accepting responsibility for his actions, the author chooses to blame the environment for his hardships. The title is misleading. While the author would like the reader to believe that all these bad things happen to him because of ""the region"" and the people who live there, much of his misfortune is brought on by his own propensity for gossip and drug abuse. While I'm happy that he has finally found peace and happiness in Seattle, this reviewer feels that the author should move on. Furthermore, I have never read a book with so many typos. It was almost if it was never proofread. I'm not sure if this was symbolic, but I found it to be quite annoying. All in all, it has potential."
4,Good read,"This is a good read for anyone who is from a metropolitan area or anyone who wants to know what it is like to grow up in one. It is a great read for anyone who grew up in ""The Region"". It is a true account of typical teenage life in that area."
5,Great product...,"I run my old VHS and VHS-C camcorder tapes through a time-base corrector and then through this and capture on my computer for transfer to DVD. Excellent results.Also, since it's bi-directional, using Sony Vegas software I can mount this thing as a preview device to send the preview video out to a monitor through it. That's pretty cool since I don't have to render anything to see what the finished product is going to look like.I would highly recommend this product."
4,Works as advertised,"Plug & play. Converting Hi-8 tapes to MPEGs in minutes. A couple of dropped frames from time to time, but nothing serious. Could be the computer."
2,No Time Based Correction - Otherwise Good Product,"The product is very well designed, has good features and is simple to operate. Just not able to use it on the older VHS tapes because of no time based correction. Called the company, excellent technical support and they walked me through many alternatives but was not successful. So it was returned with no complications...."
3,"Good Start, Slow Ending","I really loved the the way the book began. It kept my 2 1/2 year old's attention until after the 3rd Little Pig's stone house. And then the author added a very long away around to end the story. It made no sense to me why they did it that way and my son, who is very good with concentration, loses interest as well as myself. So I have to make up the end of the story myself to keep his attention. Since my son loves the huffing and puffing, he likes to read the beginning. The great beginning, nice photos are worthy of a 3, but too long winded in the end. There are so many versions of this story, I think there could be a better one out there. However, I have no recommendations at this time."
5,SUMMER READING CLASSIC,"My son had to read this, well I had to read to him over the summer before going into Kindergarten, a nice read with great illustration. Amazing what he has learned this first year in Kindergarten, now he can read it himself . Classic"
4,Another Train,It's an amazing album of great female musicians and singers. I can not tell how moved I am by 'Another Train.' It's the best song I've heard in a long time to truly reflect and think about what life is all about.
3,disappointing,"It took me great perseverence to get through this book. At times I found it utterly uninteresting - this self-obsessed whining about relationships that are going the wrong way, the details about boring parties, all the repeats when describing the characters. I suppose it's a good thing Leavitt didn't make his own life and character look better- but maybe he should have. I don't really like Martin Baumann, nor his friends, nor anyone. Which should not be a problem if you feel that the person is experiencing mental growth. Here, none of that happens. Leavitt used to be good for his pointed, measured sentences. Now he's blabbing along for much too long. The earlier books may have been as he admits here - untrue and gloating - at least they were a better read."
3,Leavitt can do much better,"I'm one of David Leavitt's biggest fans and have read all of his prior books. Doing so has lead me to have very high expectations of his work, and this book disappointed. While I found the underlying commentary on relationships intelligent, the delivery was rather torturous. Martin Bauman may be a minimalist writer; Leavitt, in this book, was the antithesis of minimalism. I found my patience tested by a seemingly interminable string of cocktail parties and other plot events whose value in character development was questionable at best.If you are a fan of Leavitt's work you will probably still enjoy this book. If you have not read any of his previous work, I wouldn't start here. His short story collections and books like Lost Language of Cranes and While England Sleeps are far better showcases of his talent."
4,"Brave, honest, and very well-written","A very good book by Leavitt, who moves up a notch or two on my short list of favorite contemporary authors. His writing style, as always, is intelligent, fluid, often funny. The story is captivating, even moreso for being, basically, biographical. A literate, psychologically-adept description of the life of someone, not unlike myself, who struggles, often with painful awareness, with his ghosts and unfulfulled needs. An honest account of a time in the life of this wonderful author. While sometimes depressing, it is also often funny, touching and inspiring. I can handle an emotional moderately-wild ride if I have some sense of resolution by the end. This newest by Leavitt provides that in its somewhat difficult, though insightful, conclusion. I highly recommend it."
4,Extemely Enjoyable,"Well, unlike most of the other review, I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Perhaps I'm biased, I'm a huge fan of Leavitt's prior work. I found Bauman to be a fantastically fun and easy read. Did much of it seem semi-autobiographical? Of course, but isn't that what writing is most of the time? It seems Leavitt is testing his character development skills with Bauman, really getting inside the head of the young protagonist and letting us inside the intimate thoughts and desires of this nineteen year old, and personally I found the ride fantastic."
1,A shockingly ugly and small-minded novel,"from a writer we expect much more of. Leavitt seems mired in his past, not all of which is of interest to the rest of us. What was he thinking when he started down this road? A disappointing performance from an otherwise gifted novelist."
3,interesting clues about a writer's life,"no-one can help noticing that Martin Bauman, albeit its insistence on its being a novel, is only a mere autobiography in disguise, and as such we shoul view it. Not only is it akward to draw comparisons with other Leavitt's works - it is also inappropiate, unless we should will to cast a light on their bearance on actual facts, which Martin Bauman provides us with.As an autobiography, Martin Bauman is a fine book. It reveals many of its authors preocccupations at the time when he was forging a writing career for himself. It is also an interesting cultural reflection on gay life at the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's, a subject matter Leavitt had refrained himself from probing up to this book, at least in such a straightforward way."
3,"Martin Bauman, Crashing Bore","The blatantly autobiographical book with just enough fiction to make things the way you WISH they'd been is always a dangerous road to take. This book is a weird combination of dead-on details (the publishing parties!) and crashing boredom. Nobody in the book is likable, it's true, but more importantly, nobody is even interesting. The Stanley Flint as mentor seems to be totally random--when nothing's going on with the main characters, we'll bring him in to knock Bauman back down a few pegs. It's a shame that Leavitt's initial promise has gone down in major flames, but really, he hasn't written anything good since While England Sleeps."
2,Disappointing,Usually I look forward to a new book by this author and when I saw this one I immediately bought it. Now I want my money back. After finishing the book I realized that I hadn't liked any of the characters and was disenchanted by the plot which seemed to echo the angst of the 80's.
1,Depressing,"On page 292 of his novel, Leavitt writes: ""It is always disturbing to recognize the capacity for malice in friends whom we are used to viewing as generous and kind"". I'm sure Gary Glickman and Meg Wolitzer are feeling something along those lines in the aftermath of this thoroughly depressing novel. Had there been any art involved, of course, the issue of mined relationships would be moot, but autobiography is all this book has going for it, and there is little here to admire."
3,too much cake,"I buy this book each year and will continue to do so. However, my first impressions of this book is too many cakes are featured. From my party and family gathering experiences I find that very few people will eat cake during the holidays. Small bites of fabulous desserts are more popular. When you commit to a whole piece of cake it limits the other goodies you can sample. So, a recipe book full of cake is not what I had hoped for in this issue."
3,Punkinhead,Not what I expected. I have most of the other editions and it seems they took the best of the past 25 years and put it all in one book. I hope that 2006 edition is better!!!
5,Best Laundry Soap in the World!,"There is no other laundry soap that can compare to this one! It only takes 2 tablespoons per load (perhaps 3 if you have very hard water). No stinky perfumes, no dyes, no fillers. It just safely cleans your clothes. We have dogs and horses and do a lot of nasty outdoor dirty work. It cleans everything perfectly. Excellent for baby diapers and clothes. Works equally well in hot, warm or cold water. No animal ingredients, no animal testing. If you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to chemicals, this is the product for you! I particularly appreciate that their packaging is sensible (we recycle the box) and that the product is so concentrated. They are trying to leave a smaller footprint on the earth with their manufacturing process. I just with other companies would follow suit."
5,awesome cd,Ikahba voice is awesome. This is one of the best reggae cd's I have ever heard. Excellent beats. A must have.
4,"Remo 10"" head key tuned djembe","This is a nice drum, especially for the money. I will never need to worry about the climate I play in, because it's synthetic. And I was amazed at how good this one sounds. I have had bigger Remo djembes that I did not like the sound as well. But I love the way this small one articulates. It probably isn't as nice as a real wooden drum, but it's lighter, and I think more durable. All in all, well worth the money I paid!"
4,Early Eddie Higgins,"Very relaxed jazz that is well performed. The musicians are all top drawer musicians that play in the jazz/swing orchestras. It is straight ahead jazz. As with all recordings made by VeeJay, the sound is really quite lively. This is one of those budget reissues. It is not likely to be around long.Eddie Higgins is not one of those pianists that seems to stress virtuosity. His approach is friendly and very accessible. If you like his style of playing, he has produced a slew of trio records, some solo records, and a few small combo recordings all on the Venus label out of Japan.This record is a keeper, but is is in the nature of a blowing session. It is not a concept album by a unique composer. It is something to enjoy, but it does not stay with you long."
5,the best book on teaching and undestanding collection,"I learned dressage from Jan Dickerson in the 1970s and 1980s. She was an outstanding teacher who really understood horsses and was able to explain in ways that made complicated concepts easy to understand. Now, I teach lessons and work with lower level dressage riders and hunter riders and I recommend this book to everyone. Regardless to your discipline, this should be required reading!"
3,What a crazy ride.,"This was some crazy trip. Overall I did enjoy this book, and it kept me reading and interested. I must say I was expecting something a little different, and it wasn't very scary, more like an R rated scooby doo. Just a run here, run there, don't go in there, don't do that to the point of overdoing it.I like Laymon, and I will read more, but I was just left with a feeling of ""what just happened"". Enjoy it for what it is...a fun read."
3,Just okay...,"Though i love Richard Laymons books this book was just okay for me. I found that it took a long time to get into. For almost the first half of the book i was bored and kept putting it down. The second half got better but still wasn't amazing. From the book description i assumed it would have been much better. My favorite book written by Richard Laymon has to be ""Island"". It was one of those books you cant put down and your dying to know what happens next throughout the whole book. Its extremely twisted though so if you dont think you can handle it, dont read it. If you like ""twisted"" I would definately recommend ""Island"" to you. I own it in paperback and on my kindle now."
4,one fo the best books i have ever read!!!,This is one of the best books i have ever read. I am a huge richard laymon fan. This book is very intersteing i couldnt put it down.
3,Annoying but I got thru it...,"This book had it's good parts and it's bad parts. I loved the whole troll under the bridge theme. When Laymon describes the scary flesh eating bums under the bridge it scared the bejesus out of me!!!! Other than that, it was ok. It kind of annoyed me with all the running around at night trying to find this mystery girl. Hiding in peoples houses, ride or hide.... I fell that Laymon could have explained a little more about ""Why"" all these crazies came out in October and maybe elaborated a little more with the crazies instead of following ""Casey"" around. He didn't even expalin ""Casey"" enough for me. I liked it, but it wasn't great!"
2,Juvenile Fantasies,"Go out late at night when only the weirdos are out. All the women in your life are sexually aggressive and can't get enough of you. Let's do it under the bridge where the cannibals live. Your biggest fear is homosexual rape.Too wordy, too far out to make you afraid."
3,Not up to Laymon's regular quality,"I'm a HUGE Richard Laymon fan. However, this book feels as if he just sat down and started writing without an outline or any idea of where it was headed. I only wish the rest of the book was as good as the last 50 pages. If you are a new reader, choose something else by Laymon to start with... like IN THE DARK or ISLAND. Don't get me wrong, this was still an enjoyable read, but not nearly his best."
1,Night in the Lonesome October,"Your product description is for a book by Roger Zelazny, which is what I thought I was buying, and instead I got a totally different book by Richard Laymon. It is immaterial whether it's good. It isn't the book represented and I didn't want it."
5,a compilation...excellent!,"This is a great collection of the b-sides from the Anima Animus album, with a couple of average remixes of Turn It On. This has all the b-sides from the out of print eraser cut e.p., including All She Could Ask For, which is worth the cost of the whole shebang - Sioux's lost, haunting vocals layered over menacing synths and Budgie's excellent drumming...who could ask for more?"
3,it's alright but Eraser cut will suffice,"When I picked this up I quickly realized that I could have saved myself the trouble since I already had Eraser Cut and the only tracks on here that are really all that great are the ones from there. The extras are okay but not all that . . .I think that Eraser Cut is hard to find now so, if you come across this one and you don't have THAT one, go ahead and snag it."
1,Casio Women's Illuminator digital watch,"Not very impressive...ended up buying the Baby G watch that cost 5 times more, but way cooler!"
2,unstylish and too small,"For the price, I got what I paid for, but it has no style and the numbers are too small, and the plastic band is annoying. It was my own fault for buying it. I got it because of the 12/24 time, for work. I don't recommend the watch but the service at Amazon is great and I would order from you again."
2,Crap Watch,"Its ok but the only problem is that fog is in the watch and I didnt dive 50 metres, i just washed my hands."
5,Best Comedy Musical Ever!!,"One of the worst travesties in London theatrical history occurred when this show closed after its short run at the Piccadilly Theatre Savaged by the critics (well most of them) but loved by the audiences this enthralling musical lampoon of Melvilles epic as staged by a ""St Trinians"" school clone never fails to please. From the opening ""Parents Day"" which explains the staging of the musical through the wonderful ""Forbidden Seas"", ""Gypsy Dancer"" and the fantastically vocal ""Man Happens"" the lyrics at times bring tears to you eyes for all the right reasons. The only regret is that all the visual gags and mock amateur staging that accompany the songs has been lost. Men playing schoolgirls playing sailors.... hmmm I can see why the snooty critics saw it as a soft target but 12 years on the legend endures. Hopefully Mr Mackintosh will have enough faith in his creation to restage it at some point in the future and until then we at least have a fitting memorial in this recording."
4,A Whale Of A Tale,"I am a collector of musicals on CD, and like to find unusual items. To say this is unusual is an understatement. Think St Trinians in a school play, and you've got the basic plot. It is a very funny musical, although if just the Moby Dick story was kept and changes made, it could stand as a serious show."
5,The best modern dance,"These 3 lively pieces represent the Mediterranean sea, the nature and the Spanish culture. Nacho Duato is a very talented choreographer. The dancer's movements are full and the music is lyrical."
1,Broken blower wheel on first use... no parts or service,"The very first time I used the gun... it worked fine... or until I picked it up to use a second time. The blower motor just whirred. The plastic blower wheel had broken loose from the motor shaft. Okay, s*#% happens... but I haven't been able to order a part or find any service center that would take the repair. Basically, this is a useless heat gun. I've made three telephone calls to McCulloch with NOT ONE return phone call or email. Amazon was equally useless... they advised me to contact McCulloch! Save your money... buy a heat gun from Milwaukee!!!!"
2,One of the most uninteresting readings of the Eroica to have come my way in a long time,"Potential buyers, despite the cheap prices, beware: this is one of the most unintersting readings of Beethoven's Eroica to have come my way in a long time. See my review ofSymphony 3. Sorry I can't comment on Ormandy's Wellington, it is the other CD that I have, which has only Leinsdorf's Eroica."
1,Do Not Buy,"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to exploit other artists that are more successful than him. I doubt anyone besides Martin Atkins has seen a penny from Pigface sales, do not buy anything from this guy, he is not worthy of your hard earned money."
1,"Creative, but not in a good way","This record is one of the most creative efforts I have ever listened to. Unfortunately, it loses itself in being strange. Compiling several different singers and songwriters, this album has potential. However, the songs last much too long and never go anywhere - they just loop endlessly. Some songs are just drums (and synthesized ones at that!). This one is only for those who are fed up with mainstream and need something completely different. Even they will still be disappointed, though."
2,Pretty light,"This was interesting, but poorly written (or, translated?) and light in terms of backing up the thesis with concrete examples. I came away unconvinced, but intrigued."
3,REPAIR MANUAL,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK . IT SHOWS IN DETAIL WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO TO GET THE JOB DONE. VERY GOOD PRICE.
5,A Powerful Resource for Christians Everywhere!,"In every respect, Dictionary of the Later New Testament is a magnificent achievement in the study of early Christianity. It is both authoritative and scholarly and takes the study of early New Testament literature to a new level. I found the articles on Hebrews and Acts to be especially well written and helpful, and the book's thorough coverage of other non-canonical early church literature was refreshing. Take my word, Dictionary of the Later New Testament is a ""must have"" for any serious student of the Bible. I guarantee, it won't just ""sit"" on your bookshelf, but rather, it will become one of your most trusted resources!"
3,Packed with great scifi imagination,"This novel is what I would call RICH. What an imagination! Lots to think about in terms of scifi. But the story was so-so though and then ending just sort of petered out. The story had too much to do with demonology and christian mythology to be very interested to a nonbeliever like me. If it wasn't for the great scifi ideas I would have put the book down after not many pages of reading. As it was, it was difficult to read the novel for long because of it being so rich with thought provoking ideas and also because I was not really caught up in the story."
1,Placed an order but never received book,"Although this is not really a review, I could not find any way to express it through. I filled the order form with an American Express payment order in June. They said I would get the dictionary in august. Since this month is about to end and I have not been charged the value nor the book delivered I reviewed my account but according to Amazon I have no order placed nor delivery pending.I'm afraid to place the order again since the old order may show up and I would be charged twice. Amazon should have a place for this kind of problem."
2,Uncertain time keeping,"I was anxious to receive this watch, as I was making a trip across the international date line. I was disappointed, as day after day it lost several minutes before I even left home. Each time it required several minutes of button pushing before it would re-synch, and even then it had to ""see the sky"" to synch. Once on my trip, it changed by about an hour and a half, and I nearly missed a plane. It went to the bottom of my suitcase for the rest of my trip, and I've asked for a refund."
2,Where's the beep?,"I too got one of these on Woot and mine does not receive the much vaunted radio signal to sync with the exact official time either...maybe Woot was saddled with defective units that have nothing to do with what Amazon has to offer, but you'd think that Fossil, no discount brand they, would produce a better product and police the distribution of clunkers."
3,Coiuld Use more Info on Watch,Needs an index in the instruction book listing the name of the city for the 3 letter code displayed. And a listing showing what batteries are used.
3,Abacus Atomic Watch,"The watch is a little larger and heavier than I had expected. It updates as advertised, but I was disappointed to find that I still have to select the time zones manually. I have been using a watch that has world times and been switching the zones manually for 20 years. I thought this watch would not only update timne, but automaticlly switch zones according to where you are in the world using the updaing systems around the world like my electric clocks at home. I do like the larger numbers, but the alarm is barely loud enough to hear and probably won't be loud enough to wake you up from sleeping."
2,Too Heavy & Too Big,"Be aware - this watch weighs 156 gms (5.5 oz) which is approximately double what most watches weigh. The watch body itself is equally large and awkward. Perhaps the watch needs to be that large to house all the electronics to receive the time radio signal.I will have to take the word of the previous reviewer that the watch does not set the time zone as other atomic clocks do by using the radio signal, because my watch has yet to successfully receive a radio signal. It is currently off by 6 minutes and losing a few seconds every day.I would return it, but I got it on woot (for $24.99). Perhaps this will make a good emergency gift for someone I do not like very much. :)"
4,Good Product,"Although a bit expensive, a good product. Holds in humid weather without becoming sticky or gummy."
3,Tough it was softer,bought it thinkin it was a softer model but it wasn't. it's was still good for the money.
1,generic sound,"I'd heard a lot of good things about the music of Tim Berne, so I was excited when I received this as a gift. However, I was very disappointed and didn't find anything innovative, fresh, exciting, or even interesting in it at all. Most amateur jazz has a lot more energy and talent than what this CD contains. The music just kind of fades in the background with some occasional outbursts which are more cacophonous than anything else. Most songs just contain a generic sound of brass and Sorry, but I simply can't recommend this unless you're looking for elevator music."
5,Beyond a Doubt My Favorite!,"I am not a music scholar. I am not a musician. I am not a critic. What I am is a lover of music and especially of powerful and emotive music. I listen to music not to analyze but to FEEL! I fell in love with the Carmina Burana while in college many years ago. I have searched long and hard for ANY version that captures the raw energy and powerful emotions of the bookending piece, ""O, Fortuna"", as well as on this recording and have found none that meet the mark. The employment and use of a thunderous gong, performed with a flair unlike any other recording that I know of is worth the price of the CD in and of itself! If you as a listener wish to buy a recording of the Carmina Burana for analytical purposes, then I haven't a clue which version to purchase. However, if your aim is to to FEEL, to EXPERIENCE, to be ABSORBED by the Carmina, then look no further. This is the one. The ONLY one!"
5,The Best Carmina Burana recording,"I have attended concerts, owned vinyls, owned taped versions and have this CD. This CD is so good that I bought another copy to give to our neighbors who had just attended a local concert of the piece.The recording quality is excellent, the voices superb. I particularly enjoy the energy of the pieces. The spectral frequency range is excellent, although the volume range is too large with quiet pieces being to quiet and loud sections being overly loud. I fear this just the technical difficulty of recording such a large assembly of musicians the way the hearer perceives it.I recommend this to anyone and everyone who admires Orff's work."
3,Off-Orff,"3 1/2There is a reason the powerful theme sandwiched between this opera sticks out like a sore thumb. Even with beguiling vocal work and at least some impressive composition, much of what lies in between does not burrow into memory nearly as much."
1,Pathetic and pasteurized...,"In the classical world there are great conductors: Toscanini, Solti, Karajan, Kondrashin, Boulez, Levine, Furtwangler, Klemperer, Rozhdestvensky, Previn, Ozawa, etc. There are also poor conductors, among which Fiedler and Slatkin spring instantly to mind.Leonard Slatkin is characteristically anemic in this outing. This fatuous release, cursed by facility, only serves to undermine composers as gifted as Orff. John Aler and the St Louis Orchestra are brilliant performers, and not served well by this outing. Even the cover [bites]. Avoid this dreck at all costs... CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,ROBIN GIBB HAS A VOICE FILLED WITH PASSION.,THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL AND VERY MOVING SONG. YOU CAN'T HELP THE TEARS AS YOU LISTEN TO THIS SONG.
3,Has potential.,"This band has potential. Some of the tracks on this album have it all; they are unconventional, and use electronic beats in a truly soulful way. The singer ties it together with an extremely laid back singing style, which is best described as smooooothhh. The only problem here is that some of the songs start to feel overly laid back at times. The result is that parts of this album take on an air of mediocrity and even impotence. The best song is the second one. After listening to this whole album several times, however, I have found it really difficult to get through the whole thing."
4,affinity for britpop,"When I first heard this album I though it was a British band I hadn't yet come across- It sounds a little like the moodiest bits of 1995-97 Blur if they were in Sweden more often. Its very addictive, well crafted pop. If you like Pulp, Blur, Stereolab, that sort of beat I'd add this one to your collection too. And Vice Versa, for your Sea & Cake fans. It also makes me want to buy lots of Bruuns Bazaar clothes and eat Scandinavian food. Maybe do some shopping. But that's just me."
2,Overpriced little book,11.95 is much too much for a 45 page book with very big font size and cartoonish pictures. OK for posture work at the office but really nothing new or even interesting in this book. A pamphlet would contain as much info.
1,Masters of Chant Chapter III DVD is unplayable in USA,"The regional code is 2USA is 1Therefore North Americans should not purchaseAmazon refunded purchase without problem, but should not offer DVDs without knowledge of their regional code."
1,Slutty,"This Nolee doll is slutty. She is ugly too....... I am never going to get this ugly and slutty doll. I am going to get a beautiful and pretty Bratz doll. You should too if you want to have a fun life. And they are prettier and better anyways, and my Scene dolls suck."
2,Info isn't new or unique,"Most of the information in the book is available on the internet. I would have liked a better explanation of how lighting and brilliance work, rather than a ""Buy my opal brilliance kit"" ad."
3,Opal cutting basics,"A nice book but half of it is not really about opal cutting - 40% is padded out with stone setting, a skill the author admits he is limited in, this is the second in the two titles of a similar name and has a fair mount of waffle, its got some good bits but certainly not as good as I would have hoped for.The two books should have been combined into one, the author seems to have padded the subject out into two books."
5,Beautiful!,For years I have admired Botts' work. What a special pleasure when an artist is foremost a Christian! You can feel certain that anything you get by Botts will be pleasing - in every respect.
5,Just Beautiful!,"Always use Timothy Botts for gifts....what a beautiful way to read the word!Second time I bought this for a friend...their house burnt down, so this is a replacement copy!"
3,A Mediocre CD,This CD has a good Latin beat. It is something new and kind of funky. Some of the tracks are a little lame. I would recommend buying this CD if you want something different.
1,flashlight,Do not bother with this purchase. It did not work right from the package.move on to something from your local big box store.
4,Review of Lantolf,"The main force behind Lantolf's book is to broaden the base of theories for second language acquisition (SLA). A major theme running through the text is the inadequacy of popular interactionist theories of SLA for explaining and describing language development, and the need for a research framework that accounts for the role of social context and collaborative dialogue. The text starts with a good overview of sociocultural theory, outlining the major aspects of the theory, including activity theory, inner/private speech and the zone of proximal development. The relevance of these areas are then discussed by a number of SLA theorists/researchers, with the aim of calling for a deeper, contextual and qualitative analysis of language learning interactions/tasks, and asserting the efficacy of sociocultural theory in facilitating and explaining effective language learning. A very readable book."
2,Unbelievable!,"I can't believe this things has gotten ANY good reviews.Okay, it's a decently made video, alright presentation, easy to pick up on the licks, the on-screen tablature is great...BUT I never got past Misirlou (the first song on the tape) because... it's not Misirlou. The video instructs you to play the song in the wrong SCALE. If you listen to a Dick Dale recording of this song and then watch the tape, you will laugh yourself off your stool.It's wrong. You can find a tab transcription book with this song and see for yourself that it's wrong.[opening lick actual notes: bottom string 0,1,4,5,7,8,11,8,7 and on the video: 0,3,4,5,7,10,11,8]Waste of ten bucks."
5,Great Video!,"I've been trying to find ANYTHING that had some of the great surf tunes that locals here in San Diego were famous for playing...Dick Dale and the Beach Boys (Both great surf bands that have visited, and I've seen in concert) are some classic surf tunes. This video started out with one of the more difficult songs I've learned, Miserlou, but moving onto easier songs that I've heard and remembered. Pipeline I've picked up easily, and love it! This video was EASY to learn, and helped me along quickly. A MUST buy if you want to learn good picking techniques, and surf music!"
4,Fun and educational,"I really enjoyed ""A Flight of Green Parrots"" for it was both educational and entertaining. I especially enjoyed the character development. I found that I was unable to put it down until it was finished. I also enjoyed the historic references. I hope to see more work from Dipak Basu."
4,"a gripping, entertaining read","An easy, gripping read which provides a believable flavor of India in colonial times. Has many of the ingredients which grabs the reader's attention - adventure, drama, history and romance, all of which are in poetic prose. Almost sets the reader up for a sequel."
4,A Historical Romance that is a Page Turner,"I loved this book. The characters are vivid -- though most are either completely good or completely bad--an aspect of romance novels. But the story is riveting. I could not put it down once I started, and I learned a great deal about this historical moment. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the complex and compelling country of India. It made me want to go there and see the layers of history and its complex religious and ethnic facets. I am looking for the next book by this author."
1,Most of the reviews on here are from friends of the author,"The book is OK, the photos, are OK, although they are mostly of ""modified"" penises, and the book is more like a bunch of essays/articles with photos stuck in between. Also, before buying the book, know that most of the positive reviews are from either friends/business associates or members of the author's website, so they are undoubtedly at least somewhat biased. It's not the worst book on the subject of body modification, but then again, there aren't really any that are all that good."
2,"High hopes, grounded.","This book had a lot of potential, but was poorly executed. The book description boasts ""containing comprehensive and informative information on the subject,"" but it's lacking severely in this area. I suppose I purchased this book in hopes that I would find a condensed version of some of BMEZine's articles, which are well thought out and full of information. This book read like a series of poorly pulled together magazine articles and often times, the photos occupying the articles were either misleading, misplaced or lacking any further explanation. What also disappointed me, and someone has touched on this before, any person who identifies themselves as a member of the ""body modification community"" can easily point out many of subjects in this book. These people are already well publicized and very vocal. Although they are extremely interesting, they no longer command my attention. This book was a letdown."
2,Don't like it!,"I thought the book would be full of color images: yes, it is full of images, but they're black and white and the images aren't so good. Besides, there's no longer studies about it, the book only show famous people on body-mod and their interviews. I think they have an extraordinary material to do a great book."
5,"Found by accident, loved and cherished.","It was looking for pictures of owls that I found one of Marry Oliver's poems. I was struck by the imagery she portrays and by the mouth-dropping metaphors and almost seamless way of making you flow with the read.She has particularly two details that I appreciate very much from her writing.1.) She plays vividly with light and darkness, creating an assorted array of contrasts that lets you intake the imagery as if you were there, watching what she did when she was struck by the arrow of poetic thinking.2.) She has this most assuring way of dealing with death; death doesn't seem to bother her nor does it seem to be regarded as right and wrong, it simply is--like the keeper of life and the taker of it, too. She admires how death takes what it must but respects what life must keep in order to maintain balance. I think it's this particular characteristic that especially calls upon my attention and that lures me to keep on reading her writings."
2,don't care for,I don't care for the camera. A lot of the pictures are blurry. Could be the operator but I don't think so. I would think the stablizer would take care of that problem.The manual needs to be simpilfied. Very confusing have to kept turning pages to get to one item. Would not recommend
5,GREAT CAMERA !!!!!!,"I am a novice photographer at best, and this camera makes it easy. The controls are easy to use and well thought out, and I think the picture quality is second to none."
4,"5 stars for value, 4 stars for performance","The best value in a big zoom digicam IMHO. This camera offers all the controls you would ever need to take awesome pictures yet is very easy to use. Very good battery life, Good lenses. At higher ISO it is a bit noisy, Stay under ISO 400.Also worth mentioning is that this is the only digicam that offer RAW mode along with JPEG."
2,BLURRY PHOTOS INDOORS.,"I borrowed my friend's Panasonic FZ8 this past weekend to photograph my son's birthday party. I took about 150 photos total. I took all photos on Manual mode. Finding a photo that is sharp is a actually challenge! I ended up deleting 90% of the photos after uploading them to the computer. So, if you take lots of photos indoors where a flash is usually needed, keep on shopping. After taking dozens of photos indoors, I went outside to test the camera under bright sunlight. Horrible. photos were overexposed. I wouldn't want a free FZ8, let alone buy one."
3,didn't love it,the no flash photos were sooooo yellow and pixelated.In general the color quality was poor.
3,"Great Camera, Panasonic, not so great","I have used this camera on 2 trips and with fantastic results. The only thing about which I would warn potential buyers is that, somewhere along the way we lost our battery charger and replacing it has been a nightmare. The Panasonic web site is less-than-helpful unless you have the serial number of the part you need which is obviously impossible when you lose it. Amazon doesn't sell the charger, they can sell you a new battery however (???). Panasonic finally said they could send us another charger after we got them on the phone (not easy) and it would be $35. which seems outrageous given that other Lumix replacement chargers seem to be about $10.I could kick myself for losing the charger so I admit it's my own fault but this seem unduly difficult and expensive."
3,Not received,"I haven't receive the product because I live out of the states, it's not a Amazon problem, article was received on time in my states address."
4,"better than point and shoot, but it aint no DSLR","I wanted a camera with decent zoom and more manual control over most point and shoot so I can use this to take pictures of my tomica cars to make a gallery, and also occasional pictures of my dog in action. Menu, controls are very easy to operate. The camera size is right between a DSLR and point and shoot. The grip and LCD are excellent. The camera is a bargain at this price, but make no mistake it is not dSLR. Battery life is ok. Would prefer rechargable AA than proprietary lithium, but i dont travel much."
4,Large but love it...,"This camera is large if you are used to the little qute digitals that slip into a shirt pocket or a small purse. I like a camera that feels more substantial and this one does. Great zoom and very versital adjustments. Good stabilization too. I have used it often already and have no complaints. Battery life seems to be great. One thing though, you will have to get an SD card or a gig or more as 7.1 megs is alot of resolution. The built in memory only nets you 4 to six pictures at full 7.1"
4,Very good value,I have been using this camera for about 2 months. I consider myself an average amateur photographer. I've been very happy with the camera. I've used about every feature on the camera and have relied very little on the manual. I have mostly just played around with various settings and can now shoot photos effectively in just about every environment. If you're looking for a sub $300 camera with loads of features and good quality photos -- this may just be the camera for you.
5,X,"My second Panasonic digital camera. I purchased it partly for the Leica lens system, and I have found it to be beautifully engineered by Panasonic in every respect."
5,Cheap and best,"This is a great camera!! Easy to use, complete in functionality, great performance, very good results. Nearly unbelievable low light performance even completely zoomed in and crazy-slow shutter speeds. Good manual control. Fast shutter response and repeat picture. Video feature allows one to create a ""Harry Potter"" photo album - the photos of your friends waving at you. Has RAW format function. The only thing that would improve this camera would be if it had a flip-out and rotate screen for shooting over one's head in a crowd or down in the dirt for those low-angle shots."
3,NOT good for movies,The picture quality is good. But the moviemode wouldn't let you change the zoom or the focus:zoom and focus are fixed from the first frame you compose.
4,Purchase of Panasonic Lumix DMC-FC8S Digital Camera,I was very impressed with the quality of the purchase process. You provided good reviews of the available products. The camera itself is quite good and all I expected it to be.I will definitely go through Amazon again for my purchases!Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)
4,"Loaded With Features, But....","What happened to the price? I bought mine about two years ago for a little more than two hundred dollars! Maybe it's the ""K"" designation following the FZ8. Still, if one's going to buy this camera, it's loaded with great features. The stablization feature works very well and the camera's zoom is breathtaking.The CONS of this camera include a very inaccurate white setting that makes using it on ""auto"" risky. Also, despite its zoom capability, I find that wide angle capability is far more useful than telescopic! Most digital cameras have distortion in both wide angle and telephoto, but the Panasonic comes with software that can help correct it.For $225, this camera would be just about right. For over five hundred, take a hike and find something else!"
5,Awesome Camera,"My husband is tired of hearing about how much I love this camera. It does everything I ever wanted in a camera. My boys are both in sports and the action shots are amazing. It can blur a little after dark sometimes but in daylight, I haven't had any blurred shots no matter how fast the subject is moving."
4,"great camera, very pleased","I'm very pleased with this camera :)prosit's very light and small, but well builtthe lecia lens is awsome and the 12x zoom is perfectvideo quailty is goodmacro setting is greatauto focus is greatall the settings and options work welleasy to understand and use menuquick start upimage quality is generally superbflash works greatnearly perfect veiwfinderLCD is crisp and clearaffordableconsnot so great photos at ISO 200+the flash is set to forced off (all you have to do is pop it up and change it to forced on, no biggie)action shots? still figuring out how to take them well with this cameraI've had it for about a week and so far Im loving it more and moreI havent had any problems and it's a great upgrade from my standard 4mp kodakI'm still learning how otu se all the settings and all the tricks, the manual is very helpfulI highly reccomend this if you're not quite ready for an SLR, but want more options than a standard point and shoot"
4,Using product,With the right photo processing program this makes ensuring the correct colors of your digital images a breeze. It works especially well when photographing your art work or items for Ebay for which the colors are very important. Correcting the colors is a matter of a few clicks.
1,Bolt Holes Too Small,"Had to return carrier because the bolt holes in the adjustable bracket were stamped out for a 1/4"" bolt instead of the required 5/16"" bolt. Manufacturer couldn't exchange it because they are sold exclusively through Amazon."
3,Certainly not the best Oracle around.....,"I gave this 'oracle' three stars based upon the beautiful artwork alone.If you are looking for a Goddess based Oracle, I recommend trying your hand at the The Goddess Tarot. (A bit more complicated if you are not used to reading tarot, but much more accurate and way more artistically moving!)This is the kind of gift you give someone whom already has everything under the sun......or for any tarot/oracle collector. Recommended under certain circumstances."
2,Exercise bands,All I can say is you get what you pay for and you pay with pain. These are cheaply made and I broke one after light use for a week and a half. If you're serious about using bands look somewhere else.
2,Gross out warning,Skip chapter one if you do not wish to see in explicit detail one man urinating on another. I found this to be extremely disgusting. You have been warned. I am surprised none of the other reviewers mentioned this.
5,"Smart, funny and stylish - a great intro to foreign films","'Ridicule' is a wonderful French film I rented and have enjoyed time and time again, even with some friends who hate films that they have to ""read."" If you dislike foreign films or films with captions, you're missing out if you haven't seen ""Ridicule."" Lavish costumes, great sets, and the attention paid to detail regarding the period are all incredible. Enjoy this sexy and intelligent romp through the bedrooms, the social politics, and the court of pre-revolutionary France where verbal reparte could make or break one's social standing. A definite thumbs up."
2,It is a Brick,"The travel size is perfect for me. This type of pillow may work well for others, but not for me. I was so excited to try out my new pillow. I was looking forward to the soft shushing sound as the hulls conformed to my head filling in to the areas needing support. Tired, very much in need of restful sleep I lay my weary head onto a BRICK. I got up and removed hulls per the instructions. I carefully saved the hulls. Two nights later after removing literally a gallon of hulls the pillow was more managable or so I thought. The pillow now shushes nicely. Again I lay my weary head down fully expecting it to conform to my head. I was sadly disappointed to find my pillow is still a brick. I will not recommend the buckwheat pillow to anyone."
5,Fantastic!!!!,A great DVD set. Each episode is excellent TV at it's very best. It's too bad they can't make television shows THIS GOOD today. SWAT is TV at it's best.
5,Some Clarification,"Here's something that I wanted to know but couldn't find the answers anywhere, so here are the answers.1. The episodes ""The Deadly Tide (Parts 1 and 2)"" and ""The Running Man (Parts 1 and 2)"" are presented here as feature-length movies, just as they were originally aired, not split into 2 seperate episodes as most of us remember them in syndication.2. The episode ""Time Bomb"", which was produced for season 1 but not aired until season 2, and which was included on the season 1 dvd, is NOT presented again on this set.As far as I'm concerned, these were both the right answers. Whatever your preferences, I hope this information is useful. Enjoy!"
3,only 12 shimmies,"I agree with another reviewer that this DVD is very disappointing. Is it another money-making idea for the BDSS? There are only 12 shimmies demonstrated here: 1 shoulder shimmy and 11 hip shimmies including a ""freeze"", haggalla, twist, Egyptian, etc. Bozenka's shimmies are amazing but she does not explain how to develop the technique, she only shows each one for less than a minute, maybe she fears competitors.Instead of this DVD I would recommend Leila Jouvana's 1001 shimmies which is much more complete and detailed. After all Leila is the ""shimmy queen""!"
4,love to shimmy,"I am an intermediate bellydancer as well as an intermediate/advanced ballroom dancer. I like the format and the pleasant way Bozenka instructs the different shimmies, some which are completely new for me. It also helps to review the more common shimmies. This has something for all levels and I find it a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I am pleased with this DVD. Even the length makes it easy to do from start to finish leaving one with a feeling of accomplishment after each practice. Excellent buy for the discount price of $8.99 from Amazon.I will be buying the 21 shimmies at some point as well since it does cover much more. It is also much more expensive, about $34.00, so that will have to wait a little longer. That is why I started with this one."
1,I want more from Bozenka!,"It's difficult for me to review this DVD because it seemed like very little effort went into the making. Bozenka's an amazing dancer and a gifted instructor so why this did not translate into her video doesn't make sense. The DVD would fit the advance beginner level; unfortunately, if you've had more than a year of dance instruction, you might feel cheated by the slim amount of instructional material. I would only recommend this video if you're the kind of dancer who sometimes feels lazy and you'd like to follow along without putting a lot of mental effort. As long as you're very familiar with your shimmies, you could use it for this method. I know some dancers do this at home. Still, I'd go hunting for another video before popping this one into my DVD player. BDSS should be producing better videos."
1,Disappointing !,"I was not too happy with this DVD. Everything about was too rapid and hurried, even the warm-up. The shimmy sequences could have been longer and more fluid. This DVD is by far inferior to the other Bellydance DVD'S. Shame on you Bozenka ! You did not do your homework when making a DVD ! You should have studied Neon or Joyce to see what a great bellydance DVD contains."
3,50 years of thr U-2,"The aircraft story is VERY exhaustive, but lack 3views, cutaway and summary of technical data. No comparative profiles at all."
3,Interesting read..,"I picked up this book on a whim, having already read the 4 books written by Dan Brown, thinking it would be a fun way to spend a few hours. Rogak does a fine job of describing the life and work of Dan Brown and keeps things moving, not unlike the writing style of Brown himself.While Brown is not the most interesting guy on the planet, I enjoyed reading this book as much for her details of the writing process from an author's viewpoint as I did to learn about America's currently most popular writer. Overall Id recommend it to anyone with a Da Vinci Code fascination or up-and-coming authors."
1,"Very flimsy, poor design.","I have a Top Flite 20-ft telescoping flagpole that I've had for close to two years. I've had problems with most everything, the spring loaded pins that hold each section extended, and the clear plastic collars that sit atop each section. The spring loaded pins that freeze from retracting, or will not extend; these have contributed to numerous uncommanded collapses of one or two sections causing damage to the pin mechanism and elongating the holes that the pins extend through. The clear plastic collars have set pins that you tighten with an Allen wrench. The plastic is so fragile that it is next to impossible to avoid breaking them. I've gotten my flagpole back up, but I had to improvise. I bought 3 hose clamps from the hardware store and installed them just above the plastic collars. Think seriously, with the constant failures and maintenance, I would never buy one of these again."
3,Historical fiction!,"This story takes place in l858 and involves much to the leading up to of the Civil war, it jumps back and forth between so many characters, the leading person of the story ""Nathanial Barrington"" is a drunk in an unhappy marriage that had previously served in the U.S. Army in New Mexico but had since resigned his commission to return to New York City but being unhappy there decides to return to the frontier as the assistant indian commissioner to assist the murderous Apache indian tribes of the area(southeastern New Mexico), there is much about Kansas striving for statehood with the slavery problem muddling the issue, Robert E. Lee is briefly in the story as well as U.S. Grant pawning a watch in a pawn shop in St. Louis, I suspect that the author is a frustrated history teacher, this is one of 5 books being labeled a ""trilogy"", someone apparently got carried away trilogizing, think I will skip the rest of the series:-(."
1,"overworked plot, poor quality photography, dull comedy","couple gets cash from gangsters and run off trying toescape gangsters in pursuit. Dull humor - bordering onthree stooges hitting over head with shovels, but withless appeal. There is no meaningful character development."
4,worth checking out,"I really wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this film, but the box cover was so excellant that I had to check it out. This is the first independent japaneese film that I've ever watched and I really liked it. Everything about the film is original from the writing, plot, characters, directing. The great thing about ""adrenaline drive"" is that you don't need to be japaneese to appreiciate it. The characters are very likable and you care what happens to them. Excellent film, worth renting or adding to your dvd collection."
4,Quirky engaging comic drama,I first saw this at a Japanese film festival and after this I bought the DVD. It has some great characters. If you enjoy real characters (not fake Hollywood ones). Just try and leave your mainstream conditioning at the door.
3,Buy 50th anniversary collection instead,"The one really good song not on '50th' that's here is 'railroad song' ('country girl' is also pretty good) but '50th' gives you 'king's song', 'vespers', 'spin,...' 'cigarettes...' 'salon and saloon'. The others found here but not on '50th', 'circle of style' 'carnival of pride' 'wear out the turnpike' and 'can't wait' certainly aren't his best (early duets with his wife). So that comparison favors '50th'. The track order on '50th' is also chonological whereas this one isn't and frankly makes no sense at all, so if you buy this you won't get to hear the evolution of this unique music--something very apparent on '50th' and interesting to hear.'Railroads and Riverboats', another superb American History song, keeps getting left off compliations. No different here or on '50th'. But both that one and railroad song are on 'Facets', which--save the songs I mentioned--is a bit of a waste."
3,The Great Jim Croce,"This compilation collects most of the songs from his last three studio albums with the exception of ""It doesn't have to be that way"", and ""Salon and Saloon."" These songs play in no particular order with earlier songs sprinkled in between. It's not clear from the liner notes if some of these songs were intended for an upcoming album before Jim died. It would be cool to find a lost Gem. I prefer to buy the original albums and make my own compilations."
5,Gunga Din,"Hey to everyone!I'm from Germany.My dad loves this man and in two weeks its his birthday. He has several CD`s ""Love songs"", ""Down the highway"",""Photographs and Memories"" and so on...but there is one title he only got it on Lp: Gunga Din.He got ""The faces I've been"" and I know that this song is also on the Lp ""Facets"", but I coudln`t find it on CD. It`s such very big wish by my dad and I would be so happy if someone can tell me where I can buy it or actually if it does exist.Thank u, hopefully till then...!!"
3,Not for the very young,I got this book for my 4 1/2 year old. The book is well done and the reading was great. The story line includes a part about Rumplestilskin taking the woman's baby away. That really scared my daughter and was a fear I didn't need her to be exposed to yet. Lesson learned_ read everything before giving the book to her.
2,blimps as military tools,"I'm interested in blimps because I want to know why they are so easily destroyed. Also, they seem inefficient: why all that space just to carry so little? This work didn't really touch upon my questions. This work details why the blimp was useful to Germans, Brits, and Americans in times of war. This felt like any other History Channel documentary. There's much focus on the 1910s and 1940s. It does mention Alberto Santos-Dumas, a figure about whom I want to learn more and about whom I encourage others to do the same. To me, this work was dull, but I'm sure it will have an audience who would just love, love, love it. The successes and failures of the blimp mirror the successes and failures of space travel. Viewers may find the work more interesting if they try to connect the discussion to more recent matters."
2,A Bayou Classic Fail,"I have purchased many Bayou Classic products. Fish fryers, burners, and utensils. This is by far my most disappointing purchase yet. The mesh is patched together in the middle creating sharp pointed wires sticking out in several places. Purchase this item in a store so you can do a quality inspection for yourself since they don't seem to care about the quality of of this item."
5,Not quite the intended use- fireplace coal scoop.,I needed a coal scoop to help me sift hot coals from ash- and this has worked wonderfully. So long as I don't pull huge logs with it I can push a pile of ash backwards and let the coals fall forward.The scoop has held up since November (It is January now) in very hot fires. If it holds up there I bet it'll hold up under your frying.
3,(Highlights from) A rather different Messiah,"Regrettably, someone has scanned the back cover instead of the front of the CD; if they had done the front (a pox on those silly RCA jewel-cases) they would have shown that it is a selection of highlights from Sir Thomas Beecham's famous Royal Philharmonic performance of the Messiah.In stark contrast to the present-day tradition of performing this work with a fairly typical baroque orchestra (small-around 30 players and anything from just 4 to maybe 15 voices) or a baroque festival orchestra (a little larger?), this lushly re-orchestrated sumptuous-sounding performance is one of the best of the genre.At a modest price, this recording has much to offer, and I wouldn't trade my copy for anything. ""I know that my redeemer Liveth"" is almost painfully romantic, and there are other little gems, as well as suprising little disappointments. It is generally beautifully performed, with practically no rough spots.Archimedes"
5,"Not what I'd call ""Dynamic"" but it's still my favorite","Not to parrot the other reviewers, but the use of the word ""Dynamic"" in the title could definitely confuse some folks. However! This is still my favorite tape and I own quite a few. I enjoy the slow, relaxed pace and the gentle movements. I don't do yoga to work up a sweat, but make no mistake, you'll probably feel the effects of this session the next day or so. My only real criticism of this tape is Stephen Cope's use of proper hindu terms without explaining them, and the length. I don't usually have 1-1/2 hours to spend on yoga, but when I do - I enjoy the total body stretch the whole tape provides. I'd like to try the ""Gentle"" tape, but I can't imagine anything more gentle than this one. In summary, if you'd like a gentle whole body yoga-stretching tape - this is a good one to buy."
3,I agree with the June reviewer,"My feelings are very much the same as the previous reviewer. I'd purchased the ""gentle"" video first and loved it so much that I couldn't wait to buy ""dynamic."" However, I was very disappointed.This is a long, slow video to the point of becoming boring. The last two times I've attemted to use the tape, I couldn't complete it out of boredom.I also have used Bryan Kest's Videos, but alternate with Kripalu Gentle.If you are on a budget, don't spend your hard earned $$ on the dynamic tape."
4,Great pictures!,"This is a very good book in terms of introducing the different holidays/postcard themes that can be found. It has really great pictures and I guess what I take away most is the general ideas on what is considered valuable/rare. I just collect ones I like and think are attractive, I don't really collect because of the collectability, so this book was helpful for me in getting ideas on what else I might like and should look for."
2,Just OK,Really the only thing that was good about this one was that it was in color. I ordered another one which was much better but it was not in color which took away from it. Not recommended.
4,Beautiful book,I purchased this book used. When I received it was in WONDERFUL condition and I just love the illustrations. I do have one problem with this book--it is falling away from the spine! I haven't handled it roughly so I think the problem is the shape of the book and the pages are so heavy.
2,Biostatistics,Bought this for my first statistics class. Don't like the way the book was written. The information was very hard to understand. Examples were extremely difficult to follow.
4,Perfectly Fine and shipped in Time......vey happy,"Got my book as promised in two days.and that was most helpful for studying and obviously in perfect brand new condition, with the CD...Thanks Amazon..."
3,Alright,"The book was a little worse for wear than I expected. However, it was bearable and it did arrive soon (a little over a week)."
1,Poor layout,"I was assigned this text for my biostatistics class. Unfortunately, it is a poorly designed textbook, as everything is 'backwards'. Rosner gives examples before he introduces the material; he derives formulas before giving the real equation to use.The only good thing about the text are the summaries included on the CD-rom. I have decided to read these instead of the actual text, because they are straightforward and leave out extraneous material."
2,Better books available,"I was in a sense forced to purchase this text as it was the official text for my class. Unfortunately, if you are a researcher just trying to obtain a basic understanding of the field of statistics, this is not the book for you. There is very little that is understandable to a beginner or even to someone with some basic knowledge in the field. This book is purely meant for the statistican. Norman and Streiner's text on biostatistics and Andy Field's text on Statistics and SPSS are written in plain language. They are easy to understand and get the concepts across with only the bare minimum of formulas thrown around. This book's primary usefulness is its comprehensiveness, but that only goes so far when the text is just unintelligible to most of us mere mortals."
2,Waste of my money,"I too had to purchase this as the official text for my course. I found it very difficult to follow concepts in this book and I had just finished a college intro to statistics course. In the end, I had to rely completely on my professor's explanations."
2,Applied Stat,"The case studies are interesting and has a wealth of data sets. However for teaching the examples are poorly written, often convoluted and largely useless for learning. Often the text is along the lines of assume X = xxxx, Y = xxxx, thus the answer is . With little to no explanation short of the generic formula/law/axiom. As well as one, at best two, said examples.Another flaw is the horrible lack of solutions to problems contained in the book. Only about a third of the end of chapter problems have a solution in the book/cd, and it is just the solution with zero info on how it is obtained."
3,Cheaply made,Plastic and metal has burrs. Brush bristles are fanned out and bent. The tools work fine they just don't look very good.
5,A favorite book!,"I don't know what it is about this book that so captivated my 3 and 4 year old daughters, but after checking this book out at the library during Halloween season and then having my kids still talk about this book near Valentine's Day, I bought it for them as a Valentine's gift. The main reason I had to purchase it was because in February, all 4 copies that the library had were already checked out and there was a waiting list! This says a lot about the popularity of this little book about a witch whose goblin friends help her make pumpkin pie. This book is a definite hit with pre-schoolers!"
5,Drat!,"Big Pumpkin with the audio tape/cd is probably one of my Top 5 stories for children. The audio narration/song for this story is catchy, captivating and full of character. Our staff loves it, the students love it, my granddaughter loves it, I love it.....it's a winner all the way around!! It has become a Halloween tradition. It's unfortunate that the book is only published now without the great audio, and you have to pay lots of money to get a privately marketed copy."
4,Repetitive nature is excellent for beginnig reading.,This book is read almost daily to my kindergarten students during the month of October. The repetitive nature of the book allows the student to join in the reading. Those ready are able to pick up words.It's also fun for the children to act out.If you can find the cassette you're even better off.Great sing-song reading.
4,"Kid Tested, Mother Approved","My two-year-old loves what she calls, ""The Witch Book,"" and asks for me to read it every day. While my four-year-old never requests it, he is more than happy to listen along. The inclusion of monsters adds child interest, but does so in a fun, rather than scary, way. The story also includes gardening and cooking, which are two activities I enjoy with my children. Silverman uses splashes of rhyme that add character to the text and thankfully are not sing-songy. Her spicy vocabulary is a plus. I love the art work. My complaint is one that my children do not share--I think the story is too repetitious. However, kids thrive on repetition, and it isn't Silverman's fault that I've read the book a bazillion (hey, it's a word now) times."
5,Great book!,"I can't believe I have never tread this book until this year! I've been teaching 17 years and this by far is now my favorite Halloween book! Look up the recording, the voices are PRICELESS! Great fun for for K-2."
4,Fun Book for the kids!,"Just received this book and read it to our 4 year old at bedtime. It's a funny story that introduces all the traditional characters of halloween. It's simple, yet fun. I definitely recommend it."
1,not great with a kindle,I love this book as did my children. However; for the kindle the font is to small while trying to read it to a child. I returned it. I would buy it again in a heart beat if it had the recording with it.
1,This book is terrible!,"I didn't get on here to rate this book, in fact, we don't even own it, we read it from the library, but I was shocked when I saw the star rating so I felt I had to warn people. In this story, the witch repeatedly kicks the pumpkin, and everybody is in a bad mood ""humphing"" everyone else. It's just a negative book, no fun, and everybody is grumpy!"
4,Fun Read,"We have a lot of fun reading this book. It made ghosts, witches, bats and the like as susceptible to failures(?) as the rest of us."
5,Big Pumpkin Audio Story,This is a wonderful story and an even better retell on the audio CD. I use in my classroom every year and the kids LOVE IT!
3,Very BASIC!,"A door opener, maybe, but also very basic. I needed something slightly more advanced than this picture book text. If you have no experience with web pages and limited experience with computers, this might be the book for you. For me, it was a waste of my money."
1,Best in the Biz,"This hydronic zone valve has 3/4"" sweat fittings and a N.O. switch that is used to turn on a 12V or 110VAC pump when the valve opens fully. Ordering & shipping was fast & easy - although installation was not included :)"
2,not the best,The shelves for the shoes are so narrow only a select type of shoes will fit. Put a shoe in that is too big and the door wont close. So we found we could not put in as many shoes as we had hoped even with adjusting the shelves. With 3 shelves there was no way the door would close. So had to settle on 2 shelves. Maybe 3 would work if you had nothing but baby - small kid shoes.
1,Terrible design,"The design of this thing is functionally awful. A normal pair of mens 9 1/2 oxfords has to be stuffed into it to fit. What's worse, it will literally destroy a pair of shoes with prolonged use. Putting in and removing a pair of shoes once left scuff marks all over them."
4,Very Nice Indeed,"I went to the theater to watch this with my ten year old. I didn't know how she would react because it is black and white. We both loved it! Beautiful people in wonderful late 40's clothing. There were a few jokes that she didn't catch, but were fun. This is wonderful and I highly recommend. I do not think that it is historically accurate, at least not too much. So, I wouldn't recommend for any type of research, but lots of fun and pretty to look at."
1,Dated film,This movie is dated and says nothing but only the couple relationship. Sorry but this film is dated and should have been called something else and Titanic
3,Eh...............,"Although the great treatment of 20th Century-Fox is evident; the stars shine, so does the dialogue and so forth....But when the ship finally hits the iceberg it is over much too hurry and we are left with a sentimental ""Nearer My God To Three""(The films was at one time supposed to be named that).... AAll the expecting panic and disaster one would hope for is never there(if only too brief).... if it had... it would have made this excellent fictional account of the Titanic, a classic, if on the fairytale-side...."
3,Strike a berg with a song on your lips.,"Best part of the whole film was that of college kids singing the Williams College fight song, ""Yard by Yard"", as the Titanic strikes the iceberg."
2,a Stinking Sinking,"This is not for those hoping for more that a romance that uses the sinking of the Titanic as its backdrop. It is poorly acted, full of campy gestures, lines and effects. Buy ""A night to remember"" directed by Roy Ward Baker. It is so excellent. It has the personal stories but delivers them more effectively and with none of that overacting that typifies so many films produced to showcase an actor or two."
3,A lot of rich people died?,"The idea that this was somebody's fault has always plagued discussions of the ship wreck?The captain and crew thought they had an unsinkable powerhouse of a steam ship that produced speeds unheard of in those days of 25 mph.The company plan was to make a record time on the maiden voyage.Had the steel in the hull been of any where near modern hardness,one doubts that ice could have cut through it.Soft steel, a bad watch and a lazy crew who were enjoying themselvesseem to have resulted in over a thousand deaths.The reason that it got such coverage is that they claimed it was unsinkable, and many very rich people were passengers who died.This movie isn't the modern romance, but did have Robert Wagneras a young love interest.I didn't like the film much."
1,Bad Movie,This movie isn't accurate. There are alot of things in it that aren't true in it. Don't waste your time on it.
5,Titanic,This movie is a good movie alot like James camerons movie. it is as good as A Night to Remember. A must See for Titanic buffs
3,Good acting by Webb and Stanwyck,"This movie was made before the book A Night to Remember was published; so, I give it a pass on its lack of veracity at times. What I love about it is the acting of Webb and Stanwyck who bring their considerable skills to actually making the script way better than it is..................frankly comparing them to the awful performances of Kate and Leo is like comparing Mozart and Handel to Jan and Dean.If you are Titanic nut like me, this needs to be in your collection."
4,Inaccurate but Impressive,"Hollywood's first dramatization of the great maritime tragedy. Despite the interjection of a rather foolish fictional plotline, the natural power of the tragedy is maintained, and as usual, Barbara Stanwyck gives another intrepid performance as the runaway socialite wife to the rather bitchy and foppish Cllifton Webb. Their shipboard confrontations sizzle and add spark to the story. There won't be a dry eye in the house when hearing Stanwyck's poignant, desperate cries for her son as her lifeboat lowers into the sea. Richard Basehart is also wonderful as a drunken priest who must return to his family in shame. Brian Aherne is a ludicrously dapper Captain Smith (the real Captain Smith was a grizzled curmudgeon). The screenplay and dialogue were both lean and well structured, and James Cameron would have done well to watch this version several times before penning his lurid and overblown screenplay for TITANIC 1997."
4,Best of the Titanic movies!,"I don't remember when I saw this the first time,But I much prefer it to its highly hyped 1997 successor. I rented the video the other night and still sniffled at the end. I would imagine most viewers don't know that it won an Oscar.(For best screenplay,I think.) My mother was just thrilled with the very young Robert Wagner. Does anyone know what happened to Audrey Dalton??? One of the best ""minor"" characters had to be Richard Basehart as the defrocked priest. and wasn't that Edmund Purdom(uncredited) as ""Mr Lightoller? Barabara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb were excellent too. Characters much more clearly drawn than in the 1997 version. Class distinction is not as hokey as Jack and Rose. Was Thelma Ritter supposed to be ""Molly Brown""? I think the effect of the film in black and white works very well(NO COLORIZATION PLEASE!)"
4,"Not Very Accurate, But An Interesting Film Nonetheless","This film is not historically accurate, but it represents an innovative portrayal of the sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic. Give the screenwriter a break: whether the ship is going to sink is never in doubt, but adding a new plotline gives viewers something to follow as the movie works toward the inevitable ending."
3,Titanic 1953,"My father wanted that movie. He had before on vhs. So i asked my dad. Do you want it on dvd, i said. So he said sure of course. So that's why i purchase on this site. I knew on internet somewhere it would be easy to fine. So my father is very happy now that he have this movie."
3,"Historically Inaccurate, but good acting","Glaringly historically inaccurate, but an ok film. The ship looks nothing like the Titanic inside or out. The actors playing the famous peoples parts were really poorly cast. For instance John Jacob Astor did not look anything like he does in this movie. He looked like he was in his late Fifty's. His wife that was supposed to be 18 I think it was looks like she is in her late 30's or 40's. The band leaders name was also in correct in the movie as well as a strange edit where it shows the ship hitting the burg on the wrong side of the ship after turning the ship to the starboard side. To bring in the inaccuracy's of what happened while sinking and such is not fair since the ship was not found till 1985. There is more to be said, but Cameron's 1997 film and Night To Remember tells Titanic's story the best. This one is good entertainment, but that is all. Rent it."
1,"Don't buy it, just go to the library","This is a basic grammar exercise book, written by the mom of DFW. It's pretty sad. Ask yourself, What kind of person wants to teach grammar? The self-same sort of pedant who insists that you should never say ""ain't."" Oy. This sells for almost $100 used on Amazon. It's clearly priced for DFW groupies. The straining jokey tone encapsulates the worst part of DFW's nerdy need to over-explain."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The pricing is way off, I seems like they surveyed these companies 10 years ago. I also haven't heard of many of these companies"
1,rip off,"this series is a bad, bad, bad, rip off of sailor moon. and what kind of name is wedding peach? why are girls of the age of 14 getting married anyways?"
1,"Green Ghost, PLEASE!","I only rated this book 1 star because I didnt like it, then I skipped to the end and I liked the plot a little. I could totally tell who the bad guy was. By the way I used to think of the 3 investigators like it was real! I don't think that many people would think that there was a real ghost. You TOTALLY won't get scared of this book (Ha, Ha, Ha!)! This book really disappointed me after I put down the book(I didnt read the whole thing). I was wondering if anybody could write such a bad book with these extreme characters. Trust ME don't read this book 1, it may dissappoint you. This book is a horrible book!!"
1,The CD-ROM will screw up your Explorer screen,"When I installed the compiler CD ROM it rendered the right side of my explorer screen blank, so that I could not see files within folders. There is no warning in the instructions. I called the 800 number on the CD, but was put on hold for five minutes and then disconnected. This happened twice. I tried to email them at their ""my2cents"" address but got an error message saying their mail server was invalid. My computer is now messed up and there is no way to get help. It might be a simple problem, but I bought this product because I'm a 'dummy.' Do not purchase this product as they are not interested in the problems their software creates!"
2,Don't be fooled by the name,"If you are serious about learning V.B. 6.0, this book is not for you. The software that comes with the book contains no online help and does NOT compile. Spend a few extra dollars and buy ""Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition"". It has the complete online MSDN library for all the help you need, and you can compile your projects into actual executable files."
1,This book is NOT what you think,"The title of this package is outright wrong. I've been programming for over ten years and when something says ""COMPILER"" I expect a compiler. The working model included in this package lets you build programs that run in the IDE but does not compile to EXE's. As for the book, no great shakes. It spends a great deal of time on the RAD but if you want to learn useful VB code, better look elsewhere."
2,Problematic Product,"This product is learner's manual for VB6 combined with a cd-rom allegedly containing a learner's version of the software. Good idea, problematic execution. After a few chapters into the book, I am less than impressed. The accompanying cd-rom of Visual Basic is a scaled down version that does not have all the bells and whistles that are talked about in the book itself. For example, an early exercise directs the reader to put certain icons in a program. According to the book, these icons come loaded with Visual Basic 6. Maybe, but they don't come loaded on the scaled-down, companion CD version. Additionally, the book identifies a particular basic portion of the VB 6 interface called the Immediate Window, characterized as a debugging tool. This tool also does not come with the scaled down version. I am considering returning the product, purchasing the book alone for approx. half the price, and then getting a copy of the software."
3,Not exactly for dummies,"While the book will get you started, alot is asummed. Previous programming experience is helpful."
3,take me back,"..on a saturday night in southern indiana in the early 70's ,you could drive to Jasper In and see this band at a club called the Rustic. Under 21 club that looked the other way while you drank beer in the parking lot. Very cool for a teen kid like me. This band could rock out with some of the period music..aerosmith, zep and the doobie brothers. Pretty ,tan southern indiana girls and good music. the guitar player played a tele with his teeth and hada good jeff beck tone. the singer was a robert plant kind of guy. this recording is okay but i wish they had a livealbum of this period. thanks goliath for all the good times.."
4,antidote to freud,in this book karen horney shows her usual insight and clear writing style as she helps to undo some of the damage done by freud's narrow view of the psychology of the female mind
3,"Perfect fit replacement, but they don't last","I have to say my Casio Oceanus OC-500 is my absolute favorite watch in my collection. But the rubber wristband doesn't seem to last, and of course you must use this particular one (or the all-metal alternative - which I can't use due to metal allergies) due to the unique shape at the watch-end of the band.I love my watch so much I've gone through four of these bands. Every one is a perfect fit, but each one eventually succombs to deterioration and breaks. I can usually get just about a year out of a band. I just wish they could make one that would last longer."
3,Expensive band for a cheap watch,"Expensive, and had to be installed by a jeweler, at an additional cost of $12.00. If this band goes, the watch goes in the trash."
4,Important and Entertaining,Everyone who values music needs to see this documentary. Very informative and very entertaining as well.
4,Engaging Documentary.,"Before the Music Dies is an interesting piece of work. It is a glimpse into the sometimes dirty business that we call the industry of music. I think it is essential for musicians to see this movie, because many of us don't know the worst they have to offer us. From a non-artist point of view, B4MD seems to move a little slow at times, and I wish we could've heard from more ""underground"" artists, and artists who have had notable struggles with the record labels. But it is very informative, and at times engaging. ""those that can, do, those that can't..become critics! Or record execs.!!"
3,Not so great,"The towels look like they are good quality, however, the decal is not and I do not expect it to make it through the wash very many times. I bought this as a gift and probably would have returned it if I had enough time to get something else. Bummer."
3,Look into the mind of the mad genius...,"Jaz Coleman is a man born hundreds of years too late. This spoken word album takes you into the mind that brought about some of the best post-punk music the world has ever heard. Jaz should have been a shaman oh, around four thousand years ago - he believes in magic and desperately tries to cast spells to cure the ills of mankind.Unfortunately, what ends up happening is a confused mishmash of new age beliefs, talks of his travels and some ""music"" thrown in for good measure. Jaz does have a vision and in my opinion it's best conveyed through his music. When he tries to intellectualize and explain the force behind Killing Joke, it comes across as the ramblings of a kook and a charlatan, though it must be said that it's very clear that Jaz is absolutely sincere and convinced of the things he talks about. They just don't make much sense.Recommended only to the most die-hard of fans."
3,Does it or doesn't,"I did get on time, But does it do what it says? no way of knowing, It is not FDA approved but they are charging you top dollar, if it works great I have had been using it 2 1/2 weeks I can't tell buyer beware"
2,Good idea; needs work,"The wind screens, while made of adequate material, do not attach well to the top or sides. There are only a few loops at top and sides which allow wind to easily penetrate canopy."
2,SmartShade owner,"The frame is nice. The canopy being white lets the sun still shine one you making you hot. Bugs also fly in if netting is not being used and the bugs can not find their way out as they keep trying to fly to the top inside of the canopy thinking the sun is the way out. I kept the frame, but ordered a new canopy top from QuickShade part # 140146 for about $60. Now the shade is there for me. This model fits the frame perfect.I would not recommend this to a friend. It is like sitting under a sky light."
1,It's like a one walled house.,"When I bought my swiss gear tent I was really excited to use it for some out door sales. The tent itself seems strong and I'm very happy about the UV ray protective coating on it, which a lot of other white tents are lacking. However I feel that smart shade sunscreen/windbreaker is very miss leading. I believed that I was getting 4 panels to inclose my tent. Rather when I got the package there is only one side flap! I guess one will still be useful in blocking the wind, but as I'm planning on using it for outdoor art sales the one flap will not enclose my tent at night....The fabric seems good but for the almost $20 I was expecting to be able to block off my tent at night. I'm considering returning this product and trying to find cheaper side flaps else wear even if the colors don't match."
2,Sunscreen only!!,"Be aware that this is a rectangular sunscreen ONLY, and not the full tent canopy as pictured. Fooled me, as I did not read carefully enough!"
3,not the color pictured...,"The wall worked fine, except it wasn't white. It was grey/silver. The product is described as white so I hope you read this before you buy..."
3,good solar screen,I bought this to use with another manufacturers canopy. It works well. I noticed that I had to raise the canopy height up a notch higher than I would normally to that the screen didn't hang on the ground. This also allowed me to use the hole at the bottom of the canopy leg to secure the last elastic hook on the screen. The screen did a great job of keeping the sun at bay while allowing enough light through to not be cave-like under the canopy.Overall it was $20 well spent.
5,nice screen...,"Used this along w/ the canopy at recent little league baseball games. Really helped block the sun. If it's too windy, this won't work & will need to be taken down. Great for blocking the hot AZ sun."
3,Sturdy except for the straps,"These wall protect well when they stay in place, but the elastic straps and tiny hooks they use to strap it to the bars of the canopy do not work very well. In a heavy wind, I spent the majority of the time restrapping the walls down. If they were going to re-engineer the product, I would suggest velcro straps, like on the canopy top, or simple ties."
5,Great Canopy!,I have put up E-Z Up tents and I can honestly say that the assembly of the tent is much E-Z'er. I am able to put the tent up by myself (although two people is helpful) very quickly. I think the E-Z Up tents might be a little more heavy duty but that also makes them much more clunky and bulky. For the price and for what I need it for this canopy works great. Highly recommended. I also bought the walls and am very happy with them too.
5,easy and well made,"This shade wall works very well in that it blocks the sun's heat , and wind very well. It is very easy to install and fits perfectly."
3,Not the greatest - Kinda of Woogady,Not the greatest - Kinda of Woogady = Probably should have spent more on an Easy Up . I dont see it lasting more the 2 years of light use. Definatly do not take this to the beach.
4,Works as espected,Works as expected. A little delicate and needs 2 people to setup but I had no trouble setting it up and taking it down and repacking.
4,Better for longer uses,"Great tent, but definitely not a one-person job! The side walls are difficult to attach and a little challenging to figure out the first time, but once you get them up they're great. Worked much better for use on a weekend camping trip than for our farmers market stand--more complicated than it was worth for just a few hours, but for the entire weekend it wasn't bad."
2,no use now,"I bought this with a canopy,, the canopy was a piece of crap and I sent it back now I have no use for this and have no idea if it's good or not"
5,You have a face with a view,"With all the hustle and bustle in today's world, I find myself sitting alone in my room after a long day lsitening to ""heaven"" because if you ask me, i do believe that it really is a place where nothing ever happens."
4,good good stuff,"Although it should have been more a more complete album, and perhaps they could have included some new packaging, this is still a great live album by a great band. I would like to point out--the included vocals of ""Psycho Killer"" are indeed the ones from the film. Erin N., I think the ones you are in search of are from The Name of this Band is... (which DEFINITELY needs to be available on CD, as it is SUPREMELY fonkee!)"
2,Not Their Best,"This album is weaker than the video. Their best live album is 'The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads' which came out in 1982. Unfortunately, it is out of print."
4,I can't stop moving!,"I saw this movie in Harvard Square when it first came out and couldn't stop moving (and neither could the crowd)! The CD that followed was anti-climactic. This one gets closer, but still misses the joy of the movie. Buy the DVD and play just the audio if you want to listen to the whole thing. Thank goodness the DVD finally came out! If anything, this album shows how much the Talking Heads are more than David Byrne. The four are fine in their individual endevours, but are truly alive when together.Please, please, please release ""The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads"" on CD? Pretty please?"
4,A fantastic live album!,"This is a great disc even if you are not a huge Talking Heads fan. It's fun to listen to and is full of the quirky lyrics that made the band and front-man David Byrne famous. Don't let the ""big suit"" on the cover concern you...this disc is definitely a good fit!NOTE: The original verson is good, but you may want to look for the remastered version with a revised track order and bonus songs."
5,At Last!,"SMS, the album was good, but always lacking the spark that the missing songs were on the movie and video. Finally, the wait is over. This version of ""Cross-Eyed and Painless"" is a classic!"
5,Great DvD!,"Great music, great scenes, great dancing! What more could one ask for? Nothing I tell you!Great for putting on in the background while hanging with friends, although sometimes it can distract and derail the conversation!"
3,New version really makes sense,"the new extended version of this album is really worth extra money as one of previous reviewers said.i grew listening ti this version but new one has many songs more that are important too.Talking heads mixed funky pop with quirky social commentary and some psychedelic atmosphere to create their own distinctive sound.""Burning down the house"" or ""Once in a lifetime"" are the best examples.of course ""Stop making sense"" (album was recorded live.the self-titled movie was about the same live concert as on cd) is essential for any respectable music fan but the new longer mix is more good for the added tracks and improvement in sound.get new ""Stop making sense"" along with ""True stories"" or ""Fear of music"".they deserve to be listened"
5,The Talking Heads best collection but not true to the movie.,"While this is ceratainly a fantastic album and probabely the Talking Heads best overall collection it is not the exact sound track as advertised. I own a VHS HIFI copy of the actual movie and have played it in the form of an audio cassette at least 100 times. The current new issue does not contain all the songs in the movie and several of the included tracks are not the ones in the movie. For instance, the hypnotic guitar solo during the introduction to Cross Eyed and Painless, perhaps the Talking Heads most energetic song, has been dramatically shortened from the version in the movie. Despite these frustrating shortcomings the newly released Stop Making Sense is far superior to the original release and should be considered an essential for any Talking Heads fan!"
2,"Not a download genius, but dissappointed","After watching the DVD I knew this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. In my rush for instant gratification I skipped the wait for a CD and downloaded the album. While the clarity itself isn't an issue, the files are full of skips and glitches. They aren't a RAM issue as they occur at the same place regardless of what other work my system is doing. I don't know if this is a file problem, a server problem or what, but if I could I would totally ask for my money back as it is basically impossible to listen without being distracted.On the plus side, amazon's support center was ridiculously fast and helpful with getting me around my work's content filter..."
2,"Better than the last, not quite great yet","I have been running around since the original release of the VHS tape with the exact words to that version of ""Psycho Killer"" running through my head, and even repeated listenings to the other versions won't budge them.""I passed out hours ago / I'm sadder than you'll ever know. / I close my eyes on this sunny day. / Say something once why say it again?""And until a CD version of the soundtrack comes out with THOSE LYRICS (From the VHS track), I will be continually disappointed in the blatant commercialism of the remnants of the group and the studio for pushing this kind of reconstructionalist crud on us. We deserve better. We deserve the REAL tracks from the movie."
1,Don't buy this version! Get the new one!,The newly remastered Stop Making Sense just blows this one out of the water and is worth every additional penny. Really. Don't buy this one.
2,"Ok, but not great",I bought this little book for my toddler who is a horse fanatic. I must say I was a little disappointed. Let's just say that cost/value ratio is a little out of balance. There was nothing too interesting or informative about this book.
2,Very dissappointed,"I loved Harlem world. I llistened to the album every day. I was so excited to get doubble up then I listened to it and was very dissapionted. I know mase can do better. I wonder if I should have gotten the regular version and not the edited. I possibly could have gotten a better experence. Anyway, I gave this CD 2 stars insted of one because Mase is a cutie."
4,accurate,"I, like every one else hated ma dollar sign, then I realised that I was truly jealous of him, like everyone else.The album is not wack it has hot lyricks on a range of topis (other than money and wrenches) and the beats are unique and crisp.Almost like water.I own nolimit and wu tang albums, and i can honestly say that this album can hold its weight with them."
3,It's straight but not what I thought not as good as first,He failed to follow up his his hit album with another great one. It's straight but isn't as good as his first.
3,Mase isn't trying to put it down on this album!!!,"After listening to this album, it isn't what everybody is going to expect but he isn't trying to have it better his last album.Give em a break all he is doing is having fun and that's it."
1,FORGET THIS CRAP! GO GET A WU-TANG ALBUM!,"SINCE 1996, MASE HAS BEEN GIVING US WAYS ""HOW NOT TO MAKE AN ALBUM"". WEAK LYRICS, WEAK BEATS, AND EVEN WEAK VOCALS MADE THIS LP, UM... WEAK! I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT HARLEM WORLD WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN DOUBLE-UP. GO GET A WU-TANG ALBUM FAST! THIS LP DOES'NT TEACH, IT DECEIVES THE LISTENER ABOUT BUYING EXPENSIVE CARS, JEWELS, AND CLOTHES. TOO BAD I COULD GIVE HIM -2 STARS. THANK GOD THIS IS HIS LAST ALBUM, BECAUSE HIP-HOP WAS DEFINATELY NOT HIS TRUE CALLING."
1,"man,this one bit","no wonder this dude retired. funny cause i really liked his first album. the best word to describe this album ""weak!"""
1,Another weak BadBoy joint,"Yet another wack album by BadBoy, even by their mediocre standards. Yeah yeah, I'm hating. Then again, any criticism about anything to the brand of socks you wear is considered playahating to SOME kids. Bottom-line, its another simple LP for simple listening by BB, and not worth the money. (IMHO)"
1,This sucks!!!!,"This C.D. was soooooo bad that I was forced to throw it in the trash(seriously). The beats were very distasteful, and my 2 year old cousin could come up with better lyrics!! There was not one good song on this album, so don't waste your money on this trash!!!"
3,Mase shouldn't have done his thing. But its still alright.,"On Harlem World Ma$e went with Puff Daddy, the cd was made with Puffy's commercial touch, all show. On this cd, Ma$e wanted to do his thing, not with Puffy's touch. So its not as good as it could be. But I like mase, and his ryhmes are still good. And there are some phat tracks, inluding the single out now, Get Ready."
2,What the hell man? How you gonna let Arsenio dog you?,"When I first listened to this CD I was watching old tapes of the Arsenio Hall show (with the volume turned down of course) and Arsenio kept laughing and barking and stuff while Mase was singing. I think he was probably making fun of Mase's new album because I don't think he was laughing at me or his guest because it was Magic Johnson and I'm pretty sure those two get along pretty good. Mase should try and get a hold of him or something and figure out why Arsenio's got beef with his new record. I hate seeing them fight like this. Joey, Philly"
1,DAMN THIS DUDE BE RAPPIN SLOWS AS HELL,I HEARD ONE SONG ON THE RADIO AND I SWEAR I THOUGHT IT WAS A DJ SCREW MIX
1,This was he weakest babboy cd ever,I was expecting Mase's last album to be tight but it is a dud.With these songs you can tell why he is retiring.In the next couple of months the real Bad Boys Puffy and B.I.G. are to be released if they aren't good look for Bad Boy to fold because Faith Evenss and 112 were weak with the exception of the song Anywhere. Mase wll be back to make up for this horrible cd
3,3.5 stars: Bad Boy's golden boy retires...............,"Mase disappointed a lot of people when he abrumptly retired in the spring of 99. This particular joint is a lot more dramatic than the fun filled Harlem World. Anyways, nuff said. Give it up to Harlem's greatest MC, Mason Betha.Top Joints:Stay Out My WayGet ReadyDo it AgainSame N*ggasBlood is Thicker"
1,Mase's Sophmore album fails,"In Mase's first album, Harlem World, Mase had great production from Puffy and the Hit Men. He also had quite a few tracks featuring other artists. It is now apparent, after his release of Double Up, that Mase can simply not rap alone. Maybe it is a blessing in disguise he is retiring. The ""hit"" of this album, ""Get Ready"" featuring Blackstreet, is nothing like his first single off his old album ""Feel So Good"". He attempts to relive old success with a song with Total and one with Puffy, but for lyrical and production reasons, these songs fail. All in all, the M A Dollar sign E is smart to have gotten out of the rap game with just a little dignity. Let's just hope he doesn't come back."
2,Mase's new CD falls way short of his expectations!,"Mase's Double Up Cd: Boo!, flush it down the toilet. I've really learned how to express myself but this CD is a poor attempt for Mase to make up for everything that has happened to Bad Boy Records by coming out with a CD that is extremely poor. I am a Mase fan but this CD is very flat. Not even his supposedly best song ""Get Ready"" feat. Blackstreet is any good. Mase keeps saying the words ""Way Back"" and that's where he is going to be! Way Back in the hip-hop crowd if he comes out with another poor CD as this one. I was very disappointed with this CD. I wouldn't recommend you buying this unless you are a very, diehard Mase fan."
1,You call that music?,This is just another one of the baddboys junky cd when will they learn their no good.
2,Not as good as the 1st and better than Harlem World.,"I think that he should of dropped a ""BOMB"" album since it was going to be his last. I loved the first album all of the songs. I'm not going to ""dog"" this album because I love Mase.... but I know he could of done a better job. It seems like the record was rushed and not all of the artist can get good credit for a rushed album like Mary J. Blige. But Mase is alright w/ me regardless."
2,"I wish Ma$e's lyrical skills would ""Double Up""","Well, this album was released a long time ago, back in '99 when Bad Boy was hot, but now they're not. They're really pushin' Loon these days, which just shows how desperate they are.I bought this album though, cuz as I said, back in '99 Bad Boy was hot. And back then I was in middle school and rappers like Ma$e and Puff Daddy were ""tight"". But even back then I realized this album was terrible. I remember liking a few songs, but they weren't enough to keep me from selling it to the pawn shop for a buck."
4,"Fast, Sexy, Noir-ish Thriller with Snappy Banter","Riding the Brand was a fun read as a sexy, noir-ish detective thriller. I liked the fresh premise: what if some wiseguys ran their venture capital firm using loan shark thuggery, preying on cash-hungry tech company start-ups. I think this is a good offering from new author Bruce Makous. I really like it's similarity to 1930s detective films and pulp fiction novels, with the snappy banter and stylish characters. I'll give a bunch of these out for holiday gifts -- especially friends in Philadelphia and New York, where the story is set. (But my parents will have to find it on their own, as the sex scenes are too hot for this kid to give her folks!)"
4,A Fun Read...Propelled to the Climax,"I wondered, can a detective novel that delves into the similarities between venture capital firms and organized crime be a fun read? Well, I discovered that it could if that book is ""Riding the Brand"" by first-time novelist Bruce Makous. Snappy dialogue, somewhat likeable bad guys, and flawed heroes reminded me of Elmore Leonard's style, but Makous is true to himself. Makous has developed a unique work of fiction that reflects the corporate headlines of the past few years. The story engaged me from the start, and really took-off like a bullet out of a semi-automatic once I got to the halfway point. As I was propelled to the climax, I just had to keep reading to the end. As a result, I didn't get to bed that night until very late, but it was well worth it. If you want to settle in with an entertaining thriller while also taking a look at the controversial side of the business world, this is the book for you."
3,"Great story potential, not fully achieved","Great storyline, but I expected more from the writing/writer (maybe that is the problem with being a big fan of one of the writer's previous books,Family History: A Novel, also a novel about mother/daughter relationship). I gave it three stars because of the great characterization of Ruth Dunne and for the story line. Couldn't give more because I couldn't stand the number of question marks in each page: everything Clara thinks/does is preceded by a question the character puts to herself (you could just remove all these questions and still have the same feeling about the doubts/questions in Clara's mind)."
3,A Little Abrupt,"I really enjoyed the story until the ending which seemed both out of character for the protagonists and very abrupt. It really had the quality of ""Then they all went off to the seashore"". The end made the text up to that point seem to be a lie or seemed a lie itself. I thought that it was a good story with a good conflict but, unfortunately, a very poor resolution."
2,Characters Hard to Believe,The main character is not developed enough to generate any real sympathy for her. The plot is superficial; there is no great depth or substance to it.
4,this novel is not black and white!,"Loved the storyline and the many different emotions it uncovered yet I felt the characters lacked some development. There are so many issues this story touches on...sisters, marriages, exploitation, pornography, age of reason, etc that I thought if this were a book club book, we'd have to make it an extra long discussion.As I said in my title, I loved the play on words in the book title, b/c all though the photos were in black and white...this story is positively grey on ethics."
2,Been there done that,The Dark Dreamweavers isn't the worst book Iever read but I think close to it. With all the good books out there try anything else.
3,The Dark Dreamweaver,"When I read this book, I enjoyed it, but I never saw any real emotion from the characters. The book's plot line, on the other hand, was riveting and suspensful. It begins in a small suburb where the main character David discovers a caterpillar that is actually a wizard named Houdin from the magical world of Remin where the dreams come from and spectrum is the power. He was turned into a caterpillar by an evil wizard Thane who wields the imaginator and uses it to make dreams into nightmares. Accompanied by strangecompanions such as Queenie, the wolfat, Sir Heads-a-lot, the entertainer, and Aradel, the big living blob, David sets off to stop Thane. I gave this book 3 stars because, although lacking real emotion, it had an amazing plot and a colorful group of protagonists."
4,Good Deal,"Who'd think it was this difficult to find 1oz. Single-serve peanut packs in bulk? Now that I found the source on Amazon, their delivery is a breeze. Quick delivery; fresh product; fair price."
5,Good Snacking,"These are the perfect size serving for a quick snack. I like to have a handy little pick-me-up snack in my drawer at work & these are just the ticket. Of course, I have to feed my co-workers too..."
3,What references?,"There is an incomplete list of sources for photographs and sketches based on page numbers in the Acknowledgements section of this book. The photographs and sketches are not individually numbered. I also think the references are unsatisfactory. For example, the author makes a number of assertions about a boyhood friend of Hitler in the Introduction but there is no background material to support these 'facts'. The book is interesting for its shift in focus (aesthetics) but there is an impression of sloppiness that affects credibility in my opinion."
1,who is this book for?,"These reviews are very misleading... they led me to purchase this book! Once I got a copy I was beyond disappointed: this book is an extensive collection of record labels. Little more. I mean, who is this for? People who are interested in how 45s got labeled (or often mislabeled) in the 60s? When is says ""Beatles story ON capitol records"", it means literally."
3,Prelief review,It seems to help but I'm not absolutely sure how effective it is. Have to use some more.
5,A Must Have,"My self and many others think that The Farmers Market cook book by one of the greatest cookbook authors Richard Ruben is a MUST have. Myself and many others also think that this book is one of if not the best cookbook that has come out this year and one of the best cookbooks of all time. If you like Healthy, fun, GREAT food you must go out and buy this AMAZING book."
1,Black Raspberry,"I have taken this product for almost a year, I don't know the benefits, I took this pill in the hope of aiding towards keeping me cancer free as there is a history of cancer in my family, this was mentioned on Dr Oz show! However recently my ins. company Humana sent a supplementary brochure recommending clients to eat fresh fruit and greens and Do Not Use Cancer Fighting supplements so, I trusted their statement and stopped the Black Raspberry. It is a vicious circle that we live in, I decided to put my life in Gods hands, I trust him! This review applies to I P6. and Sour Sop Juice all of which I purchased for the same reason , cancer fighting products which I no longer take. The Sour sop I never tried as it is very high in sugar and cancer thrives on sugar."
1,Pat? What Happened? Very Disappointed.,"I've been follow this guy since the early 80's and absolutely love 90% of what he has done. But this piece of work is, well, less than up to par. If any one remembers ""Zero Tolerance For Silence"" think of that only toned down with the entire PMG. Or maybe a better analogy would be a bad 70's fusion / acid jazz band that can't seem to find any soul or direction. This CD just goes nowhere. Every time I think it's going to get better it doesn't. It just rambles off on another tangent only to get lost in the mish mosh of what sounds like musicians hoping to find some sense of unity. They don't. It's almost like they are trying to pull together past sounds from previous albums and just going for it saying ""OK, lets try this..""....""Nah nah, that doesn't work....how about this?!"".....""Nah nah....that doesn't work either"".....Etc etc. Too bad Pat, I'm starting to lose faith......"
3,The Way Up,"As much as I love this band. I found it to be long and drawn out,with not much new age sound.I prefer PMG CDs that has a variety of tracks where as I know some of them will catch my ear. J."
5,What Real Jazz is all about,"Simply beautiful. They say a picture paints a thousand words. With Pat Metheny, 10 seconds of music paints a thousand pictures. Too good to describe... I First listened to this CD in my car and I swear the sun felt brighter and the grass seemed greener listening to this CD. For anyone looking to get into modern Jazz, or breakthrough progressive music, its all about Mr. Metheny and his all-star line-up. Also, I must comment on Antonio Sanchez's' awe-inspiring playing. More musical than any modern drummer I know. Buy This CD !!"
5,Awesome,"On Saturday Feb 19th, I saw Pat Metheny Group play this entire song live at the Historical Fox Theater in Detroit, MI. Pat, Lyle, Steve and Rest of the Pat Metheny Group have done an Awesome and Magnificent job. This entire 68 minute song will take you on a musical journey up into areas never explored by the Pat Metheny Group. What I like about this album is the fusion used to piece it all the together. I can't wait to get this Awesome 68 minute song live on DVD. This will be added to my collection of Great and Wonderful music that PMG has made over the past years. PMG Fan's you won't be disappointed when you buy this CD."
5,A True Masterpiece,"This Masterpiece is about to win a Grammy! It is my favorite song and favorite album of all time. It is the furthest thing from what you might call ""simple music"". It is uplifting and fills the heart with joy! I have been a big fan of PMG for 27 years now. The Way Up (TWU) is by far my favorite CD from the Pat Metheny Group (PMG).It is a wonderful, intense musical journey. If your a true PMG fan, I think the chances are very good you will really enjoy this CD. If your not real familar with PMG, you need to give this a try, as it just may change your musical life.TWU is not something you listen to just a few times and begin to know it by heart. You really need to listen to this 68:10 song 8 to 10 times before making a judgement. It brings true joy and happiness every time I play it. Enjoy!"
5,"Oh dear, indeed","Precisely, Mr. ""Oh dear"". This is precisely for us Topographic Oceans people who have moved on since then to extended improvisation, symphonies, suites and the like. We want it longer, richer, more complex, more satistfying over a longer stretch. Like a great meal, not an empty snack. The Firebird. A Love Supreme. Music For 18 Musicians. More, more, more.A protest record, indeed, as Mr. Metheny has described it, against ""songs"", stupid lyrics, and short attention spans.So of course it's five stars. Can't wait for the score to come out so we can get together and score-read the way we did in college.Peace."
3,A new PMG direction; I don't quite follow,"I have most of Pat's and PMG's cds, and none have left me quite as confused as this latest effort. As one other commentator pointed out, where is the melody? This recording is more a collection of the performers exhibiting their individual technical prowess, which there is in usual abundance, and thus has the quality of a studio improvisational recording rather than an album of thoughtfully arranged pieces. I just attended their tour in L.A., in which they spent the first half of the show playing the entire album, followed by a second half consisting of a repertoire of past classics like ""Last Train Home"". Guess which half I enjoyed more (and was it my imagination that the audience seemed to agree)? Perhaps, I need to spend more time listening to this album to gain a better understanding and appreciation for PMG's latest direction, but the group's music has never been this inaccessible for me. If you're a PMG fan, be prepared for something a bit different."
2,"Well, well....","What can I say. I'm a big fan of Metheny's guitar...But this album really shows who he is musically. He's a master guitar player, with beautiful phrases, tone, experiments, etc... But here is a question to Pat: Where is the music? The music that touches people's hearts? Why changing keys with no point to it? Or why using harmonies filled with holes and emptiness? Is it just fun with the math? If so, this is not about music, this is about research and science. But to add to it, it's not even interesting... It's a boring math, nothing that sparks an excitement. Music is the truth, you either reach it or you don't. It exists regardless how and what methods we're trying to research it with. So, unfortunately this album did not any touch with the real. It's probably the most artificial of his career, in the full meaning of ""art"" as not natural...I'm giving 2 stars because it's Metheny, but that's it...I know he can do much better, connect through your heart, Pat!"
2,Tedious and boring technical wizardry,"Yikes! I've listened to and loved Pat Metheny Group music for years, but I can barely listen to this album. The music is tedious and uninivting. Despite the absence of a lead singer, PMG still often has a melody or lyric. Most of this latest music is devoid of such themes. For me, TWU is mostly an album of musical stuntmanship. I regret even more going to the concert, but that is a different story. While many people think this album is great, I am unloading mine on the second hand market. It's an album for musical archivists. Ugh!!"
5,The Way Up..........,"Back in the day, back in the 70's, I was just a kid. I think I was 10 or maybe 14 when I first heard of Pat Metheny. My father who has a keen ear for good jazz has been my inspiration and educator. Thanks dad! As for Pat's latest effort? Strength in numbers. I love it when they're together. I love the complexity of sounds and melodies on this CD. That's what they're best known for. That's their signature sound. I've been a fan since childhood and at the ripe old age of 30 something, I still have an affinity for this group. Got cash?"
2,Odd man out,"I just don't get this album. It sounds tired. I've loved Pat's music ever since his late teens. Heck, his grandpa worked where I did--I used to get my Dodge serviced at his dad's dealership--I even lived in several locations he used for titles. I love his atonal stuff and his romantic stuff, his ersatz Dead, his work with Ornette and Gary Burton. But over the last few years, his composing has lost its freshness, its heart.. It is technically proficient--and his soloing has evolved in some ways. But the chord changes and musical phrases are overly familiar here. The form of the work is new, but the content is...well, it sounds like watered down Pat Metheny."
3,"Good, but not great.","I am a huge Pat Metheny fan and own almost all of his work. My personal favorite is ""We Live Here"" with its wonderful blend of memorable melodies and improvisation. While there is some of the ""classic"" Metheny sound in ""The Way Up"", for me personally, there's not enough. I really enjoyed the Opening track, along with the first part of ""Part One"" and ""Part Three"". The remainder of the CD, especially ""Part Two"" really drag with pointless tempo and melody changes.Any true Metheny fan will want this in their collection, but I personally enjoyed ""Speaking of Now"", ""We Live Here"", ""Secret Story"" and ""Still Life (Talking)"" more."
3,SO SO,"I am reluctant to give too much praise to this album. Simply because a lot of it sounds like progressive rock to me. However, there also is that unique sound that makes PMG such an inspirational group -(if you have the patience to listen through the artistic pretentions and the distorted guitar.)"
1,PM what is this?,"Well, I have been a fan for many years and have most of hisrecorded works. I must say this is very disappointing. The musicthemes are weak, unlike most of his recordings..Pat needs tootake a break, or something, he's running out of Ideas!I don't knowif I can get through a second listen to see if I'm missing something...."
3,which Metheny do you want?,"To clarify a bit: As with many great artists (Coltrane, Jarrett) Metheny has very different colors in his musical rainbow. For lovers of serious jazz there's ""Question/Answer"" with Holland and Haynes. For acoustic guitarists there's the baritone solo CD. If you have an appetite for truly adventurous and outside playing there's ""Song X"" with Ornette. This CD will appeal to those who like the Pat Methey Group (think New Chataqua, Offramp etc.) It is ulitmately unproductive to get all twisted up by comparing ""Song X"" with ""Missouri Sky""; I like this CD, the compostions are subtle and explore new territory somewhere between and beyond other PM Group efforts. My favorite? No. My favorites for now remain ""Bright Size Life"", ""Missouri Sky"" and ""Q & A""."
4,Good jazz record but can be repetitive,"When I picked up Pat Metheny's latest effort, I was hoping I'd be impressed with the sort of reputation that precedes Pat back from the old days. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by this record. Don't get me wrong - this is good jazz with high-quality sound. But it is unremarkable, repetitive, and unoriginal. The composition lacks definition and sounds as though the group just got together in the studio and started jamming together without any sense of direction. These being highly talented musicians, the result is musical hodge podge that is pleasing to the ear, but I expected more from Pat Metheny group. The energy and excitement is lacking. The record is more bluesy than jazzy. Perhaps some other CD of Pat's would be a better choice, unless you're a die-hard fan and have all of his other CDs."
5,Great Recorded Music but Incredible Experience Live!,"I'm a PMG fan and didn't hesitate to purchase this album when it came out. I was impressed. It is one of their best. That being said, I attended the February 17, opening concert for the 2004/2005 Way Up World Tour - Buffalo, NY at the University of Buffalo Preforming Arts Center. PMG openned the act with the Way Up - the entire 68 minutes worth. Hearing it performed live simply blew me and everyone attending, away. It was nothing short of an incredible experience. As much as I liked the CD I don't know if I can ever listen to it again and enjoy it as much. However, if you can't attend a PMG Way Up tour concert, the CD is not a bad 2nd best!"
4,A Great PMG Work,"I was at first biased against this CD by the Gavin Wilson comment ""sheer confectionary"" yet purchased the CD because I love the PMG. Yet after a few listenings I understood why there was no ""musical statement"" like other CDs from PMG make: How do you hold the attention of listeners for 68 minutes? Instead this piece flows like a flag in the wind, changing all the time. It is a different way to make music and I think you have to give it a chance to appreciate it. Overall, I think it does show that Pat and Lyle have matured musically and in their compositional thinking. I wish the newness of the Introduction would've been demonstrated more throughout the work because the rest of the CD is obviously PMG music, but it is a very good CD."
5,Infotainment,"This is a great cd for anyone interested in Oval, ambient, or anyone looking for something original. The skipping technique used by Oval (using programs like ReCycle and various other methods) is brilliant. Rather than some ""experimental"" trash, they turn the skips and bleeps into emotional, ambient, and usually relaxing soundscapes that most people can at least appreciate to a certain degree. If you're interested in Oval's strange technique and music, then start with this, or ""94diskont""(a AMAZING disc).As a side note, I'd like to confirm the rumour that they screwed with Aphex Twin's ""SAW2"" to create a track. In a interview with a now defunct Oval member, it is clearly stated that track 9 ('Compact Disc') was created by dissecting and remodeling an unsaid track (or group of tracks) from Aphex Twin's ""Selected Ambient Works II"" disc(which you should also look into if you don't own it)."
2,The Way of Light,"If perversion is your bag, this is the book for you. All the male characters are gay or bi-sexual and all the female characters seem to have multiple lovers which seldom include their husbands. I was bored for most of the book, but stuck it out to the end hoping the big fight scene that is building throughout the book would save it. Talk about anticlimatic. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was the villain. She did an excellent job creating a nasty, female villain."
3,The Way of Light,"For whatever reason, this trilogy took me forever to get through. It's a good series, but felt like it dragged. The ending was surprisingly brutal, but it wrapped everything up well."
1,"Terrible ending to a mediocre series, don't bother","The first book in the series was very promising, even with all the sexual lifestyle situations I don't normally care to think about between men. I could look past it, as I had great hope for this book. Book two was a total bomb and wasn't even needed, a worthless book about a quest that didn't need to be included. Book 3 again started great, but fell completely flat and the characters that were fleshed out in book two were basically useless even after a big buildup. The great battle that was to happen, the fight between good and evil that was promised for 2 books ended *(SPOILER)* with one stroke of a sword. The four people, warrior, magus, bard, and whatever the other one was had no task in the book or the final battle. Do not read this book or series or you will feel like you wasted time after the horrible ending."
5,Even my husband likes it!,"Healthy, whole grain, tasty, quick-cooking - what's not to like? Especially after I followed the recipe and mixed 1 cup of kasha with a beaten egg, then toasted the mixture before adding the water. It comes out with a nice texture, whereas when I made it without doing that, it was sort of mushy."
4,works well,"This item was sent in a timely manner, it arrived in perfect condition, and it works as described and expected."
2,Why is everyone so crazy about this book?,"I don't know why everyone is so wild about this book. I very, very rarely stop reading a book in the middle of a story, but after a hundred pages of complete cheese... (they are still addressing each other as Miss Templar and Lord...) I couldn't stand it anymore. Nothing interesting was happening in this book and the dialogue between the two main characters is generally corny. I thought it was too convenient that they immediately had all these things in common like their childhood, etc. This book annoyed me more than anything else. Unless you like slow starts, boring characters, and blah dialogue don't read this book. (Not to offend those who loved it, but that is my opinion. Thanks for reading it.) :)"
3,The very 1st romance novel I've ever read,"I read this book in September, and it got me hooked on romances.I thought it was good, not great, not awful, but good. Aftergiving it a lot of thought, I think it would have been excitingto have read a book based on the opening pages of this one. Ithought the opening pages were the most exciting ones in thebook."
3,Story line lacking depth,Actually the author had a very good story idea. I felt she didn't expound on her orignal idea and was lacking in how she showed her charters. For instance she didn't let Alistair explain how hr really felt about his first wife. One time he states he loved her then states later she was ruining his life again even from the grave. Even he never showes how and why he loves Grace. To me his charter is just not there. Even Grace with her gift that she is so afraid of that it controls her instead of her controling it. Not realistic. I thought story line great but over all the story is lacking depth.
3,Good overview,"I do not know how difficult it is to find a proper editor these days, but it is clear that this English version of the book was not translated by one born to speak the language. With that out of the way, This book offers rich uniform plates and maps depicting the twin victories over Prussia by Napoleon. Not exactly in-depth, it does claim title to being one of the few dedicated volumes on these battles."
2,"Great Pictures, Bad English Translated (badly written)","The photos and illustrations are great; however, the writing (i.e. translation from French) is very, very poor. It looks like a high school student wrote it for his 10th grade report on the battle. Also, the outlay of the Army Order of Battle's design is difficult to decyfer; I have other books from this series and they are equally written."
3,Doubtful technical work...,"The reforms of the Prussian army did away with the individual regimental uniform distinctions that had been characteristic since Frederick the Great. I eagerly purchased this work for its many illustrations, as I have been unable to find precise details even in Kling. Unfortunately the illustrations are not very accurate. Problems can be detected even by a novice, simply by noting that the facings of the regiment and its grenadier company are at times depicted with two different colors! Hopefully, the rest of the book is better..."
4,Good.,Well this was not what i expected from my first dvd of the doors.If i could buy another that includes Jim without any doubt.
1,All Star Karaoke!,"This DVD is nothing but a bunch of ""musicians"" (and I use the word cautiously) who got dressed up and decided to karaoke in front of an audience. The ""musicians"" included on this ""Tribute"" are a strange choice, and the remaining ""Doors"" seem like an act. They don't belong together anymore. And don't even get me started on Ray Manzarek. What a character! He's the one who started the whole ""Morrison Mystique"" junk and now he's basically saying that all Jim was was a frontman. (Read ""Light My Fire"" by Ray)All I'm saying is that whoever made the decision to do this, and with the people who did it, are not people interested in the music. The ""guest musicians"" are currently unpopular ""stars"" longing to make themselves cool again, or they're youngsters (like ""Creed"", shudder) who need some good PR and want to align themselves with something greater. Too late kiddies. The Doors died with Morrison."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I was a bit sceptical at first about bying a VH1 Storyteller because I thought they were a bit phoney.But I changed my mind.I thought the existing Doors members were professional and layed back, not overly full of themselves.They truly represented the Icons that they are and were very open. I loved how they fielded sensitive questions from the audience.This is the point in history where I think they must have picked Ian Atsbury for the Doors of the ""21st Century.I love this historical document."
5,Bringing back memories....,".....is exactly what this DVD will do for you.Manzarek, Dinsmore and Krieger show us that ""still have it in them"". The only missing element is Jim and they do wonderful with the replacement lead singers! Especially Scott Stapp of Creed. The whole DVD will leave you with goosebumps and wishng with all you've got that we still had Jim around because I'm sure he would still be putting out great music."
5,Works great,"I've been using this with a Fujifilm Finepix F30, and it's been working flawlessly. Let's me take something like 680 pictures on the highest setting! Great storage. Don't hesitate to pick this up."
5,Works as advertised,"Needing a memory card for my Olympus camera, I figured who better to buy from than Olympus themselves. I figured right. The card works as advertised.I ordered the card from Amazon. With their free shipping, I paid less than if purchased elsewhere."
5,tons of storage space,"This card holds so many pics you will never fill it up. I took over 800 pics while on vacation, including video and had alot of room left over. It works great in my Olympus 550"
2,make sure this is compatible with your camera,"I made the mistake of buying this for my Olympus D565 zoom which was a hand me down. Too late I figured out that that it is not compatible with that camera. Not the fault of the seller, but good info to know."
2,took too long,I am happy with the product. I purchased the digital camera at the same time. The problem was when the card did not show up until a week later. I needed to use the camera but without the card it's useless. Sending it regular mail during the holiday season may not have been the best idea.
1,Late delivery,I wouldn't know if the product is good or bad. I ordered a camera memory card midweek for Friday delivery. It arrived Monday the day AFTER I left for my honeymoon. I wasn't able to send this without a star rating. No delivery = No stars.
4,Olympus Memory,"After ordering the new Olympus camera and this memory on the same day, from different Amazon-related vendors, I was ready to start immediately. The camera arrived the next day, but the memory was closer to 10 days. That was within the estimate, but irritating.In the camera though, the memory worked as expected. No surprises is the touchstone for memory and it performs. It's fast and flawless."
4,Great,Great for the price. I use it in my Olympus camera and it stores all my pictures on it very neatly.
3,Phil Karlson directs Robert Mitchum - WB disc problem,"Interesting movie - see other review and google the title - widescreen anamorphic but the disc is faulty in my pioneer player - freezes and locksup frequently - and just in the first 5 minutes.Budget Pioneer player that is brand new, as is the dvd disc. No apparent disc scratches - funky looking tho, on the recorded side with a shaded ring halfway thru diameter of the disc.Ok - no more lockups/freezes after the first 15 minutes.Interesting title about a hunt to trap 2 Malay tiger and a rare hybrid dubbed ""the enchantress"" threaded with Will she or won't she - Elsa Martinelli - in her 2nd wild kingdom title in 2 years, Hatari being the first a year before - trap Mitchum, the world's greatest trapper - while her husband, Jack Hawkins - world's best hunter, looks on approvingly, or not !"
2,Puerto Rico Recipes with a Caterer View,"I enjoyed this book very much. MR. Rosado is a caterer & he pre sented in his book elegant & versatile versions of our native recipes. He has the advantage of knowing the american palate better than us in PR, therefore he adapted our recipes to contain an international flair & a decided cosmopolitan taste. That is not bad because the essence of the recipe is preserved. I also enjoyed the historical facts presented. It is a valuable addition to any Puerto Rican Cooking Library."
4,I'm exceptionally pleased,"This is the first journal I've gotten from this series so I wasn't too sure what I was getting. But I'm delighted with the book. It's slightly larger than the usual journals. Although it doesn't double back on itself like spiral-bound books, the hand-stitching does allow you to open it up wider than regular hardbacks, so you don't have to crimp your handwriting as you near the crease."
5,Handstitched Tao Landscape Lined Journal,This journal is well made and beautiful to look at. The lining is well spaced. It is an item I am proud to keep on my bedside table.
4,Took a Chance,"Hey, I took a chance on an unrated upright bike, and thus far it has paid off. They say you get what you pay for. In this case, this is a BARGAIN. Here is what I like: 12v application, easy setup, I'm 6-2 and the bike can adjust to my height, fits anywhere and it's super quite. Here is what i don't like: Seat could be softer(But not too bad) and could have came with a bottle holder. Other than that, not much to complain about. Not bad Body Sculpture!"
2,Say What?,"What in the world is the manufacturer trying to say/interpret here:""Ergometer Programmable Magnetic Bike in the opinion of Adjustable handlebar by with the help of Deluse clog in the place of solace on by the agency of Ionizer Body Fat and Hand Pulse because of easygoing measurements New Hi-Tech Magnetic Brake System and High Quality no-good belt ammunition for the sake of durableness Adjustable tensity on this account that wide-ranging opposition Deluxe Computer w/LCD to show Body Fat, Hand Pulse, Receovery, Time, Speed, Distance, Calories Used, RPM, and Watt""Huh???"
5,"A Huge, comfortable, durable board for all your jewelry design needs!","This board is really perfect for anyone who designs jewelry.I was looking online to buy 10 boards for my friends that I was teaching some basic jewelry making to, and chose these because of the cheap price and because they were available for free delivery via my Prime membership. I saw the description (""large"") but didn't realize just how big these would be. I have two other boards, my ""large"" board looks small next to this.You will be able to make 48"" long necklaces (largest ring around).I also love that it has 10 sections to keep your beads, findings, and other parts in. I use the 6 small ones to keep beads, the two large ones at the bottom hold completed work and the middle ones are for findings.The quality is pretty good, it is durable, and mine has no scratches, dings or fades yet.I highly recommend it."
5,Love these!,"I use these every 6months. Great for a woman on the go. I feel cleansed and good, but love that's its gentle on your body. Def recommend."
2,Didn't work...,"It just didn't work for me. I went up to the 5 pills twice a day almost right away and about every other day I would have 1 to 2 good bowel movements but I never felt like it was cleaning me out. I did it for 2 weeks and now that I've stopped I'm back to not having a daily bowel movement so it didn't help flush whatever was blocking me up, out.It's not horrible. It didn't make me feel sick or crampy. It just didn't do a whole heck of a lot."
3,It was ok,"It didn't work that well for me. It did make me more regular, which I'm not normally. But considering that I don't go everyday, I expected a lot more waste than I got. It made me go once a day instead of every other day. No pain or major discomfort, besides what you normally feel with a bowel movement. Not bad, just not for me, I guess."
2,Not effective,This cleanser comes with a lot of steps and pills. I followed the directions and it' only after a week i had a bowel movement. I did not feel much of a difference. I still had problems going to the bathroom and it made me very gassy too. Not worth buying!
1,didn't work,"I was excited to try it out based on the glowing reviews, but it didn't work for me. I'm not sure why, I tried it for close to 2 weeks and even tried the max 5 pills. Frustrating!! I finally had to try another product and it DID work - Organic Total Body Cleanse."
1,"If you want something that works, keep looking.","I purchased this in hopes that I would clean myself out a little. I was pretty regular to begin with, just wanted a nice cleanse. After week one, I was constipated, going 2-3 days without a bowel movement. Abdominal pain was not so fun to deal with either. I took the pills exactly as directed. If I decided to do this again, I would definitely do more homework on the subject, and I would never buy or recommend this product for anyone."
1,Save your money,"I love horror & horror comedies, but this whole movie tries way too hard to be 1 big joke about Zombie Woodsmen & it fails hard. If you feel you have to own this, you don't. Buy something else in the Horror Comedy genre like Dead Alive, Brain Dead, Army of Darkness, Street Trash, or Brain Damage. You'll be sorry if you're looking for something decent. This movie maybe alot better if you know fluent Czech, incase something is lost in the English subtitle translation."
4,LOVED IT !,CHOKING HAZARD is one of the smartest & most unique zombie comedies i've ever seen! There is plenty of strawberry red mushy stuff to go around & plenty of living-dead people starving for more strawberry red mushy stuff! This is another great new zombie film that prooves the genre is alive & doing very well!
2,2.5 stars,"This movie was a little to silly for me. he plot made no sense, the dead came to life for no reason and the humor oh jesus was so damn dry it was ridiculous.This movie only got 2.5 stars because I am 50% Czech. Other words it was n not really good at all.So there isnt much to say but every one i feel is overrating this flick by alot.I purchased this flick in best buy for $9.99 so please dont waste what amazon wants . This flick is worth no more than 10 $.Its just a real dopey pointless film where you dont laugh like they say u will and you are not scared and just throught the whole movie you will sit there thinking what in the world is going on, cause I had no idea but did watch it, and i will keep it, its a zombie fl;ick , I guess. There were zombies and they were not good at all. This movie just seems to try to hard at everything and fails to succeed. IMO"
4,A Connecticut Yankees review,"Very beautiful little book, with a lot of the history behind the story of King Arthur, and the different peoples who contributed to it. But if you just want a good storybook, look elsewhere."
3,Not something I would have normally picked up...,"I was required to read this book for a college Western Civilizations class. I would have never read this book otherwise because it did not pull me in. The book is definitely for readers who have a background in history or at least a passion for King Arthur. The book itself was not all bad because it contained a lot of pictures, was a quick read, and continuely refered back to information it had previously stated. That made it a little easier to follow along.Like I said, the book was not horrible, but I don't recommend it to anyone other than those who enjoy history.Its definitely not a page turner..."
3,confortable but lower quality than expected,"I've bought these shoes many times over the years.They are as comfortable as they used to be,but the leather seems lower quality than earlier models."
3,Nice but ware out quickly,Nice shoes but ware out quickly on kids (teenages to be exact). You can expect to replace them in 6 month or less.
5,great shoes,"These shoes are great for school,good support ,easy to put on,can,t buy them in australia,so have them sent over from the US,well worth the postage"
2,bad customer support company,"The purchase was usless to me, i request men shoes but they send me kids shoes,,, and whats more bad that they refuse to replace it ....."
3,"Sizing is off from previous pair, but still love these shoes!","Warning: If you are replacing an old pair, try them on in a retail store first because the sizing is not the same! These are at least a 1/2 inch longer inside and wider than my old ones.That said, I LOVE these shoes. I'm just annoyed that I have to return them, and go find them in a store to make sure a 1/2 size down won't be too small."
5,Merrell Boy's Jungle Moc- 7M Black,Very well made shoes. They hold up well as my tween wears out shoes within a short-time line. Price was competitive.
5,flower magnet holder,"very pleased with product purchased to display my humorous line of magnets at shows and in boutiques. Makes for a great display item, Wish I got the larger one though!"
5,Phanomenal,"A complete witch's brew of the old and new, the hi and lo-fi and a tremendous amount of thought and feeling combine to make a wondrous album. Lots of scratches, high voices and occasional screeching make for a really gentle, and at times uproarious, album, a bit like Daniel Johnston but somehow more European. A great buy, you will not stop listening."
1,don't be blinded,"Listening to this CD with an ""open mind"" will only show that this entire album is a complete waste of your time and money. Is it a parody of ""Revolution 9"" or just an ""eccentric"" who obviously has never worked a day in his life messing around with toys and a home tape recorder? Those who wish to lump this in with the rest of the Elephant 6 works of ""genius"" are obviously too far gone to listen to their own minds, let alone have open ones. Any non-musician with a day off could have made this pretentious pile of tripe in a matter of hours. Genius? Don't be fooled. Buy ""Two Virgins"" instead. I've already traded this one in."
5,Nice!,How nice when you get more than you expected. I ordered two bracelets from GEM AVENUE and both are beautiful. I will definitely be ordering again! Excellent quality. You won't be disappointed.
3,Perfect if you want Pastel Colors,This is a pretty braclet! Good Quality for the price.However the beads are VERY pastel except the one dark blue.So if you are looking for the richer cat's eye beads this is notthe braclet for you. From the photo I was expecting darker colors.
1,Only for extreme novice C++ programmers,"The concept of this book is good, but the execution is seriously lacking.The ""bugs"" in Mr.Oualline's programs are the kinds of errors only the most unskilled novices would make: a missing space character in a format statement; accessing a 5-element array with index values of 1 thru 5; a class whose constructor allocates storage but whose destructor doesn't release the memory. Trivial, easy-to-spot errors that don't really expand anyone's grasp of C++.To add insult to injury, large portions of the book are filled with Mr.Oualline's tiresome war stories and aphorisms.A much better source of knowledge is ""C++ Gotchas"", any of Scott Meyers' books, or the ""C++ FAQ""."
3,unpolished,"This book illustrates several common errors that every C++ programmers will encounter. There is no substitute for learning from your own mistakes, but forewarned is forearmed. If you read this book before you make the mistakes, you will save yourself some time. The humor scattered through the book helps keep the subject light.Unfortunately, the book is flawed beyond those bugs which were introduced intentionally. In one case a program was unintentionally corrected, leaving no errors to be found. Some of the programs seem unnecessarily long for the bug they are illustrating. Like most computer programs, this book would have benefitted from peer review prior to its release."
4,Interesting Read,"I throughly enjoyed this book. I ran across programs and source code that made me scratch my head trying to figure what the heck is wrong with it, only to find a minor little syntax error. The book is written in a laid back comical approach with lots of code sample, and lots of funny tidbits, theorem and true stories about tech support calls.A very nice walk down memory lane, reminding all of us of our humble beginnings and the noobish mistakes we once made."
5,Should NOT even be reviewed,This CD should not even be reviewed.......Its to good..........Just deserves an automatic 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!Audiophile recording to boot!!!!!!!!!TREMENDOUS~!!!!!!!
3,"Weil is great, but you want...","Dr Weil is the most popular, and rightfully so, holistic doctor around. He really knows the real deal, and writes very simple and easy to understand. However, the book you want to buy (and live by), is ""eating Well for Optimum health."" I was a top Personal Trainer for years, a bodybuilder, powerlifter, and nutritional consultant for years, soon to be publishing a book of my own. i can tell you for sure, unlike many (most?) other crap out there, weil is not influenced by any outside financial sources, nor does he fall into any mainstream traps of deception most wanna-be nutritionists (with a bogus licences from the corrupt American Diatetic Association) write about and talk about on TV, which only lead to more confusion. Weil is the real deal."
3,"Great climbs, so-so writing","The climbs decribed in this book show why Messner is one of, if not THE, greatest climber of all time. The book also shows how that description will probably not be used to describe his writing skills. The writing is OK, but it is a little choppy, and the short chapters (one per mountain) sometimes leave the stories feeling a little condensed. It's almost like reading a Reader's Digest version. However, the climbs are spectacular, and in some cases the events do overcome the narrative and shine through."
3,Worth the money,"A must own! But how much better it could have been if Messner was as capable a writer as a climber. Without a doubt Messner is one of the best Mountaineer's of all times, I just wish he would have had someone articulate this book for him. He took some of the most exhilarating experiences anyone has ever known and made them almost sound just a little more exciting then a walk to the corner store. At any rate it is most certainly worth the money and no Mountaineering Library would be complete without it. I wonder if we could convince him to try this one again!"
4,the achievement makes the book,"the sheer achievements of reinhold messner make this book too good to pass. considering the drama and spectacle of what he went through on these numerous himalayan expeditions, this book should be a six star book. alas, the writing is dry as toast. he misses numerous opportunities to put us on the edge of our seats, opting instead to recite a few dull facts associated with truly gripping incidents. too bad; if this guy could write like krakauer, this book would have been on the new york times bestseller's list. still, as a chronicle of this man's superhuman death defying achievements on the world's highest mountains, this is an excellent book. if he could only write like he climbs."
3,Proofreading skills,"Although this book will be helpful to the beginning proofreader, it may not be of use for advanced proofreading. It may help you write better letters, but it's not for the professional proofreader. It does include workbook sections, proofreaders' marks and proofreading strategies."
2,Is this a mystery?,"This book definitely lacks a substantial plot;it's not even a mystery at all.They solved the murder without any real clue.The murder was not an ingenious one;it looked as if it was done by a 3 year old kid.I almost laughed when they solved the ""mystery"".The dialouge falls flat,the characters are unreal and the murder was absolutely dumb.I am only 14 and i don't understand how adults can read this book.Jill Churchill cannot be compared to Agatha Christie,she still has a very long way to go."
2,A disappointing read this time,"The editorial reviews sum up the plot well, but don't say that most of the book has nothing to do with solving the murders. The whole bit about the editor's visit to Washington, the despressing discriptions of the government's treatment of the bonus marchers (some of them children) may appeal to history buffs, but had little to do with the crimes in upstate NY. Also the editor's involvement with one of the marchers,a young mother with two children had nothing at all to do with the murders. She was there in a wagon with a mule. I vaguely wondered about the historical accuracy of that. Would there be a mule pulled wagon on the highways between DC and NY in the 30's? But no matter - it was filler. I read another in this series earlier, In the Still of the Night, and enjoyed it, but will not seek out any more of them."
1,Bad choice - Defect,"I was extremely frustrated when I saw what I bought as a gift for my girlfriend.I ordered this item from Brazil to a delivery in a hotel in NYC, where my parents were hosted.When they came back to Brazil, and I opened the package and I could see the backpack was defective. One strap of the backpack has a defect in the seam. I have photos of the defect.How can I solve this problem?"
5,I think it is great!,I think it is very complete and rigorous. Congratulations to the author. I found it in internet looking for Tomatis method information.
1,Insubstantial,"Originally published in 1971, the book offers no new information regarding the eastern front during WWI. While the period and place hold considerable interest, this book does not come close to satisfying it, except, perhaps, as a precis. One would be better served to consult SLA Marshall in the American Heritage volume on World War I."
3,A good introduction to a poorly understood part of WWI,"Alan Clark's overview of the Eastern Front in World War I is a good starting place for readers to know more about the ""war to end all wars."" A considerable number of U.S. books have been devoted to the Western Front, which is understandable since it was where American soldiers fought and died. But far fewer works have dealt with the catastrophe of inept Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies at war. What is obvious from Clark's work is the tragic cost of the war for those two empires. What also emerges is the obvious superiority of the German command in comparison to its Russian and Austrian counterparts and, by implication, the over-confidence that this performance bred for the next world war. The author -- who often came under attack (sometimes rightly so) from the academic community -- also includes suggested additional readings on the Eastern Front."
3,Needs homework,"I concur with previous comments that much of the book addresses aspects other than Marine Corps Medal of Honor RECIPIENTS (emphasis added.) In scanning the volume I found little new, other than the surprising revelation that naval aviators flew Bell P-39s. That's the result of incompetent research and editing. Otherwise, a decent primer on the subject."
4,the textbook on Bosch fuel injection,Written as a textbook and how-to. Good illustrations. Best when used with the Bosch factory manual
4,by charles o.probst,"is this book have got problems and solutions about injection of cars,electrical and other problems.for all cars and exectlly for germany cars.."
1,I wasted money on this book.,"Since there is no information about the detail of the book, it was thought that diesel engine's fuel injection system is the main content of the book. Unfortunately however, there is only some things relating to gasoline engine's injection system, and no theory analysis is included in the book. It is definitely not recommended."
4,A very good explanation of BOSCH fuel injection systems,"A very good book that explains how all the bosch fuel injection systems work. It has some diagnosis charts that take you step by step on diagnosis and repair of the different parts of the injection systems. However, the author missed on how to internally tune the volumetric air meter, which is the most important piece of the system. The performance tuning part gives you some ideas on how to modify your car injection system. I used it to modify the system on my car, with some gain in performance. It has a lot of pictures and explains very well what it covers."
3,Not what I had expected..,"If you own a vehicle with a BOSCH Jetronic system, then I highly recomend this book. However I think beyond that its not of much use. Personally I bought this book for the purpose of aftermarket tuning of engine management systems, however this book doesnt touch on it as advertised. It does a good job of teaching you EM basics...however you can learn the same for free on specialty websites. The author really does not seem to support DIY performance tuning. I was hoping this book would take on how ECU's are tuned, but it does not. Its a great tune/repair manual for these types of EM's...but it stops there. If you dont own a Jetronic style system (which for the record most stand alone units are not like), dont buy this book in my opinion.I give it 3 starts based on what I was expecting...but if you need a repair manual...its worth 4 or 5."
3,"Very good, but dated","If you have read any of Probst's books you know what to expect: good, clear textbook-liked explanations, except not as dry as most textbooks. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is, it only covers systems through early 1990's, and Amazon doesn't tell you that. The book cover led lead me to believe it covers more than it does, too. Of the Motronics, only the earliest versions are discussed. The book is Copyright 1989 and 1991, but I don't know when it was printed. Probst died in 2000. So, if you are specifically interested in understanding how 1980's Bosch FI systems work, this is the book to buy. What is covered, is covered well. To learn how to apply this knowledge to repair and tuning, keep looking. One suggestion, check out the VWVortec list on the web."
3,Very good overwiew of Bosch EFI,It is a very easy book to understand and can be usefull for those want only to know how the Bosch's EFI works. There are several photos and diagrams showing how to troubleshooting and service a real EFI.
2,Bosch Fuel injection and Engine Management,"A good general overview of the Bosch fuel injection systems but no diagnostic help for the ECM or ECU for the L-Jetronic. This is disappointing, you would think that these authors could tell you how to check the various functions of the control unit. If you want a light read with no real help, go for it."
5,Very clearly written,"I used this book (with bentley factory manuals) to replace the KE motronic (continuous injection) FI system which came stock on an audi engine with a LH jetronic (pulsed injection) FI system. This book is excellent--easy to read, well illustrated, detailed, and methodical. I'd recommend it to people interested in knowing how FI systems work--they're really fascinating--as well as to people who just can't resist opening Pandora's box. It does not cover reprogramming ECU's, but that's a subject of it's own anyway."
4,great reference,This has been an invaluable purchase for working on my BOSCH fuel injection. The book reviews multiple BOSCH systems and educates you on the theory of how they work. The troubleshooting chapters have been excellent to help diagnose problems. It is a very comprehensive manual that any classic European car owner should not be without.
5,Very good book- helpful and not too dry,"I bought this book to help me figure out why my 1984 Vanagon isn't running correctly. So far it has been a very good resource. It breaks down the fuel injection system into manageable easy to understand pieces. I strted trouble-shooting and found out that my injectors are not spraying properly, so I have sent them out to be cleaned, hopefully that will fix the hesitation/surging unburned fuel issue that I'm having.Usually I cannot read this sort of book for more than a few minutes without getting bored, but this book is written in a way that makes it easy to understand. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to learn how fuel injection systems work, and how to work on them.It is a little hard so far to fully grasp the pressure system, but I'm sure that's just me, I will keep reading it and I'm sure it will sink in. I've just had this book for about a week."
1,Waste of time,"This book is a dissappointment and not even worth the [money]. Most of the information in the book is very INACCURATE and does Left Eye's fans a disservice. Instead of a honest approach to it's subject, this book comes across as a lazy analysis and tool for expoitation of a celebrity who died too soon. I reccommend readers SKIP THIS BOOK!!"
4,In loving memory of a supernova,"I ordered two books recently, one being Aaliyah: an R&B princess in words and pictures and the other Lisa Lopes: The life of a supernova. I have to say that the latter surpasses the first. While Aaliyah's biography by Kelly Kenyatta was somewhat childish and too fairy-tale-like, Lisa's, on the other hand, is a superb and brilliant tribute to the talented artist and beautiful person she was. Unlike Kelly Kenyatta, who seems to pretend that Aaliyah was absolutely perfect, Nancy Krulik does not try to hide Lisa's weaknesses from the reader. We all knew she made several mistakes in her life, like burning down her boyfriend's mansion, and that she had drinking problems. But all this didn't make her a less good and caring person. In spite of her crazy side, feuds with the other TLC members and all, we truely feel that Lisa was searching for inner peace. Sadly, before she passed away, she seemed to had found it.RIP, Left Eye."
4,Beautiful Watch but...,"I really like this watch, and it meets most of my expections. Not a round face but not quite a perfect square face either, the band is thinner than I expected, but I am use to it now plus it keeps accurate time, it's pretty and the price, I suppose, is quite reasonable. I wear it to work and here I found that its band is not scratch-resistant. The finish is pretty much ruined now and really only noticeable if you look at it carefully, but it is still functional and really I got it as a work watch that wasn't too basic or too fancy. It is just right!"
4,"nice watch, good purchase","Nice watch, looks distinguise and a good prices, best of all water resists.luis Lugo"
2,out of work,"i bought it last year. and it has been used for only about 1 year. but now it doesn't work. what's the problem. I think it's powered by quartz not by battery, right? what can I do right now? is any warranty with this casio watch? thanks a lot."
2,not quiet what I was hoping for,"I guess I assumed between the name Coleman and the looks of the picture I was getting a more .... substantial dog bed. It is not as thick as it looks in the pictures, although dogs will still lay on it. I am keeping one for my dogs, but am not happy enough to give the second one away as a present and am returning it."
4,Coleman Pet Bed,Very nice bed for the money but could use some more stuffing. Not as full as in the picture. Overall a good purchase.
2,Where's the bed!,"Although the case is of good quality, the inside material is almost non-exhistant. I intend to purchase a piece of foam for replacement."
3,A little flat,"Great cover. Filling never did fully expand. Ended up buying another manufacturer's bed to insert into cover for the comfort of my dogs. Otherwise, the filling was useless without the additional one I bought separately. The cover was much more durable, colorfast, and more what I expected. Just be advised the purchase is really for a cover, not a ""bed."""
1,not long-lived,"We bought this bed 4 years ago. Initially, it was a fine purchase. But it soon became evident that dog hair stuck like glue to the flannel surface. Meticulous hand-vacuuming could remove 60%, but no more. It did not handle repeated washings well--the cover did OK (though it managed to cling to most dog hair throughout it's spin in the washer), but the cushion inside bunched and lumped despite closely following the manufacturers instructions. We're on the lookout for something a little less hair-attractive for our new puppy."
4,my dog loves this bed,My dog loves this bed and I think it is for the reason that others have said they don't like it - it isn't completely full of filling and allows her to snuggle into it rather than just lay on top. My only complaint is that she sheds alot and it is very hard to get her hair off the plaid top. Someone wrote that she turns it the other way with the nylon side up and I'm going to try that and see if my dog likes it as well that way.
4,Colleman Pet Bed,My dog love it. It's good for medium and large dogs. It's washing machine. Very good product.
5,Coleman Pet Bed,This is the second Coleman bed I have purchased for our Cocker Spaniel. He's about 35 pounds and the bed is just the right size for him. Others have said the bed doesn't have much padding... but the dog sleeps on the rectangular bed all day in the living room and the round bed all night in the bedroom. Evidently he finds it very comfortable. The quality is excellent and it's easy to clean. I recommend it highly.
2,Cover sucks.,"This comes in a vacuum packed bag (the pillow) that puffs up fairly quickly. As for the cover, we put it in the kennel and by the morning she had ripped it to pieces. I'm not fully blaming the cover, but with a name like Coleman I'd expect it to hold up a little better. We are still using the pillow and I'm looking into getting a denim cover. Just know that if your dog is the least bit ""chewy"" this one won't last."
1,Inferior quality pet bed,"I purchased the Coleman Classic Rectangular Pet Bed in June of 2010. This product was overpriced and of poor quality. I followed the washing/drying instructions. Within a short time, the plastic (maybe it's rubber) glued to the inside of the removable cover of the bed started to peel away from the flimsy fabric. I had many small pieces to clean up in my dryer and on the floor. I wrote to Coleman and received a terse reply...something to the effect the product was not guaranteed and so there was nothing they could do to rectify the problem. That meant I could not even return it. (BUYER BEWARE! Look for guarantees.) This product does not even deserve one star, but I was compelled to rate it at the adjuration of Amazon.com. I've found products similar to this pet bed at K-Mart, Walgreens and Wal-Mart for less than half the price AND of better quality."
4,Great watch for under $10,"Between my hands-on job involving solvents and my toddler, I can't wear pricey watches anymore and was looking for a cheap, reliable replacement. I normally go to Timex for my every-day watch but after my last one broke, I decided to give this Casio watch a try. I'm happy to say it looks very nice and stylish - I particularly like the sleekness of this watch which seems to make my forearms look slimmer. The strap is comfortable, the watch is water-resistant (at least so far!) and it tells the time accurately. For myself, that's all I need in a watch at the moment so this has worked very well for me."
2,Hands are not bright enough.,"It's difficult for me to see the time because the hands fade into the background. I like the large numbers, but not enough contrast between the background and the hands."
5,Easy to Read,I got this watch for my mother who is far sighted. It has a large face and is very easy for her to read. It is also attractive looking.
2,Bad gift,"This item was delivered quickly and in good condition. I bought it for my wife as a present, but she didn't like it so I gave it away."
2,its ok!,watch face was great but the band length was very short for a mens watch. i still love casio and will wear this but the band is not as comfortable as other ones i have had.
1,casio womenwatch,I sent this watch back to Amazon (and was never credited for the return) because it was so huge. It was much larger than it appeared in the photo and I thought that they had mistakingly sent me a man's watch. It would have been just what I was looking for if it had been a little smaller.
5,fantastic,i am on water polo and swim team and i wear it during practice and it works perfectly! i can only hear the ticking when my ear is close to or if its deadly quiet. and it looks fantastically
3,Handy,"Great watch for the day activities. Nothing fancy just works and feels confortable in your wrist, must have if you don't need too much."
3,Okay overall,Didn't really like this watch as it was too cheap looking and not the size I expected. I sold it to a friend.
5,A decent deal,"This is simple, clean and light. I bought it for taking an exam. It served very well. It stands on the desk well and the numbers on its face are big enough to time the exam. After the exam, still I am wearing this watch. It looks nice with not-too formal outfits. A good deal for its price!"
3,It's alright....,Basic watch to tell time...nothing to write home about. Easy to read the numerials. Light weight. Ok for everyday use. Looks plasticky.
4,"Nice watch, large face","This watch is just fine. I work outside everyday and it holds up well. It's comfortable and it's easy to tell the time. The face is large on a small wrist - it's about the size of a half dollar. If you know that and that is OK, than the watch is a good deal for you."
4,"Size larger than expected, visible numbers",I bought this watch for my mom who wanted something with large numbers. The size of the watch was bigger than expected. Otherwise its an excellent product.
5,perfect work watch,"I have to give this watch 5 stars because I love it -- except for one thing -- the hands are silver. I would have liked them to be black. I work mostly in low light conditions so they aren't so easy to read quickly. But other than that I love it. It's a work watch and that's what I wanted. It has a great foot print, big enough to see but not ""fat"" -- doesn't get caught up on things. I really like the strap. The piece that holds down the end looks like it will last the lifetime of the watch - that's the part that always fails on the watches that I use. But if Casio could just make the hands black ..."
1,serves its purpose,go to home depo and buy this for 1$. I purchased this online purely out of laziness. Not worth more than a dollar.
3,hard to pull through,"Although I very much enjoyed the descriptions of Amman and the people in Amman, I had a very hard time pulling through the book.The style is very copious and hard to get through. Many of the descriptions are worth reading and are interesting, but as far as seeing the authors point at the memoirs, he doesn't get to until the end.At the end you feel like the author had to get all of descriptions out of his mind on paper in order to start a new chapter in his life in Iraq. The only common motif throughotu the novel is the grandmother. Although descriptions and people come and go, the grandmother is at the beginning and the end fo the novel.A lot of historical background is necessary in order to fully comprehend the details and events described in the memoris."
5,More abstract,"Markus Popp has taken Oval on an interesting journey over the years. Never has he strayed too far from the original premise: digital sound manipulation. But whereas Systemisch focused on a rigid timelocked structure of clicks and pops, and whereas Diskont relied heavily on the use of skipping CDs and recordings, dok uses the recordings of Christophe Charles as its source material. Markus Popp has taken these recordings and processed them into almost completely digital tones and drones, but there is a humanistic organic quality to the music that makes this one of the finest moments of Oval's career so far."
2,Pretentious ambient,"While not the absolute worst avant garde ambient out there, Dok certainly does appear wet behind the years compared to the new generation of lab toppies making noise out there today. Besides for a few intriguing moments, this disc pretty much coasts by to me at an experimental pace, drowning the few decent droning electronic moments out with determined repetition that comes off more as exercise then experiment."
3,wife reads it.,seem to be a ok book.my wife is the one reading it and I am getting some good food out of this.
1,I hate this DVD,"This DVD is falsely advertised. There is a ""Parental Advisory Explicit Content"" Sign on the cover art yet no ""Explicit Content"". The videos have the edited and radio lyrics on them. With the Parental Advisory sign, you'd think that the explicit versions of the song would be dubbed over the videos but no. The only thing explicit is the use of the word ""B!+ch"" InShe's a B!+chand that's usually not explicit enough for a parental advisory. So I found this dvd to be a complete waste of my money. Now that Missy has 5 albums out and a new one on the way, She should release a new Music video DVD. Avoid at all costs"
3,"Miss E's hits, and misses.....","Missy Elliott is an inventive and always fresh artist. This collection of videos is no exception. I love the videos on this disc, but the behind the scenes of She's a B**** and Supa Dupa Fly are very short, and not what I expected. Also, the DVD is sold with the Parental Advisory label on it, so I bought it immediately thinking that it would be the uncencored cuts of her vids, but these are the bleeped out MTV versions, which was very dissapointing. Don't get me wrong, the videos are good, but I would've loved to see them in the way they were meant to be artistically presented and not some souped up version for a 13 year old. Why else the Parental Advisory label? There's nothing raunchy nor explicit in this DVD, so if you are expecting it, don't buy it. Overall though, I was pleased with the videos, as they are some of the most inventive artistic expressions to hit the music scene in a LONG while. Lookin forward to volume 2, maybe it'll be a little better..."
2,Overlong Magazine Article,"This book has pretences of exploring the mother-daughter relationship, but it never goes very deep. The author is more concerned with appearences than making a true connection with her mother. I found her ideas to be rather 1950's, as she searches for an identity through marriage and the done to death 'city vs. country'. Her husband is portrayed in a rather one-dimensional manner as a saint who puts up with her dramas. Overall, I do think this book tries to be honest. In the way, however, is a perspective that can't do justice to the weight of the material."
2,Insipid rather than inspired,"This book never really rose above the level of ho-hum magazine writing, despite the author's obvious attempts to sound sensitive, charming, etc. After a while, it felt like eating too much tapioca pudding: a little went a long way."
3,Organic D&B,"3 1/2The reliable one man band of Mice Parade is guaranteed to please if you are a beat-oriented percussion hound of open mind. Weaving exotic, although highly circular instrumentation around his intense, intellectual drumming, Adam Pierce provides vibrant counterpoints to so much generic idm pervading so much of the scene. Some of these eccentric compositions do tend to be a little too self-contained for their own good, but the sheer variety in head bobbing dubby undercurrents present throughout the disc makes for another keeper."
2,Not The Best,"As some of the other comments go, the only story worth reading in this book was the one written by Nora Roberts. Her story was great, the others . . . not so much. I struggled to finish the other stories in the book and considered it a huge accomplishment when I was finally done reading it. As a whole the book is definitely not the best."
3,Nora's the Winner,The only reason this one has 3 stars is Nora Roberts. The other three stories were a struggle to get through. I've read their other collaborations and figured this one would be equally great. I was wrong!!!!! Save your money. Borrow it from a friend or the library.
2,What a disappointment!,"I was very excited when I found this book at the store. I am a huge fan of paranormal and absolutely adore Nora Roberts. Well, Nora's story was the only one that held my interest, and that was even kind of pushing it. The main problem with these books that have multiple stories and authors is that you never get a chance to really get into it when the story is only 70-100 pages. The three other authors were huge disappointments and I can say honestly that I will not be looking for their books in the future. I would definitely not reccomend this book to anyone, and would suggest that you not waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. I bought it on the basis of the Nora Roberts story and it turned out to be the only one worth reading in the collection. I totally applaud Ms. Roberts efforts to help new authors but surely the bar should be a bit more equal? I felt ripped-off, so I'll donate the book to the library so people can read it without buying it."
5,Lover of books,"I have read the other review entries, and I have to disagree with some of them. I am an avid fan of Nora Roberts, and the other authors she coincides with. I have read all of their short story collections, and have loved every one of them! When I saw this book, I grabbed it off the shelf, and haven't thought twice about it. I do agree with the others that Nora's story was the best, but 'Moon Shadows' wouldn't be the same without the stories from Gregory, Ryan-Langan, and Willman. They are all great others in their own rite. I am looking forward for the next book in this short story series!"
4,Wonderful!,"The author has written many stories about Scotland & the people within that are subtly or not so, interconnected. The scenery descriptions are glorious, but more than that she really writes about the emotional aspects of these intertwined characters. This particular book (in my opinion) brings the entire entourage of these stories to a wonderful conclusion."
5,"Love to ""Jam"" to my Kids' Music","My children thoroughly enjoy listening to the voices of kids sing these contemporary christian songs. As for me, I enjoy it, too. I don't feel as if I've sacrificed quality for kid-friendliness."
5,Incredible poster!,"I ordered this and other classic band posters for my teens room, and it looks so amazing! Love the band, love the poster!"
4,classic rock image,"very symbolic rock image, now I can see something seemed with Iron maiden and Fligth 666"
2,Bad Service,The poster is great but the service was bad. They waited to long to ship the poster &it did not arrive on time.
5,"A well known expert on OCD writes a simple, step by step guide on how to treat OCD","Dr. Munford, a member of the OCF Scientific Advisory Board; has written an important book, useful for both clinicians and clients alike. I found this book invaluable in helping me direct my treatment for people with contamination fears. I've recommended it to parents who find it helpful in understanding what Exposure and Ritual Prevention is. It gives clear, simple, step by step instruction on how to gradually face OCD fears. Whereas, other books tell you about OCD, this book tells you how to treat OCD. Priceless!!"
1,BORING!,"OK - I just bought 4 books from this series and not one of them was that interesting. My daughter is almost 4 and she loves for me to read to her, but these books are so boring I doubt she'll be requesting these often. I don't know why they get such high points from other reviews."
4,Love these books!,I had these books when I was a child and decided to buy them for my child. Not many books and tv shows these days have a lesson learned at the end or any type or moral significance so it's always good to go back to the classics.
5,Truly a good story,"All children like to do things ""All By Themselves"" as they grow and learn. this story is universal in it's appeal tochildren as young as 2My 3 year old nephew loved it."
3,Good book but read The Memoirs of Cleopatra first.,In this book it tells you about cleopatra's life and hardships. It is mostly of her adult life and her affairs with Marc antony and Ceasar. It was a good book but I highly reccommend Margret George's THE MEMOIRS OF CLEOPATRA. It is better written and much more captivating. But if you have already read that book then you might find comparing tho two enjoyable.All in all it was an ok book.
2,400 pages too long,"When I started reading this book I was rather optimistic. However, after the first 100 pages I feel I learned nothing new about the characters. The description of Cleopatra maturing from an adolescent that had just become the sovern of Egypt to a becoming a confident ruler was interesting. However, the remaining 400 pages of the novel just had her going back and forth like a ping-pong ball, between trusting Caesar to being betrayed by Caesar, to trusting Caesar to being betrayed by Caesar. (Actually, for the last 200 pages it was Mark Antony that she was trusting and being betrayed by, but he seems to be interchangable with Caesar for the purposes of this novel.) It became exasperating that Cleo couldn't seem to remember anything from more than 5 pages back. In the end, I feel the time spent reading this book was mostly wasted."
1,"Oh, please.....","I had high hopes for this book, as I am a lover of historical fiction, particularly Roman. The first few pages seemed to support my hope, but then . . . My advice is to save your money. The book is a juvenile piece of literature, full of inconsistent behavoir by the main characters and a decided anti-Roman perspective. On the whole the author's portrayal of Romans is , at best, one dimensional and harshly judgemental. There is no depth to the story, no richness to the prose, no enthralling historical detail, just a bunch of words on a page. I made myself finish it as I forked over $25 for it, but suffice to say there are numerous better written historical fiction books out there. Thankfully."
3,Page-Turner,"I agree--this book is a page-turner. It did, as many historical novels should do, encourage me to brush up my history and so I returned to Suetonius (what a lively gossip) and Tacitus and Plutarch (don't be put off by the names, they too write entertaining history) -- and I found that there were some parts of the Antony/Cleopatra story which I felt were opportunities lost. On the other hand, I enjoyed the imaginative sections--eg Cleopatra's voyeuristic introduction to sex. All in all a great read, terrific descriptions (the library at Alexander is superb) but a trifle too dramatic for the purist. But for leisure reading--highly recommended. One final thing--I think the Australian (Random House) version has a better cover...Don't underestimate the attraction of the cover..."
3,Not phenominal but a good book,"At first I almost put the book down. The author seems to want to display his in depth knowledge of egyptian vocabulary and in doing so turns half of his early writing into a vocabulary lesson- which i hate- it interupts the flow of the novel. But after a bit he settles into a flow. This book is fairly good, but a bit long for his contense. It's part military strategy and a little bit romance. Not really a good fix for an egyptophile, but I DO enjoy the realistic way in which he spins the tale of Cleopatra presenting herself to Cesear in a carpet. Often its a magnificent unraveling to a beautiful Isis...Falconer's portrayal is a bit more likely. my overall opinion of this book is tepid. Not a bad read, but i probably couldve found better."
4,Read this one AND Margaret George,"Although The Memoirs of Cleopatra is my ALL time favorite book of the Queen of Egypt, I have to admit that this is a very good book.My advice would be to spread these reads apart. Whichever one you read first you will take as GOSPEL for a very long time so read one, read a lot of books in between, and then read the other."
3,Entertaining Romp in Ancient Egypt and Rome,"Who doesn't have preconceptions about the famous/infamous Cleopatra and her legendary beauty? Thanks to Elizabeth Taylor and Claudette Colbert before her, we have been swamped with images and myths about the woman and her men. Falconer has written a sumptuous (though I suspect less than totally accurate historically) tale of the woman who nearly brought Rome to its knees. Most fascinating to me was the less than reverent depiction of Mark Antony, and a glimpse inside the corridors of power in both Rome and Egypt at that time. The details are exquisite - from Antony and Cleopatra's first meeting to their sensual couplings, to the final drama which claimed their lives - Falconer conjures a world where one strong woman almost toppled an empire. A great summer/beach read, just don't take it too seriously as far as history goes."
2,Disappointing...,"... especially when compared with ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra,"" as so many people are doing. This book has some characterizations I did like -- namely, Caesarion as a spoiled palace brat and Antyllus as an insecure, awkward teen -- but the rest of it seems pretty lacking. Half the book seems to be sex scenes that might as well have come from some trashy teen romance novel, and Antony and Cleopatra are just too one-dimensional to be enjoyable. Check this one out from the library first, or borrow it from somebody, before you spend money on it."
2,Lifeless characters - interesting background detail,"Although I found that reading this book was useful in terms of obtaining interesting information about historical Egypt, the background of the Egyptian royal line and some information about battles of the time, the characters themselves were hardly captivating. None of the characters seemed real or alive and although the storyline itself was interesting, I did not feel drawn into their experiences in any way. The sexual descriptions were fairly graphic in a somewhat disturbing, rather than sensual, way and did little to add to the story except in terms of sensationalizing the ""outrageous"" behavior of the characters. The author is clearly not adept at writing from a female perspective, which seems necessary to carry off a work of this type.Overall I would not recommend reading this book."
2,Poor characters,"While the author's historic detail is fair, why are we supposed to care about any of these characters? Almost every one of them, up to and including Cleopatra, Caesar and Anthony, are shallow and unlikable. I started to root for the suicide at the end."
2,a blatant margaret george [copy],"How to describe this...?The words stilted, one-dimensional, ... come to mind. Oh, make no mistake -his prose is pretty interesting, but it ultimately falls out in character development. His characters come off as caricatures (Cleopatra as a sexette, Caesar as a barbaric sugardaddy, Mark Anthony as a buffoon, etc) speaking in soap-opera dialogue, and the better descriptions are heavily borrowed from Margaret George's ""Memoirs of Cleopatra"". The latter is a MUCH better book -longer, but more interesting. If you're in a limbo over which to read, pick the second."
5,Cleopatra Enthusiasts,I've always been fascinated with Cleopatra and tend to eat up literature and film on the subject matter. I have to say there was just something very special about this book to me. I found it well written with an excellent flow. I just couldn't put it down and then when it was over I felt a sense of loss. It's Cleopatra in a whole new way.
2,"Wooden characters, lacked interest","I read this novel and read the Margaret George novel on Cleopatra right after. There is no comparison. Whereas George's characters have depth, Falconer's are one-dimensional. Would it really be possible for Antony to have been the total drunk portrayed here and have accomplished what he did? Would Cleopatra really have been attracted to such a lout? She seems too smart for that - but not in this book. The characters in this book are so lacking in depth and likable qualities I felt like I was just waiting for them to all die.The novel also lacked the richness of detail that attracts me to (good) historical novels and allows me to feel as though I am there - a witness to history. There are several good novels about Cleopatra. Why bother to read this one?I put this book down several times before I finished it - then I sold it back to the used book store."
3,Just Average,"Nothing stands out about this thing. Everything is plain and unimpressive. The tool has a real nice presentation to it but that is just about it.The construction is cheap and it is quite heavy. The handles were not put together properly so they are crooked. The blades are very sharp.The knife is short and dulls easily. None of the tools lock in place, so be wary of it closing in on you. Pliers are nice and works ok. The wire cutter is junk, they dented on the first time I tried them.I pretty much use it as a glorified screw driver. The bits that come with it are very useful. They cover most everything that is out there. They are held in very shakey so expect to be constantly reattaching them. It just a real nuisance.I am replacing this with a leatherman.This is a tool that isn't going to make me cry when it breaks or is lost. Don't expect for this thing to save your life in a pinch and don't cry when it breaks."
2,Nail breaker!,"This very clever and attractive tool has three major drawbacks:1. It is very hard to open the knives/screwdrivers, etc., without breaking a finger or thumbnail. There is no access point provided for the fingernail grooves in the acessory blades, and they are extremely tight. A hard object, such as a screwdriver, will help to get them open - - - (But why carry a screwdriver to get at your ....screwdriver?)2. The sharp cutting edges of the knife blade and serrated blade rest against metal stops when closed. This can't be good for them.3. Opening the serrated blade pulls out the other accessories on that side. This is convenient, but: Among them is a very nice, sharp, short blade. Closing the unwanted accessories presents the risk of cutting yourself.These drawbacks make the knife a poor choice."
5,"IRON MAN ,BLACK WIDOW AND CAPTAIN AMERICA","I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE ITS AWSOME ANDTHE ACTION IS REALLY COOL MY FAVORITES ARE IRON MAN , BLACK WIDOW AND CAPTAIN AMERICA BECAUSE IRON MAN IS TUFF CAP AMERICA RISK HIS LIFE FOR EVERY ONE AND BLACK WIDOW SAVES THE DAY IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR AN WRITTEN INVITION GO AHEAD TRY IT"
1,Adaptation...What....You're Joking Right?,"All I'm gonna say is thanks again Lions Gate for totally butchering something that I truely love. Now maybe you'll call me a fangirl picking the movie apart. Well whatever, if you accept this as a good movie you need to go back and re-read the book cause obviously you missed something. ""The Ultimates"" is about alot more than just re-introducing the Avngers to the younger generation. This movie completely miss's that. Oh and as far as all you Amazonian's out there giving this a good review and telling others to ignore the bad ones, you're exactly the people Lions Gate is banking on rushing right out to buy this without first reading reviews. This movie might maybe be worth renting on the Avengers name alone, however anyone looking for The Ultimates here should go back and re-read the books, because there's nothing Ultimate about this movie(aside from Ultimate Marvel Sell-Out)at all."
1,"Hey Marvel, Hire An Editor","I love the Avengers and really looked forward to this movie. Sadly, it is about as interesting as a Saturday morning cartoon. What really annoyed me was the lack of interest Marvel shows in this product. If you turn on the subtitles - which are really pop-up notes about the characters and such - it is painfully obvious nobody edited the text. It just makes the movie look all the more cheap and rushed.Come on Marvel, you can do better than this dreck."
4,4 1/2 Stars Captain America Iron Man Nick Fury match whits,"Great follow-up, including with the animation to Marvels recent live action Spiderman, X-Men, Daredevil, Hulk, Punisher, and so on. What great exhibition of Marvel Comics favorites Captain America, Iron Man, and intro for those less familiar with Nick Fury, Wasp, Giant Man and the like. For an animated film there's a lot personality and attitude in each superhero. The final showdown with Hulk is the keeper, especially with about 70 min total running time. Stay tooned!!! Those familiar Marvel Comics ""Guest Star"" volumes or the Capcom Arcade tournament game, watching Hulk vs. Giant Man, Hulk vs. Wasp and Captain America, are the highly anticipated dream scenario."
5,Ultimate Avengers - The Movie,"If you loved, still love, comics; this is for you. It takes the static images of the Marvel world and brings them to dynamic life. All of the Avengers are well represented here. The only thing that might compete would be the much anticipated live action film planned for the not to distant future."
1,A complete waste buy the BOOK!,"The trade paper back was excellent what Marvel did here was take all of the character development, internal struggles, and just about all the debth to the story and threw it out the window and taked on an alien conspiracy to make more action (because pretty explosions is the only thing we need to make a good movie right?).Buy the book, movies like this is what makes comics still look bad. worst adaptation of the year. Quality control people."
3,it's ok,"I'm a -huge- fan of super hero cartoons; 90's X-Men, Batman, Batman Beyond, Superman, Justice League. Due to the mixed reviews here, I decided to rent this movie instead of purchasing it, and I'm glad I did this. It was okay to watch the first time, but for me its re-watch value is very low. I have no desire to own it. The first half of the movie moved very slow. I would've enjoyed it better if the characters and story didn't seem so bland. It didn't have that 'magic' or excitement the cartoons I listed in the beginning have."
4,Don't listen to anyone,"No one knows anything about this movie. It hasn't been released yet. Either wait for it to come out THEN read the reviews, or just buy it.There was an article in Wizard Magazine about this. They (producers) said they wanted to keep the movie as close to the comic as possible. Some things were changed (like Giant Man being naked) to avoid problems with parents or the FCC or something like that. But in general, it's supposed to be much like the comic. Screen shots were also featured in the article, they were almost mirror images of the comic book panels. So maybe it will be a lot like it. Even if it's not exactly like it, I'm getting it anyway because I'm a fan of Marvel, The Avengers, and The Ultimates."
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"I wish Amazon.com would allow for half-star ratings. The Ultimate Avengers Collection doesn't quite fall into what I consider 2-Star territory but it's certainly below a middle-of-the-road 3 Star average.These two films had a lot of potential but they just never delivered. It felt like I was watching a seriously edited version of a longer story that felt rushed and inconsistent. If you're not already familiar with the characters this isn't going to do much for you. The only real back story that's provided is on Captain America and The Black Panther. The other characters get little (if any) exposition on their origins powers. The animation seems oddly inconsistent as well; in some places the quality is very good and in others it's sloppy, poorly shaded, and just plain boring.I'm disappointed that Marvel seems unable to produce animated features of the same quality as DC has been able to do in recent years."
4,Nice combination of Marvel classics,"Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and Hulk star amongst other larger than life superheros in this animated comic book story of a long brewing battle between Capain America and Nazi sympathizers, who also happen to be aliens. Animated and running around 70 minutes, this tight little story does not leave much to some of the character development, but does have plenty of action, and a strong enough plot to keep it movie along. There are just a few sub-plots to spice things up. I thought the animation was adequate, kept with a comic book feel, and managed to get dark enough when needed. I hope the second edition is as good as the first."
3,A Valiant attempt,"Any viewer of this film should be aware of the source,a series of fairly adult graphic novels from a few years back.Marvel takes the WATCHMEN approach to it's own characters and does a fabulous job.That said,the movie should have been twice as longto get enough character development in,and possibly more of that real-world material.Is the animation good? yes. Is it as good as Warner or the average Japanese flick? no.but it's worth buying.I'll be looking out for more.I hope they read these reviews,and make the right choice."
1,Nice try Marvel,"This is yet another attempt for Marvel comics to sell their toy line. the weak stary and sub par animation left this movie wanting more time for action and less on everything else they did. If you're a fan of comic movies then dont waste your money. instead watch ""Justice League Unlimited"" on cartoon Network Saturdays at 10:30 for free. They fit more into a half hour show, story and action wise then the so called Feature Length film of Marvel."
5,Excellent Marvel Movie,This is the best non cgi anumated movie I've seen in awhile. A must for any Marvel Fan. It's worth the money for just the ending battle sequence alone. It's not too kiddy and will apeal to young and old. After seeing this I'm now getting number two!!!
1,Only recommend this to your worst enemies!,"I have never had my intelligence so thoroughly insulted in my entire life. Throughout this entire pile of garbage, it was as if I was being assailed by Thor's mighty hammer of extreme stupidity. Not fit for children of any age - partly because there is some killing, but mainly so you don't lower the IQ of your kids."
3,Ultimate Avengers made better by Bluray,"Most agree that the story was bad for this animated release. I personally think part 1 was bearable, but 2 was close to unwatchable. What I DO however like about this release, is the quality Bluray brings. Those who tell you animation wont be enhanced by hi def? Show them this. Crisp lines, and solid colors all around. Very impressive to watch visually. And the sound was incredible. I only use the two speakers on my TV, but the sound that came out of this release was still pretty amazing, leaps and bounds over my regular DVDs."
2,Maybe for kids,"As an adult reader of comics who loves The Ultimates, I have to say that this movie was quite a disappointment. The animation was surprisingly cheesy, reminding me more of the old Spiderman and His Amazing Friends than X-Men: Evolution. The story was confusing and lacked the wit and style of the comics. If the goal was to attract children to comics, then maybe the choices to dumb down the material and save on the animation costs make sense. If Marvel wants to find another way into the wallets of adult comic-lovers, though, I think it made a big mistake."
2,New but not improved,"This animated crossbreed of the original Avengers and Mark Millar's remarkable reincarnation The Ultimates fails both titles equally. It lacks the both earnest charm of the original comic as well as the Matrix-esque glitz and gusto that makes The Ultimates one of the most readable and cleverly modern comics published today. Additionally, the special features fall short with a long winded (and inexplicably Millar-less) documentary on the Avengers past, present and future that would bore even the least discriminating fan boy to tears."
4,Bad storyline but good ending!,"I watched this animated movie many times and would really give it 3 and a half starts. The storyline was not so good which involved mainly stopping the Red Skull and an alien invasion of Earth. The ending of this movie was the best action part. It involved the Hulk badly beating up Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and this other guy who can grow into a giant. Like someone said earlier, if you're a Incredible Hulk fan, you'll love the ending of this movie!"
5,BEST MARVEL ANIMATED YET !!,"I own all four animated Marvel movies (Iron Man - Dr. Strange - Avengers) and this one is the best by far ! Not only does it move on from explaining the origin of each superheroe like the others -which of course was a necessary thing to do since not everyone is a Marvel connaisseur - it also teams up the avengers in a smashing way for non-stop action ! Pity they had to kill one the minor charachters at the end but it did give it a dramatic turn one wouldn't expect from these kind of non-rated films.The animation is near-perfect, razor-sharp picture, great colors and all and the sound, if lacking a little bottom end for the sound effects like explosions, gunshots , thuds and thumps on the 2.0 mix is superb anyway, and mega-loud to boot !Please Marvel Studios keep pumping these highly collectable little pieces of animated superheroe-action !!!"
2,Why was this so....,"Disappointing? Cartoons animated for DC Comic super heros is far more better than this production. No disrespect to Stan and family but step up your game, please. Marvel has some of the best super heros but some of the crapiest animation."
3,Feh.,"For all the hype, I could have seen a much better movie.Much better suited to Saturday Mornings than a treasured space on my DVD shelf.It was too different from the Ultimates to be a good adaptation of that, and too different from the Avengers to be a good representation of that.The included documentary was good, with a great extended interview with Avengers artist extraordinaire George Perez. But I was struck by how much fun I remembered Perez' books being. Remember when comics were fun (and funny?) Something lacking in The Ultimates, the current Avengers books and this DVD.Too bad."
4,Good little movie,"I really enjoyed this little movie. It's a little cheap in that it's barely 70 minutes long, and you don't really get a lot of development out of any of the characters (mostly Captain America). Banner has been reduced to a bit of a whiny character, which is unfortunate. However, it is still really enjoyable. Admission - I know little about any of the history of these characters, and don't know what was tampered with and what wasn't. The DVD has a preview of the sequel, and I'm already looking forward to it. I hope that they keep 'em coming."
4,Underrated Ultimates!,"Another chapter in Marvel's Superhero universe sees the Ultimates spinning off from the comic book into their own movie. Expect some differences from the comic and if you're a classic Avengers fan, my advice is: open your mind. This isn't your uncle's Avengers anymore.Overall, this is a well put together animated feature - some of the animation initially looks limited (still equal or better to any japanese anime) but the action is well storyboarded and the climactic battle with the Hulk is as good as any animated action scene I've seen. Tightly paced, well characterised - nice sound effects - I enjoyed it. Yes, it could've been longer, but that's what sequels are for.This cartoon doesn't deserve the flak it's getting from some reviewers here. Enjoy it but note that it's definitely more PG-13...get something more suitable like Disney for your kids..."
4,I liked...,"I got exactly what I expected. The animation could have been a touch better, but it has a good story and great feel. I would like to see a few more Marvel animated movies soon..."
3,Good movies - OK blu-ray,"The movies themselves earn a solid 4 stars - the first would get 5 and the second would get 3 since the second one is essentially the same story as the first (first fight aliens, then fight hulk).I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the blu-ray though. My wife and I have several animated Marvel and DC movies (Green Lantern, Superman/Batman PE, Planet Hulk, etc...) on blu-ray and they're beautiful, very crisp and vivid. These movies are lacking a little in the crisp and vivid department. I doubt it's because both movies are on one disc - a blu-ray should have more than enough space for two shorter movies and still have a better picture quality.It's not bad, and the price isn't terrible, but unless you're trying to get more blue cases on your shelf, maybe stick with DVD and the upconvert?"
2,Ultimate Avengers - The Movie review,Thought is would be much better. I was very dissappointed. Only interesting part of the entire movie was Capt. America's past story line. The current and past JLA have much better writting and animation.
2,"Mediocre, typical Marvel cinema","This was a disappointment. Considering they had brilliant source material and a model for successful comic adaptation to animation (DCs properties) the only excuse for this pedestrian knockoff is a cash grab. The animation is mediocre 1980s Saturday morning, the direction is artless and the story is just a timid outline of what it could have been. Dull. I don't know what's more insulting; teasing the audience with Hitch's illustrations in the end credits or the Special Features material where Avi and company gush about how hard they worked bringing the book to life. I suspect the only envelope they pushed was with schedule and budget. It's a rushed, empty affair that with fit in well with the rest of Marvel's cinematic offerings."
4,pretty good...,"i'm not sold on reinventing nick fury for the newer generations (who the hell really thinks samuel l. jackson is cool anyway? he's a grandstanding guy desperate for attention, par for the course for his profession), i think it would be better to just introduce new characters rather than alter famous old characters. but that'd be too much work i guess, marvel and dc haven't been great cauldrons of ideas in, oh i don't know, 30 years or so?back to the ultimate avengers, it's a good comic book movie. i'm just a 616 fan who doesn't really like the ultimate universe idea."
5,First Ultimat Avengers movie review,I found the story very entertaining. After seeing the 2nd movie first I found I liked the 2nd movie a lot better. The cartoon action was jerky at times on this movie and the action figures appeared to be drawn at times in the wrong perspective.
2,NOT for Thor fans,"It dragged a bit, not a whole lot of action. More Nick Fury than anything else. Cap was OK, Iron Man was mediocre, but that was about it. Thor was majorly disappointing. Thor came off as some beer drinking wierdo with very little presense in the film. And what's up with Hulk picking up Mjollnir and using it against Thor?? WRONG!!!! NO ONE ELSE CAN PICK UP HIS HAMMER!!!!!!! Thor should have been kicking major butt, but not here. Thor is the GOD OF THUNDER, show him that way!"
1,Great -- if you like wearing your coffee instead of drinking it..,"I received this mug yesterday as a replacement for an old one that I loved but had begun leaking. I took it home, hand-washed it per the directions included, and was ready to use it this morning for the coffee that gets me through my morning commute.Imagine my surprise when I went to taste my coffee and found that suddenly I was wearing it due to an apparent leak between the lid and the cup itself. I tried dumping the coffee (or what was left) out and filling the cup with water to test it out, and replaced the lid, being sure to tighten it up to remove user error. This had no helpful effect at all. Almost everything in the mug came pouring out when I tilted the cup even very slightly sideways.I have initiated a return with Amazon, and will seek a better mug elsewhere."
3,challenging,It is definetely a book for your scraps. Has lots of exciting patterns.Some remind one of the old vintage quilts.
4,Bolan on the Verge of Electric,"This newly issued remaster of the first T Rex album is available in the UK only--and that's a shame. The album captures Bolan moving from the acoustic Tyrannosaurus Rex sound to the T Rex pop-rock sound that would make him famous. Very good to excellent tunes of both varieties plus bonus of the great breakthrough single ""Ride a White Swan"" backed with ""Summertime Blues."" Also alternate takes. Buy this one--not the remaster issued in the '90s without the bonus tracks. Great sound."
2,Bust-Up and put in the trash,"First off, it's tiny. The toy is literally three inches high, and does nothing. While it's cute (we bought the Bart/Raven model), it sits on a shelf and collects dust. Wheeeee.If you're a completist Simpsons collector, then by all means, spend the cash. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
5,Great IPod Dock,"This IHome was easy to install and sounds GREAT in my medium sized kitchen. I love the remote. The IPod stores in the unit and does not hang down. I don't get every radio station, but enough to keep me happy."
3,Shipping costs are ridiculous.,"This appears to be a great product, but paying $112.00 for shipping is ridiculous! Look for the iHome IH36W model instead, as the cost is better and there's free super saver shipping (Note: The IH36W is white, not black, but for $153.00 difference I can live with the white model!)"
2,no radio reception,sound is fine for Ipod music. The radio stations do not come in. One local station tunes to all. Our $20 Boom box gets better reception!
5,So nice I needed it in black,"A great little unit. I had one in white, but needed it in white after remodelling the kitchen. Nice sound. Have the ability to push clear sound while still going fairly loud."
4,Student of Marchall Ho'o,"I learned tai chi chuan from Marshall in the late '60. I became an instructor and have continued practicing over the subsequent years. If you have no prior experience with tai chi this is a good place to start. You will learn the correct external form of the Yang large style. This is just the 27 short form but you will have enough grounding so you can begin to learn the 108 long form in the future if desired.There is a great deal more to be learned than can be given in this short video,I still have original VHS, but I find myself coming back to it every now and then to refresh my memory of the patient and good friend that Marshall became. You will not learn the internal mechanics or energy circulation from this DVD but that is something to look forward to...tai chi chuan is a life long and very beneficial practice.For those who wish more advanced material I recommend Bruce FrantzisBagua and Tai Chi: Exploring the Potential of Chi, Martial Arts, Meditation and the I Ching."
1,Looks like it came out of a quarter machine,"I bought this ring because I wanted something I could wear all the time and not worry about losing it or damaging it. The design is a good idea and had potential but the center stone is too big and it is set in a way that makes it look like it came from a quarter machine. It has a ""childs ring"" look to it. It's sparkles beautifully I just don't like the way it sits. It just looks fake! They also don't fit ""together"" as closely as I think they should. Maybe it's just my taste, but I don't like anything about it. A lot of others think it's perfect. Just depends on what you like."
2,Wedding Band Set,Looks better online than in person.Very disappointed with the lack of sparkle.Stones look really cloudy /fake.Did come in a very nice ring box.Should have spent a little more to get a little more.
1,Be aware before you buy,When I googled VCR/DVD player with tuner the Amazon website comes up and if you click on the link this product is one that is in the grouping of VCR/DVD players that should have a tuner BUT it does not. I was further deceived because this is the replacement model for the unit I have that does have a tuner built in. Upon receiving the product and reading on the outside of the box I could see this was not what I was wanting to purchase. I had to send it back at my expense and there is still a 10% restocking fee even if unopened. Not like returning something to a local store.
2,Cannot Record Without Cable Box,"The Sony DVD/VCR Combo Player SLV-281P has a fine picture and like most Sony products is well constructed. However, you must have a cable box in order to record on VHS tapes (it only plays DVDs).I called Comcast, our cable company, and they confirmed that while those receiving cable without boxes WILL get digital TV in February, they WILL NOT be able to record off devices that don't have tuners -- and the Sony SLV-281P does not have one. Comcast suggested waiting until February, when such units will have digital tuners that will accept its COAX without a cable box. By the way, the seller charged me the 8.54% Los Angeles sales tax, but when I returned the unit I was refunded only the 7.50% sales tax that is in effect where I live. Watch out!"
1,Has no tuner!,"I really wish I'd read the user reviews of this product before purchasing, because nowhere in the the product description is it mentioned that there's no tuner. This means that it will only record what the TV or cable box is tuned to. Not good. I had to return the item shortly after hooking it up."
1,Frustrated,"I agree with a previous reviewer..It's pretty ridiculous that you have to wait until you open the box to find out that this DVD/VCR Combo will not record videos on tape unless you have a cable box or satellite receiver....as usual, you get what you pay for..."
5,Y's everyone hatin,"its a great cds to get you pumped up and blast out the car or work out to, anyone buying it expecting great lyrical talent is retarded"
4,Not huge on crunk but gotta give jon props,"Iv always been a fan of lil jons beats, but felt like when he makes a full length album it tends to get repetitive. This isnt the case with this album though. He is deinately showing growth in his beats with this album. Has some slow, some where the bass hits hard, and he has some outstanding guests this time around.Fav Tracks-1.Grand Finale2.Lovers and Friends3.White Meat4.Get Crunk5.Contract"
4,The Kings of Crunk is back At Cha,This cd is great.......but not greater than Kings Of Crunk. So far the songs i can listen to is:Real N***a Roll Call (best song on the cd)Lovers And FriendsIn Da Club (R.kelly & Luda)Awww Skeet Skeet[...] Aint S**h
1,thank god this pathetic album is finally out of print,this album is a complete joke all lil jon does on this album is yell and screams he has no talented neither do his two fat bodyguards they have zero talent as well drinking from a thing you put oil in gross all i know is that these idiots who made this worthless album are going nowhere speacil crunk music officially died in 2005my taste in music is awesome but lil jon always fails at everything
1,Yawn.,"Boring and pointless. Scream ""YEAAAAAAAAAH"" and ""WHAAAAAAAT"" a million times while someone else is rapping and you got a hit for the year. Yawn.If you listen to garbage like Lil Jon, get a clue."
1,You Gotta Be kiddin' me!?,"I didn't think it was legal to f%# up hip hop as much as Lil' John do. Crunk should be illegal, it makes you sick. This cd says it all: EVERY TRACK are the same. theres slightly any difference in the beat, and the verses are all bad as hell. Even Grand Finale feat. Jadakiss, NaS, Ice Cube, Bun B & T.I. are so bad, that it makes you think: ""who can f#& up a track featuring NaS?"" the answer is = Lil' John!And then The Source Magazine crowns Lil' John as the best producer of 2005! that really lowered their standart.All in all: This is a violation of hip hop, a rape of a proud culture.track 1-19: 0/10track 20: 2/10it shouldn't be necessary to say anything more about this album.instead, check out ""Late Registratiion"", Immortal Technique, Non Phixion, Outkast, Common, Gang Starr, R.A. The Rugged Man, Jedi Mind Tricks, Jay-Z, NaS..... the REAL Mc's in their league."
1,Definition of Trash,"I Can't Take It Anymore! Rap Has Hit An All Time Low...It's Been That Way For A Looooooooooong Time Now..All The Good Rappers Have Deals With Koch And All The Crap Rappers Have Deals With Major Labels..The Difference? The Good Rappers Don't Get Enough Exposure As They Should..It's Pathetic...Take Lil' Jon For Example..He Just Released Another In-Your-Face Collection of Crappy Lyrics Over Tin-Can Beats...On An Album!!! This Is Not What Rap Is Supposed To Be!!!!! What Happened To The Days of Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt And Life After Death? They're Gone...Traded In For A Brat Pack Of Low-Life Rappers Such As Cash Money And No Limit...If You Call This Classic..Check Yourself Into A Hospital Because You Are Not Sane Anymore!!!"
1,OK!!??,What is this crap? I dont know but the constant word yyyyeeeeaaahhh!!!! is heard over and over and over. this is pure crap!
1,Lil Jon and the rehab clinic,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul."
2,,"I'm very disappointed with Lil Jon at this album. When I first heard Wat U Gon Do, I was sure that the album would be hot. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good tracks on the cd, but not many. Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz always throw in a couple of skits/interludes or as i say ""space fillers"" they really could of left out. So to sum this up, if you're a true fan of them, you'll get this cd.If I had the choice of getting it, I would of just burnt it from a friend instead of wasting my money on it. I say download it if you really want it."
1,"Pointless, talentless, worthless, etc...","Wow, I'm must say that lil jon has attained a level of suck few can match. He hasn't an ounce of talent, for rap or anything else, in his entire body. I pity the fools who wasted money on this ""music"". Your time would be better spend smacking your head on a brick wall! Truly this deserves a negative score but as I am unable to award it such, one star will have to do."
2,hmmm,"alright this album is mediocre at best.I mean, some songs are good if youre in a bad mood (what they gon' do?); lovers and friends and in da club are koo. besides these the album is mostly...""YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"" ""WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT?"" ""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY"" and LOTS AND LOTS OF profanity. seeriously i dont mind profanity but this goes beyond the limit with ""mofo"" in every 2 seconds of verse. just listen to the songs from this album that are on the radio, those are the only good ones"
4,dont dis this cd!!!!!!!,dis is a really crunked out cd. alot of people diss on lil jons cds. dat f*ckin stupid!lil jon in my opinion is da crunkest rapper out there!(even though hes not really a rapper)he said hes not a rapper thats why he has all these crunk azz rappers on his cds!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,too much crunk juice for lil jon,ima be real with you this cd has about 5-6 songs worth listenin to besides that you have to listen to about a thousand annoying ass skits from corny ass chris rock bohagon chyna wyte dave chappelle by the time you get to the songs your ready to throw this cd away my advice either download this or if you bought itspeed up to about 60 mph on the highway roll down yah window and toss this disc aggressively onto the road cuz thas what it was made for or maybe you take a cold drank and place this disk below it or put out a cigarette with this disc anything but playing it ......i was a lil jon fan for 5 years before this now i guess imma go buy sumden else
4,LIL' JON IZ DA CRUNK KING BUT NOT OF DA DURTY SOUTH,LIL' JON SHOWS HE THE FIRST TO BE THE KING OF CRUNK AND HE DOIN' IT GOOD WITH THE EASTSIDE BOYZTHE SONG IN THIS CRUNK JUICE ARE:CRUNK JUICE (SKIT)GET CRUNK 9/10WHAT U GON' DO 10/10REAL N**** ROLL CALL 10/10BO HAGON'S PHONE CALL (SKIT)DA BLOW 8/10CONTRACT 9/10E40 CHOPPIN' (SKIT)WHITE MEAT 9.5/10STOP F***IN' WIT ME 8/10CHRIS ROCK LET'S BE FRIENDS (SKIT)LOVERS & FRIEND 10/10ONE NIGHT STAND 8.5/10AWW SKEET SKEET 8/10CHRIS ROCK IN THE CLUB (SKIT)IN THE CLUB 10/10B****ES AIN'T S*** 9.5/10CHRIS ROCK GET LOWER (SKIT)STICK THAT THANG OUT (SKEEZER) 9.5/10GRAND FINALE 10/10
4,I don't see what is wrong..,"Lil Jon is still a great producer. You take the beats, and you don't look into the lyrics. With that said, songs like ""Real N*gga Roll Call"" suck. But half of the joints on this album warrant replays. ""White Meat"" is tight (with 8ball and MJG). ""Grand Finale"" features some great rappers like Nas and Bun B and sports a nice beat. Smoother joints like ""In Da Club"" are nice too. If you hate Lil Jon, then don't get this CD. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid investment."
3,Party and Get Crunk,"This cd is all pretty much about getting crunk and partying and all that except for a few songs, I give lil jon credit though because he doesn't try to do too much with his limited lyrics like bone crusher and look what happened to him. Lil jon lets other people do most of the verses while he does the hooks, and lil jon is a good producer and comes through on this cd. But i cant give it more than three stars condsidering the cd is by lil jon and the eastside boys and they dont do alot of good rapping on this."
5,Always On Crunk Mode,"If you are down in the blue, need a little motivation or a little push to get your day started then I have the perfect remedy for you and that is to go out and buy the ""Crunk Juice"" Cd. This album has something for every mood, Whether you in for a smooth R&B ballad ""Loverz and Friends"" Or you just need to ""Get Crunk"". Lil Jon has done it again and is here to stay! Keepin' it gutter as always and Keepin' you crunk is his business, So ""What U Gon' Do?"" I""m gon tell you what I'm gon do, is sit back get me a glass of crunk juice and and listen to Crunk Juice. Why do anything else?"
4,Grows on You..,"When I first picked up this album,I skimmed through it and I was a little disappointed.I've finally listened to the entire album and there are a few cuts I like.This album is okay, and let me clear this up,I don't consider this rap.This is just for pure entertainment.So with that said,this album is hot if you like the down south ""crunk"" feel.I think their last album(Kings of Crunk) was better,but there are still some hot tracks.My personal favorites are:1. Crunk Juice (Intro)2. Get Crunk feat Bo Hagon3. What U Gon' Do feat Lil Scrappy6. Da Blow feat Gangsta Boo7. Contract feat Trillville, Jazze Pha & Pimpin Ken9. White Meat feat 8Ball & MJG12. Lovers & Friends feat Usher & Ludacris14. Aww Skeet Skeet feat DJ Flexx16. In The Club feat R. Kelly & Ludacris19. Stick That Thang Out (Skeezer) feat Pharrell Williams & Ying Yang Twins Produced by The Neptunes"
2,Afroman,Sink yo money into the new AFroman disks...He cares about his listeners and the music wontdisappoint. www.afromanmusic.com
1,Hate this!,Yo son this is not rap. this is a bunch of [...] put together in one. Tha [...] can't eva put out good rap music. I'm from where rap was made. so I nowat is good rap music.
1,I'm tired of the screamin,"This album is no different than the rest of his other ones. He always has himself say a phrase and his background boys repeat it in a loud and aggressive voice. I used to love rap, back when artist like UGK, Outkast, and Eightball & MJG ruled the airwaves. Now all this craze over crunk music has come and Lil John makes millions of dollars off of being crunk, which to me is another word for screaming and acting ignorant. I ain't hatin on him, but it just ain't real music and I will never buy a Lil John CD again, ever."
1,This is the crap I have to endure....,"Every time I visit my cousin's house. GOD does this crap suck. Some guy repeating the same crap over the same old Synthesized Bass line? If this is the future of music we're f**ked.Forget instruments, forget talent, forget melody, forget progression, forget scales, chords, we now have CRUNK."
1,This is not rap music....,"If you're looking for an album with deep lyrical content, you're in the wrong place. I would suggest artists like Common and Scarface if that is what you're seeking.Lil Jon creates ,what I would call, party/club music. It's quite obivous that Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz(Big Sam & Lil' Bo) can't write good lyrics or any at all, which is why that have artists like Ice Cube, Ludacris, Nas, Bun B and other various rap artists to do the majority of the rapping. Also, the skits in this album are rather pointless, it serves no purpose to the album. The only good songs are ""Grand Finale"" and ""Real Nigga Roll Call"". Everything else is just pure trash. I can't believe I even wasted my money on this."
1,terrible.... where are the good club songs....,"i swear... lil' john is the worst artist to date... he uses recycled beats to make another pointless song about beating people up, and he is sooooooo annoying with the ""WHAT?!s"" and the ""YEAH!s""....i cannot go to a club with out them playing a lil' john song.... PERIOD.... each song they play is his song or he produced it....crunk is going downhill and soon (and i hope real soon) that people can realise musis sux lately.... if people stop listening to crap all day and listen to real artist then the music business will come with real s#!+.....A LOAD OF CRAP!!!!!"
1,BOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DONT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M A BIG LIL JON AND THE EAST SIDE BOYZ FAN BUT WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUMI PUT IT ON MY CD PLAYER AND HEAR THE FIRST TRACK AND IT SUCKS SO I JUST HEAR THEM ALL SO I KNOW HOW THIS ALBUM CAN GET SUCKER LIL JON SUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCK NO COMMENT!!!!!!!!!! HOLLA!!!!!!!!
2,Why does Lil Jon tries to rap????,"I love to say I hate Lil Jon but I cant...I admit that I love Yeah!!, I like Goodies, I like Damn!!, I like Get Low, I like Salt Shaker.. I even kinda like What You Gonna Do..These songs has great beats and in songs like Lovers and Friends and One Night Stand, Lil Jon shows his skills in making R&B; songs..oh wait is it CRUNK&B...lol...;The problem is that I hate his voice. By repeating what you say and swearing a lot is not rap. Its not even singing. It stupid BullS#@$ that what it is. Lil Jon should stay his ass behind the music and be a production. I gotta say this LIL JON IS A GOOD PRODUCER BUT NOT A RAPPER...so get off the damn mic you are ruining the song.Heres a rap I wrote for Lil Jon...Why Do Lil Jon has to rap? Doesnt he know he is really bad?(repeat 4x)Why cant he stay as the music production and make bomb ass beat off music procession?(repeat 4x)1 Star for good beats1 Star for somehow convincing good rappers like Ice Cube to rhyme with a loser..."
1,Lil Jon - Lil Talent,"Okay let me get this straight. If I wear dreadlocks, throwback sports apparel, big sunglasses, put some radiators in my mouth, act drunk, and scream lame unintelligible raps I too can be a big star? Alas, there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof.Scuse me whilst I look for a bridge to leap from!"
1,Steer clear of this,"This is not real music. Lil Jon has no skill at all, and cannot rap. All he says is ""Yeah!"", ""what!"", and ""Okay!(not to mention the swears every other word). Just a word of advice, spend your money on other kinds of music: good rap, rock, or just about anything else. But, if you really like this mindless music, then it is well worth the money, because if you like one song, you'll like the rest."
1,This is not worth buying!,This is not worth buying at all its total trash if you buy this you would be throwing your money in the bin literally!!
4,"Nice, but Kings of Crunk was better.....","This is a great cd, but when it comes down to everything it just aint as strong as kings of crunk. I can name at laest 10 bangers on kings of crunk this cd has about 5. I mean no song on here really compares to the likes of Get Low, I dont give a f***, push that n**** push that hoe, knockin headz off or a few others. But this does have some good songs like what u gon do, roll call, grand finale, and a few others. I reccomend you get Kings of Crunk first if you dont have it already, then purchase this one. Keep comin with the crunkness."
4,A crunk a$$ cd,"This is a crunk cd no question i mean what else do you expect from the king of crunk. This cd got alot of hot jams and bangers especially ""roll call"" w/ice cube, and my favorite ""in da club"" w/R.kelly and ludacris. Lil jon even shows his soft side on the love ballad ""lovers and friends"" which is probably gonna be a smash hit if they release it as a video because it reunites lil jon with usher and ludacris. ""Grand Finale"" is also a great song which features nas,t.i.,jadakiss,bun b, and ice cube.Tight beats mostly but no substance in the lyrics which is why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 but who expects substance from lil jon?.But Overall a bangin cd for fans of crunk music. YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"
5,Back At It Again,"When I got this new album I thought to myself....Do I really want to hear more of Lil John's one liners? I loved Kings Of Crunk but what more could this dude say or do. Then I played it and asked myself again; Do I want to hear more of Lil John screaming simple lines over crazy beats? YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This album is off da hook probably better than Kings Of Crunk. The album is very diverse and experimental. I loved the song he did with Rick Rubin, that song is a mix of Crunk and Rock. In The Club is off the hook but I don't think it will be bigger than Yeah. Stick that Thang Out is dope. It sounds like a Rick James song. Grand Finale is straight fire except for Ice Cube. I'm not sure how he got on grand finale but they could have used someone else, maybe Pitbull.All in all Crunk Juice will not dissapoint. If you already hate Lil John you'll hate him more. OKAYYYYYYYY"
1,What the hell is this?,How on Earth did this ever get accepted as music? Just a bunch of idiots incoherently screaming over some stupid beat. I can't bear to image how bad the next music fad will be.
2,Rap went downhill,"Let me say that Lil Jon's trend is over. The ""YEA"", ""OKAY"", and ""WHAT"" is just annoying now. It is true that the there is a cuss word every second in songs. If you like you this kind of rap music then listen to ""what you gon to do"" and ""real n**** rolecall"". Those are the only good songs only to the fans of this. If you are not a fan choose the song ""Lovers and friends"" which is the song that will probably appeal to you most."
3,Its the same as before,"You think that because the album again has the word ""Crunk"" in it that it would be even just a slight bit better than the one before, but most of the beats are similar to the ones on his previous albums. Not only that but the lyrics are somewhat repetative. For example The Blow, Skeet Skeet, and In the club. Those sound like a mixture of a few of his previous singles on his previous album. Thought must have not been put into making this cd. Its something you can easily hear in a club, but that and only that."
5,Excellent,The one thing that I admired about the whole cd was the collaboration of all the artist and the effort they put into it to make it such an exceptional cd.
5,Get Crunk,"Alright, I guess I'm gonna be the one disagreeing but let me tell you...the entire ""crunk"" music genre in general is lame to the ""SOBER"" ear. Yet I believe there is a true reason for why they labeled the music as crunk...intoducing a whole new genre to the ""crunk"" listener...and I believe that's how it should stay...You can NOT listen to Lil Jon sober and say it's off the hizzie...but shiiit once you f*cked up it's a whole new story...the beats put you into another realm...I've probably listened to any genre you can name but none of them can even come close to the discrete and undisputable champ Lil Jon for straight up and strictly F*U*C*K*E*D UP Muzic...It don't get better than this so pass the bowl take a shot and turn that BASS UP!....PEACE!!!"
3,36 mafia the real crunck juice,lil jon can make tight beats not as tight as DJ Paul and Juicy Jof three-6-mafia listen to thery old junk and underground PPPPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEE
3,I aint really on crunk songs but,yea i mean i'm gonna keep it real i didn't want to listen to the cd when i got it i just wanted to listen to grand finale but on my way through skimming the cd i discovered that this cd had alot of featured artist that might have ensured platinum status far as lil jon and the eastside boys there lyrics is garbage but there producing is one of the tops in the the bizz and the skits helped alot chris rock are power funny fav song on album of course grand finale a good title for the end of a cd that really didn't move me lyrically at all
1,Vile excrement,Pure trash masquerading as music. Lil Jon makes Britney Spears seem like Mozart . . .
1,"Seriously, is there a less talented performer in the world?","I wish I would've thought of this guy's gimmick back in the day. Get platinum teeth, Wear a bunch of oversize jerseys that say Cruck on them in some form, carry around a goblet or gas can and say it's filled with crunk juice and then walk around yelling inaudible junk and say ""What"" all the time. I'm very good at what I do and have my college degree. It really angers me that we are a society that makes people like this millionaire celebrities. The guy might be a great producer, which is fine, but don't submit us to this guy in any form. I swear he is featured on every song on the radio now. I think Avril Lavigne has him yelling ""what!!"" in the background of her new release or is it ""Yeah!!"", I'm not really sure because I've lost track. I would actually rather have someone chase me in their truck trying to run me over vs. seeing this group in concert. Where have you gone 3rd bass?"
2,It is what it is! Club music!,"Does anyone sell singles anymore? This is not a play all the way through type of CD. But neither are many of the ""Greats"" as the most harshest critics of this bunch have listed! I do think a 'Hits' CD would be better in their case, because it is sad to have to buy a whole CD to listen to a few good songs. It's even sadder though to see people who know they don't have any interest in a group or music genre, write a review out of sheer need to criticize and bash other people's musical choice. Go somewhere and voice an opinion where it matters on something more rediculous than music that you DON'T have to listen to, such as kids passing every class but can't graduate because of TAKS tests, or pitiful health care, or the war or something!"
1,Admirable,"You have to admire a band that is so collectively creative that they come up with gems like:""Boyz"" instead of ""Boys."" That is genius. Who would have gessed that such a symple thing as incorrect spelling would be so integral to a music? Where do these guys come up with such brilliant ideas?Certainly not the library."
1,Thorw in it and press the flush button....,"Never heard such a bad album like this.Lil Jon is such a talented producer and then he made such a senseless and needless album.I hope that his next album will be more powerfull like ""put yo hood up"".By the way: What about chyna whyte and her album??"
2,Crunk Juice,"As a total album can I just say that all Lil Jons CD's I give 2 out of 5. Total Album = Beats, Lyrics, and creativity, and other intangibles such as relevance. While the beats are knockin', Everything else on this album is substandard, with the exception of a couple lyrics by Ice Cube and some other guest stars. I got quickly tired of this album b/c I got tired of hearing Lil' Jon saying one thing and The East Side boys repeating it as if they had no brain to contribute their own words to the tracks. Yeah yeah I know, they were just doing what they were told to do, but gosh...How much can a brotha take of those poor boys yelling!? What it all comes down to is what the listener is looking for; if he merely looking for phat beats and a hook, then this cd is what you need. If you're the tradition Hip Hop fan (like myself) and you need a complete package, (or just actual songs based on lyrics and not beats then this album will hold to the 2 out of 5 I just gave it."
1,Lil Jon Sucks!!,I actually dont own the cd but ive heard enough of his stuff to want to rip my f#kin hair out. Yeah he pretty much sucks all around.
1,Made for the kiddies,"I'm just posting this because I'm so sick of hearing ""crunk"" in everything. I'm sure someone on American Idol will do something ""crunk"" soon enough because practically all music nowadays is from the factory........ You know, BritneyBackstreetSyncDiddy-like! I might be a little less annoyed if the crunk sound has some diversity to it. But it always has lots of bass, some cheap keyboard sounds, ""Real N@#$!s don't give a f@%*! or ""tear da club up"" or ""slap yo' mammy"" or some dumb sh*& like that for lyrics, and.........OKAYYYYY, I'm through complaining."
3,Lil Jon can scream loud......,"well heres another crunk album...not much rapping as you would expect. When listening to a cd like this, you'd expect tight beats, and catchy hooks and stuff but not many of them. I think most of the beats are EXACTLY the same with minor change. I mean really, you will be like ""didnt I just to listen this song."" But anyway theres a few ok beats, but that grand finale song is hard as hell. There is Bun B, TI, Nas, Jadakiss, and Ice Cube on it. I'll give em that one. and theres also some funny skits but way too many of em, on the skits its Chris Rock just sayin stuff and basically dissin women. but anyway that new pac cd come out December 14th, but prolly remastered so I recommend buyin the old stuff first PEACE!!!"
2,Don't Expect Much...,"While the production on this album may be above par, the rapping is some of the worst i have ever heard. If you haven't heard ""Lovers and Friends,"" you need to. This song done by Ludacris and Usher has a great feel to it,,, until Lil Jon ruins it by talking about experimenting sexually with some chick. Another positive is the song ""Grand Finale,"" you can always expect quality from Nas and Jadakiss. I didn't know Lil Jon was so strapped for cash that he had to recycle beats. But check out ""In Da Club,"" by R. Kelly and Ludacris. It is a recycled ""Red Light,"" by Usher that Lil Jon also produced. So, if you do decide to buy this album, know that Lil Jon actually rapped twelve words and he just loops them into different combinations to produce ""Crunk Music."""
1,F*ck Crunk Music,Crunk Juice isnt a rap album. i cant believe this is labeled under rap. If this was labeled under rap then this gets 0 of 5 but under club music 5 of 5. this isnt rap thats all. i dont recommened this to rap fans. club people yes.
1,It just isn't right,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOT RAINING BLOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't believe it. Raining Blood is practically a Metal anthem. Why? Why do this?All who buy this record know, that Slayer has been sampled on it. A classic song called ""Raining Blood"". Us metalheads now mourn for our classic Raining Blood."
3,interesting... but just an outline,"i have benefitted from this book, but only in select areas. there is no real depth in here, only an outline, which it turned out to acknowledge in the beginning. It's rather short and too general for my taste, but still worthwhile to read."
2,an unlikely self-improvement book,"i think that it's great that there are people out there who want to improve themselves, and who want to take control of their disorderly lives. however, i read this book, and did not find it helpful at all. [...]. however, if there are people out there who find solace in these ideas and who can apply them to better themselves then i think that this is great."
4,Charlie Hall is Flying High!,"Charlie Hall's newest release finds him at his best. This album contains a strong group of songs with creative music and insightful lyrics. He starts off with ""Micah 6:8"" which reminds us that worship flows not just so we can feel good but but so that we ""forget not the widow"" and the least of these. Powerful album kick-off!The songs provide a good balance of upbeat praise songs as well as worship songs, but don't stick to the ""sunday morning"" formula that too many worship CD's get bogged down in and sound all the same. The highlights would have to be ""Center"" which talks about Christ being the center of it all. It is a beautiful worship song, and also ""Running With Your Heart"" with its cry to ""bring down heaven's power and presence"".--Yes!!Charlie Hall finally puts out a CD that is in my opinion on the same calibre as his other label mates (Tomlin and Crowder) and honestly I think he passes up Chris Tomlin! Check out the clips and be blessed as you listen."
3,"Here Kitty,Kitty","This is a short wet your appetite journal, begs for more stories, it's a good old fashion detective story that makes you think, and make you feel you are part of the plots, if you like cats and you like good clean story lines Lilian Jackson Braun books are for you."
2,Rare Disappointment,"I just finished this book, and I have to say - I'm sad that Ms. Braun took advantage of those delightful Siamese to write this totally insipid ""journal"". The language doesn't even sound like Jim Q (or Ms. Braun for that matter). It's like it was written by a very young child, with equally bad drawings of the cats. A big disappointment, both in the book and Ms. Braun for publishing it."
3,Fun Book!,"I love all the Cat Who... books, so naturally had to order this one. It was a fun read, and I'm glad I have it in my collection. My only complaint was the size of the book (137 pages)...it's a VERY quick read for the price, which is why I didn't rate it higher."
2,Not the Greatest,"I love to bake, so I thought cookie and bake mixes in a jar would be fun holiday gifts this year. When I got this book I was disappointed just looking through the recipes - most of the cookie mixes called for store bought biscuit mix. I think this is because biscuit mix contains flour, leavening and often powdered shortening, thus saving the recipient of the gift jar from having to add their own shortening. But have you ever had cookies made with biscuit mix? Sub-par at best, and why would I give that to my friends? So I wrote down the 2 recipes in the whole book that I considered usable and returned the book. I found plenty of gift jar recipes online for free, it just took a little google searching. The m&m site has a very good one. This book just isn't worth the money."
3,A unique liitle book,If you have time to putz this book is fun for the holidays!! There area wide variety of recipes. If you are making quantities make sure youhave enough ingredients-it takes more than you think.
2,Potential without execution,"Storyline -- 3 1/2 starsEditing -- 0 starsSpelling -- 5 stars --spellcheck works great, but can't fix word use!Word use -- 1 star-- way, way too many mis-used words. Break for brake, there for their, no for know, etc.Writing -- 1 1/2 stars -- stilted prose, stumbling sentences.Characters -- 2 stars -- okay development, way too much stereotyping (or profiling.)Overall, it's readable but barely. If you can't look past word use and grammatical errors go elsewhere.Mr. Stanfield GO FIND A GOOD EDITOR! Your story has a smidgen of potential but it needs some serious help as written. I gave you 2 stars because I did finish it and the story was okay. But, as written, even that might be a tad high. Find an editor. I'd look at another offering by you but if samples show the same issues I won't be back."
3,Book review,"The story was plausible, but repetitious. After repeating the action many times, he ended the book poorly. 700 pages and we get this? And the spelling made my teeth grate. Or he would say-- greated my teef. The spelling may have been his way to appear as an authentic southern red neck. If not, I will volunteer to correct the spelling for free."
4,"Good content, poor grammar, poor editing.","I really enjoyed the book. There were several issues that, for me, were hard to deal with. Spelling and grammar were the biggest issues that I had with this book. The use or misuse of homonyms throughout the book was pretty bad. I think that the plot and premise of the book was very interesting. It is still a good read and I recommend it it, but the proofreader and editor could have put a little more effort forth in their respective areas."
3,"Interesting Story, but Painful to Read","I must say that the story has potential. However, the author needs to for sure find a decent editor. There is a mistake in spelling or grammer on nearly every single page. It is painful to read. There is a lot of useless filler that needs to be edited out, it could be reduced to a 400 page book and be much better. And he uses a lot of phrases over and over in the book which does tend to be annoying such as ""take a knee"". He must have used that line 150 times in the book. But it is interesting, good story line and somewhat believable."
3,Editing is your friend,"This was almost painful to read because of the spelling and grammar errors. I made it all the way through (that would be ""threw"" in this book) the story but it was a struggle at times. There is a story in there somewhere; too bad the book was not edited before it was published."
3,"Great story, but ...","First, the good. I really liked the story and the characters. It was a great, interesting read. However, the spelling and overall grammar are terrible! It's like the author never passed his high school grammar class. To the author: Dude, come on! At least get someone to proofread your writing! You have a definite talent, and I would definitely read more that you write, but PLEASE get a proofreader! Or at least look up the differences between words like to, too, and two; decent and descent; waste and waist; and there, their, and they're."
1,Not so hot,Nice plot. But the constant barrage of grammatical and spelling errors really and I mean really detracts from this book. The author must really need remedial school. The author also has a constant fixation with using firearms and forgets the one fundemental of fighting: the best weapon is one's brain and the ability to adapt overcome and immagination.
1,My undergraduate students could have done better.,"Frankly, after about fifteen pages of this sloppy writing--which even my undergraduate writing students could have made passable prose--I just gave up. What a shame--good story line. He could have given some grad student in a creative writing program a hundred bucks to winnow out the most egregious blunders and come out with a far superior product.I have kept the book to pass around among my students to show them just how bad a manuscript can be and still be published. They just won't believe that something so shoddy could actually be printed and distributed."
2,The Collapse,The spelling is atrocious. It totally distracts from what could be a good story. There are so many errors you begin to wonder if they might be intentional!
2,Ouch,A great story idea.I also enjoyed the characters.I give it the two stars for those two points.However the spelling and all the other errors made it a book I had to choke down to finish.Instead of buying this book I should have been payed to read it.It's amazing a book so horribly edited would be offered for sale
4,What happened to proofreaders?,"This book has a great story line. However... there is not ONE page without at least one spelling, grammar, or just plain using the wrong word on it. The author has MAJOR problems with homonym, i.e. using 'no' instead of 'know'! I wanted to take a red pencil to the book and send it to the publisher. Given all that the author has much promise, IF he gets the editing he desparately needs!"
1,Save your time and money,"Oh if only I had read a few more of the reviews. I am a great ( as opposed to grate) fan of Post Apolcalypse fare, have read heaps of much cheaper and much better written books. This one was appalling. The spelling, grammar and punctuation were abysmal - did the author even re-read this? Surely not cause you'd be hard pressed to miss the errors. Don't think you can overlook this cause the story is a good one. It's not. It jumps all over the place...oh I could go on and on but why bother.I cannot remember the last time (as opposed to thyme) I didn't finish a book - but after about 100 pages I could take no more. Spare yourself and buy something decent. Pick up one of the 99cent cheapies like The Journal or Lights Out. You will save yourself money and be spared a painful reading experience."
5,Can't wait for more!!,"Perhaps it is the fact that we now live in Gulf Shores Alabama part time, or that my husband has been a police officer in Nashville,TN for many years, that caused a ""Kinship"" to the author. But I LOVED THIS BOOK! I read ALOT in this subject line and have found so many that give you just a short story (so you are forced to keep paying to read the whole story,upsets me to know end!) But this is a geat long read. I hated everytime I had to put it down! Even as it was longer than most, it kept you turning pages and at the end>>>>> I just wanted more. Great Whole book at a great price! Just want to know....Jeff, when can we expect more?!"
5,You are NOT ready for the Collapse!,"What made this book gripping was the ever-present ""What would I do..."" question for the reader; as the different scenarios unfold. In truth, almost nobody can be as fully prepared as the end of society would require. You may have ammo, but no food, or food but no gas. Medical care is a tough one!I also felt the timeline was about right- near total breakdown of society in only a few days. A very thought provoking book...I found very few misspelled words! Instead it looks like a spelling checker was used and every single time a correctly spelled synonym was inserted. It didn't detract much from this fascinating and sobering book."
4,The Collapse,"This will only be a partial review. So far, I'm only about 15% into the book and I've found two things that bother me. First, one of the character names. I thought it was supposed to be Spyder, then it was Spider. Not good. Character names should always be kept straight. Second, a quote 12% into the story. ""What a wicked web we weave when we practice to deceive."" The original quote is as follows: ""Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive."" Sir Walter Scott. If you're going to use a quote, then use it correctly. OK, now I'm 67% into this book and I don't think a spell check is needed as much as a grammar teacher. The words aren't so much misspelled as the wrong word used. Example: innocents verses innocence. Spelled correctly but wrong word used. This book really needs a very detailed editor."
4,"Othr den speling and grammer, A good red","I hate to admit how much I enjoyed this book. All the blood and guts - wow! And I loved the ""cast"" of hero characters. I did have a problem of how very very VERY mean and nasty the motorcycle gangs, street gangs, FEMA agents and soldiers were. (Did I mention how mean they ALL were?) Not one shred of humanity in any of them was a bit hard to swallow and way overdone. You could go onto death row in any prison and find more human emotions. But a good story. Did a lot of skipping through a lot of the lengthy details that made what should have been a 400 page book into 634 pages."
1,A waste of time & money,"What a terrible waste of time & money. Extremely primitive writing. How any publisher could let this go out is beyond me. In terms of movies it have to be below a ""B"" movie. Do they give grades of F? The dialog, the predictable seqeunce of events, the fact that none of the ""good guys"" get much more than a scratch, The UN factor, the length of the book which is so boring, well it just stinks. I can't properly describe how painful the dialog is to go through.On the only upside there are some good list of equipment that would constitute survival kits for home or auto."
3,collapse,"Good story tough read. Have to agree with the other reviews, good story but NO proofreading. The constant mistakes make it hard to keep up with the flow of the book. Still worth the effort however."
1,"If you liked Stalin, you'll LOVE ""History of Eastern Europe""","While the book was helpful in learning basic geography of eastern Europe and had many humorous comments, I had a hard time getting past the blatant sympathy for communism. The section on the Soviet Union, for example, described the ""widespread discontent"" brought about by Stalin's collectivization of agriculture. A cartoon showed a sad farmer wearing a barrel with little straps. There was no mention of the tens of millions who died as a result of the intentional destruction of their seed grain, nor any mention of the purges or slave labor camps. The authors implied that while communism was ""unpopular"", capitalism produces ""unemployment, homelessness and destitution"".America was described as an empire exactly analagous to the Soviet Union and it's puppet states.The authors did concede that Joe Stalin had corrupted the idealistic dream of Marx and Lenin."
3,Task Essential Oxywater Toning Spray,"This is actually the first time Ive tried their product. I first saw it in a group buying site here when I decided to check it here on amazon. It is much cheaper here so I decided to buy it. Anyway, I think it's quite similar to that of another brand but nonetheless, it does it's job of refreshing one's face:) Would I really recommend it? Yes if you're the type of person who wants cool down often but if you're okay with just washing your face with plain running water then forget about buying this. Im not saying that spraying this on your face is the same as washing your face with water but if you're not the type that likes carrying a lot of stuff in your bag then I think you'll live even without it. But if you're the spray loving type then by all means, get a can or two and bring it with you wherever you. You never know when you need that cool-refreshing-spritz and spray loving fun:)"
2,terrible guide book,not nearly enough picsonly 3 pages on Ranier which is what I was really interested in.Maps are very rudimentary
2,Don't waste your time,"This is a good book if you are desperate to know something of this man's life, but it is too vanila, too watered down to be any thing but a guarded look at a good poet."
5,Excellent small reference book with great drawings!,"This book won't replace a 600 pages reference book, but is a great little book which actually packs quite a bit of information. The drawings are beautifula and very detailed, which contributes to making this book attractive to seriously interested people as well as children."
2,Poor Performances,This excellent music is presented in marginal and harsh-sounding performances by the City of Prague Philharmonic. The Glory and Getteysburg balances are way off...the orchestra (and chorus especially) has no clue as to the blend or effect required for these wonderful pieces of music (where is the boy's choir??)Percussion is often wooden and too close to the front soundstage.There are far better renditions of most of this music available..although not in one collection. (See Telarc's Victory at Sea and some of the London reissues of film music).
5,My daughter loves this book,My 3-year old daughter loves the story so much that she reads it over and over again until she is able to recite. This is an excellent book that helps mommy and child bond. Highly recommended!
5,Favorite Bedtime book,My 2 year old and I read this every night. It is a wonderful book and we look forward to it every night.
5,hosiery,"Berkshire offers a nice line of products. I especially like the ultra sheer hosiery. These are fine and will last a little longer because they are thicker and not as sheer but nice. I guess a daysheer, you might call it. I prefer ultra sheer, you see the true color of the pantyhose."
5,I love Berkshire pantyhose!,"I've been buying this brand of pantyhose's for years, even though they're kind of expensive they're worth the price. They don't run easily, and they make your legs look even sexier."
4,Assez bien,"Je l'ai téléchargé pour une classe de littérature (parce que je n'ai pas envie de dépenser l'argent), et c'était satisfaisant, mais la mise en forme n'était pas simple et il y avait quelques petits erreurs. Surtout, toutefois, c'a marché.I downloaded this for a French lit class (because I didn't want to spend money) and it was satisfactory, but the formatting wasn't straightforward and there were a few small errors. Above all, however, it worked."
4,Top o' the line,"If you're in a country kinda mood, you can do worse than turn to the Godfather of Punk, Popmeister Extraordinaire, Nick Lowe. I'm biased - I love this guy. This was the first NL recording I bought, and I've never looked back. It contains old classics (I Knew the Bride), new classics (John Hiatt's She Don't Love Nobody), the weird (Bobo Skediddle Daddle) and the wonderful (Long Walk Back). Still in his Cowboy Outfit mode, this is a more mature offering, more balanced, more thoughtful. All of which is offset by the everybody-skate loopiness of Darlin' Angel Eyes. You work it out."
5,HIS BEST!!!,"Amazing that his best work is perhaps the hardest to find. Preferable, to me (a major fan), to any of the greatest hits compilations (except of course the box set). We have here a microcosm of all that is good about rock music: one of the best rock songs ever (Rose of England), a bass-driven instrumental (Long Walk Back), a flat out stomper (I Knew the Bride), a tender ballad (I Can Be The One You Love), and so on. You'll still be smiling from the enjoyment of one just completed track when this CD takes you off in still another pleasant direction. Seek it out. Oh, yes, I forgot to mention; following the unwritten rule of great albums, you have the requisite one clunker (Bo Bo Skediddle). Sorry about that. But you won't mind too bad."
1,cheap plastic-collapsed the 2nd day,"I thought this was a wonderful idea, but the plastic was so cheap that it collapsed the 2nd day after I planted my seeds. I would not ever buy this item again. Very dissapointing for a Burpee item-you would expect higher quailty from them."
2,"Great idea, don't bother with the included soil","I was so excited when i brought this home and was in love until it was time to take the first plant out.The germination rates were great, the watering system worked flawlessly...but the plants are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to remove without making a gigantic mess and killing most of them.On the off chance that i could get the entire ball out pushing from the bottom, the 'dirt' completely crumbles away from the roots and leaves a very sad little plant behind - all of which, even with very careful planting, died promptly.After pulling them out, it didn't seem as though the root system was well established at all (compared to vermiculite rooting).I gave this product a 2 because the self watering is wonderful, and I'm trying to set up a home system to water larger trays of vermiculite starters."
2,Made cheaply,This item is made very cheaply. Seed cells won't hold their shape due to extremely thin plastic and can be pierced easily. The top does not fit well at all either. It's just my opinion that you pass on this item and purchase the starting kit that is about 10-12 dollars more and has lots of better features.
3,ultimate seed system,"comes with expanding peat plugs, 6 of the 72 plugs didn't expand, the watering system was great, watered evenly and easy to refill, the dome needs to be higher to allow for larger growth of seedlings."
1,Impossible to remove the seedlings from the system,I was a first time seedling grower when I used this product. But I found it too hard to remove the seedlings from the containers once they had grown. I would not use this system again.
4,Excellent Seed Starter,"I've used various plant starting sets over the years and last year ran across this. I got the best results I'd ever gotten. Bought a new one this year and my plants were sprouting within 12 hours! They are WAY ahead of me getting them out to the garden.The only reason this recieves a 4 vice a 5 is the material is a little flimsey. I tore up last years trying to get some of the plants out. If the plant holders were a little more solid, this would be the best ever.I don't know what's in the pellets, but I wish my 12x4 raised bed garden was FULL of it!"
2,good but not recommended,The growing process was great but once you take them out you either damage the roots or all the soil comes apart and doesn't matter how damp it is.
1,5 stars? weird ...,"Both pieces are played way too fast for a romantic concerto. The technical expertise of Heifetz is breathtaking, but this is not what these concertos are about. After Perlman or Kyung Wha Chung (and many others) you just cannot listen these readings, no matter the efforts you make.And there is a discernible hiss. You just can't put this disk in a high-end audio system which will bring it to the fore in full."
5,Cheer and Pleasure,"Somehow Heifitz makes it all sound easy, relaxed, and well worth repeating. It is fun, sweet, exciting, sad, and loving. If you really love violin music, this is the best."
1,crap!!!,Speechless? Becuz unless I have a defective one this thing did'nt do anything. Not enough instructions. Especially for different circumstances. N it has to scan just like any other remote. Very disappointed!!!
1,Battery came dead -and month later died.,"The battery was dead when I got it.I tried it with a new battery and it worked.So that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.I tried it on my old Standard TV and works on that, and works on all the other tvs I've tried. It's awesome.EDIT :: 6/28/2012 - the controller no longer works, even with new batteries. 1 star."
1,joke remote,Never worked. Tried many things and it just would work. I don't recomend this to anyone. Bought it for my grandson and he was so disappointed when it wouldn't work I told him I would get one from thinkgeek.com
1,Save your money,Doesn't work very well at all. I was able to get it to mute 1 TV one time but that was it. Pretty much useless. Recommend you try something else.
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this thinking it would be funny if while my brothers were watching TV for it to suddenly turn off. But I tried, and tried to get it to work but it didn't. I then returned it and they issued a full refund. Don't get it, it's not worth the time or frustration."
2,Just didn't work for me,"i have 3 tv's in my house...2 fairly new Samsung flat screens and 1 LG lcd...the remote did not work on none of these 3. I then tried it at my work where they have a smaller, older Samsung flat screen and it worked just fine one day, but next day it didn't. When it did work, it was really cool. I then took tried it Costco and went thru about 10-12 different tv's to see which all ones i could control. Out of all of those, it only synced up to 2. In addition to that the mute button (the main one you need to pair with a tv) started to stick and not work right, so i just sent it back. it just didn't do it for me, but i will say when it actually did work it was really cool..just seemed the one or 2 times i really wanted to use it, it didn't work"
4,Fun!,"It turned off most of the TVs I tried to turn off. Like 4/5 of the TVs I did. I found it fun to turn off TVs at places, the price is a little tough, but if you have the cash, you can buy it. It's worth it."
2,remote broke,"When I got the remote it worked perfectly on my TV the next day It wouldnt work on any other TV's except on my own but on my TV it could only turn it OFF not on, mute it and the TV video function."
1,Didnt work,"I ordered the Mini stealth remote but when i got it it did not work!! It did come in its original package but I just couldn't make it work I followed the instructions correctly, I think this is a really cool item but I wouldn't buy it a second time."
1,Did not work.,Product did not even power up. I'm not sure if the battery worked or not but it didn't work at all.
1,Missing Battery,When this came in the mail there was no battery in the little plastic bumb. The package was lightly open in the corner enough so someone can take the battery out. I would not recommend this to anyone!
1,Disappointed,"I received this little jewel with great anticipation, it worked once the first time I used it. Tried changing the battery still nothing worked. Followed the directions to the T. So I trashed it...lesson learned."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!,i just bought the EXACT SAME THING for less than 2 bucks by HDE! AND ITS BLACK SO DONT BUY IT FROM HERE PEOPLE!!
1,got it.,didn't work at all.checked to make sure I was usingit on supported TV's.I was.changed the batteries.no luck.
3,nice,it came early but it said it works on lg tv's and mine doesnt but its still awesome to mess with ppl at walmart and to mess with my friends
2,ThinkGeek Spy Remote,"This product was not as described at all, it does not work. It was described as easy to operate but is actually really hard."
1,Maybe only for tube TVs?,"I've tried this on about seven TVs so far, following the directions exactly, and none of them has responded. Yeah, the battery's fine and I pulled out the plastic tab (well, *I* would have asked). On the one hand, the thing was really cheap, so I'm not out much; on the other, even six bucks is way too much for something that doesn't work at all."
1,Never got the remote,I never got the package. This was a waste of my dads money and never got anything. It said i would get the in nov. it is know jan. I do not buy this!!!
1,Did not work,"I could not get this to work on any TV. There are no lights on the remote, so you can't tell if it is even sending out a signal."
1,not satisfied,worked on first tv i tried took a while to get programed everything worked except channel changer. needs a led light so you know its working. the face of remote was peeling off when i took it out of box
1,Hasn't worked on any of the TVs I have tried it on.,"Maybe this would work on older TVs or something, but I have tried it on a number of new and not-so-new flat screen TVs and so far it hasn't worked on any of them. I made sure I was following the directions, it just doesn't appear to work, at least not on the TVs we have around here..."
1,Didn't work,"Lights doesn't light up, doesn't at work at all on any tv, I suppose remote is not functional. Last time I'm buying from this seller."
3,"Simple design, not sure if it works","In concept, this device was exactly what I was looking for. I work at a club, and we have about 30 tvs that show content. I needed something that could quickly correct the channels (3-4-5-6) that we use to broadcast different content.This would be the ideal item for it, short of one thing: It doesn't support the models of flat screens I have. I've tried to program it to every code (it cycles through them all) and it would not communicate with the TVs.Not a bad idea for 6$, but not what I needed.Also, shipping took almost a month from overseas."
2,It works but...,"I ordered a three pack of these. I was excited to try it out in restaurants or prank friends. However it was difficult to do without giving away that I was the one doing it. I found that you had to be very close to the TV for it to work and it took A LOT longer than the five seconds or so it said. Also the buttons seemed to be pretty cheap after using it a couple times I noticed myself having to press the buttons harder and harder for them work. The product does work (worked on about 90% of the TVs I tried), just no where near as well as I was expecting it to."
5,A Must have for Proteomic and BioStatistic knowledge,"This book is one of the seminal works in the field. Although it is extremely difficult to get a hold on, it is well worth the effort. I cannot imagine trying to understand the incredibly complex field of Biostatistics and Proteomics with out this invaluable guide."
3,Interesting follow-up to Rush To Judgment,"While it seems obvious that the main reason this book was written was because Mark had a runaway, suprise best-seller with his first book and his publisher wanted a follow-up, this IS a decent volume. There is some intersting info. on Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden, as well.[...]"
2,I wouldn't reccomend this deck,I wouldn't recommend this deck since it is cartoony and the minor arcana is just the number of the suit (ex: two staffs is on two of wands)
2,Didn't care much for this...,"I've never heard Transmisia's other releases, maybe their other stuff is better than this, so I won't bash them too much. Certainly, I'm sure there are those out there who would love this. They're industrial-metal (accent on ""metal"") that don't seem too incredibly creative in their music. The title track is the only one that really caught my attention -- it has a good beat and some very good basslines that dominate the song (it reminded me, strangely enough, of what Primus might possibly sound like if they tried being an industrial band). If you're a metal fan or love the industrial-metal hybrid, this might be up your alley. But if you're an industrial fan who doesn't want the electronics to be overpowered by the guitars, you should probably pass this one up. Many of the bands on the Invisible label have a certain similarity in sound, it seems, but Transmisia seems to be an exception to the rule."
5,Excellent book,"After reading this book, I was VERY happy to have spent the money to pick this one up!What struck me most, just from reading the table of contents, was the breadth of the content that is found in Flash: the Future. Not only is there information on creating Flash content for PocketPC 2002, but the book also covers Flash for Broadcast (DVD, iTV, and consoles), as well as the Nokia 9200 series. This book covers all of these topics extremely well. Just over half of the book devoted to developing content for the Pocket PC.There are several different authors who contribute chapters in this section, and each authors' respective expertise in each different topic is evident throughout the section. For example, in each chapter you will find valuable tips and tricks that only come from such experience.Flash: the Future is a well written and well edited title, and I strongly recommend picking it up if you are serious about Flash development."
1,In favor of truth in advertising,"Mr. Torrone, in his 11/15/02 review of this book (below), presents himself as if in error, complicitous (with Amazon), or simply self-serving, as his assertion that ""Amazon has a special ..."" is 100% FALSE. NO ""special""; rather, merely two books bundled together with no savings over separate purchasing. In addition, Mr. Torrone conveniently fails to mention the fact that *Flash Enabled* is authored by Mr. Torrone himself. In error? Complicitous? Self-serving? You be the judge."
2,if you really like bangin'...,"Like most house music, the underlying thunk-thunk-thunk of this album rarely changes. Most of this disc is hard house, so it's fast and very intense. I think I've got some pretty cranked stuff in my collection but this just pounded my skull -- repetitive stress headache. Maybe Irene is a master of this genre, but I wanted more beats, more highs and lows.In a similar vein, I found Bad Boy Bill and Humpty's ""House Connection 2"" to have more interest. And I prefer the mixed up beats from DJ Icey and others."
1,This is not House Music by anyone's standards,"Hey boys and girls, it's Dj Irene with yet another hideously layed out selection of beats that you'd be embarassed to hear any self-respecting DJ spin. As if the Global House Diva intro wasn't bad enough, the tracks are all sub-standard house selections and the mixing is barely adequate. Do yourself a favor if you like the hard house genre and pick up any Bad Boy Bill CD, because this garbage ain't worth your money."
1,How did we allow this to happen....,"This seperates the good house music from the bad (this being among the worst!)... as long as the clubs get packed, right?"
5,My favorite role playing resource,"I tried for a long time to come up with ways to make my games more than a series of fights, and never really succeeded until I found Riddle Rooms. Now every time we play there is always a break in the action where my players have to take some time to solve a riddle or puzzle. This helps them actually role play and add personality to their character instead of just thinking of themselves as a collection of stats.The riddles and puzzles here all make sense in the context of the game, they have cool treasures that fit into the theme of the challenge, and I can choose from straightforward ones that will take 5 - 15 minutes, or multi-layered ones that can be the basis for an entire evening of playing.This book is a definite must if you want to evolve beyond hack-and-slash role-playing."
2,"good ilustrustrations, semi-good logic","The puzzles are nothing but riddles. Every single puzzles includes a riddle to solve in some way which makes it tiring after the first room. the logical Puzzles that players need to make are somewhat common sense that requires looking for an a specific object. ie, to cut the chain then you need to find the special axe. To get the axe then you got to first find the special key. the get that special key then you first have to break the Key casing around it with another particular item. It is full of puzzles like this and sometimes, pages seems to be wasted just to type out one large 4 line riddle to show to players when you can just say it."
5,Review from an Oculoplastic Surgeon,"This is an excellent book. I still use it as a reference for Asian Blepharoplasty especially the more difficult cases such as repeat surgeries refered to me for corrections. It is also an excellent basic book for beginners of Asian and Caucasian blephs since the same healing principals apply, just the anatomy is different. Tim Carey MD Seattle"
2,The show is so much better without Sheen!,"The show is so much better without Charlie Sheen, it is lighter and so much funnier!Good Job! I enjoy this show so much more without the alcoholic jokes, and the sexual grap.Ashton rocks! He is so sweet and innocent. Love it!"
5,Great but short,"If you are looking for a great ending season that allows closure to 8 seasons of the best comedy, then this isn't it. However, if you're looking for the last funny season with Charlie Sheen before the show tanked, then this is the season for you."
3,twoand an half men season8,very disapponted that I had to pay for a full season when obviously it was cut short because of Charlie Sheens antics. Other wise it was my favorite sitcome!
1,Bob Rodriguez,I agree that it is not a complete 8 season therefore it should be priced at a prize range of 15-20.00 dollars
2,cost,"Way overpriced for such a short season!!!!!!!! Just because Charlie is being such a waste of time especially to his loyal fans, his family and himself, why should we have to pay so much for an unfisished season. $15.99 would be fair!!!"
1,Worst season of all,"This was and is the worst season out of all except for Rose, she is what made the shows. Alan was just plain stupid, Charlie was an idiot, and Jake, he is too old for his part as a B.A. teenager. I would't waste my money for this season as it is not worth a cent."
2,why pay full price?,Why pay full price for half a season?? I'm not spending my hard earned money on something that was half assed done? Charlie Sheen went nuts and couldn't even finish his job for the season and I'm expected to pay almost $40? That's wrong! This definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for two and a half men.
5,Sorry Charlie's Gone....,It's rare when a show comes along that changes so little but leaves one with wanting to see it again and again. This is a classic series for the ages.
1,No Ending & No More Charlie,"This season is cut short without an ending after only 16 episodes. Now that Charlie has been fired, there is no way to end the season or the series properly. Just like Charlie Harper, the cool babe hound who was turned by the producers into a stumbling wimpy drunk, this once mighty comedy is now a weak sitcom."
2,"Item 3 Stars, Amazon 1 Star",I agree with everyone else... Way over priced for only 2/3 a season. AND the Amazon product details are incorrect as usual. It says 484 minutes... on 2 CDs? .... Really now! Highly doubtful!! Since that much won't fit on just 2 CDs as well as the fact that 22 episodes times 22 minutes a piece is 484 minutes..... hmmmmmm .... 484 is the running time listed for this item... strange isn't it! This season is only 16... 22 minute episodes. Should read 352 minutes. How does a supposedly reputable leader like Amazon CONTINUALLY make this same mistake on many DVD sets? If you need a quality control person to review all your listings before they are posted I am available!!
3,Incredible!,"I love this show and bought the first 7 seasons. I held off on the 8th because it was $29.99, way too high for an incomplete season. I checked the price early this week and guess what? It actually had gone up to $30.99!!! Incredible! Great season or not, I'm not willing to shell out this much dough for 16 episodes. Shame on you, Amazon - or whoever is responsible the price increase. You should treat your loyal customers and fans better than that!"
1,Two and a Half Men,"They messed up on the title of this DVD, ""Two and a Half Men : The INCOMPLETE Eighth Season"" is what it should say....I have watched this show from day one, own all of the DVD's, but WILL NOT pay full price for a little more than half a season. And BTW....without Charlie Sheen the show is doomed, Ashton Kutcher couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in a pouring down rain storm. The story of Charlie's death just doesn't work...terrible writing."
1,not worth purchasing,My son had to use these for a school project and when he brought them into school the teacher said that they were worthless and he should have sent them back...We'll never purchase anything like this again on the internet.
4,Pocket-sized fun.,"I must admit I was more than shocked when I opened my Amazon box and found this book. It is so small!!!! Size does matter!!!However, to be fair, I started to read. It is surprisingly full of great tips! (I was worried that it was going to be some rip-off gift book).I liked the tip about excess use of eye cream (result: puffy morning eyes), showering a few hours before going out (your own sex smell won't be overpowered) and not washing your hair right before coloring (roots show up better).As long as you are prepared for a hand-sized book, it's worth the price with lots of ah hah's!"
1,Do not buy AcomData products.,I bought a 250 GB drive about a year 1 1/2 ago. It ran ok until one day the drive started making noise and stopped working the next day. I contacted AcomData but they never returned by emails. Took the drive to have the data extracted. The data recover company said the drive is formatted in a strange way. Said it would cost $1250 to recover the data if they are able to do it at all.AcomData sucks. Buy at your own risk.
3,"Good bits, poor instructions","Soon after I received the bits I used them to cut some edge rabbits. The bits seem to be of high quality. What isn't is the instructions. I wanted to cut a 1/4 x 1/4 rabbit. The instructions showed what bearing, washer etc should be used. When I looked at the bearings the identification numbers on the instructions did not match any of the bearing numbers. I had to look on line for some physical dimensions of the required bearings to tell which I should use. Someday I wont be able to find the characteristics on line. The assembly instructions are terrible"
4,Good rabbeting set,I'm impressed with the overall quality of this set. However don't throw the instructions away because there are different size screws for the bearings and it can get kind of confusing.
4,Rare coverage on this weapon...,"I have been a martial arts practioner for over 15 years. I have studied Korean, Burmese and Japanese Martial Arts. This book is a great workbook for a martial artist. The photos give you step by step instruction. Also one of the nice features is the street application of the weapon in the back of the book. If you train in martial arts this is a great edition to your library. I am very happy to see the evolution from the first edition to the second. I encourage all martial artisit no matter your style to go out and get this work book!"
4,Valuable resource for practical self defense.,"This is valuable book for anyone training in martial arts or someone that would like to know practical self defense techniques with common items such as a cane, umbrella or golf club. There are 23 well defined techniques with step by step illustrations and written instructions.The layout of pictures and text provides space for making notes. Having studied hanbo under Sensei John Goss, this book is a valuable resource for reference and details. The hanbo is used not as a tool or club but rather than a conduit for aiki. Aiki has many forms; leading, surprise, breath and atemi (strike or a focused cut motion). I have been training for 9 years and this is a book that I use weekly! When you look at the cost per technique, the book is a real bargain."
4,A Great Summary of the Inquisition,"Written by a prominent Jewish author, THE SPANISH INQUISITION is a book that really should be made public, to get across the truths about it. Many people today get most of their information about the Inquisition from Poe's THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM or from some other bad source. This is a book which anyone who wishes to know about Church history or Spanish history should read. If you are looking for an answer to the ""Muslim question,"" or the Inquisition's response to Muslims, this book does not tend to cover that too well. Also, a poor account of St. Vincent Ferrer is given, which can be construed almost as a smear campaign against him. At any rate, a good book worth spending the money and time on."
4,Separation of Facts & Fiction,"A refreshing take on The Spanish Inquisition. Henry Kamen separates the facts from the myths. As a Spanish Literature major at UCLA, I found this book very useful and impartial. Kamen gives data that is very interesting to say the least. Dates and people are mentioned, something that lacks in many books. He presents dates from very reliable sources. The footnotes are almost extreme but it is a job well done."
5,Excellent history book,"Contrary to some prejudiced reviewers who erroneously think that Kamen is attempting to justify or downplay the Spanish Inquisition, this book is actually a major work of historical scholarship. It is fascinating to learn the real story of what happened (and yes, it is quite barbaric by modern standards, though not nearly so horrific as the Black Legend would have us believe) since the Spanish Inquisition holds such a place of horror in the minds of average people today, who don't read history books. The book is very long and erudite, but if you are interested in learning about the facts of the Spanish Inquisition, you pretty much have to read this book.As for putting to death the Black Legend, I'm afraid this book will do little, because mostly only scholars are going to read it. Certainly not anti-Catholics who twist history to suit their agenda."
3,Crimes of faith,I read this book about six months ago and as I recall it was very informative. However I should say it is important to not base one's beliefes on just one source. The inquistion is serious subject that deserves indepth research. This book source I felt was more to do with appologetics than showing how religious dogma can be used to justify crimes against humanity.
3,Flimsy & Damaged,"The Craftsman Top Chest was delivered by U.P.S. to my front porch (I was not at home) and was dropped off by driver, damaged. Not much packing in original cardboard box for protection, being the Craftsman brand I expected a better grade of tool chest. Damage was a medium size double dent, just left of the lock, but very noticeable. Don't know if it was damaged at Amazon LLC before it was shipped or during delivery? Also, I believe Amazon should have more discription of product, from their supplier, thickness (guage) of material. Looking at several of the same style chest, the only differance was color and price."
3,buyer beware,"If you own the first two volumes of this great TV series, you already have four out of the six episodes on this disc. For some reason, the manufacturer decided to duplicate episodes instead of providing all new ones, different than those on volumes one and two.A big disappointment, as I love this series and I was looking fwd to new episodes. Only buy if you must have the two episodes that are different. It's not terribly expensive. If you don't have the first two volumes, then this is a nice little collection."
4,Tightly packed like a book on commas and semicolons and more should be!,"The complexity of the subject(s) makes for a bit of confusion, but it is all in here. My copy is already dog-eared after only a couple of days in my possession and pretty constant use. It is much easier to use than the huge volumes of similar advice that once stood on their own tables at the local library. Already I have bookmarks throughout it."
2,Killing Joke without Jaz,"Hard core Killing Joke fans might be interested in this. The rest of the band made this album in the early 90s with some other dude singing. It has a bit of an industrial sound to it, complete with lots of ""industrial"" sound effects in the background, like clanging metal pipes etc. The song ""Murder Inc."" prominently features the sounds of a dot matrix printer, a real blast from the past. Geordie gets in some decent KJ style guitar riffs but the singer just isn't Jaz Coleman. He sounds a bit like a second rate David Bowie and personally I just don't think his voice is well suited to the music. A lot of the songs seem to end very abruptly, like they were a bit hurried putting this album out. The last song, ""Mrs. Whiskey Name"", is an ill-conceived traditional drinking song with drumming. Give it a listen on Grooveshark.com before purchasing."
1,Boring!,"This book was boring!! The ending was dumb and frankly I thought the story was pointless. Basically it's about a man who falls into a coma and he thinks that he is awake then leaves the hospital. When he gets home and falls asleep, he wakes up to find all these wierd things happening to him. These illusions or daydreams that he has makes him realize that he never woke up from the coma, so he tries different things to wake himself up like strolling down memory lane. This story builds you up with suspense but at the end you will be VERY disappointed. I would not waste my money on this book."
3,Interesting but underwhelming,"I think the premise here is very interesting. The writing is fine. The execution and the story? A bit underwhelming. It's not that it's flat out boring, so much as it seems like there is so much more that could have been done here.I wonder what someone like Jonathan Carroll could have done with this material and I think that would have been a much better,weirder, thoughtful, more-going-on-than-you-think kind of book.This is a good book to check out at the library, read in a day, return and then probably forget about."
4,Worthy experiment,"I found The Coma to be so different to The Beach ,and so much better than the Tesseract.Yes it is an experiment and why not. It is what writing is all about. Only a 4 due to the obvious comparison with Iain Banks.I still think that Garland has led the way for the Britpack,i.e. great new writers like Colin Butts, Steve Horsfall, Kevin Sampson"
3,Needs some salt,"I must tell you that when I originally read the description I was intrigued, it was and still is an good concept. Garland however failed to pull it off. I wasn't too terribly interesting, other than the book store scene, and the childhood home scene. Read it in an hour, won't read it again, thinking about selling it to the used book store, but it looks cool on my shelf. Oh and it does have a cool look with nice interesting art work."
3,Alex Garland - The Coma. Lightly Entertaining,"I'm going to make this fairly brief.This book was enjoyable and a good light read, but not as thought provoking as I expected - fairly disapointing. I was left wondering a few things but nothing very important to the storyline and not anything that I would ever have concrete closure about. I recommend reading this book for it's descriptive imagery, it's enjoyable but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless very cheap. You could sit in a library and read it in one sitting.Alex Garland is a brilliant writer but I'm going to keep waiting for his next major piece before I write him off completely."
4,throughly enjoyed this,"I spent a few weeks in the hospital on life support.I could enjoy this book after that experience, because much of what he says is familiar. So familiar I wondered if he had really been in a coma or come close to death himself."
2,Why so short,"I can't argue that the story was not gripping, but I read it in an hour............Ater such a long wait since The Tesseract I expected more."
3,THE COMA,YOU'LL HAVE TO RE-READ THE LAST CHAPTERS JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE BOOK... I'M ON THE FENCE ON THIS ONE...
2,Ponderous,"I was a big fan of Mr. Garland's debut novel ""The Beach,"" less so of ""The Tesseract,"" and while I was entertained by his latest effort, I can't say it compares favorably to the narrative drive and thrill of his first book. ""The Coma"" is essentially a short story interspersed with some interesting wood cut illustrations by his father that really serve little purpose beyond bulking up the page count. You keep turning the pages in hopes that some sort of narrative thread will be picked up, only to discover by book's end that you're more-or-less right back where you started with little illumination, and you'll be hard-pressed an hour later to even remember the characters' names.Still, Garland is a talented writer and I will keep buying his books in hopes that the next one will achieve the same literary heights as his debut."
2,Strong start...lame ending,This novella starts off competently with an attack on the tube and the narrators' subsequent descent into what he first thinks are hallucinations and then brain damage only to discover he's actually in a coma. From this chilling and intriguing concept it deteriorates into a dream world where questions are never quite answered only born. Garland's examination of consciousness is written too lightly and sparcely for my liking. Lame ending.
2,So lame... (spoiler alert),"Okay, so The Coma had some nice turns of phrase, and Garland succeeded in weaving a swoony, disturbing tale that certainly piqued my interest, BUT... the ending was so much crap I can't even believe his editors let him get away with it. ""I woke up and it was all a dream?"" Boooooo! How stupid. He had the frame for a beautiful dark story, and completely wasted it."
2,No resolution,"I recently purchased this novel because I loved The Beach and was thoroughly entranced by the writing style involved in The Tesseract. Though Alex Garland's writing style is always (in my experience) amusing and unusual, I was definitely not a fan of this novel. Granted, as the covers stated, it was a book that was difficult to put down. However, it was sort of like watching a movie on pay-per-view and having your cable cut out before the last 30 minutes. It was very disappointing for that one aspect."
5,very different look from OEM,"I was afraid that I might have received the wrong item as it looked nothing like the switch that came off the car, but installed fine and works great."
2,pretty aweful,"Another guitarist that likes neck arobics instead of musik. Yes he is fast ( who isn't these days ), but he has nothing to say musicaly. The production is dreadful and the drum machine has one of the most horrid drum sounds in my extensive collection.The songs are meaningless and are nothing more than vehicles for more noodling with only snippets of melodie coming through. The sound is messy and the whole cd has not got a single highlight that would suggest better things may on the horizon. There are so many better offerings in this genre as to render this cd superfluous."
4,It's definitely for younger readers...,"I thought this book was very funny. Yes, the main character is very self-absorbed and whines a lot. That's the whole point. It's the diary of a 16 yr old self centered girl. I laughed out loud during many parts of it. It's a very quick read, too. I finished it in a few hours. It's not one of the greats of British literature, but I don't think it deserves such negative reviews. The book is just what it's meant to be."
1,Cognitive and Behavioral Treatment: Methods and Applications,I did not understand any of it. I wanted a book for self help with CBT. But this book was no help at all.
3,Much Better than last 4,"Still not as good as her medieval romances, but much better than her last 4 books. I actually was so interested in the story I skipped over the sex scenes. I was surprised that the hero couldn't figure out the connection sooner. Also, I was annoyed at the introduction of all of the annoying characters from the last few books. If you're new to her books, read her older books first."
1,Save time and money. Skip this book.,"I don't recall the author's other books being quite as bad as this one. I almost didn't make it to the end, but I did--and save yourself the trouble--it wasn't worth it. The hero and heroine were amoral, ""do as I say and not as I do"" characters who saw nothing wrong with orgies, pornography, or forgery.And what was with the heroine's other family members? An aunt/servant(?) who looked the other way no matter what her nieces did, including sexual misconduct and forgery. One sister who lived in la-la land except when she chose to come out of it and make perfect sense. One sister who was a cross-dresser. And the youngest sister who was constantly being pulled out of trouble if the others cared enough to check on her. I could go on with the problems in the book, but I think you get the gist."
3,"C, It's not bad, but then again...it's not great.","The theme of this book has been done a gazillion times. The names, settings, time period may have changed, but it's still bad boy meets good girl who fights urges to be seduced.BB: I want you. Let me ravish you.GG: Oh, no! I must be a proper woman. I have my reputation to keep.BB: But you want me to.GG: No. Yes! I mean no....Oh, yes! YES! YES!It could be a good book if it hadn't been done before or if there were aliens or an evil twin and good twin or circus midgets involved. Something to have spiced it up.Not worth paying full price, but then again if you need something to read and this book is handy, you could do worse."
3,Nothing spectacular about this one,"I'm not sure I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This typical storyline has been done over and over again that I've grown a bit tired of it. You know what I mean: the consummate bad boy, whom all the mothers warned their daughters about and all the wives, widows and spinsters dream of, meets a raving beauty who tames his wild heart. He fights a losing battle against his overwhelming attraction to her but eventually succumbs to the fate destiny has wrought for him.Of course, I was well aware of this going in to the book. I picked up it up only because I'm currently reading all of Madeline Hunter's books and I'd have to say that this one is her weakest. The characters were okay, albeit a bit unconvincing in their roles. The storyline was very predictable and the supposed attraction between Bride and Ewan seemed too contrived.Overall, I'd say you'd probably end up skimming through most of the story if you decide to read this book."
4,"okay, but no where near her best","This book was good - on par with most romance writers - but I was disappointed. Most of Hunter's books have me so enthalled I can't put them down; the storylines and characters are unique and well-developed. Her other books were suspenseful and kept me guessing as to what would happen next. In Lord of Sin, there were no surprises."
4,Not quite as good as others in the series.,"Whoever wrote here that Hunter books display characters different that those of other writers - is right on. There is a much darker edge to these lords and ladies - whether it is their shameless parties or their total disregard to the ton - all of the men in this series have had such a mystery to them. And Ewan was perhaps even more so than the others, might have been a greater addition to have seen him at his worst as the book began to get a true comparison because other than the references to his parties and his former life he almost seemed a little boring. I loved the characters though - Bride and Ewan were a compelling couple - and their story was beautifully written. Some of the mystery involving the engravings and forgery was a little too confusing but it did not totally overwhelm the book. There were some parts I think could have been a little better but overall a good book!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just look at the reviews...His mother and sisters loved it and the three people who bought the book at a rummage sale in Kalispell, Montana hated it. It is even missing a chapter. They forgot to print a chapter. This guy would be better off sticking with the DJ biz and the only writing he should do is endorsing the back of his paycheck. That is if he even has a job. As for story, cliche. You've heard them before and the new ones are of no interest to anyone. See for yourself if you don't believe this review. It is doubtful anyone will buy a copy. Give up the writing and do something realistic..."
1,Thoroughly Disappointing Book,"This is a typical, boring, poorly-written vanity-press book. I thought this one might be different, so I took a chance and bought it. I can't imagine anybody except this guy's friends or family actually enjoying the book. (I strongly suspect the good reviews were written by his friends) If you know the guy personally, or lived in his hometown then you probably would enjoy the references. Anybody else, save your time and money."
1,Worst buy EVER,"This is by far the least satisfied I have ever been with a purchase. Our dressers are less than 1 year old and (a) one arrived with a missing part, (b) the drawers never ran smoothly on the tracks and (c) two of the drawers have already broken beyond repair due to the sub-par material used to put this awful product together."
3,"mediocre, but there's not really anything else","very poorly edited and somewhat repetitive, this is the only reasonably credible source on trepanation you'll find as of early october 2003. if you're looking for treatment of the psychedlic perspective on self-trepanative enlightenment, look elsewhere; in four hundred pages, this pays roughly one paragraph's attention to modern elective trepanation, not that i personally think it's a very wise idea, anyhow. the first section of the book does give a very interesting account of the anthropological history of the modern interest in trephination, and this is without doubt the most comprehensive collection of data on the subject to date. however, especially towards the later essays, take it with a grain of salt - it's not consistently good science."
2,Very Disappointed,I thought this was a kit to make a sun catcher with beads instead it is for a middle school child to play with
2,Don't waste your money,"I'm an Asian so we cook rice a lot (twice a day). Tiger is a famous brand and we used to have a 4 cup and liked it very much. This one, however, is very disappointing! Within one year the bottom of the pot is worn out with very heavy scraches. We never used a metal spatula but the one comes with it. The rice also got burned at the bottom. The price was a little cheaper compared with other models but you got what you paid for. Actually it's not cheap if you think it only lasted one year."
2,Leave something up to me,I agree with another reader the author left nothing to the imigination. She told every aspect and detail and in a way I thought I was In an english class than on my own leisure time.
1,Did we all read the same book???,"As an aspiring author and someone who is taking the time and effort to study the craft, I was not impressed at all by this book. I feel bad about not supporting a Black author (which may come back to bite me later), however, the truth must be told. This book was full of narrative, had little dialog (stilted in some places, awkward in others)and the author basically told us a story rather than let us experience Amara and Keino's love for ourselves through wonderful dialog and skillful scene plotting. The saving grace for this book was learning about the Kenyan culture. That in itself made me pick up the book. I did finish the book but it was a struggle. Truth is, I did not want to completely waste my $6.99."
5,As good as La Recherche,"I read the original French edition of Tadie's book a few years ago. I had started reading La Recherche and after a few hundred pages I really wanted to know more about the author before continuing reading. I found in Tadie's book exactly what I was looking for. An excellent biography describing with enough details Proust's family, lifestyle, friends, places where he visited and so on. I can only recommend to all Proust's enthusiasts to read this book. La Recherche cannot be understood and fully appreciated without basic knowlegde about Paris social life at the beginning of the century and without knowing what Proust was doing at that time. It is often said that he was always sick and was spending all his days in his bedroom. Readers will discover that it is not exactly true and that it is thanks to the places that he visited and people he met that he could write one of the greatest books ever written."
2,What would Proust have thought?,"I picked up a copy of this book when I saw it marked down in price. I did not have to read very far before I discovered why the bookstore was unable to unload the large stock they still have on hand. The writing is simply atrocious.On every page there are non-sequiturs or convoluted sentence that are impossible to understand, even after reading them two or three times. The fault is not in the translation, which seems to be faithful to the original, but in the publisher who clearly made no attempt to edit the text properly.How ironic that a work about one of the greatest writers of modern literature should be presented in such a careless, clumsy way."
1,Close but no cigar,"This is a rambling leftist monologue (and I am a Democrat!) that is purportedly about scenario planning, save your money, you are much better served by purchasing ""The Art of the Long View"" by Peter Schwartz.The book is short on meaningful case studies and examples, it is more about political and philosophical ideas. That isn't necessarily bad, even if you disagree with the ideas. However what is lacking is using scenario planning to accomplish something, to bring your ideas into fruition"
5,A great place to start as a web designer!!!,This book is both comprehensive and understandable in relating both the importance of typography in web communication and using type/fonts correctly in composing a web site. It gives clear and insightful information about the design and use of typography in some of today's most widely used software. I enjoyed it very much as well as finding it very useful in designing my web pages.
2,Poor mixture of worlds,"Unfortunately, the first section of this book is written with ""document"" cut and pasted with ""web design"", so the relevance of what is said is limited for a web designer. The CSS guidelines are good, and the text as graphics section adequate."
3,It was okay,"It was pretty good, but I was sort of upset about two things. 1) The diaries were only of the girls. Okay, I know that guys usually don't keep diaries, but it still would have been nice to read them. 2) It was just a reapeat of books one- four. If you haven't read books one- four, than this is a good book, but if you have already read them, than it gets kinda boring. It was just a repeat of what happened in those books, only it was told from one persons point of view. Also, I thought that this book was going to be like a diarie starting from their childhood, up until this time. I thought it would tell more about their childhood, and personal feelings, but if you've read books one- four, than you already know what they were feeling, only its told in first person in this book, and third person in the other books. But, I guess it was okay. It was upsetting, though, so don't get your hopes up thinking that it'll be great, because it really isn't!"
3,An O.K. book,"If you have never read books 1-4 of Clearwater Crossing, you will like this book. I didn't read this book all the way through because it just repeated what I read in the first few books. That's why I only rated it 3 stars. I would recommend just reading books 1-4. I like Clearwater Crossing, and I am anticipating reading the latest book ""Prime Time"" #18, but this book was a waste of paper."
5,Love this!!!,"I am so pleased with this set! The quality is excellent and it looks even cuter in person than it did online! I can't wait for my baby boy to arrive so we can put the set to use! Also, I was very impressed that Amazon shipped it just a couple of hours after I placed my order. I am very impressed with the product and the quick service!"
2,didn't like it,"Although we were in love with the pattern, the comforter was was soft at all, hard around the edges and the bumper started to rip. Would not buy it again.Laura"
2,"not great, but not as bad as people are saying","If you are expecting ""Barely Legal/Girls Gone Wild""-type girls, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting bleached blonde, implant-type girls, you'll be disappointed. These are real women with real bodies. The action is tame, the comedy annoying, but if you want to see naked women playing tennis (badly) and showering, this may be for you."
4,Well done!,"This book is a succinct but well balanced overview of the history of the Christian spirituality. Especially I appreciate the author's perspective, which is the presence of God found in history. This perspective keeps reminding us of the central issue of Christian spirituality and our personal lives today: the presence of God. You won't regret spending time on it."
5,Easy as it gets,"Remove 3 screws from the lower steering column cover. Pull apart the upper and lower covers for access. Put the key in and lower the gearshift to neutral (provides room for pin to come out). Tap out the pin that holds the gearshift in place. Unplug the wire harness. Just slide the old one off, slide the new one on, and put it back together. 15-20 minutes and no big bill!"
1,The Piccolo Mute that does not fit the Piccolo Trumpet,"I had just recently bought a Tristart Piccolo trumpet and figured that it would to be too noisy for the small, close quarter community that I'm in. So the solution was to order a Silent Mute to let me practice in peace for the neighbors. However, this mute that I purchase does not fit my trumpet whatsoever. It is too small and the cork will not seal in the bell of the trumpet."
1,I was born in 1980.,"When I was a teenager, I found this book in my dad's basement. I also found a stash of ancient canned food. I experimented. The food was no longer edible. Then my dad told me that he had invested all the gifts I was given when I was little into a few gold coins. He then told me he lost the coins. Way to go Ruff."
2,Book fell apart,What can I say? The pages literally exploded out of the book when I first opened it. Good thing it was cheap and I only needed it to satisfy a class requirement.
2,Just for the Hits,"This album serves up the hits only. The rest of the songs have great guitar dynamics but that is the extent of it. ""Cabo Wabo"" is good, but not until you get to almost the end of the song, and that isn't cool. ""Mine All Mine"" is interesting, at the beginning of the song you don't know what you're in for, but the tone is a bit darker and it has kind of a catchy chorus. I use catchy losely, what I really mean it has a certain melody to it that appeals to me. It's not a bad album opener. Everything else is making me yawn. You may want to stick to the hits here, the fav has to be ""When It's Love"" and also ""Feels So Good"" those two songs make it worth the purchase, ""Finish What Ya Started"" is a good song as well. This album is too varied as far as good songs spread over ok songs thrown in with some terrible songs. It's too sketchy for me and is recommended for die-hards."
3,"Better than 5150, but nothing close to the Dave years","Songs like Cabo Wabo, Finish What YOu Started, and Black and Blue almost make you forget it is not David Lee Roth singing. BUt the rest of the album cant hold its own. There is no doubt about it, the Dave years were the best years."
3,SO SO,THIS IS THE SECOND CD WITH SAMMY HAGAR AND IT BY FAR DOSENT COME CLOSE TO THE FIRST SAMMY HAGAR CD 5150 AND NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE NEXT CD THEY THE ONLY TRACKS THAT MAKE THIS CD ALRIGHT IS WHEN ITS LOVE AND FINISH WHAT YOU GOT STARTED SO UNLESS YOUR A VAN HALEN NUT OR REALLY LOVE THOSE SONGS THIS IS NOT A CD TO CONCERN YOURSELF TRY ANY OF THE DAVID LEE ROTH CDS OR 5150
4,Always Liked it,"This album was released at a certain time in my life when I was a young and reckless man - nonetheless it was a period where I did enjoy myself and the circles I moved in. 'Mine all Mine' is a great track and in some ways sounds kind of 'futuristic'...then we have 'When its love' 'AFU' and 'Cabo Wabo'For me the second half of the album tapers off but I will always love the first few songs, for my own reasons. I look forward to a remastered version as I've always thought the sound could have been a bit better, but overall 4 stars for me. Easily beats albums like 'Diver Down', 'Fair warning', 'Women and Children First' and is better than at least 'Balance' of the Hagar era."
4,Ou...not bad but you got that Hagar guy,"Ou812 was musically a very good album with some poppy songs but like I noticed and alot of other reviewers noticed....where's the bass? Did Michael Anthony drop out for this one hoping that David Lee Roth would come back? Or did Eddie, Alex, and Sammy just turn down the bass volume on this one? Whatever, its ok and my highest rated VH album w/Hagar. So if u like Sammy...I would go out and buy it. Really I would. NOT!!!"
2,Disappointment,"While I thought ""Feels So Good' was okay, the rest of thealbum was below-par. ""When It's Love"" was too sappy, and""Finished What Ya Started"" had ridiculous lyrics. A real low point for VH."
3,Not as bad as I remembered,"Overall this is a pretty good listen. However, it also displays some of the problems of the early Hagar era, which I'll address point by point.1) Sounds like an uneven mixture of Van Halen type tunes and Hagar solo type tunes. ""Cabo Wabo"" sounds like VH, mostly. Songs like ""When It's Love"" sound like Hagar solo. Consequently, the album sounds rather inconsistent.2) The second album with a ""love"" ballad. Hagar will remain pretty consistent with this. He can be really sappy in one song, and then really crude in another. Here ""Black and Blue"" is his crude lyrics song, and also one of the stupidest.3) The drums. He's using some sort of drum triggers. Also, the production can be really shrill sounding - cymbals.4) Eddie should turn off the Eventide Harmonizer. His guitar tone is WAAAAAYYY overprocessed.So, in summary, it's ok, but completely non-essential Van Halen."
2,My Last Van Halen Album,"I just can't get into Sammy Hagar's singing with Van Halen.He has a OK voice,but somethings missing.I've even enjoyed some of his own recordings,but 0U812 will be my last Van Halen CD.1984 was a Masterpiece.The band was a fun group,now there old Men,singing about Doing it untill we're ""Black and Blue."" What a joke.""Finish What Ya Started,"" was the reason I bought this CD in the late 80's.It's the best cut on the album.If anyone wants to buy this record from me, you can have it for a buck."
4,"""Done And Plenty""","OU812 is the second album with Sammy Hagar. Sammy Hagars singing on this record proves that SAMMY HAGAR is the best singer that Van Halen has had. The album Kicks off with the hard rock song ""Mine All Mine."" The most popular song on here is ""When It's Love."" This record has a lot of Heavy Metal/Hard Rock tunes on it. The only comlained that I have is that Eddie's guitar playing changed a lot on this album. He use to be a guitar god, but now he makes a bunch of noise. And thats the only complaint that I have. It is a great record."
5,ou812,"make NO mistake, this is a stellar rock effort. while there are some fillers here, its worth the price alone for feels so good, cabo wabo, and afu, you can almost see the white sands and sunny beaches in eddies sound on this particular album. highly listenable and enjoyable, and an overall good feeling album. its not as earth shaking as some of thier previous efforts, but then this album doesn't really set out to be. and keeping things in perspective, even a less than earth shattering van halen album such as this is still far and away more creative and enjoyable an album than most other rock band's crowning efforts. five star rating. (and for those who haven't quite figured out the meaning in the title, as there seems to be a few of you here who haven't including daniel durchholz' editorial review,shame on you, try looking at some of diamond dave's albums around the same time frame.) ;)"
3,dullest of the sammy albums,"but still very good. the singles and fast songs are great, but the filler is not up to 5150 standards. but like I keep saying, what else are you going to buy, VHIII? Not."
5,EXCELENTE¡¡¡¡¡¡,"VAN HALEN ES EL MEJOR GRUPO DE HARD ROCK QUE HA EXISTIDO Y SIN DUDA SE DEBE A LA CALIDAD DE SU MUSICA, MAS QUE A SUS VOCALISTAS, LA PERSONALIDAD DE LEE SIEMPRE FUE UNA SOMBRA SOBRE HAGAR, PERO LO SUPO ENFRENTAR CON SUS INTERPRETACIONES Y SUS DOTES DE GUITARRISTA, SIN EMBARGO EL TITULO DE GUITARRISTA SOLO LE CORRESPONDE A EDDIE, EN CONCLUSION, MUSICALMENTE HABLANDO, OU812 FUE EL PARTEAGUAS DE LA CARRERA DE VAN HALEN, DONDE MADURA Y MUESTRA SIN INHIBICIONES LA PROPUESTA DE LO QUE ES EL AUTENTICO ROCK."
3,It's Good Enough...,"Rumored to be a response to Roth's ""Eat 'em and Smile""('Oh, you ate one too'-Get it?)this 1988 release cements Sammy's place in the band.(for about 8 more years, anyway) There are about a handful of mediocre rockers, like ""Source of Infection"", which is pretty much ""Hot for Teacher"" part II, but not as endearing. This album also bears witness to some of the dumbest Hagar lyrics yet.(""Let's do it 'till we're black and blue?!?"") ""Cabo Wabo"" is alright and I can tolerate ""Finish What Ya Started"" but tunes like ""Feels So Good"" send me screaming back to the Dave albums. There's too many power ballads and even the rockers seem to say ""Hey, we can still rock, c'mon! Hey, where are you going?"" It's just not the same anymore. Yeah, Sam can sing, and yeah, he seemed to reenergize the mighty Van Halen, but the cost is musical felony. Then again, I really couldn't see Roth singing this audio swill."
4,Ludwig von Halen or Eddie van Beethoven?,"Am I the only one who even noticed when this album first came out that the chorus of ""When It's Love"" is a fairly straight rip-off of the chord progression and to a lesser degree the tune to which Beethoven set Schiller's poem ""Ode to Joy"" in the finale of his 9th Symphony? Don't believe me? Hum the well known ""Ode to Joy"" tune during the chorus of ""When It's Love"" and hold the last three notes of the melody twice as long as Beethoven gave them. See what I mean? As Willie Nelson once told Johnny Cash, ""Good songwriters borrow, great songwriters steal."" Overall this was probably Van Halen's best post-DLR album."
2,"No, it doesn't work this time either","On a T-shirt I read ""Give me Van Halen or give me head"". If you give me ""Van Halen I"" and ""Van Halen II"", I might consider the options, but if it's about this album, I sure wouldn't hesitate going for the head thing. What happened? Van Halen started out as a great band but have gradually lost it. And bringing on Sammy Hagar sure didn't make things better. ""OU812"" is just mediocre at best. The opening track, ""Mine all mine"" is the albums' highlight."
3,Oh You Ate One Too,"This is the second Van Halen album with Sammy Hagar on vocals. From the opening track Mine All Mine its Christian standpoint is revealed. Key tracks are: When It's Love, Finish What You Started and Black & Blue. Stryper named Van Halen as the best band of all time. They went for quantity over quality. But still not bad."
4,OU812,"Van Halen's second album with Sammy Hagar at the mike. This time Van Halen opens the formula up a bid with song like Finish What Ya Started with the country styled picking. The metalic Mine all Mine opens the album. OU812 is not one of my favorite Van Halen albums, but it is one of Van Halen's most expermential and interesting albums."
4,I still play it.,"Though I also like the David Lee Roth era, because of my age I'm more of a ""Van Hagar"" person. I don't think this is as great as ""5150"", but it is the next best thing. Included here are the big hits ""When It's Love"" and ""Finish What Ya Started"", as well as the minor hits ""Black And Blue"" and ""Feels So Good"". I also really like the opener ""Mine All Mine"", and ""Cabo Wabo"". Overall it's a very solid album, and probably my fourth favorite over the course of their entire career, after ""5150"", the debut, and ""1984"". If you like their late 80's material, also check out ""Sammy's"" solo 1987 album ""I Never Said Goodbye""."
3,Ou81what?!,"Well, this album ain't bad, I'm not sure if this band really can make a clunker (not without Gary Cherone, anyway). I am less taken with this one than most though. Eddie and the boys are foolin' around with stuff that isn't in their league with ""(A) Apolitcal Blues"" and ""Finish What Ya Started"" and those aren't even half bad! But my favorites are still the kickin' songs ""A.F.U.,"" ""Mine all Mine"" and less kickin' ""Cabo Wabo."" Ed again is playing too much with the synths, as he has been since ""Diver Down"" but he'd fix that by '91."
4,"Fun, yet dated","Once again, the electronic drums mar some of Van Halen's most loose, fun songs. However, I can't let this minor criticism get in the way of the songs themselves. This album contained another huge power ballad, ""When It's Love"", and the bluesy romper ""Finish What Ya Started"", along with the vaguely spiritual lyrics of the opener ""Mine All Mine"" and the raunchy 7-minute rocker ""Cabo Wabo"". A particular favorite of mine is the [physical]-fueled ""Black and Blue"": love that riff! Although over-looked these days in favor of other Van Halen album, this is a must-have for all Van Halen and especially Sammy Hagar-era fans."
2,"Weak, irregular and too pop...","THe opener track ""Mine all Mine"" is very good, with a great vibe. Then comes ""When It's Love""... well, it's a good ballad, be you a fan of ballads or not. Then the rest is strange, weird, irregular, a freak. THe worst Hagar album."
2,Ok....but there are better,While I love VH and also am a Hagar fan this cd isn't really worth picking up other than to finish your collection. None of the songs are very engaging and to be honest I actually had to look at the track listing to remember what was on it. My lack of memory wasn't due to not being informed it was in fact due to remembering that there really wasn't anything note worthy on it (and I had to check the list to make sure I wasn't mistaken). I have most all of VH's cds and this one is played the least in my collection.
5,It rocks!!,"It's nice to get an old CD that is new and not been used. I use to go to second hand music stores to find the old stuff but now I can get it here. And the music is great, I love all of Van Halen's music."
4,not as immediate as 5150 but grows on you,"This is the second round of Van Halen reborn as a Zeppelin'esque hard rock band with the powerhouse singer Sammy Hagar. It introduces 5 iconic tunes : the superb Mine All Mine, Cabo Wabo, Black and Blue, Finish What Ya Started, and When Its Love. The two heavy rockers AFU and Sucker in a 3-piece mirror early Van Halen songs I'm the One and Van Halen. Feels So Good is a Genesis like melodic rock tune, very sophisticated stuff. The sound, overall, is uneven. It needs to be remixed first, then remastered to give it a second life."
4,"Van Halen - Good, But Not Great","The second of the Van Hagar era albums is fairly similar to the first one. The title is a jab at David Lee Roth's first solo album ""Eat Em And Smile"". The keyboards are toned down a bit on this one, compared to the last two and the guitar more up front for the most part. Hagar's lyrics are a mix of attempted profundity and juvenile sexist schlock like the first single ""Black And Blue"". The album produced several huge hits most notably ""Finish What Ya Started"", and ""When It's Love"" both slightly atypical of Van Halen's usual fare. Hager includes what has become one of his theme songs in the infectious ""Cabo Wabo"" where he now famously owns the famous Cabo Wabo Cantina nightclub in Cabo San Lucas Mexico. For the most part if you like ""5150"" you will probably like this one as well. I rate them about the same with Hagar in fine voice and Van Halen screaming on guitar. Good stuff for the most part, but not great."
5,Perfect!!,"These valances are excellent quality! Also, the size is perfect so you only have to buy one per regular-sized window. These are even cuter in person than they looked online. I would definitely recommend this product!"
3,Pixel Car,"This car doesn't seem to react at all with my daughter's Pixel Chix house -- we hook it up, and have a chick in the house, and a chick in the car, with no interaction. The instructions are virtually non-existent, but seemingly imply that all you need to do is just ""hook them up"" together and it will work. We went to the website, but it doesn't even talk about the car.It's fun for my daughter, but she's a bit frustrated, having paid for the car herself."
4,Caine is human after all,"This book shows that Knief truly is interested in writing a good story. After the first three, I had the suspicion that the Knief was headed down ""The Executioner"" track and would become just another ""superhero confronts the bad guys"" author with shallow plots and endless action. It appears from this book that he actually wants to inject some depth and breadth into his characters. Others have dissected the plot of this story in their reviews so I won't be redundant.If you want to see how an author grows with his character and how he changes when he wants to treat his audience with respect, read this series from the beginning. It will be time well spent. I hope that book 5 when it emerges will continue this trend."
3,"Twice as long, twice as slow","Longer than usual, this entry has great action sequences but slows to a crawl at other times. Characters are introduced and then disappear for unexplained reasons. Not as good as the last entry and a long way to go before rivaling Travis McGee."
2,"Great for small stuff, Bad for real jobs.","If you want to change the oil, bulbs, plugs it's OK. If you want to change the valve cover on a 1986 forget it. Your better off to find your own way around the EGR on the passenger's side. Chilton is still king."
1,It's a lie..,"I was super hopeful about this product since I'm very fussy about the way my hands smell, especially in restaurants, which often use surprisingly nasty-smelling soap. I thought I could just carry it in my purse and use it after washing my hands. It really doesn't work, though. I've tried an aluminum one in the past that made my hands smell like aluminum, then faded after a few minutes taking the soap smell with it, but I try to avoid aluminum products so I was hoping this one would have a similar effect. It has pretty much zero effect. I wanted to give two stars because I like the shape but there's no point if it doesn't work for me.It fell out of my pocket while I was waiting to catch a plane and the flight attendant happened to see it and bring it on the plane just before takeoff- she was like, ""Did anyone lose a metal... soap.. thing?"" And everyone gave me funny looks after I claimed it. Too bad I couldn't tell them how great it was for removing odors."
3,"Very small and not solid, great price though!","This is about the size of an egg, and its hollow. The workmanship is uninspiring, but for the price seems about right. If I feel like it works well, I'll probably invest in a nicer one since we cook a lot."
1,Unrelated,I took the Dante's test last night. What a waste of 30.00 this book was! The material in the book was nothing like the material covered on the exam. The exam is straightforward and seemed easy (I finished in 35 minutes).Don't waste your money on this.
1,Beware of Pet Tabs!!!,"Pet Tabs were tested by Consumerlabs and found to contain high levels of lead. (This was in the tablet form, not the liquid form we used.) So we have decided to discontinue using this product and are looking for a safer alternative."
4,Just for the basics,"This product is helpful to give you a basic tutorial of simple interaction phrases within the TWI dialect. The words and phrases that you learn will be useful if you are a tourist and need directions on getting places, or if you just want to be polite and courteaous to show that you made an effort to learn the native language.I was dissapointed though to find that the lessons did not go onto a higher level of complexity. The lessons here are very simple and the tapes have a lot of blank space at the end of each lesson I am still searching for Twi audio tapes that have higher levels of difficulty."
4,Good Review of Twi Tapes,"I'm glad I purchased the Twi tapes. I had been looking for a self-teaching Twi language system for a while. They fit my needs. Now you need to come out with an advanced version, Twi II. Thanks."
4,Great!,This book is about Bolan taking revenge on drug lords. That said the author has done a fantastic job. I'd like to read more by Alan Philipson. Buy this one! END
1,Incomplete set - neither boxed,What I received was neither boxed nor a set of 5 to 8. Book 7 was missing and the other three books were not boxed either. Very misleading description!
5,My children love these books!,My children read these books all the time and beg for more! They have read them over and over. It helped my second grader improve his reading skills. Thank you!
4,Great books for younger kids,We introduced this series to our 3 year old and they are the first chapter books to really capture his attention. The books have a simple enough plot for him to follow and they all are about an interesting topic that immediately pulls him in.I saw the review of a teacher slamming the series for it's poor use of grammar. I think that it is more important to grab a child's attention rather than making sure grammar is always perfect. All in all I think this is a good series for young kids and we will continue to read them to our boy to keep him excited about reading.
4,Good series,My sons like these books and the series. They are nicely illustrated and written. We always like reading these at night before bed.
5,kids choice,"Kids of all ages love these books,both boys and girls find this series of stories fun and enjoyable."
5,WOW!!,"My children have always LOVED to read, but when I purchased these for my youngest son's birthday (my boys are 6 & 7), the reaction I received after reading the first book was AMAZING! They cried when we had to stop for the night to go to bed and started begging the next morning to keep reading. These books are PERFECT for young imaginations. I will be purchasing the remaining sets as well."
5,Bought them form my grandson,My 6 year old grandson is reading on a 5th grade level and I have taught 5th grade. These are perfect books for that age. They are appropriately written to engage a young mind and help them improve their reading skills. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a child between 6 and 11. I guarantee they will love it. It's packed with fun adventures and the two main characters are a girl and boy so it will keep all the little ones happy!
1,Poor Example,"I am a first grade teacher and I beg you to NOT get any of these books. They are a terrible example for children learning to write. One of the many strategies I teach my students to use while spelling and writing is to ask themselves, ""Does it look right?"" because so much of what is taught is reinforced by exposure and experience. With the MTH books being such poor examples of grammar, sentence structure, and story development, what these children are learning (or un-learning) is detrimental. What in the world were the editor and author thinking??? They should be ashamed. I came on to write an honest review because there are so many that praise this series and I am glad to see there are people who realize how important correct grammar and syntax are in children's literature. I really thought I was alone due to the bizarre popularity of these books."
5,Magic Tree House Collection is wonderful!,"My four year old daughter loves the books. For her age group the only downside is ""not enough illustrations"". But that does not stop her from asking to have two chapters read to her each night."
5,Great read for second grader!,My son is in second grade but reads at a 4.1 level so I got these for him in hopes that it would spur him into a desire to read for fun...boy it worked! He read them all in 2 days and asked for more. Great content and easy flow with good plots twists and character carry-over.
5,Magic Tree House boxed set,"My granddaughter requested these books for Christmas, and she loves them. That's the best reason to love the whole set."
5,Best books,"We LOVE ""Jack and Annie"" books at our house. I read them to my 5 and 7 year old almost every night. The adventures are so much fun and each book has a history lesson that is easy for kids to understand."
5,Very helpful and user-friendly,"Very helpful and user-friendly; writing style flows well, exercises are well instructed. I'm glad my instructor chose this book."
5,A must for college students,"This is a thorough read for students getting started in college. While I am not new to college, I recently returned to college and this was required reading. It is very helpful. It teaches good organizational habits and time management."
5,All students should read this book!,Very informative. Great excercises and current ideas and suggestions. Many ways of acclimating yourself to your studies are common sense.
3,"Good book - Students may need ""Research Navigator""","Many students may need ""Research Navigator"" which is an included element with the book in new copies. You may wish to be certain a used copy did indeed have it, as my used copy was described as ""good"" condition despite missing this element.It appears this element is access to a site, which allows you in by registering with a serial number with the book.If you do buy a used copy you most likely may not get this, but you can purchase access for 15 dollars at [...] in the event your book does not have a serial number to allow you to register an account for free."
1,Very Unhappy,"As a first time user of this site I am not happy at all. I ordered on 3/14/09. Credit card was charged 3/15/09. The Est. delivery date was 3/20-4/6. Contacted the seller 3 times, have not gotten a response. I""M NOT HAPPY. I'm hoping that the Amazon site will refund what my credit card was charged. I assumed since the seller had 4 1/2 stars that it would be dependable, I assumed wrong. Please help me so that I don't have to ever visit this site again. Something should be done about this seller, because the Amazon site was highly recommended to me. But with one bad seller is like having one bad apple spoils the bunch."
1,Not a great read,"As a first grade teacher and the parent of a seven year old, I find this entire series quite horrible! I know that the school in the book is supposed to be wacky, but I dislike characters in children's books that claim to hate school. I hate the overuse of the word ""dumb"" as well as all the bathroom humor. Of course my son loves it for those very same reasons. I just don't think it's necessary to include that stuff in children's literature. There are plenty of great kid's books out there - I'm encouraging my son to read those instead. also, the characters are mean to each other and there's a lot of teasing that goes on - aren't we all working really hard to make sure that stuff doesn't happen to our kids? Give me the Magic Tree House any day!"
4,Episode List for this Disk,"A blast from the past!Here is the Episode List for ""Vol. 2"" [my copy was not labeled that way]--Grandpa's Christmas Visit--Bob In Orbit--Grandpa Moves West--Bob and the Dumb Blonde--Bob Helps Anna Maria--Wolf Sitter--Bob Plays Margaret's Game--Bob Digs Rock 'N Roll"
3,"Ok, but no more than that","It is worthy reading but the story does not add too much to the today's levels of common understanding both of USSR and left ""intellectuals"" who served and are still serving it."
4,Very handy!,I ordered this book for my medical billing practice because I needed a smaller paperback book for quick reference. Every definition that I have needed to look up has been in this book. It is very simple to follow and is easy to use. I would recommend this book to any who will look up words on a daily basis and does not want to have to lug out a 20 pound hardback dictionary!
4,"A good, inexpensive general medical reference",This is a great medical dictionary for those who want a comprehensive reference and not spend too much money. We recommend this book for students in our medical vocational classes.
1,NOT recommended,I purchased this for my kindle to make it easy to carry around for my massage training & found I was not able to do a search to get to specific words. The only way I was able to navigate was to page through. Very disappointing & time consuming. I also found words missing that I felt should have been included in a medical dictionary.
5,Medical dictionary,It is excellent for its size and weight. I couldnn't handle an unabridged medical dictionary.
2,Not very thorough.,I got this as a quick reference at the start of my health care related program. I've had to use the internet or other books several times to supplement this book.I'd research some other desk top/pocket dictionary before getting this one.
1,Question: Any pronunciation guide for the entries?,How come no one in the reviews ever giving any info about the pronunciation guide used in the Dictionary? Can someone tell us if the IPA (International Phonectic Aiphabet)or KK phonetic symbols are used in this dictionary to help reader to know the pronunciation of each symbols? I may give it a higher rating when I get some answers.
1,Deserves less than a star,"This book was a mega disappointment. Its binding was of inferior quality and didn't provide any 'actual swatches'; just photocopies of fabrics...you can get that from any fabric website for free. Putting a square patterned paper next to a diagram of a window treatment do not work with trying to picture how the actual thing will look. You're better off closing your eyes and visualizing on your own. If you're totally at a loss for ideas, many other curtain books are much better than this waste of paper."
3,trays,"These look cool with the decor on the trays compared to regular boring trays, but when we got ours, which was a little pricey, it had a few very noticeable scratches that had been painted over to try to cover up, but the paint looked tacky on those spots because it beaded up. I was a little disappointed. Otherwise, they are very cute and functional."
3,Good T.V. trays rack leaves room for improvement,"The T.V. Trays are great, however the tray holder/rack you must assemble and is very cheap and does not hold up well. I had to build my own holder/rack just after I assembled the original rack/holder."
2,Cheap wood (press board),Made from Cheap wood (press board) Screws were to small and stripped out during assembly of stand for tables. Had to go buy different screws. For $150 You should get quality...Tops are made using a big pressure sticker. Not applied well.Looks cheap!!
5,Great Nautical Trays!,The trays were just what we were looking for. Very durable and at a great price. We shopped other stores in our area and they were charging $30 to $40 dollars more than Amazon's price.
5,I love this series!,"I love this series. I have read the first 4 books so far and my testimony of the Gospel has grown so much. I'm sixteen years old and I recommend this series to anyone and everyone, even if you aren't a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They are wonderful books and everyone should read them."
4,Refreshing!,"This CD is a mixture of New Orleans Jazz and rhythm & blues. Its contents cover general christian culture and I found this to be very tasteful, authentic, and refreshing. She has a very smooth and soulful style. If you appreciate versatility in your gospel collection, I would recommend this! Some selections allow you to jam while others may encourage a groove, so get your jam and groove on!"
3,"Live, but it's alright","Live from the House of Blues is OK. I bought the CD when it came out, but I haven't been playing it that much. I believe Lisa's voice is better on studio projects. Her voice doesn't sound that great, but since she was expecting that may have been a factor with Lisa's sound. Soul Music was good, but this CD did not meet my expectations. ""Move on Over"" was not a good choice for the single. I'm not sure what to say about this CD, but it's not bad.My favorites are ""Just Another Day,"" ""You Can,"" ""Uphold Me,"" and ""About Your Love For Me."""
5,SOULICIOUS,"THIS WAS THE FIRST LISA MCCLENDON ALBUM I BOUGHT AND I'M IN LOVE IT. FOR GOSPEL SOUL IT IS PRETTY GOOD. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS LISTENING TO GOSPEL BUT TO SOUL MUSIC ABOUT MY GOD AND THATS MY FAVORITE TYPR OF MUSIC. THIS CD MAKES ME WANNA THROW AWAY ALL MY SECULAR SOUL MUSIC!!!!GET IT, YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED!!"
2,wrong battery sent but refund granted,The specifications of the battery I purchased (i.e. mAh and V) were not what was sent to me and what I needed for my cordless phone. I sent a message to the seller and they immediately refunded my money although they didnt send me a new battery. So they sent me the wrong battery but refunded my money and told me to dispose of it properly. I would have rather received the correct battery for my phone since it still has a bad battery but the company did me well by refunding my money. They shouldn't advertise one battery and send another though.
5,Excellent replacement battery,Excellent replacement battery for my uniden power max hand sets. The battery has a higher capacity than the stock one but works flawlessly. It gave a new lease of life to my phones thereby saving atleast $100 that would have gone to buy a new set.
2,Replacement Battery for Uniden Phones,I did not realize I was one size off in getting the proper replacement battery size. Now I am stuck trying to sell 4 batteries that I can not use.I promised never to own Uniden products again in this life time.
3,There so much better available,"For your money, you are probably better off spending more and getting something more comprehensive. Yes, it is basically a dictionary, but if you are after a good reference, get the 'Ship model builders assistant', or go the whole hog, 'Anatomy of Nelson's ships'. It contains little in the way of diagrams, and is very limited in its variance of ships."
2,Disappointment,"The video itself would be OK if it didn't have these annoying pauses. I know this happens in some DVD's, but when I mentioned it to the vendor, they didn't seem to care about my problem."
3,The Art of Organization,"This is a great book poorly organized. I had heard allot about this book from within the wooden, model ship-building circles, and when I found a copy was dissapointed. Primarily, for the retail price, I was expecting allot more book, allot better organized, with much better plates, for allot less money. I decided to wait until I found a inespensive second hand copy and did so for a measely AUD$$$ in perfect condition.Everything other reviewers have said stands in regards to this work so I won't reiterate those points. The only observation I would like to make is that the next publishers update this work and appoint an editor to re-organize it to the benefit of those who in future wish to purchase it. Until that time this work, notwithstanding it's period, novelty value, will remain short of it's of fullest and most useful potential. Having said all that though, for $7 nearly as new, I am proud to have it on my shelf and recommend it to others at this price."
1,This band defines what evil music is all about....,"If you like hardcore devil music, this is the band for you. If you like just listening to the music and not caring about the lyrics that there singing, or if your into satan, this is your band........Musically this band has talent, but there lyrics make me want to burn the album. Thats why I no longer own this cd."
4,Good,"Cool local band, very good CD I went to see them at trinity but they had no bassist at the time, I was bummed."
3,better than a travel guide,"This was a nice book to read before I left for Sydney. Gave me a bit of a different perspective than a travel guide would, while still offering plenty to explore."
2,"Does the job, but doesn't last","This did well at dissipating heat while I was soldering. The big downside was the the clamp end would slip off the wires I clipped it too. Also the spring pops of easily, and if you lose it, the heat sink is useless."
5,Excellent resource,"Angela Hunt's book is great. It made me nod my head in agreement many times and laugh out loud at some of the examples given. It was a great book with good Christian guidelines that we will be using with our 12 year old. I don't remember having as much drama with my son as I do with my step-daughter and after reading this book I could see a lot of things that related to her. Thanks for the helpful tips! This one will be staying on my kindle until my step-daughter goes to high school. Hoping you will have a ""My life as a high school mom"" by then."
5,A fun book to be sure! The Artist's perspective!,"Hello,Scott Neely here. I drew the Scooby-Doo Snack-a-thon book! It came out really nice. All the art was taken from previous Scooby-Doo books that I had drawn and so the main bulk of my work was done. The main thing that I had to create for this book were all the stickers for all of the different kinds of foods that Shaggy and Scooby eat. It was fun to do, and a real different kind of research that I had to do for this project."
3,VERY modern blues!,"Chris Thomas King is a very talented musician who has put out some very good albums in the past. His latest ""Me, My Guitar and the Blues,"" is not strictly blues, and blues purists would not be happy. The absence of authentic drums and a player really takes away from what this album could have been. King has put many different modern elements in this album that take the raw feeling out of this album. Infact, during ""Born Under a Bad Sign,"" King raps a verse and on ""Cain"" he raps nearly the entire song. The songs are good, very catchy. The drum kit could have been left behind I think though. There is a very modern day R&B feel to this album. I could swear I have heard the title track on MTV's jams before, it is a beautiful song none-the-less."
4,Take a listen to Chris Thomas King,"I immediately bought Me, My Guitar and the Blues because Chris Thomas King's previous cd Red Mud was so good. I was expecting great things from the son of blues man Tabby Thomas. King switched labels with this albums and appears to be experimenting with sounds and styles with this cd.Chris Thomas King starts with a haunting minor key blues song called Why Blues. In this song he uses some scratching techniques. He includes a couple of soul inspired songs - Stay Just as You are and You are My Heaven. These are not to my taste. He also has a rap styled song called Cain. His straight up blues are excellent. Like Father, like Son, Gambling woman, Bourban Street Blues and Stones in My Passway are excellent.I applaud King for experimenting with sounds and hope he finds a groove that is comfortable for both himself and blues fans."
3,...not enough blues in his blues...,"...i loved his role in ""o, brother where art thou?"" and that is what prompted me to pick up this disc, the brother has skills...he just didnt showcase them here in a proper fashion.his blues joints on this are tight...and although i love me some hip-hop(and his raps aint all the way bad) it takes away from what i was expecting. he has another cd based on his ""o, brother..."" character which is probably more of what i want to hear; i will be gettin that cd soon.this isnt a bad cd, just not what i was expecting...hard to be up for some serious blues and then not get it; that's a true heartache!"
5,Awesome CD,This is a good CD by one of my favorite NEW Bluesman Chris Thomas King. He was really good in O Brother Where Art Thou too. His music is different by bonding a bit of hip-hop techno to an old blues melody. He has made a niche for himself in a world of blues music by fusing genres together. Try him out... he has several really good CD's out. Buy on Amazon and save money....I did.
2,Strange Relationship,"I was loooking forward to this book after reading one other by this auther. I was disappointed that the author had to two main characters involved in a serious relationship before they discovered whether they were related. That seemed really outside the boundries of acceptable behavior. I do like how the author writes, and I will read other books, but this one is not a keeper."
5,Fit and works better than the original.,"Had same ones in 25 year old breaker box. These breakers look updated and better built than the old ones. If you are adding as an additional breaker, be sure you have room. Most breaker boxes have a limited number of spaces for these type breakers. Double breakers have a lip on them to prevent them from being installed in every slot in your box. Check your box first, you may have to move some around to free up space on your box for these doubles."
1,Worse Music cd ever,I tried putting this in a shredder and it broke the shredder I was using that's how bad the music was.
2,The Love Interest - Bedazzled,"Bedazzled is a very catchy song and I enjoyed it a lot. Seems to me though that the remixes, for the most part, are very much unnecessary, they are either too similar or too obscure, not really anything solid. All you really need is one of these mixes and then you can move on with your life. I like the Blue Velvet Mix, but it is very short. I would have to say this is a nice effort, but why form a new project just to release one song? Perhaps Chris Connelly was trying to follow in Al Jourgensen's footsteps, but folks, this is no Acid Horse. A nice try, but he could have done better with this release."
4,Memorable Writing from Steve Almond,"""The Evil BB Chow and Other Stories"", like all of Steve Almond's writing, is honest, explicit and hefty. Covering themes of unfulfilled longing, deep friendship, physical intimacy, and family ties, the stories in this book are about what connects people and what pulls them apart. The characters range across the cultural landscape of America-Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass are portrayed, as are immigrants, graduate students, the young, the old, the eccentric, the marginal and the upwardly mobile. These characters are morally complex, hungry, flawed and memorable.I'm also sold on ""The Evil BB Chow"" because it so clearly pushes the use of language. It is commandingly well-crafted writing. The stories are infused with intensely beautiful visual descriptions; nearly poetry.This is a deeply satisfying book that continues to reward me after a second and third reading. Strange, gorgeous stuff."
5,almond does it again,"darker, more poetic, steve almond is at his best with the evil bb chow. a wonderful read for fans of earlier work or a good introduction for those unfamiliar. his signatures - compassion, humor and of course hot sex - are all over this. highly recommended for anyone interested in short stories told with urgency and insight into the way humans treat each other and view themselves."
3,Good book for a long flight or a weekend getaway,"The collection of short stories are snappy enough to keep you turning the pages. Starting from the front of the book, the quality wanes as you go deeper. The other reviews go into greater detail about each story, so I won't repeat that here.I picked up my copy for less than $3, so I'm not going to judge the book harshly. At that price, it was better entertainment than an in-flight movie or a magazine from the airport gift shop."
2,Not Recommended,"SOOOO TINY! I was expecting something just a little larger.. It was insanely small, im almost embarrased to give it to someone"
3,Gel Filter is ok,The filter works ok however the little metal closures bend the wrong way. I already have to find replacements for them. I also wish that the holder was a little bit wider then what it is. But I will have to make it work for now
1,Idiotic,"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to exploit other artists that are more successful than him. I doubt any one besides Martin Atkins has seen a penny from Pigface sales, do not buy anything from this guy, he is not worthy of your hard earned money."
5,Delightful read!,"Not too long of a book, but you probably won't want to put it down. It brings a story to life from English history that we don't hear that much about, and yet, it seems like it is a story that needs to be told. You will enjoy this book if you like historical fiction of the Henry VIIIth variety!"
2,Disappointed,"Let me begin by saying that I love Alison Weir. I've read most of her non-fiction historial works and found them to be well-written, engrossing, and instructive. However, I think that in order to tell Lady Jane Grey's story, she should have stuck to her forte--dealing in facts.It was a good idea to indicate which character was speaking at the beginning of their respective narratives, because there were no defining characteristics between each of the players. Each one had the same voice, the same level of self-awareness, and the same manner of speaking. Perhaps the novel would have been stronger if narrated by a third person.Ms. Weir is a great historian, but the historical novels are best left to Philippa Gregory or Sharon Kay Penman."
4,The Innocent Traitor,A wonderful book!!!!! I read it in 24 hours----it was so interesting I did not want to put it down. It is written with so much feeling and so accurate for this period of history.
4,Engrossing study of 16th Cen. power politics,Recommended--Engrossing study of power politics and women in 16th Cen. England.
2,Lady Jane,"I did not dislike this book, in fact it was a fairly good read and I enjoyed it. However throughout the entire novel I couldn't help but feel that Weir had not quite stepped away from her ""historian's voice"". Whole sections of it could very well have been in one of her legendary biographies, except the facts are set to dialogue.Descriptions of place, especially when the setting was in London, were dry and not really needed as I don't feel they did much to strengthen the story. And when Weir did step out of the box by placing Lady Jane at the burning of Anne Askew or having Queen Mary give Lady Jane a ruby necklace that looked like blood around her neck the tone of the novel changed for the better.I appreciate her accuracy and it's definitely better than being annoyed by inaccuries when reading historical fiction, but I couldn't help but wish Weir had had more fun with the fact she was writing a novel while still staying within the lines of history."
5,Bravo!,"Bravo Alison Weir!!! Innocent traitor was a pleasure to read! Intelligent, exciting and well-written. I look forward to your next fiction books!"
4,Unlucky to be named Jane,"I really unjoyed this book.Poor Jane,, a total inncocent.All she wanted were her books and her faith it seemed.For me, it's been a bit tough to find anything on this Jane or Jane Rochford. I already read Vengence Is Mine, but I won't go there here.This womanchild was so dominated by her parents, to the point of child abuse.You really feel for Jane, her life is nothing like she had hoped it would be.She was used til the very end. The crown was put upon her head for nine days...nine days!It's truly a wonder how some slept at night back then. They would have had no concious whatsoever.I reccomend this book, it's a good but sad read."
4,british history,"I as a person from the UK who reads a LOT of british history - fiction and non-fiction - I found this to be a very fascinating book expressing how a woman from that era would have felt. I have researched history from UK and find the politics and sexual opinions accurate and feel maybe women should have been viewed as the superior sex lol! Jane died to save a barren females crown because Mary Tudor married a foreigner to try and reproduce - instead she developed dropsy - I am sure Bloody Mary (Mary Tudor for the uninitiated to UK HIstory), knew about her inability to do this due to her age and family history and took her spite out on any-one blood relative or innocent. Hence the burnt at the stake edict. And I am sure Jane was innocent due to being controlled by the inferior male sex and bad advice - or should that read bad commanders??? Read it - it is enlightening to tudor male attitudes to women."
4,Beach Read,"I love the fact that Alison Weir wrote Historical Fiction! Yeah. For that she gets 4 stars! But the novel itself isn't really ""all that"" and I was glad to be done with it."
5,awesome book,"This book was required for one of my college classes. It's a very good book but inappropriate for young kids. I really enjoyed reading it, and it helped me remember stuff for history class because it is a true story"
3,Lady Jane was a self-righteous prig,"Okay, that may or may not be true, but that's how she came across in this book. I LOVE Ms. Weir's biographies and have devoured all of them. Unfortunately, this book fell flat for me. I didn't really like Jane Grey while reading this, though I've always had a soft spot for her after reading biographical accounts of her life and others in the Tudor era. This book did nothing to enhance my love for the time or the people who lived in it. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend Ms. Weir's other works. I even enjoyed her novel Lady Elizabeth much more. This book might be fine if you're already a fan of Alison Weir, but please don't judge the rest of her works by this novel."
5,The star rating says it all,Loved every minute of it. Ranks right up there with all of my favorites! A well-written novel by someone who has always received so much praise for her non-fiction works. I definitely recommend reading this one.
4,"An excellent novel, comparable to Ms. Weir's previous works.","I have long admired Ms. Weir's non-fiction, and was quite interested to explore her first novel. I found it to have the same elegant prose and consistent pacing as her earlier books, though I found it to be lacking in the rich detail and development that exemplify Ms. Weir's works.I enjoyed Ms. Weir's depictions of the relationships between Lady Jane Grey and her Tudor cousins (as most novelists falsely assume them to have been unpleasant). However, I found the characterization of Jane to be somewhat uneven and the beginning of the novel to have highly unrealistic depictions of the cognizance of young child, even a precocious one. The constantly revolving point of view displayed a weakness in the narrative, and detracted slightly from the continuity.I look forward to reading Ms. Weir's next work, either fiction or non-fiction."
2,Innocent Traitor: A novel of Lady Jane Grey,"Very slow moving, does not keep me interested. I like books that make me keep reading when I should stop and do other things.This book is rather boring."
3,"Decent fiction, good history","I like this focus on Lady Jane Grey, though Alison Weir is better as a non-fiction history writer than as a novelist. A bit slow at times, but this is a good read for fans of the period."
3,Got bored...,"Before getting this book, I read Lady Elizabeth and loved it! I then wanted another book of Weir's, so decided to try this one. It starts out okay, but jumps around a lot and left me feeling like something was missing. Somewhere in the middle of the story (and already knowing how it ends), I got bored with the whole thing and put it down. Unfortunately I haven't gotten the heart to finish it yet, but may plow through it at some point. I would definitely recommend reading Lady Elizabeth, but I felt that this book was a waste of time."
3,Just OK,"I found this tedious to get through at some points. Could have made it far more interesting, as it is such an important part of history. Very drawn out, unfortunately."
3,Not the Lady Jane I Remember,"I was so excited to read this book after seeing the movie Lady Jane several years ago. I know movies tend to take some license in the accuracy of their portrayal, but the Jane of this novel seemed so different from the film I saw. In the novel Jane seems severe almost to the point of being a character the reader is unable to sympathize with and Weir seems to make pending death an almost oppressive theme of the novel. While it's already clear to me how the story ends it would be gratifying to see some sense of redemption for the historical figures along the way. Instead, they seem doggedly wrapped up in pending tragedy and constantly angry with the actions of one another. I think a more rounded portrayal of Lady Jane Grey was possible but missing here."
3,Same old story.,"I found that this book didn't really add anymore insight to the story of Lady Jane Grey than did the movie made in the 1980s called ""Lady Jane"". The author does capture well the different personalities of the people involved. Although, most of it is rather stereotypical. I think what it does do well is represent Lady Jane in such a way that one really does feel for her. One is left mystified as to why her parents were so rough on the poor girl. All things which do seem to be historically accurate. I read it while on vacation at the beach one time and truthfully had I not had that much free time, I probably wouldn't have bothered to finish it."
4,Inocent Traitor; A Novel of Lady Jane Grey,"This was a really good book. I enjoyed it a lot. As I was born in England in Leicestershire close to Bradgate Park where she was born, so she has always interested me. It was such a shame how men treated women then & she was really betrayed by her Father who is supposed to take care of their children.I like the way it was written by each individual. Gives one a sense of what they were feeling at that time.Alison Weir did such a great job of combining fact with fiction. I have her novel about the young Elizabeth & am anxious to get started.I would recommend this novel to all historical readers."
4,Another excellent Alison Weir novel,Weirs extensive research of the history of the time of Lady Jane Grey helps her weave a story with depth and convincing details. I thoroghly enjoyed reading this novel as each of Alison Weirs tales adds to my facination with the royals of Tudor times.
3,Nothing Special,"While it was refreshing to know that I could count on most of the book being historically accurate, I'd rather read some historical nonsense by Philippa Gregory any day. It was a little ambitious to have the story told by I don't know how many narrators. And I thought her portrayal of Jane was a little contradictory. At times she seemed meek and submissive- after all, she let those around her push her onto the throne- but at the same time it was said that she was too bold and outspoken. Still, I have to say that the last bit of the book almost had me in tears."
4,History as seen by the eye of the beholder,"This book is unique in both structure and content . The structure is numerous point of view sections that look at the same happening from multiple perspectives, aAlmost like movie cameras taking different shots. The content is historical but the author has attempted to describe both the motivations and inner turmoil of the participants.Interestingly, sections that seem most unlikely are documented as being true, which only proves that truth is stranger than fiction.The only negative from my perspective is that the book is too detailed, with too many thoughts and explanations. At times I wanted to scream ""get on with it"" but I'm glad I didn't follow my first inclination to put it down after just a few chapters for I found the book to be an emotional and satisfying read."
3,Interesting Subject,"As someone who has been fascinated by Lady Jane Grey every since I heard her tragic story in middle school history class, I was happy to discover this novel by historian Alison Weir. While the overall plot and storyline is interesting and pretty good, the mulitiple narrators are a bit too much. While having mulitiple povs can work, there are just too many here. Also, the change of heart at the end by Jane's mother is a little too much for this reader to swallow. By all accounts, she truly was as bad as Weir protrays her in the novel, and there is even some evidence to suggest she was romping around with her much younger lover while her oldest daughter was being executed. Also, she and her two younger daughters did live at court after Jane's execution which suggests she wasn't that broken up about it. Still, it is a good first effort, and anyone who is interested in more Tudor fiction should check out Weir's much better-written second novel, The Lady Elizabeth."
5,One NOT to miss,I have read mostly all of Allison Weir's books on the Tudors. This was an outstanding read. I had no idea what that poor girl had to go through and why her mother was not punished for being so cruel. I recommend it very highly.
3,"Good historically, but poor fiction","I don't usually read historical fiction, but the name. Alison Weir, caught my fancy because I had read Elinor of Aquitaine and loved it. As a novel, this book is unsuccessful. Ms. Weir puts adult words and thoughts into the mouth of a four year old girl. Her style remains non-fiction, with changes of tense and POV, not very convincing as fiction, but nevertheless interesting because she is such an authority on this period.The characters remain cardboard and two dimensional because they don't espress themselves as real people. Use of third person would have been much more succesful and would have allowed Ms. Weir to ""tell"" a story."
2,Bland,"The historical elements to the novel give it all its interest. The story moves along all right, but the main character doesn't seem to have much character in a way. She is a bland sort of girl, who is somewhat priggish, and not in control of events. The author tries hard, but the novel is bland. The innocent does in fact at one point agree to the treason (so it is not entirely against her will, she feels she must try for Queen for the sake of her faith) and while death seems an apalling result for her living her convictions and doing the best she can you feel she is more a victim of her parents and husband than of her cousin."
2,This film is stupid,When I saw this movie the third time I now think this movie is one of the stupidest westerns I've seen.
1,Books of the Bible Missing?,"I was extremely disappointed with this bible. It did not contain the WHOLE Bible; for example the Book of Leviticus (table of content) stated ""only relevant chapters"". My 9 year old niece is studying the Book of Matthew and chapters are missing from that too! I also purchased the GOD Girl Bible for my 13 year old niece and the table of contexts are complete. The font of the bible is great for this young lady. I would like to suggest, that one read the ""five star"" comments and the ""one star"" comments."
4,Dat by Day Kid's Bible,"I purchased two of these- one for my nephew and one for my son. They are 6 and 7 and have both just began reading in the past year. My son really enjoys reading his Bible with me and I've had compliments from tons of people at church- including his Sunday School teachers- who want to buy them for their own kiddos. Although there are not specific numbered verses in this Bible, my son read along with the Pastor during yesterday's service and was able to follow the same story line in 2 Corinthians."
4,My daughter likes it.,"I expected more illustrations and the stories could flow better, they really just rearranged the bible and simplified the language. Still the stories are easy to understand and my daughter seems to enjoy them."
5,Wonderful format,I love this format for helping my children read through the bible. My 9 year old and I read it together each morning before school. She reads it by herself on the weekend. I love that the bible is broken into 365 seven minute readings.
2,Should 7 year olds have to read about Sex?,"I was wondering what the reasoning was for changing the wording in the 10 commandments or again in Romans 3 (day Nov 14) to ""Have sex only with your wife or husband.""We gave this to our newly 7 year old daughter who read the 10 commandments the way you wrote them and immediately asked us, ""What is sex?"" THe fact that she is not aware of this yet is because we keep her from movies, tv shows, and inappropriate subjects...why would publishers of a children's Bible think that this is OK? Outside of our Christian Bubble,folks seem to have a better idea of what is and what is not appropriate for kids. While I went through my master's degree program in education, we never were taught to ""include stories about not having sex outside of marriage in your 1st grade circle time.""This has made me so sad that your Bible has exposed her to this. The secular world seems to have a better grasp of what's appropriate for young minds then the Christian world does at times."
1,Not a great Bible,I bought this Bible from a recommendation and I was very disappointed. There is a reason why the Lord had the Word written the way it is and this is not in correct order at all. Various books and verses are combined and I had to explain to my children why it was incorrect. If you are looking for accuracy I strongly urge you to find a new version for your child.
4,Really great for kids,"We got this for our son when he was 3 (he's 4 now). He can follow along really well. It's definately written with kids in mind. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes it over simplifies it. Ex. instead of the Ark of the Covenant, it's ark box, the 10 commandments are 10 rules, tabernacle is worship tent. I think it would be less confusing when they get older if they just called it by it's name. Other than that, we really like it."
5,well written,"We have used a lot of different materials to do family devotion time with our kids, and this Bible is superb. My husband has a master's of divinity, so he is pretty critical of many paraphrased Bible materials, but he really likes this one. The author has remained very close to the original Biblical language, while using simple words and short sentences that kids understand. As my 5 year old often says at the end of a reading, ""Great story!"""
4,Father Daughter Time,"I read this with my 5-year old daughter each night before she goes to sleep. It is a good time of sharing, learning, and bonding. It is perfect for her age or a few years older or younger and is a great conversation spark."
5,"Review of Heifetz Showpieces, RCA Victor Red Seal",This is a CD for those who really love the violin. The music is for those who want to be stunned and transfixed by an unmatched virtuosic fluency and sweet ethereal beauty. Sarasate's Sigeunerwiesen is so powerful: the slow movement brought tears to my eyes: such was the emotional content and tender sense enthusing this. The other pieces on the CD are no less remarkable in exquisite quality and accuracy.
5,Easily the most popular of Heifetz Albums,"A set of sure audience grabbers. The pieces on this album are popular choices to showcase Heifetz's great technique and talent. The remarkable finger-work, haunting lyrical style of the Spanish/gypsy genre, and the fireworks of the fast pieces are sure to please the music lover of all ages."
1,very poor recording,Besides having to turn up the volume to the max just so I could hear the music. The background is full hiss and stratches
2,my favorite violinist,"For Jasha Heifetz,He is always my favorite violinist.His state of the art in violin play makes listener deep inspire.Especially Zigeuneweissen of Plabo de Sarasate."
4,Looks good,"Has a nice weight and looks good. The face is almost purple. I'm a big guy (270, 5'10) and the band fits perfectly..not too long or short. The case isn't too large, but my next watch will have a bigger face on it. This is a great deal for under $50."
1,This movie doesn't even deserve one star!!!,"Animation has really deteriorated. The King and I is just another example of how the 'magic' of animation has been lost, no help to anyone in the Disney Company. Animation movies such as Lady and the Tramp are better than movies today!! According to the animation rules of detail, color, and overall dialogue. All I can say is, The King and I wasn't even worth making."
1,Terrible Film. Don't waste your money.,This was a dreadful film and I wouldn't consider buying it. Why does it have an average rating of five stars when two of the three previous reviews agreed it was awful?
3,A cute movie,I loved this animated romance and fantasy. I don't usually watch musicals but I love cartoons.
4,"Animation good, story rushed","Warner Brothers could do better. I wasn't expecting the same quality of Disney, but with the name of WB, they should be able to meet certain standards. The whole thing would have been better if the storyline had been better developed."
2,What happened to the 1970's Yul Brynner TV Series???????,"Yes, of course, it is a nice idea to make a cartoon in order to make kids watch a well-known musical. The cartoon certainly had some nice attempts, but if you have to change so much of the original Musical story (not to speak of the actual books by Anna Leonowens!!) why not simply wait until your kids are old enough to watch ""the real thing"". The first impression of something you watch is very important, and I certainly would not want my kids to have this cartoon as their lasting impression of a very lovely musical. If you want to bring the subject closer to kids, why not show them the wonderful 1970's TV series starring Yul Brynner and Samantha Eggar (regretfully not available on video!!)?"
1,It was completly Different than the movie.,"If a child is seeing THE KING AND I for the first time, they will get a completly different feeling about what it was like. I played as Lady Thiang in the stage play, and I feel that she was thrown out of the whole show. They didn't even have her song. Lun Tha wasn't even in the movie and Princess Tuptim was in love with a completly different man. That is not right. The Kralahome was evil. He was supposed to have the role like Lady Thiang, not evil. At the end of the movie, the King didn't do what he was supposed to, and then the prince was supposed to become king. They had props that didn't even exsit then, and made it more fairy tale like then it should have been. If you make a movie that was taken from a very famous movie like this was, you should make it more like the movie. They also cut out some very good scenes that should have been in it. I relise that they have to make it understandable for young children, but it was really much to different."
3,"Not Disney, but Not Bad","An entertaining remake with some good animation, but the story shows the signs of old age. Don't expect kids to sit through the whole movie."
1,Awful monitor,"After much research, I purchased this monitor. I made the mistake of not thoroughly researching the differences between types of LCD displays. The most color accurate displays are S-IPS followed by S-PVA. The worse are type TN, which will only ever give you just 6-bit color--262,144 colors. Various blending tricks are done to create the illusion that there are more colors, but fidelity is necessarily compromised.The HP w2007 is a TN monitor and it shows. The colors were washed out and varied widely across the screen. As could be expected from a TN monitor, all the adjustments I made never got the color fidelity to be more than bad. If that wasn't bad enough, you cannot balance both the darks and the lights. For pure game playing, this monitor might be acceptable (though even there, I didn't particularly like it) but is dreadful otherwise."
1,Never even got to plug it in!,"After all the positive reviews, I decided I couldn't go wrong with this monitor. Unfortunately I never got past trying to move the neck on the monitor so that I could slide it into the stand. It wouldn't move! The instructions were very clear but it was stuck solid. I tried forcing it until I felt it could break off. I looked for a button, or a switch - something to allow the neck to swing up. Nada! I even emailed HP customer service and they admitted that I should return it. I don't know if I want to try again."
4,Nice Monitor,"I replaced a years old 17"" CRT with this one. I tried a 19"" wide screen first, but had to return it as it looked smaller than the old one, due to the wide screen. This one is very nice, very bright, great graphics and color. I play a lot of computer games so it works very well for that.I gave it only 4 stars because of the overbearing software, which would not let me default to a resolution that I could read. It insisted on a default to the recommended, highest resolution, whick I then had to reset lower, due to the visual limitations of 63 y/o eyes.Simply uninstalling the software fixed this problem.I'd recommend this monitor, though it's possible I paid more just for the brand name, than I needed to, to get this size."
4,Excellent Choice,"I bought two of these 20"" HP Monitors for my video editing suite. They are used in the ""span"" mode to double my desktop space. These are really nice monitors and have a lot of ""punch"" (i.e. high contrast), but seem to avoid the ""eye fatigue"" factor that can result from boosting contrast. If I were to buy again, I'd be tempted to upgrade a notch to the 2207 because that monitor has more positioning flexibility and usb outputs.Overall I'm giving it 4 stars, which for me means as good as it gets without causing me to drool. :)"
5,Eye Candy....,"I was looking for a 22"" monitor..A couple of my friends had A samsung and a dell..Another friend had an HP laptop with a 17"" screen and it always looked more colorful than any regular pc monitor I had ever seen.I said,why don't they make a bigger screen for pc's..Well I was out at office depot looking at monitors..I was there for an ink cartrige and I saw this one.I was in complete awe..It made the other 22"" screens look terrible..It was so bright and vibrant..It does also look incredible turned off,It looks like a plasma.The gloss black frame even matches my 56"" samsung tv.Never thought I would own anything HP..I give them alot of credit..The nicest monitor I have ever seen,hands down..My friends are jealous..My brother saw it and bought one..My games or anything else look fabulous..I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,A must buy!!!!!,"This monitor is crystal clear and very sharp. Make sure you have an adequate video card that supports 1680X1050 resolution. Computer games, Internet, and application use are improved immensely when using this monitor. The font will be smaller, but you can adjust it. Otherwise your desktop space is increased and you're immersed in computer games. Before purchasing this monitor I did a lot of research. [...] rated it as one of the best monitors for 2007. They were right. My only qualm is that movies are a little dark. Of course, adjusting the contrast can fix this. Otherwise this monitor is easily worth the $[...] I paid. Granted, I've had it for about a month so the issue of its longevity is inconclusive. I've encountered no problems since purchasing it in middle of Jan.'08. If a problem arises, I will post it here. Easily, this is a must buy monitor if you're looking for something around 20 inches."
5,"HP W2007 20"" Widescreen Flat Panel LCD Monitor","I have had this monitor for about 5 months now and i can honestly say that this monitor has great color and clearity. I really don't think i could go back to a crt monitar after having this monitor for so long. HP Has really turn around there overall program and are startig to compete with other well known brand company's. I highly recommend this monitor if you have the space for it, it is wide and does take up some room but not as much as you would think."
4,Love it except one thing,"The resolution is fantastic. At first, I didn't like the design when I saw it in the store (I thought it was kinda 80s looking). But I now see it as sleek. I was afraid the size was too big but I'm happy with the ability to see across my spreadsheets and it doesn't feel ""in my face"" big. My one complaint is regarding the built-in speakers. They are not loud enough - I have to keep it at the highest setting and I often can't hear - it's very faint sound. If you want to watch movies or if you often click on Internet video clips, you will need additional speakers (hopefully, this was not a purposeful design to get you to buy HP speakers - BTW, the basic ones are quite good - but it's unfortunately, highly possible). Overall - thumbs up!"
2,Wrong monitor,"Not recommended at all. The monitor provides wonderfully vivid color and crisp text when the screen resolution is set to 1680 x 1050. Any other resolution settings would blur the text and smear the color. The monitor automatically adjusts its settings and warns me that ""1680 x 1050 is the recommended setting"" everytime I change the screen resolution. I would say 1680 x 1050 setting for 20 inch monitor gives me a bit too small icons and texts that tire my eyes fast. My video card is generic nVidia but I don't think that matters.I never had these problems with Dell monitors for examples. I am very disatified and thinking of returning it for refund."
4,Beware of HP's software package,The monitor itself is great. Installation is more of a pain. When the HP software/driver package installed it messed up the video driver for the systems integrated graphics. HP was called and had no clue as to what the problem was. Reinstalled the video drivers and everything is OK.
5,great monitor,this is such a great monitor. i use it for graphics and an audio studio. the monitor has near-zero latency and the adjustability of contrast is nice. Not too bright and it is very color accurate for an LCD. Also has the optimum resolution for my application. The 1907 would not support the amount of workspace i needed.Even better was that Amazon got this to me NEXT DAY. I was amazed.My only complaint was that i could not get the DVI to work with my G5 Mac. I am now using the DVI-VGA adapter and it works fine. I really would like to see the DVI difference though.
5,YES!!,"this is so beautiful, as i type, i am using this monitor and it is so crisp and bright and full.....if you are looking for this size monitor and are still pondering, buy it.....it is GREAT"
5,A millestone of Bach playing,"There are very few recordings in which an artist penetrates so profoundly in the soul of a composer. In this recording, Bach's melancholy, serenity and energy come back full of strength right back from the eighteenth century.In Bach's solo playing, I think only Casal's Cello sonatas come close to the divinity of Heifetz's."
3,great musician and composer but a bad match,"Many consider Heifetz to be the twentieth century's best violinist just as they do Pablo Casals the best cellist. However, both were best at romantic music, which their Bach recordings reflect. While not playing Bach the same way he did Brahms, Heifetz liked to soup up Baroque music with lots of vibrato, slides up to the next note and violent double-stops. While some might like this style - which was especially popular before performance practice became widespread - I would much rather hear someone at least attempt to play the piece the way Bach intended. Not to take anything away from Heifetz, but if you want to hear him play his best check out his romantic concertos, not this."
3,Heifetz Everlasting Virtuosity,"As everyone knows, Heifetz is one of the greatest violinists ever, possibly the ""best."" However, in this recording I have noticed he does not follow the ""rules."" In the time Bach lived until the middle aged Beethoven, trills started from the upper note. Heifetz does not follow this rule. The rest of the recording is wonderful with his varying ideas."
2,Bach an Heifitz are opposites...,"I have listened to many Bach recordings and many Heifitz recordings, but very few with the two combined. I'm not really a Heifitz fan, and this recording really puts it into perspective. Heifitz, like always, is techinicaly brilliant, but interprets Bach like he does Saint-Saen. To some degree, he sounds like a robot. The same, fast oscillating vibrato and mechanical bowing arm. If you want a Bach recording with much more sentivity towards the music, and robust playing, try a Menuhin recording or something."
2,It doesn't work.,Heifetz is the supreme violinist of the 20th century. He was without a peer in his class when it comes to Romantic pieces. These sonatas and partitas are not quite right for him. His approach was not of the usual high standard that he set in his other recordings.
3,A good book for a rainy afternoon,"I found it easy to read, enjoyable, and thought-provoking. A nice blending of suspense and action, with recurring themes of forgiveness and understanding. Suitable for older and younger readers alike. I would recommend it to teens. A good book for a rainy afternoon."
3,Enzyte is ok but...,"I saw lots of ads and now I see free offers and money back guarantee.If you expect it to work right away than this is not for you. I recommend get the perscrition pills instead.You have to take it once everyday. It takes about week before you see any effects. It claims that you will notice optimal perfermace after you take it 3 months of daily use. I haven't take it 3 months yet so I can not say if that is true or not.I noticed it does improve my performance little bit. I will say it improve me by 50%. I wish it was 100% though.Is it worth getting it? Well, that's really up to you. Since I do noticed an improvement, I will continue using it.I will still use prescription drugs though. Considering that perscription drugs are expensive, it's good to use Enzyte to save money on perscription drugs. And once in a while use perscription drugs.- Craig C. Chen(I'm using my real name since there's lots of fake user's reviews.)"
5,Casio Silver Tone,"I am impressed. The watch looks terrific. I will recommend this stainless steel beauty to anyone who is looking for a watch of great quality at a bargain price.Thanks Amazon,Charles"
4,Sleek,I really like this watch. It has very classy lines and reminds me of a much more expensive watch.
4,Casio Watch.,"The watch was great! It got to me before valentine day and my boyfriend loved it. What I didn't like was the package not having any paperwork sent with it, no receipt or anything. I also was upset that the watch was ticking when I pulled it out the box. The watch should've been turned off. Also, I didn't get any additional links w/ the watch. Other then all that, I give 2 thumbs up!"
5,Great songs from great men,"I've had the privilege to see these men perform ""in the round"" in Nashville, TN about 7-8 years ago, before the lead singer passed away. I was so inspired by their harmonizations and uplifting songs, that I have purchased all of their music in one form or another.Nothing like the pure human voice with no instruments to take you away to another place."
5,Love them,This is my first pair of Sperrys. They are extremely comfortable and cute. I've received quite a few compliments on them.
5,Leopard sperrys!,These are so cute. My daughter is so in love with them. Wears them almost everyday. They match almost anything.
5,Sperry Bluefish,Very comfortable shoe! I can't believe I waited so long to get a pair! Nice alternative to tennis shoes when you just don't want to wear flip flops.
4,Very comfortable shoe but easy to stain,When I received they had a bit of a scuffed finish in a couple of places but I was able to rub most of it out. I wore them without socks and they were very comfortable. This says a lot coming from a primarily running shoe wearer. I accidentally spilled a drop of soup on them the first time I wore them and they immediately stained but I was able to get most of it out just cleaning with water. I have since ordered saddle soap to clean them with but haven't tried it yet. I have the linen oat color. I love them now but I think I will love them even more in the spring and summer. I haven't worn loafers since high school but I'm enjoying these so far!
1,disappointing,"I purchased the shoes for my mother and when they arrived the right and left shoe weren't exactly the same color nor were they the size I specifically ordered. The company did take them back, but I declined to try again."
5,Buy these shoes today!,"I purchased these Sperry Bluefish 2 Eyes several months ago to wear to my job as a restaurant manager. I'm on my feet for 8-10 hours a day, six days a week and these shoes are comfortable and high-quality enough to withstand the stress I put on them. I can't say enough good things about them - they're flattering to your feet and go with almost anything. They slip right on your feet, too, which makes wearing them even easier than sneakers. Although I initially intended to wear these only for work, I find myself choosing them for weekend activities, as well. I own a couple of different pairs of Sperrys, and these are hand down my favorite. Do yourself a favor and buy these right now - you won't be sorry you did!"
1,Wrong Color Shown,"I selected a pair that was navy blue and had cute light blue plaid, the pair that I received was a different style shown and had an ugly red plaid that was not what I wanted, if you want to buy these shoes be open for receiving a different pair, because you will not get the pair that you wanted. After getting the wrong pair I tried to re add them to my cart to see what would happen and once they were added to the cart the picture changed from the ones that I wanted to the ones that I got. This was awful customer service, if you buy these double check that they do not change in your cart."
5,sperry boat shoe,"great looking shoe with a comfortable fit. Versatile since it can be worn with shorts, jeans or a casual skirt. Love them!"
5,My Go-To Summer Shoe,This has been my go-to shoe all summer long. After foot surgery I cannot wear shoe's without some arch support or padding on the inside. This shoe has both. And I can wear a short sock or foot ped easily with this shoe. I took my usual size in the grey suede leopard.
5,Sperry Shoes,My daughter loved them! Came just in time. Would order again. Happy with service. Tried size on in store to make they would fit correctly.
5,Sperry Billfish,"I loved these shoes! They were absolutely what I was looking for... and much cheaper than anywhere else!! And they got here so fast, in like 3 or 4 days! I am really impressed!!"
2,Decent,"The shoes are fine BUT they are not the color of the picture. The shoes are not brown in color, they are the off-white looking ones. I dont know if the picture is of the wrong shoes or if the company just messed up my order. I bought the shoes for my little sister's birthday, thankfully she liked the off-white color better. That is why I only gave two stars, because I did not get what I thought I was ordering."
4,I WANT More. Great shoes!,"I have a very full closet of shoes. These are one of the best! They are very attractive. They are comfortable. I was thinking they would have a little more padding for the foot and that they may not need socks. They have a little less padding than i like and socks do have to be worn with them. They run big, so get a size down.Would definitely recommend. Gorgeous high quality shoes."
4,cute and classic,I love that I can wear these to work and on weekends and in the summer with shorts. So versatile! I chose the zebra so I could wear them with black outfits and brown outfits- perfect.
2,"Beware Inaccurate Color ""Linen Oat"" Shown on Web Photo","For anyone considering the Topsider color listed as ""Linen Oat"", please be aware that there is no such color and if ordered, you will receive a pair which are exactly as shown for the color ""Linen/Oat"". The web page for this shoe lists these are two (2) separate color options (although very similar in name) and with different photos show for each, BUT after receiving the wrong color twice, I contacted the Vendor & Amazon who confirmed that they are the same color and the ""darker"" tan photos are just wrong. I am trying to get Amazon to fix this by eliminating the inaccurate option and darker color shown, but who knows if that will actually ever get done.Meanwhile, to anyone that may read this....DON'T ORDER ""LINEN OAT"" unless you want a light flesh tan color shoe."
4,Great product/LINEN ROSE PLAID SEQUINS,"This is a great pair of shoes. Each toe did have a tiny scuff mark on the very top. They were a gift. We decided to keep them. Other than that, these shoes were perfect."
1,Two different colored shoes!!,"They sent me two shoes if opposite color! Very frustrating, and they wouldn't let me exchange them. I wasted 60+ dollars on shoes that Wernt even wearable."
5,Well worth the money,"I lOVE these shoes; they are well worth my money spent!!!! Although these shoes are expensive, they are very comfortable and they last a long time. I invested in these Sperrys as work shoes, for my catering job. I needed comfortable black shoes that I am able to stand ffor more than 5+ hours,without my feet hurting. In addition,I know these shoes will last me a couple of years because I still own my brown Sperrys from three years ago and they are in good condition."
4,Pretty Great,"I have been wanting sperries for too long now. I finally went ahead and found the perfect ones and I love them!! The bottom of the shoe seems to be peeling off a little bit. I'm not sure if it was because of who I bought it from or if that's what the shoe does in general. However, I know many friends with Sperries and they've never complained! I still love them and wear them all the time. It took seconds to mold to my feet and feel perfectly comfortable. I love them!"
1,Too Blue for a Shoe,"I ordered these for my daughter, and had to return them. They are very nice shoes, but the color was just too blue."
4,good CD,This CD is a compliation of some of the best and biggest love songs of our time. The good part is that they are all on one Cd. Great CD for creating the mood.
4,Dam good,"This is a great three DVD set covering the history of the British bombing of German dams during World War Two. Before watching these DVDs, I would recommend watching the single ""Dam Busters"" British DVD by Richard Todd, which is a dramatization of the dam busting preparation and raids:The Dam Busters"
4,Not bad at all,I got my easy shaper and it does give you an easy workout. Not to streneous on the mustles. You just have to be consistant to see results.
5,Excellent fiction-believable,"I bought this book, knowing it was fiction, and the story would be someone's opinion. Well, I was elated when I finished the book. I read it in under 2 hours and could not put it down. Although the story is fiction, it is easy to imagine Jabez's life as the author describes. It's a wonderful story and gives you hope that good can come from bad. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction set in biblical times. It's well worth the time to read."
1,Lots of missing plot and character development,"Though little is known of Jabez, and much of the book is speculation and fiction, there is little to convince me that Jabez became a true follower of Yahweh. He suddenly makes his famous prayer to Yahweh without seeming to understand the faith or why he should pray. Very weak book."
4,Jabez,This novel made the Bible character of Jabez come to life. Jabez means pain. This is his life story. The narrative style pulls you into his life from page one and it is hard to put down until you have finished.
4,Great for beginners,I found this book helpful in writing fantasy. I did sense that the book focused more on science fiction and the various ways to write sci-fi. Card has a concise and direct way of writing. The reader has a clear picture of what Card is conveying.
4,A very good read,"Orson Scott Card tackles many sides of writing, and not just of Science Fiction or Fantasy. He is an admirable writer, both of fiction and writing books. You can read this book with half a mind, and get ideas which will soon devellop into stories, or you can read it with all your attention, and learn more of the craft of writing. A very good buy. I really enjoyed reading it several times."
3,How to Write Science Fiction & Fantasy,"If you've never written Sci-fi and DON'T know the market it's 5 star, even though its print date is a little old. It's a start. I'm not all the way through the book and so far most of what's discussed I already knew--through my own research."
2,Very Generic,"Though, it had some good advice for beginning writers, I felt that it didn't delve deep enough into writing science fiction & fanasty. It didn't contain any advice that I couldn't find online for free."
2,"Directed mostly at science fiction writers, not fantasy writers","The title of this book should omit the ""& Fantasy"" part. It seems to me that the book was originally aimed at science fiction writers, but the writer thought the audience can be broadened by adding fantasy writers. I like fantasy and I want to write fantasy, but I am not particularly interested in science fiction. The reason I bought the book is because I thought it was going to have a reasonable treatment of how to write FANTASY, and in what I have read so far (and what I have browsed in advance) that topic is covered so little that the book should not be directed at aspiring fantasy writers at all. If you are an aspiring science fiction writer you may like the book, otherwise probably you will feel cheated."
2,"SF, YES... F, NO","If you are trying to write about science fiction, this is an average book. I am an aspiring fantasy writer and was duped by the title. The meager fantasy entries do not constitute adding the word ""Fantasy"" to the cover. I also got a bit annoyed with the flow of ideas; every line is based on how the author came up with ideas and each suggestion stemmed directly from something he had wrote. The book read more like a promotional book than a How-To. I was left more stifled than inspired. To this date, the best book on writing I have ever read is ""If You Can Talk, You Can Write"" (Joel Saltzman) and I recommend it for all genres of aspiring writers."
3,"Good, solid advice","I liked much that this book had to offer for the beginning writer of speculative fiction. I appreciated the sections on building worlds and on writing well. I also gained a lot of practical advice in the last section, about the ""nuts and bolts"" of being a writer. However, there were times that my mind drifted while reading. The book also leaned towards science fiction and, since I prefer writing fantasy, I found myself longing for more specific info in that arena. All in all, this was a very solid choice in beginning my journey as a fiction writer. I gleaned nuggets that I can use right now in preparations. However, the book was not earth-shattering or life-changing. A good but not great resource."
3,It' okay,"This is a good book for a high school level or above who want to get into the ""mainstream"" sci-fi writing scene. Card doesn't delve much into the fantasy genre because, as he states clearly in the first few pages, he's mainly a sci-fi writer. It contains a few tips and tricks that will be useful. However, it's a bit outdated in some of the views (it was written almost 15 years ago) and the genres have changed a bit, especially with the advent of Harry Potter. But again, it's allright IF your just starting to get interested in writing."
3,Second Best,"Though it won a Hugo, a lot of the information that Orson Scott Card provides offered in even the smallest of writing courses. The one stand-out in this book is Chapter 2: World Creation, as it details great ways of creating that fictional world for your characters roam. Not the best, though. Worlds of Wonder by David Gerrold is much better."
4,Usefull,A helpful book for writing Science Fiction. Good ideas and suggestions. Clearly outlined and written. A must if you are starting to write.
4,Science Fiction & fantasy,"The small font of text makes the book difficult to read, a kindle version would be nice, especially for those of us who have had a few life experiences. Yet, the book itself is an invaluable resource, countless tips on how to write fantasy and fiction. For example, the author provides the audience with tools to create a world, rules that will allow you to create your art. As a result, you will be able to construct your story-main character, protagonist, and view point. Finally, the author give an overview of a writer's life, he gives you a dose of reality too."
4,Good coverage of the Subject,"When you come down to the nuts and bolts all how to write books present the same or similer information as each other. The only difference is the presentation style of the writer and possibly the empasis of some particular aspects over others.I found this book to be the right book at the right time for me. Some areas like the treatment of reader expectations was new (at least to me). Other points where presented well.A lot of the examples are based on personal expirence, and why shouldn't they be? He is a published author. At the end of the day if he uses his own writing as an example he can known how he developed the ideas, if he uses someone else's he can only speculate.About the only thing to be said against this book is that a lot of the advice on the publishing industry is dated and by now inaccurate, but hay this book was written quite some time ago and the real world is a moving target."
4,A must-read for writers of *any* type if Fiction,"Do you write? Do you write *anything*, even if it's not Science Fiction? This is the best book I've ever read on writing fiction.It thoroughly and masterfully discusses the mechanics such as plot, pacing and characterization. It dispenses insightful advice.But most importantly, it tells you how to polish. How to edit your own work. How to train an 'educated reader' to help you edit your own work.If you are trying to break into the fiction market today, your manuscript has to be good already. Publishers don't have time or resources to help you polish. Card gives intelligent, creative advice on how you and your 'educated reader' can work together to produce the best story you are capable of writing.This book also contains excellent insight on the peculiarities of writing Science Fiction and Fantasy. But no matter what kind of fiction you write, read this book.Terry L. Neil"
5,A long time ago..,"...in a time far away, I was an aspiring fantasy writer, and I picked this book up off the shelf shortly after it was published. I've never forgotten the MICE, and to this day, I still use the basics of that idea to help me focus my stories.If you're an advanced writer, this book may not hold as much as you'd like. But for the beginning/low intermediate writer, this book presents many ideas that helps them get a grip on the mysteries of storytelling, esp. SF&F;."
4,Good for more than one thing,"Even if you are not planning on writing science fiction or fantasy today, this book is worth your time if you are 1) interested in Orson Scott Card and how he gets and develops his ideas, and what he likes to read, or 2) you are interested in writing of any kind, even non-fiction. If you have even a fleeting interest in any of these subjects, Card will tell you more in a little book than almost anyone else in a very big book."
5,Must read for any SF & Fantasy writer,"Orson Scott Card's fiction is incredible, and Ender's Game is one of the classic scifi novels. Card manages to do a very good job of teaching the craft, with a very specific emphasis on speculative fiction. I wasn't expecting it to be this good, and I'm sure it will be a daily go-to reference.Want to write scifi or fantasy? Buy this book, study it."
2,Not worth the time to read,"This book is no different than most of the other ""How to"" books dealing with SF&F. Most of what is written is dealing with SF than Fantasy. If your trying to write Fantasy, you would be better off looking somewhere else."
4,Lots of good but very basic writing advice,"I can only presume that Card sees a lot of really terrible stories at writing workshops. While the advice in this book is great, it's also all very basic, and most of it should be obvious to people who have read a significant amount of fiction. I would recommend this book only for extremely inexperienced authors who haven't yet learned the basics of good writing."
2,"Entertaining, but not helpful","I found the book fun to read, but I must say that in retrospect it is not helpful. Most of it consists of anecdotes about his personal experiences and his personal life... interesting for fans, but not really helpful for the aspiring writer."
3,"Good, but not quite for me...","3 1/2 stars.Pros: This book is a great book for beginners in writing. Very informative, and I especially enjoyed the section about publishing your own books. This is a short paragraph, I know, but it still acounts for three stars.Cons: For more experienced writers (I'm fourteen, and have just experimented a little) Which I'm afrais include myself, this is repetative, and probably a little tedious. I understand where he's comming from, and, frankly, it isn't Card's fault. To write a book, specific only to writing a genre, you can only include basic things, vague, general, things. You can't tell somebody how to write a book becase a. Everybody's unique, and you'd be surpressing creativity on their part, and b. You'd probably be wrong. Some techniques work for some, and some other techniques, work for some other people. I still recommend buying this book, especially since it's now dirt cheap."
2,Trivializes a high art form,"Books like this are almost self-parodying. 'How to Paint a Mona Lisa', 'How to Play Like Yo-Yo Ma', etc. All this book did is show that sci-fi writers are going thru such lean times that they can make more money selling how-to books than doing their 'thing'. Seriously, would a real pro in a crowded market sell his secrets for success for a few bucks, hoping to create his own competition? Not likely. Writing great lit. takes a dedication to art that makes this slim how-to volume seem like an insult, sorry. If he had titled it 'How I Write Sci-Fi/Fantasy"", it might have been more honest; but not really, precisely because he's hiding his 'best secrets' to keep you from topping him. Think for yourself."
3,Mostly a good book.,"The book is informative. I like most of it. However, it does seem to knock a few science fiction genres such as Star Trek. It seems that the author is biased against this. I can understand it. It does not seem that he keeps up with science. He does not like the ""ansible"" when there is some proof that it may be possible. A little closed minded. His books are okay. He seems to be inspired by the book of Mormon in his writing. But a compettemt writer."
2,Better music out there,"I had to add another opinion to all these glowing reviews. There is a chance you won't like Laurie Berkner's music. My mother purchased 2 Laurie Berkner CD's for my kids based on all the 5 star reviews on Amazon. We listened to this CD once as a family. My husband and I just looked at each other and said ""There is no way we can listen to this stuff"". Her lyrics are pithy and unimaginative. We really enjoy some of our other children CD's, like Raffi and Ralph Covert. Berkner's music just was not something we were not willing to add to our music collection."
4,We parted with this with weeping and wailing,"We borrowed this from the library after purchasing the other 3 Laurie Berkner CDs. Unfortunately I took my son with me to the library to return it...he had a total meltdown when we returned it! He begged me to check it out again and cried for 1/2 an hour, until I promised I'd find the CD and buy it.That said, it is my least favorite of the Berkner CDs. I think it is the least polished and most eclectic. My son, however, apparently cannot live without the bluesy Chicken song, the meowing of ""The Cat Came Back"" and, of course, the beloved Dinosaur song. Overall, the songs are a pleasant break from typical kid-fare that make your brain feel as though someone has alternately stuck with an icepick and then poured lemonade in the wound tract. There are also plenty of songs, so you aren't listening for 20 minutes and back at the beginning.This is going to join our other Berkner CDs, Ralph's World and world music classics in my son's CD holder."
4,really catchy contagious tunes,"My daughter loves this CD, but we never get past the first 4-6 songs. #4 (Toot, toot) is her favorite and we listen to it over and over and over and over again. I'm sure everyone will get hooked on the tunes after just one or 2 listening sessions. Boys tend to love the dinosaur song, and as an adult I appreciate the reference to Seinfeld in ""Doodlebugs"""
5,FUN for the entire family!!!!,This CD keeps my daughter smiling and dancing from beginning to end. Thank goodness I found this CD because I was tired of listening to Elmo's Greatest Hits! I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to let loose and dance around the house with your baby/toddler. It's just that much fun and so worth the money.
5,My 2 1/2 year old twins are Laurie Berkner groupies,"My daughter sings ""We are the dinosaurs"" and various other songs from the album (and Berkner's two others). My son can too, but usually lets her do the work. When we're in the car, the usual refrain is ""more Laurie?"" We live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, so we're fortunate enough to be able to see Ms. Berkner, her husband-bass player, Brian and her keyboard player, Susie, live several times a year. The kids are just old enough to join the other kids up front acting out the songs. I think if my kids had to choose between Laurie or Blues Clues, they'd say ""Bye bye Steve."" Get the video too. It's a lot of fun."
4,"Very fun kids album that adults will like, too.","Laurie Berkner doesn't really have a dud (yet) in her catalog. So, if you like her (how can you not?) you will get them all. This CD has some of our favorites - ""We are the Dinosaurs"", ""Doodlebugs"", ""I Know a Chicken"", ""I Have a Rooster"" that are on many of Henry's (age 3) playlists.The musicianship is first-rate, the enthusiasm infectious. Don't be dissuaded by those who will say, ""it's _kids_ music, MY kids don't listen to that."" That's silly -- this is not sappy junk -- it's good simple tunes that kids will love. Buy a guitar and learn to play them and sing along with you kid, they'll love it.Now, don't get me wrong -- a steady diet of this (or anything) will drive you a bit crazy -- so mix it up! A est with ""I Know a Chicken"", followed by Lois Jourdan singing ""Ain't Nobody Here but us Chickens"", then Rufus Thomas's crazy funk/soul ""Old MacDonald"", etc., is the ticket."
5,Whadda I think? I think it's great!,"Laurie Berkner became a household favorite through her Noggin videos, and this album lived up to our expectations. It's silly but not too silly, upbeat but not too crazy, and just plain fun for everyone! Parents will recognize some of the classic songs on here, and others will quickly become new ""classics"" for you and your kids.And side note - there's a video for ""We Are the Dinosaurs"" on Laurie's new DVD ""We Are the Laurie Berkner Band""!"
4,Music for kids that adults can enjoy too,"This CD was one of the first gifts my baby got -- I'd neverlistened to any kid music before except some very irritatingDisney songs when I visited my friends' houses, so I was reallypleasantly surprised. Laurie Berkner has a good voice for kids;it isn't ""plasticky"" and her songs are actually fun to listen to.There's also plenty of variety in the songs and enough songs (22 tracks) to last a trip to the grocery store and back.I haven't heard any of her other cds, so I can't comment on this one relative to the others, but it certainly seems more enjoyable than some of the other kids music I've heard."
5,We love Laurie!!,"You can't go wrong with Laurie Berkner!! My son loves her music and I find it addicting as well. Who can't sing along with ""We are the Dinosaurs??"""
5,Fantastic Product,My three year old cannot get enough Laurie Berkner. She sings the songs day in and out. She wants to go to Laurie's house. She wants to go to Laurie's concerts. Very well arranged stuff w/ good vocals. Good thing too because Mom and Dad have to listen quite a bit too. Harmony is slightly better on the DVD (Also very good)
4,Automotive Service - Gilles,"I've been hoarding auto tech manuals for decades. This is one of the best. Clear writing style. Careful proofreading (so far). Clear and appropriate photographs and diagrams. As expensive as this book is, it paid for itself twice-over in the first two days I had it. YMMV.For older cars and trucks, this book could be supplemented with ""Auto Engines and Electrical Systems"" by Motor Book Company.Bruce SLC,UT"
4,works well for us,"Although the safety strap is a bit difficult to figure out how to tighten, the ""legs"" that go between the mattress and box spring do a fine job of holding it in place even when our 35 lb toddler is wedged up against it. Love that it folds down almost all the way-another inch and it would. This works perfectly and gives about a foot of room of open space at the head and about 18 in by the foot(where the step stool goes) on a full size ""big kid"" bed."
3,Measure your bed (top of boxspring to floor),"20 inches high sounds great, but its too tall (by about 4 inches) to fold flush against the bed - so either we leave it up, or trip on it. You would need a very high box spring for this to work...As rails go, it's a rail. Sturdy enough, long enough to protect most new bed sleepers.But the design is tough..."
