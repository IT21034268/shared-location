3,Confusion,There seems to be some confusion over two similar specials. What is shown/sold is the PBS Victory in the Pacific from the American Experience series and narrated David Ogden Stiers. It does a fine job of covering basically the last year of the war in the Asian Theater. What people are listing as stars is the CBS Special entitled Victory in the Pacific hosted by Dan Rather. This does a fine job of covering the whole war in the Pacific. Does anyone know where I can get the latter?
2,Whoa! Shop Around!,"The Step is the best home stepper on the market. It is the brand used in most gyms and on most step aerobics videos. It has the largest step surface available (approximately 14"" by 40"") and sports a slip-free rubber surface for safety. The steps I've seen for this price all have four plastic platforms so the stepper can raise the step level from 4"" to 6"" to 8"". This step does not have these adjustments, so you will be stuck with a 4"" height. That is fine if you are just starting out but, more than likely, you will eventually want to raise the level to at least 6"". Just the main 4"" platform for this price is way too much. Sporting goods stores sell the 3-level adjustable step with a video for the same price so shop around and you'll get the most benefit from your stepping experience."
5,Tellicherry Peppercorns,I really like the fact that the peppercorns arrived in a airtight bag. When I opened the bag the arroma was wonderful. This is the same type of black pepper you can buy at any grocery store but if you compare price per ounce; this definately is the better choice! Great product. I will be a return customer for these peppercorns in the future.
5,Very tasty,"Not a girly boy pepper like what you find in the grocery store. This has a kick in it and you will taste the pepper. It has been nearly 30 years since I can remember tasting pepper, it all seems so weak now. Not this, brought back memories of what pepper tastes like."
3,Tellicherry Peppercorns thru Amazon,"I was not happy with the delivery time (weeks instead of the days it took to deliver the rest of my order) and not impressed by the packaging ( a flimsy plastic bag that gave off a strong peppery odor.) I ordered electric salt & pepper mills and salt/pepper as a Christmas gift, so I can't comment on taste. I might have ordered from another source had I known in advance of the long lead time on the order. I am concerned that the peppercorns won't retain their flavor in their original packaging."
5,Great!,These peppercorns work great in my pepper mill. I like course ground and these seem to work better than other products I have tried. I will reorder.
4,Pull up a chair & put on your specs,"Ken Druse has ""done it again"" -- a beautiful, useful book that any gardener (amature or master) will want to own. When mine arrived from Amazon, I put down everything and started reading. Everything the other reviewers said is accurate, and so I won't repeat that here.However, there is one thing that no one has mentioned: the type is tiny! Even with my reading glasses -- which I hardly ever have to wear -- I still end up squinting. I think that the stylist for the book made a decision that while elegant is hardly in the best interest of the reader. Given that Mr. Druse is a magazine editor, it is not surprising that the pages are in multiple column layout, but it is suprising with the small type how dense it all seems.This is an excellent reference guide and the copious appendixes are probably the best I have seen in any reference material."
2,Rambling with a Radio Gardener,"I bought this book for some very specific instructions and advice about propagating plants- techniques, supplies, time of year to do it, what techniques for what plants, etc. Instead I got a gorgeous coffee table book with beautiful pictures but a lot of text that makes no sense, and very few instructions. Not clearly written, rambles instead of proceeding logically... what were the editors thinking?"
3,What Might Have Been vs. What Was Actually Worn,"First, yes, it's a uniform book, so any reviewer who says ""too much about uniforms"" needs to find a better crack dealer.Simply put, this fills a niche, but readers should NOT take the uniform plates at face value as the plates show (particularly for the Legion of the United States) what the uniforms WOULD have looked like had the regulations been followed. Example, the Legion light infantry and rifles did NOT wear colored wings. There are several other issues like this throughout the book, so the reader needs to understand that the uniforms depicted are to illustrate what should have been, but not what was actually worn."
2,To much info on uniforms,"This book was a disapointment. Almost all of the book was devoted to uniforms of the period. Little information was given on campaigns fought during the period. It would have been better if more information was given about the US armie's crucial participation in the battles of Tippicanoe, Fallen Timbers, and St. Clairs Defeat( The worst defeat suffured by the US at the hands of Native Americans) instead of how the hats of artillery crewman changed in the course of a few years. The narrative is extremley dull!! I had to force myself to finish the book. However the plates are great and this period of US millitary history is so neglected that any book on the subject welcome."
5,GREAT INTERVIEW,"I had read this book years ago and like so many other things, you lend it out and never get it back. sigh. I was happy to find this online and ordered it straight away. It was ordered at the same time as my Amazon stuff (through a reseller) and it beat my Amazon order by a good 3 days! lolThis is a fantastic inverview. I only wish an audio were available. Maybe someday."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,"There is no other way to describe this book. From the antics of Mr Fixit Fox to Couscous, the Algerian detective, this book is packed with fun from cover to cover! I heartily recommend this book to parents with children with lively imaginations, and to those who wish their children to DEVELOP lively imaginations."
1,Terrible--Stay away from this tape!!!,"I would give this 0 stars if I could...This is an awful tape. There are only a few full performances and the music is dubbed (and not done very well!!!) It is not worth your time or money. If you want great skating tapes and are just starting out, buy ""Magic Memories on Ice"" Volumes 1 through 3. They are great."
2,Skimpy on number of performances shown,"The jacket of the video gives a list of about twelve skaters who are supposed to appear on the video. There were only five or six who's routines were actually shown. Bits and pieces of the other skaters were shown, but never in a full performance. Plus, when the video finally came to a performance, you couldn't count on the entire thing being shown. Sometimes the middle of a performance was cut out. Definitely not worth the money."
3,How much do you love sk8ing?,"As other reviewers have stated, the number of perfomances is few, however, there really aren't many sk8ing video's from the mid-90's to buy. So, if you REALLY enjoy watching sk8ing from during that time period, and don't mind dubbed music and some cut down programs, you'd enjoy this compilation of sorts. If not, don't buy it..."
3,Char's opinion,"I have read several of the Harington books on my Kindle and since I'm from the Ozarks originally was interested to see how he interpreted the area historically, and if he indeed had captured the language idioms and pronunciations the way I remembered them from my childhood. Indeed he did! I liked his style of writing and enjoyed them. Most recently I purchased the Cockroaches of Staymore. It was slightly humoorous but in many ways a disappointment. I don't know exactly what I had expected but was unprepared for what I got. The cockroaches might as well have been people due to their conversations, thought processes etc. so why write a story like that from a ""bug"" perspective? Those of us who have read Harington know that he was an interesting person so perhaps that explains this book. Not a bad read, but not the exceptional one I expected."
4,The Cockroaches of Stay More,Donald Harington's writings about Stay More are always fun and this is no exception.Puckish good humor. I first read The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks and that was what caused me to get The Cockroaches
1,Worst Chair I've Ever Sat in,"This chair is extremely uncomfortable--it tilts too far forward when in a resting position and is difficult to rock. The seat is extremely hard. It was also a pain to put together--the notches in the screws were not the same shape as the allen wrench that came with the chair so it was almost impossible to get them in, and once they were in, and we realized how badly the chair sucked, we couldn't get the chair to come apart for a return. This chair makes the experience of rocking my baby daughter to sleep extremely miserable."
3,Don't buy this chair for comfort,"I bought this to rock my two month old son, and it doesn't suit this purpose. It has you sitting up so straight that you are almost falling forward if you've got a baby in your arms. I hoped to be able to relax, but this chair gives me a core workout."
3,Duets and covers,"This is a nice album for fans of Johnny Thunders more ..well ""sensitive"" side. Its not the destroying riffs most fans know. Its a more subdued but no less potent Thunders, and his voice in contrast to Patti on some tracks is very interesting. The Album's real highlights would have to be Two time loser; a soul filled pleading between the two, Uptown Harlem poppy and upbeat song, born to cry, treat her right and the odd Crawfish. This Cd is Thunders with a full backing band, I do mean full: maracas, violins, castanets, saxophone. I give it a three because while not my favorite by far it's a nice listen ranging from blues to pop tunes. A definitely different listen then the normal Thunders' tunes."

A definitely different listen then the normal Thunders' tunes."
3,A disappointment,"I find that the illustrations, while often filling a page or two, are woefully simplistic and insufficiently detailed. Look like illustrations out of a child's book - not something particularly useful to an adult. For example, the illustration of Herod's temple, while filling two full pages, could have easily been presented on half a page and not have suffered. Found far better illustrations online."
2,Not a very good source of informative maps,"Man, I don't know what it is about so-called Bible Atlases, but they seem to be a dime a dozen. But very few of them offer actually useful maps, and this is not one of them. There are page after page of tangential information, including a breakdown of the many Christian religions and what they each believe (not that I'd trust any one author to get all of that right). But try to find a decent Bible map in this book, and you'll be disappointed. I mean a GOOD map with ACTUAL value relating to the various periods in Biblical history. This book seems to almost be written for a juvenile audience. For serious students of Biblical history, I STRONGLY recommend the ""St. Joseph Atlas Of The Bible"" by Tim Dowley. It is a smaller, less expensive, but incomparably superior collection of maps (79 of them) that are ordered in order of the books of the Bible, so you can actually use the maps as you read through the Bible. This Rose Book is basically useless in that regard."
2,Not recommended for serious Bible students,This book would be best for home-schoolers or pre-teen age. A lot of the pages are full of opinion.It reads more like a surface commentary than a study book. I wouldn't even recommend it for new Christians because it is so full of opinion. Pretty disappointing for the money.
2,the best of sandi patti,"The music and singing was lovely, but I did not appreciate the audience clapping at the end of each song. It would be more soothing and enjoyable if the audience participation was cut out. I actually give this CD away."
5,"Roses Book of Bible Charts, Maps & Time Lines","I absolutely LUV this book! It has So much information in it about the Bible, church history, maps, charts, Noah's Ark, the tabernacle, weights and measures, beliefs of major religions, old & new testament people, end times views, meanings of the names of God the Father and Jesus etc. It's all in full color, easy to understand and read. I whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone who wants a good reference for the bible."
4,Nice resource,Nice but it doesn't have some of the tables that I would have liked. Over all a good referance product.
2,Not what I expected,All though this book does have a lot of information I really was looking forward to a detailed timeline from the beginning to the end of the bible. And unfortunately I don't think that the timeline is very detailed. I've seen free ones on the internet that had more detail. I wanted world history as well as biblical history to compare the two. And there is only one fold out timeline in the beginning of the book.
3,another missed opportunity,"With all the Bible Atlases available, here and abroad, separate and in ""Study Bible"" appendices, why is the location of the ""cities of the plain"" of Genesis 14 & 19 omitted here too? The ruins of Sodom can be visited near the Dead Sea, but mention here is absent. Rose could have improved on others' previous efforts, but instead joined the bunch. And, despite it being ""controversial,"" mention could have been made of the purported discovery of Mount Sinai in Arabia (Galatians 4:25), as there's nothing in the ""Sinai"" peninsula remotely resembling that described in Exodus. We bought this Atlas for a homeschool assignment. We like it, but it lacks the completeness we had expected."
5,Pack with information! More than I expected to get!,"This book was SO much more than I expected to get when I ordered it. It has the timelines and maps as the title and description says but it also lays out the prophesies in a table to show the links between the Old and New Testaments. It has all the names of God and where you can find it in the Scriptures, a summary of each book in the Bible, the descriptions of each group of religious/Christianity/Cults, the branches of the religious denominations, AND SO MUCH MORE! This is a must buy for any Christian or anyone curious. I showed this book to my Bible Study friends and they all want one so I am putting in a group order for 20 books!"
5,Well worth the price!,"The Rose Book of Charts, Maps & Time Lines is an incredibly well organized and presented book of information on the Old & New Testaments, Church History, Comparative Religions/Cults, etc. The book has quickly become one of my most referred to reference works on the Bible. Pastor's, Sunday School teachers, Bible study leaders, students of the Bible, & all followers & would-be-followers of Jesus will find this to be an invaluable tool for studying God's Word. Furthermore, you may make up to 300 copies of each page in the book for use in Bible studies, Sunday School, etc.--without written permission. Also, many of the pages are available in stand alone full-color glossy brochures. The book includes an index as well. I trust you will not be disappointed!"
4,Great Bible Resource,"This book is a great resource for a beginner trying to understand the Bible. It enables a high level understanding of many central themes, the individual books and how this is all linked in the flow of time and history. This book probably does not present enough detail for the advanced student."
5,Excellent resource for Bible study,"This book has easy-to-read charts and diagrams and is great for studying the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. It has a binding that makes it easy to fold back but yet it is contained in a hard cover. Easy to read and much needed to study topics like kings, prophets, etc. Highly recommend this for beginners and advanced alike."
5,Rose does it again,I teach with this resource and have great success with it because of the wide range of information. Another Fantastic resource.
5,"Review of Rose Book of Bible Charts, etc","Of course, it probably helps when I recommend a book that MY NAME is part of the title (Rose ) :) This book is a fabulous resource .. Where has it been hiding? LOVED IT"
3,"Bible Charts, Maps & Time Lines",I bought this book to give to a person whose love interest I was trying to win - - -It didn't serve that purpose.
5,"Rose Book of Bible Charts, Maps, and Time Lines",I facilitate a bible study group in my parish and get constant comments on how great this study aid is.
5,Excellent!,"I have used my Lodge dutch oven a number of times already and everything cooks perfectly. It's practical, easy to clean, looks great, and it's affordable. What more does one need?"
5,Perfect little pot,"I've had this Dutch Oven for about 8 months, use it maybe 3 times weekly. No problems whatsoever. It's a great size, not too heavy, cleans up beautifully (my very expensive Le Creuset stains horribly). I grew up cooking in cast iron and absolutely love the even heat and control you have when using it. Some of my soup recipes have had to be altered to fit this smaller size, but since I'm only usually feeding two, that's ok. I'd buy again."
5,5 stars for customer service from this seller,"It seems like the Lodge product itself is a little hit or miss in terms of quality. My Dutch oven wasn't cracked or chipped, but the lid wasn't level. I was able to return it no problem for a full refund and free shipping."
4,Lodge color enamel dutch oven,"Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. But, I was disappointed that Lodge had this made in China. Their products had previously been made in USA."
4,Nice quality for a reasonable price,"This purchase replaces a LeCruset that was a gift many years ago and got a chip inside from mishandling. I did not want to spend the cost of a brand replacement and having owned Lodge cast iron ware, trusted this company. I am not disappointed. It is sturdily made and looks as though it will provide many years of service.One small quibble, the lip of both the pot and the lid are not coated in any way and the first time I left them on a towel to dry, they rusted and left a mark that does not come out. I'm sure there is a production reason for this but a mention of it would have been nice. I now have it coated with oil but that of course, makes it own stain problems.I use this pan about 2-3 times a month and am very satisfied with its performance. I will be looking at smaller sizes soon. Good company."
5,A Very High Quality Dutch Oven,"I am very pleased with my 6-Quart enameled dutch oven. The white enamel inside is slick and resists sticking very well and does not stain even when cooking paprika-laden Hungarian recipes. It holds and transfers heat just as one would expect from cast iron, so you can use a lower flame. I especially like the new metal knobs on the lids. Now I can use the whole think in a 450 degree oven for baking bread."
5,Handy in the Kitchen!,I got this for my friend as a gift and she loves it! It's really heavy though but cooks superbly.
5,Waited a. Long time for this pan.,I found this enameled cast iron pan on sale. It was on sale so I finally got it. High quality great product.
5,I love Lodge enameled cast-iron!,"The Lodge enameled cast-iron 3-quart Dutch Oven in red was wedding gift for a niece.She and her husband both like to cook. I have the larger size Lodge enameled dutch oven and I love it! So I thought they might like one, too. They were thrilled....all their other cookware is red, so it matches!"
5,gift,"Gave this to my brother with a big family. It is all he talks about, his grandchildren call it ""Pop's Magic Pot"" because there is always something tasty going on it in that pot. He loves it!"
3,MADE IN CHINA -- not for bread baking,We first looked at the LODGE web site before ordering this item and it certainly seemed as though Lodge products were made in a small town in Tennessee (check for yourself at www.LodgeMFG.com ). Turns out this item is Made in China -- very disappointing.The other issue is one mentioned in a previous review -- we needed a larger cast iron dutch oven for baking bread but the knob is unsuited to the temperature needed.Does anyone know of a similar product MADE IN AMERICA ?
1,It rusted at first use!,This pot rusted the first time I used it with a pot roast in the refrigerator. It rusted all along the edge of the lid and pot. I called the manufacturer and they replaced it. The new one rusted when I tested it with water in it for 24 hours. Do not buy this product!!!
3,UGH! Made in China,This is my own fault. I didn't want to pay the big bucks for a LeCreuset so I bought this even though I knew it was made in China. It has great heat distribution and is beautiful but I am worried about the safety of using China made cookware so I will now have to buy the LeCreuset as well as this one because I have doubts about the safety. If you feel comfortable using cookware made in China I would hightly recommend this!
4,Dutch Oven,"Received our order , works great and we arevery happy with it. It was delivered timely andwas in the price range we were looking for."
2,not for cooking with red wine,"I bought this replacement pot for occasional cooking. My previous pot lasted me over 10 years. Yesterday after slow cooking a brisket of beef previously soaked in red wine the enamel got seriously stained. Nowhere in the page of ""instructions"" it said that I can't cook food soaked in wine! Here goes my coq-au-vin! Bleaching it for hours helped to eliminate the dark spots but the bottom of the pan is no longer white but specked and lightly stained. Now I had to waste enormous amount of energy and time to mail the heavy item back and get a replacement since the warranty expired in just one year. Amazon was, of course, very helpful, but just going through the rigamorole of returning such a heavy item: getting a carton box, packing and mailing it was a lot of tedious trouble. I really wish that the manufacturer read such reviews, and implemented some kind of quality control, so the poor sods like me won't get stuck with the inferior product."
3,Lodge enameled Dutch Oven - NOT MADE IN USA,"I got this Dutch oven because I read the review here and somewhere it was said that it was made in the USA, as opposed to all the others made in China except the one from France. I even wrote a letter to Lodge Mfg. to see why they had a limit on the baking degrees, not over 400* I do bread at 475*. I was told that it is the knob that can't go over that, so I could take it off and put aluminum foil in the hole - not sure how I was suppose to get the lid off. Anyway I thanked them for making this in the USA - did not correct me but when I got the box it says big a life, MADE IN CHINA - in three languages. So much for believing what you read. It look good, have not used it yet. Not sure I want to risk the possibility of lead poisoning."
1,Cheap Knob,The Plastic knob on this oven can not be heated to more than 400 degrees ??? Oh you can put it in the oven just don't make it to hot!!! Suck it lodge
3,Lodge 6 Qt Dutch Oven,"Lodge Color 6-Quart Dutch Oven, Island Spice RedI purchased this Dutch Oven from Amazon on 4/10/2011. It is a large cooking vessel and I have only used it a few times. Yesterday I used it to prepare a stew and while cleaning it after browning the chicken I noticed that the interior enamel is already wearing off revealing the underlying iron base.It seems to me that after only a few uses over only a nine month period this is not right. This should be replaced."
2,Not good for a long run,"I purchased the 6q enamel dutch oven in early 2010. At the beginning it was working great.I used it for browning meat, making stews and soups.Then I started baking bread in it. I would heat it up to 450 - 475F. My bread was coming out way better than when baked just on the stone.However, shortly after I noticed a lot of bubbles on the bottom of the pot. Later I decided to clean it by boiling some water with baking soda. That caused a lot of the enamel to just chip off, crack even more and now the whole bottom looks horrible.I don't know if I can even use it for browning meat or any frying any more.I'm very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend it for people who want to use it for more than making stews and soups."
2,Looks great but not built to last,"Looks fantastic and works fine for a couple months then the interior enamel flaked off. I always hand washed it and never over heated it. Since I don't want to risk chipping a tooth the entire thing has been thrown into the trash. What a waste. I expected more from Lodge. While many of the Lodge products are made in the USA, these enameled Dutch ovens are made in China."
1,Not what I expected from Lodge,"I purchased this dutch oven for my daughter for Mother's Day in 2008. Within only a few months, the beautiful finish started to discolor, apparently from heat. Approximately 2 months ago, the top rim of the dutch oven started to rust. It was my understanding that an enameled dutch oven should last a good 10 years or more before undergoing any of these changes.I read on this review site that these pots are not actually made in the USA as was represented on Amazon when I purchased it, but that they are actually made in China. Had I known these were made in China, I would never have bought the thing.I am going to a local kitchen retailer today to find my daughter a Made in USA dutch oven to replace this thing. I am ashamed that I fell for this ""bargain"" priced item. When did Lodge begin producing such junk?Lodge Color Enameled Cast-Iron 6-Quart Dutch Oven, Island Spice"
4,Very good!,"Heats up quick and evenly. Doesn't stick like the non-enamal lined cast iron. A bit heavy but a great, quality piece."
2,Good price but still not worth it,I have had this pot for over a year. It cooks well but my biggest complaint is that it stained from the get go and only continues to stain more and more on the interior. I think it is unsightly. Tonight when I used it I was taking off the lid and accidently tapped the lid to the pot and a chunk of the red enamel on the outside of the lid broke off. That was the last straw for me. I am throwing this pot away. I ordered a Staub to replace it because it was a little better priced than a Le Creuset. To me it makes more sense to spend a couple hundred dollars on a pot I will have a lifetime than a $50 on a pot I will keep a year. I am surprised by all the great reviews for this pot. The reviews were why I chose it. But beware - all of the lesser priced pots are made in China.
4,"Heats Well, But Stains Easily","Well, I wanted to believe these would be as good as it's French Competition. It heats well, that's fine, but I find that food sticks, and it stains very easily. I always have to use a scour pad after use to get it looking clean."
5,"Love this pot, especially for the price","I have a smaller Le Creuset dutch oven, which I dearly love. But for occasional big batches of chili or roasts I wanted a really big pot. This one is fantastic, and the price is unbeatable. The color is deep and it looks great sitting out on my stove, it is oven safe to high temps, and it cleans up like a dream. This is a great alternative to the fancy french brand that gives you great results."
3,"Love it, except it does chip","I have had this for over 6 months and use it a couple times a week. While I do love using it, I have at least 4 chips around the top and around the handles and two of them happened in the first week. They aren't in an area where it really matters, but I do worry about rusting later. Because it keeps the heat in, I do love being able to simmer a roast at such low temperatures. I use the regular cast iron all the time. I do think that if I buy another piece of cast iron enamel, it won't be Lodge. If there is a great deal on Le Creuset, I am biting."
5,a great gift,"I've had this one (in red) for a year now. I use it for everything...roasts, soups, chile, sauces, etc. They all come out delicious! I love it so much that I've bought two more for gifts. It's a real bargain at the Amazon.com price...with free shipping to boot!"
5,Don't Bother with Le Creuset--especially that KNOB,"Got my Dutch oven and THRILLED with it. Lodge has stepped up and made enameled cast iron that competes with the best Le Creuset has to offer. Save the $200 price difference to buy more LODGE products. Oh, and the Amazon Recommends/Frequently Bought Together mention of changing out the knob is unnecessary: Lodge's knobs are now guaranteed to 500F degrees, too."
1,"Mine chipped, too.....","......After probably 10 uses or less. I was preheating it before putting in oil and food and as soon as it warmed up there was a big ""POP"" and enamel flakes all over the stove. Myabe it was the temp change from washing it to rangetop, but as I understand it, they are supposed to be able to handle this...."
3,Heat Empty??,"The color is great and I really looked forward to using it. However, in reading the materials that came with it, it states not to heat the dutch oven ""empty"" when, in fact, almost every recipe calls for heating first, then browning meat. Obviously the dutch oven is empty. I wrote Lodge for a clarification and never received a response. So ... I would not recommend this item until I know more about it and am confident I can use it without ruining it. Any suggestions would be welcome."
1,Faulty product,Purchased one which had a huge chunk of enamel missing from the inside. Returned that one and got another from Amazon. This one looked fine but when I quickly hand washed it before using it a small piece of enamel chipped off the bottom. Don't waste your money. The enamel doesn't stay on and once it chips it will only get bigger.
5,This is one of the nicest pieces of cook wear that I have ever purchased.,This is one of the nicest pieces of cook wear that I have ever purchased. The color is just wonderful and cooks well in the oven. Thanks
5,"Amazing, Affordable, and Perfect!","I purchased this for my sister for Christmas. She's wanted an enamel-coated dutch oven for quite some time and the Le Creuset brand just isn't in our budget. She was very excited when she received this and after using it, she's hooked! She doesn't even want to use any other cookware. This is completely worth the purchase! The pot is nice and heavy, the finish is beautiful and it's exactly what you're looking for with an enamel-coated dutch oven."
5,TERRIFIC!,The quality of Le Cruset and Lodge! The price that makes it available to all!Made a Beef Stew that melted in your mouth!!! Great for slow cooking and braising!!LOVE IT!
5,Great Value!,"We received our 6-quart, washed it, and immediately put it to use cooking a roast. The meat was perfectly cooked to the same consistency throughout. The clean up of the enameled dutch oven was quick and easy. We will definitely be looking at Lodge for our future cast iron purchases."
3,It's okay,"Very heavy and seems to be well made.However the meat gets stick to the pot very often, and it's very hard to clean it up afterwards."
5,KITCHEN ESSENTIAL,"I got a small Le Creuset dutch oven when I moved and let me just say that it is dusty on a shelf in my kitchen bc I'm constantly using this lodge piece! The color looks even more vibrant in person and I love serving in it. I own a lot of cast iron pots/pans/etc. and lodge is definitely the highest quality, especially for the price. My WAY smaller high-end enamel dutch oven cost about 3x what I paid for this and I really only use that for small batches of soup or sauces. To people complaining about it not being dishwasher safe: just add some water to the pot and let it come to a hard simmer, then scrub it out like you would anything else. It's crazy easy to clean! I highly reccomend this over higher end models and if you're really concerned with brands just tell everyone it's Le Creuset, they won't be able to tell the difference ;)"
2,Lid does NOT fit,"Lid does not fit, pops up on one side, have to bang it in, then I get flakes of cast iron in the pot. Was working with amazon to get a replacement, but the product is ""under review"" the person on the amazon help line could not tell me what what the reason was and the department that does the reviews sometimes responds to internal emails and sometimes does not. The help desk uses the web (the external web that we all get) to find out the status of a review....really amazon...really? Anyway, amazon does not let you post a picture...so hopefully they don't take out this link to imgur [...] so you can see for yourself.EDIT: ok so they did take out my link...this should work: imgur dot com slash 65T6H"
4,Lodge 6-Quart Dutch Oven,"I ordered this item after going back and forth after reading reviews. For the price, the item does its job. It's a great dutch oven if you do not want to spend over 100. I got this in the caribbean blue and it is a beautiful color. It is a litle heavy and will probably take me some time to get used to. I used this to make sauce and meatballs and just made sure I was extra careful with it. I would recommend buying this item."
5,fantastic,"Super high quality piece of cookware! This is one of those things where now that I have it, I can not imagine how I survived without it. I love how evenly it conducts heat. I've made beef short ribs in it a few times and its just an amazing experience. I love how the beef short ribs smell and sound when I sear them in it. Heavy duty and a fantastic value for the price."
2,Enamel Chipped Off,"The enamel is chipping off after only about a dozen or so careful uses and hand washing only. I've used a similar Le Creuset probably hundreds of times and it's still intact. Lodge has, however, agreed to replace the pot at no shipping cost, without my having to return the chipped pot to them."
4,"Great pot, great price!","This was just what I hoped for. Heavy duty, beautiful color. My only complaint is that the cast iron rim will rust..so dry it well after washing!"
2,"lid chipped within 2 months, MADE IN CHINA","I purchased the lodge version of this pan because I believed the US company and have several of their non-enameled pieces. I was very disappointed to see that this product was produced in China and then even more disappointed when the enamel started chipping off of the lid in a few short months. I have another enameled cast iron pot that I purchased from Costco/Kirkland, also made in China, that has far outperformed this Lodge piece."
1,Rick B.,I had to return this product because of the plastic knob on the lid. Who would design a cast iron dutch oven and use a plastic knob? Lodge should update this knob to stainless steel!!
2,Disappointing,"From reading the other reviews here I had high hopes for this dutch oven. Unfortunately, the interior stained almost immediately and every time I used it, the stains got worse. I tried soaking it in a baking soda solution and even a bleach solution but the stains remain. It does cook well and retains heat. It's too bad they don't just make these with a black interior to hide the stains!"
1,Lodge Color,"I own several American made Lodge cookware pieces. They are great and long lasting if used as directed. I give them 5 stars.As for the colored porcelain sets, the Lodge company decided to make them in Communist China.We do not eat anything made with any utensil, cookware, or anything else that touches food if made in Communist China.We have NO TRUST in them and fear the lead or other toxins they may infuse in items meant for the American market.If they were made in any other free country we would not hesitate to buy them.We will stick to the French made brands, albeit more expensive, until Lodge changes the place of manufacture to a safe and free country."
5,Excellent Value - It's Beautiful And It Works,"Well, I decided to make a very special braised short-rib dish for a large dinner party, and I did not have a large enough Dutch oven for the job and I did not want to spend $200-$300 at the time. I own the famous French brand in a smaller size, and honestly, I was a little worried if this would work as well. Not only was I extremely elated when I opened the box and saw how gorgeous it was, but it exceeded my expectations, and I did not miss the more expensive version. Very, very well made, and the self-basting effect worked just as you would hope it would. I still can't believe I got this beautiful and effective piece for under $100.00. Wow."
1,Made in China,"My fault for not reading the complete description. When I read that Lodge is an American company, I assumed it was made in the USA. American made Lodge products cost about double the imported selections.Sending back."
1,RED coating FLAKES off...what a mess,At first I loved this pot. Now I have had it for 2 years and probably cooked 6 pots of chili in it on a smooth top electric range. I have only hand washed it.The red coating is coming off inside and outside. I expected more of LODGE cast iron products.This review was on 10/3/2010.
1,Chipped enamel,"I purchased this Lodge Dutch Oven at Target today for $59.99-good price, BUT the enamel chipped while I was washing it in warm soapy water before putting it away. Mind you, I did not ever get to cook in it! I had read a few bad reviews that referred to chipped enamel, but since I'm very careful with my cookware and not too hard to please I thought I'd be fine. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. Maybe this is just an occasional problem, but I'll be returning my dutch oven for a refund. I won't be getting a replacement."
2,Chipped after one use!,"I was so excited to get this for Christmas. The blue is gorgeous, the pan worked beautifully, the bean soup was delicious, and all was well until I washed it--the enamel was completely non-stick, cleanup was a breeze--but when all the soup was washed off with a dishcloth, there was a chip! I had used a wooden spoon, no metal. My poor BF, not very internet savvy, somehow mistakenly ordered this through an external site, Ron's Home and Hardware. Not only did he not get free shipping, but we now have to hold our breath wondering whether he can return it and whether he'll have to pay return shipping, putting him out nearly $30 to be empty handed. I will update when I know the result, but in the meantime I cannot recommend this product and am not ordering a replacement. I'll save my pennies for a Le Crueset; they're indestructible."
5,Happy,Very nice product. Used it first day i bought it. Fast delivery. It is everything i thought it would be. Nice and solid. Heats evenly. made an awesome sauce with it. Love it.
3,the pot were the lid touched.,I order this via site-to-store. When I picked it up the packaging didn't seem very substantial given the weight and make-up of the pot. When I got it home and opened the box my fears were realized. The pot had numerous chips in the porcelain near the top of the pot were the lid touched.
5,Heavyweight Champion,"There is nothing crude about the casting of this Dutch oven. The form is smooth without any warps, dimples, or bumps. The cover fits perfectly. Likewise, the quality of the enamel is also excellent with even thickness and color. I use this pot several times a week for soups, stews, chicken, pot roasts and pork shoulder. The depth of the pot makes it ideal for browning meats without splattering grease all over the kitchen. The flat area at the bottom of the pot is small with gently sloping shoulders which makes the pot particularly useful for reducing juices and making sauces or gravy.The only caution I would have for prospective buyers is that this pot is large and very heavy. It takes some arm strength and a roomy sink to wash it up."
4,Great for the price!,"I love my new Lodge enameled Dutch oven! I feel like a ""real"" cook when I use it. I got it in blue which is perfect in my kitchen. You should know that this is a very heavy pot, as it should be since it is cast iron. Every time I use it, the thought flickers through my mind that if I ever dropped it, it would either break my foot or a couple of ceramic tiles on the floor. Or it could really chip the range top. PLEASE don't let that deter you from buying it - it is a great cooking utensil. Just be careful with it. As others have said, the knob on the cover needs replacing if you want to put the Dutch oven in a very hot oven. Lodge really should address that issue. I didn't mess around; I ordered the La Creuset knob for an additional $10. Since the Dutch oven was a very reasonable price, that was okay, but really, we shouldn't have to do that. Does anyone want/need my Lodge knob (lol)?"
5,lodge cast iron,"A great pot to cook different things. A little heavy especially when full but does well if you leave it on the burner until all of the stew is served. Great for stews, pot roast, spare ribs, pasta fagiole- any slow cooked meal."
5,Dutch Oven Bargain,"As most chefs know dutch ovens are NOT cheap, but they can produce some amazing dishes. This Lodge is incredibly well built and was delivered to our front door by our mailman. It is built to last a lifetime and we have no doubts that it will. You may want to consider the optional metal lid knob if you plan on doing some oven baking with it as well as stove top. Simply Amazing...!"
1,towel lover,"I bought this 2 years ago. I have only used it 4 or 5 times. Today, I was cooking corn in water on the stove at a low heat for only about 5 minutes. Later when the water had cooled and I poured it out, the enameling on the inside of the pan had flaked off. I couldn't believe that this Lodge Dutch Oven had failed so soon. Too late to return it! I was amazed the enamel was floating in the water. I will be writing to Lodge about this. Must be made in China. Won't buy this again."
5,Better Than Le Creuset and Other Cookware That Is 5X more expensive,"The durability, looks, heft, and lid fitting are in many ways better than a Le Creuset. For one, the lid handle is metal (and thus oven safe for higher temps) and the weight is more in line with Staub or other high end dutch ovens (Le Creuset runs a tad light). Lastly, the fit of the lid is especially good, which is usually the fatal flaw of the non-brand name dutch/french ovens. I would recommend this over a Staub or Le Creuset even if they were all the same price. Now only if it came in an oval shape..."
3,"Lodge Color Cutch Oven, red 6 quart","Like the dutch oven, however, it chipped shortly after I received it. Still usable.I have two other dutch oven's and have not had any chips on them after repeated use."
5,a gift well received,Beautiful color; well made; it's evern been used outside for a chuck wagon cook-out. Heats evenly; easily clean up; so far so chips or dings
2,hairline cracking,"My Lodge pot has hairline crackling through it.It is just a ok pot.I have a smaller Le Creuset which I LOVE,Think the enamel on Lodge is thinner.If you can only afford a Lodge it is better then nothing in that style of cookware.Le Creuset is worth saving up for!"
1,Failed on second use,The second time we used this pot the enamel chipped off of the interior in two places! We sent it back
5,Praise for Lodge Dutch Oven,"My coworkers had been raving about Dutch Oven cooking and Glorious One-Pot Meals by Elizabethh Yarnell. One woman told me Amazon had a sale on enameled cast-iron dutch ovens, and as the price was definitely right, I decided to try it. I have been SO pleased by the quality of the dutch oven and the variety of recipes. This is a great way to feed your family healthy meals with much less fuss and less expense."
2,Surface is not non-stick,"I wanted a non-stick surface to prepare dumplings, eggs and what not and I wanted something safe to prepare them in. I zeroed in on enamel coated surface after realizing that plain cast iron surfaces would need time to season/become non-stick and stainless steel was ruled out. I followed the instructions and heated this pan with oil in it. My pan cake stuck a bit the first time. After gently washing it with soapy water I tried eggs and the eggs just wouldn't leave the surface. Had to return it. I bought a plain cast iron pan as a replacement. It will take time to season but at-least I can use a steel spatula on a non-enameled surface."
4,"Works beautifully, but watch out for chipping","The color is beautiful (I have the island spice) and it works wonderfully. I have started to bake chicken in mine and it comes out moist and delicious, HOWEVER, the enamel chips off very easily. I have accidentally lightly bumped the lid against the lip of the bottom and chipped the enamel a few times. I mean very lightly, and I have chips around the top. Other than that, it is a very nice oven for the price."
1,Just what he wanted.,Just what my son wanted. The color was fabulous. He loves cooking in it. He thought it was so easy.
3,dutch oven,I received the item with a chip on the lid and side of the Dutch Oven. The packaging was was very messy and coming apart. I feel they should have told me that there where chips on the dutch oven when they were selling it.
1,Sent it back!,"When I opened the box - what a disappointment - the enamel was already flaked off a large area on the side and over one of the handles. Not only that, the Lodge enameled items are made in C-Hina, NOT the USA. I am NOT supporting overseas enterprises any more!"
2,Broken,The pot arrived cracked and scratched-- packaging was insufficient for transport. Company needs to upgrade packing operation. The whole thing needed to be packed in a larger carton with much more padding!
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this dutch oven. I opened the box and when I took off the cover of the oven there were already a few chips in the ceramic. I just sent it back and got a refund. I ended up spending more and getting one at Bed Bath and Beyond that was made in France and not in China. Hopefully, this one will last. It did not have any chips in the ceramic. It is not Le Creuset, but another company from France. Not as expensive as Le Creuset, but looks like as good quality."
3,Made in China,I was hoping this would be made in USA like other Lodge pans that I have but unfortunately it is made in China. After 6 months of use it has some chips in the enamel around the rim.
2,"1.5 yrs later of infrequent use, enamel chipped off","We have a ceramic stovetop and use the dutch oven from time to time, no oven use. Today a quarter-sized chunk of enamel flaked off on the bottom. Will see if Lodge will honor their lifetime warranty or not. If not we'll probably give Le Creuset a try."
4,Only a few issues,Haven't had it very long so the enamel lifetime may change my rating but the only thing I see as a weakness off the bat is the handle. I plan on replacing it with stainless steel because I need 450F.
4,WHITE INTERIOR STAINED FROM TOMATO SAUCE,"I should start by saying that I love this cookware, I had a cast iron version before but replaced it with this because I didn't like the fact that there was always this residue from the oil always left in the pot even after it was cleaned with soap and hot water. (yes the oil from seasoning the cast iron).The issue I am having now is after browning some chicken and now cooking some pork in a marinara sauce for an hour at 350 the sauce and the browning of the chicken both left discoloration or staining as it were inside the cookware. If anyone has a solution to this that wont harm the cookware I would love to hear it. Is bleach the answer? Otherwise I love this cookware."
4,Great dutch oven,"This is my first cast iron pot or pan. I LOVE IT! Who knew you could brown foods so well? I've been using non-stick for so long, I didn't know what I was missing.Great heat distribution, browning, all the things you need when cooking. The only negative is the pot is a little heavy, and shouldn't be put in the dishwasher. I have been hand washing it, but oh, I hate hand washing things!"
2,Don't Cook At High Temperature!,"I purchased this dutch oven on Amazon because it was on sale and looked attractive. Unfortunately, I used it without reading the directions that said it shouldn't be used at temperatures over 400 degrees.I made No Knead Bread with the dutch oven and cooked it at 450 degrees. Sure enough, the knob on the lid cracked and when I took out the bread, there was a nickel-sized hole in the enamel finish at the bottom of the pot.Just a word of warning that if your recipe calls for temperatures over 400 degrees, this oven is not for you."
5,Pot,"Is heavy, round, deep. Has a lid, and keeps food in it really well while you cook it. We like it plenty."
4,love this pot,"I use this pot to cook my okra and tomatoes. Works very much like any cast iron pot, so have to watch it for scorching and burning. I am careful to not burn food in it as the white porcelain interior scratches and stains."
4,"Nice, but not made in America","I ordered this pot thinking that it was made in the U.S., and I was very disappointed to see on the box that it is made in China. The pot is okay--substantial and undamaged on arrival--but the lid does not fit as well as the lid on my Le Creuset cast iron oven does, and the color is not as brilliant. The 7.5 quart size is the best feature; the large capacity allows making big batches of stews and related substantial fare. I was wowed at the price, but I found out why it was so low when I saw the country of origin on arrival."
1,get what you pay for...,"I wanted a cast iron to make stews in and to bake bread in. Unfortunately this isn't up to the job.The enamel on the bottom of the pot bubbled and cracked. When I contacted Lodge, they told me that heating it in the oven isn't proper use of the pot! I know lots of people use cast iron pots to bake bread, which requires preheating of the pot in the oven. If it can't stand up to 450F in the oven, I want a different pot.The machining of the top of the pot also isn't up to the quality you get with a more expensive version. Rather than machining the lip of the pot flush with the cover, it has three small nubs that make the cover appear to sit flush. You don't get a good seal and lose moisture that should be sealed into the pot.Do yourself a favor and skip this Chinese knockoff, and save a few extra clams to get the real thing, and deal with a company like Le Creuset that stands by their product."
5,Great quality cookware,"I just got this a few weeks ago and we've already used it to prepare three delicious meals- sauerkraut and kielbasa, and yummy pork loin and chops. The pork loin was perfect, if I may say so. Seared it and then baked it inside this with veggies and grapes, and it turned out perfectly.The lid on mine was a silver material, so it seems like that's what they're shipping with now.The blue color looks great, and it's a breeze to clean- just wipe with a soapy sponge and then towel dry it."
3,"Excellent dutch oven, but..................","An excellent value. However, the instructions state that cooking above 400 is not recommended. Most cast iron dutch ovens allow temperatures above 500 which is important."
1,Performed well until enamel cracked,"The third time I used this Dutch Oven the enamel surface developed a large crack on the bottom inside surface. No choice but to return it. Kudos to Amazon on their prompt, professional response in handling the return and credit."
4,"Nice dutch oven, but stains easily","I bought this dutch oven so I could make stews, such as gumbo, jambalaya, and chili. All the stews I make involve using powdered spices, which stained the sides and bottom of the dutch oven after just the first use. The stain came out the first time, but would restain every time I cooked in it, and just stopped coming out altogether. After a while, I noticed that the bottom was starting to have grey-ish marks on it, which may be due to scratches from the ladle. I've since switched to a plastic ladle, but the marks have not washed out, and seem to have gotten worse. I haven't been burning food at the bottom, and it doesn't look like there are any deposits; just discoloration.I only took off one star because overall the enamel has not worn off, and this dutch oven still produces excellent stews. I've had it for several months now, and my only complaint has been the staining and discolorations."
4,Great Kitchen Addition,"I was not so sure I would like this new product but with some special needs in my family driving my decision, I went into trying this with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the transition was to the Dutch Oven was. I use it almost every day. I love the versatility of this particular pan. I can use it like a crock pot and make soup stocks or if I need a quick meal I can make a large soup or big pot of spaghetti. It heats evenly and keeps the food warm longer than a regular pan! Clean up is a breeze. The only drawback that I have seen so far is that from the first time I used it, the pot has developed some brown rings on the bottom which make it look like it is always dirty, but it seems to work fine I would highly recommend this product."
3,It will make a fine planter.,"I purchased this item several years ago from a Lodge outlet store, and have used it constantly ever since. As a cooking vessel, it has performed admirably, especially when its relatively low price is taken into consideration. That said, its overall quality of manufacture has proven to be a disappointment. The outside enamel is showing significant chipping, and the interior is both scratched and chipped, although I have been careful to use only wooden or rubber-like utensils when cooking with it. Because of this, the initial thrill that I got from ""buying American"" has faded into actual embarassment, considering that my mother-in-law's 50 year old French-made product shows virtually no signs of such wear and tear, despite a lifetime of use. I think that Lodge might have done better to ask a few more bucks in order to offer a product of comparable quality and longevity."
3,6 qt dutch oven,"The size of the pot is fabulous and the cooking in the pot is good; however, when I washed it for the first time, I bumped it slightly on my sink and the finish chipped. I will say that when I called the company, they sent me a prepaid UPS label to send the dutch oven back to them. I was just very disappointed that a very slight bump would damage the finish to the extent that I was afraid to cook in it. I am hopeful that they will replace it with a pot for which the finish is more stable."
4,Pretty cool. Suits my needs. Looks sweet in the kitchen:),"I hesitate on the 5 stars only because I haven't used it very much yet - but the few times I have? NO complaints! I don't need to pay for the swanky ones:). It cooks well, it cleans well (you can hardcore ""caramelize"" and bake things, leaving crusty rings and it cleans effortlessly) and I'm a bit rough and tumble... I move things around alot in my small kitchen. I haven't had any chipping issues?I'll leave the big bucks for ""impressive"" brand appliances... No need here for a cooking vessel! This thing looks sweet and I my short ribs come out awesome;)."
5,Lodge Dutch oven blue 6quart,"Cannot afford Le Cruset however, I believe this is just as good. Easy clean up and makes great soups. Would definitely recommend this."
5,Good Product,"I have used this dutch oven for many purposes, such as soup, chili, and making pulled pork. The clean up is a breeze."
3,Given as a gift,"I bought this for my grandson who's an enthusiastic would-be chef. He needed a heavy-bottomed large pot in which to braise meats and simmer stews over several hours.As I have the same pot in red, I purchased this one for him in the hope that he'll have the same luck with his Lodge cast iron that I've enjoyed with mine."
2,Defective coating,"Ordered the 6 quart in red. The first one I received has chipped coating on the lid and scratches on the underside. Inside the pot there are several ball point pen size black spots. The black spots felt raised and looks like unsmoothed cast iron without enamel. I returned the first one without ever using it, and the replacement pot has the same problem, but slightly less spots. I return the second one and was willing to try my luck with a third pot. Amazon decided to not ship another replacement, because they can't be sure it won't have the same problem.Besides the defects I saw, the Dutch oven is nice and come with stainless steel nob."
1,Poor quality porcelain coating,"I received this as a gift about a year ago. I used it very gently about 10 - 12 times and hoped to have it for many years. Yesterday the porcelain interior began to crack, blister, and fall off. The top edge of the porcelain where the white part meets the black also had rust developing but I figured I could live with that. I have one of the more expensive French made pots that had many more years of use and still looks new. I would recommend spending the extra money to buy a better brand. (Sorry Lodge, but you have it coming). This cheaply made pot is cheap for a reason."
1,Defective Workmanship,"I purchased this product in April 2010. I then stored it carefully to prevent any rubbing. I opened to the pot for use for the first time--noticed a spot on the interior bottom & moved to gently brush off what I thought was a piece of fluff. It was not as more of the bottom interior also fluffed off. It was bubbled so it looked more would fall off into the food at the first stir. I took the pot to a Lodge Store in TN. The employees were dismayed at the quality and agreed that it should be returned. They however would not exchange it as it was purchased from Amazon. After 2 rounds with poor quality enameled cast iron. I recommend the purchase of cast iron pot--a little more care, but it will last a lifetime. Lodgeware is great stuff, just not this product."
4,"Excellent, but","The pan has met all of our expectations, but! We purchased the pan to make bread, and the handle has a temperature limit of 400 degrees. Our receipe calls for putting it in a 450 degree oven. So I rolled a piece of strap metal in about 1-1/4 circle and put the screw throught a drilled hole in the strap metal. It works great. maybe not as pretty as the original, but not bad. The circle makes it easy to pick it up with anything that is less than 1-1/4"" wide and keep hands away from the hot metal.Maurie Leising"
5,Great value! Highly recommend.,"This Lodge Cast-Iron dutch oven is a great value - excellent quality and a nice alternative to the very pricey Le Creuset. Unlike some of the other cheaper models, this does have enameled edges (although they aren't smooth). We wanted to use this for baking the no-knead bread and so we ordered the Le Creuset stainless replacement handle from Chef Central for $8.99 + shipping. It added another $17.50 to the cost, but was worth it. It allows us to put the entire thing in a very HOT oven and not worry about melting the original cover knob. We've used it for the bread, braising meat, and casseroles. Cooked nicely and cleaned up easily. I was a bit worried about the white interior staining when we braised the meat, but it came out okay."
3,"Needs to be a ""Watched Pot""","I'm a great fan of Dutch Oven cooking and find my 6 qt Lodge Enamel pot indispensable for company or making large meals. I purchased this item to have a smaller version for ""just the three of us"". I am disappointed that the lid does not fit as tightly as advertised and because of that requires more watching in the oven. It's OK, but not what I've come to expect from Lodge."
5,I absolutely love me dutch oven!,"I love every thing about this dutch oven from the color to the way it makes pot roast with veggies. I cook all the time, but this pot made the best pot roast I have ever tasted. The other plus is that it is so attractive that it sits on my cook top so I can show it off!!!! You will love it as much as I do. Debra"
4,Great Dutch Oven,"This is a great multi-use dutch Oven - stove top, oven. Others I have had could not be used for both and were rather light weight. This is a substancial piece of cookware. Color is great as well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a heavy weight multi use Dutch Oven.Its weight may be it's only drawback - It is heavy"
5,Yum,The possibilities are endless with this dutch oven. It is so heavy duty and easy to clean. Cooking a whole meal in one pot is great!
5,Bright color and cooks!,"The bright green color is nice addition to a kitchen. We have used this dutch oven several times and it cooks everything well (adobo chicken, soup, stew). The coating makes the dutch oven easy to clean."
1,$49 down the drain,"I purchased this item because I was hoping the enamel would prevent the food from sticking to the bottom, which was the case with aluminum dutch ovens.Well, I didn't mind the enamel discoloration and staining during first few times of use. But what really made me literally to toss it out into trash container is that there was no single time when food would NOT stick to the bottom and burn. I used all oils I could get my hands on. Olive, Sunflower, Corn, Vegetable, Soy, Sesame... even tried bacon fat. Last week it was the last straw and down the trash it went. I will buy a non-coated dutch oven next."
5,"Very pretty, makes cooking a joy!","The color of this dutch oven is so pretty! Almost didn't want to cook in it! I leave it sitting on my stove all the time, doesn't be-long hidden in the cupboard! It does work very well for soups and stews, and in the oven for roasts and chicken."
3,If it weren't for the hole,I've wanted a dutch oven forever but never could see investing that much money for a pot. This Lodge oven is just what I wanted for the price I wanted if it weren't for one thing. It has a spot(hole) in the inside bottom that is missing the enamel. I don't know if the black that is showing through the white is a black undercoat or the black of the cast iron showing through that will start to rust. It's a great pot for the price if not for that.
4,cast iron pot,"I am not much of a cook , but I really like this pot.It cooks evenly and there is no sticking which makes clean up a breeze."
5,no need for the expensive one,This cooks like the high priced one. Does an excellent job on everything. Very easy to clean up. would recommend to anyone.
4,Why didn't I buy sooner?,"I love this Dutch Oven and wonder why I haven't bought one sooner. So far I've made a fabulous speghetti sauce. Easy clean up. Just beware the enamal chips easily. I don't know if I had bought a higher end product whether I would have had this problem. The chip is small and happend when I was washing it, I was a bit careless while rinsing it seems. The chip is probably about 5mm and to this point hasn't caused a problem. If I find I use this pot alot I may upgrade to higher end Dutch Oven. I also bought the Le Creuset knob so I could put the whole thing in the oven."
5,great cookware,"I absoluteley love this pot, I have used it several times already in the short timethat I have purchased it.wish it had a little less weight."
4,6-Quart Dutch oven,"A pretty good pot, but it stains too easily requiring a thorough bleaching to remove it. Cooks well, looks great."
1,"It was good, then it started chipping...",I had a similar experience as the others who said the enamel started chipping. I never put it in the dishwasher or used anything but wooden spoons in it and it began chipping at the bottom of the pot. Black specks in your food is never good =(
2,Paint chips VERY easily,"I have had this pan for 3 months and have been very delicate with it. I use it often but I've only washed it by hand. However, we are starting to see several chips in the paint, particularly in the handles and we are not happy with it. It's a beautiful pan, but with the chipping it's looking less beautiful all the time!"
1,Loved the pot but it wasn't very durable.,"I loved this pot. I made soups and roast in it weekly. It was my favorite pot to cook in. Then one day while I was cooking up some onions in butter to make a soup, the enamel along the bottom started peeling off. I've not had this pot for a whole year yet. It should have lasted a lot longer than it has and I'm very disappointed with the quality."
4,Almost Perfect,"I own one of the larger, cast iron Lodge dutch ovens and was looking for something smaller that would be suitable for a single serving meal. The 3-Quart is the smallest size that's available. I didn't need or want the porcelain coating, but it does look nice : However it is a little harder to clean the the regular cast iron.Almost perfect? I'd love to see one that's a little smaller, this one is almost the same diameter as the larger ones. I'd rather have it deeper with a smaller diameter. But other than that it was a pleasure to cook with!"
5,Must have,"I always wanted to have a Dutch oven and I went looking from store to store and they were all so expensive and just not the right fit for me.One day i was browsing thru Amazon and saw the Lodge 6 quart Dutch Oven and i fell in Love with it I am an amzon prime member so i was all anxious to get my pot. it finally had arrived 2 days later and as soon as i got it i cooked with it i mad lentil soup, roasts, stews, and all kinds of diffrent meals in it. This is the best pot ever because the lid is so heavy it makes a real tight seal and keeps all the flavors in istead of just steaming away, so when you season your meals before hand use a little less then you normaly would so it wont be so ""salty"" if you know what a mean. Well i hope this helps everybody out a bit. I sure love my Dutch oven!!!!"
4,A pot for beef pot roast,This is a great pot for beef pot roast. Everything takes place in one pot and then cleanup is super easy.
1,Buyer Beware - NOT Made in the U.S.A.,"I have many Lodge cast iron pieces and love them. This 6 qt. enameld Dutch oven seemed like such a great value. Imagine my disappointment when I received it in a box marked, ""Made in China."" The return postage would be hefty for this item but I'm considering a return. I didn't see the ""Made in China"" anywhere in the product description. I wish I'd taken the time to read the reviews--such is shopping in a rush! Since Lodge has been producing fine cast ironware in Tennesse for the longest time, I had no reason to believe this was a Chinese import. ""Buyer beware!"""
1,bad lid,"The lid of the dutch oven had a piece of enamel missing. The piece of enamel was not in the box. This product was packed with the rest of my order, including DVDs and CDs, the case of one was crushed by the much heavier dutch oven. The individual package the oven came in was very old and ripped along one side, as though it had been in a warehouse forever. I'll have to return this. I am very dissatisfied. Also, this entire order has never showed up on my order history. One portion of the order has been charged with no notification of shipping or backorder. Again, very dissatisfied."
3,Still waiting,"To this date I HAVE NOT REC'D this item, I've sent several emails to no avail. I've asked for a refund, or the product. Seems there was a mix-up in shipping and no one has been willing to help me. As in my last email I said Amazon was about to loose a valuable customer."
1,No no-knead bread!,"If you are purchasing this pot, as I did, to make the famous No-knead bread DO NOT DO IT. Shortly after I got the pot I made the bread and within the first 5 minutes in the oven the plastic knob on the lid ""popped"" and the plastic was split apart and emitted a terrible plastic-chemical smell into my oven. I take responsibility in not checking that the maximum temperature the knob is rated for is 400 and the bread recipe calls for a 450 oven...I was too anxious to make this famous bread. I now own a beautiful pot that I cannot use the way I would like to."
1,I would not purchase this product again,"It STICKS. Everything I cook in it sticks. I have looked all over the internet to try and figure out how to stop it from sticking, but everything I read says it is a non-stick pot. Well, I have news for them, it STICKS.Lodge Color Enamel 7.5 Quart Dutch Oven, Caribbean Blue"
1,LODGE COLERED DUTCH OVEN,They do not state that the colored enamel dutch ovens are made in CHINA !!!! Check it out on Lodges site !!!! Lodge partnered with companys in CHINA. Stick with the original cast iron it is still mzde in the U S A !!!!
1,knockoff made in China,"What more can I say. destroy the economy some more. I buy Lodge for its strong American history and performance. It seems their enameled cast iron is simply meant to get some Christmas business from people wanted more expensive French cookware. I don't care if there is lead in it or not, buying anything made in China takes away American jobs. Lodge could have made them here."
4,great dutch oven,"What a great product, cooks evenly and works great for one pot meals. I've braised, made sauce and steeped everything from beef to veggies. I love this dutch oven."
4,favorite pot,"I call this my magic pot because everything I cook in it is perfection. Sauteeing, frying, braising, stewing, soup -- you name it, this pot has done an exceptional job. After 3 years of almost everyday use, I can see the enamel thinning at the bottom which is why there is a minus on the star. But I am very well pleased with it regardless. I must confess though that I did not give it the proper care it needed. It is very easy to clean though heavy and I must have scratched it with the wrong sponge at times. Three years ago I purchased it at forty dollars, a good deal. I am now looking for an addition (future replacement) and saw that prices have doubled. What's up with that?Also I love the color of this pan. i take photos of my dishes and the red color gives the photos a classic look :)"
3,Better than I hoped,"I was initially very happy with this product. However, six months after purchasing it began to chip and flake. Apparently this is a common problem. Good thing is they replaced it for free. (Built with quality in China of course.)I can't complain about the customer service, but I wont buy another product like this from Lodge again."
5,great buy,Bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Such a great implement for her cooking skills.
1,Garbage. Enamel flaking after 6 months,"I've used this product exactly according to the instructions.. not using it with a burner on high, not going above 400 F in the oven, etc. The bottom started flaking after 6 months. I used it maybe a dozen times total. Yeah, Lodge is going to replace it, but what good does that really do? I don't want a dutch oven that is going to start flaking again. Spend the extra $40 and get a refurbished Le Creuset."
5,This Dutch oven is amazing,"I love this dutch oven, I bought the other size (3 quart) too. It cooks so well, both on the stove top and the oven. Food always comes out beautifully. I've cooked a braised short rib dish in this, and just for comparison, cooked the same dish in another vessel and the time taken for it to cook was reduced by about 40 min using the cast iron dutch oven.This gives a good browning to your meat as well if you want to sear it first, before stewing/braising. I was afraid that it would be difficult to clean after that, but its surprisingly easy; the enamel makes it easy to wash in soapy water with sponge. Just keep in mind that it is on the heavy side.Well worth the money. Have used it many times since purchase, at least twice a week, it's quite the workhorse in the kitchen."
4,Good deal,It's good quality and a good price. It is a shame that Lodge is making these in China after being a 100% american made company for so many years.
2,poor design,"Lodge cast irons are just too heavy for me in general. And this one is impractical to use on my conduction cook top due to its curved bottom. I cooked once to make a chicken stock without the cover, using the lowest setting, and it still shut off the cook top. Maybe it'll work best in the oven."
5,wonderful,"Great pan, great price, will have for years and years, perfect size for cooking for three people. Better than my Le Crueset, which is a piece of junk and annoying me more every time I cook in it.Buy this pan and enjoy great food."
3,pot roasts,It is very heavy. I didn't expect this as my skillets (another brand with similar description) are amazingly light. It cooks fine - no complaint there - just don't like the weight.
5,does not work,"This ""oven"" is the worst. There are no temperature controls. I put a slice of leftover pizza in there for twenty minutes and it never even went above room temperature. I had to return it."
3,Testing?,"Hi All: Have any of you thought of having items such as this tested for lead? With so many lead caused recalls in the toy world I would like a blurb on every product page of cooking utensils or any thing that comes in contact with your mouth. A quick test for lead on randomly selected pots, plates etc. with the results open to all. Not that much to ask when health is concerned.KDM"
1,received the wrong size dutch oven,"I have receved the wrong size item and with the help of customer Rep i returned the item on 11-19-2007. I also waiting to receive the credit for the purchase price so that I can order this item again, and hopfuly this time get the right one."
4,good deal,"I have one of these and bought this for my mom's birthday. She loves it. The only thing is that mine (1yr later), stains and I wish I could get the stains out better but otherwise I love this dutch oven."
5,How Do I Love Thee Lodge?,"Sure everyone may dream of owning a le cruset, but not everyone can afford one. I bought this Lodge Dutch Oven in September and have used it many times since, both in the oven and on stove top. Since it is cast iron you will find it heavy, but it holds heat like a champion and allows me to burn a smaller propane flame when using it. I love that I can brown or sautee in the same pot that will hold the rest of the recipe and slow cook to perfection. One should read the owners manual for proper care and use to preserve the integrity of this cookware. It is easy to clean with soapy water and gentle scrubber. I honestly cant' think of any complaints and would recommend this Lodge brand to others."
2,Made in China,And extremely odd that the price varies so enormously depending on which color you select. I only mention the made in China point because Lodge is an American company that still makes its non-enameled cast iron products in Tennessee. I think they should be encouraged to bring the rest of their line back onshore. A pretty pot though.
3,chipped right out of the box,This item was chipped upon opening right out of the box. Had to return it for an exchange.
1,Damaged goods,"Someone wrote a review posted two days ago that the dutch oven they received was broken - well, mine was defective as well. It arrived with a chip on a handle and the enamel finish was all messy and peculiar on one side. I was suspicious right at the outset because the box it was in appeared to me to have been opened and retaped. Proceed with caution as it appears in at least two recent instances Amazon is distributing damaged goods."
3,HEAVY - HEAVY!,"It's Lodge for sure! It's HEAVY! The enamel finish isn't as good as the French dutch oven it replaced - it stained after one use, but does the trick with stews and soups."
1,Made in china,Why I bought this was because it use to be made in America. Not anymore it states on the warranty MADE IN CHINA. Very disappointed in amazon for not stating the truth that it says on the box. Thumbs down America this is what is wrong with America.
1,Rust on the rim...,"Upon very first use, there were several parts of the rim which started to rust. The rust, in combination with the steam, would then drip back into the pot...Not sure how safe it is to eat the rust, so I have only used this one time. Sad, because the pot in itself is very beautiful and a great size!"
2,Absolutely NOT the same as Le Creuset,"I purchased this exact item and was elated at first. It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. But in time I found that the bottom interior surface stained and it chipped easily. I was unhappily surprised to say the least. Lodge's non-enameled cast iron products,which I also own are superlative.Despite this experience with Lodge's enameled dutch oven, I purchased a Le Creuset enameled cast iron dutch oven because I found it on sale. There is a world of difference!!!The Le Creuset is flawlessly beautiful and it will last you forever just like my French and Belgian Friends said it would. After many months of use.....there are no chips, and no stains. Food comes out as expected. It is Non-stick, reliable cooking and easy to clean. So don't pinch those poor pennies of yours. Give them a rest. Purchase a Le Crueset dutch oven and you'll never need to have regret."
4,love it,I love this pot. It's my go to pot for everything. Cleans up beautifully. I love the way it conducts heat. The only fault I have found with it is that it is made by yet another American company that has their product produced in China.
5,Lodge Enameled Dutch Oven,"I order the cookware from amazon at a much lower price than other sites. Ihave used the pot numerous times and love it. It is a great pot for cooking soups, stews and braising."
2,lodge is no le creuset - evaluated for a year before writing this review,"I can't say I enjoyed this product, which I finally threw out. Thin cast iron, means burned food (a lot!), it stained horribly, the enamel chipped off the outside around the edges of the pan and the lid, and ultimately it was more trouble than it was worth. Finally a badly burned interior meant the enamel came off before the burned substance.In contrast to my le creuset pan (admittedly smaller), that never burns, never stains, never chips...Yes cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Interesting experiment, I won't buy one of the lodge enamelled products again, though.FOLLOWUP: Tramontina has a lovely alternative (which is holding up much better than the Lodge, after about 4 months of use) - similar to Le Creuset except much heavier. You might want to check out my evaluation on that product here on Amazon."
1,Dont waste your money!,If I could give this zero stars I would. I actually bought this from a Local retail shop and returned it 4 times because every single one was chipped or damaged (before I even used it). I wish I'd learned my lesson because I finally found one that was not damaged and it was used just a few times and both the lid and the bottom are chipped.I've got lodge cast iron thats not enameled and its proven to be a great purchase that I've used for years. The enamel just is not applied properly and its easily chipped.
3,OK for the money but would pay more if made in the USA,"It's made in China and it shows. I have been extremely careful with this pot and yet I'm seeing rust in one spot around the rim. Also, the lid has three equally spaced protrusions that keep it from making a tight seal. I wouldn't buy from Lodge again unless they brought the manufacturing back to the USA. If this is the type of cookware you really want, go with the real deal and get Le Cruset. (I have a smaller pot by them and the quality is much better)"
3,Not self-basting lid,"The inside of the lid is smooth. Hence, this is not a self-basting lid. A self-basting lid has little bumps to enhance condensation while cooking. Also the blue color is not quite as vibrant as shown on the picture. I returned it for these reasons."
4,Very Nice,"I bought this after reading many of the reviews here. YES I know it is made in China. It is still the BEST out here for the money. You could spend $150 more but this pan is great. I checked it for any chips etc. upon arrival and all was well. If not I would have returned it for a replacement. It cooks really well. Everything I have cooked in it has turn out just fine. I use it daily. The ONLY problem it the plastic knob. I did as others mentioned here and purchased a metal knob to replace the plastic one. I used the ""Le Creuset Replacement Knob"" available here on Amazon and it looks very nice and fits perfectly."
2,Lodge Logic enameled cast iron 6 Quart Dutch oven,I used this dutch oven once and it the enamel has already chipped.Not impressed.
1,Definitely NOT Le Creuset on a budget,"I purchased this dutch oven specifically to make no-knead bread. I have a Le Creuset 3 1/2 quart dutch oven, which I have used for almost 20 years. However, the recipe for the bread calls for a 5-6 quart oven, and not wanting to spend a small fortune, I opted for the Lodge. Boy, that was a mistake. I just unpacked it, and as one reviewer noted, there are three raised areas on the lid which don't allow it to seat properly on the pot, and in my opinion that pretty much renders this pot useless. I was hoping that was an anamoly, but apparently not. What good is a dutch oven that doesn't have a tight fitting lid, might as well use a roasting pan. It's going back. The best thing I can say is that it did have a nice color and weight to it. But they really need to fix that problem with the lid. That old adage really does apply - ""you get what you pay for"". Guess I'll start saving my pennies for a new Le Creuset."
3,it has performed admirably.,"If you'd like own this unique and indispensable kitchen tool without paying a huge premium for that French one, this one should make your top picks list. I've only had it for a couple of months, but have used it 4 times and it has performed admirably. The lid seals well and cleanup is a breeze."
4,Best substitute for the expensive French brand,"Best substitute for the French brand that I have. It's worth the price I paid. Very nice color, easy to clean but I noticed some rusting on the rim after I used it the second time. It has to be cleaned and wiped very dry before storage to prevent rusting. Being an enameled item, it should not rust but I guess some parts was not enameled thus the rusting but otherwise a nice addition to my collection!"
5,Awesome!,"It was more than what I was expecting. I really like this pan. The color in the picture is not exactly like the color in person. It's not as bright. Although, I still love the color. I really recommend this dutch oven pan."
3,"Lodge Color Dutch Oven, Island Spice Red",The enamel on this product tends to chip. As I have said it is not the same quality as my Le Creuset cookware so you tend to get what you pay for.
5,Great product and great price!,"This was very well made it was a gift, and the person who recieved it absolutely loved it. It was for a man, and I thought the 70's brown color would be perfect and it was. Really does give it a retro look. Dutch ovens can be very expensive, so for the price I was a little nervous that it would look cheap, but it was the opposite, it looked as though it was a high priced dutch oven. There were no flaws in the enamel. I can't tell you how it cooks since it was a gift, but visually, it's beautiful!"
2,The enamel bottom burns easily,"I've had my lodge dutch oven for about 2 years now (received as a gift). In the beginning, it was great. Le Creuset on a budget. But over time, the enamel wears on the base of the pot, causing food items to stick. By comparison, I also have two Staub cocottes which I have had zero issues with food items sticking.If you're looking for a dutch oven for the long haul, I would not recommend this. However, if you're satisfied with as short-term pot, this will do just fine."
4,Great value,"I've had the 7.5 qt. dutch oven for about 6 months and use it at least two or three times a week, cooking for 7 people, and I really love it! I will say though, that it has started to chip on both the inside and outside and from day 1, there was a slight rise in the center that made foods burn and stick in that one specific spot.One reviewer commented on the discoloration at higher temps and we've noticed that as well. I don't know if that's a real concern or not but it did surprise me when it happened.Considering that I've read reviews where people with Le Creuset have chips as well, I would say that the Lodge dutch oven is well worth the price and is not a disappointment. I've definitely gotten my money's worth!"
3,Great starter dutch oven for the price,I bought this dutch oven after debating between a LeCrueset and the Lodge. I went with the cheaper option. Its a great dutch oven for a starter home cook. However recently the finish has started chipping off. I am not one of those people who uses things roughly so I was a little disappointed.
3,For The Much Much Cheaper Price--,"--is it worth it when the rim of the pot chips with the first use? With a pan so heavy, it's hard to handle it with kid gloves. Not sure where this happened, but my guess is trying to maneuver the pan in the sink to clean it. Not sure with the chip, how safe it is to use the pan. Cringing at the thought of paying the Le Creuset prices."
3,Lodge Enameled Cast-Iron 3 Qt Dutch Oven,"This is a fairly good dutch oven for the price. You just need to baby it a little. My experience after a year of regular use according to the instructions included with the pan -Pros: cooks evenly, holds the heat, nice size, attractiveCons: lid does not sit tightly on pan (good for slowly reducing, but not for retaining moisture in the oven) stains easily, enamel cannot tolerate the heat of browning meat, after a while in use cannot be soaked because tiny enamel faults start to rust - especially around the rimI brown meat and vegetables in another pan, and then make the stew/braise in this pan if I want a long, slow reduction of the liquid. I do not think it equal to a LeCreuset, but the price seems fair for what it is."
3,So much for chip resistant enamel,"My wife had just taken the dutch oven out of the box and was setting down the lid and it bumped the bottom portion of the oven. It immediately chipped leaving exposed white enamel. It was as small dent... may 1/8"" in circumference, but still a chip right out of the box. The description said "" chip resistant"", but if a slight bump which my wife described as nothing more than you'd do when placing the lid on anyway, resulted in chipped enamal, I'd say it isn't very chip resistant."
2,Disappointing.,"I was so excited when I learned that Lodge made enameled cast iron. The price is great and I like to buy American whenever I can. Alas, the quality is not what I'd hoped. I've had it for about a year, and use it perhaps once every two weeks. The inside enamel is covered with little cracks. I'll get a few more uses out of it but I'll have to discard it soon.I own one of the pricey French pans, a small one. I've had it for 20 years and it's still in perfect condition. I'll be buying another one, to replace this Lodge pan."
5,"Lovely, useful, and works with an induction burner","I have an induction burner, which means that I am limited to cookware that is made of steel or cast iron. I took a chance that the enameled cast iron would work on my device, and it does! This is a lovely and well made piece, large enough for stews. It cleans up easily. I like the look of it so much, I leave it on my counter."
2,Cheap and Chippy - Crackled All Over!,"I couldn't afford a Le Creuset just yet (not many can) so I settled on this from Amazon after reading great reviews about it. One thing is certain, it is a bargain. However, it chipped within the first month of use, revealing the cast iron underneath. Then, something peculiar began to happen. The interior cream enamel developed a million little micro-cracks, so much so that after about 8 months of use, the surface resembled an ancient oil painting. This was after the chips continued to develop and grow. Pretty soon, I had to throw it away because I couldn't trust that I wouldn't bite down on a piece of it and break a tooth. I now own two Le Creuset pieces and have yet to see a chip, crack, or any defect after months of use. I supposed you get what you pay for."
4,Not what I saw in person at the mall.,"This was bought as a Christmas present. I ordered it online to save a few dollars after having seen it in a store at the mall. When it arrived it appeared to be the same item I had examined in person with the exception of the words ""Made in China"" on the box replacing the ""Made in USA"" on the piece I had seen. I can't really blame Amazon for this but it was a bit disappointing since I was expecting something from South Pittsburgh, TN. Would it be too much to list the country of origin on merchandise listed for sale?"
2,must have gotten defective one,I have always heard that Lodge products were great and the reviews that I read about this item seemed to back that up but I must have gotten the bad apple of the bunch because the enamel chipped off in the bottom of the pan after only one use. I declined a replacement as I was very worried that the same thing would happen again. Amazon was very good about my return of the item and refunding my purchase price which I appreciated . I still am on the look out for a good enameled cast iron dutch oven that doesn't cost an arm and a leg but that is good quality. (note: I was not using a metal utensil or high heat so the pan was definitely defective)
1,Don't be fooled! Not american made,I purchased this Dutch Oven when I read a review stating this comes from a little company in the USA. When I received the box it stated made in China. I called the company and they said that all their Enameled Dutch Ovens come from China. This is a big concern since there has been issues with China's lead addition to their paints. We've addressed this issue to some extent with Children toys manufactured in China but I am hesitant to believe that all their addition of lead in other products have been eliminated.
1,Usable for less than a year,The enamel finish began crazing within a month of purchase and started to chip off within 6 months.
3,"Great Show ,Rough Sound In Spots","Information about their brief US '72 tour is sketchy at best, and this is the only recording that has surfaced from that period. This 5 cut live CD features versions of ""Mistreated"", ""Split Pt. 1"",""Cherry Red"",""Groundhog"", and ""Still A Fool"".I'm told this was recorded somewhere in Texas, and on this tour they were the low act on the bill with Humble Pie and Edgar Winter. The sound is rough in some spots and compressed a little weird and there's plenty of tape hiss, but the performance smokes, and Hogs fans will find many of the extended jams(all the tunes are extended and quite long) to be very different from those they've heard on other live releases. Not perfect but not a bad addition to your collection,get it while you can!!!"
1,Groundhogs US Tour,"Wow I can't believe this record company is ripping off there customers this way.This is NOT the Groundhogs in the US, especially in Texas.This is a BBC session from England circa 1971 masked with a new cover to hide the fact.Yes The Hogs played in the US in the early 70's but those tapes have never surfaced case in point Tony Mcphee said in a interview a few years ago that he did not even think the masters survived.No wonder Tonys upset,how can you seriously make any dosh if evrybody is taking your work and changing titles and leading hoinest hard working people that they may have found a unreleased gem when to find out its just rehashed shit from a show in europe 1971."
1,oh well,"I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one. NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote. I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled. They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all. This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst. I know some might disagree, and that's fine. I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards. Sorry NFG! I still love you! In a manly hitting each other sort of way."
5,"It's not Catalyst, it's better","Catalyst was a catchy album... it had some good songs, but it also had some weak songs. This album has the best vocals I've heard from Jordan on any album. It also had the best lyrics of any of their albums. Catalyst has a different sound than this album, so if thats what hooked you to NFG then you probably won't like this one. If you're a fan of the pre-Catalyst then this album is for you. It sounds like a more mature, pre-Catalyst, NFG."
2,New Found Glory feat. lyrical stylings of Michael Bolton,"Jordan P just really seems to be trying way to f*cking hard to recapture the clever lyrics he wrote all over Sticks and Stones.For the most part the CD is a bunch of bullsh^t ballads that fall short and the only semi-punk song has the chorus, ""doo, do, da, doo, do, do, doa, do.""Seriously!"
2,You're kidding right?!?,The only reason I am giving this two stars is because of all the past NFG cds. THIS CD SUCKS! Seriously what were they thinking? Where is the energy? Where is the punk? Nothing but sloooooowwww ballad after ballad. I am really disappointed with what I thought would be one of the greatest cds of the year.
4,Very Comfortable and Expresses their Maturity,"When I heard that somebody who produced Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy was producing their new album, I was kinda skeptical. But I think that in the end, this guy really helped them find a very listener-friendly sound that can appeal to a wide audience, if that's what they were going for.Whatever their plans were for this album, they worked and it turned out well."
3,"Okay, so you ""matured"", now what?","Say what you want to about NFG, but they've basically shaped the pop-punk landscape since 1999, and because of their unique sound and catchy songwriting abilities, many bands who play similar music today claim NFG as a major influence. Well, here we are in 2006, and after listening to this new record many times over, I have no choice but to call a spade a spade; Coming Home is mediocre. As far as vocals go, Jordan's are totally off, blending in to a more generic platform ala acceptance or nickelback, rather than buliding on the sugary nasil quality found on previous releases. Musically, the POP has dominated the punk, which is never a good thing, especially for a band like NFG! Of the 13 songs collected here, 2 or 3 are worth a listen, and the rest are pretty much throw away material. I've never heard an NFG song I didn't like...until today. Take my advice; throw on some 'Nothing Gold Can Stay', rock out, and forget 'Coming Home'."
2,Worked Great untill I plugged in a wet saw,"I have two of these one in the garage on in my shop. I used this in my garage for several years and loved it! Not only great having it there for all my outside electric needs, but we used the cord hanging down to tell how far to pull in the car (till the plug touched the car windshield)Today I had to rent a diamond wet saw to cut some concrete block. About 30 seconds into the first cut the 20 amp circut breaker tripped in the house. I don't see anything on the cord, but every time you try to plug it in it trips the circut-guess this thing is toast!! I guess I'll look for something with heaver guage wire for a replacement. This is a great product, but with 16 gage wire becareful what you plug into it."
1,Bad Choice for the Garage!,Know what you are buying! I plugged in a table saw into the reel and it blew within a minute. If you are thinking on using it for electric tools that draw the amps this is not for you!
3,Be careful,"With the small gauge wire, be sure not to put much of a load on this. With the cord wound on the reel, the heat has nowhere to go, and the insulation will melt into an unusable mess long before a 20 amp circuit breaker flips.Edit: I should clarify that my review is not based on this specific product, but on what I would consider an identical one purchased elsewhere. Same design, same gauge wire; looked exactly the same. My mother connected two small ceramic space heaters to it with most of the cord still wound on the reel. Result: a melted mass of uselessness that could perhaps have caused a fire. And the 20 amp breaker never flipped. It's confining all that resistance-generated heat into a small area that causes the problem.Other than that, pretty handy!"
1,Don't buy if you expect the cord to lock in place at various lengths!!!,"I had two previous extension cord reels from two different manufacturers. I had ASSUMED this reel would include the same MAJOR feature, which is the ability for the cord to stop and lock in place at various lengths. When you pull down a window shade, you expect it to stay in place yes? Then you pull down slightly on the shade and what happens? It winds back up yes? My two previous extension cord reels had this feature, and I am really surprised this one did not. It is one of the MAJOR reasons I bought this thing. Using the plastic ball they give you to lock off the length of cord you want to use is rediculous."
1,Terrible quality mounting hardware,"It never ceases to amaze me how a company will include bottom of the barrel hardware. What are they saving maybe fractions of a penny? The included wood screws are flat heads instead of phillips. The flat head stripped almost immediately, and as I got to about a 1/4 inch from being screwed in, the screw broke in half. See photo."
4,So Convenient,We put this in the garage near the door and it's so convenient. So far it works great and we've had no problems. It mounted easily to the wall.
3,"a ""coffee table"" book for shell lovers...","this book comes up in Amazon's search engine as a shell craft book. That is misleading, and if you buy it for that reason you will be dissappointed. The author does include a few blurbs about shell crafts and recipes. BUT, the vast majority of the book is a mid size, watercolor art book of various shells the author admires. The art work is lovely, and would be appreciated by a shell collector-but as pretty as the book is-content wise it's not more than just ""eye candy"".So, if you're looking for shell crafts, education, or a shell guide-I'd say skip it. If you are looking for a lovely gift for the shell collection in your life then pick it up.3.5 stars."
4,Neptune's Garden-Shells A to Z,"A beautifully illustrated book. A wonderful gift for an artist, a child, or seashore lover."
4,I,... but the bottle was not full. Maybe had been used before? Oh well. Too lazy to return it. That's why I'm not giving it a 5.
1,Product came Damaged!,I was not able to use this product because it came in a broken bottle..Thick conditioner had soaken thru the paper packaging....I would not recommend it.
3,"Not a great literary work, but interesting","99% of this book is a collection of stories about the AFL by former players, coaches, administrators, owners, and others with some connection to the game. It is interesting, but not a great book. Most interesting is the explanation about how NBC cut off the Heidi game. Typical corporate move from the beginning to the end. Nobody had any objection throughout the week of the proposed cutoff and none of the ""suits"" could make a decision at crunch time. NBC has never lived the Heidi game down and it will always be remembered in sports broadcasting."
2,Where are the pictures?,"I like photographs when planning. It helps me feel a bit more secure about my choices. Having lived abroad most of my life, I've seen that drawings can be deceiving. Tons of information though. That's good. But for me, not enough to commit."
2,Disturbing and NOT as good as good as V.C. Andrews.,"I just finished this book today. It was quick read, but I don't agree with it being compared to V.C. Andrews. Flowers in the Attic had heart while this book falls flat. The author tries too hard to copy the style of Andrews and fails. Innocent Dark is very disturbing. I would compare it more with John Saul's novels. It's hard to identify with the characters and even though there were a couple shocks along the way, you could see the ending from a mile away. I purchased the sequel at the same time I bought the first so I'm going to read it out of curiosity. Don't get me wrong, it's an ok read and if you like gothic horror with a little gore thrown in you'll probably enjoy it."
3,BlackFeet,Not sure what I wanted but this didn't hold my attention. It did at first but then the stories got long and dark. I think I wanted more history.
3,"Good tips, but may not fit your iron/","I bought these without giving the image a good look over. These will NOT fit an Aoyue 937+ soldering station. They seem to be quality tips, but make sure they will fit you iron before you place your order."
1,"Tips for Weller? ok, sure...","I only got these because the ad from Amazon said ""People who bought the Weller usually bought these!!"".So I bought them. THEY DON'T FIT!!!THEY ARE THE WRONG TYPE!!So, don't buy them for a Weller iron because they won't fit, and because they look really cheap, like most stuff from China.The guy who shipped them even couldn't believe Amazon was still doing this as I was the 10th guy to have to return them. He wasn't happy. But he took good care of me.Dave B."
2,"boring, lacks conflict","The back saysHe wants her for one night only. Spanish billionaire Raul Carreras is used to getting what he wants: Nell rose will be his for only one night, and for his pleasure! Then she becomes pregnant with his child. Raul's red-hot seduction is hard to resist. But when Nell falls pregnant with her Spanish lover's child, will she tell him?The story begins with Raul's neice and nephew running away and he thinks they have been kidnapped. They run to Nell their former nanny, and Raul thinks that Nell is his brothers former mistress. So anyway he treats her like crap but asks her to come and be the childrens nanny again and help them adjust to a new life w/o their father who died recently. I won't give away the whole story but in my opinion the book was very boring and I am suprised I was able to read the whole thing. There was nothing even very dramatic about her pregancy. The way he found out was kind of cheesy if you ask me."
2,It was ok,I gave this product two stars because it smelled good!! I have def. had the pleasure of using much better lip balm!!
5,This book is the killer click.,Excellent book. Very practical approach to an extremelly complex and soft subject.
3,Average Halloween costume,"Decent costume quality, nothing great. Typical Halloween material. Ordered small, have room to spare (I'm 5'9"", size 4). Most Indian costumes are too short but this is a good length for me. More yellow than pictured."
4,good guide,"If you have been contemplating VoIP but are fuzzy on the details, Ledford offers some insight. She walks you through a good general guide of what VoIP is, from a user's perspective, not an engineer's. You can see that VoIP offers a far richer feature set than Plain Old Telephone Service. Though the exact features in a given VoIP varies with its provider. At least for US readers, the book summarises who the main providers are and typically what each offers, and for how much.Also, the book surveys VoIP equipment and which you might want to get.Of course, Skype gets prominent mention, as the best known pure VoIP play."
5,Especially good garden designs in Appendix.,"About 4 years ago I planted out a fairly close version of the largest peony garden recommended in Appendix III. It has been a joy! The peony plant itself changes character over the growing season, and this design reflects that character and the colors. Visually, it's a different garden every few weeks! The book itself contains a lot of good information, very carefully done, I believe."
2,Disappointing,"Virgil Fox deserves a better portrait than this. He had a positive impact on the music scene and popularized the organ as no one since E. Power Biggs. His playing was controversial, of course, but always musical on its own terms. This book is written in a gushing tone that grows frustrating. As you turn the pages you begin to wish the author had not chosen to relate his acquaintance with Fox through a succession of amusing anecdotes; the ""look what he's done now!"" approach loses its effect quickly. If you took out half of the exclamation marks, the book would be fifty pages shorter. Skip this one and hope a better book appears soon"
4,Humminbird Transducer,"I had my douths about the item ,but after I had it mouted and in the water it worked great with the 400SX head, and it was a breeze to install."
4,Well made sandals,Sandals seem very tight at first but I wore them for progressively longer periods each day until they loosened up and conformed to my feet. Now they are extremely comfortable. They seem durable and my son says they are the best sandals out there. The only reason they are not 5 stars is the footbed is a little slick but my son said once they wear in a little more that goes away. This is easily the best pair of flip flops I have ever owned
5,Fantastic Sandles,"The sandles are comfortable, nice looking, fairly inexpensive, and all in all I love them. Will definitely recommend to all."
5,"Finally, the best!","I finally decided to pay up and get the rainbows and i'm glad i did. After years of wearing off brand flip flops around the beach these are definitely superior. They take a bit to break in and after a little pain they are very comfortable. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for, top quality leather and construction with a lifetime guarantee!!!"
4,Replacement for old reefs,"I bought these as a replacement pair for the old leather Reef flip flops that I loved but they no longer make. As stated in other reviews, expect a serious break in period. These sandals are very tight at first and actually rubbed the tops of my feet raw the first time I wore them for an extend period of walking. However, the straps stretch out and the foot bed compresses down so they loosen up and really do become very comfortable. If you can deal with a couple uncomfortable days at first in exchange for (hopefully) a few years of solid comfort, go ahead and pick a pair up."
5,Awesome,Great item fast shipping. Will order from again. Item was better then what was showen in photo. The only thing that would make them better would be if they were free.
1,Rainbows or not?,"The Rainbow sandals I ordered are very, very narrow. I am sending them back and will look for another brand of sandal."
4,good flop,"good flops. my bf wears a 12 and this are a little snug. probably should have gone a size up, but rainbows also stretch and form to the feet. i love my women's rainbows."
4,So far so good,"I have never spent so much on sandals in my life, but after numerous friends and reviews extolling the virtues of these scandals, I gave it a shot. Everyone talks about making it through the break-in period as the scandals conform to your foot. The trick, as others have said, is a really hot shower on day 1 (i even did day 2) and then walk and walk and walk. I am a week into them and they already feel like a glove on my feet.Hoping they stand up to for years to come. Probably not fair to rate if 4 out of 5 as everything is as expected to date, but I can't see the future and have know way of knowing if these things will last the years everyone is claiming.They are true to size and color matched the photo."
1,Horrible,I've always worn Scott Hawaii and Reef sandals but I decided to try out Rainbows. Bad decision. I wore them for less than 5 minutes and I had a piece of flesh removed on top of my left foot from the rough leather underneath the strap. On my right foot I had started to develop a blister. These are going in the trash.
5,Still going after 4 years,"Have had these since late high school, great durable pair of flip flops. Super comfortable and fit my foot incredibly well. Best pair of flops I've ever had, will get them again no doubt."
4,Second pair bought,"and like the first pair owned, it takes some breaking in of the sandal. Can hurt the foot for awhile."
5,excellent,The gift recipient was very happy to receive them for Christmas and he says they are comfortable and nice looking on the feet
1,Buy Reefs instead,"WTF is with a 2 week break in period? I guess once they stop torturing you the relief must make them feel that much more comfortable. I have worn these for a day at a time, a total of ten days, over the past year. They still are abrasive and tight and I am throwing them away. My Reefs have lasted me 2 years running, were comfortable out of the box, and are still comfortable."
2,Ouch,"The product looks good and appears very sturdy. However, after breaking them in for a few days around the house I wore them on vacation and developed a really nasty blister/scab on the top of my left foot. It is really sore and ugly. I did not do anything more than walk around the house and the beach. I am hopeful this won't happen again but certainly not a good first impression of the product."
2,it could have been good,"When I read the back of this book in the library, I thought it seemed great. When I started reading I quickly realized that no matter how good the plot was, the writing was going to make it a boring read. It was. Alot of fist person books only describes what is going on right then. This book tells both what is going on then, and little details that the character doesnt know yet at the time it is happening. For example, she says once what the kidnappers name is, but she adds that of course she didn't know that then. It just takes the excitement away."
5,Jazz at its Best!,"The Great Jazz Trio was never better than when they played the Village Vanguard in 1977. Hank Jones on piano, Ron carter on bass and Tony Williams on drums are all at the top of their games here. The music is dynamic and exciting, and always tasteful. Tony Williams playing on Moose the Mooche is incredible.I purchased this performance on lp in the 70's it has ranked as my favorite works of the Great Jazz Trio. Hank Jones has led this group with other bass players and other drummers, including his brother Elvin in 2002 and 2003. But for my money this lineup and in particular this CD, is the best of the bunch. And by the way, they are all great."
4,4 stars for the research employed in the book,i gave this 4 stars for the hard work on the road the author put to gather these interviews from boser--a lot of whom probably we never would not have heard from again if he did not compile these interviewsmy criticisms of the book are that a lot of the writing from both the author and subjects are too many run on sentences flowing endlessly making it hard to stay interested
3,Great start but got old quickly,"The premise of the book is excellent in that the history of the fighters should be preserved and we do need to document their stories but I think the book could have been written less as it was told, but more in the conventional manner in order to make it easier to read.The stories started to blend together after a while, as they were a few pages each, all written as the fighter told the author, so the book lost some interest to me as it went along.Perhaps more space to devoted to the old time fighters like Gunboat Smith and Willie Ritchie.I might even have done away with the whole section on the fighter who was saying that he was an assassin when he was young. If you know they are telling a fiction story, don't waste your time.The articles on fighters were a great read though. The author put a lot of work into it and should be commended."
1,Poor business practices,Amazon is a ripoff. I would have gotten a better deal at my campus bookstore. I will NEVER shop here again!!!
3,Try the YouTube Nursing Skill Videos,"A lot of these same skills can be seen on youtube andSaddleback.eduhas 152 FREE medical skills videos of excellent quality for FREE.Also, (Try Hawknurse on youtubeNurseCentral on youtube) Just to name a few.Just look up a skill and there are usually many to choose from, some betterexplained than others, but I found them to be better than some videos wehad to purchase for our classes.Also, LearnersTV.comThis is just a SAMPLE of FREE Medical teaching online."
5,Great confidence builder!,"I found these DVD's very helpful in the beginning of my nursing courses. The practical side of nursing is very scary at first, and you have very few opportunities to practice before working with real patients. Also, nursing instructors can be less than understanding if you completely forget how to do something, not to mention embarrassing yourself in front of the patient. Our college also had simulation competencies that had to be passed. The videos were very helpful with that. Another thing they came in handy for was our ""labs."" Whether our lab was going to be on wound care, assessment, injections, etc; there was almost always a video that would help me prepare for it. I would highly recommend these videos to any starting nursing students looking to increase their confidence and skills."
3,havent used it yet,thought it was going to be a play by play but you actually have to choose the videos you want to watch and they are only clips. this was what i needed for my class so it works
2,"Okay, I guess...","These videos were alright for the first semester of nursing school to get an idea of basic tasks but I couldn't stand all the remote control clicking that had to be done to access the additional information, questions, etc. These videos should of come with a book or something. It aggravated me to the point that I stopped using the videos altogether."
4,Rachel Ray's Knife,I Could be wrong but I believe this is the same knife Rachel Ray uses on her show 30-Minute Meals on the Food Network.
4,Very SHARP,Great Knife! My husband gifted me with it for Christmas. I had been complaining that our knives( which are those eversharp seraded edge ones) always rip up raw meat when I am trying to cut it fine. This knife on the other hand is PERFECT for the job. It is excellent for getting a thin cut on raw meat for stir fry.. or just deboning a chicken. It is a very versitile knife. It is not very heavy though. If you are looking for a knife to cut through chicken bones and such.. use a cleaver. This Is a very very sharp versital tool that is just heavenly to use. It holds an edge very well.
3,Too light to be my workhorse chef's knife,"I have been wanting this knife for over a year... now that I have it, it stays in the drawer most of the time. As previous reviewers have stated, it is an amazingly sharp and precise slicer, great for getting almost anything paper thin. However, it just doesn't have the heft that I want for everyday chopping- onions, carrots, garlic, etc. It feels like a razor blade with a handle. I like it and I'm glad I have it- but for everyday use I reach for my Oxo Pro-MV 55 Chef's knife. At $30, you can't beat it- it was rated as the #1 chef's knife (tied with Wusthof Classic Chef's knife) by Cooks Illustrated. I can't find this particular Oxo on Amazon, however... note that the Pro-MV 55 line is more expensive but FAR superior to the ""good grips"" line from Oxo."
3,"Fast, fast knife","This knife is extremely sharp and has a very thin blade. This makes for a very fast knife - to the point of being dangerous. The blade's a little too thin and I've managed to cut myself twice - never had this problem with the Henckels. Otherwide it will make very quick work of cutting veggies, though its not very good for cutting meat. The hollow edge doesn't do much good for anything. If I had to do it again, I would probably get the 4-star Henckels Santoku."
4,A good soy sauce,"I use a lot of soy sauce in my kitchen. For one thing, I make a lot of stir fry dishes. And a little soy sauce tops things off nicely once the vegetables and chicken (or whatever) are done and once the fried rice is ready to go.For another, sometimes I like to eat left over fried rice by itself. Once again, some soy sauce added to the reheated rice is a delicious and simple snack.Kikkoman Soy Sauce, then, is a nice addition to one's pantry."
3,Wrong bottle type,"Although the quantity of soy sauce is the same, the bottle that I received was a restaurant-style table dispenser, not a bottle that can be closed. Because this will cause evaporation in my desert climate, the soy sauce must be transferred to another container. The photo should be updated to show the actual container."
5,Absolutely Delicious!,"Since I've been cutting back my budget and eating in instead of carryout, I've found myself craving my old favorites. One of them being Chinese food. Fried rice and pan-fried noodles have always been comfort foods for me and I found myself longing for them.Following my instincts, I made my first batch of fried rice using Kikkoman's, veggies and two eggs. The soy sauce was all I used other than a pinch of pepper and it was all that was needed. Kikkoman's is flavorful without being overly salty. (That's a lot coming from me being as I can't stand overly salty foods or condiments.) It's no where near as salty as those soy sauce condiment packets you get at the restaurants.I actually found myself adding more after the dish was done to add more flavor.I think the sauce is a tad pricey, so if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, great."
2,Gary,"I like Sir James Galway and I like Bach, but this CD is very average. I played it twice only the second time to confirm my first opinion that it was somewhat boring."
4,good for no-knead dough recipes,I am a fan of the no-knead bread dough that let the yeast do all the work. Such dough tends to be very wet & sticky. This product is excellent for use with such doughs for obvious reasons. Recommended.
4,This book is wonderful,"I first read this book my freshman year in high school, and I loved it. It is a great read for anyone between the ages of 8 and 15. I highly recommend the publishers to put it and its sequels--White House Autumn and Long Live the Queen--back into circulation."
1,Don't Bother,"This is an awful play. The dialogue is written in modern speech, although the setting remains in the early seventeenth century. The feminist treatment is heavy-handed, the humour isn't funny, and the pathos becomes bathos. As a piece for the theatre, it also suffers, with numerous overly-short scenes. I don't think this would translate well to the stage. Hell, it doesn't even scan well as a written piece.I am disappointed. The story of Elisabet Bathory is an interesting one, but becomes puerile and simplistic in this play."
5,An amusing two faced play,"This play beautifuly written about a sinister and ""un-happening"" town called Elderitch illuminates and shows how differen't it is from our society. This town is stuck in an atmosphere that is creepy and insincere. I am currently in the play and being two of the caracters, Lena and Mary. Acting out these two parts really shows the two differen't sides of one town. I love this play and would recomend it to anyone. This play is not for children, it is unforgiving and unseteling, and has some highly rated content and scenes."
1,What just happened?,"I'm a theater major and a junior in college. I am usually one who understands Shakespeare, Becket, etc. but this is something I didn't understand. It was painful to get through. While reading it I had to keep refering to the character listing in the beginning of the script, and when it was over I was left wondering what I just read. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Filtration is average for HOB filter; noise level is high,"I purchased this without doing much shopping around and I regret it. I'm running it in a 20 gal aquarium I recently pulled out of storage and am disappointed. The filtration is about average (and adequate for my tank) for this type of filter, but, compared to the two other hang on the back filters I've had this one is much too loud.It's the impeller and it makes a rattling noise. I've taken it out and cleaned it, and let it run for 48 hours, and then stopped it and reseated it, hoping to get it to quiet down, but to no avail. I've had it running for 4 days now and haven't even put any fish in because I don't want to stress them out from the noise and vibrations. I don't think I'll return it, but it's looking more like a waste of money every day."
2,LOUD!! LOUD!!! LOUD!!! LOUD!!!,"IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO PURCHASE THIS FOR YOUR BEDROOM PLEASE READ BEFORE DOING SO!!!OH MY GOODNESS!! This filter is super mega loud.It literally sounds like a little lawn mower.If you plan to purchase this for an aquarium in your bedroom, please don't.The product itself is good, I see that it cleans well, but JEEZ the noise is not worth it.If you plan to purchase this filter for anywhere in your house, besides your bedroom than that is a good idea.OH MY GOSH ITS SO LOUD, that I am losing concentration while writing this review."
4,Penguin 100 Bio-Wheel Aquarium Filter,"This is a great little filter for a smaller aquarium setup - less than 30 gallons, maybe 20 gallons. I have used these type of filters for years, starting back over a decade ago with an earlier model.This model is greatly improved, with a longer inlet that picks up more debris near the bottom of the tank. This is a huge plus!The bio-wheel function seems to be better implemented in this model as well, as it generally stays put and keeps moving. The old models would see a stuck bio-wheel commonly.I am currently using two of these filters - one I have had running over a year with zero issues, and the other for just a few months.I would highly recommend this filter. Please make sure to keep your filter media clean for best efficiency."
5,Works Great,"I'm using it on my 30 gal tank, No Noise, Pumps good, keeps the water clean and I'm really happy with this pump and it's alot better than my old one."
3,One for sale,"I'm rather pleased that so many people like these filters so much. I actually bought one somewhat influenced by the exuberance that many display when talking about them. But having already other types of filters, I have to say I'm not so pleased anymore in comparison. The Aqueon or the Tetra are a lot more fitted to my prefferences. The Penguin 100 has the pump on the outside, making it a little noisier. Also the filter has to be filed with water to start moving water unlike the other two types mentioned which only need to be pluged in. But the biggest problem I find with this Penguin filter is the fact that I can't use my own materials instead of the cartridges which are always too expensive. Aqueon media is so simple to replace and Tetra, a bigger model, is made with this idea in mind I believe. But if you don't mind buying cartridges and maybe a little more noise, not that much but noticeable, buy one. As a matter of fact, I'll sell mine."
2,Very disapointed,"I was very disapointed with this purchase. I had two many years ago on a marine 55gal. I am now running a 29 gal fresh and am pretty heavily stocked so I figured I use the old standby. This filter was extremely loud. Not water running loud but mechanical vibration loud. I leveled it, pulled the impeller out a few times to check for problems, nothing. After doing a little web research I found they pretty much just don't make them how they used to. I'd get the penguin 350, doesn't quite have the capacity but more liveable."
5,"Works well, Easy to clean","I've had this product for almost 1 year and it is still running. I clean it by hand once every six months. The filters are easy to replace, and so are the bio-wheels if you ever really needed to replace them. Comes with an extension extra that is not the most needed thing ever but is very helpful if you actually do need it."
4,Good filter,"I've had this filter for a year and it it is sturdy. I've had other filters and they break far too fast, such as the Aquaclear that I have (though that may be my fault, because I didn't clean it properly). this filter is actually more quiet than my aquaclear, but become a little louder after my last cleaning. I'm going to make sure I put it back together correctly (the intake is a little tricky to get back on). I have this and an aquaclear for 55g on my 55 gallon and this one won't be enough for crystal clear water on a 55g, esp with a few MESSY plecos, but it is definitely a great addition. I think that the bacterial growth that it provides really cuts down the nitrites. When my aquaclear kicks out all the time it keeps the aquarium from looking very bad. I give it a B+. It's not perfect, but it works really well."
1,Would not start for me,"The pump just bubbles. There is not a tight seal between the pump and the pipe. I tried for 90 minutes to get it to start. Had it going for about 10 seconds but it quit.Appears to be made of really cheap molded PVC. It's not expensive, but then again it does not work either.Also, it is extremely loud."
3,No hassle...............NOT true..........,"The product works ok..... but i had to call customer service 2 days after getting the product, because it stopped working! it happened to be that particles got caught in the flow valve and it needed to be cleaned.... i had to wait forever and they had no answer... when i asked if this would happen alot??!! Nor.. why did it happen only two days after getting the product..... i used to have two 30gal whisper filters in my tank (55 gal tank) for 2 years....now i tried something new and i have to clean it once a week!!!"
1,Did not receive,"Because of christmas shopping I was doing I forget I ordered this , I never received my package can u please look into this"
1,Terrible customer service,"I received this filter with a broken filter box. I tried to contact MarineLand via email and six days later had not heard back. During that time, during business hours, their customer service phone line said it was out of business hours, or if I did get through, wait times exceeded 30 minutes. Returning item at a loss of shipping charges to me (!!!) I'll never buy from this company again, no matter how good their products might be."
1,Crap.,"Has caused me nothing but trouble and the loss of a fish. I bought this filter for a 30 gallon gold fish tank, as what I thought would be an upgrade. With-in a month both of my large gold fish had ick, which eventually killed one of them. Since then I test my water very frequently and have found that even with a 50 percent water change I can not keep the nitrates at a safe level.The manufacture suggested that I change the filter media once a week, and do a 50 percent water change at the same time.I do not have the time or money for this filter. Will not be purchasing another Marineland product."
2,Loud!,"OMG it is loud! I installed it yesterday (9/10/12). The motor is out of balance some house. Marineland mentions it on their website, and provides a phone number. I'll call them today. :-("
2,Cheap,"Overall, I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. Its obvious Marineland is trying to cut cost by using lower quality materials. The sides of the housing aren't completely flat. The plastic is so cheap that it feels like the housing is buckling inwards. The motor is a lot noisier than I had hoped. It's noisy enough that I wouldn't recommend having it in the bedroom.I am a long time Magnum 350 and H.O.T. Magnum user. Those filters are a very good quality material. The only reason i got an Emperor was because I wanted a quick media change solution.I got this thing for around $30. It came from Petco via Amazon. Took about a week to arrive even though I'm a Prime member. All things considered, I got what I paid for. A cheap filter that does the job."
1,didnt fit my tank,i bought this filter to go into my MARINELAND 56 gallon tank. When I recieved it I found out that it wouldnt fit down into the tank like it was supposed to. Since I opened it and put it together before I measured i wasnt able to return it. So now it is sitting in my garage waiting to see if someone needs it.
2,Bio wheel is always stopping,"After the first month or so, the bio wheel would stop spinning - not just slow, but stop altogether. I was advised by store personnel and the Marineland hotline to clean the impeller, well and tube. I've done that several times with little change. The wheel would move a little, then stop. I've tried changing the filter frequently, still no effect. Should I change the impeller? I'm thinking of scrapping the unit and go with an Emperor 280 - it has two pumps, one for filtration and the other for the bio wheel."
2,Quality Control,"This pump has a manufacture defect with the right side bearing loose for the bio-wheel on the right side,causing the wheel not to rotate."
1,Junk x 2,"I bought the 400 and got is 2 days later. It was missing a bio wheel bearing. I called customer service and they are sending me one. At this point I had not plugged it in, when I did is was louder than the filter I'm replacing because it's really loud. I sent it back and got another today. No missing parts but holy crap it's loud. I called customer service for 3rd time, they offered to send new parts and would not promise it would fix it. Marineland needs to address these manufacturing defects in a way that let's me open a box and the product will work as advertised. If The replacement parts don't fix the problem, I'm stuck with a P.O.S. that is no good because they say the parts will be here in 2 weeks! I'm guessing longer...I'm sending it back and buying another brand.Emperor 400 Pro Series Bio-wheel Power Filter - Up to 90 gallon, Rite Size ""E"""
3,"first one bad, second one works",I set it up per mfg spec and it was very loud. Called customer service and they took 3 days to get back to me and they said to clean it! It's freeking NEW! I retured to to pet's mart and they exchanged it for another one. The new one was very quiet. Beware it might be so loud you cant sleep even with it on the other side of the house.
4,Works well for the money.,Can't go wrong for the money with the Penguin 350.Good flow rate. Did notice is got a little quieterafter a few weeks. But the flow rate also went downa little (not much). No free lunch.Much better product than Tetra Whisper series.Using this on a 60g tank along with 40g canister filter.I would give it a 4 1/2 stars. Does a great jobwith mechanical and chemical filtration. Using my 10year old Eheim canister filter handle Bio load. Bio-wheelsseem good.
1,Complete Garbage!!!,"I bought my first penguin 150 at a pet store for my 29 gallon freshwater tank. Less than six months later, the filter stopped working after I unplugged it to clean my aquarium. I tried numerous things to get it to restart (cleaned the propeller, intake, etc) and nothing worked. I couldn't let my fish go without a filter for another 24 hours so I went back to the pet store and bought another one hoping that it was just a freak incident. However, I am now in the same position that I was in before, with a non-functioning Penguin filter! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!Unless you're cool with spending money on something that is supposed to carry out a vital function for your fish, only to have it stop working several months later, do NOT waste your money!"
2,Not enough for a 50 gallon,"I thought this would be enough to handle my 50 gallon breeder tank, but I was dissapointed. It doesn't seem to be powerful enough to filter the whole tank. On another note... this thing is HUGE. I think I would have been much happier going up to the emperor 400.I noticed that a lot of times the water will simply go up and over the carbon filter and out. Instead of passing through it.Also, if you were looking for something quiet.. this is not it. Even with the water level very high it sounds like a mini waterfall."
3,"Decent, but heres a tip","I think this is an ok filter, it definitely does its job of providing chemical and mechanical filtration, but heres a tip.I do ALOT of work with fish tanks and supplies. One thing I have noticed from cleaning, fixing and modifying aquarium supplies is that in the last few years, maybe a little longer, marineland has started using cheaper parts.I have an older model of this filter and it has adjustable flow and a bit better construction. I liked it, so I bought a new one. The newer one is noticeably cheaper in construction and components, no flow control knob and after four months it periodically grinds and it is LOUD! I hear it across my decent sized home.So bottom line, it does its job as a filter, and in my opinion its a great filter. Just has a few things it could improve on."
1,Last a few months,"To start, the right bio-wheel never seated correctly and hasn't spun. Although it was brand new, I kept it anyway. Should have returned it! Within a few months, it has become LOUD. I will not buy this brand again."
1,emperor 400,"I read reviews for this product which was mix reviews. it was either really good or no good. I decided to order it on amazon. Turns out it was really really loud and noisy. I have a penguin 150 that still works like a champ. the quality of the emperor is really cheap. i called marineland what was going on and the sent me some parts, but still really loud.. Well didnt work for me.. would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Not bad overall,"The filter does a good job at keeping my tank clean. When I first got it, the impeller noise was ridiculous but now that things are seated its pretty quite.The biowheel has stopped spinning for long periods of time a lot lately, cleaning the entire filter has not helped. Also, I've had to hook a UPS up to it, since most of the time it will not prime itself after a power outage. Keep the water level all the way up to the 'slide' to keep water noise down."
2,Too loud for me,"I had a Marineland filter just like this a few years ago. I always thought it was a little loud. I was always under the impression that it was loud b/c it was old. Well, I recently bought this product and sent it right back when I heard the same sounds coming from it. I had this im my bedroom where I slept so I couldn't sleep with the inconsistant clicking/grinding sounds from the impeller (or whatever was making the noise).I tried purchasing one more from the local store just to see if I had some bad luck..but I got the same annoying sounds.So while I'm sure the biowheel works great, this product just didn't suit my needs. I now use the Aquaclear filters in all my tanks."
3,it burnt itself out after 10 minutes,i was so happy to get it thinking it was going to be a great filter for my tank but it stopped working after 10 minutes after i got it all set up :(
3,Good but not great,This filter is good for about a 30 gallon tank unless you have a 55 gallon and have very small fish in it. I used it for a 55 gallon tank with two Oscars the size of a iPhone. It could not keep up with the tank. I then ordered a second one thinking this would be over kill. WRONG !!! Finally I ordered the Fluval FX5. I have since put the FX5 on a 125 gallon tank with 4 Oscars now about the size of a K-2 football and it has no problem.
3,LOUD!,"This filters does a great job in cleaning a tank, with in 5 hours the water was crystal clean, and has remained so. I had to filters running prior to clean my tank. I only need one now. Downside, it's LOUD! very loud, I had to call the technical support for a replacement bio-wheel it was ripped (that arrived in 1 week). I'm going to call this week (1-14-2013) to address the noise, I wanted to give it several weeks to quiet down, it has a little, but not enough."
5,Marineland Penquin Power Filter,I use this in my fish tank to areate and keep the tank clean. This has served by purpose. I am very satisfied.
3,Ok item for a hob filter,Filter is noisy and changing filters is costly and messy. I would advise anyone needing this much filter to purchase a Canister filter.
5,Good Pump,We bought this one after our other was fried in a lightning storm. We like it. It was easy to put together and easy to use.
2,"Too Much, too little look elsewhere",I got this based on reviews on Amazon . I have to admit its a nicly built unit but its way too much for my 36 gal setup . The water out put is blowing My fish away . They stay clear of the corner of the tank where its hung . I am also not inpressed with its filtering . I have the tube extended fully down in the tank and I notice small particals of matter just get push around in my tank and not sucked up into the intake .Another thing is the filter box is HUGE ! I have a T5 HO 4x 31w light and it sits too tall so I cant move the light back where I need it . I would have to hang the light by chains if I continued to use this beastNo way to adjust the output of the filterSo I am rethinking my filtering needs and dumping this water blaster in favor if a Fluval F3 that does have adjustable output . I am reading many good things on the F3 on you tube
5,very good product,"this is my second one, this one from amazon was easy to order, and a better price. my fish live in a 20 gallon tank, that stays crystal clear. very good expierence-- as usual, with amazon!!"
1,crap,I've owned marineland 350 and 200 for over a year they work great. Got this one for a new 65 gal tank and it is super loud. The rattling driving me crazy i have done every trick in the book still super load. I guess i'll just get a aqua clear 70 in a few weeks and use this piece for a spare.
5,"great item, amazing price","marineland penguin 350 is the best filter i ever had, its great and quite and the price is great. i highly recommend this filter to all my friends."
4,pretty good,"for the price its a great filter! the only problem i have is when the filters build up with fish waste, it cuts the flow a bit and the biowheels stop spinning from lack of flow, which kills the beneficial bacteria. make sure to keep the device clean and change filters frequently to avoid any problems"
4,"Good filter, but can be a bit noisy",This is the second one I have owned. The first was really loud because of a vibration. I think it was defective though. The second one is much quieter and does a great job. It keeps the nitrogen cycle in full swing even after removing almost all of the water.
3,"Good filter, Very noisy","This filter does what it is suppose to do but that's where the good ends. It is very noisy, the wheels give off lots of noise and the way the water enters the tank creates even more. We have this unit in our living room and luckily the TV masks most of the sound. I used this to replace a very old Penguin 160, but I'm honestly thinking of putting that one back in and returning this as it made no noise at all (no Bio-Wheels). If it was anywhere near the bedroom we would not be able to sleep. Mostly it just a constant hum from the wheels spinning and the sound of water splashing like a small waterfall. Doesn't seem to matter which slots I put the filters in, the level of my water or how much I open the water intake, it always stays the same. Great filtration if it's somewhere you don't have to listen to it."
1,Don't buy this filter,This filter is so noisy. I am not happy with this product. I bought this filter because of good feedbacks. You will be sorry if you buy it.
5,Amazing,I have read before that this is a loud filter. I now own it and it is the quietest filter. The waterfall spout is closer to the water creating less of a trickle noise. You can hear a clock tick while this filter is cleaning your tank. pet solutions is the place to get it. ENJOY THE EMPEROR!!
4,Keeps up with all the waste from my turtles,"I have two tanks (90 and 75 gallons) and I use two of the Emperor 400 filters on each. If you've ever owned turtles, you know how nasty and dirty they are and how difficult it is to keep their tank clean. I have five turtles and they make a huge mess of their tank. These filters do an excellent job keeping the tank clean. I add extra media to the gray plastic inserts in addition to the rite size E filters. I have found these filters are worth the money. When I clean the filters I take all of the pieces apart and scrub out all the extra food and poop from the propeller and the other little gears. This helps the filter to run smoothly and quietly. It does produce a solid hum, but that is expected since it is powerful."
1,Marineland Emperor 280 power filter,"I ordered two Marineland Emperor 280 power filters to go on the back of my new 50 gal Cichlid tank. From day one, they were very noisy. I built a shelf to go over them to try to dampen the noise, which helped, but still: mechanical buzzing and overly loud water trickling. I cleaned the impeller, made sure there was nothing inside the housing, etc., all to no avail. Frustrated I went to the pet shop and purchased an AquaClear Power Filter (70) to install to see if it would be any quieter. It is almost dead silent! I am ecstatic! I have ordered another one to replace the other Marineland filter.The theory behind the Bio-Wheel is a good one, but the overall sound of this filter simply won't do for me. I"
5,GREAT UNIT,"I've been a fish hobbyist for over 20 years and have seen a lot equipment come and go. If you don't find this filter one of the best on the market, you should change hobbys. This is the easiest and most efficient filter you will ever find. As others have explained, you have to be smarter than the filter. Operate it the way it is suppose to operate and you will find it perfect. It will keep your tank very clean and healthy. I have 3 of them and love them.."
1,Too noisy,"This is the 3rd filter I've tried for my 15-gallon tank.The others being Whisper C and Marina S15.The Penguin 100 is the noisiest power filter I've had.There are two types of noise from this filter, the water splashing down from the wheel and the grinding noise from the impeller.The water splashing noise I can take, it's like a white noise in the background.The noise from the impeller is awful and there is no reason it's that loud. I read the instruction booklet and there is no suggestion in there to fix the noise.So after a day and half, I gave up and returned it."
4,Good Filter,"Filter works as advertised, removes a lot of crap out of your tank. It could be a little noisy sometimes but not to a level where it becomes annoying. The bio-wheel is a really nice feature. Would definitely recommend."
3,New model is noisy and lacks flow control,"Just bought an Emperor 400 and found out it is missing the flow control feature that previous models had. One of the biowheels was also warped during shipment, but I was able to fix that. However, compared to my Petco 65 filter, this is one noisy filter. I have tried everything, but cannot get the noise level down. It sounds like the impeller is rattling around. Since this aquarium sits in my living room, I will call Marineland customer service next week and have them ship me a replacement filter. If that does not fix it, I will return the unit.Emperor 400 Pro Series Bio-wheel Power Filter - Up to 90 gallon, Rite Size ""E"""
1,Penguin Needs To Redesign Their Impellers,"I had this power filter running in my 16 gallon saltwater reef tank for about a month, and the impeller shaft got scarred by debris and became extremely noisy. This exact same thing happened to my Penguin 660R powerhead after less than 3 months in the same tank. Let me tell you, this is not a dirty tank that should have these problems, it is a crystal-clear reef tank. Penguin products just are not made to last. Which is really lame, because Marineland also makes Emperor products, which last a lot longer and are much better designed. You get what you pay for in aquariums, and it's definitely worth putting out the money for a better powerhead or filter up front, so you don't have to pay more to replace the cheap product later on anyway.I replaced my Penguin Bio-Wheel with an Emperor 280 and now I have just ordered a Hydor Koralia Nano to replace my Penguin powerhead.Do yourself a favor and just buy a better product from the beginning."
2,restart problems,"I have been using the Marineland 200 Bio-wheel Filter on my 30 gallon tank for less than a year. It is supposed to be for up to a 50 gallon tank but it is barely powerful enough for my 30 gallon. A couple of months ago I started having restart problems with the filter. If power is disrupted to the tank, the filter is very hard to restart. The motor sounds like it is running, but it will not pull water into the filter. I doubt it will survive another power disruption. I am very disappointed that it did not even last for a year."
5,"Love, love, love it!","Best filter I have ever owned. Don't bother with other filters, this one has kept my 65 gallon tank the cleanest and with very little maintenance. A very happy customer!"
4,Good filter for FRESH water.,"This is a good filter for a small Fresh water tank. Despite being described as for fresh or salt water, I would not use this on a salt water tank. I used it on a salt water for some additional mechanical filtration and after 2 months took it out to clean it. The impeller snapped when I pulled it out of the housing. This impeller rod is metal as opposed to the ceramic used in other filters."
4,does the job,I use this in my 55 gallon tank. This is a good product and is very quiet. It keeps the water as clear as crystal and my fish are healthy
4,Good pump,This item is not the one I thought I was going to get but it seems to work good. Not quite as good as the one I actually wanted.
2,"Noisy, noisy, noisy","The Penguin 150 is an excellent filtration systems, better than the AquaClear I used for many years, but man, it is so noisy I'm going to have to take it down and put up with the AquaClear again. It's the first thing you hear when you come into my apartment and it just dominates everything. I can't believe that after all the years that this has been out that they still haven't found a quiet motor for it. Too bad, because it works fine. Don't they usability test these things? Geeze."
1,Died within 2.5 Months,"I ordered the Penguin 200 and was very impressed when I fired it up for my wife's 30 Gallon tank. It seemed powerful and kept the water pretty clear.Now to put it into perspective on why I bought it. We had a smaller Penguin (I believe it was a 150?) on this tank and it died, I could not find any replacements in my local stores so I ordered it from Amazon. Received it a couple days back in Nov 2010 and now it is also dead.Over the past 3 years we have had multiple Marineland Penguin power filters on our small tank and this larger tank and everyone of them has died within 5-6 months. They offer a 3 year warranty, but by the time I pay ship it back, I might aswell buy new, which I have to do anyway to keep the fish alive.Guess I've learned my lesson about these, these things are junk. Looking for another brand."
4,aquarium filter,"Works great. I have 3 of these in 2 aquariums. They can get tempramental at times when I do a water changeout, but overall they are quite and efficient."
3,fantastic while it works...,"This filter was fantastic while it worked. Rinsed the filters every now and then, and I could not have a better filter. However, we had a power outage for less then ten mtinutes, and it quit working after I had it only six months. It never turned on again after that. I cleaned every part of that filtration system. Big disappointment. When it works, its great, just dont count on long term."
5,Wonderful Product,"I bought this filter as part of the filtration for our 125 gallon fish tank. I love the biowheels, this one arrived quickly, primed easily and has been working like a champ. The only downside is the cartridges included are junk and broke down in both of the biowheels I've bought in about 2 weeks. So buy some extra, the replacement cartridges last MUCH longer!"
1,Powerful but very noisy,I bought the penguin 350 for my 40 gallon breeder African cichlid tank for the extra flow but this thing made all sorts of vibration noises. I took it apart to find that the impeller magnet was chipped in multiple places. So i returned it (Amazon has great customer service) and bought the aqueon quite flow 55/75 ...ive used them in the past and they are extremely quite for a HOB because the impeller motor is solid state and its in the tank water. Marineland has seemed to drop off on the quality over the years. At least my Marineland tank is still kicking it.....Knock on wood
5,Buy this filter!,"The Emperor filters are the best you can get in the whole power filter line, trust me. They have extra large filter cartridges, they have a extra large media container and the biowheel does an excellent job with biological filtration. These filters are also durable and dependable. They are well worth the money spent."
3,Not as good as they once were,I own 2 Emperor 400's that are about 8 years old. The are solid and don't make any noise. They also have adjustable outputs. The new model came with a warped top and the filter is noisy. I've tried adjusting the intake tube and impellor assembly but it's still rattling. And why did they remove the adjustable flow feature? That is great if you want to slowly filter water over special filter media or if you're feeding and you don't want all the food sucked up right away. Why can't companies leave good products alone?
3,Not bad,"I have been using a Biowheel 150 on my 29-gallon aquarium for well over a year, and find that for the price, it's an okay product. It keeps the aquarium clean, changing filter inserts (I put two in my unit) is easy, and haven't had any problems with the impeller. The only drawbacks I've seen with this particular power filter is the fact that, as one other reviewer stated, if the electricity happens to go out in the home, the filter doesn't always start up again on its own once the power comes back on. And I also find that unless the water level in the tank reaches the outflow part of the filter (which means the water level has to be at absolute maximum in the tank at all times), the filter is noisy...the sound of the water splashing into the tank from the filter is distracting. It's certainly not as quiet as some other filters I've used in the past, but for overall performance, it's not a bad product. I'd rate it at 3-1/2 stars if the option was available for half-stars. ;o)"
2,Poor shipping method,"Product arrived from Petco ---- Damaged ---- They did not place the package into another box for shipping. When it arrived, the overflow was cracked. I immediately called and they will be sending me a replacement (not here yet).I assume that the product is a good one, but I have not yet had the experience to plug it in."
1,marineland penguin power filter 50 to 70,"Really bad product, after 3 months of using it got really loud, feels like the pump will go bad, very loud, would not buy it again."
3,Does a great job of filtering but...,Does a great job of filtering but it is noisy. Wish I would have bought the Emperor 400 instead.
5,Good Filter,I already had one of those filters in another aquarium. It is a good filter. It was a reasonable price for the filter.
4,Great material for a Moz fan !!!,I didn't realize how good was this concert. I hardly recoment this VHS tape for a real Moz fan.
5,Great for violin makers!,"This book has the best drawings and photographs of the process of violin making that I have ever seen. Large format, good camera angle, good shadowing and lighting. I have been an amateur violin maker for a long time and I learned about a half a dozen new procedures or tool modifications right away. I highly recommend this book for aspiring violin makers."
5,THE ART OF VIOLIN MAKING,"I had to wait for the tenth reprint of this book. Well worth while. The reviews are correct [one by Yehudi Menuhin ] that this volume provides all the knowledge you would wish on Violin making.The articles on the original makers ,and todays makers complete the violin story. As a fiddler of 60yrs I am not going to build one , but I now know the correct configuration of sound post ,bridge etc . Inspired me to give a talk at our local ""Probus"" club on History of the violin.I have an Albani ,down the scale a bit but I love it."
3,Gail should hire an illustrator or a photographer !,"Ms. Gibbons is a WONDERFUL writer. Her drawings, however, are definitely not in the category of her writing. They detract from her books. I am a children's librarian and I have seen time after time that kids will avoid her books because the pictures are so unappealing. This is a shame since the text is usually outstanding. Ms. Gibbons should think about getting an illustrator or a photographer to supply an equivalent to her text. If she were to do this, her books would reach a much greater audience."
3,Great Movies horrible Artwork.,"The curse was sort of disturbing for me me in a strange way.I never got to see this movie until now.It was really hard to find on vhs,however the artwork was more appealing and better,as this one is not.As a collector i was dissapointed with its dual disc generic cover and packaging.mgm does not put out the best artwork on there dvd's hello mary lou prom night2 is a good example ,however i recommend this movie it is great and the effects were amazing."
3,My dvd's,This product was ok i might add. I purchased this item because i couldnt find it anywhere else. Everything seems to be ok with this product!
5,Delivered as promissed,"had 2 vintage receivers both with ""dead"" channels. Was able to clean the switches/dials and now both work great. Already recommend to my brother."
5,An important book about an important truth,"Beautifully written, this book hit me right in the heart. Exley tells the truth in simple, conversational, easy-to-digest prose. Truth is often simple, but hard to live. Thanks to Exley for taking my busy, distracted mind and focusing it on what is important. Read it. This book is important!"
4,Technical but digestable,"This book is a nice overview of electronic and computer music (as one might gather from the title.) It's great to sit near a computer and research some of the composers and pieces discussed, as many of them are on youtube and at least sound clips are available somewhere online. You're not going to learn how to program or compose from this book, but it's great for getting a decent background of what went on from 1890-1990."
5,Cow Crimes and the Mustang Menace - a great summer read,"In Cow Crimes and the Mustang Menace Ruby Taylor rides for the third time. Although she applies her remakable sleuthing skills and solves the mystery of local thefts, Ruby remains completely lost in how to proceed in her relationship with boyfriend Wesley. This is such a true depiction of real life where we can often help others but can't find our way out of a paperbag when it comes to our own lives. Ruby Taylor is smart, sassy, and fun to be around. This book will give you hours of rich summer reading."
2,Installed on 2004 F150 FX4. 5.4 trition engine,Did not change my horse power & fuel ecomy like I had hoped even after adding the silver bullet trottle spacer plate but it looks good
4,Breezy Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this book. It is a pleasant and thoughtful memoir of a close high school friendship and how for a time that takes almost complete hold of boy's life. It then traces through college and into adulthood how the relationship evolves as time and circumstances change. I think we all have had some measure of this experience and it is interesting, at least for me, to make that analogy to my life. I especially liked the author's writing. I found myself at times stopping and examining a phrase or analogy he used and admiring the literary construct. I haven't read any of Mr. Cohen's other two books but I plan to take a look at them now. A very nice book."
2,Form over Substance,"I received Lake Effect as a gift, as I, like Cohen, also attended New Trier High School in the early-mid 80's and the giver felt the book might interest me. Impressed as I was with Cohen's writing, I could never shake the feeling of how empty and shallow all of this was. And to glorify the excessive drinking and drug consumption served only to lower my esteem for Cohen and the famous ""Drew-licious"". Spoiled, self-absorbed and over indulgent, the characters reflect the worst of the North Shore and gives critics of the area plenty of material to work with.Not worth the time or money."
3,Greta Women Singers pf the 20th century Rosemary Clooney,Ok quality but not the best concert - very short
3,a film about teens and sex,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.À nos amours is about girl in her mid teens who is experimenting with sex and has numorous encounters with people. She gets into fights with her mother and brother constanly and her father moves out of the house.The film also has a soundtrack of a piece from Henry Purcell's ""King Arthur"" sung by Klaus Nomi.The release is a 2 disc setDisc 1 contains the film and the original theatrical trailer.Disc 2 contains an interview with director and actor Maurice Pialat, an interview with lead actress Sandrine Bonnaire, interviews with directors Catherine Breillat and Jean-Pierre Gorin, ""The Human Eye"" a documentary on the film, and actor auditions.This film has many scenes of male and female nudity and is for mature audiences."
1,"5 Star...kidding, right?","After about 20 minutes into this movie, you could tell the lack of acting, direction and story. I only picked it up because Criterion released it, and what a mistake.If you enjoy the trials and faults of a teenage girl, how badly acted here, but not as bad as the director himself, then maybe this ones for you.Couldn't even finish...beware!"
3,Common Sense approach to life,"A pretty basic book no doubt, but not too bad considering its simplicity. The author does get the reader to consider God in the simple things in life. In short, nothing that goes noticed is without meaning if one is paying attenion. Sound advice if you ask me."
4,Can't go wrong with this one.,"If you haven't read the series yet, by all means do so. Nothing could be written in a review to do justice for this masterpiece. If you already read the books and just want to own the series, I belive this is a good choice as well; all 10 books for [this price] is a steal. Only improvement I can think of for this Item, is I wish it was a Hardcover one."
2,Too heavy!,"While I enjoyed the story, this book is enormous (about the size/weight of a dictionary). This was just too big and heavy for me to comfortably carry with me, or to read in bed. I ended up quitting after reading the first book out of 10."
2,"First half was a good read, but the last half wasn't finished.","The first half was good, not great. It's very dated fantasy. Too much of the story felt like it was stretched to get more books to sell. Couldn't even finish the last quarter of the book."
2,Unique but lackluster in delivery and form.,"True to form, the Hugo and Nebula awards have again gone to an author whose work is very unique and enticing in its world construction and characters, but is somewhat lacking in literary form and character development. With his style reminiscent of the beatnick writings which inspired his generation, Zelazney builds many versions of the same irreverant character facing the same bewildering challenges which seem to be presented solutions from nothingness at the proper convenient moment.Lovers of such works as Ender's Game, Sword of Truth(s), and such like novels will thoroughly enjoy this work, while those who prefer more sophisticated character development and less contrived solutions to the protagonist's problems will find this work very plodding and well... annoying."
3,Imperfect fantasy,"There are many for whom Amber is the be all and end all of modern fantasy. I am not one of them. Personally I find the ""science"" of Amber cumbersome and the narration mechanical and contrived. You can find entertainment in this series -- but for me it rings a little hollow. Better than this in the genre would be Moorcock's Elric books."
4,First half is great!,"Excellent series. The idea behind the ""shadows"" is very clever. Combine that with Zelazny's distinctive writing style and the result is a superior reading experience. Corwin is a fantastic character with flaws and desires that all can empathize with.Books 1 through 5 are fantastic. Unfortunately, in books 6 through 10 the plot becomes wilder, more occult, have a less logical flow of ideas, and generally doesn't succeed in emulating that rich, mystical quality of the first five. Still, this is a must read series for anyone interested in fantasy. I'll never forget reading the fantastic beginning chapters of Book 1."
5,A unique series. Clearly the best fantasy series ever,"I could say that the first novel of this 10 part series is a truely unique framework plot, and that both the first and second set of 5 books end in a cliffhanger. But see the other reviews for a synopsis of this series. The strength of this collection of books is the study of the character and personal growth, and increasing humanity of both Corwin and then his son Merlin. If they are the archetypes of mankind, and the premise of this book is that they are, it can't help but make the reader feel a little more noble, a little more heroic, and a little more hopeful.Zelazny was an artist unparalleled in the world of fantasy, and this collection is an incredibly great read. I've read it multiple times, and I look forward to reading it again in a few years."
5,Fantasy with a touch of Machiavelli,"Roger Zelazny's Amber Series is perhaps the most evocative and brilliant fantasy series ever written--right up there with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, but much darker. If you like your fantasy with a nasty touch of Machiavellian politics, this series is for you. And now that the complete set is bound in one volume, you won't even have to pause to get the next book: you'll just be able to jump from one superb story to the next.All of the fantasies have to do with the royal family in a parallel universe of Amber. While not set in a time long, long ago these books do have a nice balance of modern mentalities, magic, and old world touches (swords, capes, etc.) I think that there is something for everyone in the Amber series: strong male characters, strong female characters, and marvelous settings."
5,good collection,"It's great to have the entire series gathered under one cover, but be warned--the book itself is huge! You'll want to prop it up on something to read it. And you probably won't be reading it in the tub."
4,What's not to love?,"Roger Zelazny is unique in implementation of a style, written as if it were being spoken while you read the page Roger Zelazny gives life to Amber, and subsequently in the second half to the Courts of Chaos. The thing with Roger Zelazny's works regardless of whatever book you pick up is you have to be able to read between the lines. There is a plot withibn a plot within a plot in all the Amber novels. Are their unanswered questions? sure - that is part of Amber's charm is teh unanswered question. I can only give it 4 stars because of the horrid implementation of what could have been a master work"
3,This copy not the best,"Chronicles of Amber is, of course, amazing. A story you're not likely to forget. I remember where I was, reading it for the first and second times. If you're looking for an escape into fantasy this is well worth your time.This particular copy however, the soft-cover ""great book of Amber"", is unwieldy and difficult to hold comfortably no matter what position you're in. That may be fine, but it has so many typographical errors that I found it quite distracting; it pulled me out of the story every time a word was omitted or ridiculously misspelled or split in half inexplicably. You're much better off picking up the novels in their separate copies. I can't wait until they come to the Kindle! I'll buy it for me, my husband, my mother, and my friends too!"
4,Amazing Stories and Highly Recommended but .....,"Just a short note since anything I might add would be redundant, but this is a great book and I can hardly believe that it would not appeal to almost anyone BUT I had to read it in spurts because the plots and sub plots and backstabbing subplots tend to tire me as a reader. I can see why reading this as separate novels would be somewhat appealing but to have it all in one edition is hard to beat. I give it 4 starts ONLY because it tires the reader (IMHO) to try to keep up with who can be trusted and who was trustworthy last week but cannot be trusted today (that really gets tiring) but a lesser talent could never have pulled it off at all so just realize unless you are a unique individual you probably will take this in pieces but still be glad you bought this masterpiece."
5,Absolutely brilliant fantasy,"Cloaked in a world of great fantasy, Zelazny has created a great series of mysteries. You cannot help but be drawn into the confusion as you, along with the protagonist, try to discover the motives of dozens of intriguing characters and how all of those create the intense intrigue that surrounds mystical Amber. An intellectual delight in addition to being an engrossing read."
5,All this greatness in just one place!,"Zelazny's Amber books are rich, well thought out character studies under fantastic situations. From the first page, your sucked in, not understanding whats going on, nothing is spoonfed to the reader, you get to discover the world along with Corwin (later Merlin) it's a very engrossing style that used to really irk me when I finished a book and had to wait for the next one to be published, now, just turn the page... not even a need to go to the shelf.... how grand! Now I can keep my old paperbacks out of fondness but without the need to abuse them with my reading in bed and whatnot.... Without a doubt, my favorite series of books...Theres a lot of life lessons about loyalty, friendship, trust and distrust to make this a great book to give someone you know who is in the proper frame of mind, In fact, i know a 13 year old who just discovered Ray Bradbury... so i think I'm gonna slip him this anthology, and later a little early Harlan Ellison."
5,Best book ever to come!,This book is great! It is made up of all ten books in the two series whitch are connected to make a great long and exciting story. I gave it a 5 because they didn't have 6.
5,Best Vacation I Ever Had...,"was in Amber. Yes, I skip the shadow walks, and actually my crush is on Dara, Benedict's daughter with the Hellmaid. This is how immersive these books are! Every couple of years I take a vacation to Amber... good friends, I end up liking Julian at the end, I wish I was as cool as Corwin ( no one is, ya know!)... get these books now! Now! NOW!"
1,"Not that exciting, considering all of the other great fantasy books to chose from","This falls way short of Mistborn Trilogy and this author's other great fantasy books (Brandon Sanderson I think), every Fiest Novel is better reads and I've ready over a dozen, and Name of the Wind are all WAY better and more fun to read. This Amber stuff was very slow, dull, and border line boring to read in comparison. Yes, it is a new concept to be able to travel back-and-forth from 'real time earth' to/from fantasy Amber, moving through shadows and the physics involved. But overall pretty dull story. I only made it through the first 5 or 6 books, the first half... it stopped clean, solid ending, but then it started all over again with the kids, born from the hero's in the first 5 or 6 books. I couldn't take the same crappy story all over again with the kids, so I didn't even bother continuing any further."
1,A boring pulpy grind,"I purchased this full set after stumbling onto the ""Guns of Avalon"" which I liked. Having all these books together exposes just how bad a writer Zelazny is. I think if I read these individually over a period of years I wouldn't think they suck but one after another they just wore me down. The constant inner monologue is just so tiring not to mention the pages of ""walking through shadow"". It got to the point where I was skipping whole pages when I could see they had no dialogue. By the end I wanted to chuck the book in the wood stove. Maybe if they had been split into Corwin/Merlin books it would have been better. The second half was definitely more of a suck fest."
1,Kindle Users are banned,"OK Amazon sells this, but there is no Kindle edition. What gives? When the editor and author gets on track with the modern world, maybe they'll get a decent review"
2,Disappointing,"Each book is progressively less and less interesting. The end is not at all satisfying. I can't believe it took him so long to write all this. The first person perspective gets old and then the author takes over as another character in first person.While there are some interesting concepts in the book, overall I'd have to say, ""pass""."
5,Science Fiction at its BEST!,"Roger Zelazny's Great Book of Amber is a must read for any science fiction fan. This is the most imaginative work I have ever read! I have read this book 4 times and I know I will read it again and again. The first time I read it I knew nothing of the plot (no story description on the back). I borrowed it from a friend who said he had read it three times. I loved discovering the existance of Amber with Corwin. Until I finished the story the first time, there was no TV, no radio and certainly no other books until the last page was read. If your thinking of buying this book, think no more just get it, you will not regret the purchase!"
4,Books 1-5,"(Note: My copy only has the first 5 books of the Amber Chronicles.)I have always had a fascination with the idea of an infinite number of dimensions, or as Zelazny terms it shadows, so when I saw The Chronicles of Amber I was intrigued. I enjoyed the book very much and found the plot to be sufficiently original and not as black and white as so many fantasy novels are. There were enough twists and turns to keep me interested and the characters were not simply good or evil. I like books that are somewhat more reflective of actual human personalities and don't have goody goody heroes and absolute evil villains. The one criticism that I do have of the book is that Zelazny had a tendancy to be a little bit wordy in some sections particularly those that attempted to describe the shifting of shadows that Corwin did during his hellrides. Multiple pages of sentence fragments just gets somewhat tiresome after awhile. Other than that this book was thouroughly enjoyable."
3,Gradually getting worse...,"I liked the first 4 books (Nine Princes of Amber, The Guns of Avalon, Sign of the Unicorn and THe Hand of Oberon), although the descriptions of the travels through Shadow are utterly boring.But from then on books 5 thru 10 (The Courts of Chaos, Trumps of Doom, Blood of Amber, Sign of Chaos, Knight of Shadows and Prince of Chaos) the story becomes less and less credible (even for SciFi terms) and chaotic (probably because more and more Chaos persons appear) and sometimes completely boring."
4,Enchanting and habit forming,"I'm not sure why I didn't LOVE LOVE LOVE the Amber Chronicles to a five star degree, but I didn't. I thought this was a wonderful world and an excellent flawed hero, and I greatly enjoyed the plot twists and family relations. It seemed though that I was reading a slight shadow of a book. I have stayed up for three nights trying to finish this, so the series if definitely enthralling. Good adventure. Good read."
5,Back to read it again,"To make this short and sweet..... I read the first five books in 1982, and have never forgotten how much I enjoyed them... and now, 25 yrs later... I just ordered the Complete Chronicles to do it all over again., And I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much now, as I did then....The Chronicles Of Amber are probably the best story I have ever read..."
5,The Complete Amber Chronicles (at last!),"If I found this book earlier, it would have saved me a lot of money."
3,"Great story, Horrible edtion.","If you are looking at buying this collection, then you already know and love the Amber series of novels. They get 5 stars.This edition, however, is trash. typesetting errors, no end pages, poor quality paper, no table of contents. A real piece of trash. 1 star.Averages out to 3 stars, but that is still too high. Buy the novels individually and suffer the impact to your wallet and shelf space. You will be much happier."
3,its not the complete amber,"ok, so you have four excellent books that start if off, one mediocre book (I think that Courts of Chaos could have been better), then five books that aren't as good as the originals, but still pretty damn good. Lord of Chaos was the place that Roger Zelazny left the series at while taking a break, but then he came back and wrote five excellent short stories (even though they would be considered a full book if they were published together) that lead up to what would ultimately be the conclusion. While they do have a cliffhanger ending, it is better than the ending to Lord of Chaos with the main conflict of the Merlin Chronicles unresolved. You can search for them on the internet (I've got them all on my computer, downloaded them off the Gnutella network). Here are the titles, in the order that they should be read in:The Salesman's TaleThe Shroudling and the GuiselComing to a CordBlue Horse, Dancing MountainsHall of Mirrors"
3,Comments on the edition,"I love the series, but plenty of other people have said that. Let me say a couple of things about this omnibus paperback edition containing both the first and second Chronicles of Amber.1. The cover art is uninspired and weird. It doesn't map at all well with the textual description of Amber.2. It's too damn big. Why not print each Chronicle in its own 400+ page paperback.3. There are a fair number of typos and they obviously come from scanning and optical character recognition errors.Other than that, reading this book was like catching up to an old friend and I appreciate that it's in paperback again, even if the choices made by the company producing it were lousy."
4,awesome,"Just what I ordered in great time,and in good shape.I have always had great service,and would recommend to others.A refreshing tale(s) for those who just can't get through G.R.R.M's last book!His writing style is quick-paced and with this book, you won't have to go chasing down each volume!!"
5,Recommended by a professional,"This was a specifically requested gift for a woman who was working on her PhD. She used it to help her with her research. Now she's got her PhD, so it worked."
2,master locl #377Dat,"This is a great bilt lock but it will not fit on trailers that have a rolled up metal lip on the receiver, such as Well Cargo"
2,not secure,"i own 2 trailers. first i bought one of these lock and find them to be ok. I feel that a couple of big hammer hit can remove them from the hitch, but will need work. So for the price i tought it's was ok.Then, i bought a second one, at another store, on the other end of the city. i put it on my other trailer, put the key with the key of the others lock and leave this there for a week.After a week i did obviouly forget to identify my key. SO i had to try it. ok key 1 in lock 1, woking cool. key 2 in lock 2, working... good i tought i was lucky. then i try key 2 in lock 1 working ? then key 1 with lock 2.... working ?!?2 key with different tooth pattern work in booth my locks. what kind of lock is that. I finally endend removing these and i did put 2 DT security lock that do a much better job.Bottom line. Buy something else. Anyone with a lock like this one can use hes key to open your lock."
3,"Not great, not horrible.","The lock started to rust after only a couple of days outside. Overall the lock does not fit very well, it doesn't fall off, but for a 2"" coupler it could fit better than it does. I honestly expected a better product than what I got."
1,Buy something better,Had the lock for two years. Then one night they stuck a screw driver in the key area and banked it out with a hammer and stole my whole trailer. Only thing left was the key area they left behind.
2,Have to get a new lock,"I am looking for a new trailer hitch lock. I had the ""Master lock universal couple lock"" but someone broke the front half of the lock off and consequently the ball fell right out. Luckly I found my boat still there but the lock was in two pieces on the ground by the front my trailer by the hitch. The lock is made of cast metel and it looks like it didn't take much to break the lock because cast metel is brittle. One good whack this lock is no longer a lock. It did give me piece of mind for a lot of years. I'm sure it kept alot of honest people from stealing but I am now on the hunt for a better lock.Master Lock Universal Coupler Lock"
4,Excellent Quality - too bad it didn't fit.,"I purchased this lock for the hitch on my horse trailer. Unfortunately it did not fit, however the quality of the lock was excellent and I like the concept of how it works. I couldn't use it so I had to send it back which was also a pleasant process, so even though the product did not work for my specific needs it was all around a good expereience ordering from Amazon."
4,"Good, buzzes","First let me say the item came in a box the box and the light did not look like they had been used before, but the light and reel had scuff marks on it. Since it went up in my garage I wasn't worried but may be an issue with the packaging or manufacturing in some way.The product is what it says it is and as pictured. Had to leave out a star; I understand it is a fluoresent light but I didn't expect the buzzing to be noticeable like it is, nor that it would get warm to the touch (the handle not the light area)."
4,Decent Buy,"This work light is a decent buy and many more pros than cons.Pros: sturdy metal housing, outlet on the light is convenient, the hook and magnet come in handy hanging the light in difficult posistion, light is plenty bright and it has not broke after 20+ hours of use.Cons: If the cord at the base of the light is at the wrong angle, the light cuts outs. Just have to readjust the cord a little and works fine. Also the light gets a little warm after prolonged times of use.Overall, I would recommend this work light."
3,Bayco SL825,"The drop light was delivered fast. I hooked up the light and turned it on to test. All it did was flicker on and off if I moved it around. (Hmm... defeats a drop light purpose) Luckily I have worked with many of these lights and had a good idea what the problem was. So, instead of going through the return process to get another one doing the same thing I fixed it myself. Now it has been working fine.Bayco a little better QC please or drop the price..."
3,heavy,"I had no idea how bulky this light would be...I'm sure it's a good product, but just too much for me...need something with less cable, etc."
5,The perfect garage light,It's well worth the money! For many years I battled the old incandescent bulb light with an aluminum reflector--what an improvement this is~~~ you will not be sorry if you bight the bullet and reward yourself.
5,Work Light,These were brought as an XMAS for a garage mechanic and his shop. They are sturdy and offer excellent light for working on cars and trucks.
1,forgiven and set free,"I was very disappointed that there was so little information in this ""book"" (pamphlet). There were about 5 pages of input, all together, scattered throughout the book and all the rest is a workbook where you answer questions. I was hoping for some real insight. I got a workbook that is best done with a group."
4,This is a good one,"I am only about half way through this book with a study group, but I can tell you already it has helped me come to terms with some things I just couldn't face. It is good to do this with a group if at all possible because you'll find out you're not the only one dealing with this ...and other perspectives are very helpful. I am very encouraged that by the end of this book, I will be ready to move past this dark area of my life and be free to be who God made me to be... and maybe even help others too."
5,A Humorous and Practical Guide,"I spend way too much time reading books about writing rather than writing. But this book stands out from the dozens of books I've read over 20 years. What impresses me the most is this: It has specific suggestions on the process of incubating ideas, selecting the best ones, and developing those ideas.As with many books on writing, it offers pep talks and suggestions on technique. But the one thing I found in this that I've not seen in other books is what I've noted above. I believe it will help me move forward to finishing some projects I've had sitting around here for ages."
2,Smells like bathroom cleaner,Read the great reviews and purchased on that alone...NEVER AGAIN! Not bad as an air freshener but as a skin fragrance...YUCK!
1,Best to avoid this one . . .,"This book's presentation is difficult if not impossible to understand. The algorithmics are simply lost amid highly dense, nearly incomprehensible symbolism that obscures rather than illuminates ideas. As a result, the book requires tremendous effort to move from page to page. It will therefore be of limited or no use to practicing software professionals. Although the price is right, I cannot recommend this book."
1,Terrible,"""Of limited or no use"" is really all that needs to be said about this book. My greatest joy all semester was filling this book with every sardonic comment my professor could come up with to describe the utility of this author's research."
1,Big disappointment!!! Waste of time and money!!!,"The movie ""Roll Bounce"" has close to thirty songs playing though out it. So why does this lame soundtrack have less than half of those songs on it? What happened to KC & The Sunshine Band?, Donna Summer?, The Ohio Players?, Sister Sledge?, The Commordores?, Samantha Sang?, Heart? and a host of other artists heard in the film but nowhere to be found on the soundtrack!!!"
1,Disgusted,"I was appalled that they would even make such a horrible soundtrack that didn't even do justice to the movie or the original songs. These new artist remakes need to quit playin! I am a serious old school fan and the original songs in the movie took me way back and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I was so excited to buy the movie with the soundtrack attached and when I listened to it, I was disgusted. I am also glad to see that your other viewers feel the same as I. If a soundtrack is made it should contain the original songs. If not, then at least try to make them sound good. I repeat, do not buy this soundtrack!!!"
1,Not Good,"Since the movie was so good, you'd think the soundtrack would be too, right? Wrong! Dead wrong!Though I wasn't born in the 70s, I've heard plenty of music from that time (we pretty much play all of that, and then some in my house). My parents pretty much stick to the oldies, unless we make them hear something new that sounds like a throwback (like Alicia Keys, for example).My mom went to go pick up the soundtrack, thinking it was gonna sound like most of the tracks in the movie. She was mad that it was mostly remakes, and then demanded me to download all the songs off the movie and called it the ""authentic soundtrack.""I do agree with another reviewer though--you were better off listing the songs from the movie and getting iTunes or LimeWire to get the songs you heard, because with the exception of some of the original songs on this CD, the rest are remakes.If you're gonna re-create the mood of the 70s through a movie, at least have the music to go along with it!"
1,WTF? Where Are The Originals?!!!!,"This isn't Joseph. I am his oldest DAUGHTER.This is a RIP-OFF. We need the REAL versions of songs. The only two songs worth listening to are Chic's ""Le Freak"" and Foxy ""Get Off"".My question's are: Where's KC and the Sunshine Band's ""Boogie Man?"" Where's ""Flashlight""?This is a seriously disappointing soundtrack. They need to release the REAL version and stop trying to promote artists from this one.- A Really ANGRY Roll Bounce Fan"
2,Roll Bounce,"I thought the soundtrack would have more of the actual songs that were featured in the movie, like greatest dancer by Sister Sledge. Also I would have preferred to here the original artists of the songs."
1,Sad Sad Sad,"Many, many thanks to the French guy for posting the songs and original artists. I just finfished watching the movie and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, being 33 years old! It made me want to find my old skates and lace 'em up and zoom around my block at 12:30am! ha ha... What a disappointment to look up the soundtrack and see how lame it is with all the remakes and so few of the great songs from the movie! I will be downloading the songs for sure."
1,this CD... stinks,"My husband wanted to get this after watching the movie as they used all sorts of good songs to work out with, however, this CD doesn't include the best songs and it is lousy. Don't buy it ...or better yet buy mine as we sure don't want it!"
1,absolutely disgraceful bait and switch,"I feel really sorry for the people who LOVED the movie, as I did, and were all pumped to order an album of nostalgic trax that many of us grew up on.So, what kind of back-room media deal put these faux-funk flunkies onto a movie soundtrack that didn't even feature most of the artists recorded onto this lame frisbee?This is the kind of c***p that makes people want to bypass record companies entirely.Disgraceful.Good luck to all you fine brothas and sistas lookin' for the real deal. You'll find the trax. Just take a little time is all....."
1,Terrible Songs,"CD was in great condition, but all the songs on the CD were remakes of the old songs. I wanted the original 1970's songs they played in the movie. I was really disappointed and never play the CD."
3,Just Okay,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought the CD. I had been wanting the soundtrack assuming it would be most of the music from the movie and boy was I surprised to hear more remakes than originals that are tolerable to say the least. Not completely unhappy, but wish that I had looked a little closer before purchasing this one."
2,Disappointing,I was so anxious to recieve this soundtrack. The music from the movie was awsome. But the CD fell short of being what I had hoped for. The songs were not original. And alot of the music wasn't included on the CD. I guess I should have looked closer. So I will just buy the DVD. And listen to the music.
3,A little dissappointed,"Some of the songs on here were remixed differently than in the movie which was a little dissapointing for me. The reason I ordered the soundtrack was for the actual music in the movie, not a different version (ie. Boogie Oogie Oogie)"
1,Classic 1970s R&B Songs Butchered - ZERO STARS,"I have never listened to this soundtrack and I never will. Not in a million years. Who wants to listen to lousy unnecessary covers of classic songs? Who the he11 told Brooke Valentine she could remake ""Boogie Oogie Oogie""? And who is Brook Valentine anyway? Whatever! This is the reason why people download- they're tired of the unoriginality. Thank goodness I have all of the original songs at home on CDs and MP3. I wouldn't waste one red cent on ""Roll Bounce""- not even if it was on sale for .99 cents at the used CD store. Anyone who buys and actually likes it must have something seriously wrong with them. The ""Roll Bounce"" soundtrack is not worth it at all- get the songs by the original artists."
2,Roll Bounce,I wish I would've taken the other reviews to heart. Let me break it down for you...the songs on the CD are not the songs you hear in the movie. Commonly referred to as bait and switch. Brilliant concept..lousy execution.
1,mostly Horrible,"Horrible cd to a WONDERFUL movie. Give me the original versions any day. The one star is for Chic and a couple other originals. If not for them, it would be ZERO stars."
1,Disappointed,I am glad to see that I am not the only one who is disappointed with this soundtrack. I had expected to hear the original tunes heard in the movie. Instead it's a few originals with the rest being updated remakes from artists that weren't even born in the 70's!. Most unfortunate!!!!
1,Zero Stars would be a better rating it blows chunks,"Malcolm Lee does a great period movie and then he (or the studio) releases this tripe of a soundtrack with only 6 orginal songs and the rest are third- rate covers. Don't get me wrong I may be 40 and don't fit the target demograhpic (12- 20) they are trying to reach, but I will be going to Real Player and download a ""proper"" soundtrack with the orginal songs from the movie. sad, sad, sad."
4,NOT a Layman's guide to the Anthropic Cosmological Principle,"Although this is a very extensive book, covering the Anthropic Cosmological Principle (which in short focuses on the fact that so many aspects of the cosmos and nature are finely tuned to make life possible) in a historical perspective, within cosmology, quantum theory, chemistry and biology, it is definitely not a book for the Layman. It includes a lot of mathematics, which I think should have been included in the references at the end of each chapter. However, when you filter those passages out, and focus on the main points, this book is a must-have and a classic for everyone with an open mind and interest in our place in this universe.Rob (The Netherlands)"
5,Great.,"I thought this book was one of the best, I have ever read. The first part is pretty slow but later as you keep going you realise how the argument is progressing. I went over his calculations, and I could not fault the writers' conclusions.If you think how much effect mankind has just been civilised on the world in 6000 years and then that in a relative short period in cosmological terms, measured in millions of years, he will colonise the whole galaxy. This brings up two questions. The first is why has no other SETI race done it and two what effects will mankind have in the future development of the cosmos.It's definitely a book to make you think."
5,A classic,"A Classic. Much has been written on this subject and the idea, as well as its criticisms, has undergone a fast evolution. However, this book still holds its own."
5,Modern cosmology.,A great book about the modern scientific theories on the origin and functioning of the universe.
1,The book is a sad excuse for a popular science book,"A long time ago, I received this book as a gift. I started reading it but quit towards the beginning. It's so rediculously inaccurate. It's quite obvious that the writers know nothing about physics. Apparently most of the readers, including the others who posted reviews right here, are so woefully ignorant of science themselves that they could sail through the book without noticing this.Besides the the whole idea of ""The Anthropic Principle"" has a flawed premise. Read my article on it for Suite 101."
4,Fighting the World,"The album title pretty much says it all. Manowar is as you expect them to be, on this album too. Not that there is anything wrong with that, they are convincing in their attitude.Fighting the World is far from Manowars best album, it is a bit too produced for my taste and the songwriting seems uneven at times. Violence and Bloodshed for example I could easily have done without. But the album also contains some very strong tracks, like the amazing power-balad Defender, narrated by Orson Welles. Some people may argue that Manowars balads fall flat, I never shared that view. Holy War is a traditional Manowar song, and should have become a classic, although it seems somewhat forgotten to me. The last track Blackwind, Fire and Steel is an amazing and powerful speed attack.All in all not their best effort, but still a good one."
4,"Other bands play, Manowar kills!!","let's face it, this is't their best album (kings of metal is their best) but it is a good album nevertheless. songs like: ""defender"", ""blow your speakers"" and ""holy wars"" just rule!! unlike their later albums (louder then hell) the lead singer actually uses his voice and reach very high tones, which make songs like the above great. I didn't like it at first but after a few times I began loving it. buy it, trust me. Other bands play, Manowar kills!!!"
4,Gotta love it,"Manowar is as cheesey as it gets, but you have to love this album. It is so fun to listen to while chuggin' brews. Carry on and Defender are the standout tracks."
2,Fighting themselves,"MANOWAR is a classic example of a talented band being held down by their own misgivings annd mistakes. Trying so hard do establish themselves as ""THE KINGS OF TRUE METAL"", or something like that, and making utterly ridiculous cover arts like the one here, they ""scared"" a lot of metal fans who don't like to buy albuns with ""macho"" men with their nude torsos..."
3,Go figure...,"Well, if these guys dressed in ""macho"" clothes can still manage to be called by some fans as ""GODS"", I guess anything is possible in this world.... Musically, FIGHTING THE WORLD is about MAnwoar's first record for a major label and, accordingly, clearly worried about releasing some single / MTV material (CARRY ON, mainly). The overall production is slicker and cleaner, but even so the band accomplished a good and solid metal album. My favourite track is BLACK WIND FIRE AND STEEL, and the majestic DEFENDER."
2,Everybody expected something better,"After having recorded four records of outstanding epic music Manowar returned with an album that was a sheer mediocrity. Of course there still exist songs like Holy War and Black Wind Fire And Steel and the masterpiece Defender, but the rest of the songs don't have the required quality."
2,Ok album,"Bought this title because I lost it and only found to like about 4-5 songs on it but wasn't embarrassed to listen to it like some other manowar titles I recently bought -into glory,louder than hell and sign of hammer"
4,Rocking,"Manowar's ""Fighting The World"" probably isn't the best power metal out there but this CD is more of a melodic hard rock. It's got more of a mainstream 80s rock sound to it, but they maintain the edge that they're known for - harsh melodic vocal, and power metal like chops to their sound and Eric's screams. Sometimes these guys are just so cheesy, it's funny. I'd recommend ""Kings Of Metal"" over this one though. 4 stars."
3,Its so immature but nice music,Guys im 31 i cant listen seriously this album. This album is good if you are 15 not 31 . The lyrics make you laugh the attitude is really very ridiculous . But i have to say that the music in most parts is good .Blow your speakers and Defender have great music. If you are under 18 you will love this album.
3,Average,"Throught Manowar's own standards, set up by theirselves, this is only an average album. ""Defender"" is very good. ""Carry On"" is pure FM-radio orientated, ""Black WInd FIre & Steel"" is good. The rest is below the capacity of Ross the Boss and his fellows."
2,Fighting themselves,"MANOWAR is a classic example of a talented band being held down by their own misgivings annd mistakes. Trying so hard do establish themselves as ""THE KINGS OF TURE METAL"", or something like that, and making utterly ridiculous cover arts like the one here, they ""scared"" a lot of metal fans who don't like to buy albuns with ""macho"" men with their nude torsos..."
3,The Sell out,a lot of people will disagree with me but this album was not very good. i think Manowar are doing poppy songs and this was the beginning of the end!
1,Quite possibly the stupidest CD ever,"Are we really supposed to take this seriously? I mean, my god, listen to it! It sounds like it was written by 8th graders that get picked on because they like The Hobbit a little too much. Everytime I listen to this, this, thing they call an album, I burst out laughing. Holy War is probably the stupidest of the lot(The singer screaming ""Holllayy!!"" before a guitar solo sets me into fits of laughter every time I hear it.), but they are all quite bad. This album is a step up from ""Kings of Metal"", both of which I have the severe misfortune of owning, but they should both not be owned by anyone. If you're reading these customer reviews trying to decide wether or not to buy this CD, do yourself a favor and check out Iced Earth, Rush, Iron Maiden, or Bruce Dickinson. All of them play epic hard rock/metal, and unlike Manowar, they play it right."
1,Not satisfied,This is the worst form of Mahjongg that I have ever played. The tiles are not clearly delineated and it is slow. Too much money for too little product.
3,Toyo Mini Splits,"Be careful buying Toyo Mini Splits. I bought one a few years ago and when it arrived it was a conventional unit and not an inverter controlled unit...Numerous attempts to contact the seller were fruitless and I finally refused to pay for it with my credit card company...It still sits in the garage as the Chinese distributor has been ducking the law for years, changing their name frequently and changing addresses...they are like wack a mole, hit em one place they pop up somewhere else...Its too bad as the Toyo is an excellent unit but their distributor is not being honest with their customers..."
5,Excellent,"This must be one of the best unknown groups in their time, pitty they could only release one album.Could have been like The Stylistic, Chi-Lites , and Blue Magic in their time."
4,"Great gloves, but...","i've purchased/used several pairs of these gloves over the last few years. Overall, they are great for lifting... comfortable, well-padded, washable, easy on and off, etc. However, they tend to break down in certain areas fairly quickly which is the only reason they are not 5 stars to me. For example, the most recent pair i bought in August are already showing signs of distress and the thumbs on both gloves have started to tear at the seams. maybe it's just me but this is the same pattern that i experienced with the previous pair. i recommend the gloves but you have to expect the useful life to be less than 1 year."
1,Tore in a few weeks,Read all good reviews but started to tear on the strap & a few places on the glove itself.Thumb hole is spaced far from fingers and hurt my thumb.Hurt between my fingers also.
2,disappointment,"don't expect matt pond PA out of this band. while they have similar acoustic guitar sounds, they just don't compare. matt pond has an amazing voice and writes such beautiful songs that can never be recreated without him. i've listened to the album over and over again, and just can't get into it. there's maybe two songs worth listening to. that's it. this is probably polyvinyl records' biggest disappointment to date."
3,What is Truth?,"An unusual, yet compelling explanation of the UFO phenomena. The author's point of view is that these UFO's are not from another planet, but from Earth. Exiting from openings near both poles, the ""spacecraft"" have the ability to move in and out of the physical realm. They are more ""spiritual"" than ""material"" and have both good and evil components. If you are a student of the Bible, read Ephesians chapter 6. Nonetheless, I could not really get into the personal relationship that the author said to have established with one of the beings mentioned. The photographs within the book are truly spectacular, but are they real? I have to give this a mid-range review: Some good points raised, but I remain a bit skeptical."
3,Shock-A-Lots,"I am a coffee drinker, therefore I like the Shock-A-Lots.I usually stay away from candy, too much sugar. These are differentand tasty if you like coffee. However, you pay a lot for very little,too exspensive."
5,Not just Candy,"Shock-a-lots. I saw this candy on the Food Network episode of Unwrapped. A Yellow hard candy shell around dark chocolate with a coffee bean in the center. What's not to love. A 1 oz. bag of Shocks-a-lot is equivalent to 2.5 cups of coffee. Small downside pieces of the coffee bean, after chewing got stuck in my teeth. Nothing a soda or cup of java didn't wash away. If you love coffee and chocolate give this candy a try. I think you will enjoy it.J. Stagl"
4,A good collection of Christmas silent films,I really like silent films and these were good although some seemed to be as if they were home movies but it was still good although a little confusing. Some were really funny and I love to see how things were done differently then which may explain the home movie type on some. Other than that if you're a silent film buff it's a good one to add to your collection.
1,not good,"I thought this would be full of old, magical looking Melies-like films, but it's a bunch of home movies, some very lame Alskan footage passing for the north pole, and an endless story about a sad family.Consider how few good christmas movies come out nowadays, then imagine the same films 100 years from now. Will those movies be better? No, they will stink. Like these do."
4,"Love the films, love the music--","As has been said in other reviews, this DVD (which I original saw on TCM as well) is a strange, moving, sometimes boring, but generally wonderful time-trip back to another era. (I still don't really get ""Santa Claus vs. Cupid,"" but, hey, it doesn't bother me...)I am one who thinks the music is haunting, strange--and perfect for this collection. It does add a touch melancholy to the procedings, but it works for me. Some of the most beloved Christmas songs are melancholy--look at ""Have yourself a merry little Christmas"" and ""White Christmas""--looking back in memory, expecially of Christmases past, can definately involve a bit of that."
1,Lasted only a few days,"I have an 80lb female lab mix. She only wore this collar a couple of days. Then the other night, the D ring ripped right off of it when she was on her lead and took off on me. Luckily she came back a little while later. The stitching is just not strong enough to hold a large dog."
3,Not Bad But...,If you like the X-Men and want to read an X-Men book then pick this up. It's an easy read but has little action or interesting points.
3,just a bit too preachy,"i picked this book up because, 1) i am an x-fan, and 2) i was looking for a light read. boy i was wrong. this book looked into the prison system of today's world, and she had a lot to say, too much to go into here (though i would like to remind the author, that the people in prisons are criminals, so the sympathy and their rights can only go so far). we also get the author's view on the dangers of technology and out addiction to tv and video games. the book actually turned out to be a bit of a dissapointment. the story wasn't that great, and it was a bit preachy. go with the other x-titles."
1,not so good,"Hay there, have you ever read a book written by a seminist? NO? wel then you would get to go through the agony should you decide to buy this book. I do not know which X-men this author is writing about, but I am most certain they are not the X-men that I have come to know and love. Well you see through out the book the author can not help but to keep giving you the imperition that men are animals that are always after women and trying to suduce them? Also Cyclops is not with the team so Stom is leading the team. What a coincident! The botom line is this. I would not have minded the foolishness of the author if the story line was decent but that is more than wishful thinking when it comes to this book. Unless you are trying to complet your colection, do not waste your money and buy this bok."
1,Not what I expected,"My stylist uses this sprayer and I was looking for a fine mist sprayer to do mine and my kids hair. I bought 2 of these and they both are terrible. They don't spray anything half the time and the other half they splatter water down the middle of the spray stream. I don't know if I've gotten a ""knock-off"" product, but so far I'm extremely disappointed with the product."
2,A complete disappointment,"I like Stratovarius a lot, one of the first bands that got me into power metal...but this DVD is really a shame. Choppy quality, songs randomly fading in and out...its just ridiculous. Its a funny dvd, the backstage stuff is pretty cool and for that it gets 2 stars, but the DVD doesnt do their music justice at all. Whoever organized this should be fired. Halfway into black diamond, my favorite stratovarius song, it just fades out into Tolkki complaining that there's a lot of touring to do. What the hell? It wouldve been really easy to make a good DVD for strato, theyve toured a thousand times, and this shabby collection of poor quality bootlegs is not worth your money. Borrow it from a friend for the laughs like I did, but thats bout it."
2,two bottom drawer 1950s sci-fi films,"Many put down low-budget 1950s sci-fi films but a number of them are fun to watch today, partly from nostalgia of growing up in the period. Those made by studios like American International did a fine job on low budgets but others, such as these, are among those that give the genre its bad reputation. The ""acting"" in ""Beast"" is especially bad, making Ed Wood look good by comparison. The soundtrack hilariously is a ""Wagner's Greatest Hits"" medley. ""Phantom"" is considerably better by comparison."
2,Absoultely Boring!,"I'm usually a big fan of the classic scifi/horror flicks. These 2 are real sleepers though. I'll give credit to the actors, but the plots leave much to be desired. I guess the titles didn't fit the movie, and the artwork was somewhat overdone."
2,Not much here..........but that 's the way it goes.,"The first of this double feature is MISLEADING! There is no beast with 1,000,000 EYES! BOGUS MANUEVER! It is just a metaphor for everything having eyes! Don' t bother.The second one was at least about a real/fake creature! It was okay. A little difficult to be entertained by since there was too much dialogue and not enough cheesiness! The monster was BLAST to watch! There should have been more!MV"
4,A great book to try on your first transmission,"Although successful rebuilding engines, I thought transmissions were taboo. Then I broke the reverse band on my sons 1990 Chrysler 404 3-spd tranny and threw in one from the wrecker. I bought and studied this book cover to cover and even though it didn't specifically show a 404, it helped me figure out the basics and theory from all the others shown. The vehicle's repair manual I had gave me the band adjustments. So, I ordered up the new band, seal and gasket kit and thrust washers, and set to work. This book gave me all the advice and warnings necessary, the puppy's back together, back in the vehicle and running perfectly. Which is just as well since my son totalled the tranny from the wrecker - have you ever seen a differential explode?"
1,Use at your own risk,"I bought three sets of this. One morning I walked into my garage and discovered a flat tire. Took the tire off and took it to the local walmart for repair. They came back saying there was nothing wrong with the tire. I came back, tested the valve that was on the tire and guess what? The valve was defective and caused all air to be expelled. I immediately took all of them off from all tires. Cannot risk having flats when I am not expecting it. Sent one set (the other two sets were past 30 days) back and got only 66 cents in refund (thanks, AMAZON.COM for your generosity). I am trying to find a way to let Amazon.com know that I am not happy with the refund but have not found a way to contact them yet. At any rate do not buy this product, too risky...."
1,1 out of 4 worked,"I bought this product with high hopes. On the same tire with pressure of 32psi, one cap showed all green, the other three did not. Now I'm even wondering about the reliability of the one that showed all green. Can I trust it from a company that has such poor quality control?"
3,1 out of 4 defective,"Pressure in my tires are all at 32lbs, yet one reads as if it is low. Reads the same when I switched the defective one to another tire, so it is not my gauge or the tire."
1,Leaky - don't use,"tried a set of these out and found out that a couple of them were the source of air leaks. Sure, they told me that I needed air, but they weren't exactly helping me save time! So off they came."
4,Fair romance,"Seamstress of cold but beautiful Lady Raven agrees to marry Lady Raven's estranged stepnephew to help him inherit his parent's home before he turns 30 & as a way out of her limited opportunities. Both fall in love with each other despite their nonconsummation of their marriage in beginning months due to assumptions they both had about each other. Meanwhile, they are both dealing with other consequences of Lady Raven's nefarious behaviors.Kingsley's book had good romance & sensuality. What made this romance novel unique & refreshing was that the confessions of love occur by middle of the book. Their big misunderstandings were resolved & the romance blossomed further from there. It wasn't a very heavily emotional book but there's some angst. What irked me, though, and thought was very superfluous was heroine finding towards the end that she's from a royal family. It would've been better if her family/social status was left average or impoverished.Recommended."
4,Seeking Justice,"I like Nickolas Cage movies, All except some remakes that he did.But all in all its a good movie and i liked thie one."
5,Nick Cage fan.,This was a better movie than several of Nick Cages recent films. I could see how someone could get wrapped up a vigalanty mode after seeing a loved one hurt. The movie draws you into his desperation at seeing his wife scared and hurt after a brutal attack and someone offering to avenge this terrible act. As in Starchamber things get worse.
3,"RENT this movie only, dont buy it!","This is a good entertaining movie to view and pass the time away. The storyline, acting, wardrobe, and sets are very good. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography. However, this is NOT a movie that is good enough to buy. It’s best to RENT this movie."
3,Very Average,"Sort of slow moving, but original and worth the watch. It's no con air or the rock, but cage holds his own. overall, the trailer is better than the movie, and while the dialogue isn't the greatest, the premise of the movie will keep you watching till the end."
3,"Not too bad, but far from great","I really enjoyed watching the trailer when it first came out, & then just recently watched the movie on Blu-Ray. I liked it overall, the cinematography, acting & action (2 scenes really caught my attention; SPOILER ALERT : The truck swerving & narrowly missing our 'hero' which was shot live! & the cameraman sliding down the escalator with the actors make us viewers feel closer to the action). However, the ending was way too predictable & thus, a letdown. Could've been a much better movie."
4,Totally Nicolas Cage,"Just what you'd expect from a Nicolas Cage movie. Tough, suspenseful, gritty action.Four stars just because some scenes made you grunt out loud ""ah!! Why would they do that?!"""
3,"Variation on the ""Death Wish' movies","This is a movie with several titles but not that much box office success.Cage stars a mild mannered teacher whose wife is raped. At the hospital where she is on the mend, a mysterious stranger offers to ""take care of things"" for him by having the rapist killed in exchange for a future favor. He implies that the future favor might be something very minor so Cage takes the deal. Of course, the favor is not minor at all as everyone in the audience knew but Cage did not.From there, Cage becomes like a Hitchcock wrong man on the run more than a Charles Bronson type vigilante. There are a few plot twists and the movie is fairly well done. A middle of the road outing for the prolific Cage but no ""National Treasure""."
2,Not recommended,"Seeking Justice is, at times, a suspenseful if also fairly implausible and poorly acted movie. Nicholas Cage is merely passable in the role of the man-in-too-deep character, Guy Pearce is flat as a smooth talking bad guy, and January Jones is tepid as the victim/wife. I never felt engaged in the characters and this made the hundred minutes or so seem longer despite some fairly quick pacing once the movie turned from suspense to action.On the whole, the flat acting, a shortage of truly unique twists, inexplicable scenes (the Superdome....why??), and an unsatisfying end left me feeling disappointed in Seeking Justice. It's not an awful movie by any means, but it's not anything I'd care to see a second time. I'd not recommend buying it until after you've had a chance to see it for free on cable."
4,Nick Cage Fan's Sigh of Relief,"I'm a Nick Cage fan and have been disappointedly watching his films slide into ""B"" status for years. I sighed with relief while I watched Seeking Justice, as I found it quite a bit above a ""B"" movie. While it is unmemorable when measured against Con Air, Matchstick Men, Adaptation, City of Angels, The Family Man, and, of course, Moonstruck, it is highly watchable and has just enough thriller to justify its signified genre. Guy Pearce is a very nice bad guy and January Jones is adorable as the action heroine/damsel in distress. Seeking Justice has a decent script with a few twists, chase sequences, plot variations, and, for us Nicholas Cage fans, this one gets 4 stars just because it doesn't suck."
4,A Thriller with a Twist,"Seeking Justice turned out to be a better film than I had anticipated. The plot, while being quite familiar for an action movie, has some unexpected psychological twists and turns that grabbed my attention early on. The action is fast-moving and the story line remains interesting and intriguing throughout. It's a really decent ""What Would You Do?"" movie. The acting is good. If you are a fan of Nicholas Cage, you'll love the film. But even if you're not, the film itself will engage you and possibly surprise you. January Jones does a great job in her role, and Guy Pierce is quite believable as Simon. Definitely worth the watch!"
2,Too implausible to enjoy,"Nick Cage's movies are sometimes really good, but often just fair. This movie was too implausible for me to enjoy."
2,Its not worth your time,"Nick Cage is way past being worth watching as an actor which is why I only bought/watched this movie to see Guy Pearce who still is. Alas, in this psychologically dumb ""the vigilantes are killing everybody"" movie Cage runs around trying to figure out what's going on while Guy Pearce just walks thru his role and adds no 'menace' at all which would have helped. January Jones is beautiful and complicated and more interesting in the film then either 2 men. Unfortunately, when January turns into the hero at the end using her new found ""Annie Oakley shooting skills"", the movie just tanks and you regret wasting your time like I did."
2,A bit too implausible for my taste,"I don't mind it when movies are unbelievable. After all, it is make believe. However, when they are supposed to be action packed and fail at that too then the story line becomes more important. This movie had great potential for suspense and action but failed at both. Consequently, that the story line is so hard to believe, there's little to get excited about with this flick that just never comes together. There's nothing wrong with the acting, it's just a weak plot and weak with action and suspense; something critical as this is supposed to be an action packed thriller. Too bad."
2,Seeking Originality,"Nicolas Cage keeps churning out forgettable films - the latest being a ""Death Wish"" rehash. Initially titled ""The Hungry Rabbit Jumps,"" the competently slick ""Seeking Justice"" (2011) is familiar stuff. However, Cage and director Roger Donaldson have done worse. The always-watchable Guy Pearce steals the show as a sinister vigilante mastermind."
3,Corny but entertaining,"Plot corny and unrealistic,but Nicolas Cage managed to keep it entertaining wanting to seek revenge for his wife or I'm just partial to Nicolas."
3,Seeking Justice Review,"Nicolas Cage's best was Con Air, it seems everything since hasn't been quite as good. His acting seems forced, and he doesn't seem to really try."
3,"Formulaic thriller, plods at times","An interesting movie, certainly watchable, but not one of Nicholas Cages better offerings.This movie is being compared to the Death Wish movies, owing to it's vigilante theme, and it's certainly gritty, and absorbing in places. However, it lacks any of the depth or believable qualities of the former, and stretches the suspension of disbelief, frequently.The acting is solid, not stellar, and it was interesting to see Guy Pearce in yet another quirky role.For fans of the genre, there will probably be enough to keep watching, but it plods a little for my taste, with few surprises.The ending is reasonably satisfying, and not overly moralistic, but overall I gave it three stars. Rainy day movie."
2,no file flexability,"Recording functionality is fine, quality is fine. But I have had huge battles transfering the files to my computer, so they can be viewed on the internet, and sent to friends. The files are in a VRO and IFO format. I have been able to get it to work somewhat by changing the VRO file to a MPG file. But it doesn't view properly if there are multiple clips in the file, unless I combine them all into one file on the camcorder first. I would also have loved it if I were able to just download one clip off my camcorder or somehow seperate them, so they can be viewed as separate files. So far my answer has been to get several discs and switch the disc everytime I want a new clip to be separate from the others. then I upload them off each disk seperately. I have tried using different software types and I haven't found one that solves the problem. If anyone knows and easier way to fix this problem, I would love to hear about it."
2,dont waste your money,"i was expecting much more from jus allah, coming from jedi mind tricks and all, and i guess that may be one of the reasons why im so disappointed with this album. there are only about 2-3 songs i like to listen to, and a couple others i can stand, but most of this album is worthy of skipping over. i believe that jus allah simply cant hold down his own album without the talent of jmt around him. if you wanna see allah shine, buy jmt's violent by design or if youre looking for some solid hip hop, check out army of the pharoahs, a side project including vinnie paz, planetary, reef the lost cauze, esoteric and 7L, des devious, apathy, and other greats. do not spend money on this album."
4,Pay respects to allah,"jus allah broke every Jedi Mind Tricks fan's heart when he left them after ""Violent By Design"" he was a key part in the group, as a Jedi Mind fan one of my worst days was when he decided to leave, and one of my best days was when he decided to reunite with them. ""All Fates Have Changed"" is a great cd, there are some songs on there that are old solos that were never put out, so those are on there, and some great new ones trust me. Knew listeners will be blown away. Please pick this up, the songs that stand out to me are; ""Porno Flick Bitches"" ""Supreme(black god's remix)"" ""Pool of Blood"" ""Supreme"" ""Eyes of a Disciple"" all of the bonus tracks and many more, help allah out and buy this, you wont regret it."
1,jus allah dissapoints,was expecting more from this album. Jus Allah can't hold down an album by himself and the production is sub par. GZA track is good but overall this album is weak. this just shows why he got the boot from JMT. pick up any of their albums over this garbage.
2,This album sucks,"Im a big Jus Allah fan but this album is so disappointing that im speechless. Go pick up the latest Jedi Mind Tricks album Legacy of Blood, and Visions of Gandhi. All Fates Have Changed is not worth the 20$ I spent. :/"
1,Worse than bad,"Worse than bad! I would have given zero stars if I could have.The audio was missing from all but 2 of the songs on the second CD. Actually, that was a relief considering how badly the music was performed. The recordings were poorly done, with songs ending abruptly before they were over. An overall bad experience.Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Beautiful Dinnerware,We were really so pleased when this dinnerware arrived. It is so much prettier in person! It has worn well and I think a tremendous value! Couldn't recommend it more highly.
3,Fairly Mellow.,"I found this cd to be more mellow that I bought it for. I thoght the tunes were between a MOS (fast) and cafe del mar (lounge). This is good background party music with some tunes you can recall from other cds, like:- Release Yourself by Copyright- Deeper in love by Bobby and SteveMy favorites are:- I just wanna be by Jay ""Sinister""- Come on and Dance by CeCe Rogers- Committed by HardsoulEnjoy the tunes!"
4,Great for the price...,"I just use it to show things to my clients...not for teaching a class. For the price it's a great product!!! There are extra parts that come with it, and the directions aren't very straight forward, but it's not that bad...only reason I won't give it a 5 at the price."
1,Budget Bucky Returned,Budget Bucky Skeleton With Stand -5 1/2 Feet TallThis product is poorly made . The skeleton had two left feet and the spine was twisted badly and I am not talking about the normal curves of the spine. I feel like I am getting the run around with the company as to whether I will get a full refund as they determine whether the product is suitable and defective not me even though I took photos.
1,Don't Buy This One - Save Your Money!!!,"This doesn't even deserve one star. The only thing that this DVD would be good for is a gag gift, because it is actually so bad that it makes you laugh - but only in a painful kind of way. What it is, is a series of amateur footage of different breeds of puppies, with each breed being shown for about five minutes. While you are viewing the puppies, you listen to the inane chatter of the narrators, whose dialogue is so pathetic that after 2 minutes you will wonder why you are still sitting there watching. And it only gets worse. My 5 year old watched for about 5 minutes, then said ""This is too weird, Mom"" and left the room. Not being as smart as a five year old, I sat and watched about 20 more minutes of the moronic ""skits"" before turning it off. So, consider yourself warned - save your money for something else!"
2,A bad one-act play stretched out to 86 minutes...,"The first ten minutes of DEVIL'S ROCK are tense and gripping - so, two stars instead of one... But once the Allied soldiers are in the Nazi stronghold, the movie devolves into a three-character, two-set play, with NOTHING happening, for the bulk of the movie. Somehow, the demon summoned by the Nazis to win World War II is the ultimate weapon - except for the fact that she can be shackled with ordinary iron shackles, and then is completely powerless. That leaves the surviving soldier, and his Nazi captor, to BICKER, for the bulk of the endless 86 minutes. Tedium ensues...and when the demon finally stops shape-shifting into the soldier's dead wife - gee, where have we seen THAT before? - and shows her true red horned self, she looks like a pissed-off extra from HELLBOY. The actors are talented, the few locations are spooky - so, overall this feels like a decent opportunity wasted by a script that might've worked better as a short."
2,Stupid,Don't waste your time watching this one it is too stupid Jeeppers creepers is the only one to pull off a real creature movie
3,gore and more,a very simple plot with lots of blood and guts.while very little character background is needed for this story it still manages to keep your attention/ whether by the literal blood and guts seen or the fact that the nazi ss did openly pursue such legends and folklore.
3,D LaDuke,I was surprised that this movie turned out to be interesting and with a lot of action. I expected a c type vampire movie.
2,This...movie....was....retarded,"I am sorry. My sister recommended this movie to me and I am starting to wonder if maybe, we have different parents for real....I like a good horror,gory,weird whatever what have you kind of movie but...this movie was dumb."
4,Well above average in its class,"Decent acting combined with a creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere and an isolated setting make this a 3.5 star flick in its class - well above average. I also tend to like horror movies set during WWII, such as this one, which constitute a sort of sub-genre unto themselves (The Bunker, The Outpost, and Below are three other good examples). There are some other nice touches as well, such as allusions to Raiders of the Lost Arc and HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. Be warned that Devil's Rock is extremely bloody and gruesome."
5,Tons of Fun Teaser Ball,"This ball is as much fun, maybe more:), for humans as it is for our dogs!!!! Drives them crazy! Kind of mean, but hysterical to watch them try to get the small ball out of the big ball. Keeps my Rotties busy!"
4,better than plastic,Bought these together with the corresponding full-length drawer slides to replace contstantly breaking European style drawer slides with plastic fittings. These work very well and are relatively easy to adjust. It is probabably easier to intall them when cabinets are being constructed than retrofitting but both ways work.
2,Bad sound quality,"I must have had a bad pair. The one that I ordered sounded terrible. No bass what so ever. No instructions on how to put these on so I tried every which way, but still no go. I considered returning it but since it only cost $13 to buy, I wouldn't even waste my time."
3,good sound but not for exercisers,"sound quality is good, but the trick of using the wire that you tighten around your ear still does not give the stability during exercise and does not hold the buds into the ear"
1,Tendentious and misleading,"This is a totally tendentious version of what happened at Entebbe, at odds with the official IDF history written by Avigdor Shahan (Operation Yonatan, formerl Thunderball) and the autobiography of the Sayeret Matkal commander around whom the operation was built, Muki Betser. His book, Secret Soldier: The Autobiography of Israel's Greatest Commando, is available at Amazon."
2,I Don't Like this CD,"Interactive? My eye! Only that silly video appeared, and there was only the On and Off buttons. What. A. Gyp. Disappointed."
2,Great Retailer Book lacks full ability,"I am a horse trainer, I recently got into cowboy dressage. Looking for more information came across Jack Brainard as a cowboy dressage person. However I purchased this book and the book retailer was excellent, question the shipping price but was shipped in a timely manner and was in the condition stated. Overall a good business transaction. The book content is lacking, as is many of the horse training books I have found on the market. Everybody hits a couple points, leaves out important detail and yep you got a inflated magazine article leaving you wanting more. As I have found with many books, clinics and instructors - I walked away with a couple nuggets but the pot of gold was not there. This will remain in my library but it lacks in complete horse knowledge..... Rafe"
3,Dance until you can't dance no more,"Sweet Sensations' ""Take It while It's Hot"" Is a very good dance album. It's a little hard not to move to the beats of ""Never Let You Go"", or getting up and jamming with the title track. Vocally, these three girls are not something to write home about and it's not the most compelling of all music that you'll ever hear. But it is a light hearted, feel good album that you can sit at home and move to (or clean to). I saw them in concert, and I will say , they do produce alot of energy on stage, as does thier music. You will find yourself singing,"" I'm hooked on you."" You'll get hooked on this Cd."
3,I Question Some of the Concepts,"I had a very mixed reaction of this book, which served as the catalyst for my recent paper on parallel universes and found it to be a very interesting read. What I most appreciated however was that when I asked M.R. Franks about some details in his book he sent me three articles within about two hours. What disappointed me however was the shortness of the book and the focas on cited works from other authors and I don't really buy the andriod therory persented at the end of this book."
2,What's the hidden message?,"There seems to be a hidden agenda in this book. ""God created the universe."" And that is probably true, but I wish the author had been more up front about it. The information is ok. There are many assumptions and he doesn't back up his theories extremely well. Basically, if you can agree that ""you"" move constantly through static universes you get the whole book. Now pick your destiny!"
4,It's a start of a beautiful thought process,"Short but well written. Difficult to know what's correct about the concept of multiple realities in real life. Maybe yes or maybe not. Maybe both.This could explain how affirmation/ law of attraction works. You flip to another reality when you affirm a new idea. It doesn't happen fast (at this time) like in Bewitched but a person ""grows"" into the new reality."
5,Great read for anyone!,"This is the first book that I have been able to understand on multiple realities - there is NO fluffy bunny aspect just an intriguing wonderful book. Franks was able to explain the how to magick, miracles and manifesting. Cover to cover - just fantastic!"
1,Beautiful but breakable!,"This item came with two of the serving pieces broken into pieces in the box. It looked like poor shipping; we certainly handled it gently. It was not worth the long list of instructions to send it back for a replacement, so we didn't bother. The pieces not shattered were very pretty, but you must wrap it professionally before you send it or forget it."
2,Beautiful but VERY fragile,"I bought 3 sets of these to match the wedding cake server bequeathed to me by my grandmother for my wedding. They were perfect for serving food at the wedding, both hot and cold. The reason they get 2 stars is this - they were WELL PACKED in prep for a move from house to house - box in a box in a box. There were some temperature extremes between when they were packed and when they were unpacked 6 months later, but I never expected 3 of the 10 utensils' handles to break cleanly where the silver meets. They looked as though someone snapped them over a knee, and all in the same place. There was no impact or pressure - they simply apparently committed hari-kari. Great for short term use, but don't expect to put them away and have them be okay a year later... even if well packed & padded."
4,Buy this album!,"After hearing clips of every song, I am convinced that this is the most complete album I have ever heard! Match talented musicians with soulful vocals and intense lyrics, and you won't just hear Fringe-you will feel them."

3,Doesn't Come with Instructions,"The tie is OK, you'll have to look up instructions online though, doesn't come with. Do practice, the material is very soft silk and may not knot the same way other ascots do."
3,"A bit dark, but good story","Kind of a neat twist - lady blacksmith takes on wacko cultists.Gripping story, but some bits that are pretty dark. Would read another by her, but it got passed on to my reading buddy instead of going onto the ""keeper"" shelf."
1,Big Shot quite baffle not correct size,I purchased Vance and Hines Big Shot quite baffles.I removed the original baffles and discovered they are 3 inches in diameter.The quite baffles are only 2 inches in diameter and a lot shorter in length.They simply are not designed for my pipes.Are there different types of quite baffles for Big Shots ? If so they don't make that clear.My bike is a 2008 Roadstar Silverado and I just purchased the Vance and Hines BIG SHOTS for it.These baffles are unless for me.
4,V&H Quiet Baffles,Excellent product - helps to reduce some Decibels and gives the bike a deep throaty sound versus the standard baffle with more of a metal sound.
1,very disappointed,"Very poor quality for Pfaltgraff. Although pretty, I returned this item to the manufacturer. The metal pieces (knobs at top and utensil itself) easily detaches from plastic stem. My kids turned it into a game a meal time to see if they got the 'lucky broken utensil'! So many came apart that we all won! The utensils themselves are huge as well. Open wide for the soup spoon! The salad forks and teaspoons are the size of regular pieces in most flatware sets. The soup spoons and large forks are long and wide. Never seen a utensil so large. I would not recommend this product at all."
2,A little dissapointing,"Although quite pretty and pleasing in the hand, these are not terribly well made. As noted by another reviewer, the plastic handles don't seem to be at all well grafted to the metal (I don't have kids pulling mine apart, but nonetheless, half of them are wobbly), and additionally, the design element wears away quickly. I don't have a dishwasher and have always carefully washed these by hand, but in less than six months, the blue in the pattern is fading, drastically reducing their visual appeal. Apparently from the school of cheap and cheerful, except for the fact that they're pricey and, after a few months, kinda sad looking...."
5,RUN TO GET THIS CABALLE!,"I say run to get this recording, you know how briefly they stay in print. This is a gleaming collection of Caballe's art. A wide span of recording years is covered here. Beginning delightfully with ""Hijo de la luna"" and a set of Spanish songs, the magic comes on quick. A recent version here of ""My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice"" is an irreplaceable treasure. Such understanding in the singing, such intelligent and mighty phrasing - just wonderful! And ""Io son l'umile ancella"" is rendered with colossal artistry, the final rising phrase so laden with genuine patience, it turns the merely artful into true art. It's a remarkable rendering of Cilea's aria. Disc 2 is the more expansive of the two- Caballe's take on ""Sempre libera"" ('67 version here) has no real peer, except maybe Sutherland's. The Charpentier is delicious as can be. What is that lingering feeling around this woman's singing? She is an uncompromising artist, we're so lucky to have these recordings."
4,1991 and Back/ Caballe Risks Comparisons With Her Younger Self,"Montserrat Caballe went into the recording studio a number of times in 1991 with various conductors and orchestras. There was just about enough new material to make a single CD. BMG decided to combine the new material with older reissues to make a two CD set. The 1991 stuff, including several items that she had not recorded elsewhere under studio conditions is pretty irresistible. (Arias from MARIA STUARDA, LE CID, CARMEN and SAMSON ET DALILAH, a song from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and a vocal arrangement from Rodrigo's CONCIERTO DE ARANJUEZ as well as some Spanish popular songs and Zarzuela arias are unique in Caballe's discography.) That the 1991 recordings largely hold their own compared to recordings made twenty five years earlier is a tribute to Caballe's extraordinary vocal technique and artistry. Only a few wiry high notes betray the passing of time.This is a very strong recommend."
3,Bulldog Mom,Love the collar our female looks so wonderful in her collar--my only complaint is the color has changed to a dark red--and some of the metal around edge has come off and are sharp
5,RARE BUCKY FOOTAGE AN HISTORICAL GEM !,"THOUGH POORLY PRODUCED AND APPEARING TO BE RATHER KOOKY CABLE TV PROGRAMS, NEVERTHELESS THE BRILLIANT MIND OF FULLER, AS ALWAYS, SHINES THROUGH. QUOTE : ""WE ARE, THERFORE, INHERENTLY IMMORTAL."" IF YOU ARE A FAN OR STUDENT OF BUCKY'S WORK THESE RARE FILMS ARE ABSLOLUTELY WORTH YOUR WHILE."
2,Repetitive new-agey interviews with Bucky,There are three interviews on this dvd with Mr. Fuller. They are all from the mid 80's and all look like low budget public access shows. The interviews are not very worthwhile.
4,"Easy, and pleasant, to use.","From the picture I was a little skeptical about ordering this. It looks a little like a torture device! I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it up, and slipped it on my fingers. I have developed RSD from a previous injury, and this is great for nerve stimulation/desensitization - I know that sounds like an contradiction. It's stretchy, and fits easily over the fingers. The points are not sharp, the tips are slightly rounded, so it's not dangerous or painful. But there is enough texture to feel good when it's rolled up and down on each finger. I kind of wish it were big enough to be slipped over my arm, and rolled up and down. It's size makes it easy to carry with me in my purse."
3,Helps finger joint,"My finger joint swells and hurts. Rolling this 'ring' back and forth (up and down the finger over the joint) relives the pain and helps make that finger less stiff . That being said, with the swollen finger/joint the band/ring is tight and pinches a little, however it. Is better then when my finger throbs with no relive and can not bend."
3,Great until.....,"The ring was not what I expected. Its like having a mini slinky around your finger. It feels nice and relieves finger joint tension well. It is therapeutic to have a release of joint tension. It does not clean well, however, and you must make sure you don't leave it to dry on metal or it will rust the metal along with itself. I made the mistake and I could not use the ring again. For the price, it's not so bad, but I didn't even think of that possibility."
1,Useless,"A very silly, useless invention. Does not feel good at all. Does not even apply much pressure to the finger."
3,Somewhat satisfacroty,It really does not do much for you. It is pleasant to use. But I have not seen results as yet.
3,It is for fun,"It is a unique ring, it can massage my fingers, but I don't think this is good for you if you want a real massage, it is good for a little kid I guess."
2,in a moment of weakness,"In a panic for stocking stuffers, i ordered two of these right before christmas. what was i thinking?? What did WC Fields say about every minute?"
1,Inappropriate shipping vehicle and price,"I have already written a review and the seller has made a inappropriate response to that review!! Please read that which is already documented 5/12/07 with the reply on 5/14/07. The merchandise purchased was a small finger ring which weighed maybe an few ounces. It arrived to me in a box which could of housed hundreds of rings. It was obviously an inappropriate shipping container choice and I paid the $9.00 shipping cost which was ridiculous!!!! The seller needs to investigate why this type of mistake was made in this transaction so it does not happen in the future. My ring purchase certainly weighed less then a book or a CD . Sincerely, Lissa"
5,Perfect for what ails ya.,I need to order more of these. My clients love them and it is really helping their arthritis and neuropathy in their hands.
2,It hurts.,"I didn't find this therapeutic at all. I found it rather painful, but someone else might like it just fine. For me, the spikes were too much."
2,Interesting,"The paperwork that comes with the ring says that it is just supposed to wake your fingers up. You roll it up and down your fingers for stimulation. The other online items that I read had spoke about weight loss. I don't think that it has anything to do with that. It's interesting to look at, but doesn't really do too much. It's also not something that I would think you'd wear all the time. Not bad as an add on, but not something I'd spend a ton of money on."
2,Hmm,"Feels nice, but haven't really noticed any benefits. Just kind of tingly and fun to play with when I'm bored."
2,Weirdness,"I believe there is something to reflexology. But this ring is just poking your finger, even when you rill it up and down it seems unlikely to have any healing properties. It certainly is not attractive enough to wear as costume jewelry."
1,Acupressure Chinese Medicine Ring,"Junk!!! It is huge and rubbs the other fingers next to any finger I put it on. It looks hideous, and I could tell no benefit from it."
5,Feels good!,"I purchased this ring to try it out because it was a pretty small investment. I think it is a useful ring! It feels good to run it up and down your digits (fingers and toes). Massage and boost circulation. My kids like it too! It is a quiet 'fidget' for them while watching tv. We have only had it a few weeks, so it will be interesting to see how it stands the test of time and use. But considering what I paid, I will buy again if this one gets lost or stretched out."
4,A Great Follow Up to Big Wreck,"Ian Thornley definatly comes through on this one. I was a huge Big Wreck fan and when i saw this, i have to admit i was a little sceptacle but it was well worth the money. It is hard rocking album that is extremely well written. Even though i dont think it is as good as In Loving Memory Of... i still give it my stamp of approval. Any hard rock fan would appreciate it."
4,The album Audioslave didn't make yet,"When I hear this album, the only tip that it isn't Audioslave is the lack of Tom Morello's soaring guitar. Ian Thornley sounds a LOT like Chris Cornell and even looks a little like him. It certainly reminds me of Soundgarden, too. Well I like Audioslave and Soundgarden, and I like this album too. Good vocals, decent lyrics, great heavy guitar.I'll be listening to this album often, and I think I'll get out my old Soundgarden albums too."
5,Thanks!,"Thank you Thornley for being so friggin amazing, is the first thing I have to say. I can't believe that I had not heard of this band earlier, but better late than never. I heard ""So Far So Good"" and fell in love with their sound, so I thought why not check out the whole cd. I didn't expect the whole thing to be up to par with that song, but it is! I totally recommend getting this cd, there is no way anyone could possibly be disappointed with it. Five stars and nothing less than that : ).Can't wait for more Thornley this year!"
4,Another great canadian band!,"Well Canada has a reputation of having rock acts that make it big. In comes Thornley. I'v never had the pleasure of hearing Big Wreck, but i'm sure it was'nt better than Thornley. This band is amazing and this debut is full of melodic hard and mellow rock. The lyrics seem to be very personal and sound very passionate. The way this album has turned out u can definitely see thornley being one of the big canadian rock acts of the future."
5,great rock cd!,"this is a band to pay attention too. they will get big in a few years. if a band like nickelback can make it big, these will do very well for themselves. i was pissed when soundgarden went kaput and now i have a band to replace them."
5,Kinda ironic but sweet.,"the ironic thing is, i read a review of this album in a certain music magazine which shall remain un-named. The magazine said that this was chris cornell's side project from audioslave and said nothing of ian thornley. i was in the mood for some chris cornell so i went out and bought the album, but before i listened to it i scanned over the cd booklet and thought ""No Chris?"". but after listening to the whole album 8 times through, i gotta say ""chris who?""! Ian is indeed very similar to chris's soundgarden heyday vocals (thank god since chris's voice has decayed since he left soundgarden). Another ironic fact is that chris cornell actually has a poem called ""thornley"". BUY THIS ALBUM! IT ROCKS!!!"
3,"Thornley ""Come Again""","""Falling To Pieces"" 3/5""Come Again"" 4/5""So Far So Good"" 5/5""The Going Rate (My Fix)"" 4/5""Keep A Good Man Down"" 4/5""Easy Comes"" 3/5""Beautiful"" 4/5""Bright Side"" 3/5""Clever"" 3/5""Found Another Way"" 4/5""All Comes Out In The Wash"" 3/5""The Lies That I Believe"" 3/5Thornley's debut album, ""Come Again,"" is a great effort in the downward spiral that is the genre of alt metal. Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, Puddle Of Mudd. All these bands have delivered less than stellar releases, and it seems that only this band and Shinedown are worth listens. Some standouts include ""So Far So Good"" and ""The Going Rate (My Fix).""Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
4,"SO FAR,SO GOOD","solid effort from this 4 piece band.at first listen i heard hints of ""Soundgarden /Audio-slave"".also a bit of ""Vertical horizon"".There's some really great vocals on display here,and melodies/harmonies.the guitar work is also very heavy at times mixed with some acoustic intros.I'll have this disc in my player for awhile!not a weak track to be found,a solid buy!"
3,no subtlety,"Big Wreck had the skill to seduce a listener into a dark alley and then beat the crap out of them. Thornley is a bunch of thugs. Predictable, and typical for what's being promoted as music these days. If you liked Big Wreck you'll be able to listen to Thornley, and enjoy the familiarity. I miss the sophistication of the BW drummer and Thornley's guitars are disappointing. All you're left with is Ian T's vocals, which are good, but often compared to Zepplin, Aerosmith, SoundGarden. The lyrics are painfully unspired, when compared to his previous work. I'll probably still buy the next release."
5,About Time!,"I am so glad that there is a band that knows how to play some good music! Its an ""all occasion"" cd. you can chill out and listen and or your at a party and wanna rock out throw it on cuz it'll get everyone goin!If you have a passion for music and a real appreciation for it then you will ove this cd. ""come again"" is by far one of the best songs that i have ever heard."
4,Good Stuff,"This album is rocks pretty hard, all the songs are catchy and have heavy riffs except for a couple. The only problem with this album is that it sounds like Thornley is holding back on some places on the record. For example, when they are building up the interludes in the heavier songs you would think they were getting ready to bust out an awesome breakdown but they just go right back into the chorus lines, which is a total adrenaline killer. The vocals are great and the drums and bass are bad ass as well. Overall though the album is good, although I don't know if I would recommend it.Standout Tracks: (in no particular order)1. The Going Rate2. Easy Comes3. So Far So Good4. The Lies That I Believe5. Clever6. Bright Side"
1,"Ego, ego, ego","I wasn't sure what to expect before I read this since the reviews seem to be either really good or really bad, but after reading the book I have to agree with the bad reviews. I've read previous Dick Schaap books and for the most part they've been pretty good, but this one is all about his ego. He writes that a good interviewer will let his subject take over and be the focus of the story. Well, he should've followed his own advice and let the stories of his subjects take over. After all, I don't think anyone really cares if Schaap smoked pot with losers like Bill Lee and Joe Namath and I know I don't care that he has problems staying married since he fools around too much. He sounds a lot like Geraldo Rivera. This book is almost a carbon copy of Geraldo's ego-filled autobiography. The only thing flashing before Schaap's eyes is his ego and (...)."

2,These are not self stick as discribed,I only bought these so I'll I'd have to do is peel and stick on the wall. There is NO self stick on these as it says in the discription.
1,Not what I wanted,"I was looking for a way to make my wall into a picture gallery; where I could put up and remove pictures easily. I placed the squares on my wall with provided stick tabs but my pictures needed a spray glue on the back to stick to the cork panels. When Spring came and temperatures went up, all the cork panels fell off the wall. I am now looking for another solution."
1,Do Not Buy This Product!,"I put mine up yesterday in my bedroom and one by one, they each fell off during the night scaring the freckles off of me! Wasted money on this as far as I am concerned. I think I may use them to put my potted plants on."
1,"Product doesn't work, tech support doesn't respond","I bought the product v09 for Christmas present. After installation replacing the previous version, I was no longer able to manage partitions or operating systems. The product freezes the computer. The tech support site says to turn off video driver resolution, but this did not work. Emails to tech support have gone unanswered for 3 months."
1,Experts Only,"I have been configuring Windows systems for over 20 years. I used System Commander 7 years ago for some dual boot Linux systems and it was great.This version 9 is a nightmare. It will NOT work with Vista and after you buy it and go to the web site for support the site will tell you so.They offer a ""Vista compatible"" version you can download. It doesn't work either.As of this writing, I have been waiting 10 days for my 24 hour email technical support response.If you are using Vista, use the built in disk manager. It works.If you are not yet using Vista - *** D O N 'T ****"
3,Could have been better,"SC9 consist of 2 parts: the HD partitioning part and Boot Manager part.I have SC9 run in my computer and use it everyday to manage multiple OS in the same HD. The operation is painless once you set it up and you only need to configure once if you know what you are doing. Having said that beware that the HD partitioning part could only be run safely from the bootable CD at safe mode (640x480). Otherwise, it may hang and corrupt your partition. The OS Boot Manager part can be safely installed and run from the HD. Just make sure that only one primary partition is visible at a time with Windows Machine.Note: if you see a blank screen while booting from the CD, press 2 and that will bring you to HD partitioning part of the software."
1,Beware of System Suite 9,"In the last 30 days while being fully covered by System Suite, we have been infected with two viruses. We upgraded to SS9 and now our entire network is dysfunctional and we are losing operational ability as I write this. Avanquest does not respond. Their firewall is shutting itself off and on and it is blocking addressess that are common and allowing hackers. Stay away from these folks. I'm unloading this program from 260 machines today at my own expense in order to protect my customers from this product. This is costing me thousands....."
4,Works Great,I haven't had one issue with this product. I used it to create a 4 Partition machine with multiple OS. But you HAVE to make sure you hide the partitions from each one another otherwise it will fail.
3,slippery,"I bought these thinking they would be slightly smaller than my half sheet baking sheets. It turns out they are embossed with ""9.5 x 14.5"". Therefore they look like a forlorn raft floating on the sea. They are very non-stick. I used them first by turning them 90 degrees and overlapping them slightly to pour out some peanut brittle. They worked fantastic. Not only did they not stick to the brittle, but after cooling the extra mat not under the brittle was useful to fold over to break the brittle up. Cleanup was a water rinse. The two lost stars were for the size discrepancy."
3,ok product but size too small,"this product is ok, but i should have gotten a bigger size mat. i read other reviews that its color comes off if you're cooking food that contains lemon juice, I will keep in mind about that."
5,What an idea!,"I bought this because another customer gave me the idea in her written review to place it on the top of her toaster-oven. That's exactly what I did, and I'm so glad I did. It's safe, of course, on the hot surfaet of the oven - to place a serving plate or utensils while waiting for food to cook. And then a person could turn around and bake cookies on it, too. (Haven't tried that yet)"
4,good idea,"This mat fits on a cookie sheet easily, and keeps foods from sticking and staining. It's also easy to wash."
3,Size incorrect,"It says it's a 10x15 inch mat...but it's actually closer to 8x13. I was very disappointed that it was a 10x15 because that's the size of my cookie pan. I wasn't able to bake as many cookies as I normally do with the smaller size mat. Other than the size, the mat works great and does exactly what it's supposed to do!"
5,It is a good silicone mat,"The mat is just the right size for me, it lays flat when unrolled, and it is a great product."
5,great product,1-15-2012these are still holding up like new after several years of heavy use and quite a few pounds of hot candy poured on them---I have been looking for easier ways to make my candy and also reduce waste. These pan liners are great. i use them for my hard candy such as peanut brittle and toffee and I no longer have to butter my pans or line them with foil.These take great heat changes as I pour my syrup out onto the pan and it is at about 300 degrees. when the candy sets it just comes right off. And also being flexible allows me to crack the candy on the mat then pick it up and use the mat to pour the pieces into my containers.I have not used them for baking as I bake on stones anyway.
4,It works well enough,"I got this to place between the dough and my rolling pin. It has to be floured to keep it from sticking to the dough but it relieves me of the hassle of repeatedly flouring my rolling pin. This, like my other silicone mat, simply does NOT provide flour-free/stick-free dough handling."
1,Wrong Size,"If the size matters to you, pass this up.It is not 10 x 15, it's 9 x 14. What the description doesn't say is it fits pans that are 10 x 15. The actual product is not that size."
4,Works well but too small,"First- I don't know enough about baking to know when you would ever need a 10 x 15"" mat. It is too small for a cookie sheet and I wish I had noticed that before I bought it. I would have bought the 11"" one. This one leaves too much space around the edges so my end cookies are partly on the cookie sheet instead of the mat. Very frustrating! Otherwise, it works wonderfully. Nothing has stuck to it so far and my cookies come out great. It is easy to wash and so far it has kept its color though my other Wilton 11"" mat has started to darken."
5,Sets the standard,"This outstanding book fills a long-standing lacuna. It will immediately become the standard introductory text for Irish music, and it should remain so for the forseeable future--it's hard to imagine what could surpass it. The material is elegantly organized and very well presented. I particularly like the way that the reader is welcomed into real traditional music events; in these sections the material truly comes alive. The recorded examples are lovely."
2,A wonderful book for the terribly insecure.,"The book opens so energetically! The first few pages invite me into a world of self-discovery and fun. However, once things got going, I just felt like I was reading the diary of an insanely insecure woman living in France. Instead of exploring the mystique of French women and the secrets to their confidence and flair, it goes on incessantly about waxing, matching underwear, dieting, and how thin (elite) French women are. I've been to France and I felt that her obsessing over the ""perfectness"" of French women was over-the-top, and all it left me was feeling like I was reading a Cosmo article or some other trashy women's magazine. If you want to explore France and the spirit of the women there, steer clear of this book. Pick up one by Debra Ollivier or Julia Child's 'My Life in France.'"
5,Loved this book!,"I really liked the book, I found it to be an easy read, funny, informative and quite inspirational. Actually, I liked the book more and more as I kept reading it (except the chapter on lingeree - the author went on too long about the importance of wearing matching lingeree, etc - I did not think this topick deserved so much attention, but oh well, perhaps it does - afterwards I did go and buy myself a nice lingeree set! And new creams, and make up. ;)). I read this book on the bus on my way to and from work and looked forward to my bus ride every day - not a normal thing for me. I also purchased the other ""more famous"" book (""French Women Don't Get Fat""), but I thought it was a bit boring (I still finished it and can't say it was bad, just not as consuming). The latter talks mostly about diet while this book is much more entertaining and covers all aspects of French women lives. I am lending the book to everyone I know now, what a gem!"
4,not to be taken too seriously,"I enjoyed this short read in an afternoon. Having spent some time in France, there is some truth here. There is also something indefinable about the French, however focusing on ""elite"" French women did not allow the author to capture this essence. Many of the points were well made and I do not believe the author seemed bitter or envious.If this book offends, you are taking it too seriously."
3,Good insight into the lives of french women,"I am a French teacher and found this book to be interesting because it gives the account of an English women attempting to assimilate into the French culture. I did not really enjoy this book, though, and put in down after the first five chapters. It was hard to get into it."
2,don't waste your time,"This book is not funny as many readers have said. It gets very boring in a number of chapters. It basically describes French women as self absorbed, jealous, shallow, and uppity. The author seems obsessed with her own looks and weight. She paints all other women in comparison with the French as ugly, frumpy, dispassionate, and totally out of touch with their sensual selves. If you are looking for a boost to your self esteem and you aren't French do yourself a favor and Don't waste you time with this one."
3,"NOT FOUR BUT ONLY *s please be aware that this is the same book as ""Two lipsticks and a lover""","This is the same book. The tittle has been changed for the US market, not sure why....I almost bought both until I read reviews on the British Amazon."
4,Interesting Stories,"Interesting stories, but of course not all of it is true. The author tells amusing tales of her ""fish out of water"" experiences with French women; it's a wonderfully interesting culture. That the French women never leave the house looking grungy seems to be the main focus of the book, however, as the author focuses mainly on the fact that Parisian women refuse to ""let themselves go"" once they're married or when they grow old.I wasn't mystified and awed by the concept of women who wished to look put-together at all times, I was more interested in the bits about their love of art, intellectuals, celebrity, etc.Still, this book was a great fun read and though it's a broad generalization, I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for a good afternoon book."
1,Copy Cat,"The cover design of this book is shamefully copy-catty. While not at all related to the fabulous ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" books, this book imitates those of Mireille Guiliano's right down to the title font and the illustration style. It looks to anyone familiar with the original ""French Women"" books like Ms. Frith-Powell is trying to take a ride on another's wave of success. I'd like to think the publisher and not the author is responsible for this manipulative move (still sad). If the author is, I'd have to question her suitability for speaking authoritatively on the French Way. One thing the French are not known for is copying."
3,Good,"I love music from the Andes, but was a little dissapointed from this CD> Generally the songs are ""nice"", but not breathtaking. Good product for someone who has a CD collection and adds this one to it. But I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to get a real taste of the music. It's not original, meaning it has some ""westernized"" taste to it."
3,Crew on stage is so distracting it's hard to focus on performers most of the tape!,"Constant Distraction and apparent lack of respect for performers by non-playing crew on stage ruin the concert. -- Looks more like a rehearsal than concert. Songs are fine. Performers do their part well. But video is very hard to watch because of UNNECESSARY constant stage-crew activity - talking among themselves- walking across stage - total disrespect behind performers. - Makes a better ""listening"" concert than ""viewing"" concert."
1,Terrible,"This stuff is garbage. It's so dry that you cannot sink your iron into it as it burns, therefore it is difficult to tin the entire tip. The tip is left dull and grey. Regular solder does a better job at tinning. I threw this away after just a few uses. Stick with MG Chemicals."
1,Defective - dried out,Product arrived completely dried out and was not the brand shown on the website. Will buy locally in the future.
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent ! ! !",This is a quick read because it is so full of truth. It really touched me to read the words that I already knew in my heart and spirit. This man is brilliant. We are all related. This reaffirms that which we should all be aware of.
1,Trite,"Nothing of value here beyond George Catlin's Creed reprinted on the Foreward page and the references to the works of other authors. High school-level writing from an author with a huge chip on his shoulder. Mr. McGaa, it is not too late to take responsibility for your own life."
4,Walking The Red Road!,"To Learn to walk the Red Road of life, This is One of the Books to read. But only if you Love yourself. Ho Mitakuye Oyasin."
5,Simply Beautiful,"I enjoyed this book more than any ""plant"" book I have read in years. It is so well written and accompanied with beautiful pictures, I know that I will enjoy revisiting the book many times as I plan my new garden. No matter your garden style, there is something to be found within these pages that will inspire you."
5,Wonderful fun.,"Society bandleader Peter Duchin and Edgar Award winning author John Morgan Wilson team up and give us a smoothly written little mystery in ""Blue Moon.""Set in the San Francisco of 1963, they blend history with fiction in an action packed noirish plot.Celebrities and pop icons of the day from Joe DiMaggio to Andy Warhol---Jackie Kennedy to Jack Kerouac---Truman Capote to Willie Mays pop up along with a major part for Herb Caen.It has the feel of Archy McNally meeting up with The Thin Man---snappy dialogue, complex plot, lotsa characters with agendas, many cocktails, dead bodies and an alto sax playing San Francisco Inspector who sits in with the protagonist's (Philip Damon) band.It is an excellent amateur sleuth whodunit peopled with intriguing characters. The atmosphere of sixties San Francisco is truly captured.There are many laughs along the way. ""Blue Moon"" is big fun."
3,"Interesting, but needs more patterns.",I really enjoyed his step by step illustrations but found the number of fly patterns lacking in his book.
1,the World Series,I loved Stanley Fish's baseball analagy.Here is the scoreR H EFish: 1 5 0Sokal: 0 0 1
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!,"I was shocked to see this book is still available. I purchased this book when I was in my early 20's and drew so many of the things out of it that are still hanging on my parents walls over 20 years later! Anyone who purchases this book will simply love it. After 24 years since originally coming out (1988), the fact it is still available speaks volumes!"
3,Not a book for someone getting back into drawing,"Maybe it was just me, but I didn't feel the book provided adequate instruction for getting beyond the line drawing stage. It's way too advanced for a beginning artist or someone trying to get in the swing of drawing again."
5,Very informative,"Wonderful way to spend a cool day. Curl up with a pencil, good teaching book, and a drawing pad while the soup is cooking on the stove."
2,Great! Get It,You Know I loved this video and all of my friends wanted the and they are trying to save up their money to get it online!
3,"Beautiful photographs, OK recipes","This is a beautifully photographed book, but the recipes were only OK. I tried the Meyer Lemon Pound Cake (not bad, but nothing special) and the Pine Nut Wedding HEart Cookies (OK, but not worth the time and many steps it takes to make them). The authors seemed to have spent more time assembling props for the beautiful photos rather than testing recipes. Good book if you like reading cookbooks, rather than cooking from them."
5,heartwarming,This movie is very touching. It shows how family should stick together and be supportive during a family crisis.It also shows how true your friends can be when you get diagosed with a highly contagious disease.
2,terrible movie,This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The plot just never materialized. It was truly NOT a good movie.
3,They ar just OK...............,"They are ice quality tools and look just like the pic.................the only thing is I can't extract my blackheads and zits better with these then with my nails, in fact these leave more of a scar/mark then my fingers do!"
5,SUPER COOL CD,"When I saw this CD on Amazon I almost freaked!!! I'm almost a teenager and this CD is really cool!!! I bought it at Media Play in Worcester, because I liked the cover...it was really different..now I love the songs on it..you will too!!!"
5,Rockin,Loved the cd. I own it and it is one of my favorites. Too bad Amazon didnt have #13 listed for everyone to hear because it is the best. I give this album a triple AAA rating.
4,Great true story.,"This is a very inspirational story, and well worth reading. Although I have been disappointed by the Benges' writing in all of their books that I've read, this is still a great source of accurate information on Eric Liddell's life."
4,Battery Science: Widgets that Work,"I used this to teach my Webelos Scouts (age 10) how electricity works and make things go. They mostly had fun using the fan to make horrible noises cutting pieces of paper, but they got the point of the experiment.Requires fine motor skills; may be difficult for some to do without adult help."
1,Big Disappointment!,We purchased 2 as Christmas gifts - one to a great nephew in California who specifically asked for this and another for a neighbor boy. Neither motor worked so the books will need to be returned now which is a pain and may not be worth it. They were so disappointed as we were for them.
3,My confusion...,"Great science book for your kids. Just make sure when you order that the used book comes with the ""parts"" to perform the projects. I made the mistake of just ordering a used book without the parts."
1,Hard to use,"The instructions are fine, and the experiments look great. The supplies, however are lacking. The wires are not long enough, they have too much plastic coating on them, my son can't do the connections on his own, etc. disappointed."
3,broken motor,After playing with the motor for about 5 minutes one of the pieces fell off. Most of the activities in the book required the motor so could not be done. My daughter was very disappointed.
2,Finches & sparrows,"It is a nice book but my only complaint is that the birds in it are limited. It did not have indigo buntings and rose breasted grosbeaks, etc.Also, some of the descriptions do not seem accurate, eg differences between a yellow fronted canary and a yellow eye canary are not highlighted, and the female distinguishing markings are also not covered. The description on the song is also not accurate. I was disappointed with the book because I expected a lot more for the price I paid."
5,Why Was It A Flop?,"I saw this musical in 1968 with my girl friend, now my wife for 30 years and decided to buy the CD as a gift to honor the occasion of our anniversary. We both loved it then and after listening to the score again we can't understand why the musical was the first to lose 1 million dollars! The play is full of toe tapping songs as well as some wonderful ballads that suited Robert Goulet perfectly, with his deep melodic voice. If you love Broadway Musicals I recommend the investment in this recording."
5,It was a hit for me,"I saw the original show in 1968 on Broadway- could never figure out why it wasn't a hit, except that there was not a ton of ""action"" in it. The songs have stayed with me.."
3,Wish it was better,"This musical has Robert Goulet, David Wayne and Gower Champion, a score by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb, and a book by N. Richard Nash. What happened to it? Like several other shows on Broadway that season, it flopped. Perhaps for one thing Goulet does not sound like the Goulet of ""Camelot."" While he won the Tony that year, something is missing in this recording. There are some fun numbers, ""Without Me"" and ""he's Back."" The show seems to lack the spirit that other shows Kander and Ebb wrote have. I wish it was better because the premise has promise."
3,Res-Q Tape,"This tape is very strong so, if you plan to put it on material and then remove it at some point, you may have a tough time getting it all off depending on the type of material that you put it on. I put it on a curtain to hem it and couldn't get it all off when I wanted to change the hem.But if you want something fairly permanent, this should work."
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,"This product has been the best little helper I have had yet. It has done exactly what I wanted. I shortened a pair of cropped pants to make them look like gauchos with the tape and I closed a deep v-type neck opening on a sleeveless top. For me and my needs, this little tape is the best."
4,strong hold... with residue,"I had an urgent and important meeting the took me to the other coast with a pair of pants I had not worn since I lost weight (yes, bad idea!) The pants were too big and did not have the option of using a belt. A friend actually used the res-Q tape to tape my pants to my spanx to keep them up. It worked wonderfully, held them up even through trips to the restroom, the tape held tight. However, upon removal, the tape did leave behind some sticky residue on both the spanx and the pants. If you need to make an emergency wardrobe repair, this will help, but be prepared for it to leave something behind."
4,"Green color is Dark Olive.. not ""Wicked Witch"" vibrant green","We received our costume today. It fit my 11 year old girl very well, and seems quite durable and well made. That being said, I was disappointed that the shade of green shown in the photo does not come close to the shade of green of the costume. The photo on Amazon and the package show a vibrant ""wicked witch"" green. The color is actually dark ( almost black ) Olive Green. A very drab color of green indeed. My little girl is happy with it anyway."
2,Terrible Seller!!,"This was absolutely the worst online buying experience I have ever had. The seller sent the wrong size costume. When I contacted them -- they said to send it back, it would be a 2 week turn around and then they would resend the correct size. The problem was this was for HALLOWEEN and the costume would not have arrived in time. Despite the fact that THEY made the mistake -- they refused to be helpful. They take 2-3 DAYS to respond to e-mails and never once returned a phone call (I left at least 5 messages trying to get information.)I ended up returning the item and ordering it from another company. After the 2 weeks had passed -- I e-mailed them asking when the refund would be credited. They said it would be ANOTHER week to 10 days because they were ""busy.""Terrible, terrible customer service. I will never purchase from Toynk again."
4,Nice watch,This was a great purchase. the band is quite elegant and the face is very classy. The size is perfect for me. Like it alot.
5,My Wife Loved It,I bought this as a holiday gift for my Wife. She really liked it. It replaced a similar style Fossil watch; but it is much nicer.The reviews here were really helpful and the watch was exactly what I expected if not even nicer.
3,Not as big as it looks,Its a bulova so theres no doubt that its a nice watch but it wasnt big enough for me. I ended up selling this to a friend for less than what I paid for it here.
1,A Very simple watch!,"This is a very comon wacth, nothing spectacular in it, nothing that people will note. I really dont like it."
5,Very impressed,"This watch looks stunning. As others have stated, the watch is smaller than the pictures would have you believe. I wouldn't call it dainty, but it is about average size for a woman's watch. I purchased this as a gift for my fiance, and she loved it.The diamonds really stand out against the black face. Time is easy to read as well as there is an indicator for each hour. All and all, I am very pleased with this watch. It is a very suitable accessory for those who have all white gold and/or onyx jewelery."
5,More than a lamp,"The stand is very lovely, heavily weighted at the bottom and just what I needed to hang my Moroccan candle lantern on. I tossed the shade and eliminated the electrical cord and voila!--a beautiful objet d'art. I love it! As I write my candle lantern is twinkling away. It may have made a nice lamp but my use is so much more original and classier!"
2,Not well made,"The company that sold it shipped it out in a timely fashion, however the lamp was not well made."
2,Should have bought elsewhere,"I bought this watch band as a replacement for the original that came with the watch. The band looks identical and is good quality, but it wasn't what it was advertised to be. They did not send me new spring pins which would have been included had I bought this watch band direct from Wegner for the same exact price of $25.On the original Wegner packaging that came with the watch band, it said new spring pins should have been included. I did not receive these pins, and I contacted the seller to ask if it was a mistake or if they weren't supposed to be included with this sale. I did not hear a reply from them and that is disappointing. They do not seem to be concerned with customer service. I will buy somewhere else next time."
1,Won't fit watch,"This watchband has been ordered twice now and each time the connecting pins in package were too short for the intended watch. Same brand and manufacturer should easily fit the Wenger Watch, but it didn't. Local jeweler did not have a watch band to fit this watch and did not have the pins to connect it. I sent back and got a refund, but still have no watchband."
4,it's part of a set,"Amazon apparently has missed the fact that this is part two of a two-volume set, and they eveen have both volumes in their database.I only have them wishlisted now, after seeing a real copy during a two-hour visit to the engineering-science-math section of the Stanford University bookstore, where I wishlisted hundreds of dollars worth of books, mostly in math. When I purchase both volumes I'll try to give a better review."
2,A flawed treasure,"While this book by the long-time Sporting News editor is a excellent re-issue for its historic value, Sporting News (the new foreword is by Sporting News research director Stephen Getscher) should have taken the time to correct the numerous errors it contains."
2,A Pathetic Remake of the Original.,"""Pathetic,"" anemic,"" and ""emasculated"" are words to describe this sorrowful remastering. Anyone who remembers the original, powerful 33rpm recording will be disappointed with this CD. What ruins this CD is the perceptible reduction in the audio, making the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra sound more like front music in Tin Pan Alley. The other problem is the castration of the sound effects. Gone are the roar of big guns from ""Allies on the March,"" for example. Also oddly lacking are the fighter aircraft sounds from ""Marianas Turkey Shoot,"" the multiple horns and whistles from ""Ship That Pass,"" etc.,etc.,etc. Suffice to say those of us who remember the original...please pass on this CD, not worth a bucket of warm spit by comparison."
2,I'll Judge By The Other Comments,"I'll have to judge by the other comments I've read on this(these) soundtrack albums. I don't think remixing should have been done to these beautiful pieces of work. They should have kept it in the original format and that is RCA Red Seal. I still have my 3 volumes on vinyl and Volume 3 is still on the RCA Red Seal label. The other 2 volumes are good but not as good as the original. Maybe we can get onto RCA and have them re-release the original versions of these 3 beautiful volumes of music as they were originally released. After reading the comments on these CDs, I'm not wasting my time or money on them. I'll hold on to my vinyl copies. I also have them taped so I can listen to them whenever I want since I no longer have a turntable. :-("
2,Glad I read the reviews.,"I have the first 2 volumes on LP's and was very excited to see volume 1 remastered in Dolby surround. When I recieved it, I realized it was different, but came to appreciate the great sound. I came back to order volume 2, but while listening to the samples, I could not find the originals - it was because the effects had been omitted and also some selections seem to be missing or distorted. Why can't they just remaster and leave the masters alone! Wish I had volume 3 on record!"
2,"Yes, it is THAT bad","Why, why is it so difficult to reissue the originals, in full? The music is wonderful--well, if you're a fan, you know that already--but the sound effects really are laughably bad. And as the sound effects were integral to the atmosphere of several tracks, it really does matter. Now, instead of the jungle sounds that accompanied the original track, you get to listen to some house sparrows chirping and flitting cheerfully from tree to tree, as if you were sailing toy boats in the park instead of slogging through the jungles of New Guinea. If the original sound effects are missing, minimal effort from RCA could have secured at least reasonably realistic substitutes. Instead, we get this pathetic garbage. Really a shame. That second star is only because the original music is so good."
3,Second Drawer,"I think the problem with this recording is not the sound effects, as other reviewers have stated. Rather, it's that Rodgers had nine tracks' worth of Victory at Sea in him (the first nine of the original CD), but was forced by the demands of the TV series to go on writing. The results here are from fair to pretty good; they remind me of some of the lesser symphonic efforts of Haydn, Dvorak, and Prokofiev, in comparison to their masterpieces.Buy Volume 1!"
2,More victory at sea,"It's ok, but much of it was cut from the original album. I have the complete set of 33 1/3 albums,there were three, the cd is ok but lacks the original sounds put on when recorded.Sounds were added that were not originally there.It can't compare to the original."
3,do I buy or not?,"After reading all of the comments for both CDs I'm wondering if I really want to buy these 'remastered' tracks? I 'had' the entire set of 33-1/3 albums until termites found their way into the house right behind the 1850s kindling box in which all my old albums were stored standing up. By the time I discovered the little monsters, they had eaten all the album covers, record covers both paper & plastic, and even the labels off the records! Destroyed about a thousand $$ worth of records + books on a nearby shelf. Our local public radio station played Victory at Sea this PM and I just missed it. I love this music and always have. What do I do? Gotta decide. If I buy, sounds like I'll be disappointed with what I hear versus what I remember on the albums. Thanks to all who shared their thoughts."
4,Victory at Sea,Richards Rogers music from the original television series embodies the carnage and heroism of naval warfare during WW2. It won an Emmy in 1954 as best public affairs program. For anyone who has and interest in the pacific campaign this audio soundtrack is a must. Respectfully DP Miller
4,Even English Speaking Listeners will enjoy this one,"Unlike other Spanish language cd's, Juanes' songs manage to strike a cord with even those that who don't speak Spanish. I understand a little, but speak NO Spanish at all, but his diction is so clear and his tunes so catchy that you'll find yourself not only humming along every track but even picking up the words. I saw his hit video on Latin Video tv and loved it enough to go out and buy the whole cd, trusting that I would not be disappointed -- guess what....I WASN'T ! This is one you should buy."
1,HORRIBLE SELLER,I NEVER RECIVED MY ITEMS. I EMAILED THE SELLER 3 TIMES AND THEY NEVER RESPONDED. I HAD TO FILE A CLAIM.
4,UNO DE LOS MEJORES CD'S EN ESPANOL,ESTE CD TIENE MUCHISIMA MUSICA BUENA. TODO EL CD SE OYE BIEN. ME GUSTA MUCHO EL ESTILO DE JUANES Y CANTA MUY BIEN
4,Mejor que el primer disco,"Que bien...Todas las canciones son buenisimas, excepto numero doce. esta cancion no se va bien con las demas. pero este disco es excelente! compralo ya."
1,Bad,The case was completely broken and the cd had many scratches. The product was notdescribed correctly in the description
5,And I don't even speak Spanish!,This CD is fantastic. I heard it in my Spanish class and bought it the very next day. All the songs have catchy beats and you can pick up the words really quickly. It is a great buy in my opinion.
3,Yo need to go back to your roots man,"From this album, only a few songs are good. The rest are pop songs that I feel were writen only to please the record copny and sell more albums. it is easy to feel that there was not much thought in the majority of the songs. I know artists want to sell albums, but please don't forget your roots and the reason you became a musician in the first place. Please revisit some of the spects that made ""Fijate Bien"" and Ekhymosis two great Albums."
5,Can you wear out a CD?????,"This is one of my FAVORITE CD's. I keep a copy in my car and play it on my way to work -- it puts me in a better mood every time! Es Por Ti is my favorite but I enjoy the entire CD....heard this song while on vacation in Mexico and came back to Google the lyrics and find out more about the artist. Love Juanes older/newer CDs, but Un Dia Normal is still my favorite!!!!"
2,Not all as advertised,I received my order this afternoon. After opening and playing the cd I learned it was not Juanes but it is Juan Lois Guerra. The dvd is the dvd but the cd is not!!
4,Juanes el hermoso,"Vi Juanes en el tv y me gusto mucho. Luego me encontro los muestros de los cantos en el internet. pero no se vende este cd en Turquia todavia, es que le pido a mi amiga de Espana.Juanes me recuerde de Manu Chao a alguna manera. Es bueno.me gusta ""la paga"", ""la noche"" y ""a dios le pido""."
4,NICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Juanes Un Dia Normal is a great CD. I think its one of the few that I own where I could listen to the whole thing all day. Despite a couple of songs, this is a great CD. The songs I don't like, I wouldn't really say I HATE them. They aren't bad at all to be honest, in fact they are alot better than alot of Top 40 crap they play here in America. Its just that they aren't AS good as the rest of the songs, which was why I gave it a 4. My spanish teacher got me into Juanes. Thank you (name not given for privacy reasons) for getting me into this music. Its feakin awesome. Buy this CD. You won't regret it."
5,Sencillamente excellente!,"Punto y coma, la musica de Juanes es positiva, alegrante y completamente magnifica. Su bella interpretacion de ""A Dios Le Pido"" es una de las mejores canciones que he escuchado en los recientes anos."
5,mesmerizing,"Absolutely mesmerizing, this album is another great masterpiece by Digweed, right at the level of Bedrock.i recommend the listeners to listen the album in its entirety, forget about the each tracks titles , just put it on while you are driving and just focus on the musicIn this album, Digweed plays with you mind , not as much as bedrock but this one is more trancy, and more melodic (by being melodic doesn't mean its like any other cheese commercial trance, it's melodic in a digweed sense, subtle unpretencious slow to reach yet powerful at the right moment)I like disk 2- it keeps me entertained during the entire length of CD, bouncy, spacy, and very Digweed.."
3,"Disc 2 is great, disc 1 ok I guess","I dunno - there is alot of praise for Disc 1 in these reviews, but I wasn't feeling it. There are several tracks on the first disc which are downright annoying. Disc 2, on the other hand, is a very tight, very nice CD with a great theme to it. Many is the night I have chilled to disc 2 while hanging out with some friends. Overall, I say get this if you have a bug crush on Digweed, but otherwise go for something else in the GU catalog."
4,Better than the first,"I felt that this CD was so much better than his first Global Underground release. Unlike Live From SYdney, Hong Kong had a litle more pace and excitement. I strongly reccomend this to anybody who is a teneglia fan."
4,"A solid set, low on cheese but also light on flavor","I've got to say that as a John Digweed fan, this left me disappointed. Picking up where bedrock left off, Digweed eschews the typical breaks and highs (and lows) of most progressive house/trance for squelchy, deep-grooved movers that ride the line of engaging and monotonous.The set starts off strong with the remixed Cups and Overflow, then starts to slowly sink into a repetitive groove until coming back up with the strong The Banguio track and Music Saved My Life. Disc 2 has a similar formula, with fewer highs.This is still a well mixed and crafted set, and is still worth getting, but for those looking for something special, check out his other releases, or stuff by Dave Seaman."
2,Mellow Trance,"For those of you who are searching for ripping sounds, this is not the CD. Although Digweed does a good job at selecting the tunes and mixing them, this CD does not have that 'housy' beat many of us tend to find in other Global Underground CDs, like in the Nick Warren collection. This is a good CD to play while you are hosting a few guests for some drinks-and that's about it."
4,Alright but can tedious,"This is a standard release for GU. It's kind of dark, very trancy, and is not for the novice listener. It's very deep like most of Digweed's stuff but doesn't give you the vocals like L.A. did to even out and fill in some of the missing parts. If there were some vocals on this cd it would definetely have improved this mix and given the listener something to break up the constant beat that is very rarely broken up or given a break. Pick up LA instead."
5,Outstanding Genre-expanding Trance,"Digweed really comes into his own on this mix. His previous mixes have had their moments but haven't been strong overall but this one is awesome. It takes a while to get into but disc 2 has some of the best mixing that I've heard and the moment when the melody from Persuasion comes on is the most uplifting thing on record this year, unbelievable!"
5,GU: Digweed - Hong Kong is incredible. Buy it now.,"I own all of the Global Underground releases and this is definitely one of my favorites. Easily John Digweed's best mix CD, it has phenomenal energy. The tracks are dark and often quite minimal while maintaining proper dancefloor energy. If Luzon's ""Baguio Track"" and Medway's ""Flanker"" don't get you moving, then nothing will. Definitely more club-oriented than Bedrock,which was kind of meandering and clunky (though perfectly suitable for homework-music!) and that is a good thing. Do yourself a favor and snatch this up while it is cheap! (i paid $32 for it on import! and it was STILL worth it! )"
3,Tough read,"Not impressed with the style or way the book reads. It seems as though the authors are trying to make certain points, but never really do. I had to read this book for a class I was taking, otherwise I never would have read it."
5,Reader's Review,"This author has a thorough knowledge of the American Revolution. She has managed to give us a history lesson while presenting the characters in a very personal way. I looked forward to each new chapter and, hopefully, to another book."
5,Patriots cause,"""Patriots Cause"" is a wonderful historical fiction novel of the times during the American Revolution Era. It highlights the lives and spirit of the men and women during this time of Independence and Freedom in the forming of a more perfect Union. You follow Emma Geiger from childhood to adult with an unquenable spirit to help the cause at any cost even death. Kathleen A. Goodrich weaves her characters through the events of this period using actual battles and locations as an artist with a paint brush. The story continues to move and elevates the reader showing the reader the true spirit needed at this time in American's history to win the battle for Independence."
5,The pure Uk Club sound,"This cd is a cracker, it contains all the back to old skool tracks like;Brothers and sisters but also contains to great house and eurobeat tracks too...believe me when i say this is a must buy if your into that club sound that this is the cd for u...oh and by the way look out for volume three..its been released in the uk and carries one of the best songs of all time.2Brothers on the 4th floor with DREAM will come alive (what a classic)"
2,Cheap stock for sure,You get what you pay for....this is not a quality stock. Went back to the original. I was not pleased with this stock.
2,doesnt fit together without modification,"disappointed....i was looking foward to installing this on my marlin all day. the trigger assembly wouldnt fit without sanding down the inside where the trigger slides in. ok, i can live with that BUT when i went to put in my last screw which goes threw pistol grip peice, trigger and the to the gun i found no way to screw it in. yes i used the longer screw thats included, but the hole on the stock doesnt line up, so i had to re drill it. not a complete waste but you shouldnt have to do that much mod to a stock that is suppose to fit. dont waste your money,"
4,Nice stock for the money.,"I wanted something different for my .22 and this was it. There isn't much bad I can say about this stock. The only two things I could say bad is that the top piece that covers the barrel seems to come loose sometimes (but doesn't come off), and there are some burs left from where the stock was molded. I am thinking about sanding the burs off of the stock and DuraCoating it to remedy the finish. The stock feels very comfortable and doesn't affect recoil much. I would recommend this to anybody wanting to upgrade their Marlin."
5,nice up-do,"I was very excited to get this item... i have had my model 70 marlin 22 a long time and this was a great make-over for a great rifle. my wife said ""ooooh, that looks dangerous."" when she saw it. nice directions, pretty easy to accomplish... i wish if gave guidance on the snug fit and techniques for getting the trigger asembly to fit in the well. also, if you have a semi-auto clip-fed, you definatley will need to drill... i used a zip-drill with a dremmel to achieve success, but you could use a drill bit and then a metal-cutting jig saw... it doesnt need to be pretty as the magazine well plate covers the rough edges you will create (it does have a guide... make sure you cut out ALL of the area or the magazine catch wont work after assembly."
3,Suitable,"Fit was a little off requiring some adjustments. Top of forestock doesn't quite snap down. Got this to replace the wood one for a lighter carry, waterproof. OK for what I need."
4,with a little elbow grease...,"I just received this in the mail today. it says it is for marlin auto loaders with specific models in mind, but some of us own bolt actions. i am in the process of grinding out the correct grooves and holes to fit this to my classic Glenfield model 25."
2,faulty product,The plastics parts above and below the barrel don't fit together tightly. there is a gap between the two parts and it doesn't look very good. I would be interested to know if this is the case with every product? or if I just received a faulty product?
3,Marlin 60 synthetic stock,Instructions said this stock would be snug and needs a little force. My advise is to use a dremel tool to make it fit and don't force it. My rear trigger guard screw slot broke off. Stock is longer than the original wood stock to the point that my 11 and 13 year old can't use it.
2,poor quality,"completely assembled product with marlin rifle .upon completion the heat shield is a piece of crap that has no way of being secured .the muzzle end has a gap the snap in points are miss aligned and do not hold, it pops off with ease, what am i supposed to do, glue it? then how do i dissamble for cleaning? you have to cut away the prescribed area for the magazine well in order to assemble so when you find out its a piece of crap its already to late to get your money back .what a joke. pass on this junk"
5,Makes an old rifle new and fun,This stock is great. It fit on just like the directions describe and it makes an old Marlin 60 look much more modern.
3,"its ok, could not find any other stock","Since the stock that came with the firearm was a youth stock, it was kinda of hard to aim since i had to turn my head sideways. This picks up reciever or lowers the cheek so you dont have to do that. A little cheap looking & feel, would like more on the back part of the stock. And the cover does go on very well."
4,Good drop in stock for the Marlin,"This is an easy drop in stock for the Marlin. The stock was not a perfect fit for my rifle but fits well enough that I did not try to modify it. The price is good and it looks pretty cool, especially with a scope on it. Shipping was fast and overall, I am satisfied with the purchase."
4,ATI Dragonov Marlin Sniper Stock,"The ATI Dragonov sniper stock for the Marlin .22 rifle is indeed a great stock. It says that it is not for the Marlin 795, which is what I have, but it will fit it with some modifications to the stock. By laying the trigger guard on the new stock, and tracing it so that the nylon material can be countersunk to allow the trigger guard to sit into the stock is the major mods. In with that is the cutout for the magazine. It was really not a big deal. It would be best if ATI would market this stock with the statement that it does fit the Marlin Model 795 with some modifications instead of stating that it does not fit. I spent 1.5 hours doing the mods with a dremel tool and basic hand tools. It looks great and is weighted very nicely. I do recommend this stock. It looks great and feels very comfortable."
4,Works great,"Fairly simple to install. Required a little extra effort so that the trigger pull worked as it should. I had to make sure that the barrel and action was just slightly forward in the stock. If moved reward by a fraction, something in the stock was slightly binding making the trigger difficult to squeeze. Loosen the screws, move the barrel and action forward, tighten the screws real tight and you are goot to go."
5,Marlin ATI stock,"Great tactical stock and a bargain, about the only way to jazz up a model 60! Easy to install, great look!"
4,great stock for price,This is a great stock for the price. It needed some modding to fit correctly. Mainly around the trigger assembly. And the piece that fits on top of the barrel did not snap into place as well as to be expected. Taking back off to clean is alittle hard as well. But for under 50 you can't beat this stock.
3,Takes a little fitting,"After a little fitting and adjusting I got it installed. It looks great but....... Its not very functional. I have a bi-pod and RedDot on mine, when I'm laying down, the angle of the but stock is very awkward, it is hard to get a good view through my optics. I find myself having to put the top of the stock much lower on my shoulder, if this was a high caliber rifle it would hurt, but it's just a .22, so no worries. If I had it to do over I would just opt for the regular black synthetic stock, it does not look as cool as this dragunov knock off, but would be much more comfortable and functional."
1,not very good,"Installed the stock only to find, it would not lock in place on the barrel at the front of the stock. the stock is at best flimsy and too small to really be comfortable for the average size person to use and be comfortale. The stock would be more suited to a youth shooter. Very disappointed in this item.."
4,A great lieder singer in an early phase,"This recital from 1995 includes a few Schubert chestnuts, but the remainder is little-sung material--all but a few songs are very worth hearing. Compared to Quasthoff's latest CDs on DG, however, his earlier phase on RCA shows a great artist still finding his way. The voice is full, rich, and expressive, but it doesn't yet have all the colors that Quaasthoff has learned to bring out. There are occasional flashes of brilliance, moments when Quasthoff opens up and lets his voice fly.The texts by Goethe will be half the reason to buy this CD for German speakers. But even we non-speakers can be thrilled by Quasthoff's rendition of an early melodrama (D. 126) that sets Mephistopheles' temptation of Gretchen in the cathedral -- it's as gripping as anything the mature Quasthoff has done. Finally, I wouldn't say that the accompanist, Charles Spencer, is top drawer, his style being too direct and blunt. So mark this one down as a very good but not exceptional recital."
5,Fascinating to read in its own right,"Also available in a hardcover edition (0910707561, $39.95), this newly published, updated, and expanded second edition of Ted Goertzel and Ariel Hanzen's Cradles Of Eminence: Childhoods Of More Than 700 Famous Men And Women features the childhood biographies of more than 700 outstanding personalities. These sketches of the formative years of distinguished individuals reveal amazing insights into factors that can contribute to greatness, particularly in todays demanding and ever-changing world. Fascinating to read in its own right, and a wealth of anecdotal information about the youthful struggles of truly remarkable people including Alfred Hitchcock, Oprah Winfrey, Helen Keller, The Dalai Lama, Pablo Picasso, and many more."
3,Cradles of Eminence,"I expected to get excerpts from autobiographies of great people, drawing conclusions of common childhood traits shared by those greats.Instead, you get a lot of narrative and a mention of a great person. Did not have an index to read a page about each of the greats.Disappointing. I had hoped to use it to have my 12 year old son read about great people, those he could relate to in his likes/dislikes and type of learning styles."
2,Wanted: An escape from this book,The other reviewers have done a nice job summarizing this book so I'll focus on my opinion of it. Overall I found the book to be slow-paced and lacking interest. Although it is a nice historical fiction of mid-twentieth-century Britain I did not find it to be particularly interesting and would not recommend it to anyone that I know.The author's strongest ability was her ability to describe British class structure but her weakest was probably the pace of the plot line. Had there been more action and less depression among the characters I probably would have enjoyed it more.
4,Unreleased Funk,This is the best album of all the George Clinton Family Series. I recommend this for any P.Funk fan
3,Not bad for unreleased music,"While I am a big fan of George's, the family series is lacking in the Funk. There is hardly any funky bass lines worth mentioning, here. The vocals are weak and in some places very weak. Yet there is no doubt there is some funk to listen to Bubblegum Gangster and a couple of other songs are decent at the very least, for newcommers to the funk, there will be some interesting tracks. But for someone who has been a listener since the beginning, this is sorely lacking real P-funk juice. I could take this series and put a Family series of two discs that would rock the house, in retrospect. But that's just me, still a P-funk fan for life though."
2,The only thing good about this book...,"After reading this book, I must say that I was a bit disappointed. I have read the readers' reviews here on amazon, and I thought that this would be a really great manga. Even though it had some good moments, but overall it is just lacking. The characters should have been developed more, and the plot should have been better. The only good thing about this book in my opinion is that it is long, so it kept me occupied for an hour and a half."
4,Very Good,"The Dreaming is a spooky horror manga about a Victorian-style private school in a remote area of Australia. Twin teenage girls who just arrived at the school soon find there is something sinister about not only the school, but the surrounding area. What is the strange history of the school and why does one of the twins visit it in her dreams?Author Queenie Chan based the story on a famous Australian book/movie called Picnic at Hanging Rock. Hanging Rock is about a girls' school in Victorian times and the strange disappearance of three students. The movie is so well-done that most who saw it believed the fictional story to be historically true. Indeed, The Dreaming is very much like the movie, and was one of the reasons I was attracted to the book. The manga art is good, but not quite as good as the story. Chan draws backgrounds more convincingly than characters.Can't wait for volume two, coming in November 2006!"
4,Firm Pillow,"Consistency is more of a foam type than down. Although labeled Down Alternative my expectation was for it to be more flexible than a normal foam pillow. It is not. If you are looking for a firm pillow, this ones for you."
1,"# 10 I think?? Gettin tired of buyin now ,wife gettin on me...","let's see how this one works,i walk alot with my bluetooth on and i hate for party to be like """"what ,huh ,what you say""it totally pisses me off,i saw a review on the jawbone/II and was impressed after i ordered this one,i will let you all know i 've had the jabra 8010,scala over head headsets,510,350 h700,h12,n not this one among a few others"
1,Avoid using with a Motorola phone!!!! Receivers can't hear you!,"I tried pairing this headset up with 3 different phones: the Motorola RAZR V3c, RAZR V3M, and a Q. All had the same outcome, people sounded clear on my end but they couldn't hear me. The common comment was that I was in a tunnel and that I was standing 6 feet away from the mic. This headset might work for other phones but with my experiences on Moto, it's a no-go. Definitely avoid..."
3,Eh...,I have a different Motorola headset that I love so I got this one (supposedly an upgrade) for my wife. She doesn't like it at all. People are always complaining that they can't hear her. She never uses it... Waste of money.
5,Still Running!,"I purchased this product a year ago and it still works.I don't use it very often, but it comes in handy when I need it.It was very easy to pair with my Samsung Rant.Only thing I noticed, is it has a range of like 15 ft. before it gets fuzzy.But I keep my phone in my pocket so I've never had a problem."
1,very bad,after using a week speaker went out you can hear only what you saying the guy you talking to can not hear anything so very bad product sent tome waste of money
2,Uncomfortable!,"I just got this headset today and am already rather frustrated at how uncomfortable it is. The ear loop is hard plastic and inflexible. Even the large size (it comes with three sizes of ear loops) hits the back of my ear and after 30 min or so I am wanting to take it off.The slider on/off option seems pretty cool and I seem to be able to hear people okay with it but since it's uncomfortable, I can tell I am not going to want to use it. I'll probably return it and get a different one after I go to a cell phone store and try a few on."
1,Never Again,this product is terrible. the people u talk to cant hear anything you are saying. it dies very quick. please don't buy this product. i will get something better. ad the company where they sent it from sucks and they are very rude.
1,Garbage Unit,"This machine worked great for 31 days, and then suddenly the mic boom would not extend automatically. It can be pulled open, but the microphone does not work. It lasted just long enough that it could not be returned to the manufacturer. What a piece of trash."
3,Cool Features,It's cool that you can close and lock to conserve battery power but it picks up a lot of background noise
5,Love it - works great,"Easy, uncomplicated and works way better than the older model I had for so long. Arrived quickly, which was good 'cause I couldn't wait! Love having this earpiece."
1,I can't hear you!!!,"That and ""huh?"" is the most common response in using this headset after two weeks. I am giving up. I bought this because I have a Motorola Q and wanted to get a headset that would pair well. I like the connectivity consistency, and it sounds great on my end. All my callers say they can't hear me, and say it sounds like I am in a tunnel. One friend said I sounded like one of those people on 60 Minutes in the witness protection program who has their voice distorted to protect their identity! I'd suggest you stay away from this one...I'm done with it."
3,An entirely pointless H- entry.,"Thinking this was an upgrade for the H700, I unwittingly bought it. It's inferior in every way. The H700 takes just a second to connect to my HTC P3600 from when I open the flap, whereas the H800 takes over 10 seconds from pushing the power/spring button. The H800 is larger, heavier etc. But at least the call quality on both headsets is identical. Stick with the H700."
3,hurts when wearing,"it sounded real clear, but it hurt when i wore it. used the different size ear clips but it still was uncomfy."
2,Too Heavy,It`s too heavy. Lousy recption and transmission anywhere except in a very quiet environment. Everything esle is ok. Seems that what it`s worst at is what people want the most. My HS820 moto is the best of the last 5 bluetooth headsets I`ve tried and it`s almost 5 yrs. old.
5,Works great with my iphone,"I had 3 diiferent bluetooth devices that I paired with my iphone, but I kept having people tell me they could not hear me. A call to Apple and I was impressed they recommended three or four diiferent bluetooth devices, including their own. One of those was the Motorola H800. It works well, no complaints from people on my iphone about not being able to hear me. It is comfortable to wear. My only beef (small one)is battery life is not as good as my previous Moto Bluetooth, but hey, I like it anyway."
4,Stylish And Sophisticated,"Sleek, Sexy, and Sophisticated. The design is flawless, Extremely comfortable fitting and the style is very modern without being overbearingly flashy, there is really alot of detail in the visual designs that are only visible by eyes (black on black mechanical-esque designs) The sound quality is pretty good, and at 17.95 (100 off retail) you cannot beat this headset"
2,Delivered with faulty battery,"The unit had a faulty battery when I received it. The seller offered to replace it, but Motorola replaced it with an H555 under their 1 year warranty program."
2,my thoughts on the 800,"I purchased one of these because it was on sale and it sounded like a great design.It is a great design. The push button with automatic end slide out is great. Being able to shut it completely off so the battery lasts forever is great. The fit is solid and it holds well. The pair up with the phone is fast enough to catch the ring before it goes to voice mail. Like I said, the design is great.The hardware is not so good. It stopped working 2 months after I bought it. No warning, just won't pair up anymore, on 4 different phones. It happened while it was sitting on my desk, just stopped. One day working, one day not.Great idea, poor implementation."
4,Works like a charm,I was able to sync up the headset very easily with my RAZR. The headset is very easy to use. Voice quality is good. The only downside that I have observed so far is that battery drains pretty quickly.
3,Too much background noise!,This product is easy to use however the background noise my callers hear is terrible!! You have to be in a quiet room or not driving to get the best use. Which is not good since I bought it to drive with.
3,New Age just okay,Music is just okay. It sounds like it is trying to be Mannheim Steamroller. Good just not great. Needs to strike out on its own.
1,A record company that wanted a piece of the pie.,"Yes... This is rap. Untalented girls singing out of key to heavy-synth from a record company that wanted a quick entry into the growing popularity of the 80's rap market. Yuck... It's cheap sounding and each track is very repetitive. This music is horrible and each track makes me want to barf. Sorry, but that is my opinion of this CD."
4,Dope!!!!!,"This is a dopest album I have bought in years! They are THE original female rappers!!!! Get the album, it's worth the money!"
3,Women in rap,This album doesn't have great lyrics but has some nice beats. I think women would love their music more than men.
3,Pretty Good,this was Tight Back In the day.Supersonic was the JAM!They Had their Own Thing.Overall it hasn't aged on a Whole that Good but it does Have Moments.
2,I EXHALE HARD ON THIS ONE,"like everybody else, i got this for SUPERSONIC. after that, oh boy. why they did a diss record i do not know. they got dissed too now...........check out roxanne shante's WACK IT. funny diss record from the marley marl cd from 1988............the one with SYMPHONY on it. nostalgia cubed."
1,"AFTER SUPERSONIC, WAY OUT THEY WENT!","The ironic thing about the track ""Way Out"" which I guess was a follow-up to their one hit wonder ""Supersonic,"" as they proceeded to bash (or diss) other rappers, in many ways they were talking about themselves, because after that, well JJ Fad was over before it started. Even though three years later they release another album after their 1988 debut, called: ""Not Just Another Fad,"" the reality is that, they were nothing more, but a FAD!!! Because no one bought their second album."
1,A very disappointing approach to Chemistry,"Kotz's Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity is a very disappointing textbooks. As a student using this textbook, I found myself highly confused due to the poor explinations as well as well as how unorganized the format of the book is. If it was not for the fact that I had taken Chemistry earlier I would not have understood half of the material that was taught to me by the book. I am highly disappointed in the textbook."
3,Get 4th edition if you can,"4th edition of this book was quite superior. Well written and coherent. Upon changing the edition from 4th to 5th, editors, it appears, have torn out pieces of text in a random manner. The only new material added were some new color pictures (yeah, let's use as much graphics and color as possible, that'll drive up the price of the book). The purpose of such ""editing"" escapes me; the result is an inconsequent and disjointed text which is very hard to digest.If you're getting this book for a class, see if you can use the 4th edition. If you are getting it for your personal reading, definitely get the 4th edition. Chemistry doesn't change that much."
1,Is this book or hell!,"I really liked chemistry. I thought it was fascinating. But this book completely made me loathe it. You won't understand a thing in this. It explains one thing and when you think you are getting the hang of it, it skips the whole thing and goes in a completely confusing way to a completely confusing topic. The formulas, which are considered to be really simple are given in the most complicated way, and there are times I really threw the book at the wall out of frustation. Don't ever buy this book. You will be doomed. Buy anyone's else. Nothing could be horrible than this. After reading the other reviews, I think, my review is justified.Thank you."
3,Very clear explanations... but lots of other info missing,"I bought this book last week, and loved the first part of it. David Pond has described all 7 chakras quite clear in this book, but I'm a bit disappointed about the lack of practising information. I mean... yeah sure, I knew what the Heart Chakra was after my first ""exercise"" and I've also tried that Yoga position, but it's more theory than practise. Too bad!"
2,Chakras for beginners?,"I didn't like this book much at all. Even though the author might know his chakras inside out, he failed to motivate me to work on them. Too much new agey sweetness of light for me, sorry. I regret buying this book."
5,Very good,A very good book for people interested in the chakras. Had some very practical things you can do in daily life to help balance your chakras. The essays were also excellent.
4,A good introduction to chakras,"This book is a good introduction to the idea of chakras and what they do. As with any study, one benefits from more than one perspective on the subject. I found Wheels of Live by Anodea Judith and Vibrational Medicine for the 21st Century by Dr.Ricahrd Gerber to be helpful as well."
2,Writing is no great,"It's an alright book, The writing is not great. Wordy and choppy and bland, kind of dry. Gives you an idea of what chakras are all about but lacks enthusiasm."
2,chakras,"It is informational only, not offering practical user advice on how to incorporate practices into one's daily life."
4,Connection to the Universe,The clear and simple structure of the book helped as an awakening to my being. Now I am more aware through my feelings and emotions about imbalances on the chakras and how to balance them. the essay section was very enlightening for my being. The exercises and meditations section was very helpful to balance the chakras. This book has become one of my bed-side reference source. I feel this book as a friendly advisor in my journey through earth.
2,Not enough Mancini tunes,"I first realized the brilliance of Mancini when I heard a Charlie Haden/Pat Metheny rendition of ""Two For The Road"". I went in search of hearing more Mancini tunes. Sadly after I bought this CD I discovered that only 4 of the 15 tunes are written by Henry, ""Two For The Road"" being my favorite. The non-Mancini tunes are good and showcase his expert skill of arranging but I wanted ALL Henri."
2,Could Have Been So Much Better,"I was so excited to read this new book to my 2 1/2 year old adopted son, but the farther I read, the more disappointed I became. I think the author's (Jonathan London) choice of words in explaining adoption were VERY poorly chosen. When Katie asks about her ""real"" mother, I just about lost it. Mr. London needs to understand that the adoptive parents ARE the REAL mom and dad. In relating this story to small children he could of at least used real and relevant words like ""birth mother/birth parents.""Adopted children can be confused enough as it is, but using this misleading language is totally unnecessary."
3,Nice story,"""A Koala for Katie"" has been great for our daghter. . .we bought it when she was three. In it Katie wants to be reassured about why her ""real"" mother didn't want her and finds comfort in ""adopting"" a stuffed Koala at the zoo and role-playing as the Koala's mother. My daughter enjoys role-playing, so this is right up her alley.I will say, however, that in trying to keep with ""proper"" terminology, I didn't care for the author's us of the term ""real mother"" when Katie asks her mom why her ""real mother"" didn't want her. I actually went through and use white-out and changed it to ""birth mother"" for the sake of consistency, especially since our daughter is at the age where she's trying to distinguish between ""real"", ""birth"" and who I am, and I am her ""real"" mother. That would be our only complaint about this book."
2,Too small for thicker mats,"I have a slightly thicker mat and this bag was too small. The mat wouldn't fit at all, so I returned it and purchased a Bean yoga mat bag instead (also available on Amazon), which I love."
4,good yoga bag,"a little tight squeeze to get the mat in...don't see how you can carry additional things like cell phone, water, etc like the description says but good sturdy bag."
3,not that large,"The bag was lovely,nicely constructed, beautiful color, however it did not fit my thick yoga mat. It would only hold a thin one."
3,Yoga Tote,"I can't say this yoga mat is any more special than any other but it was the right price (on sale) and, since I often leave my mat at the yoga studio, its color lets me pick it out from the piles of other students' mats. Oh and it washes well too."
4,"Works, but has some flaws.","It's a Gaiam bag and I have a Gaiam mat, so I assumed it should fit perfectly. If the zipper was just a little longer it would be perfect, it feels like I'm going to rip the bag squeezing the mat in. Other than that, it's a really nicely made bag!"
3,Almost perfect,"I didn't see the reviews on this bag warning about the size, unfortunately. I ordered a thick mat with it and what a struggle to make it fit the opening! Shipping is too much to warrant returning. The length of the bag is fine, but the length of the opening is too small. Also the color is nice, but not ""sage"" which I take to be greyish green. It's more like an attractive yellowish green. If your mat is thinner and more flexible (meaning you can bend it to get it in the bag) it should work for you. The zipper and pull are sturdy and the mesh feature is more aesthetic than functional--because if your mat needs to air out, it won't if its rolled on itself. Generally well made, but your thick mat will also need to be tightly rolled to squeeze in. Bag could use an extra inch or two in the length and girth to work for most people."
3,Great but...,"This is a great mat bag, especially being eco conscious, but my standard size yoga mat is a bit difficult to put into it because the zipper and length of the bag is not quite long enough. Another inch longer would make it more manageable."
5,Sharp R-520JW Microwave,"Absolutely the best microwave ever. Easy simple straight forward controls and so easy to use. Powerful 1200 watts. Turntable and probe.Easy one touch sensor reheat gets food heated perfectly, even in the center without drying out the outsides. Amazon had the best price once again."
3,EQUINOX!,"I rate this movie 3 stars, not because of it's great writing, acting or special F/X. No, I give it 3 stars because of the fond memories, like an old friend you see once in a while and always glad you did! All the viewings of this movie I have seen in the theaters. In the early '70's when they still had double features. This most times was the first movie. I haven't seen this movie in a long, long time and would love to own it, but not for 25 bucks!!!! The most I'll pay on a good day is maybe 5 bucks and that's pushing it!!!!Funny I remember so much of this movie. Even the KFC bucket they had in their little picnic scene! LOL! Anyway, a great movie to watch on those cold nights when your all alone, so no one will make fun of you!"
1,Second worst movie ever made . . .,". . . right down there with Plan 9 from Outer Space. It looks like it was made by some college kids with their hand-held home movie camera on a Saturday afternoon at the local hiking trail. I don't know which was worse: the script, the dialogue, the acting, the fashions, or the creepy guy who tried to plant a drooling, slobbering open-mouthed lip-lock on the camera lens. EEEW!"
1,Equinox,This movie was very campy and was not worth paying over $20.00. Acting was somewhat amatuerish so buyer must surely beware.
2,"Cheesy, But Not In A Good Way","Equinox is somewhat of a minor classic, and is part of the Criterion Collection. I have no idea why, as I found it to be just as bad as a lot of the movies that have been ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater. Cheesy, and not in a good way."
2,"You WANTA love it, but...","...but it's just amateurish and BAD: non-actors, incomprehensible script, EXTREMELY cheesy special effects. It's a disservice to the REAL low-budget gems - like EVIL DEAD or HALLOWEEN - to praise a movie this unfulfilled and unfulfilling. Kudos to everyone involved for trying to make a $6500 movie - if only it were any good at all. But it's not."
4,Looked for this movie for years.,"I remember being a boy when I watched this movie for the first time. I really thought it was a 'cool scary movie'. Equinox is also a great 'Scrabble' word!Although I would have been happy with just the movie, this criterion edition has lots of extra spedcial features that make it all the more interesting. In fact, this is why I am giving it 4 stars - if it were just the movie I would give it 3. One really has to be a fan of the movie to purchase this edition, but it's well worth it. I really enjoyed seeing the movie again.Equinox is a movie about the balance of good and evil. It has some intense imagery. The special effects of the movie are a bit on the 'corney' side, but with a little imagination I still think it's a cool movie."
4,6500 bucks!!!,"that's right, apparently this film was budgeted by some college kid's beer money so you really have to appreciate the passion that had to have gone into the film. and it really does have all the ingredients and feel of a classic cult horror film. love it!!!"
2,Ummmmm.....no.,"I am a big Paul Zindel fan, and I hate to give a two star review, but compared to all of his other books, I can't stand this one. It has a nice idea, but the way it is written, in Diary form, and how whiny Eugene seems, it just bothers me. I found it to drag on. I'm sorry Paul if you read this. Aside from this one, I think all of his other books are amazing and wonderful."
2,Slippery Little Thing,I got this unit because they told me it had better reception than most. Well it does get static in it when I get away from the phone itself. Also the on button slides into on while it is in my purse. I am always running down the battery that way. I have had several people say it is hard to hear me when I am using this device.I think the only positive thing about this piece is that I got it in a bright redish pink color which makes it easy to find on the bottom of my purse.
1,PFS,The H550 paired up very easily with my Motorola e815 but it was all downhill after that. It would not understand any of the voice commands and insisted upon asking if I wanted to send a text message. My Motorola H850 is far superior though I've had some problem with being heard on the other end 2which is why I tried the H550.
2,Bluetooth Headset H550,This product has been kinda disappointing. Will be maybe 2 foot from phone and still lose the signal.
3,Typical Motorola product,Nothing really specially about this headset. You walk away more than 5 feet or put your phone in the opposite pocket of your ear and it gets bad. It's pretty comfortable to be wear as usual and teh volume is good.
1,Shipped Broken,This headset did not work. I had to call Motorolla to have them replace it under their warranty.
1,Very fragile,"It was okay when it worked. I had the headset about a month before it fell onto the ground when I bent over. It was dead after that, and inspection (it opens easily enough) showed a teeny tiny plastic lever that operates the power switch broke. I ordered a replacement H550 (it was cheap enough) and the replacement also didn't turn on... the same lever was broken."
2,Heavy and unreliable,"The bluetooth sounded good before I bought it. At first, it was working well but I have noticed that now on multiple occasions it stops being connected to my phone. I have to mess around with it and the phone to get it to work again. One time its blue light stayed on despite the device being off and it didn't work. I'm not sure how it started working again. It also is not a good fit for my ear with any of the three rubber ear holders. Overall, I would not recommend this bluetooth headset."
1,Waste of money,"I'm in the Navy on nuclear submarines and I'd heard about a new STAIND DVD hitting the stores before my most recent deployment. Before I left I'd heard that the band wanted to add more content and make it a dual-DVD set which pushed the release date back to 1st Quarter 2002. I got back from my deployment and in my excitement, mistook the Stained: Tainted DVD as that product.This DVD is a huge letdown in every way. No music from the band, shady combinations of home video quality and black & white photography, cheesy interviewers with Springfield DJs who's half-sister's, brother's, nephew's cousin used to deliver Chinese take-out to the band, etc.My ONLY consolation for my fellow STAIND fans out there is the comfort of knowing that STAIND is soon to release THEIR official 2-disc DVD set very soon. Keep the faith."
1,buying this would be a big mistake,"That DVD is such a disgrace. It was so bad that it was insulting. It had no real material, they interviewed people who were unrelated to Staind, and pieces of information given in the video I later found to be incorrect. This was absolutely terrible. Please do not buy this. I lost ...money on this... and gained nothing from it what-so-ever.I was totally looking forward to watching a wonderful and informative dvd... but this was quite the opposite. I absolutely love Staind, but this was just a sad attempt at making something related to them so people would buy it.. (or so it very much seems)."
2,Many examples in CD are not working,"I have tried to unzip the examples come with the CD but many of that not functioning especially for chapter 4, .Net Remoting and chapter 5 XML Web Services.I have sent the error to the author but without any reply for months."
3,Excellent for Experienced people who want to review for exam,"By looking at the other reviews I can tell their looking for a book which gives them everything they need to pass the test. The book would have to be 3x as long to explain everything in the .NET Framework, etc. This touches all the topics. Although I don't agree with all the answers to the example questions, it is good enough to use for preparing for the test if you have actually used these technologies before you picked up the book.I give it 3 stars because there is no Eratta available at the Osbourne website, etc. There are errors in the book, but I have never bought one where there were not."
2,Wish I could be more positive,"I read the other reviews about the typos and example code errors but thought I could handle it, boy was I mistaken... I spent all day today trying to get through 2 chapters (with the examples) and I am so frustrated, what a waste of a day. I'm not sure what I'll do, I guess look at the example code on the CD instead of working through them on my own, not exactly my preferred way of learning...I'm going to play Half-Life and try to get rid of some stress.Good Luck,A.S."
3,Work great ... except for the oiler.,"I thought there may have been something wrong with the oiler until I read all of the other reviews that state the same thing. You have to keep oiling the chain with an oil can because the silly pump oiler, which is just a rubber bulb, does not put any pressure on the oil and it just kind of sits there. I cut for about 6 hours and did not use any oil out of the oil reservoir. The saw itself, however, works great. I don't see any problem with the way the chain tightens or the cover fits or anything else. It all works fine and looks right to me. You just have to think a little about what fits where. The saw has a lot of power and zips through wood like a champ. I used it and abused it and so far it has held up fine. I just hate having to oil the chain every time I start a new log. I would not buy another one just for that reason. In fact, I am still thinking about taking it back, if I can get by with it."
1,garbage!!,"I bought this saw several years ago and it did okay for about a year, then, all of a sudden, the motor burned up! I had used it very little and was rather surprised since I take good care of my stuff. I decided that since the bar and chain were still in excellent shape I would buy another one. What a mistake!! After cutting less than 1/2 cord of wood the motor burned up! Needless to say, I won't be getting another one!!"
2,waste of money,I used it slowly on a few 3-4 inch trees and the gear inside strips rendering it useless. I have bought at least 3 of these because they were cheap and I keep thinking Ill find a way to replace the weak link(plastic gear). so far no good. spend more as this is a waste.Too Cheap!
4,Rmeington chain saw chain,"I have had this saw for several years and when it was time to replace the chain I read on the side of the saw that it takes a 16 inch by 41cm. At Lowes I found an Oregan S54 which said on the box it was that size. It it was a little too short and would not fit. Here on Amazon they are selling an Oregan S56 spare chain for the saw. On the Oregan box it says it is a 16 inch by 40cm. That Oregan S56 fits the saw perfectly and must be pretty common because they had a lot of them in stock. Also the Oregan S56 box says it is for Remington saws. $20 with tax at Lowes here in Indiana.Yes, it's like many of the reviews have said, on my saw, the oiler leaks when setting and does not feed enough ""bar"" oil. I put some thinner 15-40 oil in it and it over oils a little. Having owned high priced top of the line quality gas saws, I think for the money and home use it's a very good saw."
3,electric chainsaw,"I have no idea what the chain saw is like. I have not used it. It is a gift for one which I burnt up trying to saw a tree...The blade was caught in an undercut and I tried to get it loose, but wound up burning up. This mearly was a replacement. This may not be the type of survey you will want the masses to read. :)"
3,Cheap disposable chainsaw.,"I've had this chainsaw for almost three years putting it through WAY more abuse than it is built for, and it finally died on me this year.First of all, the oiler is garbage. You will get oil EVERYWHERE except on the chain.The tension constantly needs adjustment, and is a pain to adjust. Loosen two bolts (with wrenches), adjust a fiddly little screw, check it, retighten the bolts, and hope that it didn't shift. That should keep you going for about 20 minutes, when you'll have to do it all over again. Incidentally, the tensioner bracket is made of cheap plastic, and is what eventually broke on my saw.But at the end of the day, it's got a remarkable amount of power (more than I expected from an electric chainsaw), is light, well-balanced, and did a lot of cutting for the price. My new saw will be a big step up, but this one stood up far better than I expected."
2,Chain jumps off the the guide every 30 minutes,"I have had this chainsaw for over 2 years now, and it definitely is headed to the trash heap. It worked well in its first 4 months, and even now, this 16-inch electric has a the horsepower for the homeowner's needs. But as others have commented, this Remington leaks oil. And in the past 10 months, the chain will jump off the guide every 30 minutes, which makes for a lot of wasted minutes. I do not recommend this electric chainsaw at all."
2,Works Graet For Awhile,"It died today. The motor burned out! Leaks oil continuously by design. Very, very noisy. Too bad it apparently did not have a 50 cent thermal overload switch to prevent it from burning up"
2,Remington Chainsaw #107624-02,This saw is too heavy and too powerful to use for carpentry which is why I purchased it. It is great for cutting up firewood though. The drawback that I have encountered is the manual oiling system. Some reviewers say they get too much oil; I don't get enough. During one use I had to pump it more than 100 times to get oil on the chain!
3,Good saw,"However lubricating oil easily leaks from the oil compartment. Other than that, it works well."
5,Very Good Saw,"It's a good saw for the money: 3 hp and 16"" can handle most jobs. It does what you what it to do as long as you don't mind the cord. You don't finish smelling like 2 cycle oil and gas. Keep the blade out the dirt and you should be all set. Used a lot less bar oil than a gas saw."
2,Wondering where my videos are,I have not yet recieved Vol 1 or Vol 4 in this series. it has been over a month.
3,A King's Breezy Journey,"A breezy read through the silent era and golden years of Hollywood. Vidor was a great director who worked skillfully in silent films and talkies, his book chronicles the journey. Some valuable nuggets but not as in depth and cutting as you would want. Vidor was a gentleman and gracefully avoided naming names or pointing fingers. If your a fan of old movies and you enjoy reading bios this is a must read, but there are many others to start with."
3,Perfect except for ankle straps,"I ordered these last year. Everything about the shoe was great, except for the ankle straps were much too short. I have a fairly slim ankle, so I believe this was a defect of the sandal. My husband helped me punch a hole to make them fit and they were perfect and very comfortable. If I had thicker ankles, the strap might not have been long enough to do that. If it weren't for the strap problem, my review would go up to 4 stars. These are very comfortable, and actually more attractive than they appear in the photo. I hope the manufacturer has fixed the strap problem."
4,EVERYBODY LISP NOW!,"This is great for the car. However, by the second tape you will notice that everyone is lisping and then it gets funnier and funnier. How could they put a book on tape with a lisping lewinsky? It's a dream come true. Buy two copies and send one to a friend as a gift.My favorite part was when Monica asked everyone to stop referring to her as Ms. lewinsky cause ""I'm just 25."" When she's told that for the rest of her life she was always be Ms. Lewinsky, she volunteers, ""Not if I get married!""In reality it's all sad, this brave woman has endured more than any of us will have to in a lifetime. She deserves everything that she can get. She's a true survivor. Viva Lewinsky!"
3,Earth to Matthew,"Earth to Matthew is about a 12 year old boy completing the sixth grade.He has a sister who bosses him,and parents who embarrass him. In ecology he learns that changes in the ecosytem can have lasting effects on the enviroment. Then he is assighed a recycling project that becomes not just interesting to him but very important. Matthew is taking sixth grade more seriousy, Matthew also learns that small changes in feelings can make a difference.Exspecaly when he looks at his friend Jill. Jill makes him feel funny, when ever she says earth to Matthew. this book is great. Paula Danziger makes good books but they could be much better."
5,Tea Time Friends : Friendship collection,"It is a beautiful small book.I do love the style,images and phrases.It is a wonderful inspiration for me .If you love Debbie and tea you will love this book."
3,Tea Time Friends,"Tiny book, tea lover's delight. Would go great in a little basket made just for a special friend. I love Debbie Mumm books and the art work in this little guy is up to pare with her large books."
4,what do u need 2 know ??,George Bloomer really takes the time to answer relationship questions that most christian pastors and teachers would not or could not answer. These answers are scripturally based and easy to apply to ones life. This book is definitely a must read if you have questions and want Biblical based answer to todays's relationship questions.
5,Conniff's tribute to the 70's!,"One of the talented musical arrangers is Ray Conniff, hands down in my opinion. This collection proves that in these selections of songs popular in the early 1970s. I especially enjoyed his renditions of Dueling Voices and the theme from 2001:A Space Odyssey! A nice two fer set of Conniff's best!"
4,enjoyable but limited,The games run and play well. There are only 5 versions of dominoes to choose from. It will not keep track of your victories and losses. Background music is anoying. It does have three different games that are not found on the hoyle board game software.
1,works in slow motion only,Works in slow motion only...Distributor will not issue refund because the shrink wrap has been opened...Duh
4,lovely,"Very nice video. Good production values. Good content. It would be nice to know that you need a pattern to go along with it. She's very precise with her measurements sometimes, then neglects to even mention a measurement in other section. but overall enjoyable and very clear about how to make the doll. the gallery of finished dolls is soooo cute, as is the end where the children are playing with them."
3,Lacking,I was disappointed with this DVD. I didn't feel there was enough content to satisfy all my questions. Since purchasing this DVD I've learned a lot more about the construction of a Waldorf doll and feel this DVD is lacking.
3,A DOUBLE PACKAGE: LIBERAL AND BLASPHEMOUS. waste of money,"I bought this DVD because there were alot of Carlin tapes and going fast. It turned out to be sacreligious, mean-spirited, liberal, and anti-america. If it weren't for the bit about ""keeping America alert"" I would have taken it back. MAYBE worth a rental if your EXTREMELY tolereant about disgusting humour and cursing."
4,George Carlin-What am I doing in New Jersey?,"A very good comedy performance from one of the leading comedians of our past 50 years. Georges' unique insight, is put to words that our mothers would be horrified to learn we listened to, but yet, if used differently, would be proud to say that we were so intellecutally wise. The views that George presents, make you wonder why you weren't paying more attention in the first place, but with your ensuing laughter comes the realization that nothing is perfect, and we can't change the whole world overnight, but by us feeling better we can make a difference-starting within."
5,Mind blowing theory about our past.,Great theory about our past and possible visitors to our planet. Very entreating to this Star Trek Geek. I hope it's true.
5,Ancient Aliens Season 4,"Some people thought this was just a ""rehash""...of course it (as others) had some repeat of information but more, to me, as a form of reintroduction or refresher. Since I don't have computer chips implanted in my brain yet, I didn't mind this, but they also had new information too. More to enjoy. Please see my review of season 1, as most applies to this season 4 too. Lots of good information."
4,Ancient Aliens: Season Four,"This is an interesting History Channel, whether it's believable or not is debatable, but it is thought provoking. And either way I have learned some ancient history."
4,"Worth the time and money, but...","I've been a fan of this show since season one and I have to admit I find the evidence more compelling than that of religious teachings or school book history, however, there seems to be a trend of repetition throughout the seasons. The show has definately opened my eyes to the posibility that our previous teachings haven been less than truthful and that we've been manipulated from our species birth. It's caused me to do alot of my own reading and research into mankind's origins and our leaps through our time on planet earth thus far. And I suppose that my own research has now eclipsed the shows ability to wow me. Many of the episodes in season four have been done in previous seasons and I fear that the show may have run it's course. I don't regret owning the series by any means, but the earlier seasons and far superior in content."
5,Ancient Aliens Fan,Bought this for a birthday gift for my brother; he loves it. It was delivered very promptly.Very good quality.
5,It good,"We cant stop watching this show we love itWe laugh and wonder if these guys may be right, but no seriously its a fun watch for us."
5,Very Interesting Series,"I really love Ancient Aliens and look forward to each season coming out on DVD (as I stopped watching TV in 2007). The only thing I was disappointed about season 4 is that it seemed like there were few episodes. But it is a great and interesting series, that asks more questions and gives possible explanations. I hope the show continues."
1,Admit it. You want to be fooled. Don't you.,"So. Because ""the local media reported more than 1,000 UFO sightings over the inundated shoreline"" following the 2011 tsunami, that deserved serious speculation that the sightings had anything to do with extraterrestrials. Fine. If I were one of this series' producers, I too would have entertained and offered those thoughts; how else would I have profited (much less have gotten my pilot episode financed at all) if I had offered more likely explanations for what may be observed during and following natural events, such as - in the case of the tsunami - the UFOs actually being the likely unprecedented number of news media and rescue team aircraft that were sent aloft to investigate the disaster sites. Plain and reasonable answers are SO boring... and unprofitable."
3,"Im a huge fan, but..","Now it seems like they are really reaching... I have watched and own all of the first 3 seasons.. I love this show!!! Season 4 is lacking.. It goes over already covered subjects... the first 2 episodes are basically all about the same thing, The Mayan doomsday stuff, which they have covered pretty extensively in the other seasons... I hate to say it because I love this show so much, but I think they are running out of subject matter.... I hope not.."
2,Meh,"Keep in mind I am not a 'believer', but am non the less intrigued by this topic.Season 1: was very good.Season 2: not so much, but still OK for the most part. (a couple of the episodes were, well, stretching it even for this topic).Season 3: had a couple of 'decent' episodes, but was now a bit weary about whether or not to buy Season 4 when or if they released it.Season 4: hmmmm, how do I put this...buy only if you are a die hard fan.Season 5: don't think i will bother buying it, if they even choose to insult us by releasing it. i think they have gotten as much milk from this cow as they can get"
3,Goofy and Fun To Watch,"If you like goofy conspiracy theory shows, then you're gonna have fun watching this one. The experts interviewed are goof balls, but have interesting theories."
3,Not Their Best Work...,"My husband & I love the Ancient Aliens Series, and also own the first three series on DVD, but this season was rather disappointing. I think they are starting to run out of material and stretch too much, and it compromises the quality of the program and the ancient astronaut theory. You'll have to purchase this DVD to complete your collection, but be warned that it isn't their best work by any means."
4,Love this kinda stuff,"As with every season I hope they don't run out of material, this season was good, but not as good as the first three, but still glad I purchased it."
1,Had I seem more would have passed this one up,"Almost every project in this book is machine stitched. Had I been able to flip through the entire book and not just a small section (with such small pictures) I would have passed this one by. The box featured on the cover is a horror when seen up close and I am sad to say is the best of the lot. Judging by the index I'd thought this book would feature a variety of styles, not so here. Every project in this book consists of a bunch of random fabrics sloppily pieced together and haphazardly machine stitched with very little care to creating something aesthetically pleasing. I've already placed this in the rummage sale box. Enlarge your viewer and take the time to really look at the cover....."
5,Hauntingly beautiful memoir by a writer who feels like your best friend,"Louise Dickinson Rich can tell the most ordinary stories in ways that nearly always contain at least a touch of the eternal. This book is about her adventures staying in a rural area on the Maine coast. Written in the 1950's, it doesn't seem dated to me (though I'm from then too). Memorable characters and a vivid sense of place make this a wonderful read. I also recommend her other books highly."
4,The required owners manual,".If you own a Sportster made in the years covered by this book, you need this book.Buying this book and using the tools you already have (you do have and know how to use hand tools...right?) you will save a lot of money doing your own basic maintenance and some not so basic stuff. Even if you just use the manual to tell your wrench what is wrong.This is also very helpful if you plan on customizing your ride. Mine is now a bar-hopper. It helps in selecting parts that will fit your ride, by knowing what parts are stock and what after market parts will work. Buying parts that don't fit is an expensive lesson."
2,author needs to stick to simple home repairs!,Contents seem to be a general overall copy of other ferret books that were a lot better than this one. Author Karen Dustman would be better off sticking to her incredibly simple home repairs. Anyone who would show a ferret stalking a chicken must be incredibly simple!
4,A rousing naturalist adventure,"It's a great shame that The Pink-Headed Duck is out of print. Anyone who is interested in vanished species (what attracted me in the first place), combined with heavy-duty hiking/traveling to find them, should find much in Nugent's forceful tale."
3,Acceptable adventure,"With a title like this, I just had to pluck it out of the bargain bin.Although a worthy travelogue into unfamiliar parts of India, Bhutan and neighboring areas, there seems to be something missing in the overall scheme of things, and it is not just the duck.While attempting to track down the elusive bird, we do learn of the many myths, legends and cultures of these regions, which is enlightening.Perhaps too much emphasis on the political. Expected more high adventure."
1,Holmes 2 cool,"Very satisfied in receiving the Holmes fan before the scheduled date.The fan was very easy to put together and take apart.The noise level was too loud. It does not tilt more than a inch and oscillates only 5"" left and right of center.I had to return this item.I do not recommend this fan."
1,"Plodding, hoping, and learning","I bought a secondhand copy of Claude and Madeleine for 180 baht, US$5.50 at the Soi Diana Book Shop in Pattaya, Thailand and can sell it back for half price. It barely holds my interest. The characters are uninteresting.I'm plodding through this book, hoping it may get better and learning a bit of history."
3,Celtic Legends/Irish Legends,Actually more of a historic overview of some of the more famous celtic leaders. A portion at the end was devoted to a short discussion of Irish legendary figures.
5,So comfortable that I brought one indoors,"This lounger is so comfortable that I replaced a crumbling armchair with one ""temporarily"". Now our living room will get at least one more--in summertime, you can't beat the coolness of relaxing on mesh. It's a great reading chair in reclining position. Then you can straighten it up, grab your computer, take a few notes, and push back to recline, all with minimal effort.After playing with our LaFuma loungers, my sister raced home and ordered some for her family. BTW, I put my LaFumas in the garage when winter comes.The long version of the Lafuma mesh recliner was the only option when I bought a pair two years ago. Now most of the Lafuma recliners offered are only 70"" long--if you are tall, be careful to get a long one."
4,Tempos a little on the slow side,"On the whole this is a nice collection of piano music just not a very balanced mix. For me, Cliburn's tempos on this CD tend to be a little too much on the slow side especially for pieces such as the Turkish March. Most of the selections on this CD are meant to be played at slower tempos but it seems that they all get the broad tempo treatment. Listening to this CD all the way through started out nicely but became a little tedious toward the end. I may be a Philistine but I prefer the selection and tempos of Phillip Entremont's collection of popular works on the SONY CD 'World's Best-Loved Piano Pieces'. This doesn't mean that I don't like Cliburn. I cherish his recordings of the piano concertos of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Beethoven and Schumann. If you like your piano music well articulated but more drawn out in tempo join the other 5 star raves and buy this CD."
5,An exquisite recording...read on!....,"Contains a masterful rendition of Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", which happens to be one of my favorite classical pieces -- I have a smooth-jazz-pop-dance version of this tune on my own album, ""Classy Cool: Classical Favorites, Made Cool"" (Google keyword ""Motionizer"" to find it)"
3,Photo wrong; Raspberry is better than Grape,"Eh, the music was decent, but if I had only one of the 3 in the series (Grape, Orange, Raspberry), I'd choose the Raspberry.As an aside, the picture here is (was, if it's since been corrected) is for a Moby Grape album, not the God-Prints Great Grape album, but the item was for the God-Prints album."
4,The eagle has landed again...,"This time around reduced to two original members,Saxon have managed to truly recapture the magic of their early albums.Rawness and their traditional grooves,some electronic treatments,all lent a helping hand to this excellent new album."
2,A Mixed Bag,"First, let me say I am a huge Saxon fan. In fact, Saxon was the first heavy metal band I ever saw in concert way back in 1985. But as much as I anjoy their music, this album was a major let down. Biff Byford's trademark vocals are obscured behind a wall of guitars that offer little to challenge the ear. If that isn't bad enough, there isn't a single song that makes you want to sing along or offers a memorable hook like Saxon's earlier works. Their previous effort, Unleash the Beast, is a far better offering. I am a Saxon fan, but someone has to tell it like it is. The boys don't deliver on this recording."
4,PURE METAL AT IT'S BEST,"Well where do you begin. This band never got any respect for what it is they are great at and that is straight hard rock in your face. Rock isn't complex it's just rock. These guys never stopped creating the sound that others put to the side when they sold out to their record labels. Just because these guys don't sound like everyone else doesn't give people the right to call them cheap. ""MetalHead"" Rocks from front to back. I think ""Solid Ball of Rock"", ""Dogs of War"" and ""Unleash the Beast"" are their best works. This album falls off slightly but I am yet to find a band to come close to blowing these guys away. America embrace Saxon or get the hell out of the way."
2,More of the same and not so good by the way!,"I'm a huge Saxon fan, but I must say this album, sandwiched between ""Unleash the Beast"" (1997) and ""Killing Ground"" (2001) will add nothing to your collection. It's clearly the weakest Saxon album in recent years. It has ""formula"" written all over it, but without the magic feel of Saxon, that's responsibility of Biff great vocals and Paul Quinn's simple and creative guitar work."
1,It's not the Saxon I know,"Before this one Saxon released ""Unleash the beast"", their best album in years. Then came this one: ""Metalhead"" - a record that lack everything ""Unleash the beast"" had. The material is weak with the exception of two songs (""Conquistador"" and ""What goes around""), and it seems to me that Saxon were trying to update their music without any success at all. Maybe this album deserve 1 1/2 star but to be frank - two good songs aren't enough.""Metalhead"" is not a good starting point to explore this great band that have not only been a huge inspiration to heavy metal, but also managed to stay alive through thick and thin. Thankfully Saxon returned after this musical failure with the much better and more traditional sounding ""Killing ground"". If you want Saxon at their best you should get ""Strong arm of the law"", ""Denim and leather"" and ""Unleash the beast""."
4,Marc Shapiro's book on Mariah,"This is a good, well-written current book on Mariah. it has good pics, and its fun to read. It's worth the money!! Buy it!!"
3,Flimsy Stands,"I placed one of these on my dresser, and it fell over every time I open or closed a drawer. Photo frames of other brands do not move at all. One frame I had to mount because the stand was such poor quality. The 4x6 frames only have nail mounts on the back to accommodate vertical display.Other than that, the larger frames mount nicely, and the frames stand well on surfaces that will not be touched like bookshelves or other more stable fixtures. They look really nice! The silver is not scratched and looks great."
4,What I was looking for....................,"Just what I was looking for .............looks good my piano in the family room. But, I mixed it up with other silver frames . To break it up.I had to buy some mats ....so it did not look all the same. Would buy it again. Good value"
3,Very dull silver,"It's ok for the price you pay. The silver is very dull and not shiny like I hoped it would be, but I guess you get what you paid for."
2,You Get What You Pay For--Disappointed,"They look nice especially for the price but they break very easily. I used mine on table tops and shelves and the back frame ""holder"" or ""leg"" broke on three frames already. They are cheaply made and next time I'll spend the extra money for better frames. Disappointed!"
2,repete,I was underwhelmed with the quality of these. I've had them for over a year and I don't really use them because they are a little cheap looking.
2,broken,"I was a little hesitant of purchasing the frames after reading some of the reviews. I was looking for simple silver picture frames to display pictures of me and my fiance at our wedding. Of the 10 frames in the package, 4 were either broken or scratched. I sent the frames back. Thank goodness for amazon's easy return policy!"
2,You get what you pay for,This product is pretty cheap and so it the quality. At least they are a pretty basic design. We've only used a couple of the frames.
4,Exactly what I expected for the price,"Its not the highest quality frame, but that's not what I was looking for either. For the price, it is definitely worth it. 8x10 frames even have a mat to be able to us a 4x6 picture in the frame. I gave as Christmas gifts of pictures of our new baby and my family was happy with it. The clasps in the back to hold the picture in are much better than a lot of 'nicer' frames out there."
4,Great deal,These frames were a great deal for the price. If you were to buy equivalents at the store you would probably pay $5-15/each. At $2 (plus shipping) each I was pretty pleased.
1,returned!,"i thought ""20 bucks for 10 frames?! thats a great deal"" til i got my receipt saying it already shipped and i realized that they charged me $26 dollars for 2 day shipping. Nowhere on the checkout page did it say that this item was not eligible for Amazon Prime free 2 day shipping. i ordered this for a christmas present, and it really messed up my funds for the rest of my gifts. i ended up paying $46 dollars for these stupid frames, all by amazon not clarifying the shipping. i ended up returning these and not even getting the frames.Not to mention the frames look sorta cheap and flimsy."
2,Wall mount air compressor,"While it is nice to have the compressor mounted on the wall and up off the floor, this one does not have the performance I had hoped for. It is more nosey then I thought it would be, the tank is too small. It seems like the compressor is always running. I wish I had bought a larger compressor for the same money at Sears."
5,Pole Saw,This saw worked great! It had plenty of power and I liked being able to remove the pole to cut up all the branches I cut off.
4,Great Little Saw,"This Remington Electric Pole Saw is very handy, easy to use and reasonably priced. I used it the first day to trim several large Oak and Maple tree limbs. It made short work of the task and performed flawlessly. My only criticism is that I wish the reach of the pole was longer. I can see where some people might have difficulty handling the saw with a longer pole being fully extended, but in those cases there could always be the option to not extend the pole to the full length. Otherwise, great little saw."
4,Product evaluation,"Good assembly thus far. The major benefit is the 10"" blade which has no problem cutting in either direction. While the 8amp motor gives it extra kick, beware of the extension cord length. If it's too long & skinny, the breaker will pop. Also when not in use, the auto oiler continues to leak, so wrap a rag around the chain."
5,Remington 10-inch 8 amp electric pole saw,My husband really likes the saw. He has used it several times with great results. It's exactly as advertised and easy to handle.
4,"impressive, but watch bar oil","This thing is impressive, but make sure you watch the bar oil closely.. I've been applying bar oil manually because the bubble pump isn't any good. Especially if it is cold outside.. carry a little $2 oil can with you and add a little oil every couple of branches and you're ok...i read about other people modifying the applicator, but i haven't had time to look at doing that yet.."
3,Remington Electric Pole Saw 10 inch,"Gets the job done. Problems, comes with plastic wing nut to attach saw to pole, change to metal wing nut. Trouble with extension pole - had to glue orange pole to black plastic stop latch (used to latch down extension pole length) to keep chain saw from rotating. It appears that the pole was glued at the factory but not glued well enough. September 2011"
5,Remington Pole Saw,Great product. Works well on small trees and low hanging braches so you won't need a ladder. Easy to use
2,Good saw for price But,This is the second of these saws I have purchased. The only problems is that after the second purchase I discovered it VERY HARD and mostly impossible to find repair parts. Remington seems to have stop manufacturing these model. I am still looking for electric motor parts to repair one of the saws.
3,Works Great but has one MAJOR flaw...,"The main gear is a hard plastic. If you push this saw hard it WILL strip out. This may be ok if you can find a replacement gear, but I haven't been able to yet. If you have acres of limbs to cut that may be too much for this saw. If you just trim occasionally it is a great tool.UPDATE: I found the replacement for only $10 online. Just Google it. I have to up the stars to 4 now."
4,best dual purpose saw,"i use this saw for cutting limbs from my pecan trees and then detach the saw and cut the limbs up. the saw detaches easy enough with no tools, and the saw is small enough to be light on the end of the pole yet useful enough for cutting limbs when detached. your not going to use this to cut a big tree down (unless you want it to be a one time use saw), but it works fine for what I use it for. It extends longer than most of the other pole saws, and detaches easier."
3,A Nice product,This saw while it has a couple flaws really does a nice job. The Extension system is a bit of a challenge to work with and almost requires two people. Another potential flaw is the safety lock that prevents you from simply depressing the trigger. Once you get past these two things It cuts real well. I've never utilized a chain saw but this morning I used one to cut an overhead limb that was damaged and it cut through it pretty well.After it was down I used it to cut the limb up into manageable segments.
2,Has Problems,Product does not live up to it's reviews. Trimmings always get caught in guard requiring constant stopping to clear. Product is also hard to hold for long periods of time to to it's weight.
4,Big tool for small yards,"This saw makes an easy job of trimming branches that are too large to lop. Off the pole, it is useful as an electric chain saw.This is not a Tim Allen tool. You won't grow hair on your chest by using it. It is a convenient tool for suburban once in a while use."
3,It's an OK trimmer for an electric pole saw,"It's an Ok trimmer for ocassional use but does have some design flaws. The trigger is located at the very end of the handle which makes it unnecessarilary heavy at the saw end whether it's extended or not. It would help the center of balance and make it more user friendly if the trigger were moved up a bit and the trigger release button made easier to operate, it's annoying trying to push the release and depress the trigger at the same time. It does an ok job of cutting once you can manage to get into position. Not something I would buy again."
4,Pole saw,Easy to put together and easy to use. I have used it to trim tall branchs that would require a ladder I can now stand on the ground.
4,effective and easy to use,"The saw is pretty straightforward. I took it out of the box and spend 10 minutes going through the instructions and started cutting. Wait, I had to go buy a bottle of SAE-30 motor oil--it should have been shipped with the saw, at least a small bottle. The cuttting is pretty effective. It took 30 seconds or so to take down a 5"" trunck. I spent about 30 minutes and created a huge pile of branches and truncks. The weight is an issue when you have the pole fully extended. But even though I'm not a muscline guy, I don't find it hard to manage as it is pretty balanced. You just have to take more frequent break. the only real downside is the plug as it constantly disconnected with the power cable. There should be a small design on the pole that allows you to fix the power cable to it, so it doesn't get pulled apart from the saw's power cord so often. Overall, a simple and effective tool."
4,Extended reach,Remington 10-Inch 1.5 HP Electric Pole-Mounted Chainsaw #PS1510AGreat little chain saw to use on or off the pole. I found the saw a little difficult to manipulate when you use the saw's adjustable part of the extension pole.
5,Remington PS1510A,"Love this baby. As others have written, it pays for itself after one use considering what some of the 'tree guys' want in $$$. Less than two hours of time with my 'other half' picking up the branches, (good exercise for both), 45 minutes to and from the recycling center, (fifteen bucks plus the gas in our F-150), and we still have the trimmer for next time. My ONLY complaints are that it should have come with a small starter container of oil, (was ready to rock, but had to run to the hardware store for the 30W), and it's too bad Remington doesn't incorporate a little shut off valve to keep that oil from seeping after you're finished with the unit as opposed to draining everytime. Otherwise, thumbs up !!!"
4,trimmingthebrush,Using the saw was all I expected. it cut thru some large stuff as well as some twigs and handled better than my hedge trimers. I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner. It's proven to be a huge time saver and cut my weekly yard work almost in half. The extension now allows me to reach into places I only hoped to reach in the past and made it much safer triming in the higher elevations. A. CAPORALE
5,Good value for the money,"This was my first purchase of a non-gas piece of outdoor equipment and I was concerned about performance. I have been pleasantly surprised by this saw. My lot is roughly 100' x 100' with 8 full-grown trees, so I have already put it to the test multiple times. It's very handy for basic maintenance and I can hit every tree with my 100' extension cord. The 10' blade is large enough to handle all my pruning needs."
5,Testosterone on a stick,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore. This one is more powerful than I anticipated, and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole. Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence). Cleans up yard trash in a snap. I did not experience the oil leakage described by others. The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn, so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
3,Okay saw - not so good handle,"I bought one of these saws and had to take it back the first weekend because the handle lock would not keep saw extended. Also noticed oil did not lube chain correctly. Bought second one, drilled oiler hole out a bit as another poster mentioned, this fixed oiler issue but handle is doing same thing. I tried to tighten screw and it still slips down, this one is going back too. The little saw works great though, they just need to improve handle lock and I would keep it in my shed...."
3,"Good product, small manufacturing mistake","I like it alot, it is a great idea for trimming. This is easy to use, I've used it standing on a ladder and my roof.Remington put too many links in the chain, making it at the end of its adjustment. I used it for a couple days, then I had another chain made with one less link. Two or three less may have been ok also.The Lawnmower shop didnt want to shorten my chain. It was an Oregon chain, and they only had Stihl chains and parts."
2,Buy Cheap and get what you pay for!,"First of all I bought this because I liked its design and was perfect for what I needed it for.First time I used it? Great! Fantastic! Swiveling cutter reached all those hard to reach places!Second time I used it? Awesome! This is a blessing and for the price? Awesome!!!!!Third time I used it? My neighbors came over to ask about it since they saw how well it reached and preformed on my hedges,as I was bragging to them about it and the prices they all were conviced that they were going to get one for themselves....that is until as I was showing them how easy it was to use and how you can adjust the blade to different angles the friggin motordied!Guess what Remington? You lost 4 potential customers plus me!Design is great,motor is not!Don't buy it,shop around more times then not you pay alittle more but you get quality for the few more dollars spent!"
3,Remington Electric Pole Saw,This product was defective from the manufacture. The saw could not be attached to the pole. I did contact CPO Outlet and they had FED EX pick up the package and issued a refund. I did not reorder.
5,It 's Nice,"I have been on ladders cutting tree limbs. Now, I can be safer on the ground and cut tree limbs. Plus, I can usethis saw without the pole. It is great to use."
5,Deceptive little saw--It works!,"I bought this saw thinking, ""Oh well, it'll be a Chinese piece of junk but I really need a pole saw."" When I opened the package it looked as expected--Like a cheap plastic toy chain saw. HOWEVER, after using it on three or four major yard projects, I'm impressed. I've taken out lots of old juniper with no problems. It slices through 5-inch thick branches with ease. It took down a 30-foot maple in no time (The thickest part of the trunk I cut with a gas saw). I re-sharpened it and went for two juniper trees. Nothing to it. I'm very happy with this saw and already feel I got my money's worth. I'll write again when it breaks apart--IF it breaks apart."
4,Excelent,"After receiving the Pole Saw, I used it the next day and was astounded about the quality of this little saw. The part I'm missing is a plastic Chain protector for storage or transport.A grade purchase I can recommend it to friends!"
4,A little hard to handle for an 80 year old.,I got this for a friend who is 80. He had told me he was looking at them at a local hardware store. I told him I would check online for reviews and prices. We agreed this was the one for him. And it was 80 bucks cheaper than the store.He really likes it but has to go slow. He wanted the electric one because he didn't want to use a pull cord starter.
4,Remington RM1015P 10-Inch 8 Amp Electric Pole Saw,"So far so good I have used this saw around my house a few times it works very nicely cuts the trees like its butter. Nice price, would buy again."
5,Oustanding!,"Absolutely one of the best things I ever bought. Good quality and works great. Very lightweight compared to a gas saw. Got on the roof and trimmed back tons of branches that I never thought I would be able to get. Gutters stay much cleaner now. Knowing what I know now, I would have gladly paid twice as much for it. It's certainly worth every penny. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Parts not available.,Nice product works great but problem is you cannot get parts for it.I need a Chain Adjusting Plate Assy. All they tell me is the parts are not available.
4,Search carefully BEFORE purchasing,"I have learned that one should shop carefully and compare prices before making a purchase at Amazon.com. The Remington pole saw that I purchased on Amazon.com on September 7, 2011 for $99.99 was advertised in the ACE Hardware September-October 2011 mailed advertisement for in retail store purchase for $79.99. The Amazon price is 25% higher than the Ace price. I started to send an image of the ACE advertisement, but noted in the ""What I Shouldn't Send"" section, images of price should not be sent. So the lesson is: shop elsewhere carefully for price BEFORE making any purchase at Amazon.com. If Amazon wants an image of the advertisement, I can easily immediately send such. Arturo"
3,Great saw but???,"I purchased one of these 10"" pole saws this summer and used it about three times before the chain started jumping off the drive gear. I found that a ""c"" clip for the plate that holds the chain on the drive gear had popped off. I replaced the clip, but it only stayed on for one more run. I purchased Remington's 14"" trimmer version and mounted it to the pole and haven't had any problems since. Some of these saws have the ""c"" clip and some have bolts holding the plate in place. Beware of the ""c"" clip."
4,Polesaw worth every penny,"I had a tree pruning job to do,where the branches were close to power lines. My terrain is uneven and I suffer from a fear of heights. One day I was in home depot looking for a manual polesaw. Right next to the manual polesaws, I saw the Remington polesaw/chainsaw. I bought it with skepticism figuring I could return it if it didn't cut the mustard. This gutsy little saw made the job much easier,and helped me get the job done in a couple hours. It is solidly made and while the saw won't bringdown a redwood,it is very powerful considering it is at the end of an 8 ft pole (try that with a 20 inch saw!)It is well worth it"
4,Good deal for the $$$,"I've had this for close to 4 years. While some of the concerns listed by others are legit- the fact that the oiler button is poorly designed, has cracked & the rubber bulb has fallen into the oil well a couple of times, & it is heavy & hard to manuever when fully extended. That said, this has done so many jobs for me around the yard I'd be lost without it. The main thing is don't extend it farther than you have to & this way it's under control. As far as the oil problem, don't fill the resorvoir to the top."
5,Great Little Saw,"After my first cut I was satisfied. I picked the big one to start and when it hit the ground moments later it measured 6.5"". When I was done sawing I really had a mess with all the dead oak limbs. The saw did as prescribed and did it with ease. I extended the pole several different times when cutting varying heights and uses 150' of extension cord. I would buy this again or for gift. It's extremely useful."
4,"My Remington 10"" Pole Mounted Chain Saw",I am very happy with this product.I can now trim from the ground instead of climbing ladders.
2,Just Too Cheaply Made,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago after reading great reviews people posted about it. I am not sure what they were using it for, but it has become one of those ""I knew it was too good to be true"" buys for me. In designing any type of power tool, there is a level of quality that has to be maintained for the tool to perform. They went so far below that level with this pole saw that you will spend more time taking it apart and fixing it than you will cutting with it. Basically it is a piece of junk. A little too much pressure on the blade and the chain jumps off the clutch/sprocket. The clutch drum is plastic. How can you expect a plastic friction drum to hold up. Put the money you would have spent on this thing into a decently made unit, and be happy."
5,A must have.,"Denis Azabagic performs brilliantly in this DVD. A true master of the classical guitar, his performance of Agustin Barrios Mangore's La Catedral is truly amazing. A must have DVD for the classical guitar student or enthusiast."
5,Love these dishes!,"These dishes are high quality and a great color. I wanted something fun and different. The mugs are perfect if you like coffe, tea or cocoa! I ordered one set and and in the process of ordering a 2 set of dishes, matching glasses and the sugar and creamer set."
3,I like the set but lots of drawbacks,"I've had these plates for about 2 years. They are very pretty and overall I like them, but they have lots of drawbacks. First, they are very big -- the bowls especially are huge, and it's hard to track portions. Secondly, the plates get easily marked by silverware, so all of them now have thin black lines all over. Third, the salad plates are less durable (I've had 4 of 10 break in 2 years; none of the other pieces have broken). But most importantly, the plates come out of the microwave BURNING HOT! This is a major problem. I'll probably replace the whole set in another year or two."
3,They're just OK,"I've had this set about 4 years. The big plates, bowls and cups have held up pretty well. The smaller white-and-blue plates, which have a slightly thinner texture, all broke within the first year.My biggest complaint is that the bowls are HUGE, very large capacity. You can dump an entire can of soup into the bowl and without getting near the brim. A cup of cereal looks like a tiny serving in these bowls. Which is fine for some people, and I do think they look nice. But I had a harder time with portion control using the bowls.The white parts of these dishes do develop faint gray stains - this puzzled us at first, but the Pfaltzgraff web site says this is perfectly normal for white stoneware. It's a reaction to stainless steel silverware. This really doesn't bother us, we just didn't expect it. Someone who loves pristine dishes should probably avoid white stoneware."
3,doesn't wear well,"We've had these dishes for about a year and a half, and I've be unhappy with them for some time. the plates are covered in lines from cutting food with silverware on them. We've had about 2 mug handles break, but there seems to be a pattern to the bowl rims chipping. i just don't like how they hold up, i don't think I'd buy pfaltzgraff again."
1,Tepid Stuff,"Despite the authors own glowing review, I found that this book lacked the enthusiasm , and the zest for life that marked the disco era. How could one write a book about Disco that lacks the passion that pumped through the music and got us all on the dance floor .SATURDAY NIGHT FOREVER was a much better read this this lack luster number."
1,What Extremely Bad Taste,"for the author to write his own (surprise!) five star review below. For that reason alone, this book merits a one star rating. This is only reinforced by an actual perusal of its pages."
1,what the...,"I did not know that authors were allowed to review their work? I agree that Mr Andriote showed extreme poor taste in posting such a glowing review of his work ... especially when you consider that the book, was a rehashing of everything we have heard before.. nothing new, nothing informative ... and certainly nothing entertaining.. Sorry Mr Andriote you were way off base on this one"
3,vacation video,"...basically looks like home video, but it's in field-sequential 3D. Personally, I would have preferred a tropical/carribean excursion, but the 3D here is good (you must have the special viewing equipment) and you could do worse as far as DVDs for this system go (i.e. Hunting Season or Camp Blood). You could also do better: Spy Kids 3D (HQFS version!), Santa vs. the Snowman (HQFS edition!) or Transitions 3D."
4,Newline Digital Scale,Short and sweet. The wall hanger does not secure the scale very well.The read out could be a bit brighter. Other than that I like them. Better than the last 2 I had.
2,quit working,"Bought this scale about a year ago and it just quit working. I replaced the batteries, but the display is now so faint it cannot be read. I only used it maybe 20 times.The manufacture placed information tags - not removable - on the bottom so if the scale is hung up, instead of a nice, modern silver-finish, you see the tags and it is not attractive.The scale shuts off very quickly, so when you are packing and weighing multiple items, the scale has to be turned on every time - and it takes a few seconds to warm up.The material is light weight plastic. Would not recommend this scale."
4,Works great,"The only thing I don't like is having to remember how to change the time on it. But if that's the worst thing about this because I can't remember where I left the instructions then it's seriously minor. This is a wonderful scale and folds in half to save space when you aren't using it, granted I use mine every day, multiple times a day."
3,does whats needed,I needed a scale to help me measure foods for my new diet and it does come in handy for cooking too.This scale does it's job and is acurate it just goes thru batteries like crazy. I wish it had a power cordso I wouldn't be using so many batteries. But other then that it's a nice little scale.
1,Missed the Mark,Bought this scale in April and found it a bit hard to read and set up but figured once it was in use it would be ok. Today I tried to use it and found that it had lost its mind. It would show 0 when nothing was on it and as soon as I added the smallest weight it registered 13.7oz Tried resetting it by removing the batteries and that didn't help. It is much too late to return it but be warned that it is a very poor value.
1,"Is ""newline"" a code word for ""chintzy'?","My definition of ""chintzy"":Poor instructionsCheaply madeLoss of dollars"
2,Doesn't count calories...:(,"I purchased this item but returned it without using it. I was looking for a scale that would count the calories and other nutritional facts of my food. Unfortunately, this scale is strictly a scale in the sense of weighing the food. I'm sure it is a very good scale, but I really cannot comment on it's functionality. I can only clear up what the description does not: and that is, if you are looking for a scale to give you nutritional facts, this is not the scale for you. I will say it is small and compact and would not be obtrusive on any kitchen counter."
3,Not the most rugged scale ever made,"When it works, it's pretty good. However, given the very poor wall-mounting bracket and the barely-there way it holds the scale, mine fell 6 inches to the counter as I was putting it away. Now it only works if I remove the batteries and power it on, then weigh everything before the auto-off feature kicks in. Otherwise I get an error message.In theory it's useful if you have limited counter space, but all things considered - the terribly insecure wall hinge, the fragility of it - you'd be better off spending your cash on a simple, more sturdy countertop model.Lastly, the thermostat is not accurate. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but it's fairly useless."
3,Film Has Style But Little Substance,"What was the point of the film? That adultery is forgivable and one can actually end up in heaven? The film lacks the wit of earlier Lubitsch films such as ""Shop Around the Corner"". It's way too talky and lacks action. For example, viewers would've sympathized with Martha the scorned wife more had the film shown her witnessing her husband's infidelity. Don Ameche is competent as the lead but lacks the spark and roguish charm the role requires. I found it hard to believe women would find him irresistable and that his wife would want to stay married to him. This film could've eliminated several scenes not quite pertinent to its story, which dilutes the impact of the storyline. Don't buy this film. Rent it first."
3,what happened anyways?,"Hmmm. This movie could have been very cute, and has several fine and comical parts. Unfortunately, too many things don't follow or are clumsily explained, not too mention it should be a good 15 minutes shorter. For me, it would have been a much better story if all of Ameche's so called ""sins"" were only misunderstandings/misperceptionsfrom his squareish family (as many seem to be). I was fully expecting them to explained as such by the devil himself at the end, and that he would fully realize his fine character as the devil boots him to heaven.But if i'm supposed to understand that he really sinned, why is he going to heaven, and what sense does that make alongside his doting relation to his wife? I think this movie is either generally misunderstood or not fully realized, or worse both."
4,More significant extras needed,"Criterion is good,isn't? Well, some things need to be added to this edition to be a collector's item. First, a good commentaries track by a good film critic or historian of cinema wouldn't be out of place. The best example I remember is historian Ken Barnes in ""Citizen Kane"" (complete analysis of the film). Also, I know that somebody that is buying this knows Lubitsch, but a Bio page doesn't take space and is informative for the rest. A little feature showing the differences in color and props through the different stages of the film would be also very educative (a lost opportunity). I think Criterion must prepare with more care their discs, thinking of them as the definitive editions for future reference of each film involved (even if this means two discs instead of one!!)."
5,Any Lubitsch is a Great Movie,"""Heaven Can Wait"" isn't my favorite Lubitsch, it's too much made in USA. I prefer his b/w movies, also made in USA, especially ""Trouble in Paradise"", ""The Shop Around The Corner"" and ""To Be Or Not To Be"", and of course ""Ninotchka"". But any Lubitsch is well worth collecting, especially if restored by Criterion. His unique touch is present here too, and the transfer is impeccable. How about a decent transfer of ""To Be Or Not To Be""?"
3,Heaven Can Wait,"Probably would not be popular with the under 50 crowd, Don Ameche (the hero) is supposed to be a womanizer - but it's only alluded to in a very chaste manner - he's a bad boy but the audience isn't supposed to know that. The costumes were excellent - the hair styles were wierd. Acting was good and story line was interesting."
3,FORTIES LUBITSCH,"I finally viewed this film after meaning to for years and I was a little disappointed. I felt that it contained passable but uninspired performances from the leads, and the Technicolor itself seemed gaudy. The supporting cast seemed more effective with Laird Cregar as Lucifer himself (he was great) plus the hilarious Marjorie Main and gruff Eugene Pallette as Gene's parents. I think that it was my subconscious comparing this work with the Lubitsch gems of the thirties. By 1943, his touch seemed a little outdated, therefore this little flick was just a tad disappointing (to me anyway)."
3,Not as good as remembered.,My husband had seen this movie many years ago & raved about it. We both thought it was OK and he was even surprised it wasn't as good as remembered.
2,RIP GH6177XPB-5,"Born 7/08 purchased 1/09. Died 6/09. Could not be repaired, 2x. Now discontinued. Whirlpool has offered me Gmh6185XVB but no g2 speed cook. Thanks, Whirlpool"
5,Excellent Replacement Part,"Product arrived quickly,well packaged. The regulator installed quickly and easily. Smooth operation. Appeared to be better quality than factory part it replaced. Very satisfied."
3,Window Regulator,"The Seller did a good job, just rating the product.This is the third regulater I have purchased for my truck,on the same driver side door, why? Because the OEM part is twice or three times the price of these China copied parts. They are good for two years maybe three at the most. Who knows maybe the OEM part is made in China too or at least Mexico. One thing about it, I'm getting faster at changing them out, just wish Chevrolet would have put hinges on the inner door panel too!Definately would speed up the install. The stamped out parts for this were not up to standard but I made it work."
2,Disappointing review of data storage concepts,"Information lifecycle management is an emerging concept, better helping companies ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data appropriately. I was excited that a new book had been published on the subject only to find it was mostly a rehash of storage concepts .. I found nothing new or of interest. Good title, but the content doesn't match what I was expecting."
3,"Funny, but not what I expected.","I thought is was going to be more of a comedy, but it's still good. It's a long movie. It definitely dragged on in certain parts."
3,"Hilarious, but long","This movie had me rolling on the floor at times, but the story start dragging toward the last 30 minutes or so. I wasn't expecting it to challenge me intellectually, but the movie was just too easy to figure out."
2,Weak Middle,The story just dragged out forever... about 3 years too many. It seems like they ran out of ideas and just started making up filler for the middle 30-45 minutes.
1,HORRID,What a waste of $4! We only watched for 30 minutes before turning it off. They drop the F bomb every 5 minutes it seems for no reason whatsoever. Don't waste you're time or money!
3,Pretty funny,"A great compromise for me and my wife. Jason Segel is always funny, but the rest of the movie isn't bad either."
2,5 long years,Movie seemed 5 years long. Had high hopes for this movie as Jason Segal is typically funny.. Very few funny moments in this movie.
3,Too long,"The movie has its funny moments but overall is just ok. 2 hrs was way too long, it seemed that midpoint throughout the movie they were trying to extend it for no major reason at all. I'd say wait till it's $0.99 to rent it, not worth the $4.99 to watch it in HD."
3,choppy,Cute movie but the story was a bit choppy. And at times it felt like they were just throwing in random occurrences without them helping the story along.
3,It's Okay,"Slow and kind of boring. I thought I was renting a comedy like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it just wasn't what I thought it would be."
3,Just Okay,"This movie was funny at times and cute, but disappointing considering how much I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall. It was too long and not funny enough."
3,Above average,"Worth a rental, but not one you'll be talking about forever. Nothing memorable, but will help kill a few hours."
2,Feels Like A Five-Year Movie,"I am so disappointed, I certainly expected more with the credentials attached to this movie. To start with, even though I like Emily Blunt, I found her natural British accent disconcerting within the confines of this particular movie. It just did not fit. This movie is very predictable and juvenile. The best thing about it was the soundtrack. The movie went from bad to worse, what a stinker! Avoid it!!"
3,Funny but a bit outlandish,If I could I would give 3.5 stars. got a little long and predictable. it annoys me when people make obvious stupid decisions
2,Meh,Five year engagement? Seemed more like the five year movie. I like Blunt and Segal but it wasn't their best. My expectations weren't super high to begin with.
3,An Okay Movie,It was your typical dramatic comedy. It was kind of long. Had some very funny lines. For the price it's not a bad buy.
3,Good movie.,"Good storyline. A little slow on the development, but overall not a disappointment. Not the best Jason Segel movie I've seen, but still worth watching."
5,Loved it,This movie was two snaps up and a circle. I just love romantic comedies and this one is suited my taste well. there were some slow parts but overall it rocked!!!
5,"Funny, Witty & Charming","This was funny, charming, and witty, with a touch of drama.Segel and Blunt had terrific chemistry and what a perfectly cast group of talented comedians.This really did the romantic comedy genre justice.This is one of those movies I'll will be watching more than once."
4,A Cute Romantic Comedy!!,"Here's The Lowedown on ""The Five Year Engagement"" (A Romantic Comedy DVD review)...Liked IT!Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook!!!Genre: 7 Movie: 6What's it about?Exactly one year after Tom Solomon meets Violet Barnes, he surprises her with a ring. By all accounts, Tom and Violet are destined for their happily ever after. However, this engaged couple just keep getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.What did I think?I loved the beginning and the end, but in the middle was a lot of fluff and filler to make the audience feel as if this engagement...and movie...have gone on far too long. As I was watching the film, I couldn't help but remember the romantic comedy that kept playing in ""Friends with Benefits""; which has Jason Segel in it. I kept saying ""Flapjack"" all the way through. It is worth renting if you can suffer through to the end...that was great!"
4,Heartfelt and very funny,"The characters are likable and real and their conflicts are authentic to real life. Blunt, Segal, and the supporting cast (including Chris Pratt--Andy--from Parks and Rec and Alison Brie of Mad Men and Community) are really, really funny. I felt as if were joking with me, not at a camera or an audience. The movie is a mix of thoughtful commentary on relationships and people being silly, evoking a mood similar to that of movies like Juno and Bridesmaids. While not quite as *hilarious* as Bridesmaids, it still has the same vibe in that we're able to watch a relationship play out on screen not unlike those we've seen around us (or been a part of) while intermittently laughing aloud to relieve the tension. I highly recommend it :)"
4,Funny from start to finish,"""The Five-Year Engagement"" is a romantic comedy film which is loaded with humorous scenes and dialogue.Jason Segel (Tom Solomon) and Emily Blunt (Violet Barnes) combine to be a fun onscreen couple, and Chris Pratt (Alex Eilhauer) complements them both as the gaudy best friend of Tom Solomon.It's rare to have a movie that is so stacked with humour and a narrative that continues to interest, plus it is over two hours in duration which isn't the norm for its genre, yet it all blends together nicely and keeps the viewer laughing.Nicholas R.W.

4,Great Movie!,"I'm surprised at how enjoyable this movie was to watch. It kept me entertained the whole way through. The actors had great chemistry and their dialogue was witty and funny. I had several laugh outloud moments. I liked how the physical comedy wasn't over the top. This movie touched on real life relationship issues in a light hearted way. If you're in the mood for a good romantic comedy (and foul language doesn't bother you, it is rated R) then watch it, it's worth it."
2,Producers of Bridesmaids...Really?!?!?,"I was excited about this film after seeing the previews. After watching it for 40 minutes, I had to turn it off, because there was no reason for to continue to finish this movie. All of funny parts must have been in the previews! I only maybe saw one of these funny parts in the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie. See it if your curious. Otherwise if you are looking for a hilarious comedy like Bridesmaids look elsewhere, because this pales in comparison to Bridesmaids!"
1,I want a refund,Started this movie and quit it after 5 min. I'm so disappointed in the quality of this movie. Refund please.
1,movie,This movie arrived as new and on time..That's all we can say about it...STUPID!!!! And most boring..but that's the chance you take when you listen to the hollywood critics...will try not to make that mistake again.
1,Don't waste your time!,It's not even worth $1.99. I wouldn't suggest it even if it's free. This movie is sooooooo boring! No point to the movie at all. Kinda cool to see Ann Arbor in the movie though.
1,Boring,"Slow, boring. Waste of $1.99. Glad I did no opt for Hd for one dollar more. Pick another movie to watch."
4,Standard chick flick,"If you like chick flicks, watch it!If you don't, don't!Pretty simple :-) really. You kind of know how these will go but its good entertainment if you like movies"
3,a bit predicatable,"was really drawn out and slow at points. some of the jokes were not funny at all, but over all kinda fun."
2,Not very funny,Watched it with my wife because she thought it looked cute. Not very entertaining. This movie was not funny or very romantic.
1,Poor Excuse for a Movie at Any Price,"I was fortunate to nod off a couple of times, while my wife had the unfortunate experience of watching the entire movie. About as bad as a movie gets and not worth the time to elaborate on it. Even the attempts at stereo-type humor that might have made me laugh were stale and unimaginative. Renting this movie was my mistake, don't make it yours."
1,Hated it!!!!!!,"I thought this movie was boring, stupid, and quite frankly a waste of time. My daughter and I couldn't even make it through it. I was very disappointed, I expected a lot more."
1,Not even remotely funny,"I actually like most romantic comedies which is why I rented this, but ""The Five Year Engagement"" isn't even remotely funny. The estrogen levels are so high it makes ""Eat, Pray, Love"" seem like ""Fast and Furious Five"". Guys, you've been warned. This movie is strictly girls night out!"
2,"Self-Plagiarism, alive & well","""The Five Year Engagemnt"" is basically a re-hashing of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" BUT LESS FUNNY. Jason Segel repeats his roll as the nice, sweet male character victimized by life & a powerful independent woman. He slides down from a successful career minded position in life to the basement level of loser-ness only to pick himself back up at the end; when he again realizes he's the person responsible for his life, which of course was & is a good one, in-fact better than most. ( And on a side note, what's with Jason Segel's need to write himself naked in all of his movies. He's not really eye candy for the women & us men sure as H_ _ _ don't need to see it. )"
2,Not Good,"I like the actors, but this movie was terrible. I felt like I sat through 5 years of tortured mess."
3,not worth the hype,for all the hype this was given i definitely feel sorry for the people that bought it ~ guess this is what everyone wants to watch these days? amazing that this movie was over two hours long ~ even more amazing is that i watched it!
2,bored,Couldn't get through this one. Just get married already. I expected much more from this film. Don't waste your time.
3,"Slow and angonizing, then a strong finish","I love these actors and always enjoying watching them, especially Emily Blunt. However, this movie was agonizing to watch in the beginning. We almost didn't stick with it through the middle, but it did finish strong. It was a good movie overall with a comedic heartfelt story line."
3,The world less known,I thought this movie was going to be what it was. Ok. It wasn't horrible it wasn't great. I'll probably watch it again in a month to see if I'll enjoy it more.
3,Depressing - Thought it would be funnier.,"The movie was a little Depressing. I thought it would be funnier since it was listed as a comedy.If you are looking for a ""feel good"" movie. This is not it."
3,Alright,It was alright. I give it 2 and 3/4 stars if I could because it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.
3,It was okay...,"I was looking forward to watching this movie, but I read some negative reviews. I decided to watch it anyway. Well, it was a little bit depressing! I was looking forward to a humorous, light movie. If this is what you are looking for, do not watch this movie. Don't get me wrong, there are a few funny parts in the movie, but overall it had more of a gloomy tone to it throughout the majority of the movie. It was also way too long."
3,Expected better,Thought it would be much funnier than it was. I hate that these reviews require a minimum number of words....
2,preview funnier than movie,"I had very high hopes for this film after seeing the.commercials. It seemed hilarious so I rented it to help get me out of a slump. The movie is two hrs of awkward! All the funniest parts of the film were put into the commercials and not much more was in the film. The movie was more sad than funny. It's not a comedy about things getting in the way of their engagement, but rather an engagement unraveling in the saddest of ways with a twist ending. Ended up making me feel worse than better."
2,Too long,Like the engagement this movie was stretched out more than it should have been. It was funny but felt like it was dragged out.
2,"Funny, warm and charming premise - why all the crudity?","Endearing and relevant premise. So much to relate to. So funny and charming. Such warmth and quiet tension. The humor potential was met and so nicely. But all these makings of a memorable and enjoyable story were interrupted with rude and crudely unnecessary images. Made something sweet and funny, intermittently turn ugly. I felt flashed over and over. These actors are so much more talented than that!"
3,Not as good as I would have hoped,"This movie seemed like it lasted forever, it has a really good cast, so I think I was expecting a lot more from it in terms of the movie itself, but there just wasn't enough meat to the movie to make it either super funny or compelling."
3,Ok...but not what I'd expect from Jason Segal,"This movie was fine, but it got way too slow in the middle and you started wondering when it was going to be over. It's not as funny as most movies with Jason Segel. I was really excited about this movie because I love Jason Segel and I'm engaged right now, but this movie didn't even impress it's target audience: someone like me. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Won't watch a second time."
2,Completely forgettable,"So much so, I forgot I had watched it. The only Jason Segel movie I have watched and liked is 50/50. This is not 50/50."
3,Just okay movie,"From the clips I was anxious to see this movie, however I was a bit disappointed. I found that the most humorous parts in the movie were the clips they showed."
3,Decent movie but a bit too long,Thought it was cool to watch a movie that was filmed at least partly in Ann Arbor which is just a little ways from me. The movie overall was pretty entertaining but it hit a snag about 2/3 of the way in and just dragged on until the end picked up.
2,Really bad,I watched the trailer for this movie and it looked sooo funny so I was really excited to watch it. The few scenes that they showed in the trailer were the only funny parts of the movie!! The rest of the movie was really dumb and just way toooo long. Would not recommend it at all! It just took way to long to get to the point and was not funny or interesting. At some points it simply got wierd...I did not enjoy it at all.
1,The movie seemed five years long.,You usually expect romance and humor for this type of movie. It had none! I like Jason Segal but he was as disappointing as the rest of the movie. I believe the five years in the title is the time you felt you wasted watching this piece of junk.
1,not a good movie,Not as good as the previews depicts. Not worth buying for sure! We were hoping for a funny movie but the funny parts were all in the previews.
3,Not boring but not great,The movie had a couple of laughs but dragged near the end due to interminable machinations. The last half of the movie took too long.
2,"Good actors, so-so movie. Try ""Devil Wears Prada"" or ""I Love You Man"" instead.","I rented this to watch on a rainy day because I love Emily Blunt in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and love Jason Segal in "" How I Met Your Mother."" It started with a cute idea and funny dialogue and soon became long and painful to watch...the movie lost all its fun halfway through and I lost all interest in watching. Good cast, but the script is too poorly written to showcase the talents of its main actors."
3,3 out of 5,"The story line was good and there were several key funny parts. However, the movie was way too drawn out."
2,Not my favorite,Love jason segel but this movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. Slightly disappointing and the previews for the movie give away the real funny scenes.
2,The Too Long Movie,"I'm not an unhappy person; I love to laugh. I get a big kick out of comedy, when I rent a comedy I expect to have a laugh; or a chuckle, or something maybe a smile? This movie was so incredibly unfunny I just had to get it off my chest and write a review. Whether anyone is helped by this review or even reads it doesn't really matter. The main thing is I got to spew about it. The story is boy meets girl, falls in love, asks girl to marry him, she agrees but has to move to Michigan from San Francisco for school. They move, they stifle each other, fight, break up. He moves back to San Fran opens a taco truck is a huge success has a dumb girlfriend who is too young for him and she moves in with her professor. It's all very boring. It's all way too long. It's not very funny. I like both the leads in this movie so I thought I'd give it a try. Let's hope they have moved on to better things."
1,Seriously?,"I hate to say that this is a crappy movie since it is taste thing but I was surprised how poorly it was made...crappy screen play, horrible acting...bad direction...list goes on. It looked like an very bad indie movie with good funding."
2,Needs to be 30 minutes shorter,"The name of the film is appropriate because I felt all of the 5 long years watching it - it was way too long. Some good elements, but too much unneeded (and unwanted) footage was included in the final cut. I actually skipped ahead about 20 minutes during the middle of the film and didn't feel like I missed anything."
2,Not my favorite,"I like Emily Blunt and Jason Segal, so I expected a bit more from this movie. I felt like we were watching their relationship in real time. It dragged on and on. Kind of a bummer of a movie."
3,Jason Segel is depressingly funny,Usually don't enjoy these movies. Jason and his buddy make the movie for me with crude one liners that will make your wife blush. I would say this is a chick flick but at least there is some good humor to get the guys through. They should put his in the crudmedic love film category.
3,Not Sure,It just seemed like it would never end but it was ok for just easy viewing. I would recommend it.
3,A big jumble of Apatow & Segel's previous movies,Many of the same plot elements from their previous movies show up in this movie - so if you like them as a team then you'll probably like this one. It drags quite a bit in the center and I think it could have been improved significantly if it were shortened by about 30 minutes. There are few laugh out loud moments and the supporting characters are really great.
3,So so,"This movie started entertaining but then it just fell flat. I do not like the type of movies that the girl needs time away from her boyfriend, fiance, and sleep with another guy to finally realize that she made a mistake. This movie is predictable and I should have waited until it was free on cable. That is why I gave it 3 stars because it started pretty good but finished meh!"
1,All the funny jokes are in the commercial,And even those jokes are edited from the original firm version to make them funnier in the commercial.Awful movie.
2,Not as good as I expected,I love Jason Segal so I expected this to be pretty good. There are a few funny parts but for the most part the movie is drug out and lost my attention within the first 30 minutes. In addition the video quality was not good at all.
3,"good movie, kinda dragged",It had its funny parts and overall a good ending but it seemed to drag on in the middle. Some unnecessary events were thrown in. Overall a good movie.
3,its ok,"it was funny in the beginnign, but then got dark. seemed dragged out at those points. then a bit more humor at the end"
3,Perfectly entertaining,"A bit tedious, a bit drawn out, a bit circular in motion, but I can't say that it wasn't all I expect of a Rom-com."
2,Not worth the time,"Let's put it this way, I couldn't even be bothered to finish watching the movie and usually if I pay to rent a movie, I'll see it thru but this one just wasn't worth my time!"
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I almost didn't watch this because I had read a lot of bad reviews, but I really enjoyed it. I think it's because I often enjoy the journey more than the destination, and this movie took me on a journey. I found the characters realistic and interesting. I was thoroughly entertained by the way Jason Segel's character changed. This is not a typical romance movie with sweet, likable characters. It's a comedy with enjoyable scenes and witty dialogue. I loved it."
4,Funny Movie,The movie was FUNNY!!! My only issue with the movie was the first 20 minutes when the words didnt match the actors mouths :/ It eventually corrected itself.
2,Boring!,"I was expecting a comedy. It was actually a long, drawn-out, boring two-hour snooze-fest of a drama. Some of the scenes were so boring that I actually got up and did some odds and ends around the house while the DVD was playing. And some of the dialogue was so incredibly lame that I began fast-forwarding through a lot of it. It's a shame that good actors ended up in such a poor excuse for a movie."
3,2-1/2 stars. It was ok since there wasn't anything else to watch. M,"Mostly it dragged like a drama, then it would get ridiculously funny at times. Overall, it was cute and the two actors were superb. It was a cross between an old Jennifer Aniston flick and a Drew Barrymore comedy. Hope that helps."
1,Disappointing,This was not a comedy just a poorly written attempt at a love story gone bad. Excellent actors just a bad storyline.
1,Awful movie. Nasty.,I went into this movie thinking it would be a cute romantic comedy. wrong. It was disgusting and extremely crude. I saw this in theaters with friends and if I had driven to the movie myself I would have left the theater and not even watched the rest. I would not recommenced this to anyone. ever.
3,underwhelming rom-com,"i had high hopes for this rom-com! love the actors and the plot sounded funny, but it was a bit of a disappointment."
3,OMfG ROMCOM,"I got sucked into watching this with the spawn of satan I call my gf, but overall she seemed to enjoy it."
2,Watched this with my wife...,"My wife wanted to watch this and I reluctantly agreed. Se really liked it, found it funny and generally a decent romantic comedy. I never got into it. The basic plot just did not grab me so the rest of the movie just kind of went blah for me. I wish I could give a better description but really I just lost interest in the first 20 minutes and rest is a blur when I try to remember it.One thing I can add is that we rented this on Amazon Video and continue to have a great experience with it. We use a PS3 as our Blu-ray and ome media player."
2,Just not funny,This movie too long and poorly edited. There was much that should have been cut out. I liked the start but it got boring and tedious quickly. There were some moments that I softly chuckled but nothing really made me laugh. I cringed for the actors involved.The message of the movie was also horrible. This is why so many people get divorced!
2,Not what I expected,Wouldn't have finished watching the movie if I hadn't paid for it. Thought it was supposed to be funny but it was a downer.
2,I expected more.,"I love Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. There was just no chemistry between them; at least I didn't feel it. ""I Love You Man"" was awful too. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was somewhat OK. I don't know if Jason is cut out to be a leading man. He's funny in other movies where he is not the main character."
2,Wasn't that funny...,"I really like Jason Segel and I really liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but this one just isn't nearly as good. Not all that funny, a little dark... I think it might have been a directing / casting issue."
1,not funny,"something wrong with this movie it is not funny! good idea not well developed, missing timings and comic rhythm, not good"
1,Boring....,"I was so looking forward to this movie because I love these actors...but, it was long and boring! It wasn't funny or a drama...it was awkward and weird. Disappointed..."
1,Worst movies,My girlfriend insisted on me watching this piece even against my wishes. I would have rather had my testicles smashed with a cement block dropped from a two story building.
1,Disappointed,Don't waste your time with this one. The funniest parts were in the trailers and it doesn't get good until the last 20 minutes or so. It's a shame too because I like the actors and was looking forward to seeing it.
1,BAD,"Come on Jason Segel... you're better than this! Such a disappointment. Just awkward and depressing. Even the ending couldn't make up for the train wreck that was the entire beginning, middle and 10 minutes until the end."
1,This movie was gross,"The story line could have been entertaining, but the movie itself was gross. Too many references to disgusting behavior, etc. The acting was sub-par. While I think Emily Blunt is a good actress, this movie was not worth the time or the $$. Don't waste your time."
2,"A lot of promise, waisted.","Started great, but eventually lost the thread and the plot fell apart and there wasn't much to keep it going...surprised we finished the movie, hah."
2,Way too long. Would have been fine and just as funny with forty less minutes.,Not a bad movie but better decisions about cutting the redundant pieces of the film. Actors worked well together but pushing it with the same humor and carrying storyline for so long. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy.
1,Too Long,"Way too long and many tired old jokes, not sure why Emily Blunt would want to do this movie. It just wasn't the least bit funny."
1,Worst movie ever,I was hoping to have a nice afternoon on the couch with no husband or kids and watch this movie. Holy crap it was absolutely freaking awful. Do not waste your time or money on this.
1,Worst Movie Ive ever rented!,This movie went on and on. I thought it would be funny but it wasnt. It mostly just had an unending plot line with no climax and no humor. I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life I will never get back.
2,Meh,"Expected more from these talented people, very disappointing movie. Sorry I paid for the rental, better than a root canal, silver lining."
2,mix of terrific & awful,I loved parts of this a lot - Blunt & Segel have an easy chemistry that seemed very real and appealing.Some parts of it were awful or went on far too long. The director/editor should have shortened them or cut them altogether.Wish I had rented rather than bought this monstrosity.
2,"overall boring, has some funny moments but not Jason Segel's best",Not up to the same level as other recent Jason Segel comedies. Has a few funny moments but very slow in the middle. Watch Sarah Marshall again instead.
2,maybe we had high expectations,"their relationship was super quirky which was fun but a little hard to believe and by the middle of the movie everything got realllly weird and not at all believable.. a few good funny moments, but not worth the whole investment.."
