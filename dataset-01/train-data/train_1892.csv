3,"OK read, disappointing on accuracy","Although the author does a good job in creating empathetic characters, his depiction of his Iranian characters are wanting. They are two-dimensional stereotypes. In addition, the tranliteration mistakes when dealing with Iran make for a very frustrating read. The author and the publisher would have done well to have someone who knows Persian to have read the book to avoid embarassing and sophmoric mistakes"
3,House of Sand and Fog,"House of Sand and Fog is a nice read that starts strong but whithers as the story concludes. The characters become cliche as the story develops. While I felt strongly about the characters initially, by the end of the book I felt as if they were the stars of a ""movie of the week""."
1,This is the last Oprah recommended book I will ever read!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters' lives are totally unbelievable. I felt sorry for their stupidity, and obviously wondered about my own in finishing the book. I felt very heavyhearted knowing that anyone could have even survived writing all of this tragedy in one novel. After reading the last page my sadness turned to anger in having wasted my time reading such a ridiculous story."
1,House of Weak Ending,I loved the book until the last few chapters. The book ended like the author was in a hurry to close it and wrote a very weak ending. I was angry that the ending was such a let down and so stupid because the rest of the book was so enthralling. I will never trust reading anything by this author again.
5,Engrossing,"Couldn't put the book down. Grabbed me from the first page and held me through to the end. Was wishing for a happy resolution, but suspected it was not to be. Loved the characters and the way each described their feelings. All said, a great read."
4,Almost - not quite,"I can't give it a 5-star because I did walk away a little confused - Kathy's relationship with her mother was confusing to me. Other than that, the story is powerful and compelling - and in spite of the tragedy in all these lives, I had to keep reading. (And I generally prefer an ""uplifting read"" rather than these downhill courses.)"
3,Proceed With Caution,"Ladies, consider this a disclaimer for Andre Debuse's highly irritating, unsatisfactory novel House of Sand and Fog. In his book, Debuse depicts the life of sleazy Kathy Nicolo and a desperate Iranian family as they both claim ownership on the same seaside home. The novel is cluttered with needless sexual references and entertains an offbeat, offensive attitude towards women. Themes of male superiority and feminine dependance are present throughout the book. To add to the overall negative tone of the book, it also has an utterly uncalled for, enraging ending. Complete let down. However, that is not to say this book does not draw one into its own ugly web of adultery, fornication, and crookedness. The turning pages brought this reader closer to seeing through eyes I would rather not see through. It unfortunate that this promising author has bestowed to us such a dark, needless book. Oh well, Oprah liked it."
1,Simply Pathetic,"House of Sand and Fog is one book that readers should always avoid. Reading it is simply wasting of time. I started reading it to find out who exactly gets the house. But the conclusion was simply disappointing. I felt like stupid to read it till the end. The first part of the book was really interesting, but when I went to the second part, it turned out to be boring than ever. And also there was too much stretching in the conclusion. Dubus was not really coming to the point. He just left it incomplete. As far as I think, Dubus just tried to show how much he was capable of saying the story from two people's point of view. Unfortunately, it was nothing but a disaster."
2,Depressingly prosaic,"This author clearly has a gift for writing, but seems to have spent too much time in front of television dramas. Some very interesting, three-dimensional characters fall victim to a ridiculous plot. I will wait for your next novel, Mr. Dubus, because if you can bring yourself to collaborate with someone who has an interesting story to tell, I know that you can bring the characters to life."
3,disappointing,"I usually enjoy Oprah's picks, and as an American living abroad I often use her recommendations in choosing books. In this novel . Except for the Persian, I found the characters uninteresting and difficult to identify with. I had to force myself to get to the end of the story, skipping sentences and paragraphs to reach the climax which was very disappointing indeed"
3,A Fine Little Book,"Conflict set up right from the get-go makes for an easy entre and from there the story takes off thanks to DuBus' good writing and deft metaphors. Enjoyable symbolism. In many ways this book was a slice of some of my favorite authors such as Emile Zola: characters bound, by their own circumstances, to follow an inevitable path."
2,Disappointing in Every Aspect.,"From the very first paragraph, you know this book is going to be depressing. What you don't know is that it's going to be a headache to get through. Each character is shallow and has the Shakespearian-quality of making ridiculously rash decisions inevitably leading to tragic consequences. I especially found the author's attempts to mesh the Persian culture in every other sentence irritating. What bothered me the most about this novel, however, was that I felt no empathy for a single character --save for the Colonel's son--a character who was kept far in the background. The narratives were too drawn-out and ridiculously infused with self-pity. Throughout the novel, I began to despise the characters more and more, and by the action-laden end (strange because the rest of the novel took so long to pick up), I felt totally disappointed. I had expected so much more from this book because the idea was brilliant."
2,"On the whole, annoying and tiring","I must admit that I looked forward to reading some of the early chapters of the book during my lunch hour. After the first third or so, I lost interest. Then I got irritated by the repetition and boring 'tension' that the book introduced and then beat to death. Then at about the 1/2 way point I thought I would stop reading it, but compromised and spent about 5 second on each page, just to feel that I had 'read' it.The main characters are weak, selfish, pointless. The plot is thin and not very convincing. The writing is boring, and the formula of switching the character point of view from chapter to chapter got tiring (probably because the characters are so).Sorry for this low rating. I 'm fussy about my books and life is simply too short..."
3,"Fascinating, dark, gripping tale","A very interesting tale of a woman and her house, her interpersonal relationships, enormously self-destructive characters, and what happens when the main character loses the only thing she really has in her life (her San Francisco bungalow).Although I found it hard to really 'get into' The House of Sand and Fog, the more I learned about the characters, the more I wanted to read, and the more interested I became.Andre Dubus did a superb job telling both sides of the story, wanting everyone to end up living in the house together - happily. The characters were flawed, and Dubus does a wonderful job showing all sides of his characters. A depressing ending, but worth reading."
2,"Great character development, steadily eroding story...","What started out as a thickly developed, interesting story, totally destructs 2/3 of the way though. The strong, well developed cultural contrast between the 2 main character groups seemed squandered the deeper into the book I got. I was surprised to find this book had received awards. It seemed that the author became bored and decided to change the ending and take the cheap, Hollywood B movie ending route....Can you say ""movie option?"".If they do make this into a film, hopefully the script will be changed to have a more cohesive (and hopefully more positive) ending that fits the characters' development.Worth a look only to get a perspective on a naturalized citizens' view of America and as a possible model for developing and contrasting cultures though characterization..Otherwise, skip it."
2,Please give me somebody to care about in this book!,"First, this book is constructed in a unique and interesting manner that moves the plot along quickly. If you *have* to read it, as I did for a book club, you won't have any trouble turning the pages. However, if you're looking for a redeemable character to relate to, you probably won't find it. I think Dubus meant to make the main characters more sympathetic by giving each of them a voice in the novel, but it backfires. I didn't care how the problems resolved at the end - the characters' selfishness and intolerance had just exhausted me by that point."
2,the house of undeveloped characters,"to say that this book took a weird turn would definately be an understatement.I genuinley liked the characters up until about page 200,when i thought to myself,shouldn't this woman know better?It's as if Andre Dubus turned two of his main characters(Kathy and Lester)in to pshychopaths in the second half of this book,from people who were seemingly normal(at least by california standards)in the first half.Everyone likes an exciting twist in a book,an unexpected turn,but this ending was nonsense and left me very dissapointed.If anyone tells you that this book is a page turner it,s probably because they were trying to get through it faster."
2,I stopped reading halfway through,"The book started off with an interesting plot, but then it deteriorated into absurdity. The characters lost all plausability. I didn't have the desire to finish it."
3,The house of sand and fog,"What unattractive characters, in particular Kathy and Lester. They are not even sad, just and example of the unexamined life. What I did like was the way the writer was able to express the rituals and dreams of the Persian culture, and the hopes that immigrants bring with them to the United States. I hope never in my lifetime to meet people like Kathy and Lester."
3,House of sand and fog,Didn't think I would like this book but as i kept reading it became more and more interesting. Didn't expect the ending. That was a surprise.Eleanor Bryant
5,"Beautiful book, but tragic","A very tragic story with a very interesting story line. It kept my interest, I was attached to certain characters, overall, a very good book. I felt no sympathy for certain characters (kathy and lester), and the ending and the way the book was resolved was horrible."
2,suicide prevention,this was the most depressing book i have read in many years. i do not recommend it to any one who has bouts of depression. its advertised as a greek tragedy and it lives up to that.
2,"Depressing, Depressing, Depressing","I try to read all of Oprah's books, but it's getting harder and harder to start another one. Why do they all end so horribly? This was one of the most tragic books I have read. Dubus makes you care so much for the characters, and then just writes the worst possible outcomes for each of them. There is enough pain and suffering in the world today-give me something a little more upbeat!"
2,No suspension of disbelief possible,"Earth to five star people: Five stars is a rating reserved for masterpieces, which this book most assuredly is not. The characters seemed like chess pieces (or checkers, more like it) trundled around quite unsubtly in order to achieve the desired climactic result. Give this one a miss if you value your time."
2,I've lost my faith in Oprah,"I will admit that I am an Oprah fan and have read (or tried to read) every book that she has chosen. There have been a couple that I couldn't manage to muddle through and how I got through this one is beyond me. Maybe her promise that the last part of the book would be worth it. The book starts out very good then goes downhill from there. Sure, the action picks up at the end but it is sort of unbelievable. Am I the only one that noticed the authors preoccupation with breath? C'mon - that sort of detail is o.k. but in one part of the book I think we know the status of the breath of 3 characters in 2 or 3 pages. There is tea breath, tea and sugar breath, cigarette breath, alcohol and cigarette breath, etc. Enough of the breath. If you are looking for a good book to curl up with, ignore this one. It is hard to get into to and most of the plot is unbelievable."
1,A particular stereotype of gloomy contemporary fiction,"While I thought this book was well-written in some ways, I found it very predictable and not suspenseful at all. You can often see the author behind the words, thinking ""okay, this sentence is the one that'll suggest that what this character is doing is a mistake, and things will get even worse. It seemed very contrived and obvious. The violent scenes were predictably ugly, the white-trash female character had predictable sex scenes, the right wing military man was predictably conflicted, and the cop was the usual type of ""good boyfriend"" character--gruff (he's a cop) but of course sensitive-that always comes up in this sort of fiction written by soulful writers. This book could have used a sense of humor about itself. It has none. Plus, I heard the author on the radio and he's some kind of reformed, ex-macho bar fighter who sounds like he's keeping himself in check from referring to himself in the third-person royal."
2,BIG disappointment,"I was curious enough to find out what ultimately happens with the house, that I finished the book. But I found myself despising the main characters so immensely that I hoped that neither of them got the house. The repeated descriptions of Kathy and her nicotine breath and messy hair made me nauseous and made me wonder why Les wanted her so badly. I liked the wife and son very much and found myself hoping that they would get the house to the exclusion of the colonel."
5,This is a great book.,I saw the movie and enjoyed it so much I decided to read the book. It is quite interesting how much more detail is in the book. It is well worth the read.
4,Despair in motion.,"This book was extremely well written. It shows how people can get tangled up in situations where they can feel no way to escape. These characters were desperate and reached into their instinctive ways to settle issues that were hopeless to them. This author deserves praise for the portrayal of individuals so different and how tangled a web life can lead. Not up lifting, but definitely well written. I want to read more of Mr. Dubus' books. Palmeda Day"
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing.,"Perhaps it was Oprah's promise that the last 100 pp would make it all worthwhile. Perhaps it was my reluctance and stubborn nature to say that the book just wasn't a fit for me. In any event, I did stay with it despite the thin plot, unlikable characters, unbelievable ending, and unending tedium. What a waste."
3,"Well written, but.......","House of Sand and Fog is a tragic, shocking story of what happens when basically decent people can't see beyond their own limited perspectives. The Colonel can only see that acquiring and keeping this one house will solve all of his problems for finally regaining stature and succeeding in America. Kathy can only see her loss of her father's house as the Colonel's fault, not seeing her unwillingness to take any responsibility for her own life and actions and her addictive personality. Burdon can only see his own actions as justifying his love/lust for Kathy. He isn't even really listening or trying to understand Kathy. It is hard to believe that the tragedy could go to the extremes of violence that play out here. It is an extreme story, but one that stays with you."
2,Disappointing,"The book really draws you in initially and seems very realistic until it takes a bizarre twist that seems like a cynical report on Dateline or 20/20. The author just tries too hard to crush the American dream through corruption and violence. Too bad, because the yearning and disillusionment he created in the beginning of the book is the real deal."
2,Don't bother,"This book started out down and out & it just got worse from there. I couldn't believe how horrible things became. By the middle of the book, I thought it may turn out to be a good read yet. Then, the problems of these people just snowballed into disaster-- total disaster. Don't bother reading this book; it may be real life, but I'm sorry-- the ending sucked! I wanted to throw that book against the wall, I was so mad that I'd wasted my money! If you're going to read a book with real life in it, read ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" by Mitch Albom. It's real life & you actually learn something!"
2,Dark and Disturbing,This highly reccommended novel was a bit of a disappointment. Although not much of an exciting read while in the throes....it definately keeps you thinking for weeks to come. I guess that's something.....
2,Great storytelling - tragic story,"I'm giving this novel 2 stars because I'm a bit of a Pollyanna. I know life is not always pretty, but I wish it were and I would much rather read about resolutions that are beneficial to everyone and not as tragic as this one.This story is presented with great empathy toward the Iranian family -- their tale is masterfully presented. Like other reviewers, I felt the author neglected Kathy's side and didn't develop her character as sympathetically.I hope the author will pick a brighter subject next time around because he is a gifted storyteller."
1,AARGGH.,"I have long maintained that ""Dance of Demons"" was the worst fantasy novel I have ever read. Several years of reading have done nothing to dispel that notion. The overwhelming impression after reading the book is that of an overpowered uber-munchkin character running through a high-level D&D; campaign... but then, no sane DM would let this happen. One of the other reviewers actually pasted some of the extracts of the novel to prove the point. Fortunately, I have managed to blank out the memory of the terrible, terrible, prose, the nonexistent plot, and the lack of character development (unless you count leveling up and gaining new abilities as levelling).Stay away. FAR FAR away!"
3,Good but not what you'll expect!,"When I got it the first flute I tested out was the largest, which happen to be C.First of all, ALL of the flutes are labeled wrong. C was labeled A# and etc. But I fixed them on my own.Also, FLUTES are loud which is a good thing :D. The sound is quite genuine. It is a nice strong sound. They are professional flutes but only up until C. The last 3-4 flutes are basically useless.I like the sound of most of the flutes and I recommend this to anyone who is willing to stay on most scales besides going lower than C.Overall, average item. Not 100% what I expected. I expected a full set with a flutes that went lower than just C."
2,Too Big,"The camera bag does is too big! I own a 120MI, and it is like marble in a bag. I think I'm going to buy the case for the EfinaT b/c it has to be smaller. I am disappointed in the size of this bag. It does feel nice, and is well made, but the size is more then I wanted. My camera swims around in there!"
5,This is TIGHT!,Too bad Berry Gordy was aiming for a strictly pop sound while letting the songs on this CD languish in the vault. I can only hope they decide to release more of these hits from the vault. Now that BG has sold the Jobete catalog maybe we'll hear more of these gems.
5,Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!,"Every Motown artist has hundreds of unreleased recordings in the label's vaults and in some cases whole unreleased albums (in the case of the Supremes and Diana Ross about a dozen). Some of the unreleased music is better than the released music, even in the artists' opinions, but there was so much recorded and so little room for it on the market (the label couldn't have artists competing with their own records), much got put aside. It's the unknown songs that are really tantalizing, but meanwhile this collection of hits-by-artists-who-didn't-make-the-hits is fun enough. Motown needs to repackage its previous three collections of unreleased material, which appeared on L.P., into a C.D. as there's some real gems there. With luck one day someone at the label will have the vision to mine all the hidden gold."
3,harder than we thought,"As cool as this toy is meant to be, the assembly instructions are not clear enough. The instructions group too many pieces together rather than the simple, step-by-step building instructions I am used to from Lego or Playmobil. My 9 year old nephew and I together had a tough time figuring it out, especially because the colors of the pieces vary from kit to kit so it was hard to know if we were using the right pieces. He had more fun constructing his own gadgets because he got frustrated trying to figure out the instructions to build the catapult."
4,A good read,A soft scince fiction look at how immortality would affect us. Like any science this one isn't perfect and anomalies crop up. The part that truly captivated me was more how the background characters dealt with being immortal than than how he dealt w/ impending death. To be able to change jobs from doctor to engineer just because you want to. Or to learn the ancient greek dialect that Oedipus was originally written in because you have the time. That gave the story more depth and feeling than what it would've had.
5,Welcome to Kindle Galanor! I,"If you are a fan of Fantasy Adventure you will love this book. Wonderful characters, teriffic story and a good page turning read! You will enjoy this one and anxiously await the next adventures."
5,"Inspiring fantasy story, worth reading","Galanor, a strong leader in a fantasic fantasy tale, that will keep you wanting to read about his next adventure."
1,Another fraud,"This women is another fraud who is getting rich on indigenous medicine ways. The Crow people of Montana have stated that she is not an enrolled member of the tribe and neither is she of Crow ancestry. She charges people to the tune of %$1,500 to put a tent up on her property and participate in bogus ceremonies. Her website is always mysteriously under construction. Do yourself a favor and conduct thorough research on these wannabe traditionalists."
3,Brooke Medicine Eagle's Singing is an Acquired Taste,"I have listened to this CD, and found it to be o.k. What I have discovered is that either you like Ms. Medicine Eagle's singing and music or you hate it. I personally found it to be less singing and more chanting. Her voice is not the greatest, but neither is Neil Diamond's but he has sold hit songs. I believe that if you are a follower of Ms. Medicine Eagle, you will love this CD otherwise you will find it repetitive."
4,"quick, easy lunch","It's quick and easy to prepare and tastes good without too much saltiness. I like to microwave it 2 min and then stir the noodle and then another 2 min. That seems to cook the noodle softer. I like the hint of spiciness and peanut topping. Although I'm not a big fan of other Annie Chun's noodle bowls, I recommend this and would certainly buy this again."
3,this is one serving,"this is one serving. please stop trying to make it seem more healthful than it is. it is very tasteful, but is not as low fat as it seems to be trying to be. when i cannot trust you, who's next? colp"
3,"Spicey, but not much flavor","These are totally forgettable. What you really want is the Peanut Sesame Noodles which are zippier than you might think. These Kung Pao are a little bit spicier, but there is hardly any flavor past the tingle."
2,Sweet and salty noodles,"Let me just say that I had a choice between this meal and saltines and I chose the saltines. At least they don't have that overpowering sweet soy sauce taste. It was an empty meal. The cover gives a false impression of a more hardy, diverse product than that which I discovered when I opened the bland noodle package. It tasted like I was doing myself harm in the consumption of the noodle bowl; like I was dangerously close to my maximum dosage of sodium and sugar. It is cheap and its GREAT that the bowl is biodegradable. But please, make it taste like food and charge more. If I wanted to eat sweetened flour for a low price then I'd eat fast food. I'd rather pay a bit more for a good product."
4,Best History of The Faith I've read,Eerdman's strikes gold again. They have done excellent work with they're books on the Bible and Christianity in America and this one is the best. It's not dry and long like other History's of Christianity and includes pleanty of photos to keep you from being bored. If you can find a copy of this get it!
3,Didn't really meet my expectations,"This book was published in the 1970's and it shows. It tried to do too many things...lots of photos, an eclectic scrapbook feeling instead of coherence and clarity. Many topics are included, but I'll need to go to other sources to get any sense of true understanding. Just too disjointed and ""topical""."
5,CTG,"Great product. I'm supplementing this along with breast milk as I continue to nurse and it is the only formula that doesn't cause my baby to get constipated. He used to scream when he pooped and now I have a much happier baby, so we are all happier. I can't find this in any store so I'm so glad that Amazon carries this product."
4,Stirring football stories & insights into the life & times,"The most enjoyable sports book I've read since, well, ""Stirring Football Stories"", this book gives the reader not only such favorite moments in the history of the game as the winning forward pass (Dorais to Rockne, against Army), the Gipper, the Four Horsemen, and back-to-back undefeated seasons, but insights into the life and times of Notre Dame's legendary coach. Rockne championed & embodied the immigrant struggle for a place in the sun - the ""fighting Irish"" being a moniker bestowed on a polyglot group of newcomers to the American dream. On the gridiron it was possible to prove yourself - and show your talents - on an equal footing with older, more established schools and traditions. This conscious inclusion of the larger story gives this book an important place on the shelf, alongside Rockne's own unfinished autobiography, ""We Remember Rockne"", ""Knute Rockne, All American"", and other memoirs and studies."
1,Rip-off Expert,"Most of the recipes in this ""cookbook"" if that what you want to call it, were taken without the permission of the owners of those recipes, which were the hard working cooks that worked at Threadgill's in it's hay-days. The Biscuit recipe was wrestled in Claims Court by the owner.Support Independent Chefs everywhere and Put this bogus book on Your ""Do Not Buy"" List"
5,Beefheart Masterwork,"Other reviewers here have spoken positively about this recording, and I want to add my voice to the chorus. This is a real masterpiece. It's second (and a close second, at that) only to ""Trout Mask Replica."" Some of the most brutal, shocking and yet delicately beautiful music Beefheart has produced. Slashing guitars, intricate rhythms and crushing poetry. ""Sue Egypt"" and ""Making Love to a Vampire ..."" still give me a rush nearly 30 years after my first hearing. The whole recording bristles with fire and intensity.If you are considering buying this disc, you probably know something about Beefheart's music--at least, you have some idea of what you might hear. So I make this recommendation without reserve: Consider no longer. Get yourself a copy. You will not be disappointed."
3,Some parts didn't fit and it did not work when put together/,I did get the product in a good amount of time. Not some pieces did not fit like they were supposed to. Also the weight on it was not heavy enough so it would not shoot the little balls at all.
5,great,"great magazine for any designer out there! great info on upcoming design events, contests, and also lets you know what is going on in the big world around you involving design. pick it up if you are serious about design"
2,So far proved not worth the money,"The magazine was delivered to me opened, scuffed up, with pages ripped out on the inside. While this isn't indicative of the quality put into the magazine, it does show that for the money invested in a yearly subscription (six magazines), they could have at least invested in some shrink wrap.While the advertisements are interesting and provide me with some groundwork for new ideas, I feel that actual content is not substantive to warrant its cost."
1,poor customer service,"incorrect expiration date when first magazine was received. showed expiring in august 2011, shouldn't have expired until Dec. 2011. ordered subscription on Nov. 28 2010, to start in Jan. 2011. no practical correspondence with publisher, only response is ""yes we hear you"". magazine is adequate for what it is, but publisher is not customer oriented. would not recommend subscribing to this publication. buy it off of the newstand if you need it."
1,Are we having fun yet?,"I do not know who the target audience was here, but it certainly was not me, and I am a big Hayek fan. This book is way over my head. Perhaps a doctorate in economics or philosophy would make this work easier to read, but I don't think the average intelligent, interested reader will want to struggle though this material. It never comes up for air."
1,Not science,"Although some of the activities in this book are interesting, much of it is not science. Frankly, some of the science is at best not up to date, and at worst incorrect. I returned this book and would not use it as a resource. At the very least, this should be called ""Environmental Studies""."
3,A Practical Look at National Politics from an Early Utah Point of View,"This book deals with national politics from a Utah (mostly Non-Mormon) point of view. It is quite interesting focussing mainly on national politics of the time, but eventually discusses politics in the Territory of Utah. As usual it is anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy in nature."
5,The Amazing Story of the 1927 Mississippi River Flood,"This video opened my eyes to the total devastation of the 1927 Mississippi River Flood. Actual footage of the flood waters was used to display the utter destruction. Beyond the sad plight of those affected was the story of political intrigue surrounding the city of New Orleans at this time. A section of land more than a hundred square miles in diameter was sacrificed and its people displaced in order for the great city to be spared. The people were never recompensed for their loss despite promises from the governor's office.In the days prior to the New Deal, this video shows the beginnings of governmental compassion as thousands of people were displaced from their homes and a feeding program was put into place for the refugees. This video is a ""must see"" for those who live along the great Mississippi Valley and its tributaries, as well as those interested in the history of the 20th century in America."
3,Good size for runners,The size and weight of this device make it desirable for joggers or walkers. The FM reception is not as good as my old arm band FM radio. The head phone jack had a small short in it straight out of the package. Have to position the plug perfectly to prevent signal cutout. The display is very detailed and has alot of features. I'm sure they would be nice if the lettering was large enough to read!!
4,Resident Evil in 16th century Japan,That's it exactly it this is Capcom. If you have played Resident Evil then you already know the style of game play. If you don't like Resident Evil then stay away from this one. I enjoyed playing through this one.
4,Very fun game that you'll get into,"This game has really nice pre rendered backrounds and the best graphics for it's time. The moving around is easy because the camera angles don't effect how you angle yourself to move. Foward is always forward, nomatter how the camera has shifted. The puzzles aren't immpossible and the powering up system is awsome. Best survival horror game. More action. The voices aren't very good. The music makes up for it. Short, it only takes 4 and a half hours to beat. The plot is good and the levels are really cool. Extremely fun game and it is only $20."
3,Onimusha is ok,"I was really looking forward to Onimusha and i can say that I was a little disappointed. I wasnt disappointed at its graphics though. The movies and graphics are AWESOME!! What I am disappointed at is the gameplay and the storyline. I am a fan of survival horror games and I can say that this game IS NOT SCARY!! I never got scared even once. So, basically i'm giving it 3 stars because of the graphics and the movies."
4,How Good is Onimusha?,Onimusha displays some of the best graphics on the PS2 to date. The opening cinema is simply amazing and the in game graphics aren't to shabby either. As far as the gameplay goes I never thought it could be so much fun to kill demons as it is in this game. There is a pretty good variety of weapons to choose from as you progress through the game which keeps things from getting boring. The only areas this title falls short in are its length(about five or six hours the first time through) and its cliche story line(save the princess). If your a fan of the Resident Evil Series or even Tenchu this is definetly a must buy!
2,"Awsome Idea, Not that long","This game started in the right diretion. The graphis are great, gameplay is great, hell i could've kept playing just to take souls. One thing it lacked greatly,however, is difficulty. This game was way too easy, and only took me five hrs to beat. Needless to say i took this one back after beating it, and invested in a sports game."
2,Great graphics but TOO SHORT to beat the game,"I think this game has the best graphics ever for the PS2, the fighting system was excellent and sound was great too. It is really fun to kill all those monsters with your sword and perform your own ""fatalities"". But the game has a really, REALLY BAD characteristic: its length. It took me less than 4 hours to beat the game. I was VERY, VERY disappointed. I should have rented this game INSTEAD of buying it."
4,Awesome,"I really loved this game. the storyline is good, and the weapon choices are cool too. thonly thing i cant do is 1 puzzle, but thats it. 1 thing bad about it is that the graghics [aren't good] . i mean how are you supossed to kill a boss when you cant see yourself. i would highly recomend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge."
5,PLAYA'S POINT OF VIEW,"So far so good, good game great graphics , a real thinker for you beginners out there, great game to own though. I recomend it to everybody."
3,Onimu What?,"This Game was good, ending ..., story was so so, gameplay was smooth and the controls were a pain. If you are going to buy this buy it used. Do yourself that favor."
1,beautiful but boring,"Beautiful graphics and color, but pure boredom in gameplay. Control of the character is chunky and extrememly limited. I loved the change of weaponry, but absolutely hated the animated sequences. Onimusha was trying to be more of a cgi movie, than an actual game. Unless you like to sit back and watch poor movies with dubbed dialogue, stay away from this one."
3,its ok,I sort of like this game its not that bad but the control is like resident eveil I hate that control now a days and the blood was almost like it wasnt there Im not saying buckets of gore should be shooting all about but com on blood that evaperates befor it touchs the ground I guest I just didnt like this game or more like the resident eveil control just dosent do it for me any more I say rent it frist
1,This [is bad],I Dont c how anyone could like this the controls are hard and it dosen't make sense and they have these long movies and you can't jump.
1,I paid $5 for this and was disappointed.,"Good:You get a free case for the CD?Bad.No jump button.Linear game play (You use a button to access doors and stairs, what is this 1985?)Clunky controls. Its like driving an RC car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away. This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable.Did I mention no jump button?I paid $5 and would have had more fun had I kept the money and A) made a paper airplane with it or B) set it on fire and watched the delightful glow.Buy Devil May Cry 3 and have a blast. Avoid this one"
1,"Do Not Buy... Way, Way too Short!","I would love to recommend this game, but I can't-at least not at its current price. The game has a lot of great aspects to it. It has the potential to be a great game in the tradition of the Zelda's of the gaming world. Unfortunately, this game has a fatal flaw-its length. Honest to God, when I finished the game I thought that I was only through the first part. I thought okay, now onto the next stage. Instead, the game informed me that the next installment was coming soon. I felt so gypped. I even played it twice thinking I may have missed something that caused me to choose the shortest version of the game-but no. Honestly, I would rent this game on a weekend with no plans. You simply cannot afford to spend good money on a game that if it lasts you a weekend, I would be shocked. Don't buy this game. It has no replay or length value."
2,"Rent, Don't Buy","The game itself is alright but it has too many flaws to make it anygood. First of all the controls are just plain bad and the graphics aren't great either. You also can't skip automated scenes you've already seen and the storyline is nothing special. The battle system I have to admit was alright but as the for the rest of the game... Anyway, if you're interested in the game go out and rent it before you think of buying it."
4,A great game.... but better to rent?,"Ok, I have to say that this game is a hell of alot better than most games. It has the Resident Evil look and touch, but is some what better. The game has a great look to it, and is challanging to an extent. Some times the game gets really confusing and you dont know if you are doing the right thing or just running around in circles. The only flaw to the game is how fast it is to beat. I did not buy this game and i dont recomend buying this game, but rent it. I played the game for five days and beat it. So go to Blockbuster and rent this game, if you cant beat it you just miss two really cool looking demonds and an awsome ending cinematic."
4,Best game i played so far........,"I think Onimusha was best game I played so far for the PS2. It was like Resident Evil 2 but much better. I mean the controlls were pretty easy, and the cinemas were fantastic!!! The beginning cinema was breathtaking and marvelous. Plus, the story line was good. However, the game was a little short, but still it was fun. Man, i can't wait for onimusha 2!"
2,resident evil clones make me sick,"This game looked enticing...but I didn't realize from the cover that this is just a souped-up resident evil clone. Granted that the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fast, but there's not much to the game beyond that.Go to the next area, kill the monsters there (without the Resident Evil save-your-ammo-like-your-life-depends-on-it stratedgy which made Res Evil games so edgy), get the item, solve the obligatory puzzle, repeat. The 'horror' aspect of Resident Evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and not-so-challenging side.It's also REAL short.Good graphics, not so go voice overs, not too compelling storyline (save the princess...groan!).I was disappointed, but I guess I might be in the minority."
5,I wish I could give it more stars!!,"I just can't say enough good things about this game. It is definately a must own if you have a PS2. This is one of my favorite games of all time. The graphics are beautiful, the game pace is frantic, and the controls are nearly perfect. The only down side to this game is that there wasn't enough of it. I suppose they did that to leave you hankering for the sequal, I know I am."
3,"Resident Evil, Japanese Style","If you've played any game from the Resident Evil series before, most of this game will seem familiar. There is killing of undead creatures, some disgusting bosses to kill, and annoying puzzles to solve. In that regard, I was somewhat disappointed in this game, because I had heard such good things about it.The control and graphics are some of the best I have seen, patricularly the characters' faces. It almost seems like a real person's face was scanned and stuck on the character's body.All in all, a decent game if you never played Resident Evil before."
5,Very Surprised if Someone Does Not LIke This Game,"What's not to like? Easy controls, fun story (though a bit cliched), beautiful graphics, puzzles, loads of stuff to trash, the list goes on and on. My one complaint is that game is rather short. If you are at all familiar with these type of games, it won't take long to get to the end. Re-play value is moderate; I haven't yet gotten tired of the thunder attack. (...)"
3,"Impressive, but not very deep","This game is very highly rated, and I expected more out of it. The graphics are pretty good, and the ""cut scenes"" are interesting, providing a good story line, but the game play between the cut scenes is all too short.As with a lot of games with a mission, once the mission is completed the first time, a lot of the fun goes out of the game. This game is probably a better game to rent than to buy."
3,Great Story Line,"This is a great Ps2 game. The grafics are fantastic. The story line is really great too. But, the game has some flaws in it. I like the fighting system in it. I reminds me of the resident evil fighting style. The control is very difficult for players who arent used to the Resident Evil type of push foward to go backwards and left for right. The voices were cool but the lips moving totaly different with the lips was annoying. And the game was hard to play for long periods of time. The longest i played it was 30 mins in a row. It is just an average game with some really good but bad points. Good game though. Rent before you buy it."
3,"this game is good, but....","this game is ok... well, very good in concept and design.. but it has a major flaw.background isn't 3D!! as a consumer, i don't care whether it was designed originally for PS1... if it was, then, they should release it as PS1 game and take some time to re-develop it.and, since back ground isn't 3D, the control of charactor.. especially in fighting isn't so smooth..I would give it 5 Stars, if it weren't for that 2D back ground... that's a shame..."
2,bad game,"the only reason im going to give it 2 instead of one is bc of the quality of graphics but the game playing sucks .. i dont know wat is lamer walking around repetively hacking slashing the same creatures over again or the bosses who are just overgrown blowhards who take a couple of shots u need no real stradegy to beat them ...also, i dont dig the storyline or want a storyline ... i mean ur a japense ninja equiped with japense fine steel u would expect a great fighting game not some cinematic movie clips"
2,"Good, if you can get pass those ...puzzles!","This game has frustrating puzzles, and the gameplay is exactly like Devil May Cry, it's not funny. The story is so cliched, too. SAVE THE PRINCESS! Also, it's not realistic. The 1st boss is so stupid, a 3-year old could've made him. Only good thing is the graphics, but that's it."
2,"Looks good for the 1st few cut scenes,then...","when you start playing you start yawning.The problem with games with pre-rendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game. If you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all move.This kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before D. W. Griffith. Ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room. Then set the camera down in a new location and repeat.If you like games like Resident Evil or Fear Effect this game is for you. Also if you like solving awkward puzzles, this game is for you. Any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game. Like still cameras, awkward puzzles break the pacing of the game."
5,I was crazy to overlook this game!,"I always figured Onimusha games were action type stuff. I'm a big survival horror nut, so when I heard about this game being that type of playing experience I figured I had to try it. At the price it goes for I had nothing to lose.In short, this game is simply awesome. It is pretty (even for now), has a good story, is just plain fun, and pretty easy to control despite what some people have said. I pretty much tolerate games that don't have use of analog sticks (except RPGs), I hardly ever praise them. That said, I had hardly any problems adjusting to the control.The only thing bad about this game is its shortness. I played through it in about 5-6 hours (counting cutscenes), but I had a blast."
5,Onimusha,Onimusha warlords is a fantastic game. The graphics are better than most games youll ever see. The gameplay is a little similar to the resident evil series yes but who could ever get tired of hacking the most realistic looking zombies to pieces? Youll be having nightmares for weeks after this one.
4,looks great in photo's,"The wig looked really great in all the pictures that I took. It took a bit of prep work to get it to look decent (ie., a lot of picking and spraying with oil sheen), but for a ""costume"" wig and for the price it really pulled off my 70's look."
2,Solomon's Magick By Poke Runyon,"While this book had some nice information, it didn't have to have the author's personal life involved in it. Nor did it need to include information on his order etc. There was a lot of 'fat' that could have been cut and gotten to the 'meat' of the matter. As well in some of the things he is asking the readers to do will leave them open to attack. Overall, a decent book, but I think I could have done much better."
4,Good Stuff,"The author comes off as a bit of a salesman at times but perhaps that is part of his charm. I found a handful of questionable things in his book but it doesn't take away from the overall magic he discusses.I doubt that anything was truly gifted to him as far as ""re-discovery"" goes but it's scholarly innovation is extremely useful and refreshing. In addition Runyon has digested reams of older knowledge already available and placed them into an understandable format.I bought this book and the VCR tape that goes with it and I liked them both aside from the small things I listed above. You can learn much about evocation and invocation from this book and VCR tape."
5,"As straight forward as magick books get, EVER!","If this book is one thing, it's wonderfully unambiguous.You will find methods for working the Lemegeton and actually getting your evocations to work.You will find patterns for building your own proper temple in which you may speak with the old gods. I was able to build everything I needed with hand tools and materials I could get at a building supply store. There isn't any need for black rooster's blood, or even golden yesodic knife handles or any other such nonsense.And yes, I can assure you that it works, and works well. I was able to speak with Baal within a week of reading this book.Additionally, the trance methods are applicable to all kinds of magick, from a Crowley-ish set of psychodramas to an A.O. Spare sigil. And they give you some cool sex magick that also works. Actually, the sex magick that thabion teaches is a very useful tool, don't let the fact that it only takes up a tiny bit of the book fool you."
4,A magick book that shows you can think outside the box,"This book is quite easy to read and digest as far as books on this topic go. I also like how the author presents some different ideas with a variation of the arrangement of the ""demons"" and some other significant re-discoveries in the field. One thing that would have been helpful would have been some sort of appendix of acceptable substitutes when certain materials cannot be practically obtained, such as gold or mercury or a lion's pelt. Likely, it's up to the individual user, so such trivialities may not matter, but a nudge in the right direction rarely hurts. Well worth the time and money for anyone interested in this school of magick."
1,Worst puchase I've ever made on Amazon!,Does not even deserve one star! Did not get the flag pictured. Returned it. Said on the flag package that you must call to acturally get the flag pictured! What kind of a business is Wincraft anyway? If I had wanted a different one I would have ordered a different one!!!
3,WE NEED MOR OF THE HIT MAN!!!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good collection. But motown needs to put Eddie's solo albums on CD. I would love to listen to: The Hit Man, People Hold On, Eddie Kendricks, All By Myself, and Slick, on CD. All were great albums that had nothing but quality music. Eddie Kendricks left us all a legacy of great music during his solo years. It's time for that legacy to be discovered by a new generation of music fans, or to be rediscovered by us who still cling on to these albums on vinyl and want to hear EJK on CD."
1,Ultimate? Hardly!,"I was and am a true fan of the music of Eddie Kendricks throughout his years with the Temptations, and his solo career. To the producers of this collection, I say, someone is just trying to make some more money off of a talented singer who died in his prime. This is not an ""ultimate"" collection by any means. To me, to call this ""ultimate,"" one would have to make it a box-set of all, or at least most of Mr. Kendricks' solo recordings. Please, give us a better selection of his work. In fact, why not just re-release all of his albums on CD? What we have here in this ""ultimate"" collection is practically the same thing that has been previously released on the ""At His Best,"" and ""Motown Superstar Series"" collections, so what's the difference except someone is after profit? Please don't defame the memory of Eddie Kendricks with this offering!"
1,did not get item very angry,"I ordered this cd on december 31,2002, I still did not receive itI'm very disappointed, Will some one please call me or e-mail me"
4,A BLAST FROM THE PAST,"THE TEMPTATIONS WERE NEVER THE SAME AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR TWO ""VOICES"", EDDIE KENDRICKS AND DAVID RUFFIN. THIS CD FEATURES EDDIE'S SOLO OUTPUT FROM THE EARLY 70'S WHEN DISCO WAS MAKING ITS' BREAKTHROUGH. WHAT A VOICE! I COULD NEVER MAKE UP MY MIND WHO SANG THE BETTER FALSETTO, EDDIE KENDRICKS OR CURTIS MAYFIELD, BUT WHO CARES? THEY WERE BOTH AWESOME. SOME OF THE SONGS MAY BE JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO DISCO-ISH FOR MY TASTE, BUT YOU CAN NOT DENY THE TALENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEAR CLASSICS LIKE ""BOOGIE DOWN BABY"", ""KEEP ON TRUCKIN"", OR ""GOING UP IN SMOKE"". I ALSO HAVE THE ""ULTIMATE COLLECTION"" FROM DAVID RUFFIN, AND THAT ONE IS GOOD AS WELL."
4,A Nice Trip Down Memory Lane,"I heard songs I had forgotten about, including some memorable religious ones. I sang all the way home in my car!"
3,"Great music, but it did not meet my expectations.","I was disappointed in the collection; I gave it 3 stars because, as always, I truly enjoy Eddie's music. I feel that neither the write-up or pictures did Eddie justice. I would like for the collection to have included music you don't find on other CDs, such as Memories and Day By Day. I would really like to see some of his old albums re-released, especially My People Hold On."
3,Ok butt...,"I love this artist, but this must have been recorded on DVD before digital remastering. The sound is not so good."
2,Not my best buy,I really have not enjoyed this album. I listened to it once. Eddie was recommended to me by a friend of mine. Iam not really into this album. It could have been better. Maybe I need to listen to it a few times in order to get use to the style of music. I will try and lsiten again. but for now I will stick to my 2 stars.
4,GOOD GAME,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS A KILLER GAME THE GRAPHICS ARE THE BOMB ,BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT GETS BORING REAL QUICK I MEAN NOT ALL THAT QUICK THERES SECRET JUMPS WHERE YOU CAN FIND SHORT CUTS TO WIN THE RACE CAUSE YOU HAVE TO WIN 3 RACES IN A ROW IF YOU DONT YA HAVE TO START ALL OVER FROM THE FIRST ONE AFTER YOU BEAT ALL THREE YOU ADVANCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL IF I REMBER RIGHT THERES SEVEN BUT YOU HAVE TO BE REAL QUICK CAUSE THE OPPONENTS ARE FAST AS LIGHTNING IM SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS ONE ."
4,ssx snowboarder,"I BOUGHT THIS GAME AT TOYS ARE US I WAS WEART AT FIRST BUT ONCE I TOOK IT HOME I WAS SUPPRISED CAUSE IM NOT MUCH IN TO SNOWBOARDING GAMES BUT THIS ONE WAS THE BOMB KILLER GRAPHICS,ALOT OF TRICKS, YOU CAN COUSTOMEIZE YOURE PLAYER,BOARDS ETC, AND ITS REALY FAST NOT PHONY AT ALL I JUST GOT DONE PLAYING THIS GAME FOR 5 HRS AND WANNA SIGHN OF THE PC SO I CANT GO BACK AND PALY IT AND MASTER MORE TRICKS I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME."
2,This game is not for beginers,This game is tough. I dont like it very much for a couple reasons. I have judged it over 180 snowboarding. It is nothing like it. 2 it is so complicated. There are so many controls and 3 there isnt much action. I suggest espn x games snow boarding.
1,horrible,this game is bad the first level is literaly imppsooble who wants a game where they cant beat the first level
4,A Great Game,"I loved SSX, It is a great snowboarding game.The graphics are fast and, I find it easier to control than ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding... However if you're looking for many different modes of play, X Games is the way to go. For the money, you should get this game..not a must have, but its fun!"
5,As tony the tiger would say...... GRRRRRREAT!!!!,"I love this game. I got it last Christmas with my PS2. I love playing this game. It's not one of those games you just get sick of, the is lots to do! You can take a practice run to practice your tricks, a freeride to check out the mountain, competition, and MORE!!! You choose your player and theur clothes and snowboard. You can also do tricks to earn points and eventually get to better slopes and stuff like that. GREAT GAME!! I completely recommend it!! Go Buy it!"
5,This game is awesome!,"I must admit, I'm not really into the whole snowboarding game genre as far as video games are concerned. Until I was able to play a pre-released version of this game that is. Not only does this game look as good as any of the PS2 luanch titles, but it's oh so fun! Everything about the gameplay is amazing, from the tricks you can perform to the sense of speed you get as you're racing down the hills, and the attention to detail is top notch. It's not you're typical boring snowboarding game where you just race down mountains or slopes-have you ever snowboarded through skyscrapers in New York? This game is a good buy with your PS2 at luanch."
5,Essential to PS2,"This game is great graphically and in gameplay. The learning curve is a bit difficult, but you will be rewarded after a few training sessions. What makes this game so great is its many options which are similar to the Tony Hawke series. This is the best Snowboarding game ever! There are so many jaw-dropping tricks and camera angles that will keep you from leaving your seat. The snow is even given close attention to detail for the fact that when you carve the ice, your trail is left behind due to the movements that you make. Unlike a lot of other games out there, you will not get tired of the many choices of music the game has to offer. If you do not have this game, then you are not unlocking the greatness of the PS2."
5,TALK ABOUT COOL,"This is defently the best snowboarding game ever. It's way better than all the cool boarders. It has great graphics. It's very detaled. You can go way off the course and find shortcuts. Along with cool tricks, like back/front flips, spins and a bunch of grabs. The object of the game is to win a metal (top 3, gold, silver, and bronze). With any metal you get a new course. With gold you get a new rider and board. Thats only with races. But with freestyle you must get X amount of points by doing tricks to get a metal. Also with metals you rider becomes better. I recomend this game to every gamer. It has everything. This is a game that you will keep playing and playing not just play for a week and never play it again. Overall it's one of the top games for ps2 and I recomend this game."
5,The best PS2 game so far,"SSX was one of the first games I bought for my playstation 2 and in my opinion it is still the best PS2 game out there. SSX is a great game for many reasons, it has spectacular graphics, you can perform a countless number of tricks and the race courses allow you to travel off course. SSX allows you to have a regular race or to race for stunt points. The regular races are fairly easy after you have played the game for a while but earning a gold medal in the stunt races it pretty hard. The game gives you alot of goals to shoot for, by winning races you can unlock new characters. Each charater also has a list of 40 different tricks that as you complete them you earn different outfits. The outfits aren't anything spectacular but trying to complete all of the tricks is extremly difficult and will keep you playing for hours. Overall I think this game is a must have for any PS2 owner whether your a snowboarder or not."
5,SSX is super FUN ! Great game.,"SSX is a funfilled, fantastic ride. It reminds me of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for PS1. The graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is solid. I especially enjoyed the multiplayer mode."
5,SSX still rocks,"One of the first games out for the PS2 is still a classic. Though the sequel to this game, SSX Tricky, has better characters and better tracks, I still go back to the original since it is more challenging in many aspects.Now that it is cheaper, it is pretty much a toss-up wheather to buy SSX or SSX Tricky. Buy them both!!"
5,No Comparison,Until SSX Snowboarding... EA Sports NHL (any year) was the greatest sports game... WROOOOOOOOOOOOONG !!!!!!! So I said just buy NHL '02... make sure you have TWO games in the collection. THIS and NHL.
5,If you buy one game for the PS2...,"This should be it.Of the four I own, (SSX,Tekken,Madden,Midnight Club) this one gets played more than the other three combined. It's so much fun that my wife loves it too. People who come over to play with the PS2 keep coming back to this one over the others. If you're waffling on which one to pick up for X-Mas...Stop. Click on ""Add to cart"" And settle back to wait for one of the best games I've had the pleasure to play in a LONG time."
3,This game is awsome!,This game is fun....the graphics are great! I rented this game and beat it.Like i said i rented it and beat it.It got boring fast.....i beat it with all the secret chars and all the other stuff.Great game! Rent it dont buy it because it gets broing really fast.
3,"pretty good, but could be better if...","When I first rented this game, I thought it was pretty cool. The graphics were tight and the colors and attention to detail in the gameplay were excellent. There was only one problem. I couldn't get past the first level. I played all day and nothing. I think that if the game was a little bit easier I would love it to death. It was near impossible to place in the first level's final heat. I strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes snowboarding or just cool games in general. But be warned, you're in for a lot of frustration."
4,[Snowboard Supercross],WOW! If your looking for any type of ridgid top of the line sports game you must get this. I gave it 4 stars because I do not yet have a memory card and it gets kind of boring. But.. WITH A MEMORY CARD this game will be out of hand. The Grafics are 10/10. the Game is 10/10. No slow pictures or hold ups. This game keeps you busy.Again You must buy!
5,I am very happy that I bought SSX,"SSX is the Playstation 2 system seller game. It is the game that makes the system worth buying. It is a really fun game. I was somewhat sceptical about getting this game, but folks I knew said it was fun, and it turns out that it really is the best game that I have played so far. I really enjoy playing it, and have stayed up way too late playing it a number of times. This game is very good, the only things that have bothered me so far are; I think the game ""cheats"" a little bit to make it challenging for the player. I love the characters and the different ways they can win. I would say that the game is challenging, and definitly worth the effort to learn how to ride the rails, and do super cool tricks."
5,The best looking game so far...,"I usually do not get into extreme sports type of games, but after seeing all the positive reviews for SSX, I decided to give it a try.I was hooked!The graphics in this game are absolutely incredible! The gameplay is smooth. It is very easy to learn to play, and one look at all the tricks that are available to learn and you will see that you can play this for a long time!I'll admit, though, that I did cheat and look up the codes for SSX ... so I could unlock all the courses. The final course has to be played to be believed!If you're not sure if you'll like this, give it a rent, then come back here to buy it, because you'll be hooked as well!"
5,ULTIMATE FUN!,"OH MY GOD...when you combine MIND-BLOWING GRAPHICS with INCREDIBLE FUNFILLED GAMING you know YOU HAVE MAde history with a game..SSX HAS DONE THIS. THe levels are SO cool to look at , they are designed so beautifully...and it is the type of game that you wont get bored of playing. BOOYA! get this game , and thats the bottom line cuz OLGA said so"
5,The Most GNARLY,"As I said in the title of this review, this is the GNARLIEST game ever! This was the first game I got with the almighty Playstation 2. And is still my favorite. The quest for all golds never ceases to amaze. I don't even care about saving cuz going for golds every time never ceases to amaze. I would rate this higher than ZOE or anything else. The only game that may be as fun is Crazy Taxi. If you are thinking about getting a PS2 or have one but don't have this title, GET IT!!! You will NOT be disapointed with your purchase. ELISE is a hottie!"
5,One of the Best!,"SSX is a fantastic game, I highly recommend it.Nothing compares with flying down a mountain at breakneck speeds, all the while busting out insane, over-the-top tricks.The tricks actually mean something, too. They provide you with boost, thus allowing you to go faster.There is a slight amount of slowdown, especially on the Mesablanca track. But it's not a big deal.If you can only have one game for PS2, get Onimusha.If you could have two games, get SSX!"
5,Great Buy,Overall the game is a blast. The graphics and feel are very good and realistic. Some of the moves are difficult to complete easily. Going out of the suggested path can provide beneficial results. Fun factor is great.
4,Almost as good as the arcade,"If PS2 had a pair of skies you could stand on like the arcade, that would be the only way they could improve the playablility of this to compete with the arcade versions."
5,This game ROCKS!,"Wow! At first I thought well, I am not a very big snowboarding fan but I have heard good things about it. And if you are questioning the same thing you need to buy it. It has levels for racing only, levels for showoff (pull off sick tricks) only, warmup levels, and freestyle levels. Some levels are in more than one catagory but there are still many different ones. No glitches, now that is amazing! You can pull off tricks anywhere from a mute to a triple rodeo 900 experimental air! You MUST buy this game. It is really worth it!"
1,Tarrantino by the Numbers,"First disabuse yourself of the notion that this is a movie about hit women. They are three babes packing heat, but they have no clue how to do the job they have been assigned. Director Aaron Harvey delivers paint by numbers Tarrantino that officially clocks in at 94 minutes but seems to last twice as long. Harvey never misses an opportunity to slow the action down to a crawl and his screenplay makes no sense at all. Bruce Willis is annoyingly quirky but true awful acting honors fall to Forrest Whittaker."
2,...,"it was weird... i couldn't stand forest whitaker with his mexican accent, what the hell was that about ? part of the movie ? i would have been the same without his damn accent, anyway the film was wack, Bruce Willis was in it for like 20minutes only."
4,Tarantino-lite but FUN,"I enjoyed this Catch .44 movie but while the fun dialogue and snappy action reminded me of Tarantino a whole bunch, the great cast made me want to keep watching.Another of my favorite movies is the Big Sleep and when you come down to that story, there are holes in it you could drive a truck through, very much like this but never dull and a fun picture.The cast is great, full of several established actors and some newer ones that I expect to see more in the future.The picture looks great and has a great soundtrack,lots of old favorites. There isn't much in the way of extras on the DVD, just an audio commentary track by the Writer/Director & Editor and Spanish soundtrack.I can see myself watching this again in six months and perhaps the story will make more sense to me on the second viewing.It's worth checking out and I'm glad I did."
1,Stuck in a Rut,"The overall storyline had some potential but failed due to really fragmented pieces amongst which was the scene of our three women holding up a diner which was repeated/looped so many times as the story progressed that it felt like it occupied half of the movie. The background of the girls provided almost zero insight into their characters other than they liked to argue over nothing which occupied another 25% of the movie. The final 25% was Willis, who this past decade or so is just stuck in a rut in repeating his patented, conditioned to sell but admittedly provides a great income for limited on-set time, bad-ass behavior that has gotten so old it feels like grandpa reliving his youthful fantasies."
3,A disappointment considering the acting talent in this,"As others have mentioned, this does seem like a ripoff of Quentin Tarantino. It's not the worst film I've seen, but it lacks characters you want to relate to, and there are scenes that jus5 don't tie in to the core of the film. Forest Whitaker does the best he can with a rather lame script and I'd say that his presence is the one redeeming point to the film."
1,Terrible,"Implausible and overly violent; Bruce Willis looks gaunt (cancer?). 'Plot' involves drug-running, revenge for a botched job, a double-cross, and a few people caught in the middle. I'm surprised that such a low-grade movie would involve a high-value actor."
2,Not worth the $3.99,This movie looked like it was trying to be a Pulp Fiction imitator but failed miserably. Not the worst movie I've seen and nowhere near the best. Oh well live and learn!
3,Mixed reviews,"Interesting little, low budget film. The commentary fills in the blanks. You understand it better.The actors did a good job considering they did not have a lot of material to work with.Forest Whitaker was exceptional. Bruce Willis was not in many scenes.Sort of a pulp fiction feel.Worth seeing if you want a change of pace. I bought it for 5 bucks at FYE so seeing it's 12 bucks here. I got a deal. I would not pay more than 5 bucks for this movie."
3,"Quentin Tarantino Knock-Off, and not all bad","The director of Catch .44 really, really, really wants this to be the next Pulp Fiction. Not only does he not get the same performance from Willis, the film itself suffers from a ""been-there-done-that"" vibe. What's good here, though, is that the film does solicit strong performances from some very underrated actresses. Forrest Whitaker and Bruce Willis spend the film chewing scenery, though. All-and-all, it's an average (perhaps an above average) film when compared to what else is out there."
3,A fun and entertaining movie!,"Now you must consider some dark humor and gore to be fun... so my title might be a little misleading.The acting is good not Oscar winning, definitely a movie with a twist... therefore the name...i don't want to give it away during this review but will definitely say that I had fun watching it and would watch it again at least one more time. Not the kind of movie that you can watch over and over because once you know the plot it loses its effectiveness.That being said I give 3 starts as I would consider it to be a good movie but not a great or extraordinary movie."
1,for stupid people only,Almost the entire movie is people conversing in silly ways. In one scene two people point their guns at each other for about one half hour as if it were a standoff. But they often look away from each other while they do it! This is unrealistic and unbelievable trash.
2,Not worth your time,"This one is probably not worth your time. It begins with a scene of 4 girls in a country diner and escalates to a shooting scene. It's a movie that jumps around in time a bit (back and forth to a certain shoot out scene.) Everybody is a thief and a liar, trying to steal from each other and out to kill somebody. Drugs and money are also involved. Bruce Willis is some kind of crime lord and his part is really not very impressive. The only one who really does a good job in the film is Forrest Whittaker. He does an excellent job with his part in this lousy movie.There is lots of blood, murder, foul language (""F"" every couple of words) and doublecross. Unless you are seriously bored,don't waste your time with this movie."
2,Lousy Pulp Fiction/Death Proof wanna-be,Misguided attempt to be hip is derailed by a TERRIBLE script derivative of Tarantino's Death Proof and Pulp Fiction. The theme involves a group of female assassins whose conversation is very similar to conversations in Death Proof. A better version of this theme is in the 2006 movie Smokin' Aces. Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker are wasted talent in this small budget production. Avoid this movie; there's better out there.
1,Bad Movie,"I can't believe that Bruce Willis would play in this very bad movie and he looks like he just got out of Bed and looks drunk all the time No class at all and the story line is not their and the movie jumps around way to much and so Bruce Willis should go hide in shame to have made this awful movie But I did love the Girls the only thing good about the movie. Don't pay to watch it ok rent some other movie like The Planet of the Apes"" Very good Movie."
1,WASTE OF TIME OR MONEY,This movie has got to be the worst one I have seen in a very long time!!! Bruce Willis only has a bit part and looked terrible. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
1,Tarantino wannabe... pass it's a snoozer.,I don't know how the director/producer conned such acting talent into doing this waste of time/money. I paid $1 to rent it and still felt ripped off. The acting isn't bad but the story is weak and the dialogue wants to be Reservoir Dogs... not even close. This movie is hackie. 7 recognizable great-good actors what a waste of talent.
1,what a load of,i love bruce willis from moonlighting to the movies but THIS. he appeared then disappeared for approx;50 mins.returned for a second bout.then disappeared again.until the end when he got shot.it looks as if he made it for the money and between golf shots. it was like CASINO so much swearing.the writers cant write a sentenceif half is not swear words not oscar worthy. i just hope he was paid enough.the cuz
1,Love Bruce... hated the movie,"Bruce Willis is my favorite actor hands down but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Bruce and Forest Whitaker both do an excellent job with their characters but I'm still trying to figure out how they possibly read the script and said ""SIGN ME UP! I'd like to do that movie""? And I'll never get that 93 minutes of my life back."
2,Lots of Potential But Way Too Self-Conscious,"I totally did not hate this film. The art direction is outstanding, especially in the claustrophobic diner and the gas station, but also in Mel's mission-cum modern den, which perfectly reflected my confusion about this movie's attempts to straddle eras and genres. The soundtrack, which includes the Kills, the Sweet, and Johnny Preston, is just as eclectic and confused. Great music, but awkwardly cobbled together.I don't begrudge this film its influences, but, again, combining Taratino's gimmicky visuals with Kevin Smith's over-written dialogue produces an overall effect that I think might be a bit more clumsy than what was intended, and what you end up with is the cinematic equivalent of an emo-hipster whose anachronistic facial hair ruins every bit of irony he was going for with the members only jacket."
3,Bizarrely Entertaining,"Catch .44 is bizarrely entertaining. The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks that take the original scene further and further until the film's conclusion. The stellar performance by Academy Award winning actor Forest Whitaker make the film worth watching. The story is weak and the plot is bloody and senseless. Shea Whigham, Nucky Thompson's brother (the Sherriff in Boardwalk Empire), also displays his acting chops in the film. While the credits list Bruce Willis as one of the films ""stars,"" he has a minor role as a pecan devouring bad guy. There are no likeable characters in this script but plenty of gratuitous violence and lots of twists and turns."
1,Terrible! Awful! Waste of Time!,One of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen (and I'm very easily entertained).Bruce must have been bored one weekend and did this to kill some time. Don't bother.
1,One of the worst ever seen,"Masterpiece of boring over 90 minutes expecting something and then, suddenly it all ends in about 2 minutes or less.Save your money, if courious rent it."
1,Horrible Movie,"The music is good in this movie, but that's about it! What a waste of $3.99 to rent this, I should have waited until it hit cable, if it ever would. Its such a shame, Bruce Willis is such a great actor, but this movie was one of the worst I have seen."
1,Colossal Epic Fail,"Ill cut to the chase, this movie is just plain bad. Bad plot, bad acting, unnecessarily bad language horrible accents. 25% takes place in a car, 75% takes place in a bar. The only reason I watched pass 10 min is because I thought I was confused. The only reason I watch pass 30 minutes is because I wanted to see if the movie could get any worse. And you know what? It did!"
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I ignored the low reviews... H'm - I can't find words to describe the failure of this movie... Why would Bruce even accept to act in this piece of garbage?When was shooting for no reason, no script, no story, poorest acting ever... make a movie?Do yourself a favor, go take a nap instead."
1,Just...bad,"I was excited to watch a new Bruce Willis / Forest Whitaker movie...until I popped this in and realized it's not really a Willis/Whitaker movie. It's a Malin Akerman movie MARKETED as a Willis/Whitaker movie.And even that would be fine if this movie was any good. But it's not. Weak dialogue, bland characters, and a throwaway storyline that's trying to be all tough-guy/Tarantino-ish in the same way 5th-grade schoolboys try to be tough when they're bullying the 1st-graders. Bullets fly artfully, people cuss poorly, the camera slow-mos at properly ""dramatic"" moments.... <yawn>I've seen Akerman in a couple other movies, most notably ""Watchman,"" and I'm sure she was excited for the chance to take a leading role in a beat-'em-up action flick, but this thing is just a boring mess. Don't bother."
2,Not for me,"Usually I don't follow the hype of poorly reviewed movies. However, there are some times when that hype is on-point. With this movie it is as bad as people have perviously stated. With the movie cover you expect Bruce Willis to have a larger part and carry the movie. Nope. With the three ladies and their drug transaction it comes as a watered down impersonation of Pulp Fiction. Or as I like to refer to it, ""This is the poor man's Wendy.""I wish I had the time back that I donated to watching this movie. If you MUST watch this movie rent from a red box for a dollar. Do not spend more than a dollar on this movie"
1,Don't waste your time,"I rented this as you usually can't go wrong with Bruce Willis and Forrest Whitaker. How wrong I was. None of the characters are likable and by the end, I wished they would all die. Also, for a short movie, it seems there were a few scenes just to stretch it out. For example showing the girls driving around with loud music and smoking. 10 seconds of that was enough to get the feel for the scene. It seemed like it dragged on for 3-4 minutes. I fell asleep during part of one of those long drawn out scenes.I can only assume Wills and Whitaker did this for the money. It is awful!"
2,Save your money,"Poorly written, shallow characters, it tries to be like ""Pulp Fiction"" but is just pulpy. Lots of good actors whose talents are wasted."
2,Saccharine,"I'm with chilirlw. Not only is the hyperbole about Sara's magnetism tiresome, it's also cloying. I'm an LMM fan and have read almost all her books except the 'Sara' ones. I've always found her tales nostalgic and innocent but always on the right side of sentiment-not overdone. Here the sugar turns saccharine. The Story Girl, with her improbable nickname, mouths such unlikely gems as, ""Where are you, children?"" when trying to find her best friends. I highly doubt evev children of the time referred to each other as ""children."" Dialogue is stilted and weird. The constant stories of the eponymous girl are tiresome and interrupt the flow of the main storyline, such as it is. Read Anne or Emily or Pat over and over again and save youself from this one."
5,Enjoyable and gentle read,I enjoyed this book as much as I did the Anne of Green Gables series. It was a gentle look at another time and another place.
2,too different,"I love the author and have read and reread her books. But I did not like this one. I don't think you should review a book you did not read, but I read enough of this one to have a opinion, but I did not finish it. Why, I didn't like it. I kept at it but just didn't finish it. Why, I felt no warmth or humbleness, in the character of the story girl. After being use to reading Anne, who did not feel herself wonderful, this was a big change. I didn't get involved with the whole story, but it did have what we expect from this author. A book adults can love and yet a book you would read to children"
3,Story girl review,Very sweet story concerning the lives of group of children growing up in the Maritime s of Canada. Good reading for early ages and some teens.
3,The Story Girl,"I was so excited to find this book here on Amazon after a friend was saying she had been looking for it for a while. I ordered it and it took more than a month to get here - which was within the delivery time however anything else i've ever ordered from Amazon is usually delivered within 2 weeks - when it did arrive i was dissapointed to find that it had a black and white ill fitting dust jacket, it wasn't even a photocopy of the original it looked as though it had been printed (poorly) from a computer, the pages also have this look about them but i'm not going to return it as i've told my friend that I surprise comming for her and it took so long to get here in the first place. I will have to just give her the book without the dust jacket (and apologise) I was't very impressed. I hope the fact that my frien has been waiting for this book for so long makes up for the terrible presentation."
2,mystical,"For entertainment value, I would give this book 3.5*. It was ruined for me, however, because of all the mentions of ghosts, witches, incorrect theology and hints of Eastern mysticism. Even though it was entertaining, I won't read it again because of that. It also seemed rather shallow compared with Anne of Green Gables and other similar books."
1,Story Girl - Classic Reprint,I doubt this has a legal copyright. Would give less than a 1 star if possible. It is a blown up copy of the original book. Extremely poor quality.
5,Sara Will Mesmerise You!,"A charming story by LLM, one of my all time favorite authors, about tow boys who visit for the first time their Canadian cousins and their friends. Sara is a master story teller and keeps the gang rivited throughout the novel with her wonderful storytelling. If you are an avid reader of LMM you may recognize some of the stories in the book, but there is plenty of novel things like the praying contest and the day the world ended. i hope I peaked your interest in this book. This is a book for everyone from child to adult. It's a story you will cherish and read over and over. Pass it on to your children and grandchildren!"
1,Great Book- bad binding,I opted to go cheap and buy the paper back. I ordered this for my daughter. She's been reading it for three days and already the pages are falling out. I've never seen that happen so quickly in a paper back. The glue seems brittle and cracks when you open the book. Good lesson for next time. But the story is wonderful.
5,Sweet.,"Still the sweetest love story ever told. I loved re-reading it after many years, and love having it on my Kindle to read again no matter where I am....just so I have my Knindle with me."
1,Non-existant support and no linux drivers,"Twice I've requested support via their web page and twice they've ignored it. No linux drivers (get an Intel - they are working on drivers for their cards). Uses secretive and, in my opinion, obsolete TI chip. Don't go anywhere near this turkey or anything else from USR (or TI)."
5,Good documentary for the price,"This film is by far the best documentary on the subject of Groom Lake that I have ever seen. I got it new for only a dollar and was surprised at how much evidence the director sites for the claims that are made in the film. The quality of the editing was so so, however the content of the personal interviews and the amount of factual evidence were compelling. This documentary does not make you say ""well now I believe it all"", but it does challenge the long held belief that nothing out of this world happens at Groom Lake."
2,Not quite what I was expecting...be forewarned,"If you are buying this muffler expecting a perforated core, fiberglass packed straight through style of muffler like ALL the other Ultra-Flo mufflers, take note: It isn't.This muffler is one of the stranger ones I've ever seen. On either end of the muffler, right inside the inlets, there is a short perforated section, maybe 4"" long or so. These sections are surrounded by fiberglass packing.Beyond this, however, in the center of the muffler, it just opens up into a very large, open chamber with nothing in it.Whether this open area is supposed to act as a resonator of some sort, I really don't know. What I do know is that this muffler does very little muffling.So, if you're looking for a loud muffler, this will do the trick. But then, if you're looking for a loud muffler, you're probably not looking for some huge bulky muffler like this thing, are you? If you're looking for a quiet muffler (like I was), keep looking, because this isn't it."
5,luv this drama,"the material was delivered on time & in good condition. i've watched the drama 3X already & still want to watch it. i like kim rae won, he is ruggedly handsome in this drama, i just ordered his other drama Love Story in Harvard. i find jung ryeo won cute, they look good together, their chemistry is 'wow!'. this k drama is one of the best."
2,I'm Still Confused,Why? The leading character Bok-Shil was a person in her twenties but acted more like she was 12 or maybe perhaps 15. She didn't act naive she acted like she was somewhat touched.Her birth mother and her adopted mother had no say and both act dimwitted like her it was somewhat contagious. For someone in her twenties to be still sporting pippi longstocking braids I wanted to unbraid her hair and give her some commonsense. Did she ever go to school and get her high school diploma and what exactly did she do for a living? These are lasting questions in my mind and what exactly type of an engagement party did they decide upon ?If you ever find the answers to these question please tell me......
5,Heaven,"Charm and vitality that are the mark of Lubitsch films are all in this collection.So much more enjoyable than much of what passes for entertainment today. What can you sayabout a filmmaker who described dancing as "" an epidemic of foxtrot"". So charming!"
1,A lot of jargon from a professional careerist,"Beware of the doctor/writer who discusses mental illness in terms of semiology and dialectic. She is looking to further her career with this book, establishing herself as a so-called expert and believe me, Michel Foucault she is not. If you are looking for something pratical, useful or the least bit helpful, look elsewhere. Buyer/petient/parent beware! I gave it one star because zero wasn't an option but if it were...negative numbers anyone?"
5,A great book,"It provides a complete history of Hong Kong since the 19th century in just one volume. Very impartial on difficult issues. It provides a lot of information and very good analysis. I would like to find something more about the economics of Hong Kong and some tables or graphs but statistical data, but I understand quite well that the content of the chapters fulfills completely the expectations of the title."
4,PS3 Frag FX,"I am glad that I purchased this product and would recommend it to anyone interested in mouse functionality for games that don't support regular mice.PROS:~Goes well with the Black PS3 theme.~Comes with its own mouse pad, but you don't have to use it.~Very light.~Extremely customizable features (read other reviews or manual).CONS:~The left analoge stick doesn't feel quite right (but works well).~Some of the button locations could have been shifted slightly for comfort and ease of access.~Not the easiest mouse to grip (but is light enough that this is not really an issue).WORST PART:It is not wireless and cannot be set aside without having a mess of cables.I would only STRONGLY recomend this to someone that really wants mouse functionality from their games where a mouse they have doesn't work. This mouse has worked on every single game I have.If it were wireless, I would recomend it to EVERYONE and would purchase a seond one for myself."
2,frag fx controller,"The left side of the controller is great, The only things i don't like revolve around the mouse,1st the side buttons on the mouse i.e. x,o are a little too low, hitting the square button your thumb hits the mat a lot.That and the buttons are not very sensitive to the touch.You have to push them all the way down, they don't work with a tap at all.Same go's for the right and left click buttons.They have no sensitivity at all, they too have to be pushed all the way down, unlike a pc mouse that clicks easy.In my opinion it works fine unless you want to play hardcore online games.If so id try the frag fx v.2 it might be better i will try it soon myself.But for this one id would stick it out and just use the reg ps3 controller."
3,Great if it works....,"My frag fx was broken out-of-box, according to splitfish they will send a replacement...it's been a month today and still don't have it (They warned about that though, so...) My friend bought it same time I did and his was fine, I played with it little bit and it's great, I started enjoying FPP games on viedo consoles. Bottom line: It's great if you're lucky enough to get a working item or if it doesn;t break in a first month. Looks like your chance to get good one is 50% ;)"
1,Broke after 50 hours of gameplay....its junk,"I received the controller yesterday and cracked it open immediately. I played with it for approximately 2 hours and it was setup perfectly. I didnt have to adjust one thing except for senstivity of the mouse. This works very similarly to playing on PC. I agree with other reviewers in that its at about 90% of what PC gaming is like. This is good enough for me. The only complaint I have about it is the cord. Its only about 10 feet long, which is okay for a bedroom gamer, but for my large living room, this severly limits where i can sit. This is minor overall, and this controller is awsome. If your a PC gamer that wants to play FPS games on you PS3, BUY THIS NOW! You wont regret it.**UPDATE**Broke after 50 hours of gameplay. A piece of junk."
1,Pending,"I'm having the same issues as D. Chen. The range of movement for this mouse is absurd.EDIT: I have called splitfish, and they said that they'll send a new one to me right away - the one I have is either defective or it has a firmware issue (?)I will edit this review when I receive the replacement."
2,Blegh...,"I did not like this product as many other reviewers have stated. I probably could have spent more time getting used to it, but it did not play like a normal mouse and keyboard in any way. I had absolutely no precision with this and could not even make minor adjustments to aiming (i.e. guy is just outside your cross hairs and you need to move the aimer slightly).Moving the mouse seemed very inconsistent with how much your aiming would change - sometimes a two inch move would turn the character 90 degrees and sometimes it would turn the character 60 degrees. I tried playing with the in-game sensitivities as well as the sensitivity wheel on the mouse, and could not find any rhyme or reason to why this would be.If anyone has success with this product, please let the rest of us know your secret."
1,Junk don't work - no support,Got it and it doesn't work. Won't update firmware. Tried emailing and calling Splitfish. No answer. Money wasted.
1,Far Far from a PC,"I'm a PC gamer for like.. forever...I had the impresion this FragFX was going to be like when I play in my PC, but no is far from it; I don't know if is the control or the console, but is way more easy to play with the standard control that with this control."
1,Useless,"Plugged it in and nothing worked. Dead as a dodo. Neat idea, but utterly worthlees execution."
5,Works great,"I was hesitant to buy this after reading some bad reviews, but this thing isdefinitely better than using a controller for FPS games on my ps3. It's notbetter than using a real keyboard and mouse of course, i'm one of those people who couldnt' get used to using a controller for FPS games (i really tried, i played it for 2 weeks straight)PS, i'm using this controller for call of duty 4, and it works like a dream"
2,broken mouse on arrival,"The frag fx controller showed up with a broken mouse. The mouse buttons worked but the mouse did not track movement. The red LED light at the bottom was on when 1st plugged in to the PS3. But after I realized it did not work, I looked and saw that it was no longer on. The nunchuck side felt good in your hand, the mouse felt light weight and kinda cheap. Seems like it would be cool, but I never got to fully experience game play with it."
5,Don't know how I consoled without it!!!,"I've been into FPS's since the beginning...I have never been a fan of FPS's on consoles because I hate the sticks. My friends got me into CoD4 on my PS3 and I ended up coming across this controller.My first experience with it was similar to those reviews where people are saying the mouse responsiveness seems slow or even laggy, just a tad behind your actual movements. Plugging it in out of the box I experienced this as well. I was getting worried and disappointed because my kill/death ratio was much better on the Sixaxis PS3 controller.I jumped on Splitfish's website and I updated my FragFX's Firmware...that did the trick. CoD4 now feels like I am in CPL again on CounterStrike!!!I highly recommend this controller!! Thanks Splitfish!!"
4,Great controller,"This is great alternative for those of us who are either a PC gamer or aren't as fast with the reflexes as we used to be. I have improved control for fast moving FPS games and this allows me to enjoy the games more. If you read the instructions, and set up the controller, it works great. My only complaint is it is NOT wireless. Rumble would be nice, but I am not sure how they could incorporate that function.If you dislike the PS3 controller, or really prefer the mouse, this is a great option."
2,Doesn't work,This is waste. Doesn't even work with any other game but COD4 and Hardware is very cheap made.
4,Why so negative?,"First, I am a 10 year PC FPS gamer so something like this is needed for me to enjoy them on consoles. I received my FragFX today and so far I really enjoy it. It works fine and is not a cheap piece of crap as many of these reviews will lead you to believe. I upgraded my firmware with no problems and have customized it to run with a few games so far. It can be a little tricky to customize on some games (such as Quake Wars), but a little tweaking and your done. I recommend it to PC FPS players. It's at least worth a try to see if you like it better than the controller."
2,"Looking for ""mouse like movement""? Keep looking...","I have read other reviews and seen the video of a coustomer saying there is nothing wrong with this mouse and my final review it that this is a D item on a report card. Slugish movement that does not offer much of a advantage over a regular controler in a first person shooter. I play Team Fortress 2 and while it helps a lot, it is impossible to have the movement of a PC mouse. I have tried tweeking the sensitivity every wich combination between the game setting and mouse setting and there is no great setting to help the movement. overall it helps but not to the level to allow one to play to there full potential..."
2,Lower your expectations,"This product is ok, but I honestly found it much easier to use the controller. I am a big PC gamer, so I went in expecting a comparable experience and I as sorely disappointed. Small movements are impossible no matter how you configure it, and it is not possible to whip around and do a 180; you can only go as fast as the sensitivity in the game allows."
1,Garbage,"I bought this controller shortly after I got my PS3 because I love FPS and being that im mainly a PC gamer I thought this would give me an edge over everyone else online. It worked ok the first day, then I read online that there was a firmware update that improved the controllers performance. I downloaded the update and began to update and there was an error...now..my controller does not work. I was not able to restore it with software and my PS3 does not recognize it. I emailed the manufacturer twice and never received a response."
1,Someday.........,"I too had high hopes and it seemed to work as expected, but I soon was very disappointed. For some reason it began to lock up and just sit and whine like a siren. I checked the mfg web site and even updated my firmware, that wss not the problem. I called and emailed Tech Support. At first they were concerned but that didn't last long. After a number of emails and one ""test"" they wanted me to do, they promised to replace the ""defective"" unit. But, they said it would take a few weeks. It's been a few weeks and not only is my controller not working it's not replaced. Good idea, and maybe someday someone will get this part right."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS MEDIOCRE DEVICE!!!,"This product sucks. Please stay away from this. QUALITY IS MEDIOCRE. When i got my fragfx, the RMB stopped working after a few minutes. Tried updating the firmware and adjusting using the utility they have but no go. PLEASE STAY AWAY from this product!!!"
2,Great Idea...,"I was so excited to purchase this item as a gift, but when the gift receiver tried to use it the mouse was not the best it lagged at times and also was kind of squirrelly. He loved the idea of it and I would definitely try it again if I knew the mouse was improved."
2,IT OK if u are us to playin on the pc,the mouse was horible.... the movment was fine but the buttons have to be jammed to to work
1,Beware of defective mice on this controller,I ended up returning my Frag FX the left mouse button needed to be pressed very hard to fire a weapon. When playing a 1st person shooter this is unacceptable in offline play and very much so online. My friend has this controller and his works fine so I was able to tell mine was defective when it came to the mouse. Seeing how some others here have posted the same problem and reading forum posts this is a known issue and you are 50/50 when ordering this item to getting one that will have a good mouse.
1,Great for FPS; but all 3 I bought died within a month!,"The design and operation of the FragFX is nice. I was able to get through ""Resistance"" and ""Call of Duty 3"" and ""The Darkness"" quite smoothly. However, I purchased 3 FragFX's and all 3 quit working within a month. I have given up on the FragFx because of poor reliability.Please, will some other manufacturer other than Splitfish come up with a similar controller."
2,"mmmhh, i dont like it","The left and right buttons are pressure sensitive, then u must apply more force than u use in the desktop."
3,Splitfish vs. PS3 controller,"I bought a splitfish because a mouse is better than an analog stick for fast and accurate aiming in first person shooters. I got through the learning curve and eventually did see improvement in my COD4 kill to death ratios. However there are drawbacks. I found I was less agile and this meant frequently coming out on the losing end of encounters with the enemy in enclosed spaces. I couldn't turn around quickly and the tight grouping of buttons around my right thumb frequently resulted in an unplanned switching to my secondary weapon in the middle of a firefight. This often resulted in my death. In short, the advantages of the splitfish (better aiming and tracking with your sight) are counterbalanced by the drawbacks (less agility, inadvertent switching to the secondary weapon) not to mention the need for a lap desk (I play on a couch and the included mousepad is way too small). I'm back using the PS3 controller, and slowly getting better with it."
4,Gotta Like the idea first,Good product-- easy to use-- I like it! That being said everyone i know who has tried it hated it... It does take some getting used to to run it but if you grew up with FPS on the pc this is the way to go.
3,An Actual Balanced Account,"This is neither an expose nor a ballyhoo (despite the subtitle, ""Talent On Loan From God"", which is a phrase Limbaugh often applies to himself) but is straightforward account of an intelligent but aimless man who eventually wanders into the role of the biggest thing in talk radio.If it has a fault it's that it's too dry, but you'll find a lot of interesting events that foreshadow his future career as the right's spokesman. For instance, how he was fired from his DJ job for contantly playing the Rolling Stones'""Under My Thumb"", probably the most misogynistic rock song of all time."
5,Whether you love him or hate him...,"This is an interesting biography of Limbaugh, and the story of how he rose to the ""biggest"" talk show host in America, making history and breaking all kinds of records.Love him or hate him, this is an interesting story. And it's undeniable that Limbaugh has made a huge impact on radio, journalism, and his talk format is now being mimicked by Fox News, CNN, and even the liberals on MSNBC.If you listen to Limbaugh, you probably already know a few of these stories - things Limbaugh talks about openly, like his birth place of Cape Girardo, his early broadcast jobs in Kansas City and Sacramento. But this goes into much more detail, including some jobs where he *bombed* and/or got fired!!An interesting read."
1,Limbaugh gave a voice to idiots and continues to do so . . .,"He gave voice to the tea party. He helped GW destroy this country. Everything that is wrong with America right now, the depression, etc., is due to him and his like. Ignorant, frightened, fearful people. Did you hear Sarah's daughter is marrying the man she maligned? How sad are those of you who would even listen to this complete idiot? You've made him rich. You've destroyed this country and now you're joining the tea party to completely demolish it. I hope reason, and sanity prevail, but I'm not really certain myself. November will show us how strong the self-destructive impulse in this country is. This guy's a moron. I don't care about his ""life story"". Personally, mine's more interesting. Get a life of your own and a brain of your own and think your own thoughts. This guy is a poster child for what's wrong with America. What a country. Idiot's can actually take over a political party and rule. How sad."
3,Good but not the first internal med book I would buy,"This book is great but sometimes it's too much especially if you are just starting out. The online aspect is okay, not that searchable and certainly not readable from an online perspective (can't scroll page by page.)"
2,adequate,The Minolta we previously had produced better pictures without having to worry about settings. I can't get as good pictures with this Pentax--just very average ones. I won't buy this brand of camera again.
2,Disappointment With This Little Camera,"Initially, I was pleased with the size of the camera and the quality of the outdoor photos. However, after looking at the prints from several of my kids school concerts, I was very disappointed in the camera. While using 400 speed film, and a full zoom lens, the photos came out very dark. The pictures were taken in a school gym during daylight hours with plenty of light. I never had any problems like this with my old, 80mm Fuji camera. I would not buy another Pentax camera."
2,I have owned my Pentax for 8 months and......,I like the camera but the automatic lense cover stopped working. I owned a Pentax about 10 years ago and it broke too after about a year. I don't think I will buy another Pentax
3,"Well, my 8 year old son actually watches it and seems to be interested","This content is just great for my 8 year old son. Not too much information but just enough to try to make it interesting to learn all of the state capitals. However, I would not call this a video. There is no streamed film. Wa! But that must be why it is so inexpensive. There are only 2 screens for each state -one with a simple map (simple is good for learning) and one DOS terminal screen shot of information. I am not kidding! The most amazing thing is that my son watches it contently all of the way through. Good for me at that price!"
5,#%$**((#%^^#@*,"I, for the life of me will never understand these movie companies! They keep turning out a lot of crappy old films to DVD and then you get a really good picture like this one (in which I often think about) and they delay putting this to DVD! Someone is sleeping upstairs! I can name quite a few movies they should have ""hurried up "" and convert to DVD. Lisa is definitely one of them!!!!"
3,A thriller for youngsters?,"Lisa is a teenage girl who cannot date, because her mother thinks she is too young. Richard is a serial killer who calls his victims and leaves a message on their answering machine before he kills them. One day their paths cross...The story flows quite naturally as does the dialogue. And the acting is good all over. Still, it never really gets engaging (nor scary). Probably more suiting for a younger (early teens) audience. Not bad, but I don't think I will remember it for very long.In Sweden this film is called ""The Candlelight Killer""."
4,I wish they would release this on DVD,"I remember this movie airing on tv all the time when I was younger. I use to love watching it and became reminiscent one day and started looking for it on Amazon.com. I found it, but VHS used version It works fine and I am glad I got it; however, the trick will be to keep having some type of contraption that plays vhs tapes. Although I guess eventually DVD players will be obsolete. Blue ray is alreay taking over the video section!"
3,Seasoned Review,I have been following Tunnel Trance Force since 1998. This CD isn't the best CD to choose. Get one of the regular series to CD sets.
4,"great product, but double check your application","I am new to reloading and when I started buying my setup I heard nothing but great things about the lee dies. I wanted to use these because with the carbide construction you don't need to use case lube. With all that I did have to return these. The reason is that I bought a Hornady LNL AP press, and what I didn't know is that the lee dies are a bit short to be used with this press. I have found videos that say yes they work, but I set it up and the dies were hanging on by a thread so I didn't feel comfortable sticking with them. I returned them and the return was smooth and fast as any returns I've had with Amazon. I went with the Hornady dies and of course they worked just fine. So as long as you know the lee dies work with your press I would recommend them to anyone, buy with confidence."
5,Always Dependable,Lee Dies are imo the best on the market. Lee has maintained the simplest and lowest cost reloading equipment for many years.
5,only the best,better then i could have ever imagined i thought i knew Hank but i didnt know didiley till i got this set some old tracks like 2 out of the whole set a bit scracthy but good lord they are over 50 years old what do you expect there are some tracks on here where Hank is speaking to a radio audience they are worth the price themselves plus its a good way to drive the family crazy on long drives. The included books and pictures are also worth the price of admission if you are a fan like me you have got to own this
2,Corrections!,"Just wanted to point out a couple of things real quick regarding the last review.I didn't miss ""Crazy Heart"" or ""Are You Building A Temple In Heaven"" on my review! Also, the ""live"" recordings he's mentioning are from the ""On Stage-Live"" LP's, and the aforementioned songs by Mr. Russell were the studio recordings with applause tacked on to them!""Lonely Tombs"", ""Blue Eyes"", etc. are from the Mother's Best radio show which Mercury is holding out on until September of next year more than likely!Great review, but for reference, there were 44 overdubs! Please e-mail me for list!"
4,Comfy for BCBG boots,"I've been looking for boots all winter, and I finally came across these. I don't usually buy shoes online, but I figured I could always return them. Not suede, as I initially thought (guess I didn't read the description carefully enough) but very soft stretchy material. Comfy to wear (I take an 8 1/2 in boots and ordered an 8 1/2) and I run around at work all day. I'll be interested to see how long they hold up. The only issue I had with them was that I had to keep pulling them up throughout the day.Update: Sadly, the rubber sole has begun peeling at the toe, forcing me to take a pair of scissors to the boots to cut off little pieces. Still love the boots, although I wouldn't recommend them for daily use."
2,Away from this book is where the reader should stay,"I could not read further than page 60; this one book had nothing in the way of the author's The Most Southern Place on Earth, a very entertaining, well told, and informative book indeed. This one is pure scholarly babble. I couldn't find two consecutive intelligible lines. It's full of this scholar said, and that intellectual said. No history, social or otherwise, just pedants' babble.A bore and a terrible frustration after the high expectations I had grown."
5,Decent daily watch!,"It looks great and works well...it was shipped ontime, condition was perfecr. Overall, it's an inexpensive daily watch...go for it!"
2,Challenging...and I don't get it,"I picked this up on the strength of Poppy's work on ZTT and his more recent collaboration with Claudia Brucken.This is a one track album. This in and of itself is not a problem. The problem is that I cannot differentiate any section from any other section. It doesn't appear to build to anything and in point of fact doesn't really seem to change at all.The instrumentation is electronic and features about four different ""voices"". It starts off decently enough by creating a moody, almost spooky, atmosphere. I want to like it, but I grow weary of it long before its 35 minutes are up.I'm not a huge fan of minimalism and I prefer his more expansive pieces like ""The Object is a Hungry Wolf"" so maybe that plays into my inability to appreciate this piece.Interesting side note. A friend point out that this first letters of the album title spell TARDIS. I don't know if Poppy is a Dr. Who fan, but it was enough for me to bump the rating a star."
2,Ghosts.,"Including drivers that are recently deceased is really tacky. As mentioned by other reviewers the graphical quality deteriorates when you use the rear view mirror or have a lot of cars on the screen. The cars do seem to have a lot of push which was also mentioned by another reviewer. I found the Superspeedways to be generally boring. The Short Tracks on the other hand are actually fun which saved it from being one star. You can use the brake and accelerator in the corner to set the car up. Also try using a driver that is known as a short track racer, they seem to go faster! ...."
1,Major Disappointment,"I had reasonably high hopes for this one, and read the reviews expecting some studdering/pixelized graphics before buying, but thought the ""fast paced"" gameplay would make up for it.I was wrong. I was bored with this game after a couple of hours. The graphics are mediocre at best and the gameplay is SO boring.You better rent this one first before blowing 50 bucks."
2,Is this a PS2 game?,"Nascar 2001 has the feel of a game that was rushed to market. While all the big names and popular tracks are there, the game exhibits some inexcusable graphical flaws that distract from what could have been a superior game. The car and track models look top notch, that is until there's a lot happening on the screen and the resolution starts dropping. Edges get jaggy and the textures get blurry. In 2-player mode the resolution drops so much at times it seems like you're playing a PSOne game. Die hard NASCAR fans might be able to excuse these flaws for all the features and customizable options the game offers, but the rest of us would be better off going elsewhere for racing action"
1,The original on PS1- is better!,"I loved the first game on ps1- cool graphics, music, gameplay... on ps2- its ok graphics (not what it should), bad music, and horrible gameplay- if you like understear... and plowing through turns... buy a lawnmower instead of this game. If EA puts out anymore trash like this- they will ruin their awesome reputation. My copy is for sale... and I couldnt even give it away to my friends..."
2,Just a waste of time and money,"This is the worst racing game I have ever played.1. The season is very long and you can't improve your car as you go through.2. Every track is pretty much the same. Sure, one is a little longer than the other, or it's oval is a little sharper, but there really isn't much of a difference.3. The graphics are horrendous; it looks like this game could work on a regular playstation.4. All the cars are the same, except for little differences in looks. There are only 3 different car types: loose (great speed, no handling), Neutral (average speed and handling), and tight (no speed and great handling). These do not change from car to car.The only good thing about the game is the drafting system: you actually use your opponents draft to gain speed and pass them.Do not buy this game. It is a complete waste of both time and money"
2,What was EA thinking???,"I just bought this game. I'd seen the demo for it, and thought it would be great especially after owning SSX and Maden 2001, which was also released by EA. The game is fun, but the graphics are so substandard for the Playstation 2, that I'd have to say they can't be much better than the PS1's graphics. Shame on you EA. If you looking for a good racing game, and graphics are you kick, don't get this game."
1,This game really lacks,"I have all the the Nascar games that has came out, but this new 2001 PS2 version is the worst yet of all. The graphic are good, but that is standard with the PS2 console. So that don't count. The reduction of tracks in the 2001 version is the biggest down fall of this game. No interactive pit stops. The Nascar 2001 PS1 version is a better game than the PS2, and I play that one on the PS2."
1,NASCAR PS2 fails to qualify!,"I was thoroughly let down! Only 3 default car setups, car handels [poorly] and yellow flags take way way too long. Sometimes 5 laps in a 10 lap race. Previous nascar games on Ps1 were way better. Car models are nice, but that is it. You'll want your money back if you rent it!"
2,"Same of this, less of that!","I found that this is the same game as for the PS1, with a little better graphics than the first. They have also reduced the amount of control you have when setting up the car as well during pit-stops. Over all this game is not worth the disc it is burned on! My opinion, worse that a flat tire going into turn 1 at 200 miles per hour!!"
5,Daytona hasn't looked any better,"One sentence describes this game: if you are a fan of racing games, Nascar, or just like games period, this game makes an excelent addition to your game library!"
3,"Great fun, but problems abound","No doubt about it, NASCAR 2001 is a fun game to play. However, this game shows signs of being rushed out the door. The most noteable problem comes in the graphics department: graphics break up (get chunky) when racing in two player mode or on the more complicated courses like Sears Point.I would wait for NASCAR 2002 (or whatever it will be called) to give EA a chance to tune its graphic engine for the PS2."
2,"Just OK - From a true race fan who owns Nascar98, 99, & 2000","The addition of Daytona was the compelling reason for me to purchase this. When I first took a practice lap around the track, it was amazing. The graphics looked great. However, once you start racing with other cars, the graphics seem to slow down, and go down in resolution.Seems like this one was rushed out. Lot's of features from previous versions are missing... ie. fine adjustment of your race car, custom instant replay with controls and camera angles, etc.A total of 12 tracks are included. An ad that I got in another EA flyer seemed to suggest that Homestead was a track included, but it was not.You might want to rent this one first before purchasing it."
4,Good DVD player for bedroom use,"I was pleasently surprised with this DVD player. It was affordable, easy too hook up and easy to adjust the settings. I have it hooked up with component cables to a 15 inch lcd hdtv and the picture looks great in 480P. The only problem I had was with the DVD of Ladyhawk, instead of going straight to the DVD menu, it plays the movie automatically. I can't even go to the menu afterward....weird... But all other dvd's I tried work great. I also use it as a regular CD player, but I wish it had some sort of screen saver that would turn on during long plays (but since I use a lcd tv, I'm not really worried). Overall a good buy for a secondary room, like a bedroom or study."
2,Magnavox DVD Player Review,"I expected better from a basic DVD player and other reviews led me to believe this would be better. We have a large selection of older DVD's and from day one, the player would have problems of freezing up. It seems the slightest smudge on the DVD would cause a problem. The remote was also incredibly cheap and basic with terribly poor button layout. After three days of frustration, I returned it for a refund. Avoid this unit if you can!"
1,No PRoduct Support,"This model, despite the Magnavox label is NOT a Magnavox product and has no support from there. It is actually Funai, and they no longer support this model. You cannot play HDMI DVDs and there is no firmware upgrade. If you want an obsolete model with no service support then go ahead and buy it. If you want something that will work tomorrow then pass or you're just going to be out $50"
1,The other reviews are not for this dvd player,"This player does not play Dixv files like the other reviews suggest, I had to return mine. The other reviews are for a different dvd player."
2,Cheap Quality,"I returned this product shortly after purchasing at Walmart. It dvd tray was made of cheap plastic and hung out very loosely. I do not think the product is meant to last more a year at best if used often and gingerly. It plays divx files on cds very well, but had problems with divx files on dvds. It is"
4,Easy to use. Good value,Easy to set up. Easy to use. Great picture quality. The remote could be a little bigger. Woul also be nice if it could control the TV. Otherwise great little machine.
2,"Good Writing, Failed Scholarship","This book appears to attempt capitalize on recent interest in SS-Gruppenfueher (General) Heinrich Mueller's career, particularly noted in the series of books by Gregory Douglas based on primary sources available since the early 1990s (to Douglas, at least). This book reads well, but is not referenced in a manner that will be useful to readers who prefer documentation (and yes, there are publishers who allow it!). For the general reader, who isn't interested in such distinctions, it may be a good read, but absent any analysis of Mueller, his career, or recent findings, the book fails to hit its intended mark."
1,Don't Waste your money,"Prior to reading this book, I had read the excellent three volume set ""Gestapo Chief"" by Gregory Douglas. I bought this book, hoping to get additional information on Heinrich Muller. Unfortunately, this book was apparently written to discredit Douglas' 3 books. The book's cover is even identical to Volume 1 of Gregory Douglas' books. This book is essentially a rehash of previous books on the SS and Gestapo, ... and much unsupported conjecture about the career and subsequent disappearence of Muller. ... If you want to know the truth about Heinrich Muller, read Gregory Douglas' 3 books. Together, they are the standard work on the Gestapo Chief against which all other books on the subject must be judged."
2,"Not worth your time, but the only book on the subject.","This is a rambling account of Mueller's career, poorly supported by the limited research performed by this author. Although it is mildly interesting or entertaining as a""spy"" story (which Mueller wasn't), it certain is not an authoritative or accurate account of the subject. It presents theories for what happened to Mueller, but no real answers."
2,What happened to Heinrich Muller.,"I enjoyed two of Whiting's previous books, but this one was hard to follow. One of the previous reviewers stated this work was rambling. I have to agree. The flow in this book from chapter to chapter was terrible. The author would review one section about the Red Orchestra, then in the next chapter review some aspect of Roehm, Boring, Nebe's life. One had a hard time with what the author was trying to prove. Intermingled in this writing was slugs of information about Gestapo Muller. It almost appeared that the author had a hard time finding enough material about Muller, so anything related to him was thrown into the book.This could have been a good book if the author had focused on the subject. Rather he threw everything in, including the kitchen sink. I did learn something about Gestapo Muller, so that is why I rated this two stars. Otherwise this was a poor read."
4,If you liked The Matrix,"If you liked The Matrix, I highly recommend this book. Very original premise, with a wonderful cast of characters and situations. Fast read, and will keep you thinking long after you put it down."
4,Neil Young & Crazy Horse - Rust Never Sleeps - The Concert Film,"If you like Neil Young, you will like this one. picture: 4 stars, sound: 4 stars."
3,pretty wack,"I just watched this last night- the Road Eyes are pretty weird if you ask me. But then they originated in RI, so it's no surprise how wack they are. Neil Young and band give a great performance, broken up from time to time with the Road Eyes moving about the stage and placing about oversized cartoonish versions of amps and mics. And the Woodstock stage announcements and Hendrix national anthem? Why is Neil trying to re-live that festival from 9 years previous? The wireless acoustic and miked harmonica were probably revolutionary for 1978 live sound, and the acoustic portion sounds great, as does the audio on Crazy Horse and the rest of the show."
2,current Neil is better,"Dated, slow and corny. If you want to see a much better and dynamic concert...get the Year of the Horse concert...excellent. Neil is better with age in all ways!"
3,"Great Music, Poor Concert Concept","Personally when I listen, or as in this case, watch and listen toa live concert, I appreciate the uninterrupted flow of the concert.This concert was the antithesis of that concept. I mean if youridea of a fun theater concept DVD is watching little people in monkcostumes shuffle about between songs trying to create a Gulliver'sTravels ambience with fake props, have at it. Personally, whetherit is a cd or DVD I prefer one song flowing into the next. At leastwhen Bruce Springsteen decides to ""chat"", there is music in thebackground. Neil does no chatting, though I would have preferredit to the unamusing stage show (give me Spinal Tap's Stonehengeover this any day) offered here. I'm afraid I've been spoiled bylistening to ""Full House"" by the J. Geils Band one too many times."
5,Neil Young @ his BEST,"The video is fair with this old remaster of a classic concert, but the audio is great and that's all that really counts!I first listened to this album in 1985. But haven't heardit it in years. I recently bought the DVD version and boy doe's it bring back memmories. This remastered DTS version is killer on my Klipsch surround. The remastered DTS 5.1 is refreshing.Neil Young plays acoustic and electric which gives any listerner a wide range of Neil's music. From Sugar Mountain to Kortez this is a must for anyone who wants classic Neil Young at his BEST!!"
5,A Treasure!!,"From accoustic to electric, 1978 Neil Young all the way.With Dolby Digital 5.0 plus 2.0 AND DTS, this is and aways will be an amazing concert experience. ""Like a Hurricane"" can only be experienced by standing up.....wow---a rare treat done so well on DVD.....I missed my dinner by 2 hours planning to watch just a couple songs---beginning to end this is sheer pleasure."
2,So-so,"Good to have this DVD in my collection but, the video/audio is not of good quality, nor is the plotline"
2,Don't Buy It,"The silly antics of the dancing Roadeyes, who are over this DVD, detract greatly from this concert's impact. Neil singing the first two songs from on top of the huge speaker also detracts. Frankly it's all ""sophomoric"" and not worthy of a great performer. The contrasty stage lighting and the almost complete lack of any crowd shots also detracts. For me, an excellent concert was ruined by all this stuff. I do not agree with the other reviews on this site (except for the two who also said the stage antics were silly). A lot of reviews say if you are a fan, you will love this. That is NOT the standard. If you are a fan, you'll love anything by a group. The standard is if you merely have an interest, you'll love it. There are many excellent concert DVDs (and VHS tapes) out there. Check out some of the ""favorites lists"" by other Amazon contributors (posted on amazon.com) for ideas and buy something else."
4,Neil in one of his best phases,"My previous memories of this movie were based on a poor-quality VHS rental. This DVD is a big step forward from that experience, particularly the sound quality. It's nice to have the DTS option in addition to DD 5.1. The picture quality and direction is amateurish, but also pure Neil. I would have given the movie 5 stars had it better sound quality and substantially better video quality. The quality of the music itself, however, is simply matchless."
5,The best. Can't say more than that.,"This is my favorite concert video. It makes you want to take the Tupperware out and get the wooden spoons and play 'em. I broke many bowls and spoons. This is the video that gave me ambition to buy an old set of Ludwig Rockers (drum kit) and ""blow the carbon out"". Neil an 'Horse at its best.My best recommendation. Excellent (need I say more?) music.Must be played loud, standing up or with percussion :-)"
4,I was there!,"This video is amazing to watch, how the whole storm came together - I had the experience of being on a Holland America cruise that was trying to enter the Tampa port - but a half hour away, they closed the port because it would have been too dangerous to come under the bridge - they sent us out to sea where our ship was tossed around like a toy boat for two days - every piece of glass or china was smashed. It was amazingly dramatic to be caught in as the bow & stern of the ship would alternate being swamped by waves and then the ship would role side to side. This video brought it all back and more!"
4,"I was there, too!","I was in Birmingham, Alabama, and spring was blooming everywhere one day and the next, we had 16"" of snow in my parking lot and no power. This was my first blizzard and would prefer it be my last. The blizzard did more tree damage than Hurricane Opal, which came straight through Alabama. Really a remarkable storm."
3,School resource,The Information is a great help I am using it for my son's homeschooling. there is one problem- the kindle does not have page numbers which makes it hard to find the page I need my son to read.
3,Overkill,"The book is well organized, highly researched, and well written, but very boring! It simply analyzes biblical literature to death and makes many of the not so interesting and not so well written parts of the Bible out to be much more than they really are. It's a bit like trying to make the phone book out to be a great piece of literature. It isn't. It is a good source of information and that's all. The Bible has some nice literary parts to it to be sure, but the author stretches the value of much of the literature in the Bible. Her focus on the mundane, was tedious, and left much to be desired. I would have much rather had her be less detailed and cover the more interesting and valid aspects of Biblical literature rather than trying to make even Geneologies and redundant historical accounts out to be more interesting than they really are. Frankly, many of the stories in the Bible are really not that well written and to try and make it seem as though they are is just delusion"
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I can't say that I really enjoyed this all that much. I picked it up because I had read two good reviews of it, but I feel differently. I have a lot of issues with this: one, I didn't feel anything for the characters - there wasn't much development at all; two, the plot was thin - a page-turner this is not; and three, the novel had a distinctive English feel to it (meaning it's a little boring). Maybe I would have felt differently if I had read some of the other 'Frank Elder' novels, but I haven't, and I don't. And except for the last 50 predictable pages, there's not much action here, either."
5,The master is back,"John Harvey wrote a famous series with Det. Charlie Resnick, who makes a cameo appearance in this book.After the series ended many a reader was sorely dissappointed.Luckily, he gave us Frank Elder, retired Det. Inspector, still fighting his demons. Mr. Harvey's poetic writing and deft hand with the construction of the plot is still present.His characters are alive and really flesh and blood as the title states. I am thrilled that there are two more books in the series, and I am hoping for more. This is the best of crime writing, as usual coming from the Brits."
5,Street Fighter EX3,"I recently bought this game because i enjoyed the past games for the other systems. When i put this game in i was surprised because the graphics were excellent and the gameplay was off the charts, i recommend this game to any tekken or virtua fighter lover this surpasses them all."
4,Get this Game at Sams Club!,This game is great but you can get it at sams club.com for almost half the price!
2,...,"i bought this game since i'm a fan of the street fighter series. and i was very disappointed, it's slow, the characters are too big for the screen (i expected something more like streetfighter ex2 plus), no replay value (in street fighter ex2 plus u could play vs with the cpu, u chose both characters which is not possible here). the grafx are good, but the game isnt. buy marvel vs capcom or something instead."
5,i am hungarian,"How can I unlock Evil Ryu?How can I earn Bronze medal in party, stage 2?Hogy tudnám feloldani Evil Ryu-t egyszerbben, medál nélkül?Mit kell csinálni a bronzért a 2. pályán partiban?"
1,nothing but garbage!,ex3 [is bad] the characters look like a bunch of big blocks put together. They also feel like they weigh a ton when i move with them. Street fighter needs to stay animated not 3D. Another reason why ex3 is garbage is because the game is on the ps2 and the ps2 is GARBAGE GC and xbox rule that's that.
2,too easy and way too short........,Being a die-hard street fighter fan i rented this game. BIG MISTAKE! I took it home and popped it into playstation2 and hoped for a great game instead i got 5 minutes of beating the game. This game was not as good as half of the other street fighter titles out there. this game is not worth 50 bucks!Graphics- 4 1/2 (out of 5)controlles-1replay- 2value- 1
3,It was made well but..,OK I've played basically ever Street Fighter game since Street Fighter 2 on SUper NES. This one of course has a lot better graphics and control but cmon its the same game as it was like 10 years ago ( so much the same that I beat the game with out using one continue my first time). This is a well made game but lets face it capcom you need to retire Street Fighter while your still ahead. Want a fighting game try Tekken Tag or DOA 2 they are much better and much more difficult to learn.
2,Way Too Easy...,"Plain and simple, the first time I played the game, I beat it. There is absolutely no challenge, and when you do finally beat the game (after 10 mins.) The endings ...! I dont recommend this game at all. SF2 for Super Nintendo was much better and more of a challenge. They've really dropped the ball on this one."
2,rent this do not buy it,"lets get to the point the game is fun but so were all the other sf2 games. The first time I put it in I beat it then tried it on the hard level and same thing again, won with out a loss...ok with another player but the computer is a joke."
2,Not As Good As It Could Be,"This game gives me mixed emotions. I am a huge fan of Street Fighter games, and I want to like it, but when playing it you just can't seem to connect to the 3D characters. They look cold and lifeless, like mannequins or dolls.The graphics are not very good and there is frequent slowdown. More than that, the artwork itself is not impressive. It is also very disorienting to play a fast moving fighting game in 3D, and this game in particular makes a friend of mine nauseated the camera angles are so awkward.One minor annoyance, when you beat the game you are set up into a little 'mini-game' and have to knock down as many people as you can. This can be fun but it ruined because of the horrible sound effects this game has.My final verdict is that this would be worth buying, but not at [this price]. Wait for the bargain bin, in the meantime enjoy Marvel vs Capcom 2 on Dreamcast, which is an infinitely better game."
2,Street Fighter Done Bad,"Street Fighter, always one of my favorite fighting games, and one of the few 2d fighters left, and that was ok because it was Street Fighter! But for some sick reason they decided to move it from lovingly done cartoonish 2d fighters to sub-tekken 3d. Why??? If you want a 3d fighter, get Tekken Tag. If you want 2d beauty like good-old Street Fighters of the past, sorry."
1,Hated it,"I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just never impressed with the Street Fighter series when it becomes a 3D game. The graphics look terrible. It looks like a 3 year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said, ""look Mommy, it's Blanca!""Really please, you can't tell me that you're impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game? Honestly, Street Fighter was a game that should have never gone 3D because it just doesn't work for the game because even so, you don't even have that because all you do is go back and forth. You can't get stuck in a corner but you also can't side step like Tekken.If PS2 really wanted to impress people, releasing Street Fighter Alpha 3 would have been the smarter move. I have to say, I'm really hoping that another one of these is not in the making."
2,This series is getting old,"All of the Street Fighter EX games (the ones in 3D) have been pretty bad. This one is no different. While it easily has the best graphics in the series, it should still look better for a 128-bit game. Capcom should have tweaked the controls, but it's obvious they rushed this one. Try Tekken Tag Tournament."
5,Great Street Fighter!,"Well, I personally like this game! I remember when Street Fighter EX+Alpha came to the PSX I loved it! Then I went to my movie theater and saw Street Fighter EX 2 I had to play it! Next it came to PSX with the Plus, And now SFEX3 is on PS2 with a better game engine then the Japanese Version.. If you're not a SF fan don't bother with this game, but If you're looking for a cool game fighter for the PS2 get this! If you have a Multi-Tap the cool 2 on 2 or 1 on 3 battles will keep you coming back for more! Over all this game is worth the money ."
2,SF EX3,"At First I thought this game was really good. The graphics are great. But after I mastered it and beat it so many times, I got sick of it. You'd be better off by getting Capcom Vs. SNK2. Im a big SF fan but this game isn't that good."
3,Not enough...,"I wasn't impressed by her playing. Sure her technique was great and she played all the notes, but that was IT! Her phrasing was not what i wanted to hear. She plays the concerti very ""choppy"". I wish her articulation was smoother and more romantic. One good thing about her playing was very polyphonic and she emphasized on the right notes. I think she still has a long way to stardom."
1,Poor design sink divider,"This sink divider has suction cups that are too small in size and consequently do not stay in place. The divider is also too small in all directions and barely covers 50% of the top of the sink divider. Also, the hinged area of the mat which is supposed to allow the sides of the mat to bend over the sink divider are too think, so unfortunately the sides want to keep popping up. Rubbermaid is known for ingenious and useful products, this is not one of them."
2,seems like a good idea,suction cups work poorly on this mat. the handle on the side is useless. could be a little longer too.
4,Not what I was expecting,I thought the CD would have been more like the Art of Concentration which is instrumental with no singing. This has singing about Peace. The songs are nice but too pretty for my taste but that's just me. Others might love it.
2,Gauntlet Boring After 5 minutes,"I rented Gauntlet over the weekend and i wasn't very impressed with the game. I was an avid player of Diablo 2 for the computer and I was hoping that Gauntlet would be as good, but it was just boring. The graphics were good, but that was about it. I just kept hitting the fire button while attacking the same monsters over and over again while navigating through a very limited board. This game might have been more fun If I was playing with the multitap, but for a single player game I definitely would not recommend it."
1,GAUNTLET...,"I hate this game!... I own the game, I bought it because I heard good reviews about it. When I started playing it I was 'STUPIFIED'! The game has SNES graphics combined with a very thin and simply put, stupied plot. Enemys simply walk up to you and you punch them, then they die. The game is easy and predictable! Please don't buy this game like I did. I only gave it 1 star because I heard the multi-player was really fun, but I'm sure it's exacly like the single player. Don't play it!!!"
4,Gauntlet: Dark Legacy Midway's Greatest Game,"While playing in both movie theaters and at home I discovered that it's fun to wipe out mummies, goblins, and so on. I recomend that you play yhis game only if you have huge amounts of patience or loads of codes like me. But it's also a good game even if you don't have any codes. This might help you, when entering your name enter INVULN and try it."
2,Could be fun,"While at first I was very excited about the possibility of multi-player gaming, it soon became apparent that the game was not challenging at all. I am not near becoming any real good on any games, as I am completely bad at all games except Jeopardy. However, if this game turns to be way too easy even for me, then I believe it will be extremely boring for most kids. Cute game to play with your spouse, and kill time once in a while. But half way through it, it just got very boring and we stopped playing altogether."
2,VERY BORING!!!,"I got this game yesterday, and it is the stupiedest game for the PS2 I've seen so far. With SNES graphics and a super thin storyline, this game presents no challenge whatsoever and the enemys you fight just run toward you until you punch them, then they die. Single game playing really sucks! I gave it 2 stars because I heard the multi-player was fun. Don't buy or rent this game! Wait for some good games to come out for the PS2, stick with regular PS games for now. I do reccommend 'Onimusha' because the only good game out so far for the PS2. Stick to my word, Gauntlet Is Boring!!! Save your money for something good, which I didn't do because I bought it. If you like multi-player games, then rent it. After a while it gives you a headache though, don't play to long!"
2,What fun and joy,"Simply put, this game is another version of Gauntlet Legends, a ""fun"" game where you run around and shoot monsters. This game, I noticed, is very much alike to that, so much that I knew what would come next in many levels, due to the fact that I had already played them. The only differences are the inability to turn off items, slightly improved graphics, different numbers, and different plot. I advise buying it only if you like mindless kill the enemy games that can be played while dictating your work."
5,Gauntlet: Dark Kegacy Rocks!,"Written by Ryan LeClairThis is an awesome game because it has the awsome characters, realms, and bosses! My favorite character is the knight. The minotaur is the best I have used so far. He has good speed, remarkable strength, sort of good defense, but bad magic! The blue knight is my favorite knight. Ithink the green Knight is pretty cool to. The yellow knight looks like an egyptian. But the red looks kind of ugly to me, because he looks like a viking with an extra-large beard and it also looks like the beard is so thick that it could knock out Lich until he was defeated! (I don't want to affend you so that is why I am saying no affense!)"
3,Not far from other Gauntlet implementations,"It is somewhat surprising how little difference there is between the various implementations. Visually the PS1 version isn't that much different from the PS2 version. Even the cutscenes aren't much better.There are more characters that one can control but the characters don't gain a significant amount of visual detail in the PS2 version. Part of the problem is that the characters remain about the same size in each version and there isn't a whole lof of detail one can fit in that same amount of screen space.If you don't have a version of Gauntlet for any platform then get the PS2 version (in this regard I give the game a 4/5). If you already have the PS1 version, get the PS2 one only if you are a die-hard gauntlet fan (in this case I would give the game a 3/5).Unless Midway ups the visual quality of the next version of Gauntlet significantly, they are going to lose their market to competitors like how they lost Mortal Kombat to the clones."
5,Reminiscent,I love this game. I need more people to play it with me. Not many of my friends are huge old game geeks... :/
5,Great game! NOT just killing things...,"I got this game on May 1st. The local store had it and I bought it. ITS GREAT! Everything from the music to the spells to the monsters to the characters is great, no complaints at all! There are like over 24 secret characters! They evolve by appearance, spells and power the more levels you go up! Tons of worlds/levels to conquer and the action is never dull. The graphics are great, especialy on spells and big monsters...and I haven't even tried the multiplayer mode! CANT WAIT! The levels are put together well and are very fun to explore and ... everything you see...hehe...falling rocks, lava oceans, burning walls, etc all make it more realistic. THE MUSIC IS GREAT!! Good catchy little songs, and erie noises make it really cool. Overall its a great game and I recomend it. Buy it, you wont be sorry!"
4,Gauntlet rules,"When I first started playing Gauntlet, I knew it was a winner. I played, and played, and played. As I explored, I found out just how big the whole game was. It had great graphics and never slowed down. The sound was awesome too. The only flaw I found was that it became repetitive. You had to do the same thing in every world you played in. Just kill the bad guys and get to the end. All and all, Gauntlet:Dark Legacy is a awesome game..."
4,Gauntlet,I very much enjoyed this game. I used to play on the GameCube but when I moved I gave the game and system to my grandchildren. So I bought the PS2 version after moving. I enjoy this game mainly because 4 people can play together which makes it something the family can play together. It isn't super difficult to beat the boss monsters so it is more enjoyable.I would recommend it.
4,"Long Game, moves well","Guantlet, Dark Legacy is colorful and character operation is easy. There is a lot of fighting in real time, with nasty monsters throughout the game. A wide variety of spells may be used by sorceress', executed with ease by assigned buttons. Slashing in the case of ... knights depending on your choice of characters. There area wide variety to choose from. I chose the yellow Sorceress. A dynamite character with tons of power and the Blue Knight the second time through (not so strong but cute)The graphics in this game were fantastic. Locations are huge and varied. The main bosses for each world are challenging but not impossible.If I were to improve this very nice game I would add some movement abilities for the characters. Maybe jumping and climbing."
4,Surprisingly...Good!,"I was beyond surprised that when I played this game, I was actually enjoying myself! The old style of hack and slash from the original arcade cult classic didn't seem to appeal to me quite much, but after what seemed like minutes into playing the game, I realized I've been at the game for hours with my now Level 34 Knight (Protector). If that wasn't addicting enough, multiplayer enhances gameplay by quite muchm increasing the fun factor amazingly. I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to feel a bit of that old style retro killing spree game and those seeking a great game to play amongst with friends!"
2,Major Disappointment,I owned the N64 Legends game. This was much better. The biggest complaint I have about this game is that unlike the N64 version you are unable to manage your inventory. Once you discover the super ability items you can't turn em off till they're used up. El Sucko. Do yourself a favor and avoid this pos.
2,howards garlic juice,"I have used this proguct for over 25 years. First time ever having a problem. When package arrived, outer box in good shape. Upon opening inner box, found several bottles had leaked out contents. Nothing broken. Caps maybe not be correctly installed. Lost 4 bottles out of 12."
2,Windowlicker...hummm...,"I enjoyed it the first time I watched it. After that it held my interest no longer. Borrow it just to hear the use of foul language.Not nearly as good as ""Come to Daddy"".And why is he obsessed with himself?"
3,mimesis,"the ""bixxare"" aspect of the work is attributable to the fixed smiles on james' face. this is not anything new. video artis t matthew barney employs the same device towards an ""ambient"" end which is similar (though this is not his total intent), but minus the aid of the music (whic h is necessary here because as a piece, windowlicker lacks substance.) the ""bizzare"" reality is established by presenting a contrasting everyday ""street"" reality in the opening sequence, with the limo sequence. aside from the white guy and the smiling masks (taken from Matthew Barney), this is a thinly veiled rap video of the type that's become conventional and cliche. great soundtrack, predictable videotrack"
5,Classic RDJ,"Awesome piece, just dont get too critical of the video...I think its classic and hilarious. Enjoy the music and savor the vid for what it is...delicious eyecandy"
5,Humanity peeks through war - True story,"When I saw this show on A&E;, it both deeply moved me and saddened me.It shows one of those spontaneous events that can never be factored into wartime statistics, because human beings are unpredictable ---- and most soldiers are barely men, with hopes, dreams and consciences. Then the bizarre reality of war snatches them back from a what some might call a miraculous occurence. A true story very relevant to any war."
4,fence stretcher,"This stretcher works great,the only thing im concerned with when stretching barbed wire,is the end you have anchored on the post youre stretching from,coming off thepost.I chained the end to the post so it wouldnt come loose.You have to knock the paint off of it so it will work.I put WD40 on the wire grips,they were stuck shut,you cant grip the wire unless these are free to pivot.All the other fence stretchers work the same,but are not manufactured as well,except for the paint!!I like this tool because it is a quality tool made in the good ol USA !!!!!!!!"
1,Incorrectly labelled product,"Description says it will fit a Pentax IQ Zoom 160, but check out the dimensions of a 160 - 5.0 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches. Now just try to fit that into this case that's only 2 inches thick!"
3,"Beware, Princess Elizabeth!!!","I would had give 3 and 1/2 stars if I could but not 4. Some readers had find the book ""Mary, Bloody Mary"" better then ""Beware, Princess Elizabeth"", I find ""Beware, Princess Elizabeth"" much better. It was not a book who keep you wanting to read more and more but it's not a bad book also, it good if you want to know the life of ""Elizabeth I"" when she was younger, it give you the main fact of her life."
4,SUSAN'S ONLINE REVIEW,King Henry the 8th dies leaving Edward the throne. Edward dies after 6 years of ruling. Edward leaves the throne to Jane Dudley (that's another story called 9 days a queen.) Jane knows that Mary is the rightful ruler of Englang but is forced to be queen. Most of England wanted mary as Queen so to prevent a rebellion they took the throne from Jane and gave it to Mary after nine days of rule. Mary had Jane and her husband beheaded. Elizabeth has many spies watching her every move to prevent he from causing an rebellion. Elizabeth is sent to the same tower as her mother was sent to many years ago and beheaded. will she have the same fate as her mother read the book and find out. i'm bad at writting so the book is way better than its sounds.
4,"4 1/2 Stars For Beware, Princess Elizabeth!","Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII, faces dangers and perils. Once her father dies, her brother becomes king. But sadly, he also quickly dies, moving the crown to her sister, Mary. Princess Elizabeth faces many hardships along her teenage life, in struggle to become Queen of England. Will she reach her goal of becoming queen?I think this is an amazing story, shown from the point of view of Princess Elizabeth. Carolyn Meyer seems to make this real story seem almost fictional with her wordplay. I thouroughly enjoyed this extremely suspensful and eduacational book. I highly reccomend this to people who like exciting history!"
4,decent story of queen elizabeth the first young life,this is another biograghy on queen elizabeth the first earlylife. it was pretty good but i think it would have been better ifthey had started it from the beginning of her life instead of atage 13 when her father died. queen elizabeth had one of the mostinteresting childhoods of any monarch i have read and the authordid not bother mentioning it at all. overall it does do justiceto her life up and until her ascention to the throne at age 25.personally if you like her life story i think mary kay does abetter job with the book legacy.
2,First Part was good,"This book was good in the begining and you were not sure quite what was going to happen next. But after the first 3rd of the book, you were fairly sure what was going to happen, making it very predictable. It also read like a history book which made it a boring book. I would not recament this book at all!"
5,"Elizabeth, Heroine","Imagine having a father who ordered your mother's death. Ordered the death of many innocent people. Rejecting you, his daughter. Fearing that he may kill you.Elizabeth Tudor is King Henry VII;s daughter. Before his death, she was nothing. When her brother, Edward, became king he was so young and frail that all of the corrupt and evil people walked all over him and controlled the country...and her. Edward dies, and Elizabeth's sister, Mary, becomes queen. Mary is now known as Bloody Mary. Mary murders those who don't support her fully, and those who aren't Catholic. Elizabeth is forced to go to miserable prisons, while those close to her are taken away. Elizabeth fears for her life.....and her succession to the throne."
5,Great Story,Perhaps one of the most fasincating queens of all time. Hardly anyone else goes through as much as Elizabeth did on her way to being queen andthat's why she'll always be my favorite. This book goes through the death of her father she goes to live with her stepmother and new husband when Elizabeth learns important lessons when she finds herself in a scandle with her stepmother's new husband. Things get worse for her when her brother dies and Mary becomes queen following the short reign of Jane and Elizabeth knows Mary wants her dead and is constantly on guard to keep that from happening but still finds herself in the Tower. Carolyn Meyer protrays Elizabeth's fears at that point when Elizabeth surely thought she was going to die. I recommend this book for everyone who's a fan of Elizabeth I's.
5,AWESOME,"I have re-read this book thousands of times. It is so awesome. Meyer is a great author, and I enjoy all of her books about the Young Royals.Elizabeth isn't your average fairy-tale princess. She is the forgotten daughter of Henry VIII. Her mother was executed when she was three. Already she has had a dificult life.Now, her father dies. Her younger brother, Edward, who is only nine, is now king. England is now ruled by advisers of the young boy. I won't tell the rest, but it is an awesome book. I recomend it to anyone!!"
5,"A Wonderful, Historic Read","This book was truly wonderful. I think it is the best in the Young Royals Series. I believe it gives great information about what really happened while being entertaining but not being fictionalized. I have a tip for readers who are interested in reading this book: Read Mary, Bloody Mary first as you'll know more of what's going on and beware, princess elizabeth will make more sense. If you are a fan of history, Queen Elizabeth or are just looking for a great read then look no further and read Beware Princess Elizabeth"
5,A Riveting Historical Fiction,"Carolyn Meyer paints a wonderful picture of what Elizabeth's teenage years must have been like. This narrative, a historical fiction, tells of Elizabeth Tudor's years after her brother Edward's death and into her elder half-sister's reign. The rebellions and suspicions cast upon Elizabeth put her life in terrible danger, sending her to the tower where her mother was executed years earlier. It's a great book, especially for those of you guys and gals that lovedElizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor, England, 1544 (The Royal Diaries), this one is more geared towards the young adult market with its language and content. However, this novel doesn't focus on Elizabeth's romantic escapades like some novels do, just her struggle to maintain her faith and her life under her sister's ever watchful gaze. It is a great book, and I highly recommend it. :)"
3,Not the best of Ken Follett,"I've read a lot of Ken Follett, and Whiteout I'd rate at the second to worst of his books. Not that's it's bad, thus the three stars, but it's almost written in an amateurish style...very predictable characters, predictable plot, but still well-written and entertaining. Quick read."
2,over-milking the suspense,"It started out good. But the ending drags exceptionally too long, and even worse, in a predictable way.At the ending, Follett milked the suspense too much that the only thing coming out was a bland liquid. I listened to the Books on tape, and had to fast forward since disk 9 (of 11). From disk 9 on, it was like riding a roller-coaster that keeps rolling around the same loop 100 times too many: the villain arose fromdeath, gun was out of ammo; no mobile phone to find, but when one was found, it had no battery ...The story pace became stalled , despite all the actions."
2,It Gets By,"This was an OK read, which is unfortunate for a writer such as Ken Follet whom we hold to such a high standard simply because of his evident talent which cannot be questioned. A little more heavy on the description compared to his past works which rely more on plot twists. The setting was nice, very ominous for sure, but the latter plot fell a little short of expectations created in the first half of the book. Maybe not as heart pounding as say Chetan Dave's Datoga Island or Michael Crichton's State of Fear but it's still worth reading once."
5,To have a good time,"Albeit this book is not a thriller, nor a love story, nor a medical story it'll hook you to read it fast. Sometimes you'll guess what will happen next but you won't be able to put it down. The way the laboratory manages the virus and its personnel lacks in security all the time but that doesn't mean that is out of reality or it can't happen in many laboratories. So don't read this book thinking that is a Robin Cook or Michel Palmer's medical thriller and you'll like it."
3,Not his best work,"Ken Follett has written some of the best thrillers in the genre but has fallen short on his last couple of outings, namely ""Whiteout"" and ""Code to Zero"". Whiteout has all the ingredients for a thrilling suspense story, but never really gets off the ground. A rather contrived romantic interest slows the book down and really contributes nothing to the plot. The last third of the book gets going fairly well, but then seems to end abruptly. It almost seemed as if the author got tired then decided to end the book when there was much more excitement that could have been explored. The elements of a good suspense thriller were there; deadly viruses, horrendous snow storm, terrorists, crooks on the run but these plot lines were not well developed. Still, it is a fair read, just not up to Follett's earlier books. Wait for the paperback."
2,What happened to Ken Follettt?,"After reading this book, I may say that the author suffered from a 'whiteout' while writing it. It is quite boring: suffers from the lack of action and poor psychological portraits of the characters. Let's hope that it was only the low temperature from the book that froze the hand and pen (or is it the PC) of Ken Follett. I wish he could write more excellent books like ""The Pillars of the Earth"" or ""Eye of the Needle""."
2,Whiteout,A book by Ken Follet is normally a guarantee of a well written intrigue that keeps the reader spellbound however in Whiteout he falls short. The characters are not well developed nor is the plot which had a lot of potential. Not up to the authors usual standards and a disappointment to a long-time fan.
1,Did Follet really write this - or did Danielle Steele?,"I'll start by saying I'm a big Follett fan - and have read all of his books. But this is the worst I've ever read.Instead of historical intrigue - which provides a history lesson as well as an engaging plot, this one is filled with sex, is totally predictable and doesnt provide any new information that Michael Crighton hasnt covered extensively in the past.And less than 350 pages? Where is the Pillars of the Earth tome? If I had been given the book without knowing the author, I'd have guessed Danielle Steele. Oh well, at least my wife can read it."
2,Is this really Follett?,"Is this really Ken Follett? The plot is drawn out, the language stilted, and the dialogue amateurish. Makes me wonder if he has farmed out his work to a student. Stick to his other books - any of them!"
5,CD Review of Whiteout,"The book came to me in the promised number of days, and it's in good decision."
3,Mediocre,"WHITEOUT is a suspense thriller about biological terrorism. The story begins with the discovery that samples of a deadly virus are missing from a small pharmaceuticals company and a lab technician is dead, an apparent victim of the virus. Most of the novel's action takes place in a remote cottage. Follett is usually a good storyteller whose skills reflect his early training as a newspaper reporter. This book, however, is only mediocre and falls far short of the standard set by some of his ealier works such as EYE OF THE NEEDLE and THE KEY TO REBECCA."
2,Boring.,"I quit reading this halfway through, and it's a Ken Follett novel!! I love Ken Follett--or, I guess I have to say I USED to love Ken Follett. I quit this book about one third of the way through. I didn't really care about the characters, and the plot seemed to take forever to get anywhere. I liked the heroine, but her having the hots for the old geezer grossed me out (I'm 46, a romance writer, and it STILL grossed me out). When they hugged and she was instantly wet, I was starting to check out. I visited here first, to make sure I wasn't going to miss anything, and I wasn't. So I decided my time was better spent on another book."
2,"If it were anyone else, 3 stars","I have to agree with most of the bad reviews for this book. It didn't have the flow one would expect from Follett, and the climax was okay, at best. If this book was from most any other author, I probably would have given it 3 stars, but after reading Jackdaws, Hornet Flight, Code to Zero, and a few others, this just didn't compare.Truth be told, it was probably a good book, just not by Ken Follett standards."
1,Who wrote this dreadful book?,"This book was written by some writing student, not possibly by Follett. Its beyond ridiculous. Sheila Wolfe"
2,Wasted pages,"This is my first Ken Follett novel. And my primary problem with this book is that I feel entirely to much time and pages were wasted on the ""family"". Halfway through the book and I'm still waiting for the crime to be committed. I have 2 more of his books that I purchased, and if they're anything like this one, I won't buy any more, even at $.01."
4,Best thing he has written in a long time,"While nothing measures up to PILLARS OF THE EARTH, WHITEOUT is certainly in the league of EYE OF THE NEEDLE.The action takes over a brief time period. The story goes as follows: Brilliant scientist developes an anti-viral drug. Bad people want to steal it. To do so they must defeat well guarded lab and overcome a state-of-the-art computer system.That's the bare bones of the plot, and without giving anything away there are enough twist turns and backflips to make this book a winner.Only bad spot is the epilogue. You already know everything by then.A great read."
2,Whiteout---Washout,"I've read other Follett books, begining with his first, ""The Eye of the Needle,"" and have often wondered why he doesn't seem to get the notoriety of other writers. Whiteout has left me with little hope that he will. The premise is great, but the story- telling leaves much to be desired. Scottish castle, bio-tech hazard, winter storm, feuding family, Christmas gathering... are there any more cliches?? All I kept saying was, ""this is the guy who wrote ""Eye of the Needle??"""
1,Literature cliché after cliché,"I have read Follett in the past with much satisfaction, particularly ""Pillars of the Earth"". However, Whiteout made my jaw drop by how truly bad his writing has seemingly become. Its not that his prose is particularly bad, its just that he uses cliché after cliché to formulate Whiteout's story. Some reviewers have pointed out plot holes, but I was irked by simple things dealing with character interactions that seemed way to ""convenient"". I could go through the text and pull out some examples, but I have already wasted too much of my life by reading it the first time. I like Pillars enough to still potentially read more Follett in the future, but this particular book was flat out laughable. Life is way too short to be reading bad fiction like this."
1,Follett is disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Follett and absolutely enjoyed his earlier novels (Pillars of the Earth, Night over Water, Dangerous Fortune, etc.). However, sadly, his recent novels have lost its edge. Code to Zero, Jack Daws, and now Whiteout is boring. Slow and boring."
3,"Good, but not captivating","Having read twelve of his novels I find this one enjoyable but not up to the usual. It is very steady, well written and easy to follow but something I cannot state is missing whatever ingredient that may be. Don't think this novel is mediocre,it is far from it, I just could not get the usual feeling when reading one of Mr. Follett's novels. Having said all that I would also say read it it was enjoyable."
1,This is supposed to be a thriller?,"My only regrets about reading this book are that I can never get back those 6 hours I wasted, and I'm probably too late to warn many of you not to waste your time either. I would expect 2-dimensional characters in a genre thriller, but Follett has managed to populate this book with 1-dimensional characters or worse. To top it off, there is no ""thrill"" in this thriller - most of the book is unneccesary detail and it truly never gets to the frightening prospect of bio-terrorism. This is simply a heist novel, and not a very good one at that. The plot is miniscule and he fills page upon page with boring, irrelevant description. There are no unexpected events to provide a thrill - I could have told you the ending after reading the first 20 pages. In short, as a thriller this book is a dud."
5,"Thriller Gives New Meaning to ""A Cold Sweat!""","Racing along with this story is akin to riding blindfold in the back of a speeding pickup truck on a curving road, knowing that if the excitement doesn't get you, then the next curve probably will! The approiate title did not warn me of the dangers of being thrust beyond the theshold of my comfort zone, even though I found my excitement level there quickly. However, I was unable to stop pushing on and didn't want the book to end, yet I couldn't wait to get there. Mr Follett has written another ""Humdinger,"" as we say down south and I sure hope his creative jucies continue flowing for a long time to come!- Dwight Spencer, Greensboro, NC USA"
2,Overhyped,"A wildly positive description led me to buy this, hoping to be captivated. Two hundred pages later, it started to take off. The unique aspects of the story, the biohazard and deadly aspects of the virus, have been seen elsewhere--from THE HOT ZONE, on. The plot is clunky as the author corrals innocents and villains into a house in a blizzard. We are told that one can spy on the action in the kitchen, from above--CLUNK! We are told individually about each cell phone in the house and why the innocents can't use them--CLUNK! CLUNK! The family members have such little characterization, it's difficult to keep track of them. A description of sex play is tacked on at the end and out of place with the book's tone. The writing is quite pedestrian, as if Follett were just lending his name to the thing. I'll look for recommendations of the better Folletts--like Eye of the Needle, and Key to Rebecca."
2,Typical Follett,"Very typical sound book from a solid author there just aren't any surprises. The book like Jackdaws and Flight of the Hornet is totally predictable but unlike those two previous books he teaches us nothing new. Hot Zone is more informative on bio-safety issues.Pillars of the Earth was his last great effort. These new books seem to have a formula spelled out early in the book, characters developed while the plot lingers, then the formula executed to a prictable end.A once great mystery writer and someone who wrote a great historical piece just mails in another tome and we buy it hoping for the old Ken"
2,Not Follett's Best,"It's just ok. It's no ""Key to Rebecca"", that's for sure.The main character, Toni, came off to me as the most insecure Security Director of all time, frequently second-guessing herself and struggling with her competence and inner feelings. That came off as a bit pathetic to me. An interesting character in Daisy though.The romance aspect felt sappy and quite ""token"". I felt this to be completely predictable and probably unnecessary. I even found myself literally rolling my eyes at these laughable portions of the story.The tempo strikes a remarkable change about halfway through, once the heist kicks in. Page-turning, thankfully, gets much easier at that point.All in all, an average (at best) bedtime book, but I was let down, and feel that it didn't come close Follett's true potential."
3,Just OK - I expect more from Follett,"An ok read if you have nothing else to do, but I expect more from Ken Follett. Pretty formulaic as other reviewers have mentioned. Characters are mostly dull, romantic theme is totally without spark. In this 'life-and-death' situation, I could hardly bring myself to care. Playing on popular themes, Follett writes about a 'deadly virus' - but there's no interesting science here, its pretty mundane. If you want a thrilling book about deadly viruses, read Laurie Garrett's book ""The Coming Plague"" - and its true!! About the best I can say for this Follett book is that I made it through to the end. Three stars is probably generous, but I like Follett's other books - mostly the early ones."
1,WARNING--Follett's worst,"I have never written a review before but this novel was SO bad, it prompted me to warn others against it. I agree with the writer who questioned whether Follett had gone senile. I am questioning my own sanity for trying to finish it.I was brought up to finish what you start, especially books--so I persevere but will not admit to my 2 children who are English teachers that I'm going to finish such a gabork. Who knows, it may redeem itself in the last 100 pages--(but I doubt it).I thought Pillars of the Earth was a great book. Eye of the Needle--a remarkable thriller. I've always looked forward to his latest but this is such a waste of time, I read it to fall asleep.Grandmanan"
2,Where's the editing?,"I was surprised to see a novel by an experienced pro that had such terrible stretches of writing in it. Would not have finished if it hadn't been a club selection. Got better nearer the end, where the action picks up.So where was the editor? Is Follett so big that they can't tell him when something is clunky and amateurish? Awkward info dumps, cardboard characters, and too much that is thrown in to see what sticks. Way too many superfluous beatings, errors, and convenient plot devices. And in this part of Scotland, apparently most of the populace drives expensive luxury cars. Um...Yes, there are good things, but they are overshadowed by the things that aren't. If professional publishers and writers are going to put out something so much in need of editing that it says they don't care, it shows what contempt they hold readers in. ""Aw, they'll buy it anyway, because it's a Follett!""News flash-- we expect better!"
2,whiteoutblah,"I am a Ken Follet fan who was really disappointed by the book ""Whiteout"". After such works as ""Pillars of the Earth"", ""World Without End"" ""A Gathering of Eagles"" and many, many other books of his - this one was a crashing bore. It is almost as though Mr. Follet used a hack ghost writer and signed his name to it for money!"
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed by this book.It was recommended to me by a friend, and I was told that it is so gripping that once I would start reading it I would not be able to let it down. It took me almost 6 days to finish reading it, and I wanted to give up more than once. The story is very typical: A gang steals a lethal virus from a lab to sell to a terrorist group, and at the end they get caught, and the virus is never released into the air. Nothing thrilling about this plot. There are no twists or surprises. Too much time is spent describing, in my opinion, shallow characters. When action is taking place and the reader feels immersed in the novel, the author manages to interrupt the thrill by long dialogue between the characters and the description of their shallow personalities. I only kept reading because I was waiting for a twist, which never came."
2,Boring,"I usually love Ken Follett's books. This book could not hold my interest. Even though it's a relatively short book, It seemed to drag on forever. Don't let this sour you on Ken Follett though, most of his books are top-notch (Pillars of the Earth, Dangerous Fortune, Eye of the Needle, Hornet Flight among others)."
4,Follett's best 'modern' novel,"As a long-time fan of Follett, I find this novel to be his best work set in a modern timeframe. Drawing on the recent style of describing high paced, suspense events in a short timeframe (ie. tv show 24), Follett scores by giving us vivid scenes and deep characters.Our heroine is not the cookie-cutter brand of bedeviled woman finding her strength. She is drawn as a character who is strong and shows her depth. She is not without self-doubt and reflection. The cast of characters that surround the story at varied and intense. The interdependicies and relationships are intriguing and beguiling.This was an easy read and thoroughly enjoyable."
1,Eh,"Its been said that every story has been told at least once. Ken Follett has mastered the art of telling the same story over and over again... seventeen times, in fact.In Whiteout, Follett tries to cover a little-explored genre of the adventure/ suspense novel: bioterrorism (I'm being sarcastic). Whiteout covers a period of two days- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The protagonists of the story are shallow, and the antagonists are badly put together and seem to have no motive for what they do- apart from the fact that they seem to like bloody, gory murder and revenge of the most jeuvenile kind.Follett reuses the same plot that other writers have in the past. There is nothing new, exciting or suspenseful in this book. In short, this is a book which should be left on the shelf. If you really insist upon reading it, check it out of the library- don't waste your money."
4,"Follett, ""What's going on?","I liked it as far as a mystery goes-- but his GREAT ones were ""Pillars of the Earth"" ""Key to Rebecca"" and most of his earlier novels. I can find a book like this by 100 authors, but his first books were one of a kind by a ""one of a kind author."" Please come back (or go back) I want to pick up a classic my next read by Ken."
1,Follett has Lost it,Do not read any of Follett's books after Night Over Water. Third Twin was terrible and Whiteout is worse. I have been a loyal fan since Eye of Needle but I won't be reading any new Follett. Trust me. If you are going to buy this book based upon your enjoyment of Follett's previous work you will be disappointed. Unless of course you enjoyed Third Twin in which case knock yourself out.
2,Michael Nails,"Mr. Follett has a great idea, but the reasons for the villain's actions were the weakest aspect of the story. The idea of using Biohazard material as the central theme was grabing at straws. Follett never gets into the real thiller aspect of this theme. The policeman in charge should have been sent to ""how to"" school, because he was the lamest cop I have ever read. A real throw back to the dark ages. The lead--protagonist--was the best part and she is a credit the book. However, there should have been more one on one with her and her future husband. All in all a fair book, but nothing the savor the night through."
2,Improbable twists and turns,"I am definitely a Ken Follett fan, but this novel must have been written in haste without the usual Follett craftsmanship. The many improbable twists and turns, instead of creating a feeling of suspense, leave one feeling rather manipulated by the author."
2,Whiteout,"Ken Follet's characters were poorly developed. Pretty much a ""formula"" written book that required the reader to suspend any critical thinking skills they might possess."
3,good book,not one of my favorite ken follett but still allright read. Pillar of the earth is his best one and still better then at worlds end
3,Well...,"Not the best Ken Follett book I ever read, but it was still a nice read. I would recommend reading this book if you're waiting at a airport, in a doctor's office, or some such, or if you're bored and sick and want something to read after you're sick of watching TV. Not that this book sucked, but it could have used more. The idea was very good, but it fell flat on delivery in some places, and the ending was a bit cliched. If Ken had put in more detail and thought, this book would have delivered better. I'd say three and a half stars is a fair rating for this book."
3,"Good, but not his best....","my two favorite authors, demille and follett came out with books, only weeks apart. they are both fabulous writers, but both novels were a touch below their standards. i still enjoyed this one a lot. Follett is a great writer and i couldn't put this one down easily...."
2,too predictable...,"I can't claim to be a K.Follett expert - but I read 'The Pillars of the Earth' as well as 'A Place Called Freedom' and enjoyed both (especially the Pillars of the Earth). However, 'Whiteout' confirmed my suspicion that once you have read one K.Follett you have read them all: too many coincidences, characters that are 'good' or 'bad' as of page one and a story where you can assume how it will end as soon as you completed the first few chapters. 'Whiteout' bears very few suprises and that I was able to predict in what situations K.Follett brings in his famous erotic twists is not really a good sign...I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Worst novel by Follett ever!,"Ken Follett is one of my all time favorite authors. Very hard to beleive this was written by him. This book is NOT recommended, unless you want to be bored, and disappointed."
2,Why does anybody read Follett anymore?,"There was a time when this guy was one of my favorite authors, cant say that anymore.Scotland, snow, and the ebola virus. Three things you should venture to stay away from.Oh wait, let me add a fourth. Overfluffed Ken Follett novels."
4,Tongue in Cheek,"I love Ken Follett and this book was no exception--another page turner. However, I suspect that Mr. Follett had a tongue firmly planted in cheek in writing this book. I kept thinking it would make a great comedy."
1,Should have been shelved.,This is not Ken Follett's best work. This is the story of a young woman who works as a security chief for a biochemical corporation who has a very dangerous virus stolen. I got through less than the first third before giving up on this dog. The plot seemed like it was going to be predictable without the familiar spunk that gives Ken Follett his signature style. Read Jackdaws or The Man From St. Petersburg if you want that edge of your seat excitement he's known for.
1,Appalling!,"It's a long time since I read such a bad book, surely the author was drunk when he wrote it?And his publisher, how did this get through the net?Were it a book in the 'young adults' category, it would still be insulting."
3,OK,"If someone asked me whether or not I would recommend this book, I would say no. Poor character development, poor character carry through, and somwhat predictable (if you've read Ken Follett before). I did enjoy reading it though because of the non stop action."
4,Follett keeps you turning the pages,"With White Out, Follett pulls together the ingredients for a great story. Set in the present day, Follett spins a tale focused on a multi-generational, dysfunctional family together in a remote Scottish estate for the Christmas holiday. The patriarch of the family is a brilliant scientist who created and runs a nearby medical research laboratory. As the story unfolds, the reader is introduced to a group of nefarious individuals intent on launching a biological terrorist attack in London. Character development is strong. Human frailties are exposed. A series of sub-plots run throughout, adding depth to the main storyline. Although the story starts a little bit slow, White Out becomes an impressive, fast-paced tale, full of intrigue, twists, and turns that are classic Follett. Once you start reading, it will be difficult to stop."
2,"I Love Follett's Books, But not this one","I Love Follett's Books, But not this one...Wow, this was bad. No wait this was BAD. The plot was thin, the dialogue Worse. It started so well, good premise, decent storyline. Then about half way through it started to fade, and then even worse it turned into an unbelievable compilation of nonsense and fluff.I will still buy any book by Follet I can find, but I think this one is best left as a pass."
5,DYNAMIC!,"Bradley's debut album. This album is fun and upbeat and fantastically dynamic! I LOVE every single track but my personal favorites are THE BRIDGE and GOODBYES, and of course, ROSE COLORED GLASSES!"
3,Not a good cap pistol,"I have the very same pistol from 1949. The only differences are the orange plug in the barrel to indicate it's not real and new one is stamped ""Made in China"". I must say I was flabbergasted to find it was nearly indistinguishable from my old one. And just like my old revolver this one makes a lousy cap pistol. It's very difficult to load and even if you can load it the caps do not advance well. DON'T BUY THIS IS YOU WANT TO USE IT AS A CAP PISTOL. IT SUCKSO! And the loading gate is easly damaged and will flop open all the time. This was true on my 1949 model and it's true for this one."
1,It's a documentary - - no songs.,I guess I didn't interpret the description correctly; it's just narration and some interviews. I was expecting more of a greatest hits collection. :-(
2,Christmas Cookie Sprinkle Snitcher,"This is a fun children's book, but it doesn't have to cost that much money. Why is it so expensive? Ridiculous!"
3,Did not live up to the wonderful reviews,I purchased this book based on the great reviews I read. The rhythm of the rhymes is off a bit making for an unbalanced flow when the book is read aloud. Story is a good idea.
1,Beware of this product if you own a cordless phone!,"After using a Netgear access point, which died after one year, we decided to replace it with the USRobotics 2249 access point. It seemed to work okay at first, but suddenly started dropping the users (3 of us) constantly. We continued to use it to try and see what might be causing the drops. Finally, we called USRobotics (no 800 number, of course...), and we were informed that this unit is ""sensitive"" to 2.4Ghz cordless phones!"
1,cd quality poor,for some reason this cd would not play in my car stereothere is only 2 songs on this cd so the first inch of the cdwas clear maybe that had somethig to do with it
5,"Move over, dinosaurs and prehistoric reptiles!","This is the best book on prehistoric animals I've ever spent money on! Even better than walking with dinosaurs! The photos are nearly real, if not completely, the information is wonderful for everyone age 11 and up, and every piece of the book is perfect for all who like cool animals, prehistoric or modern day! My favorite was the chapter with the Smilodons(they are my favorite prehistoric animal of all time, of course!)It was cool, and so were all the other huge chapters! Oh, and the mammoths rocked, as well, I might add. I will tell you this, too-this book is educational and fun. You should give it to any nature lover! It is absolutely superb. I recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in nature and/or history!"
3,"great ""walk"" but no encyclopedia","This book has ""photographic"" illustrations of 26 (give or take) different mammals with short (way too short and sketchy) info inserts. The bulk of the book is the narrative which you have to be pretty determined to read thru for any additional info. The story mostly depicts specific encounters between animals and is not always convincing (in my opinion). In short, this book is NOT an encyclopedia of prehistoric mammals."
5,MADDEN IS AWESOME!,This game is great. when i first played it i was frightened by how real the players looked. This game is so clear and detailed. When its cold you can see the player's breath its so awesome. the play of the game is god to . you dont have to read the manual when you first play ITS THAT SIMPLE! all and all this is a great game.
5,this is a must,"I must say that this was a pleasant surprise. I have been playing ""Blitz 2001"" since it came out and didn't realize that I wanted a more challenging game. This was the one I was waiting for and didn't even know it! First things first....the graphics are amazing! The game takes some getting used to, but it does come to you quickly enough. A nice bonus was to be able to select from teams of old. Have you ever wanted to be the '75 Steelers? How about the '85 Bears? You can and much more. Have you ever wanted to be a GM? Build the ultimate fantasy football team that YOU control! If you love football and you don't get this one, get your head checked out!"
4,Good Football Game To Start The New Life Of Sony's PS2!,"The game play is great! The create a player kicks so bad that it could leave you there for a hour doing so. The only problems I found in it was it took to much time to save and load and the controls somehow seem to change during the game. Overall, it is a fun 4+ player game as well as 1 or 2 players."
4,GREAT GAME,"Madden 2001 is THE best football game out there. The graphics will blow you away and the gameplay is on point. But thats not all! The sound is terrfic. When a player gets tackled, you can really feel and hear it. The only problem with this game is the commentary. Pat Summerall and John Madden sound so lame. They show no emotions like the commentary in the NFL Gameday games. Overall, Madden is one game that you have to get for your PS2. I hope they will fix the problems on Madden 2002"
3,"O.K., but NFL2K1 is much better","Although this game has been hyped as the best football game out, in my opinion, NFL 2K1 is a much better game. To begin, NFL2K1 just seems much more realistic. The player models are more realistic, making the game play better. The flow of the game just doesn't seem to work, and it can get frustrating trying to control a player, especially on defense. If you own both systems, there is no question that you should buy NFL2K1, which is the ideal football game. If you don't own a Playstation 2, don't worry, its not worth all the hype. Wait until some good games come out."
5,Madden 2001 vs. NFL 2K1,I have a friend who has NFL 2K1 and another who has Madden 2001 and let me tell u Madden is a whole lot better. The people in 2K1 are 2 tall and skinny looking. the people in madden however look awesome. especially line backers and defensive line men. plus its a whole lot more fun. i wuz playin NFL 2K1 and i got sick of it in bout 30 minutes. my friends did 2. then i played madden 2001 and we played almost none stop from about 12pm 2 about 3am. madden is just all around better than 2K1. no doubt about it. and by the way all u people who think dreamcast is better should stop while ur ahead. u look stupid and in a couple of years u'll feel stupid 2. in the beginning playstaion wuz pretty bad and now its one of the highest sold console ever.
4,Almost there... A great step forward in Football Gaming.,"The graphics in this game are the best I've ever seen in a football game. With several modes of play, you could enjoy this game for years. Against other people, this gameplay is realistic. You cannot simply throw 80 yard pass plays all game. The only drawback is playing defense against the computer. I've always found some way to compete defensively in the most recent football games, but stopping the computer from passing against you is near impossible. But against other players, this is the best I've ever seen."
1,Game Freezes when trying to play a game!!!!,"I purchased this game on May 15, 2001 and I could not play a game. After contacting Sony Support they said a lot of people are having this problem if they have a PS2 from the after Christmas production but a Madden 2001 from before Christmas. You can send your PS2 back to Sony for service, no idea if it is free or not. My choice is to not buy this game and wait for Madden 2002 due out in the fall. Shame on Sony and EASports for having no warning about this on either of their websites. This glitch only affects the Madden 2001 game since it was designed based on a prototype to be one of the first 5 games released. Other than that the PS2 is great."
3,Good,"Madden 2001 is the most visually stunning football game ever. The game simply amazed me the first time I saw it. But when I started to play it, I noticed a problem. The running is too smooth, and the tackling is too hard. I swear, my friend and I were playing and whenever we handed the ball off we'd get around 7-12 yards per carry. It turned the game into a shootout, we were scoring every drive.If you can overlook that problem, the game is amazing. The passing is highly realistic and the graphics are superb.I recommend this to anyone with a PS2; it's a must have."
4,So Close To Perfect You Can Taste It,"This game has unbelievable graphics, good gameplay, and a great Franchise mode. This is without a doubt the best sports game for the Playstation 2. The only problem with this game is stopping the opposing quarterback. Call me crazy but Akili Smith is not supposed to put up 600 passing yards against the Patriots' excellent defense. Learn to play a little D, and this game is a football dream come true!"
5,Madden 2001,"Madden 2001 is absolutely amazing. Graphics are stunning. It's almost as if you are watching football on tv with the cut scenes in between plays. I'm not even a die hard football fanatic and I found myself playing for hours without even knowing it. My wife bought it for me so it's her own fault why I'm surgically attatched to this game. The sounds are great, you can tell when you really nail a guy by the sounds. The only flaw I see with this game is the realism of the hits are a bit off. The bodies bend a little unrealistically with some hits. Now I'm looking for stuff to pick at as the game is overall unreal. The lights even reflect in the helmet for goodness sakes. It's so real.....If you own a PS2, you have no choice but to own Madden 2001."
5,Madden 2001 PS2 rocks!,"By far the best football sim ever! I have the PC version also, and with the exception of online play, the PS2 version blows it away! If you like football at all and own a PS2, this is a MUST BUY!"
5,Review,"Really good game, (I'm using my aunt's screen name). Graphics are simply incredible, and I enjoy taking on good teams and beating them. I like the commentary, but it's really personal preference. (BTW, lots of people don't like Madden, and want him to shut up. Cripes, if you would just take time to look around under Settings, guess what? There's a little on/off button for Commentary. You can also adjust the sometimes frusteratingly stupid defensive/offensive A.I. from here.) Finally, just pick your favorite team, (or one from the past, if your favorite present day team stinks), and get going! MY personal choice: Titans. The only thing frusterating is the the All teams (I guess the best of each position that a team ever had,) and the teams from the past, all use numbers on their names and commentary instead of their names! Maybe if they put it on a DVD.."
1,Straght Up-Just listen,"Ok I agree Ps2 Is powerful, and it has a lot of perks. The Dvd is a great feature, and a few of them games look good, but open your eyes. Dreamcast is half the price, and has over 200 good games, over 50 of them are AAA games. As for Madden NFL 2001, It is a good game, I have no doubt, but it is not the best football game. NFL 2k1 for dreamcast has as good as graphics, more options and INTERNET PLAY. With Dreamcast and NFL2k1 You can play anyone anywhere with dreamcast, isn't that a feature that PS2 sure doesn't have. As for the dvd, for the price of PS2 you can buy a dvd player and dreamcast. Oh and by the way, you can actually buy a dreamcast now, unlike the 6-12 month wait for ps2."
3,"Cool Game, but still unrealistic","The graphics are the best thing on this game. Old Maddens may have been plagued by too much defense -- 2001 is plagued by too much offense. Playing the computer gets very old very quick. There are times when the computer can NOT be stopped, no matter what you do (and this is only the PRO level). You blitz to try to force pressue, and they burn you. You anticipate a pass - they WILL complete it no matter what. I have not seen a game where the computer did not have at least one 80+ yard RAC (run after catch).I don't know why there can't be a 'complete' madden - one that is visually stunning as well as REALISTIC.If you want a game where you trade touchdowns, this is it. If you want a game that isn't 100% offense, look elsewhere or wait."
1,Not even close to NFL2k1,"This game is wack. I'm sorry, but the players look like Blitz players, the control is off, the field looks choppy, the crowd looks like a painting and as always Madden comes up short of making a good game. NFK2K1 has more realistic movements, fields, player sizes, and just gameplay. I can pick up NFL2K1 and know exactly where the ball is going to go. If you know how to play real football, you will know how to play NFL2K1. If you like simulating NFL game expierence, you will like NFL2k1. Madden is disappointing. I have both and you will like NFL2K1 a lot more."
2,madden isnt all that great,"i bought madden 2001 expecting it to be awsome, but i was verydissapointed with it, in fact i though is [was not very good], the graphics arent what they are supposed to be. Madden games just arent what they used to be. I am waiting now for nfl gameday and monday noght countdown for ps2."
1,"Open Your Eyes, Parents, Listen To ME!","Ok I agree Ps2 Is powerful, and it has a lot of perks. The Dvd is a great feature, and a few of them games look good, but open your eyes. Dreamcast is half the price, and has over 200 good games, over 50 of them are AAA games. As for Madden NFL 2001, It is a good game, I have no doubt, but it is not the best football game.

2,Big dissapointment!!!,I think this game is less than par. This game by no means is better than NFL2k1. The game play totally left me in a daze when playing defense. It seems that everything in this game is built around the offensive pass yet didn't take into consideration for defending the pass. I sometimes have double & triple coverage on a mediocre receiver and yet he still catches the ball. This really hurts my game because I love to play stiff hard nosed defense as NFL2K1 allows you to do. Dissapointing and wouldn't have purchased if I had know this.
3,No difference,"I thought madden 2001 would become even better than 2000 edition but i was wrong. The graphics changed but the linesmen are still 2d pictured. Now you may think who cares? And you might think that playing the game is exciting but it's not! The fans on fifa, nba, and nhl 2k1 became detailed and 3d modeled except madden! Now, the game is having trouble shooting aswell. It runs very very slowly that you may think you're playing golf instead of bone-crunching american football! Just think about what i said and remember, it's up to you if you want to order this game or not!"
1,ultimate question,1.who does this question go to? 2.if this question is not reviewed by ea sports or someone from the game manufacturers how do you reach them? 3.i would like to share my opinions of the game but i want it to fall on the right ears and would like to know if someone can point me in the right direction? 4.thank you very much and i hope you can help
5,John Madden is the best game I've ever played,"This is the best game yet. Last night I came downstairs and the demo was on of the Madden 01. I looked and turned around. I had to look one more time to make sure that it wasn't a real NFL game on TV. I haven't played Dreamcast NFL2K1 yet so I can't say how much better it is but if NFL2K1 is better, I'll pay 100 dollars just for the game. I believe Madden has outdone himself and I don't see how when 2002 comes out it can be any better. And if you are wondering how playstation2 is so much better then dreamcast, here's why. PSX2 has a DVD player and a DVD usually runs about 200 dollars alone. The 128 bits is really 128 bits not like Dreamcast's is really about 100 bits. All I can say is get the PSX2 it is worth 300 dollars and more."
5,Greatest Sports Game Ever,"Madden 2001 is by far the greatest sports game I've ever played, and I would consider myself an expert on sports games. The graphics are incredible. The players look like they would on an actual shot on TV, and instant replays are even better. The game play is also great. You can control basically anything in the game, and the AI actually makes winning a challenge. The only drawback I've found is the repetitive commentary from John Madden. However, this does not detract from the overall quality of the game. I highly recommend this game for any sports fans who actually have a PS2."
5,Stood in line for hours... no dissappointment!,"Sony has done it again. Stood in line at Walmart for 4 hours and finally got PSX2. Set it up as soon as I got home and it is simply AMAZING. Be sure to get Madden 2001... be sure to get PSX2. wow... just, wow."
3,Good but....,"Nice game, but if you own NFL2K1 for the Dreamcast, this is in no way an improvement over that.Madden 2001 seems to concentrate on the gfx and game presentation more than the actual gameplay. NFL2K1 is a better technically programmed game."
4,"Amazing Graphics, Play is Getting Better.","One major improvement over the previous Madden games is the player movement. The improvements are clearly visible when the player is catching the ball, taking a hit, getting the snap, etc. Some annoying parts are...A) The rosters require some shuffling if you want to get them to be accurate for this season (i.e Dolphins start Damon Huard at QB and JJ Johnson at HB, this was never the case this year.)B) Camera view makes it tough to see sideline action,C) Offensive plays broken down by athlete, some may like this, but I find it a little annoying when you are looking for a certain type of play.D) I still can't get a pass interference call, they are murdering my wideouts.E) Computer is still fairly stupid about clock management.F) Faces aren't very accurate, see Kurt Warner, he just looks like a monster."
5,Played it loved it,"I have played quite a few Football games but Madden is by far the best I've played. Its the most complicated and the easiest at the same time.. and because is for the PSX2 the graphics rock. If your a sports game fan, if your a football fan, or if your just looking for a game, get this one!!..I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
5,The Best Football Game Ever,"Tecmo football for NES was a fun game to play and done as well as a game could be done at that time. Madden 2001 has that level of fun, if not better, plus the added bonus of stunning graphics and gameplay to blow your mind.If you love or even mildly like football, this game will rock your world. It is fun to play against the computer in a season or in franchise mode (where you control a team through multiple seasons controlling every aspect of what your team does). You can create your own players and best of all is the Madden card feature. You play against the computer, earn madden points to allow you to buy packs of Madden Cards. The madden cards unlock historical players, historical teams, or give you powerups, plus a bunch of other neat stuff.If you are in need of the madden card set, send me an email. This is the ultimate football game, versus the computer or your friends. BUY it and you won't regret it."
4,If you like sports you'll love this!,"After not following American Football as i live in England, i was surprised to have found myself so engrosed in this game. After playing the game for a short while i was starting to learn all the plays and reading oppositions formations. I even found myself following the American games in reality. The graphics are close to photographic quality, and movements are mapped to almost perfection, right down to blinking and talking. This game is breath-taking, a must have for any sports lover!"
4,fun game even for non football fans,"this game looks great, plus its fun even for me and I only moderatly like football GO DOLPHINS but if you are going to spend the money get 2002, or 2003"
3,Time for everyone to give their yearly fifty to EA Sports,"Is this a fun game? Sure it is. It looks great. Play is fun too, the create-a-player feature is cool......and yet, this game leaves me feeling rather ho hum. The Madden series has evolved over the years, and across platforms, but at the end of the day it's the same old Madden with more makeup on. Maybe the beta version I got to fool with was stripped down, but almost everything looks very, very familiar as far as how the game is built.If PS2 is going to have lots of sports games, I strongly suggest Sony go the Dreamcast route and produce their own sports disks specifically for PS2. With Madden being a PS2/PSX/PC product, created generally for a variety of platforms, EA will never totally optimize a sports game to take advantage of the higher power the PS2 provides."
2,NO GOOD,"Nowhere near Madden 2001 for PSX1! Forget about ""giving him the business"" after the whistle because just like NFL2K1 the play is automatically stopped after the whistle. And you will know the play is stopped because the camera automatically zooms in on the player involved. After every play you will see a huge player, faces all the same, blinking until the choose play screen appears. Other disappointments include big arrow on kick offs making it simple, impossible to shed blocks and no 86 Giants-you got to be kidding! Listen--stick with the dreamcast. PSX2 launch is a joke(this is what I waited an extra year for) game developers are already anticipating the xbox and Maddens 2001 is no good."
3,Madden2001 is nothing compared to NFL2k1,You know Playstation 2 isn't all that good trust me.Madden2001 is nothing compared to NFL2k1 I mean the commentary on Madden is a piece of trash.And look at gameplay between those 2 Madden 2001 and NFL2k1 if you look real close at Madden2001 players there ugly.NFL2k1 players look much more realistic. If you want a good Christmas present parents get the Dreamcast and NFL2k1.You will love me for it.
1,Not too great.,"Wow. I bought this game along with the Playsation 2 at launch and there is only one word to describe it: DISAPPOINTING. This game looks okay, but the play control, frankly [is bad]. Just like all the other madden games, but with little improvements in the graphics department. This game doesn't even have CURVED LINES! All the ""curved"" lines seem jagged do to the lack of anti-aliasing. Even though in the commercial, it looks neat, but those clips are just the instant replays. Anyway, this game has nothing over Dreamcast's NFL2k1. 2k1 is soooo much better. It does have it's weaknesses, but not as much as this game. 2k1 has online play, curved lines, and it is easy ... to pick a play. I am not a sega loyalist, so this review is NOT biased. This game seems very rushed. If EA took a lot more time, this game will be very excellent next year. IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THE PS2 SEEM LIKE A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT??!! Oh well, believe what you want to, this is just my opinion."
1,DONT BUY THE HYPE LIKE I DID!,"This game is not all that great. Neither is the ps2. sure one day it will be as good as sony promised. (at least 5 years) but the differneces between dreamcasts nfl2k1 and madden 2001 are huge. Madden 2001 just has shiner looking players. thats IT! slightly better graphics. madden actually has fat looking players that dont look real, tackle real, or do anything real. they have the same animations and the ai is terrible. i own both games so i know what im talking about. NFL2k1 also has online play. Madden doesnt. Be happy with your dreamcast and dont even worry abouot the ps2 shortage. there isnt a reason to get one anyway."
5,Simply Magnificent,"This is such an amazing album. This album has a mixture of a R&B;, Old School, and Reggae feel. I was able to listen to this CD from the very beginning to the very end, while loving every song. Deitrick you did an awesome job on this one. You catered to every generation on the album while maintaining a strong impact on the new generation and keeping hold of the word.This CD is a must have! You will be blessed by it.From: Deitrick Haddon's new biggest fan."
5,My Husband's Favorite.......,"7 Daysis my favorite, but this is the one my husband loves! I like this one, too; it's just that this project leans more towards the traditional gospel style, while7 Daysis urban and aggressive, and that syle caters more to my musical tastes. Still one of the greatest gospel music projects ever recorded, though!"
3,The War Against Colonialism,This was mix between a reality and a documentary. It explains the troubles of terrorism in the past to the present. It is very interesting and informative. A must see for anyone interested in history and terrorism around the world.
1,Very cheaply made!,"Don't waste your money! I bought this for my 4 year old. The 1st time we used it, after the 3rd cast, it wouldn't reel in anymore. My husband took it apart and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't reel in. The fishing line was all over the place and my son was very disappointed that his fishing pole wouldn't work. My advice, don't waste your money! It's very cheaply made."
1,very disappointed in this product,"This was a huge disappointment. I bought this for my 4yo, and the reel jammed very quickly. When I unscrewed the top of the reel to untangle the line, it fell apart and was difficult to reassemble. There were no instructions for how to put it back together, but after about 30 minutes of puzzling over it, I did manage to get it working... and it broke again a few minutes later.I strongly recommend against purchasing this product. Look for a different rod and reel set."
1,Broke the first time,"We bought this for my son's 4th birthday. We opened it 1 month later on a camping trip (trashed the packaging) and it broke the first time he used it. Like the other review, it wouldn't reel in, also, the release button broke, seemed to be stuck, when we tried to fix it, it wouldn't screw back together. I wrote the company and am waiting to hear back. My daughter on the other hand has had a ""Finding Nemo"" fishing pole for 3 years and we have never had a problem with it!"
2,"Just another ""no"" vote, basically","OK, this is a little unorthodox, but here goes: I buy kids' fishing poles to use to entertain my cats - they go completely bonkers when I tie a lead sinker and some cellophone to the line (without the hook of course), then ""cast"" for them down our long hallway. It's an easy, fun way to play with them without spending a ton of money.I had this gear for only a few months when it fell apart. The cleat holding the reel to the pole is made out of flimsy plastic and one flange of it broke off. I was able to replace it for a while using electrical tape, but eventually I also started having trouble reeling it in, the top wouldn't stay screwed on, etc.It's a good length for my admittedly unusual use for it, but after so much trouble with the reel I replaced it with the Daiwa D-Fish Combo kit, with which I've been a lot more happy. You can also buy the D-Fish here on Amazon for about $20.Happy fishing!"
3,not a fine grind,The grind is very coarse. I like a fine grind. It adjusts but all the grind positions are chunky and coarse.
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love these grinders! I went searching for them. My father has some and I love the way it tightens ""backward"". If you tighten the screw clockwise, it lifts the burr grinder away from the stationary ring. Getting you a coarser grind. This means as I use it and the screw loosens it drops the burr grinder and I end up with a finer grind. possibly finer than I wanted. Easily remedied! With a couple of twists, I have coarse pepper! I hate it when a grinder loosens as I am using it and I end up with cracked peppercorns in my lovely Alfredo sauce. Ack! So, flip the thing over and watch the grinder as you ""tighten"" it. More space means bigger pepper! Lovely rubbed onto a steak! The thing that would make them better? If I could see through them! I have 5 different kinds of peppercorns separated into their own grinders. Now, which of you is the green pepper.........hmmm..."
1,Does not grind pepper/,What more do I need to say? Buy the French salt and pepper combination. It's not worth returning.
1,Don't waste your money.,"A pretty cool concept, I went with the cheaper ones because I orders scarecrows fangs last year and fell desperately in love, but didnt have the cash this year. The fangs themself are oversized, too big for my mouth, and I have a normally sized mouth. The dental putty DOES NOT set. followed instructions completely, but the putty wont set, making the teeth worthless. Invest a couple extra bucks and order something else, these will just dissapoint you and leave a green slimy dental putty sludged between your teeth."
1,waste of money,"These fangs ruined my costume. The putty does not work at all. I bought these from a Halloween store that had already almost sold out of them, so i thought they would be a good investment. I could not have been more wrong. I mixed the putty exactly how the directions described, and even tried again with the extra putty. I made sure my teeth and the product were dry before applying. Fun World needs to upgrade their putty or take this product off the market! what a waste of time and ten dollars."
4,Pretty good,"The title can be misleading, these are NOT flashcards. It is a book with 1 or 2 questions on each page. Overall, pretty solid with LOTS of questions."
5,Fast Flashcards,I was shocked to have my book arrive within less than a week of ordering it. Exellent Condition. I would recommend this book to anyone studing to be an EMT-Basic!
2,Not what I expected,"These are not flashcards, but a book in a 'flash card' format. The information is very basic and some of it is rather dated or just downright incorrect, but if you need help with getting the basics down, then this book might be for you."
2,Not a good study tool,The information in this book was very general and was not very good at preparing you for the EMT exam. There was also a disturbing amount of incorrect information or unupdated information in this book.
3,"OK, BUT NEEDS UPDATE","This book is a great concept - flashcards in book form - good for review anytime. However, going through the book I have found a few answers that are not up to date with current standards (the ratio of chest compressions to ventilations, for instance) and some that are just wrong (activated charcoal works by absorption? Not according to my textbook!). Still this book has great value as an adjunct to other study techniques, and has been good study aid. Just be prepared to double check any answers that don't seem right with your textbook or another resource because this book definitely has some errors."
4,Great review,This book is full of flashcards that are useful to prepare for NREMT exams! I particularly like that they include knowledge based questions AND scenario and critical thinking based questions. Get your noggin' working!
5,"We are human beings, not human doings.","These pages are perfect for those of us who are always looking for the perfect occupation, or searching for the right thing to do. The text offers very simple, quick exercises that bring us to the place of where we want to be...and the doing follows from there! It reminds us to ""be"", as we are human beings. Less emphasis is on ""doing"", because we are not human doings. I refer to this book often!"
5,Amazing!,"I love all works by Neale Donald Walsh but this little book was so powerful! An excellent book which makes you want to succeed in becoming the person you want to become. Which is a learning process over time so you may want to reread this book. Walsh writes with such depth but always light, easy to read and follow and flows quickly. This was truly an amazing book and you wouldn't want to miss it."
4,Good Book,This book ties into his other books well but also is understandable if you haven't read the prior books. It gives you ways to examine your life and make changes for the positive.
1,Bringers of the Light,"Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this book, as I see others reported similar experiences. I was charged $30.36 for the used paperback and when the book arrived it had a price of $11.00 printed on the back cover. Talk about a fleecing for a 74 page booklet! I thought Amazon.com was a more much reputable and ethical book distribution company than was my experience in this instance. What a disappointment."
3,Hummmm,"I was more than a bit taken back when I got this book.. For starters,the book that I received has a different picture on the front of the book than what Amazon/the seller had and I still cant.. For the life of me.. Figure out why some of the books with this title are going for $50 and the one that I was able to get was much cheaper. Not that Im not grateful, Im just wondering if its the same book or not. I did a little research quickly, and it appears as tho it is the same book.. By why is the page cover different and some of the asking prices on this book as much as up to $230.00??While the book itself is in decent conditions, its a very thin book, while I was expecting something much longer. I suppose the other questions I have are what is striking me. Im not so certain that I got the book I thought I was getting.Meichelle"
2,Bringers of the light,"Very dissapointing after CWG 1-3, and Friendship with God. Would not recommend this crumb from Neale Donald Walsch's table."
5,Great defense knife and a perfect gift for a Buddy too.,Purchased this as a defensive carry knife. The only issue I found was it is easy to bend the clip if the knife is not positioned to allow sitting in a car seat. I changed the clip mount to opposite side carry and the problem was resolved. I bought a second knife as a gift for a good friend. He loved it.
3,Practical,"It's a fixed blade, so beware of your local laws. It's well designed for defense and quick deployment. You can get a great grip on the handle.I'm not sure what kind of steel they use, but it's made in Taiwan."
4,cool knife,"fits behind belt, big enough and has a cool angle. Good quality! Mine came with a case and a clip. Easy in and out with the case, but holds in place great."
4,Great Insurance Policy !,"This unobtrusive little knife can really be a Great Life Insurance Policy !Yours !!!!It is very easy to handle. It is barely noticeable, and is ergonomically designed, and looks great, in a Tactical sort of way."
5,A no-nonsense SD knife that gets to the point,"The biggest plus for this knive is it affords sub-second ability to draw and present the knife in a SD (self-defense) situation.Pros:+ Ability to ""instantly"" draw and present+ Ability to draw with any hand, punch grip or karambit grip+ Razor sharp, straight from the factory+ Perfectly sized handle for small to medium hands+ Black powder-coating on the knife blade is great for concealment (vs. a shiny finish)+ The knife is light+ The new belt clip is a vast improvement over the old/original+ Excellent knife retention in the sheath+ Small sized blade should mitigate potential LEO-concern/""illegal"" perceptionCons:- The default vertical carry method is not the most comfortable. You can reposition the belt clip for horizontal belt carry, or take it off altogether and thread paracord through the eyelets of the knife sheath to create belt loops.Strongly recommended: 10/10"
5,Highly Recommended.,"As an ex-cop... I wish I had known about this knife back then! I never carried any knife on duty... but I would have carried this one! A few other things to consider (PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR STATE'S LAWS 1st)... The blade is less than 3"" so it does NOT require a concealed weapons permit to carry. VERY SOLID. Comes with the Kydex holster so you don't need to upgrade it (unless you want the ankle holster). You can also exchange out the screws and change it from right to left handed. I've learned to carry it on my left side and hold it with the blade side pointing out from my pinkie finger. Wish it was made in America though (Like a TRUE Ka-Bar). I'd pay more for it if it was."
5,Great Knife,"Well I was not sure at first if to purchase this knife or not because it didn't explain as to what it came with. The Knife comes with the stealth, belt clip, and a wrench. Its a Great knife and i strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a self defense weapon, its really easy to dray compared to a folding knife!"
5,Good knife,"I got this knife for my husband and he thoroughly enjoys it. The knife was very sharp when it came and we did not have to do anything to it to sharpen it.I guess the only thing I don't like about it is how easily you can cut yourself when taking it out of the sheath because of the design of the knife. But that isn't the product's fault. You just have to be careful when playing with sharp objects. Overall, I like it and my husband loves it so 5 stars :)"
5,Awesome knife,"Very concealing, easy to get a hold of , rests on the hip without getting in the way. This knife is super sharp and would do some serious damage, if need be. I wear this knife on my hip at work, where I can't carry a gun, and it's always at the ready. No one is the wiser. I love this knife, I carry it everyday, and highly recommend it. Good luck."
4,KA BAR TDI Knife,"Really cool last ditch knife. With the scabbard it fits on my duty belt and blends in next to my taser. Easy access, but not overly apparent. So far good knife with a good blade and I would recommend it."
3,"great knife, sheath is so so..",I purchased one for myself and another for a police friend. My sheath was not molded correctly which makes the knife one Inside the sheath very loose and prone to being taken. My friends sheath was molded tightly which makes the knife snug. Knife seems high quality but the sheath for me makes this knife what it is and I questioned returning it.
4,"Good knife, but.......","The knife itself is well made and relatively ergonomic. It serves its intended purpose well, but I would like to see an edge on the spine. From the tip to maybe 3/4"" up the spine would be a wonderful improvement. Overall I love the knife, BUT........NO SHEATH was sent with the blade!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Law enforcement Knife!,I bought this to knife to carry on duty right behind my duty belt (behind my mag pouch) easy to draw if needed during a fight to keep your weapon and great for the price!
1,Songs not performed by original artists,"I too received this set from a well intentioned friend who knows my music tastes. Sadly, the songs are not performed by the original artists but by the ""Countdown Singers"".Disappointed with the CD's as the arrangements are changed too."
2,Not much new.,"Not much new information is given to the hard-core Ewan McGregor fan. It is a pre-teen fan book. I think it is a waste of money, you'll find the same informations searching the net."
2,"Small, Sweet, and Cute","Some days you just can't get through the day without a quick shot of Ewan McGregor. This little 2"" x 2"" book is perfect for stuffing in your purse or desk when you just can't get enough of the kilted kutie. Of course, nothing is new in the pages, just some juicy color photos of the Scottish phenomenon, but it's really for those who have to have the tiniest little book ever printed about Ewan McGregor. Too cute for it's own good."
4,If your a hockey fan get it!,"Basically, the only reason I buy gaming systems is to upgrade hockey. This was definetly a worthy upgrade! The graphics are the best I've seen so far, sound is good, and playablity is excellent. The commentating is good but as usual it tends to get a little repetative. The AI is a little soft, with one time through a season you can effectivly spank any team. The power play advanage works much better and the multitude of shots is fantastic. You can actually deflect shots! I have experienced some minor glitches,but its nothing that can't be fixed with a quick restart. What happened to saving user records? I could care less about the create a player mode. I just want to be able to have bragging rights and have the stats to back it up. The best Hockey game out there so far, but still not perfect. Hopefully in the next one they'll put a few more details into it like the gatorade bottle on the goalie's net."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!,"I am the biggest fan of hockey games for playstation, and I was geeked when this came out. My friends and I cracked a few brews, and started to play. Well in 2 player mode, there is a glitch in the game. If you dish from mid ice, that is hit the puck in the air,or between the blue lines at the goalie it goes in everytime. Its so weak. You would think that the folks at EA would hirer some compent testers. Do not buy this!!!!"
2,Very disappointing,"I bought 989 Sports' NHL Faceoff 2001 for PS1, which is a far better game than this embarassing title from EA. The gameplay here is a total joke, nothing remotely like real hockey. It's hard to follow the play, the frame-rate slow-down is very annoying, goals go in bizarre, random ways, and the checking and positioning of the players is unrealistic. In short, a bad game, with great graphics."
2,Game Play is Most Important,"I've owned every generation of hockey since Activision released 2-on-2 hockey for the Atari 2600. I believe, and all of my friends agree, that 989 NHL Faceoff by far has the best game play of any hockey game ever created. If you appreciate ""realistic"" game play that is. While EA is esthetically pleasing, and has a lot of neat gimmicks, the actual game play doesn't compare to 989. The checking is unrealistic and exaggerated, fighting is a joke, players do not go to the net as much, and you have to skate around the zone for half the period waiting for a play to develop, and it rarely does. I'm so disappointed with the game play that I've gone back to playing 989 hockey for the original Playstation. While I don't dispute that the graphics on this game are like nothing I've ever seen, it means nothing without the game play to back it up. The day that 989 releases Faceoff for the PS2, I'll be the first in line to trade in my EA NHL 2001."
2,This doesnt measure up. Dont believe the Commercials...,"I now have a PS2 and a dreamcast. I have NHL 2k for the dreamcast and there is no comparison between it and this game...The dreamcast wins hands down. The gameplay on this is riduculous compared to the dreamcast NHL 2K. The graphics during play are also much better for the dreamcast game.Very simply the intro graphics for the this game are unbelievable. But when you actually play the game the graphics are not up to par. The game play is bad: no one timers, no shooting while skating, it has a bad feel etc. I dont know about everyone else, but I really could care less about intros...I want good graphics during game play.The same goes for Madden football. Its just not as good as NFL 2K for the dreamcast. Basically, EA sports just cant compare with Sega sports games.If you are considering buying the dreamcast vs. the PS2 for sporting games, then take my word for it you want the dreamcast!"
3,As good as NHL 2000?,"I only played the game for about 30 minutes, but I found it to be not as good as NHL 2000. Of course I did play NHL 2000 on PC, so maybe that is the difference. I find the gameplay for NHL 2001 PS2, to be worse, but the animations and player shots (such as when someone gets sent to the penalty box) to be better. The skating control is much too arcade-like. For instance, when the player is skating down ice, and you press to the right, he makes an instant 90 degree turn. Perhaps I am missing something, but I find this game to be sub-par to NHL 2000 (again, mind you, I am comparing PS2 to PC)."
1,This game is for loosers,"WOW! How bad can a game get? I got a PS2, and I love the system, but the games are aweful. Not only that, the graphics are like Wolfenstein! Get this game if you really, really liked MDK2, but I definitely wouldn't suggest it. What a waste of 50 cents. DON'T get! DONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!"
4,ryans opinion,"I thought this was the best hockey playwise nhl.i havent played 2002,but play wise it is much more like the real nhl! especially the saves the goalies make,they literally steal the game or leave it tied at times! the defense is much more like real nhl,but 03',and 04' did have better graphics thats why i give it 4 stars! i highly recommend it!"
5,SWEET!!,NHL 2001 kicks. This has to be the best hockey game ever. The graphics are awsome and the gameplay is very realistic and very very addictive. The sound effects are also sweet and the videocuts are pretty cool. The fights are all right and very easy to get into as long as you slam your apponent into the ice after the whistle blows. The other team gets mad easily which makes picking fights very easy. The controls aren't confusing and the quick actions of the players also make the game very xciting. I highly recommend purchasing this kick ... game for your PS2. You won't regret it!
3,good game but.......,"i would wait and see what faceoff is like. graphically, nhl 2001 is great, but the pregame and in-game ""puff"" pieces get tired after a while. the gameplay is choppy due to slowdown, which occurs when there are several players in the same end of the ice. also, its tough to find a good camera angle, they are either too close, which makes it diffiuclt to set up 1 timers or its too far away, which makes the guys look like midgets.on the plus side, this game has tons of options to keep you busy & its just plain fun to play. the AI is very very good on the all-star level.the 2 questions i have for EA Sports is, how can u make a game with slowdown on a 128 bit system and why cant you make hockey games like the old NHL series for the sega genesis?"
3,NHL 2001: The coolest version of a lame series,"I admit my bias up front: I've owned and played every version of NHL FaceOff since it was released for PlayStation. And I like it a lot.I've bought 3 versions of EA's NHL over the years, and in my opinion, they've never played as well as FaceOff. NHL 2001 for PS2 has the coolest graphics . . . it makes FaceOff 2001 for PS1 look old and tired, but . . . the gameplay just doesn't feel realistic. I typically play with a wide overhead view of the ice, so I don't see a lot of the awesome graphics as I play. What I see is how players skate and how the play develops. I don't play hockey to watch the cool things that happen during the breaks, I play for the action, the strategy and scoring.As pretty as NHL 2001/PS2 is, I'll stick with Faceoff 2001/PS1 and wait for FaceOff's PS2 offering."
3,Gameplay [is poor],"EA sports really [messed] this one up. I am a long time NHL player and have just about every years previous title for the playstation, so believe this review. The graphics on this game are outstanding, some of the best I've seen for PS2. However the gamplay is horrible. You know how you can come in and put a quick move on the goalies in the playstation version??? One on one with the goalie in this game is reminisant on ""Blades of Steel"" where your only shot is a slapshot into the goalies pads. You will also note that when a player takes a slapshot, he stops in his tracks on the ice to wind up. You mean players can't take a shot while skating??? Come on EA, you need to concentrate a little more on gameplay next time."
1,One flaw and this game got brought down,At first i was playing thise game and i thought this is the 2nd best hockey game i ever played (nhl 2k1 still #1) Then I relived the HUGE flaw. The thing was if you just get the put at the center of the rink and tap shot it goes in just about every time. Like 9 out of 10 times it will go in
2,Slow down makes a difference,"The frame rate problem in this game really made it impossible for me to enjoy it. I HIGHLY recommend you rent this before purchasing, especially now that 2002 is almost out.Fortunately games like GT3 and Madden keep me hopeful that NHL 2002 will rock - it'd better, otherwise this long-time EA fan (ever since the glory days of Sega hockey) will have to try a different NHL title."
1,Terrible,"I thought this was going to be the be all end all of the NHL series, but I was totally wrong. The slowdown in this game is unbearable and the gameplay isn't that great either."
3,Nice faces and skating action.,"Its a fun hockey game, and definately worth owning, there are some annoying parts:1) Camera is occaisionally too close which cuts out view of teamates. This makes assisting difficult.2) Play slowdown when the benches are in view.3) Computer teamates aren't very predictable, making it hard to set up shots in one player mode.4) Fighting looks like the Benny Hill Show, the punches move super fast and are jerky.5) Checking animation could be better."
5,Amazing Space,"This album is as beautiful as it is haunting and mysterious. Though much closer to a Harold Budd album than anything Andy Partridge has ever done, after repeated listenings, Andy's fingerprints are clearly evident.Whether you are enjoying this as background/ambient music or are actively listening to it, it is equally applicable.The album evokes dark imagery and the space isn't always comfortable, but it is always fascinating.I give it my highest recommendation."
4,"Wow, I'm surprised how well it works!","I live in Los Angeles; there's either a Mexican or Jazz station on every frequency! I tried the cassette-MP3 adapter (which I'd prefer if I didn't have that dreaded auto-reverse feature) and had to return it.While this product only has 4 channels, they each worked for me with varying success. It's not CD quality, which is obvious when I play my classical music and when my son rocks out to songs with deep bass.If you're ok with decent sound quality and can't use the cassette adapter, I'd say this product should work great for you."
2,not so good,"This does not work as well as I had hoped. There are 4 choices of stations that it can broadcast to, and it never comes in clearly on any of them. I am constanly having to change the station on it and on the radio while driving as other real stations intrude on the signal. It just is not what I was hoping for."
2,Not for me,I live in a city (Providence) and couldn't pick up the transmission without a good deal of static. I gave up on this transmitter and instead bought a Belkin tape thingie that inserts in my tape deck and connects to my MP3 player. The Belkin product works fine.
4,Great.-,Is a great and nice watch for the price. I recomend for people who find a nice watch for low price. In the future i'll buy another Nautica watch. Fast delivery in great conditions.-
4,Flawed Item,"We were very happy with the condition and style of the watch, but when we received it, we noticed the seconds on the outer ring of the band (the ""05, 15, 25...55) were in the wrong places. To the right of where noon is, it started with 55 and we were not able to turn the dial to correct it. I'm guessing this is just a flawed item and we are considering returning it to a Nautica manufacturer here. Otherwise, the watch was in great condition."
5,awesome watch at great price!!!,Elegant watch at great price...perfect as a gift..I ordered it for my uncle and was not sure about the quality but guess what !!!! everyone loved it..so I ordered it again in different colour.
2,GOOD LOOKING IMPOSSIBLE TO READ,"The analog functions of day & date are impossible to read. Much to small. The metal band although attractive requires, I believe, a jeweler's expertise to adjust. I ended up giving the watch away and buying a Timex digital that although not as attractive as the Nautica I can easily dertermine the time, day & date."
3,Nautica's N10061,"It is a nice watch, the center links and the bezel were too shiny for my taste. I talked with a jeweler about dimming it down by brushing the metal and that was not a good option, so I returned it. Otherwise the dial and the rest of the watch was really nice."
5,I really like this watch,"I needed a new watch and didn't want to break the bank. This is the perfect everyday watch for wearing to work and casually. The date, day and military time part are for decoration since I have 55 yr old eyes and would need reading glasses to actually see what they say. None the less, I think it makes the watch look more elegant. I like the blue face and the silver band that fits with any and everything I wear. I highly recommend this watch - great deal for me."
1,Don't waste your money!,"You may be tempted by the gorgeous gold cross on the cover, only to study the book for hours without finding it. That's from one of Malinda Johnston's wonderful books, but Ms. Wilson doesn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge that. That's a perfect example of what this book is like ... Yuck! There are some absolutely awesome quilling books available nowadays (and most, if not all, are right here on Amazon). Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Never received product or refund,I ordered and paid for The Craft of Quilling on December 6 and I have not received the book or a refund. I sent an e-mail to the seller and still have not had a response. I will not be doing business with anyone on Amazon again.
5,Terrific,I run relaxation groups. I have utilized this video toteach meditation. Groups members love Dr. Kornfield andtruly learn from him.I have been meditating for many years and find that Ihave learned new techniques from Dr. Kornfield. He hasmade my job much easier
5,Doughboys,Excellent content not readily available elsewhere. Lots of detail on printed pages inside the CD but in tiny print since it was condensed (apparently) from vinyl size pages.
4,Homecourt Advantage,"I found Homecourt Advantage by Ewing a delightful piece of fiction. I read numerous books and I especially like to read ones written by Black authors. Many of these books contain similarities to real life situations that I have or my friends or family have experienced. Sometimes though these books overlap themselves in their storylines.I did not find this to be the case with Homecourt Advantage though. I had one personal acquaintance with someone who played professional football and thus was privy to some of the back ground drama that goes on.I think Homecourt Advantage told an entertaining, fictional story of the life and times of a team of professional basketball players mainly from the wives and girlfriends perspective. I found it to be a welcome change from some of the run-of-the-mill publications that are on the shelves."
3,It's a puzzler!,"I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk! :)"
1,bad idea.,I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long.
3,Other Opinion,"I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us."
1,Tarnish Crap!,"I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!!"
3,Be careful about sizing,"This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger."
1,waste of money,"I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back."
1,Awful ring..,"Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products."
3,"pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions","The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal."
3,a puzzler!,"I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought ""Well, I wonder how it comes apart.""BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose)"
3,Watch out for sensitive skin,I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring.
2,HELLLPPPPPP,"Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP!"
4,Very Pleasant,"This is not great music, nor a great performance, but it is pleasant as well as being interesting to hear what successful 18th century comic opera was like. The performance is brisk and amusing, and the whole thing comes off very successfully. While not as striking as the Secret Marriage, it is in the same league, and I find it as enjoyable as most second-rank opera."
4,Making History Interesting For Kids.,"Until the movie AMISTAD was released five years ago, most Americans had never heard of the famed slave ship that caused such a ruckus and illustrated to the world how fractured the United States was on the issue of slavery. Taking it's cue from the movie, this book had it's named changed from THE LONG BLACK SCHOONER to THE STORY OF THE AMISTAD.The book tells the story surrounding the Amistad. However, it is told in a way that is appealing to both youth and adults. The language is simple and the story is straightforward. There is no historical gobbly-gook here.I found the book to be rather interesting, quite informative, and fairly easy to read (I read it in less than two days). It makes a great gift for any young history buff or anyone who is interesting in learning more about the Amistad but who hasn't studied much history."
2,Got comparison?,"Readers seem to rate a text for its mere appearance/publication or its importance within the larger framework of Buddhist texts, than for the quality of its translation. Now, how many people have actually compared the original to the translation? Few, I guess. Yet most of the readers give a high rating. I find that unplausible.Even without mastering (Classical) Chinese (from which this translation is done), someone with some experience in Buddhist rhetoric will find some things to remark:* Classical Chinese lends itself to different interpretations, leaving a certain arbitrariness in translation (in syntax).* Words like 'the Law' and 'the Laws' or 'Dharma' need contextual interpretation. I don't doubt Watson is a good translator, but I wished some notes were included where ambiguity of terms exists.* Leaving passages or whole chapters out is a pity. For a complete published edition leaves the reader to choose which chapters to skip."
4,Super....But,"Everything was fine, except that all the plastic CD holders had demounted from the folder. Not great for storage, as they all fall out each time you open, unless you happen to remember. The CD's and book were in perfect shape."
1,Very disappointing,"My husband shelled out over $100 for this dreck to give me as a Christmas gift. What a waste of money! I could barely listen to the first three disks, the quality was SO poor. The songs are obscure, recorded in mono, scratchy - horrid. I've never even bothered to play the rest. This very expensive dust catcher is now sitting on a shelf until I can justify throwing it away. My advice? Don't waste your money. Get a CD of the Capitol Years - much, much better."
2,Did not live up to expectations,No where near as sharp as a straight razor should be... pretty dissapointed. But very good customer service.
3,Good after awhile,"This is the first straight razor I purchased, after some sharpening a good strop and a long time learning it has been great!"
3,good for the price,"the handle is cheap and the blade is dull. Have to sharpen the blade with the stone, but other than that its a razor for shaving."
4,Good sample of Cubans of renown.,"This bilingual work offers to the Spanish or English reader the accomplishments of a selected group of Cuba's best, from the 19th-century ""Fathers of the Country"" -one of them a top literary figure- to a 20th-century Chess World Champion. Also includes a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Medicine and a world-renown composer, among others. Very well documented, featuring little-known biographical data. Easy reading, very enjoyable. One is left with a crave for more."
4,"Not bad, but not the best","This is a good figure, but the weakest of the 6 Energon figures I've gotten so far. I don't care much for the robot mode, especially the head. Perhaps if it had darker colors. The transformation is a simplified version of the standard Cheetor/catbot method, and while the figure carries it off reasonably, it would be improved without the geared movement of the heads into position. The cat mode is excellent - it stands well, looks good, and the weapons add to its appearance. Its posability is hampered somewhat by the geared transformation - I frequently try to move his arm (or foreleg depending on mode) and end up having to put his head back into place. This will probably loosen up with play, though. It's a good toy for the price, and a good army builder figure. If you're just looking for something to fiddle with, though, I'd recommend Skyblast before this guy."
2,Not great but worth it for the video,"This is not a great single, the bsides are not great.The instrumental of Sound of Sounds is just what it says.Click Click is a throwaway song unless you like gomez doing country.The only saving grace is the video for Ping One Down, cool animations and very fitting of the music.Neither of the bsides made it onto Five Men in a Hut, but neither really deserve to make room on it for the other great bsides out there."
5,Rothmans Football Yearbook 2002-2003,"According to most football enthusiasts, this is THE book to own regarding the beautiful game -- soccer! It contains extensive coverage of all players, records, and competitions, especially within the English and Scottish leagues. This is a must for any football fan.And, if you look on ebay or other used booksellers, it seems the demand for these books only increases as time passes! Get one while you can (ps, they should be paying me for this vibrant sales pitch!)"
4,I am Rich Look,"Here's the deal. I started this debut album over 5 years ago in New York, recording 11 if its 13 tracks under the masterful direction of veteran record producer John Simon (The Band, Janis Joplin, etc.) and the able assistance of associate producer Manny Moreira.I finished it this past summer (1999) in New Orleans with 2 tracks including the title song.It is the first of 3 CD's I plan to record of the best songs I have written over the past 25 years with Kash Monet and Cathy Chamberlain plus new songs as I write them. The album is quite wide-ranging in styles and entrancing to listen to, featuring the playing of some of the top musicians in New York and New Orleans.Offbeat Magazine likes its ""funny songs"", characterising me as ""a kinder, gentler Randy Newman"" (I accept the compliment.) I would give this album 5 stars except it has one song entirely in Japanese (Elvis! ) and that just isn't fair."
4,Just as described,"I have owned this for over a year. It does not experience heavy use (it is a side table in my office), but it continues to sit there, holding my plants, just as a shelf should. Assembly was a breeze."
3,Fine Product,"It's a nice corner table. The vertical pieces are metal tubes, and the shelves are laminate covered particle board (typical). The decorative feet are disappointing (plastic), but they seem to work fine. Overall a fine product for the money (it's made in Taiwan). Note that the dimensions provided in the description are WRONG. This is a 12"" x 12"" corner table, 30"" high. It is not 12""x17"", which is really what I wanted."
5,Good CD Case,I wasn't expecting much more than a large CD holder and that's pretty much what this is. It holds all my CDs and has room for more(for now) and fits nicely under the passenger seat in my Cavalier.A nice bonus I found was a static free cleaning cloth that is attached to the inside for easy access and cleaning of dirty discs. After living in Phoenix for a year it handled the heat well with no real damage other than a few CDs being form-fitted to the plastic holder. And after a winter in Michigan it seems to have endured the cold without any damage at all. So that tells me that it is made out of quality materials.The handle on the top of the case is a nice touch and makes it easy to transport from one place to another. I didn't really know what to expect when purchasing a CD album like this but I am very happy to have made this purchase and I would be happy to buy from this maker again.
5,Looking for the special card,This magazine comes with one of 2 different cards for the RAGE CCG. Scrouging thw Wyrm or Pumpkinman. You may have to buy several to get bpoth cards as they were not released in equal quanities.
2,It broke.,"While this thing was working, I lenjoyed it. For what it was anyway. It's good for background music at work or workout. It's slow to start and respond, all problems other reviews stated, but lightweight and I think shaped very well with clip and all.The problem is that I started it up one day and had progressively worse errors till now when it only displays the logo and the lights stay on permanently. I'd buy another one for work (where it might get broke) if I can find it for cheap enough."
1,Didn't live up to my expectations,"After receiving the RCA Lyra, I began to use it only to find out that it would freeze up and the only way to unfreeze it was to take the battery out and start it up again. Well after two more times I had enough and I am still waiting on my refund!"
5,Skillet,I just love the size of this pan! It is perfect for one or two people. I use it all the time.
2,bad external design,The inner surface of the pan is fine so far. The external surface stains easily and is difficult to clean. The handles also get hot. I rarely use the pan because of its poor design.
3,Use this one often but I question the quality,"Use this pan the most. Nice size for a main dish that serves four. No oil necessary when sauteing. Minus two stars because most of my Calphalon inherently gets weird, colorful discolorations, almost like burnt spots on the inside bottom. I take excellent care of my pans when cooking and cleaning, but I think they cannot hold up to the heat. The outer surface nicks easiy if one pan nudges another, for instance when placed next to another pan in the dish drain or placed into another for storing. Calphalon does not have NSF certification-- even Costco's cookware has that, and their cookware looks and feels identical to Calphalon."
4,Great pan.. a little small,"This is a really good pan for the money. It's easy to tell that the non-stick coating is of a superior quality. I have used it to make spongy omelets and can broil them in the oven with cheese on top for a wonderful top layer. It spreads heat evenly and the glass lid is great to see your food without opening it.The only problem I have with it is that it's smaller than I thought it would be, even just cooking for two. I have the hard anodized 12-inch Calphalon that I'm equally happy with and it is considerably bigger, and a little taller. I still use both, but I would use this one more if not for the size. Overall, happy with the product."
4,"good, reliable camera",A very good camera. My previous one was the same. But unfortunately it is not water proof and on our visit to Niagara got wet and broke. I am buying this again. The lens cover is very useful. Very handy and takes great pictures.
2,Red eye PRODUCTION,"We bought this to snap photos around the house of our little girl. We couldn't have been more disappointed. The shots come out fuzzy and the red eye reduction DOESN'T work. After several attempts to contact Pentax through their customer service website they suggested a number of techniques, none of which worked. It doesn't matter what speed film you use, get this camera indoors and you'll be disappointed. In all fairness, the outside photos look OK, took a bunch of shots of European sites and have an occasional fuzzy long distance photo, but mostly accurate."
1,Overated BTU's,"We attempted to use this unit to cool a small computer room.(10x10x8 insulated)Without any cooling the room would get to about 85 degrees. With the unit set to 68 degrees the best it can do is take the temp down to 77 degrees. Some may say we are expecting too much from this unit but I owned a 12,000 btu window unit for my home and I can tell you this unit does not put out any where near the same amount of cold air. I can guarantee my old window unit would keep this little room cool(cold). From what I have read it appears all of these portable units are way overated for their BTU's. I would estimate the output as being 50% of what they are advertising. The two duct design is a great idea but the exhaust duct creates a tremendous amount of radiant heat to the point of being counter-productive to the cool air being produced."
4,Suprisingly good book,"I enjoyed reading it. Not 100% sure it was totally true but who cares, it was well written and hard to put down."
2,True? Tripe!,"Well, the Lady was an ugly beeatchzilla with a perpetual case of pms. This book scared the hell out of me when I was 17. As I have grown up, I look back and see that it was at best scary fiction, and not particuarly well-written. Its premise was unbelievably stupid. And - wooooo - isn't the year 2000, by which we were all supposed to know about these ""beings"" and be quaking in our boots, past?Read it - and laugh at it - as a scary story and nothing more."
3,Does not have plugs,"This product only contains one plug (for the sphere). The other lids all have holes in them. The seller shipped us a new one when we inquired, but it had the same problem. They also told us that plugs are not available separately so if you really want it to hold liquid with minimal spill risk, this is not the product for you. It is probably fine for most people's purposes. The main problem is with the cone and other shapes where the base is the only place they can rest but the hole is in the base. You have to hold it upside down until it is emptied. Basically, it's a poorly thought out product. How hard would it be to include plugs for all the shapes???"
3,OK Solids,"This work excited my kids and provided many types of games and learning activities. The problem was my piece did not arrive with all the items caps, and the caps are difficult to put on and keep on."
3,great album but leaves you wanting more,ive been a fan of genitorturers for awhile all their albums have been great over the years along with this one but it leaves you wanting more only because it has three new songs and the rest are live songs from previousalbums which are good i would give it a three
1,GOD AWFUL CRAP!,I don't knwo how anyone cna give this cd a 5 star rating. This girl sound like a tone deaf cat in heat! She is horrible! Don't waist your money! This cd has so many background voclas and poopy crap you can't even hear her awful voice! Its terrible you shouldn't even be on this page! Leave now! Forget about this pop trash!
2,ehh...,"""yes"" is an awesome song, i fell in love with it at the movie theater, but the rest of the album is pretty uneven. the singing is pretty terrible on some songs, and the music in the background is always worse. i do think there is potential here, i hope she practices a little and her parents' songwriting improves and they continue to record."
5,The Perfect Book To Touch A Heart,"I recently had the pleasure of reading ""A Very Special Child"", written by Debra Shiveley Welch. This book is a story that explains in very simple and heart wrenchingly beautiful terms, how much her child means to her life even though she did not have the privilege of carrying him herself.If you have ever known how good it feels to have a child's arms around your neck, this book is for you. If you have ever wondered what a child can bring into your life, or someone else's life, this book is for you. In fact, I cannot imagine anyone who would not enjoy this book. I can guarantee you a warm and fuzzy feeling in your heart by the time you close the cover."
4,Asgard the planet of the gods is under rated,"In the beginning for the first few chapters of the book the author details too much about the Asgard planet. But, after that its a great story, great inter-planetary battle scenes in the last ragnarok. A more explicit understanding of correctly translated words gives some credibility to the story."
3,"Fun, action-adventure book","I chose this book because I read the back of the book and I like action-adventure books, and this book was one. I thought this book would be an action-packed book and I got more than that which was great! I loved reading this book, except I didn't know that it was part of a trilogy! I also loved the fact that it takes place in modern times. This story is about a boy named Charlie who can talk to cats! The story begins when his parents are kidnapped and he goes in search of them. With the aid of numerous animals from stray city cats to lions in a floating circus, he slowly reveals his parents' dissappearance. At the same time, he is being chased by a mysterious boy named Rafi. The author is Zizou Corder and the type of book is fiction. I liked this book because I like action-adventure books and I also like sequels. I had to get hold of the next two books. I think this book appeals to children from the ages of 10-12 years old. [...]"

4,A lovely book,"This is a delightful story about a young boy on a quest to rescue his parents. He can talk to all species of cats and uses this ability on his journey. He helps and is helped by a group of lions. I enjoyed reading this novel. It is short and just took an afternoon. I was dissapointed that the ending was ""to be continued..."" because there is no sequel yet available. If things weren't left hanging I might not feel so cheated at the end. I would recomend this book for children but you might want to wait for the next book to be published before starting this one."
4,"cats are heros all over the planet, at least for Charlie Ashanti",Go into the future with your mind and imagine this.................A boy by the name of Charlie. Who's parents are scientists. But when he comes home to find a note saying that his parents are on a business trip. and when the biggest bully in his school comes to pick him to take him some where (unknown to him.) and he is locked up an told to keep quet. After running away to help his parents a cat tells him that they are headed to Venice and that the only ship headed that way belongs to a circus. and when to the lions on the ship that he wil bring them home to africa. and...... READ THE BOOK.'cause i'm not telling.
3,"A great adventure story! Although, some flaws!","Let me start off, no book is ever perfect. This book was a great adventure story! Charlie Ashanti is a truly believable character and the cats and people he encounters are truly rememborable. But, there are some flaws in some parts. A) It seems to be poorly written during some parts of the book. No don't get me wrong, the story and the plot are very creative and orgional (I won't give to much away), but, it seems that some sentences were written by the young child rather than the mother's more mature style of writing. B) Sometimes the dialogue seems a bit rough and childish between the villan, R.S., and not really villiany (don't know if that's a word?) at all. Although, I'm currently reading the second adventure in the series and it seems like a huge step up from the first; written better, more epic descriptions and memorable characters. All I can say about this rising series is watch out Harry Potter!"
5,An inventive new world and exciting story,"A world where cars have been banned for all but the most powerful and rich because of concerns over asthma, and featuring a boy who can speak to cats, this is an inventive book that marches to the beat of its own drummer. Charlie knows that his parents do important work, but never imagines that anyone would want to harm them, until he comes home one day and discovers them kidnapped. Charlie runs away from his parents kidnappers and sets out to find his parents. With major parts of the book taking place on a floating circus, the streets of Paris, and aboard a train, the book has numerous delightful subplots while never losing focus of Charlie's overall goal. The book ends somewhat abruptly and will lead many readers to wait somewhat impatiently for the next book."
3,"Great in places, ho-hum in others","Although LionBoy has the standard ""parents are missing and in peril"" basic story, it also has a believable central character with a great secret ability. The environmental and anti-big company stuff is a little preachy for my taste, the parents are too saintly and some of it is based on bad science though. When it's just trying to be an adventure story it's fun and exciting. It certainly makes a chnage from the magic and Middle Earth derivatives we're bombarded with."
3,A pretty exciting book,I thought that it was an okay book. It had some exciting parts to it but also had some boring.
2,LionBoy needs a bit more 'spunk',"Two other students and I read the book LionBoy, by Zizou Corder. We thought that this book needed to have more description, action and explanation. There are many questions left at the end of this book.This book starts off when Charlie Ashanti, the main character, comes home to find his parents have dissappeared. Following a mysterious note, Charlie sets out on an adventure. We thought that this book needed more spunk, and it needed to be more understandable for kids. M.F., G.G., N.V."
2,"Functional, but lacking a reason to buy it.","I bought this modem, along with about eight other USB modems, when running a test at work. While the Zoom was functional I was pretty unimpressed with it. All of the other larger modems I tried had status lights on them. This isn't mandatory for most applications, but occasionally it is nice to have.Basically, this modem just has nothing extra going for it. It's four times the size of the small form-factor modems, and doesn't have the features of some of the other options in this size. My preference would be either the USRobotics modem for the best driver support or any number of much cheaper options (you can get a USB modem for $10-15) that will work fine."
3,A typical black box,"I needed to send faxes from the Aspire One, so I bought this modem at the local Microcenter. It was on sale for $9. Fax connection never goes faster than 7200 bps. On the same line USR Courier V.Everything easily does 14400. Oh, well, what do you want for nine bucks?..The only annoying thing about this modem is the lack of any lights on the case. Image is correct, there are 4 ""indicators"" that look just like normal LEDs for status lights like TR, CD etc. But they never lit up, so I suppose that they are strictly decorative."
4,Good updated machine...,"Earlier this year I was given my first machine...a 35 yr old Viking. I works great but recently broke one of it's belts. Needlesstosay it was going to take a week to get a new one, and being in the middle of a project, I needed something quickly. I picked up this model by Brother. It will take some getting used to compared to the 35 yr old one but, once I get the hang of it I think it will be a great addition. Super light weight, (especially compared to the 40lb older one), and easy to use, great easy to follow instructions, and awsome additional stitches I am excited to use it more. My only negative though is using it for what I do, embelishing jeans and overalls for my kids and friends kids, the thickness of the sewing stage makes this difficult. It seems about 1-2"" thicker than the Viking. I may, for these projects, have to use the old one."
1,Worked for one project,It is built cheap. Not sturdy enough for 1 project a year. After it stopped working the repair shop said it was easier/cheaper to just buy a new one. We bought a non computerized machine that was built sturdier.
2,Had better machine,I've done about 5 hours sewing on this machine and now it comes up with a F2 fault code and the machine won't work. According to the manual I have to contact the Brother service department....I've also never encounted such problems with the cotton getting tangled around the top spool nor had the needle unthread it self. I know this can be handled by pulling enough thread through but I've done alot of sewing over the years and never had this problem. Still I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Not built to last.,It was great when it was new but stopped working after 2 years. This machine has computer functions with codes. If you get an 'F' code you have a choice of either bringing it to a dealer or it's junk. If you decide to bring it to an authorized repairer the cost is $114 just to look at it. If you need routine maintenance such as oiling you also need to bring it to a dealer. I wouldn't buy another Brother sewing machine. It's a great machine but it just didn't last.
2,2 1/2 stars,"Unwritten Industry Rule #3: When Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis stop writing and producing for you, you're toast. That's what happened with Solo, who were the best guy group this side of Boyz II Men (back in 1995, anyway). This album is free of the classic soul songs that made their self-titled debut a treat, and are replaced with proven-formula tracks of hip-hop/R&B; it even contains a guest rapper on one of the songs. The only saving graces are ""Forgive Me"", ""Make Me Know It"", and their still-amazing vocals. This album gets the thumbs-down."
2,Solo - 4 Bruthas and a Bass,"Their first album, self-titled, was rich in production, harmonies, etc.--they were the total package. So what the heck happened here? Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis left them so they started to falter and, unfortunately, tried to crossover. There's a Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony-type ballad called ""Luv-All-Day"" that features Kieaun Da Golden Child speed-rapping. That song alone is just embarrassing. And they stayed away from such old-soul production from their debut in favor for some more urban, radio-friendly tunes. The ballad that should have been the best song, ""Till Death Do Us Part"" featuring Brownstone (the best R&B girl and guy groups on the same song) falters because while the ballad-y production works for Brownstone, it sounds too crossover for Solo. They still impress with their acapella interludes and with the songs, ""Forgive Me"" and the Gerald Levert-penned ""Make Me Know It"", but those aren't enough to save the album."
2,After the last gritty albulm ... dissapointing,"This albulm is far too similar to all the other r&b albulms out there. Repetitive & Tedious. After the last albulm, the long wait for this albulm has been a let down"
5,SOLO,"Without doubt, THE best album I have!Absolute quailty, felt with the heart.The lyrics are amazing. An album for all moods.I'd recommend to anyone.Just a shame you can't get hold of it in the UK!"
3,4 Bruthas and A Bass...Minus Jam & Lewis,"Solo has unquestionable talent but they epitomize the sophomore jinx most artists experience. Gone is the production team of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. And with them is the departure of the real Solo sound. Sure, the vocals are still amongst the best around, but the lyrics and music leave a lot to be desired. These guys have what it takes but they'll have a lot of work ahead of them to recapture the fan base they began building with their first album."
4,Solo has done it again,Solo 4 bruthas and a bass is one of the best rb albums out folks don't go by the record sales or bill board awards. The quartet have harmonies that remind you of Sam Cooke and Otis Reddings and musically and lyrically the album is more potent than the last one
1,Broken on opening,"I ordered one that was ""like new"" condition, when it showed up the shelves were broken and the bottom was falling apart. All the pieces were the cheapest plastic you could get, the pieces for the moncala set alone were so small that any child would lose them. With half of the entire game set broken for ""like new condition"" I am going to return this product before even seeing how the pieces work with game play. One of the other reviews mention that the Chinese checker pieces wont stay in the grooves and that the chess pieces fall over due to their light weight plastic make, so ill assume that my set would have been the same since its all made the same."
2,10 game house - poor quality,"I thought for the price the wood would be of better quality than it was. Some of the sliders that have the boards internally came broken.. I had to glue them together. The materials used look so cheap, the coins for the games mediocre. They had literally stuck a sheet of plastic over the wood for the game boards. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."
5,Another notch on the book belt,"If you're going on the run, be sure to take someone like Jedidiah Brown with you. In this sequel to Debra Mullins's DONOVAN'S BED, beautiful Susannah Calhoun is accused of murder. None other than Jed Brown, a man from her past and with whom she has unfinished business, comes to escort her to her trial in Denver. Along the way we have enough sparks flying to rival a July 4th celebration, not to mention the bad guys on their trail and bent on revenge. This is fun in the old West. Debra Mullins proves once again with THE LAWMAN'S SURRENDER that she is a writer who delivers. This, her third book and second outing into the west, has all the punch of a Shoot Out at the O.K. Corral. If you want good fun, a great hero, and a damsel in distress, don't miss this one. I promise you'll be delighted."
3,Decent read,"I really like this author, but this was not her best book. I had high hopes, but was not thrilled with this one."
5,The book of advice I would give to a couple,"I have been fortunate to be married to a wonderful woman for more than 30 years. We have been through a lot in that time: raising four children, moving countries three times, changing careers, financial worries, and much more. I believe there are simple but essential elements to a great relationship. This book, of all books I have seen on the subject of relationships, is simple and sensible and it works. Forget the tricks and fads. Get a copy of this, and read a verse each morning and evening, together, and see what happens. I can vouch for it personally."
3,Genetics,"This book takes a while to get to the point and has a tendency to repeat itself. Aside from all the digressions and redundancy, not a bad read."
5,Modern Genetics Book,The processing of the order was very fast and the product was in excellent condition. Thank you!
2,bad,"The book itself was in a fair condition, lot of writing in the book and the cover was terrible, covered with duct tape!!!!!!!"
3,CD Case with built-in speaker,Sound quality is good. Very low price. But... Monophonic only. CD player takes up much of interior space. No tone controls. Short hook-up cord. CD player inaccessible when closed. Not weatherproof. No carrying strap (has snap hook for belt). Relatively bulky and heavy. Lacks auto power-off for speaker. Case is somewhat rigid.
5,Really liked this speaker.,"I purchased to use at the beach and was pleasantly surprised- sounds good and was loud enough to hear throughout the kitchen and living rooms. I think it will work at the ocean- with waves and wind, it will probably get drowned out but should be fine sitting next to. It looks like it it is sand-proof and water resistant. So, if you need something to protect your mp3 and stow batteries, cash... this is it! I cut the sleeves out for cd's to make more room. Runs on 2 AA's. Seller shipped very quickly and what a steal! Thanks, Ritz!"
4,Glad the author took the time to write this....,I feel that important points are made by the author. The sources are not all mainstream accepted texts but it seems that he groups and qualifies the sources so the reader can add his/her own 'pinch of salt' where needed. It will be an important reference for me for some time to come.
4,Beware of Shipping ripoff,The price is right for this unit and it's no bigger than a box of matches but the vendor charges $US75 just to ship it to Australia!
3,"Good, not great","Small remote, about the size of a portable flash drive. Works well within 10-12 feet. Outside, you must be closer in my experience due to IR interference. For what I paid ($8.00 including shipping) I would but it again."
4,Why Words on Paper Still Matter,"Inspiring for both the reader and the writer in us all. Reading the passionate words of our contemporaries about the road to writing (amongst other things) in this multimedia landscape had the potential to feel as if one was watching wizened literary giants look down from the mountaintop and cast judgmental glares down on us, the lazy reader. ""Bookmark Now"" doesn't do that. There is no rarefied air here. This is like having a beer or a coffee and cigarettes with some college friends and a lively conversation about life, love and literature (or secrets, sex and sentences if you prefer) breaks out. Recommended to anyone who needs to be reminded why reading is fun and writing is sometimes divine."
3,"Writers dish on writing - good job, Kevin!","This book is a book that Kevin Smokler compiled and edited of articles by authors about writitng. The book ranges from very good to not very good, no fault to Kevin's. He tried to put together a great book. The concept was there, and most of the writing was, too. A few of the essays just fell flat, that's all. However, most of the stories were good, and I would recommend this book to be read by friends. Essays such as Tara Bray Smith's ""Marginalia and Other Crimes"", Tracy Chevelalier's ""Lying to the Optician: The Reading Experience Rated"", and Meghan Daum's ""If I Had a Stammer"" are top notch. A couple of essays leave you scratching your head. Hey, but look at it this way. It is a book of essays - you can skip to the next one if the one you are reading does not float your boat. Good job, Kevin.Cam"
1,bad,"we had to watch for almost 2 periods. not interesting at all. sry to any teachers reading this. but, if you want ur class to talk, give tehm this. we didnt even pay attention much."
1,Allied Asault & Pacific,"This game did not work at all. When we tried to call for help, we could not ever get through. We were put on hold and never were able to talk to anyone. It crashes as soon as the game starts. We did finally receive an email to say ""it must be the computer"". All the other games on the collection of games worked. This was the only one that did not work. I would not have purchased it if I had known one game of four did not work at all."
3,Cheapest way to get 2 MOH titles,"The game pack is good though I'm sure you'd be disappointed with the battlefield titles it brings if you have already played battlefield 2, get yourself battlefield 2. The only worth looking for here are the MOH which I didn't know I'd like more than the battlefields one."
4,A parent's review,"This is the third Alice book I've read, and so far, it's the one I enjoyed the most. Even though it's been a long time since I was fourteen, I really felt Alice's emotions and confusion over the problems with her boyfriend Patrick.As with the other Alice books, there is always some content that parents might want to review before they allow their child to read it. Particularly if their child is younger than 14. However, I thought that this book handled that kind of content well and gave good advice, advice that might indeed be significant to some readers.Alice is becoming more thoughtful in this book and I liked that. It's not only age-appropriate, but also thought-provoking for the readers."
5,I love this book!,"I love all the Alice books. They are one of my favorite series. I get them as soon as my library has a new book in!!!Alice Alone is a great book dealing with lots of new issues and is funny and fun to read as usual! The Alice books always brings some issues up to front that I never knew about (I love this about the books), the humour in the books always, always keeps me laughing!Also, I could relate SO much to Alice! I don't know how Phylis Reynold Naylor can see inside the mind of a teen so well (at least in my opinion), but I love all her books!"
1,Interesting,"I needed to read this book twice through to make sure I wasn't crazy. My conclusion: Save your money. The book seems sort of haphazardly designed with no stand-out meaning in the layouts. The essays although well written didn't really say anything, which really broke this book. The book also seemed pretentious to me, design included. Come down from the clouds and be a normal person, seriously. For what it's worth, the cover sure is ""pretty""."
1,Hind sight is better,"Bought it, read it, wish I didn't spend it. Hoping it would have been one that would have been worthy of my typographic and design library, but it doesn't make the cut. I loaned it to few other designers as well, they reached the same conclusion. If the economy is bad don't buy it, if it's good..up to you."
5,Music with a message,"I purchased this Music for one song ""You have a friend in me"" it was usedin conjunction with Microsoft movie maker at my brothers celebration of life.At the request of my sister in-law. Great song."
3,Sex Pistols - 'Jubilee: The Best Of.....' (EMI) 3 1/2 stars,"Good fourteen track release that would not only be like icing on the cake for the completists, but serve as a good introduction to any new and younger fans out there. Essentials like ""God Save The Queen"", ""Anarchy In The UK"" and my personal Pistols favorite ""Pretty Vacant"" are here with several good cuts that either I haven't heard before or I simply don't remember, like ""Frigging In The Rigging"" and ""C'mon Everybody"". A nice pick."
3,Turning Silver into Gold,"The band has a catalog full of compilations on a variety of labels and this 2002 enhanced release celebrates the ""25th anniversary"" with 14 tracks and a trio of promotional videos.The live version of Pretty Vacant is from the 1996 tour and Silly Thing is the ""single"" version, with Steve Jones handling the lead vocal. The promo videos for Anarchy in the U.K., Pretty Vacant and God Save the Queen make the collection a slight cut above most.The remainder of the songs are avaiable in numerous forms - the official, bootleg and official bootlegs have long-since cleaned out the vault - so it may be the silver mined from the video archive that turns this set into gold."
5,A fun & creative yarn,"Dobbs Dog Detective is a compelling tale of animal investigators, told from the perspective of a veteran FCF Special Agent Dog Detective (Dobbs). It is an imaginative, enjoyable read, appropriate for pet lovers of all ages. I look forward to seeing more of Dobbs and company in future adventures!"
1,WARNING Don't waste your money!,"If I could rate this product any lower I would. The first disk received had damaged/corrupted JPG's, a replacement was sent with the same problem.My biggest grip however is that the majority of images that I was able to view are available for FREE on NASA's image archive site. Also worth noting, there is no organization to the images...it's a mess.This was a complete waste money, don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Sad that this book is still so relevant.,"This is a well researched and well written book. It was written in 2006 ... it could have been yesterday. Although this book is heartbreaking, it is also true and should be read by educators in every state. Perhaps some of this senseless mayhem could be stopped if Lieberman's research reached the right people."
1,Kip Kinkel is an anomoly,"The problem I see with this book is that it makes a sweeping generalization of all school shooters based on one case, Kip Kinkel, who suffers from mental illness. In contrast, other school shootings appear to be the result of bullying and a sense of helplessness by kids that before being bullied appeared to have been fairly normal children. What is pushing these children over the edge that results in the heartbreaking decision to seek retribution by violence? What is happening in our society and what do we do about it?"
1,This is no hunting sim,"There are two modes to this game: ""Arcade"" and ""Hunt"".Arcade was arcadey, but at least you could move. Not much to do with hunting.Hunt mode really sucked. You can't move more than 10 feet in any direction. You just sit there like an idiot, and use your calls. Eventually an animal will come along, and you shoot at it.No tracking, no movement allowed by the player. It's a shame. The graphics engine looks okay, and I was eager to go exploring. Instead, I was confined to a 10-foot circle of invisible walls.Grab the latest ""Hunting Unlimited"" instead.Edit 9-12-10: Since I wrote this review, ""Hunting Unlimited 2011"" has been released, and it is not good. They've switched that series to a new developer, and a completely new engine, which is terrible. So I have to amend the last sentence of my review. It should read, ""Grab 'Hunting Unlimited 2010' instead. Not the 2011 version though""."
1,not impressed,"bought this game for my grandson but he was very disappointed...played once and never played again..graphics were not good and the game was more like a comic impression than an actual hunting game...was too difficult for a child to play with any success, in fact adults found it frustrating to try to play..very disappointed in this product."
1,Only if you are a beginner...with a lot of patience...,"This is an ok book. However, 85% of the models can be found on the internet for free with better diagrams and pictures.The ""better"" models are the modular origamis but the instructions are not very clear and the pictures have funny angles and lights...I figured them out because Ive been folding for a while but if I were just starting, I would've burned this book down.If you were a beginner, it COULD be a good book if it weren't because of the internet, but you can find most models online.I honestly wouldnt recommend it. Unless you have been folding for a while, you are going to get lost and miss steps. And if you have been folding for a while, you will see that only 2 or 3 models are worth your time (which is pretty bad for a whole book)."
4,Another edition of Rick Beech's book,"This is a nice book for beginner folders: it has a nice gallery of origami models and some general information followed by a selection of different types of models. The folds are shown in full-colour photographs rather than standard diagrams - much easier for a first timer to follow, although it's hard to see what's happened in a few pictures.If you want to buy this, do some price-matching first. This book has also been published under such titles as ""Origami Handbook,"" ""Origami : The Complete Practical Guide to the Ancient Art of Paperfolding,"" and as a number of short books that feature single sections of the work eg. Action origami."
2,Are you feeling lucky?,"I needed a remote switch to control a 12v pool light. The first Logisys RM01 Wireless Power Control arrived and failed to operate after I installed it outside. Then I tested it with a 12 power supply on the bench with the switch in line with the power supply (+)and then in line with the neutral (-). There are two ground wires in the unit and I tested with each and then with both attached to a known ground. The tally light on the sending units showed they were transmitting, and the batteries tested AOK. The unit never operated in any configuration. .The seller was gracious and promptly sent a second unit. Despite my high hopes, that too was DOA and failed in every configuration.It seems that there are some units that are AOK and they produce happy customers. I am not among them. I wasted a lot of time and fortunately only a small amount of money. If you feel lucky and want to roll the dice, order one, and good luck!"
1,Not happy to issue a 1-star review but...,"My item arrived DOA and I am initiating a return for refund. I bench-tested the unit with a regulated power supply and known-good ground, and it did not deploy. I used both ground wires individually and then together, to be certain that this was not a factor. I hooked it up per the instructions.My power supply produced 12.36VDC regardless of load in this test (hooked directly to the test bulbs), so I was able to rule that out as well. The end result was this would not switch on either 12v test bulb (tried both incandescent and LED to rule that out as well). I had high hopes for this, but despite the QA label affixed to the back, I suspect they're not batch-checking very many units."
1,Logisys RM01,"This product lasted one week. I purchased two of thse and the first one was DOA, the second lasted a week."
4,D&D Again,"My 8 year old son found all of my old D&D stuff from 25 years ago. He really likes the game so I bought the 3.5 core rule set (I have the original AD&D books which are out of date). Buying the boxed set allows you to save a little money (as opposed to buying the three books individually). There have been a lot of changes to the core rules since I last played. The books are great. They contain lots of information, and they are very organized."
5,Great Beginner Series,"I bought this collection for both my sons when they turned 15. They both enjoy playing D & D with friends and being the Dungeon Master. If you want your kids to learn to play something other than a video game, get this set and sit back and watch them get creative."
5,Good deal on the three core D&D books,"Instead of buying the books separately, you can buy them together in this boxed set. I just wish that it had more freebies than just the box."
5,Nerdy Delight,"Look, if you're in the market for D&D books this bundle is the best thing since fireball for a mage. The box it comes in is durable and cool looking. The books are exactly what you'd expect them to be... if you don't know what they are already there's really now way to describe them."
5,Must have for the avid PnP player...at a great price.,This is a the bare minimum set for any PnP player. The gift set also comes at a great price. Order was shipped extremely quickly and undamaged. Next on my list are the other monster manuals.
2,What?!,"Great redesign and I love the new modules to go with the new d20 system. However, what doesn't make sense to me is the price. Slip cover or no, when you purchase the books individually you save $.06."
1,"Item never received, seller's mistake","The seller was quite nice about it, and prompt - but apparently there was a glitch in their listings and they didn't have the item that we tried to purchase - disappointing"
1,Rating depends on pricing.,"The individual books are great and each deserve 5 stars for content, but the point of a gift set is that there should be some reason to buy it instead of the individual books, and I do not see a convincing reason in this case...."
3,"Great Products, but Poor Service","I ordered this gift set online, and I paid the additional charges for overnight delivery. When I checked the next day, I expected to see that my order was already shipped and on a truck somewhere in my area. Instead, my order was still ""shipping soon"" and the expected delivery date was an additional 4 days! Was I refunded the difference in my shipping charges? No."
4,Great product,"Really good book, readable even if you don't regularly play. Absolutely essential if you DM. I found I had to supplement with on-line stuff, but a really useful book nonetheless"
5,Great Buy,"This set is both cost effective and useful for the average roleplayer. Not feeling the DM job? Lend the DM guide to your DM! Fighting unknown monsters? Check the monster manual! If you want to try D&D out, get this set! You won't regret it!"
2,"Had potential, interesting, yet unlikeable male lead...","This book was entertaining somewhat & found it held my interest, but got tired of never hoping the lead male would get the girl. He was always rude and abrupt to her, had low opinions of her, and laughed at her to be mean, too. Yet she fell in love with him?! They never once had a meaningful conversation. He often left her alone towards the end and she sleeps with him after they start kissing and he sends her away the next day without even letting her talk to him! I quit reading from that point on. I don't like not liking the man in the story and could care less if they ended up together later or not.The author's 1st book in the series, Promise Sunrise was excellent. You don't need to read both, since each is a complete story and the female lead was only 6 years old in that one. This book being as bad as it was, won't stop me from reading the 3rd in the series, Devlin's Promise. I hope it will be better than this one!"
4,This is wonderful story-telling from a Southern viewpoint.,Inman does a wonderful job of telling the story and developing his main characters. A must read for any reader who is nostalgic about their Southern heritage.
3,Not My Favorite,"This novel was a bit too depressing for me. It is a good read, with some very vivid parts, and paints an accurate picture of small-town Southern life. I enjoyed ""Dairy Queen Days"" and ""Captain Saturday"" much better. A technical criticism is Mr. Inman's overuse of idioms referencing flatulence. They appeared much too often, and were not necessary in most of the scenes."
4,"Interesting people, interesting story, but not worth a 5.","I enjoyed the story and the people. My favorite part of the book is the birthday party at the end of the book. It isn't, however, such a good book that it deserves a ""5."" The sense of ""place"" isn't really strong. It is a book set in the South, but it doesn't seem like it. I enjoyed the ""flashbacks"" back to the Civil War. You will enjoy reading it."
3,3 stars for Chill Bola's only cd?,"I bought this cd randomly back in the day just to try it out. It was better than I expected it to be yet was still lacking a real solid production, lyrics, and on top of all that Chill Bola doesn't have a very distinctive flow...so overall it is just sub-par. If you collect west coast gangsta rap, you will probably enjoy it.."
2,Beat Bitter,"This CD was cool to me until I heard a song on it with the same beat as another album called Certified Mackin. Now music is music and people will always try to use your sound, but Chill Bola has the same exact beat on his album. Come on now, lets be a little more original."
1,"RECEIVED FAKE PERFUME, SOLD & SHIP DIRECTELY BY AMAZON",BE AWARE !!! Another fake perfume from AMAZON!! i have order this because of low price (sold directely from amazon) and when i received perfume it was BIG disappinment !! Smell only last for five minuit compared to the one i bought from Macy's it last couple of days. I order couple of other perfumes as well from amazon and those are FAKE as well. i ended up returning to amazon. WAST OF TIME!!!!
1,FAKE ACQUA DI GIO -GIORGIO ARMANI,"This seller is selling fake cologne. I do not know how in the world AMAZON link their name with seller, somebody has to call me from AMAZON or the seller and refund me. This cologne has no fragrance practically it is water inside the bottle. Need refund and I want to return it back."
3,cologne,"This is a great product, but the delivery service failed. Luckily DHL is no longer in service, so it should not be a problem."
5,Best of the Best,"This stuff is amazing....It could almost be called aphrodisiac instead of aqua di gio.... One smell of this on a guy and I am hooked! Buy this for yourself guys or for your dates girls, you won't be sorry."
5,Everyday Fragrance,"I love this fragrance. It is subtle enough not to have you sneezing and smooth enough to make an impact and a statement. Acqua di Gio has been around the block for a while now, but it's still a classic and a sure hit for that date."
4,Sensual and Sophisticated,"This is my husband's cologne. He wore it when we were dating, unbeknownst to me, then started wearing something else that I thought didn't fit him as well. I asked him to try some of the old colognes in his cabinet a few months ago because I wanted to find the one that smelled like I remember. When he put this on, it was the one. I can't get enough of it. I love nuzzling my face in his neck just to get a whiff of it. Such a sensual and sophisticated scent for a man. I can definitely pick out the citrus and wood notes. I couldn't figure out the other notes, though, and thought perhaps there was something like pipe tobacco. It turns out its hints of jasmine and ocean - perfect. My own perfume, Obsession Night, uses hints of jasmine. No wonder we like each others scent. I only purchase perfumes and colognes from Macy's, though, so I can't speak to the quality or service of this provider (reason why only 4 stars)."
1,So Small !,The 0.17oz.comes with no sprayer. It is so small and not worth the price plus the shipping. Doesn't smell like the Original.
1,FAKE!!!!!,"This is a fake product with a fake scent. I received the package and the ""made in China"" sticker was cut out and over it you see a small ""made in Italy"" label. Spend 10 more dollars and buy the real thing at a local store. The scent was terrible, the bottle was wrong, the scent did not stay. Terrible item and Terrible Seller!"
5,Nice Perfume,Aqua di Gio still is one of my most complemented perfumes. Women always say good things about it so its a safe bet for a gift.Is a little strong so be gentle when using it on the office. The 1.7 oz goes fast if its your only cologne so better get the big one.Get it. You wont be dissapointed.
5,YUM,"This smells fantastic. I purchased it for my husband. He loves it. Very, very awesome. I would recommend to anyone."
4,Very Good Quality refreshing smell!,A classic and favorite of most men. This cologne will be around for a while and well deserving of the price paid.
1,Disappointed,"I have used Acqua Di Gio for many years so I know it well. The fragrance of this product I bought online is not the same as I am use to. Maybe it is old stock and lost its true fragrance or watered down, I don't know, but I won't be buying perfume online again."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS,I've been a devoted fan of the armani fragrance line due to their unique masculine fragrances.But this was a little too weak for me.Like the fragrance but would prefer something longer-lasting
5,My favorite,"Although I've been using it for years now, I am not bored of its fragrance. I'd prefer this over any cologne, anytime. My favorite!"
4,Smells Great.....,"A long lasting scent, spray it on, and you forget it's there, but the ladies know it's there by there compliments, my friends are fascinated by the scent, it's mild, tangy smell makes this cologne one of the best men's fragrances I have ever owned. If you are looking for a woman... spray this cologne and go where there are women around and I am sure you would get there numbers..... talking from experience."
4,"Very good perfume,",Perfume is very good. I had little problem with the spray mechanism.It didn't work for some days but finally it worked.
5,good,"I received this item fast, in a good condition. Product is good as well. Aqua Di Gio is my all time favorite perfume.Love it when my husband wears it. Sensual and delicate scent. Recommend it."
1,tk,I don't think it's real (original)usually I can smell it fof a long time but this one after half an hour nothing!
3,"Not so pleased, but..","I bought 2 bottles of Acqua Di Gio thinking i had a good deal, but, turns out its not real. The cap doesnt really fit on right, and it leaks. It smells similar, but a little off, and doesn't last more than an hour. I bought it from Buy Wholesale, and they gave me a full refund for it. I really appreciate that, but. If you are looking for deals on it, chances are they could be fake. And it's not Buy Wholesale's fault, they bought it from other places."
3,3 stars,"Prompt delivery, however, I did not know that the cologne I bought was a tester bottle. Although it was still new and in packaging, it says tester bottle right on the box. It did not state anywhere in the ad that it was a tester. Other than that, overall everything was good."
1,Poor,I bought Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani For Men for my fiance for Christmas. This product was not the real Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani For Men. It smells and is nothing like the cologne purchased from a Macy's. I wasted my money b/c the seller will not return this item. Poor customer service.
1,Horrible,Thia product was a huge disapointment. it smells nothing like Aqau Di Gio. i am very disaponted w/ my purchase. it smells like a cheap knock off. smells more like old spice. i was no happy at all. i e-mailed the place i purchased it from telling them i didnt think they sent me the correct cologne. the labels were right but it smelled nothing like it was suppose to and i rec'd no response. i will never purchase from this retailer again. it was a total waste of money. not at all what i paid for. it is suppose to be the real thing and sooo was not..
1,Pathetic,"I received this cologne and gave it to my Boyfriend for Valentines Day. This is his favorite cologne and the only kind he wears. When he sprayed it it smelled like leather, oil, greasy after shave. When I tried to contact the seller they didn't reply. Thank God Amazon refunded me when I filed a claim against them. I'm a busy student and I work so I was NOT happy that I had to deal with this. Seller still hasn't contacted me. PATHETIC."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered Aqua Di Gio for a Christmas present. When my son opened it, he said the box is wet and the aroma of the cologne filled the room. The product was leaking, but we could not tell from where. I contacted the seller and they told me they would give me a $8.00 refund. I am a longtime Amazon customer and this seemed to be unfair. I have contacted Amazon and they said they will handle the refund. This order has been a hassle and I would not recommend this seller."
4,No fue lo WOW que espere...,"Por primera vez compre un perfume sin nunca antes haberlo sentido, me guie por las reviews y como el top nro 1 de los perfumes en todas las webs,,, tengo una OldSpice que tiene exactamente el mismo olor , solo que la Armani dura muchas horas mas,,, pero no fue el gran aroma que espere ,,For first time i bought an online cologne without ever smell it before, i read all the reviews and all the internet about the number 1 cologne around, i have a cheap OLDSPICE that has the same fragrance , the Armani last more hours but is the same fragrance =( ,i dont think i will buy this again... looking froward for a Hugo Boss or CH 212"
2,not the real deal,"when ordered I thought it was the real cologne. The name and box are the same, but the cologne smells different. I didn't tell my husband I ordered it and the first time he used it he said this is not the same. It wasn't that much less expensive that the real thing and I don't like being swindled. Won't buy from them anymore."
2,Not the original Gio...,"Smells great, 'just like' Gio, and the price is really good but the package and the bottle are not original. If you are looking for the original product, don't go with this one."
5,Gorgeous and Lovely Scent,"I first bought this perfume when I lived in Italy and it was first released about 10 years ago. I absolutely LOVED it. I moved back to the U.S. and after I finally ran out, I tried to find this perfume at Macy's but they no longer carry it in the stores! I couldn't believe it. Allure Magazine has this scent as a top rated item. So happy I found it here!"
5,Amazing!,Great fragrance i will recommended for any man who love to smell good and like to get complementsthank youBadillo
3,"It's ""Ok""",The scent was nice but my boyfriend complained that the scent was just entirely too light. I had to agree.
1,Fake perfume was delivered,I have used Acqua Di Gio before and I have always liked the perfume but this time around a Fake was delivered to me and I hate it. My advice is always buy from a good seller as not all sellers on Amazon are good. Amazon needs to check out the sellers before they allow them to sell on the site otherwise I see no difference between Amazon and Ebay.
3,Good price...,...but my boyfriend thinks it is fake. Packaging is not exactly like what he has bought in stores.
5,"She loves me, loves me not..She loves me!","After 32 years of marriage. She loves me even more. The cologne was my ""G"" power."
4,satisfecho,"Aunque en principio, no llego el articulo, luego lo recibi a plena satisfacion.la colonia es muy buena con olor agradable de frescura."
1,I too received a fake,"I didn't notice right off the bat but I used it for the first time after it was shipped to me and it smelted off. I've used this brand of cologne for 4-5 years and it usually goes well with my body chemistry but now seems unfamiliar. I started doing research online and it would appear that my item shows flag signs of a counterfeit and a good one at that. Every detail from the product package design to labeling is identical to the real one except for the actual fragrance itself, the high and low notes are off and the scent only last a couple of hours. To think if I would have payed the difference to have bought it at the mall (about 15 dollars) I would have my normal satisfaction instead of disappointment."
1,NOT THE REAL THING!!!!,"Very disappointed!! After many years of buying this cologne, I figured that this was the real cologne but it is certainly not. The aroma is completely different then the one I have been purchasing at Department stores for years. I am very disappointed with this purchase considering I bought 2 for both of my sons."
1,Never buy this from Amazon,"First, buying perfume through internet is risky. Even though there were many sellers offering in Amazon, I ordered the one sold by Amazon LLC. I quickly received the package. when i opened the box, I found the wrap around the perfume box is open at the bottom. Anybody who received in this condition should immediatley return it. I still give it a chance thinking Amazon would not cheat. When I use the perfume, I have the smell only when I put it on. Then gone. I would still buy things from Amazon but would not buy perfume through internet anymore."
4,Great fragrance,Bought this fragrance as a gift for my husband. He liked it! Its got a nice fresh scent and is not strong or overpowering.
1,Fake,"I purchased this item directly from Amazon. The cellophane wrapper had been opened on the bottom and resealed. It was very obvious that it had been tampered with... Not only could you see the glue used to reseal it but the wrapper was torn. The cologne is an imitation. Trying to find who I can contact, maybe the FTC."
1,Cologne leaked in box,I was not happy at all with this product. When I received it a large amount of the cologne leaked out of the bottle and coated the box. I did NOT receive the 3.4 ounces I paid for.Would not buy from again.
5,ILLEST BEST COLOGNE,ACQUA DI GIO IF NOT THE BEST BUT ONE OF THE BEST FREAKING COLOGNES IN THIS WORLD. AUTOMATIC PUSSY HITTER WITH THIS COLOGNE
2,Smells like an old woman and you can't return it.,"I bought this because I LOVE my husbands Acqua Di Gio... I wish I hadn't. I bought a 70$ bottle and hated the smell and when I went to return it, it was non-returnable. Don't buy this before smelling it in an actual store."
2,Most over exaggerated cologne of all.,"Stays on you for like 30 minutes and that's it. I got it from Amazon, so I doubt it was fake. Every guy I ask, says this is a must have. Well, I think this is too over hyped. I love my Cool Water by Davidoff and that's 100 times better than this Gio and the fragrance stays almost all day! I would still buy it and wear it at home or for short visits, but not for work. By the time you're at work, the fragrance is almost dead."
3,Not long-lasting enough,"This perfume does have a catchy smell, but it's a sort of smell that you'll get tired of fast. There are other scents that I'd rather waste my money on then this perfume. Its smell is not that long-lasting either and will quickly fade away. But if you're not that wise of spender, then maybe you might choose to buy it."
3,deosnt smell the same like the one i bought at Macy's,+ Delivery was quick. I received it in 5 days even though the tracking info said 2 weeks.+arrived in a good condition- It deosn't quite smell the same like the one i bought at Macy's.
5,A sexy scent,"We gave this product as a agift to my brother because my friend told me that every time he wears it, people stop him on the street and ask him what he has on. My brother loved it and we found the scent to be extremely sexy."
5,Excellent men's cologne,"Makes a statement without overpowering. This is a cologne for men that don't need a potent fragrance to overwhelm anyone. This is a subtle scent that women love, and find attractive. If you aren't looking for AXE or TAG adolescent type colognes, this gentlemen's cologne will enhance, not smother your personality."
5,smells fantastic!,I bought this for my boyfriend and it is the perfect cologne - smells great but not overpowering.
1,the perfume arrived broken,"Giorgio Armani 'Acqua Di Gio' Men's 6.7-ounce EDT Spraythe perfume arrived broken, that bad is that I paid $ 94.82 for this perfume, this is a hoax. Do not buy more at Amazon."
3,Formula Weak,I have bought this at malls sevearl times. This bottle is very weak in scent. Product reviews said they change formula. They did it is sooooooooo weak
1,gio malfunction,"When I received the cologne it seemed to be find, after 2 weeks of use, the pump spray stopped working.You can not unscrew the top ,so the cologne now sits unused. I should have known something was up by the price i paid"
1,Disappointed with Quality,"I've used this perfume for over a decade and the one from the seller doesn't smell exactly as it is supposed to. I think these bottles might be old, which is rather disappointing. If you purchase this item, beware you might not be able to return it as it is a flammable."
3,"Love the perfume, but...",I was slightly concerned to turn the bottle over a few days ago and notice that the serial # had been clearly cut off with a sharp knife. Hmmm.
1,Rip Off,"This is a fake. It's not the same fragrance. The bottle looks right, but the top rattles, is scratched and is not attached properly. The scent is the same. They are printing bottles, and boxes, and bottling with something similar. This is a total rip off. Amazon should be ashamed that this seller is on their site, DO NOT BUY."
1,THEY CANCELLED,"I wanted this cologne for my mentally disabled son who is turning 18 and 2 weeks, I saw the cologne, ordered it, told him and he was excited because he was getting the same kind his uncle has. Then I get an email from amazon that says this vender cancelled the order, no reason given. I had to tell my son he isn't getting it for his birthday. So I started looking at my bill and it all looks fine, everyone else I ordered from that day is sending my orders. So I go to look at the item itself, and notice the price is much higher than what I originally paid for it. So I think I have figured it out. They made a mistake and sold it to me at a price they didn't want to sell it. Now I haven't heard back from them in email, but if that was the reason. I'm sorry, but I found it on the clearance page and I ordered it, paid for it, and now because THEY made a mistake, my son can't get it? What kind of business is this?"
1,Warning~,"I just purchased this bottle of Cologne as I was low on a bottle I had purchased at Macy's. And Guess what...this is a fake, the bottle looks real, but the inside packaging is only the bottle sitting in the open box. the cologne itself smells like rubbing alcohol. I had three of my friends compare it to the real stuff from Macy's and they said..dude..You have been robbed!Please don't purchase this...or you will throw your money away!"
1,Unhappyy,This cologne doesn't smell like the one I buy from Macy's...... there was no smell waste of money. I want to return itIf anyone has the info on how to return items please let me know that you.
1,Not the real stuff.,"I too have been had by Amazon. I ordered the big bottle hoping it would be the real stuff, but I seem to have a knock off as well. I have been using this cologne for 10 years, and it has always lasted me throughout the day. With my new bottle the scent is gone within the hour. Very disappointed, and sick to my stomach over wasting $80."
1,FAKE,Sold and shipped by Amazon. Normal Acqua Di Gio lasts for DAYS. This one is gone after less than an hour. Really unacceptable.
5,Great subtle smell,I brought this cologne for my husband. It has a great subtle scent that is not too overpowering or strong. I love when my husband puts this on. Would recommend to anyone.
1,Fake,The product appears to be a fake. It does not smell the same as supposedly identical product in Macy store.
4,GREAT,"IT IS VERY GOOD FOR WHEN U GO OUT ON A DATE OF SOMETHIME SPECIAL, DOESN'T LAST AS LONG AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD (FOR THE PRICE) I WOULDN'T PURCHASE IT AGAIN THO!"
1,Fake item...buyers beware,Please proceed with caution when purchasing an item such as this online. If you open the product they will hold you liable for the sellers dishonestyand not refund you due to opening the product. This is not right and needs to be examined. ou do not buy a car just by looking at the outside without first testing it.However you are relegated the bad guy if you do so and your claim will ultimately be denied and stuck with the high cost for a counterfeit item.
3,Does not smell the same.,Does not smell anything like the last one I purchased in a store. I even blind folded 2 others and asked them. They agreed. I will use it but once I run out I will return to the store to be sure I am getting the scent I am looking for.
5,Perfect in every way.,"As soon as the product came out of the packaging, it has been by far the highest quality product I've purchased off of Amazon. Packaging is great and sturdy, almost the kind you want to keep like a smartphone or tablet box. The sprayer is great, not flinging everything in your face, not barely putting out anything, but delivering a fine mist. As for the cologne itself, amazing. I wore it to work today and received numerous compliments from people that I work with. I put it on around 6 A.M, and as I type this it is 7 P.M., I still smell it on me. Perfect in every way."
1,dont buy from desertfragrance,DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE I ORDERED COLOGNE AND WAS SENT SOME IMITATION CRAP THAT SMELT HORRIBLE WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED ALSO THE BOTTLE WAS FULL OF DIRT AND DUST THEY EMAILED ME TELLING ME SORRY FOR THE MISTAKE BUT WAS NO MISTAKE THEY NO WHAT THEY ARE DOING I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN JUST TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE.
2,What you pay is what you get,"I like about:1. No shipping charge2. The price is cheaper than Giorgio Armani and department storesI do not like about:1. The product is over its expiration date so the the smell is different and it does not stay long. I found out this after I received the package and noticed that the expiration date was removed (a cut on the package). I went to the store and bought another one. The sales told me the difference.2. Amazon or the seller should state the fact so the consumer know the difference.3. I felt deeply sorry for purchasing this product for my husband.4. I did not bother to complain or return because I later found out that there were many negative reviews and they did not receive fair return/exchange.Although the product is not a counterfeit and is much cheaper, I will not buy any perfume from Amazon unless Amazon start listing with clear statement like: 1. guarantee original, 2. past expiration date over 1 year, 3. sell by partner and no guarantee its quality."
5,By far a favorite...,"One of my 2 son's favorites [other being Play by Givenchy]! Says it drives the girls crazy:)Not too fruity, perfumey or overpowering. 2 spritzes last all day long even after working up a sweat!"
2,Doesn't smell like Acgcua Di Gio.... I've gotten a few comments on that.,"I've been using this cologne for a few years and this is the first time I've had it smell like this. It's not a bad smell, but it definitely doesn't smell like Acgcua Di Gio."
5,extremely pleased,"I am amazed that I could purchase this product, Aqua Di Gio, for the price. Less than a third of the duty free price. Just hope it is not ""hot"""
1,Received a fake one,"I love this EDT, but the one I got from Amazon (ships and sold by Amazon) was fake. Be careful buying fragrance online, especially popular ones. Now I think it is worth spending extra [...] bucks and buying at the local store.If you still buy it online - it's a good idea to do a blind test. Just go to a local store grab some paper strips that they use for testers, spray the tester from the store on half of them and yours on the other half (don't forget to mark which one is which). If after that you can easily tell which one is which not looking at the mark, there is a good chance that one is fake. You can also compare how long they last. Some fakes smell pretty close, but don't last.Hope this helps"
1,cheated,"I hate to say that I might be one of the victims who have the fake version. The scent is identical. However, the scent is gone after 10 mins. That's even after 4 sprays.. I bought this from Amazon too."
1,Acqua Di Gio,"I have used this cologne in the past and love'd it. But when I ordered from Amazon and received my product, I felt there was something wrong with it. It smelled terrible and the packaging was old, I almost felt I bought something used. The smell of the cologne smelled old as well. I will never buy another product from them again. I was very, very dissatisfied."
4,On Time In-Tack,Arrived on-time and sealed. Genuine product which I really love. Perfect size for carrying on a plane (unchecked luggage).
1,"FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!!!",This is a FAKE cologne. Not the real Acqua di Gio. I purchased this as a gift and was super humiliated when the recepient told me that it was a FAKE. Mortified!!! Extremely upset and disappointed. I currently have a claim in to Amazon about this seller. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER - THEY ARE PHONY!!! KNOCKOFF COLOGNE??? NEVER HEARD OF THAT. What a shame!!! Sellers like this one give AMAZON a bad name!!! BEWARE!!!!
1,Fake- same thing happened to me,This crap is a rip off and fake. I ordered it a while back and the smell was gone in 10 minutes. Buyer Beware!
1,Fake stay away!!!,Fake scent. Fake bottle. Sent goes within minutes.. Beware. For me shipped from NY. Beware... Please buy somewhere else.
2,Over-rated!,"This product was just over-rated and I am regretting buying it. The scent is Ok, but it doesnt last. I would have gone for another perfume of that same price. In short, people hardly notice I wear a perfume!"
2,wrong product sent,"As you can see I ordered the Armani for WOMAN. I received the Armani for MEN. It turned out that my son enjoyed the fragrence so I gave it to him. It did mean that I had to reorder the product and have it sent directly to my daughter, as this was a Christmas Present, and hope the RIGHT product arrived.They like the scent, I just didn't plan to order two of them."
3,Seller couldn't manage to get this here by Christmas!,This review is not about the product but rather about the seller who couldn't manage to get this product here by Christmas. I didn't realize that until the product was already ordered. It didn't occur to me that someone would think a Dec. 28 delivery date would be appropriate!
1,DO NOT BUY FROM MKmart company! Not 100% authentic products!,"DO NOT BUY FROM MKmart, for the following reasons that I experienced: (1) Cologne is not 100% authentic. (2) Their Email box is full. (3) No return policy posted. (4) Your product is mailed from a residential address not a business. Which the cologne smells very home made. Google the address; 2076 E. 63rd St, Brooklyn, NY 11234. (5) Lost $80 of my hard earned money & time. SAVE YOUR TIME & MONEY!"
1,fit like bell bottoms on bottom and way too short on upper body,Read the subject. I paid $70 for rush delivery and the costume ended up not fitting. Thanks for not listing how tall the costume is. I have a short upper body and it STILL doesn't fit. It pulls up on my crotch and makes the costume obscene. Ridiculous.
5,Better than Madden?,"I also had to buy the bundle pack at KB Toys, and this was one that I somewhat reluctantly bought. HOWEVER, I've had about 10 hours of quality time with FIFA and let me just say, I actually like it more than I do Madden 2001. The gameplay is really awesome, the tackles are so cool to do, like laying out the ""keeper"" (goalie) after he kicks the ball. Seriously though, this game is superior to any other sports game I've played. The graphics are fantastic, as is the commentary (pretty soon you'll be speaking like them) You absolutely can't go wrong with this title. The crowd makes you feel like you're some kind of hero when you score, waving flags and yelling, I'm telling you, this game is GREAT. Hope this helps you if you're on the edge. The weird thing about this is, I've never played soccer a day in my life. GET IT!!"
3,Not Quite Good Enough For FIFA Fans,"The graphics are better. But, there is almost always a but. It is slower than past versions. The passing .... It is still a fun game, but it is just way too slow. I am used to fast paced action with the previous versions. I would rent it first."
2,I would NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME,"HI GAMERS I BOUGHT FIFA THINKING IT WOULD BE LIKE MADEN2001 BUT IT WAS NOTHING LIKE IT THE GRAPHICS ARE TIERD,AND WORST OF ALL ITS SO BORING WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE A GOAL YOU CANT SEE WHERE YOURE KICKING THE BALL YOU JUST GOTTA GUESS AND HOPE YOU KICKED THE BALL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I HAVE A EVERY Ea sports game out there and like everyone but this one in my opion its the worst game ive ever played ya might wanna rent it first i wush i did"
3,After Madden really disappointing,"After playing Madden for about 3 weeks and reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to play FIFA. But now I'm really disappointed because gameplay is the worst I've seen in a Fifa game (I have bought every title since 1994). There's no camera angle good enough for controlling the action. The ball moves in the air like if it is an arcade game and not a simulation. I guess if EA's programmers ever saw soccer ball moving in the air because in the game is so unrealistic. I expected some great improvements from previous versions but the only improvment is graphics. FIFA needs an improved throuh passing for kicking the ball to an area you select in the field instead of trying to put it on your teammate's foot. I really expected so much about this game after playing Madden 2001 (BEST GAME ON HISTORY!), but I hope EA really improves it for next version because it needs it."
2,All Mouth No Trousers,"Another FIFA game another poor incarnation of the beautiful game. This game should have been outstanding yet it falls way short of the mark.It does not portray a realistic game of football.No tactical knowledge is needed to play this game.It is far to easy to score a goal.It does however have some nice touches - the game boasts some fantastic graphics and the frame rate is very smooth with not a hint of slow down .The commentary is second to none with the legendary John Motson providing you with a run-down of how the match is going.However as i said the game is all mouth and no trousers - stunning to look at with the sonics just as good but if you want to play a real game of football ,take it from someone who plays the sport buy ISS."
3,FIFA 2001,"At first, I was really psyched when I heard this was going to be one of the first games released. I read a few reviews on the game which led me to rent the it first. I AM SO GLAD I DID! I was not at all impressed with the game. I have previuos versions of it and proved to be the same game with just a bit better graphics. The first day I had the game I played on proffesional mode and won the World Cup with the USA team, now thats not very realistic. Anyway it was fun to play while I had. I expected more after seeing EA's Madden Football. My suggestion rent it first then decide if it worth the ... investment."
4,"I HATE soccer, but I LIKE this game","I haven't played or looked at a soccer ball since I was 9. I had to buy 3 games at Kay Bee to get my PS2. I protested, but under strong recommendation from the clerk, I threw this game in my bag and it paid off--this game is cool!Slide tackling is so graphic, it's only missing the blood. The players limp like gimps, when they get hurt. And the moves the player's style are great, including the ""Pele Shot"". The announcers are great, after a while you'll find yourself imitating them. Play in the pouring rain, get a red card and get thrown out of the game, or win the World Cup.My only con on the game is that it is soccer."
1,Punitive Damages!!,"First let me explain that I have never played this game. Now with that said, let me say that this game is probably terrible. The only person who will play this game is Brian B because he eats and sleeps soccer. He is THE soccer enthusiast. He refuses to buy or rent any other ps2 games, showing severe disregard for his friends' at work professional advice. He also is a huge rem and live fan. God forbid."
3,aaaight...,"Well... the graphics aren't anything great... good for aconsole system, but [not good] compared to latest PC titles.... not much eyecandy or anything... basically just run around and try to score..... probably fun with 2 players (though i haven't tried it)..."
5,Game is Great,Yes Madden has great graphics but this game is so fun and also has great graphics-if you play in the harder modes it's very realistic and hard to score(bicycle kick boy) . you CAN change the stadiums-anyway who cares guys about your frame rates and lack of weather control(you CAN change that too)-remember its a VIDEO game-I prefer it over Madden and NHL2001-a must buy!! to the guys complaining about weather and stadiums all I have to say is RTFM
4,Fifla 2001,If you are a ea sports fan and love soccer buy this game right now. It will keep you coming back to play more.
4,"Is alot of fun, but not very real","I find this game to be very fun to play, but really lacking in the real life FUTBOL part. The computer is unable to stop me from scoring coming up on the wings and crossing the ball for headers and bycicle kicks, even at the World Class level. By the same token, it is almost impossible to stop some player, speacially Rivaldo when playing against Barcelona, from scoring, no matter what you try. Also some of the team rankins are out of touch with reality, I can tell the designers are big fans of the Premier League, since Arsenal and the English national teams are at the top of the skills table, neither team winning anything of importance in the last few years. Also, they need to include the Argentinian league in the next one, after all Boca is now the best team in the world. Anyway, overall I enjoy playing the game, and recommend it."
2,"PS2 - Good, but a little disappointing",The games is basically exactly the same as previous versions. I expected some notable improvements in the the game overall. Improving the graphics only go so far!!!
1,Sequel to the already declining FIFA series,"God! Where should I start? First unknown leagues, same old same old controls and the need for something NEW. EA ... and this game lives up to that reputation. This game is the only one you can find in PSX because there's no other company that will challenge this ... company who makes no effort on its only sorry soccer game."
3,doesn't really work for my nose,"You have to be careful not to let it dry too much, otherwise it won't work. I am still to get there."
3,Hit or Miss,"The first time I bought this product, I LOVED it. It REALLY gets in there and pulls out all the junk that hides deep down in your pores.However, this last box I bought doesn't seem to be working as well. The strips are taking a lot longer to dry and they don't seem to be pulling things out as cleanly as they have in the past. Before, I'd pull the strip off and it would take everything out with it, leaving my pores clean and clear and empty. Now, it seems like it's just pulling things to the surface but not pulling them all the way off my face, so I have to go back and gently wash the area to clear away all the junk.Maybe I just got a batch that needs to stay on a little longer or maybe I started using more water than I have in the past.Anyway, I think it's a good product, I just don't get the same results every time I use it."
4,Adios blackheads!,"Another Biore product that I love! It works just like they say. I only gave it four stars however because I wish it was either cheaper or had more in the box. I do love them though, so I still buy them."
3,OK,Well this is good if you have small and light black heads and you have to probably finish the whole pack to get rid of your black heads on your nose. It is really pulling them out without pain or anything but make sure to use it after shower.
1,Completely useless,"The first problem I saw with these is that one of the face strips only covers about a quarter of my forehead. They are one inch by three inches. Absolutely tiny!The girl in the picture must be absolutely miniature.Problem number two - They didn't stick to my face! It took a good 15 minutes to get close. I followed all of the instructions but they just kept falling off. I wasn't talking, eating, or drinking so my face wasn't moving.The final problem occurred after I got them to stick for a record two minutes. As soon as they began to dry instead of sucking out the gunk in my pores, they dried and peeled up off my face.The final straw is that I cannot return them for a refund.Time to take out the trash!"
4,It does not get all the blackheads.,"Used on my daughters noses, it is very easy to apply and to remove, it does clean the pores but It does not get all the blackheads.Mind the time because it can dry on your skin and het stuck."
1,waste!!,"what a waste- literally only extracted 1 or two blackheads and I had a bunch that it could have ""grabbed"". Never again"
3,works well but..,"you can beat the system and not buy expensive pore strips , simply get some elmers white glue and apply it to your face, dries as a mask you can peal off and does the same dam thing for a mear fraction of the price. there's youtube videos showing the process , that's how i learned about it , check it out ."
3,It is ok but that not effective,This one did not work for me. Nose strips were perfect but the face strip just does not the trick.
3,not so great,"this does help some what,dont have you hopes up because it is not going to zap your black head in one pull.it will open your pores a bit thus making it easier to clean out."
5,awesome feeling!!!,have not gotten this yet. but the nose strips are wonderful!!! after you use one it leaves you with a fresh clean feeling! im expecting the face strips to do the same!
1,Didn't work for me,"I have big pores and seemingly permanent blackheads on my nose and chin. I had high hopes for this product, looking forward to the satisfaction of ripping out these cursed blemishes, but it had absolutely no effect on them. I followed all the directions, yet the strip was completely clear and my face unchanged. I have (as of tonight) used up the entire box, and I will most certainly not be buying again."
1,they NEVER work,Every time I follow the instructions to a T. I've experimented with different times and amounts of moisture. Halfway through the pack now and I STILL haven't pulled out more than a few blackheads. What a BS product.
4,A Great Buy,"My husband loves these, they work so great, granted he has a great nose for them to work. Where as I have trouble getting the nose ones to work, but the face ones work better for me. What is your trouble area? Each package comes with specific strips for your trouble areas. If you happen to be like my husband and me, then buy this box because I get the face strips and my husband gets the nose strips. A great buy!To see my full review check out: [...]Coming from Mom's Thumb Reviews"
4,I like it,it really did work but you will have to exfoliate the face first and then use it. i like this product but i wish they can include more strips.
4,Gorgeous Book,"I'm in agreement with another reviewer that mentioned the book could have been better written. That being said, it is well worth the price for all the fantastic paintings and drawings. A must for every fan of horror and sci-fi art."
4,"Nice Packaging, not much substance","Even without text, this book would've earned 4 stars, just for the impressiveness of Gogos' work. Within this book are large, crystal-clear repros of his most famous monster cover paintings, as well as samples of his illustration work.The only setback for this book is its lack of depth in the text. It seems that whoever was sent to interview Basil didn't ask too many questions, didn't want to really know too much about him except for his general acheivements, and didn't ask him for a demonstration of how he works. Among all of the great pics, some candid ones of the artist would've been nice, most notably a pic of his studio.Still, the images are so rich in color and character. Worth it!"
1,Don't bother.,"Very disappointing. Author obviously does not like Jimmy Vaughan and tookseveral cheap shots. Unless you are interested in the history of theThunderbirds early days, and non-relevant Memphis music scene, no new info."
1,Don't waste your time,"If I had $2.50 left to spend, I'd rather spend it on a McDonalsds burger. The SRM consultant I gave this book to told me how useless it was. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't waste your money on this,This book is just a collection of SAP help. You might as well get SAP help .pdf document on the web. Waste of money!
5,my favorite,I grew up using this perfume. It is my favorite Avon prefume. It has a nice soft smell of baby powder.
3,just jeans,"nothing special, and had a terrible experience with the'delivery'. wont use amazon or this jeans place again. both places lied about delivery date, cancellation policy, no tracking number ever assigned, and hit my credit card AFTER i called and canceled."
2,Disappointed :(,"The product is below my expectations. Very strange size, does not fit the waist, nor the length is correct.I tried it on once and never had the courage to try it on again. Now its lying somewhere in my store :("
5,Priceless music! Six Stars,"I was first introduced to this music in the '70's while completing a degree program in instrumental music. Our jazz harmony prof (a fine jazz pianist) used some cuts as examples for ear-training in quartal harmony. I was amazed and smitten by the sound and bought all the vinyl I could find, which I still have to this day. Words cannot describe how excited I am to find this music on CD. This is some of the finest vocal jazz ever arranged and performed."
5,Magic Voices make liquid music.,"Giving this collection 5 stars is like saying the Hallelujah Chorus is a nice number. I have been a Gene Puerling fan since I bought the HiLo's Love Nest on a 331/3 album in the late 50's. They were unequaled by any musical group until SU. I have collected the HiLo's and SU albums, tapes, and CD when ever and where ever I found them - thinking I have found treasure each time. This collection is aptly named. I've told my wife if I ever get into a comotose medical condition, just put this collection on the CD changer and the ear phones on my head. If the music get through, I will think I've arrived in heaven."
3,Disappointing Package for The Price,"Although their are some known Artists in this package, and I never take anything away from the creativity or talent of any Artist. This seems like another attempt to capitalize on the booming Reggaeton market. There is so much Reggaeton product out there, the consumer must be very selective. If you have extra dinero, fine, buy Reggae Explosion, otherwise, I suggest- Bario Fino by Daddy Yankee, The Last Don by Don Omar, The Beginning (good compilation with solid hits), mas flow (either volume) or Ragga Nacion- (some great songs and videos, also a few stinkers)."
4,correlates modelling and observations,"As computers have grown in power over the last 20 years, climate modelling has become more and more powerful. Assumptions that had to be made in the 1980s, due to computational restrictions, like a two dimensional simulation, instead of a three dimensional one, have been abandoned.The book gives you an idea of the state of modelling, as of 1999. Plus, as its necessary companion, climate observations. The book emphasises the correlation of these as necessary to improving the models. An expertise in the pure computational algorithms is not enough.Given the ongoing advances in computing hardware, some aspects of the book are undoubtedly already slightly behind the times. But most of the ideas are still current and useful."
4,This is Rock and Roll,"When you`ve had to much to drink or smoke,this is the music you want to hear.Good for dancing,fighting or um...being with your girl.All classics usually have to stand the test of time and the Georgia Peach still delivers.Its real rock and roll by a real rock and roller.This,the early Sun Records sides with The Killer and Chuck Berrys Great 28 are essentials and the conerstones that modern popular music is built on.Believe it."
5,Explosive music from a great pioneer of early rock'n'roll!,"Little Richard will always be the architecht of rock'n'roll! Alongside Elvis, Little Richard is at the top. I'm a teen and this is just about all I listen to with other 50s and 60s singers and groups! It starts it all off with, ""WOP-BOP-A-LOO-BOP-A-WOP-BAM-BOOM!"" Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally, Lucille, Good Golly Miss Molly. You name it, it has it. Great 20 songs from a pioneer who helped form rock'n'roll!"
2,OK but.....,"This book is OK, it has a lot of useful info however more than half of the book is on uniforms. Since the Navy is revamping all the uniforms I fear that this book will become obsolete. I think that the uniform section was wasted and should have been used for something more about......maybe....LEADERSHIP! The uniform section is basically just a carbon copy of the uniform regs."
3,WuShu Forms Video,"If you are a WuShu practitioner or kun fu, get the video.The forms are well done, i can see the combat application in them.I was after a combat video, showing combat take downs etc.The forms are like Katas in other martial arts.So if you want to learn new Forms, Katas get the Video, if you are after Combat or Self defence Videos get something else.What are my Qualifications:In martial Arts for 30 Years, working in Prisons, worked in Sydneys toughest Pubs and Clubs."
2,Written for idiots,"This book sounds like it was written for 5 year olds. The grammar is ridiculous and I spotted more than one misspelling (waste instead of waist, plural ""girl's""...come on) It is not really a story, so much as a collection of antecdotes. And most of them start out with ""Here is a story about one girl that..."" or ""Here is a good story."" NOT a well written book."
1,Don't bother...,If you value your reading time at all don't bother with this book. If not for the subject matter I could very well imagine this being written by a seventh grader. There are numerous typos and the language is simple at best. If you must hear bare bones stories about the industry then have at it. But there are better books out there.
2,Boring....,"I wish i didnt waste my $$ on this one. I didnt like how she spoke to the reader, it was very 'dumbed down'. also, where was the editing? this book is loaded with grammatical and spelling errors. Also, we are all adults, there was no need to reference certain anatomical parts with the words 'cookie' and the like. i would have preferred slang to silly little words like that. i was glad it was so short, i certainly dont recommend this book to anyone. I read CANDY GIRL, and that book was great! check that out instead."
2,Nothing stunning,"These type of books always start the same:""I worked with all these cheap slags in a stripclub but I never dun anyfink like this myself because I have high morals""... yeah...It does help you realize though that every stripper you ever though you made a connection with was simply after the cash. period.Easy read on the basis of the IQ of the person writing it. A little shocking in parts but basically all stuff you probably already knew."
2,How do you spell illiterate?,"Most of the stories seem made up to portray the author as a princess in a cesspool. They're poorly written and overly dramatic. Diamond is a gem every one else is garbage. I didn't like the way she portrayed other strippers as lowlife garbage and had no sympathy for them or their life. Yes there are sleazy types - male and female - in strip clubs, but Diamond isn't a prize."
5,The real truth about Vegas!!!!!,"One of my guy friends handed me; A Stripper's Tail, one night and I was done reading it by the next morning. I had to read all night, I couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over. I grew up in Sin City and live here still. Everything that Diamond talked about is the reality of the Las Vegas life. It can be glamorous, sleazy, ruthless and even, deadly. Men visiting here really do range from the fabulous to pure trash. She didn't hold back a thing and you could hear in this author's voice her true love of living the life of an exotic dancer. She broke free of the stereotype. She's bright, full of life, and not ashamed of the path she chose. She tells it like it is and isn't scared to say what she thinks. That's a rare quality."
2,Elizabeth Lite,"It is surprising that the author of such fascinating and well-researched biographies such as ""The First Elizabeth"" and ""Great Harry"" could also write ""Lilibet,"" a piece of biographical fluff. This book manages to be disrespectful of its subject without offering any juicy insights into her life or reign. The only real shocker is the portrait of Prince Philip who comes across as a bore and a bully with an unfortunate grating laugh.Erickson is such a gifted biographer, especially her work on the Tudors, that this book is especially disappointing: one expects so much more of her."
3,Okay but on the Fluff Side,"A very readable biography but I agree with the previous reviewer that it tends to be a bit on the light and fluff side. Many of her citations for quotes turn out to be from other biographies, most notably Kitty Kelly's THE ROYALS which diminished the seriousness of the work for me. But still, an interesting portrait that highlights the ordinary humanness of the Queen."
4,Great sugar free drink,"As a diabetic, I am always looking for sugar free products that have real taste and not just some poor substitute for the ""real thing."" This is a good option for anyone, diabetic or not, as the flavor is true and makes a wonderfully refreshing drink."
2,hard to cleen & wasteful,"This product works okay. Will handle larger quantity of garlic cloves than your standard garlic press. But the crushed garlic is hard to remove from around the blades, and the gadget is overall hard to clean."
1,Does nothing more than my $10 Veggie Chopper,"When I only need one or two cloves of garlic for cooking but in order to use the Garlic Pro I have to use at least 5 or 6 cloves (I'd be happier if they only tell you about this fact before my purchase). So now I have to hand peel all 5 or 6 cloves (how about the ""no garlic fingers"" comments by the other reviewers?). Then the Garlic Pro would chop it down into huge chunks and more twisting supposedly will get it finer at least my old veggie chopper can easily do that if I pump it a few times more. But it's just not true with the Garlic Pro and the big chunks of garlic refuse to budge and stay that way. Then a blade came loose and I took it back to the store I bought it from. After I got my money back I checked the others on the shelf some also have fine cracks and the blades will definitely come loose it's just a matter of time. Not sure why I bought it in the first place it doesn't do a thing more than my 10 year old $10 veggie chopper."
2,Beware of knock offs,"I had one of these for years, but it died after one too many trips to the dishwasher (HINT: Do not put this in the dishwasher).After trying FOUR other kinds of garlic choppers, I can safely say that this is THE BEST GARLIC CHOPPER IN THE WORLD. Seriously.UNFORTUNATELY, the chopper I received from the seller ""warehouseprices4u"" is a total knockoff of the real product and is terrible."
3,DVD extras?!?,"I love the new Thundercats show, as the anime is top notch quality that matches the quality in Young Justice. I think the anime quality is so good that the new Thundercats show deserves a Blu-ray release.I like the how the concept and characters have been redone. I think the voice casting is excellent, where the characters actually talk normally instead of the staggered talk of the original show. I don't want to say anything more about the new Thundercats show, as I don't want to give away any spoilers.Once again, however, why are there no DVD extras?!? Why would I want to buy the DVD, as the episodes can be bought as digital downloads from the WB Store?"
3,reviews are all posted incorrectly!,How about a real review that is actually about the product listed that was released on 10/18/11!?!?!?! ALL the reviews are either for the original series or some bootleg garbage. I don't know why they are linked to this item but this is pretty lame!!!
5,Thundercats HOOOOOOOOOOO!,"This is a great remake, especially if you are a fan of a more ""anime-like"" art style. It seems a bit more adult than the original Thundercats, but is definitely still appropriate for younger audiences. A great pick up."
5,Great Art,"The artwork is different than the last but the same standard level. (Samuri Jack is also awesome). The story as you know is a little different which can be refreshing because you do not know what is next, yet we still have characters like Slive and others we know. Tigra and Shetara's relationship enters into the mix and that is different but intriging. I will get a copy ASAP! LOVE EVERY MINUATE OF IT!"
4,Stunning Re-make of a Cartoon Classic!,"Thundercats (2011) is a reboot of the popular 80's cartoon series of the same name. Many of the characters and core elements of the original show have been preserved in this new version, but cleverly re-imagined to keep the story fresh and exciting. The animation quality ranks among the best of cartoons produced today and is supported by superb voice acting and clever script writing. The producers have also inserted several ""easter eggs"" throughout the episodes that fans of the original show will appreciate.The DVD itself seems to be somewhat hastily put together. It features eight episodes from season one, but no special features. I suspect a larger, complete volume set is slated for eventual release, but for now, at such a low price (~$15), it's a great deal and well worth the purchase."
4,Old to New,"I grew up watching The Thundercat. It was and still is one of my favorite Programs of All Time! The honor and respect it teaches is timeless. I would not have been the same person I am today without the leasons placed in this amazing cartoon! The new one is(from what I've have seen) geared to this group of younger people and is well made in the same type of positive mental seeds and good behaviors that all young persons need.The story line is well written, but I would have like to seen it in the older style or pick up where it left off. It had to beat The 80's Program! But it is still a GREAT CARTOON! Thunder!Thunder!Thunder!Thundercats HO!!!! Thundercats Forever!!!"
3,Not like the original,"I was hoping to share a generational experience with my son, but it just wasn't the same for me. My son enjoyed it, that's why i gave it three stars. The whole thing seemed a little cheesy to me, but i am a grown man, so i guess it's not supposed to apeal to me anymore. Good for the kids, but does not send you down memory lane."
4,great show,"great series, but dvd quality is less then impressive.... i hope this is on blu ray soon...much cleaner on cartoon network...great stories though............"
2,Soldiers of change,"SPOILER!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE LOUSY MOVIE IN ITS' ENTIRETY!! Clifton Davis Dies leaving wife, baby, and saving a little Vietnamese girl. Wasted toooo much time for a lousy ending. Father dies too. Only good point... Daughter in law and uncle inherit fortune. Sad about the civil rights movement and how people treat one another. We all came from One and He will judge those who hate His children."
1,Should be sold as sci-fi,"Historically inaccurate, utterly falacious screenplay. I think our children deserve something accurate and well done. History did not need to be re-written to make it accessible or moving. Overall, this is Hollywood Pap."
4,Very nice.,I think that this book tells a fun story. My students will enjoy it. I do think that there are better Ananse books out on the market now. This is nice because it was one of the first and a classic.
4,A treat for the inquisitive,This is an extremely entertaining book. I am just dissapointed some of my faves were omitted.
2,"impressive, but neglects international & indy production","This is a very impressive work regarding Hollywood film culture and technical topics, but it lacks information and accuracy on recent (post 60ies) international & indy productions. It also overstresses the biographical side of individual entries, to the detriment of style description."
3,Other reviews are a bit misleading,"Just received my copy today, and I am a bit disappointed. While this is surely a great reference for fans of the film industry and the people in it, I can't see this as a book for fans of film. There are no entries on films and no way to look up who worked on a particular film. What this book has, it certainly has a lot of, but it doesn't have everything."
2,It is NOT a FILM encyclopedia,"A word of warning to the public. This is a mistitled book. It is NOT a film encyclopedia. You cannot look up specific films. Basically, it is a collection of brief biographies of people in the movie business with some unnecessary technical terms thrown in. At the end of each entry is a list of the films in which the subject has appeared.Fine as far as it goes, but if you want reference work in which you can look up who played the role of Bubba in Le plus Vieux Mtier du Monde, this is not it."
5,Great Reference Book on Film,"I have bought every edition of this book, and each edition is dogeared from use. Almost everything you wanted to know about movies, actors, and people behind the scenes is here. Most of the biographies are detailed with either complete filmographies or lists of most notable films. There are few inaccuracies in this book.Individual movies are not listed, of course, or else this book would run at least two or three times larger. Still, this is one of the best, if not THE best, reference book on film available."
5,Incredible compendious book,"I mistakenly bought this book (I was looking for the field guide version) but it is so beautiful and informative I had to keep it. If you are a birder, this is a must-have. Great drawings and photographs and lots of info to keep you going. The book sits by our back garden sliding door and is a great reference book to have at your fingertips."
1,Defective binding,"Wonderful book content. Horrible quality control. The binding split the entire length of the book after just a few uses. Now, the pages are falling out. Incredibly poor quality for such a respected organization."
2,She writes really well.... but,"Just where in the heck was the plot?I finished it today. I want to know if Maggie achieved happiness? Did she die when the magazine quiz predicted she would? What happened to that part of the story? It's almost like someone at the book binding company took two unrelated books and bound them together to see if anyone would notice.There are too many little tangents that don't go anywhere in this book. The scenes are described beautifully, but most of them could have been stripped away and it wouldn't have made a difference."
4,Exellent researched book,"This is more of a compilation rather of the works of both Ted Fio Rito and Ina Ray Hutton - where they were, what they recorded, track listing, and for whom. It is thoroughly researched and very complete. Areas where items were unknown were marked as such.If you have any interest in either of these two legends, I strongly suggest this book as an outstanding reference material."
3,Definitely Useable,"This book will get you into most of the bells and whistles that HTML can offer as well as a little Java. I originally thought that this was the same author and was surprised (and disappointed) that the focus had shifted from authoring in Notepad to using FrontPage. Still, he accomodates both users and I was able to learn how to build frames in pure HTML using this book. He also covers tables more in depth than in the first book, in addition to animated gifs, sound, and forms. As I learned more about HTML, I ended up investing in a copy of FrontPage and this book became much more important than the first. The HTML editors like FrontPage are simply too powerful to ignore and this book is more along the right track in showing a mix of manual and editor methods."
2,not a good choice for DIY green cleanning,"I ordered these for making my own cleaning supplies. I've been using them for months (almost a year) and everything seemed fine, but yesterday I opened the 2 bottles that had contained mixtures using vinegar to make refills and to my horror I found that the insides had been corroded and the silver finish around the neck was flaking off!These may be advertised as ""stainless steel"" but I now believe that they are an inferior metal that mimics the appearance of stainless.I have had zero problems with the bottles that did not contain vinegar, so I will continue to use them for things like water, but I'm disappointed to say the least. I was really excited about the bottles when the arrived- they look really cool and I liked the idea that I was using a recyclable product for my cleaning supplies, guess you know where those bottle are now."
2,Not as represented - these will be returned.,"I ordered this set, believing that what was pictured would be what I received. Not the case. I, also, received three in silver, therefore not being able to distinguish one mixture from another if I were to use these bottles. They are being returned. I suggest that the seller either change the photograph in order to represent the product properly or send the three colors as shown."
2,Misrepresented,"While the bottles seem OK and do spray well, the bottom line is I need 3 spray bottles I can tell apart. It didn't happen. All three are silver. Amazon.com could not confirm if there was a problem when I called them regarding the previous review. They also seemed less than interested in the fact that a third party is posting bad information on the Amazon website. If you want a nice spray bottle (I haven't had them long enough to know if they will last) and don't need to tell them apart, this is your product. But obviously you need to be very careful when ordering from Amazon.com. Evidently they don't take action if their partners are misleading the consumers."
2,Be careful,"I thought these spray bottles would be perfect for what I need. 2 of them are fine. The 3rd one however had a leak on the side of the bottle and bleach leaked out of it. The holes are so tiny I would have never seen them, but I'm lucky the bleach didn't ruin my counter top and floor where it leaked. Chances are that this is a fluke, but be careful if you order them."
1,Only got one bottle,"We received the silver bottle but only one, not the three pack. It works well for my toddler's hair spray obsession. We fill it with water and she feels like she can put on as much hairspray as she desires."
1,Only received 1 of the 3 bottles!,This is advertised as a set of 3 bottles. I only received 1 bottle in my shipment. No packing slip or other paperwork. It is unacceptable to not receive what I paid for.
1,Quality is what you pay for,"The body of these are fine, but the cheap plastic spray nozzles were cheap and plastic. Traveled with one and the contents ended up all over my suitcase even though I screwed it on as tight as I could and turned off the spray nozzle."
1,Very poor quality,Do not buy these. The nozzles are very poor quality and one already stopped working. Now one of the bottles started leaking and I had to throw it away.
1,Don't be fooled by the photo,"In addition to being delivered 8 days late, I only received silver bottles. Yes, it does say ""misc"" next to the description but other reviewers experienced the same thing so it's a very successful job of false advertising that this company is clearly not going to change.They should change the photo but they seem okay with poor reviews/returns."
2,Instant Ice Packs,Very pricey for the small size of these instant ice packs. I would recommend other types filled with gel (glycerine) that can be reused. These are way too costly and would force me to consider an amputation if I had to rely on their long term use. Would carry a few of these only for emergency use since they do not have to be refrigerated.
5,Wow! Two heavy hitters on the same CD! ( ^ _ ^ ),"Will Downing and Gerald Albright are an excellent pair! My fellow jazz enthusiast, you'll have to agree that this CD is hot, hot, hot!"
5,TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS AND OPEN A GLASS A WINE...,"Will and Gerald take you on a magical ride that is non-stop. The soulful title track ""Pleasures of the Night"" will set the mood for the rest of the evening. Will and Gerald's version of ""Michelle"" and ""Girl Blue"" will stay on your mind the rest of the evening. I don't think 5 stars are enough to describe this cd......"
4,Smooth Jazz plus soul!!,"Will and Gerald does well as the CD defines what smooth jazz is. The title track and their rendition of ""Stop, Look, Listen..."" are the highlight of the well produced CD. Some tunes I could have lived without like their version of the Beatles' ""Michelle"". Overall, a fine CD. Recommended!!"
3,Too much hype,"This disc is 1.) an achievement in romantic smooth jazz, and 2.) an example of what is wrong with today's ""radio friendly"" producers. Both Gerald Albright and Will Downing sound SOO much better than this live! The duo is in full ""swing"" mode on the title track and get into a seductive groove on ""Stop Look Listen To Your Heart"". The rest of this disc is best served for those that do not own the original versions of ""The Look Of Love""; ""Like a Lover""(check out Al Jarreau's version on his GH CD); and, ""Here's that Rainy Day"" (refer to Phyliss Hyman's definitive version). If I didn't know these artists as true humans, I'd swear they were machines!All in all, the thought behind this collaboration was a good one -- however, it would have benefitted with some real emotions. Maybe Vol. 2 will have them......I can DREAM can't I?"
5,Need to relax?,"This is a great collection of songs to simply cozy up and relax with after the rush of the Holidays. It's just another great offering from the talented Will Downing. If you're reading this, you already know the merits ofAmazon. They're the best for problem-free ordering in my estimation."
5,"A jazz lovers ""must have""",Both of these brothers are genius' when apart but together they have come up with a collection of songs that would melt away the worries of even the most stress filled day. The CD soothes my soul and reminds me that I can be a comfort to someone as Will and Gerald are a comfort to me. Pass it forward. I first purchased this CD in 1999 and then re-purchased it through Amazon in 2008. Thank you Amazon for making it so easy to recapture what I had lost.
4,Not easily catagorised and very well written,"The best thing about the Rose Macaulay novels for me is the depth of attention she gives to her characters, both in creating them and exploring them through the books. The central character here, Denham Dobie, is particularly prominent because she is a socially inept, utterly straightforward induvidualist against the background of a very worldly, cultured society, which she is abruptly thrown into on the death of her father. The author isn't afraid to point out her essentially self-absorbed character either. The plot of the novel is essentially to do with Denham and her cultured new relatives coming to terms with each other, but the author has some very painful and affecting things to say on the way on subjects like the relationship of love to induvidual freedom. The prose is as clean and clever as always, especially in contrast to that of some of the characters."
4,Entertaining,"This is a fun CD that would be perfect to play all day on ""race day"". It's not really something I'll play on a regular basis, but the songs are lots of fun. For those true race fans out there you will appreciate the reference to certain drivers and the sentiment involved. There is lots of humor and fun, as well as a bid of sentiment."
1,not so good purchases,a good thought that did not work out as planned but then you pick some winners and some times you pick not so good winners
1,Butchered.... bad script.... so bad,"Big fan of the original... Just going to to sum this up fast... If you like the original, dont buy. If you like great horror flicks, dont buy. If you like Vampire flicks, dont buy. The script is sooo bad. You will want to pull your hair out, especially with the acting in this one, and the BS factor is out of control. You have been warned."
1,"The film sucks, sucks balls that is!!!","Really don't waste your time, the film has little to no storyline. Little by the way of a script and the effects are average.I was waiting, waiting, waiting for something interesting other than the usual vampire bites victim ""action"" nothing really happened! Boring!!!"
1,worst movie ever,This the worst movie I have watched in recent memory. I wasted two hours of my life & would rather have done something more productive with my time. Not worth buying or renting at Redbox. You have been warned watch at your own risk. If there was a way to rate this movie with 0 stars I would have done so... 1 star is too high of a rating.
3,Cool,Let's see if since this is coming out they will release Fright Night 2. I am NOT paying $140 for it!!!!!!!!!
3,"Rental, fast download","The movie itself was entertaining as far as remakes go. It has the typical flaws of all vampire movies, but the characters were well cast.The download to my TIVO was quick and only had a few digitization glitches throughout the movie. All in all another one for the memories, and not for the collection shelf"
2,BAD 3D,"The story itself was ok, but the technical quality of the 3D production drove me nuts! A lot of ghosting and parallax . The day scenes were alright but most of the movie are night scenes which is to be expected, and this is where the problem lies. Many scenes with white outlines around actors, double shadows etc. If you want to enjoy this movie it must be watched in 2D. Save your money on this one. I have seen old style anaglyph look better."
3,Entertaining,The movie was entertaining. Darker then the orig. I grew up with but still a good movie. Good to have for your movie collection.
4,"OK, I'm Officially a Marti Noxon Fan","It was good! It left me grinning... This particular writer is very good at setting a fast pace. I've never found vampires very scary (who has, really) and I saw the ""scary"" claws, and thought it was probably a good ""campy"" movie. And it was-the way you'd expect Fright Night to be-but I was honestly impressed at the tension the movie created. It was fun."
2,Welcome to Fright Night but Not so Welcoming this Time.,"A modern remake told in a slightly different way but its the same old story, charlie watches next door neighbor through his window in suspicion that something isn't quite right, with all the missing students in class everyday. Eventually he discovers he is a vampire and his girlfriend is the next victim, so he recruits peter vincent to hunt down and kill the vampire. Had some interesting ideas, but what hurts the movie is its crude dialogue and over use of the F word and whatever else spoken obsanity thats written for a teenage audience, its unnessary. Peter Vincent isn't likeable and its disrespectful towards Roddy Mcdowalls original performance. Evil Ed had the worst performance and dialogue, Colin Farrell is the strongest performance and what made the movie. Overall there wasn't much originality to this remake, Its an okay movie but the original is alot better."
4,Turn out all the lights...,"We have a large 3D screen. Turned out all the lights, cranked up the surround sound -- we sat back and got lost in an entertaining little horror movie remake. Was more serious than the original, more CGI pronounced. Just a tad bit darker image quality than the original -- but in the dark, effective!"
5,Loved it!,"I loved it! I'm a fan of vampire movies and tv shows and this movie is now one of my new favorites. Colin Farrell was execellent as a vampire. A btter vampire than Robert Pattinson. Anton Yelchin was so cute in this and tough as a vampire hunter in training. David Tennant was really amazing as Peter Vincent. My sister and where fsngirling when he came on, those parts where really funny. I would recomment this movie to anyone who love vampire movies to buy it."
3,STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL,"Let's say you haven't seen the 1985 version of this cult favorite. Is this a good movie on its own merits? Probably your answer would be yes. I'd agree that it's an ""okay"" movie---the lighting is horrible---many scenes are so dark you can't tell what's going on. Colin Farrell and David Tennant's performances are pretty flat and uninspired. So one can't help but appreciate the 1985 original---it was over the top campy fun, boosted by Roddy McDowall's excellent Peter Vincent and the movie's sharper tongue-in-cheek approach. While I understand the reboot's more serious tone, I enjoyed the original much more.It's not a bad movie, just unnecessary--savor the original instead."
2,Fright Night,"I seen the first one, this could have been better, they left out alot good stuff, it's really not worth the 3.99,"
2,For Young Teenagers only..,"A kids movie without the music blasts isnt at all scary. If your older then 13 forget it, not worth the time"
1,Complete Crap!,"Finally got around to watching this remake and must say that I wasn't surprised by how bad it sucks ... no pun intended! The original is so much better than this recycled garbage it's not even fun! Even the special effects seemed as though they were something out of a ""B"" movie. Charlie was such a wuss and a douche bag that I was actually rooting for Jerry this time around! Colin Farrell actually makes a great villian, just to bad the rest of the cast blows! If your looking for a good vampire flick, look elsewhere because this isn't it. Just hope they don't try to remake Interview with a Vampire ... that would be a freaking disaster ... lol!"
5,Colin Farrell is one badass vamp!,"I hope there is a sequel just so I can see Colin Farrell reprise his role. He did such a great job of playing a vampire, I is actually kind of creepy how good he was at it. Having McLovin in this movie didn't hurt either. Lol. Check this one out and sit back and enjoy!"
1,bad,The special effects were much better then the original. That was the only part that was better. The movie was bad .
5,Vampires and Vegas,"I normally dont enjoy updates of movies I know and love but this is something else! Sarandon's Jerry was delicious but Farrell's is feral and sexy. Having a cameo performance by Sarandon as a 'normal' guy was wonderful. The effects were mind blowing and every performance was spot on. David Tennant's take on Roddy McDowell's character was such fun. If you didnt know the original, it was a great vampire movie; for those of us who went before, it was a new facet to a superb movie and hats off to the new edition. Great print; arrived quickly and well enough packaged that the battered exterior still protected the contents perfectly"
3,Eh....,"If you are a huge fan of the original, like I am I would not buy this movie!! The story line is completely changed and not for the better! Horrible horrible remake!!"
4,fright night 2 disk blu ray,"The remake of the 1985 classic fright night was not only a beautiful high-def transfer, but every actor played their heart out for their rolls in the movie. I can easily say that this is my favorite roll by Colin Farrel because he played a really insane vampire. Anton Yelchin also did great in this movie as a freaked out teenager. Even the people who were killed did a great job... well, dying! This in my opinion is a must own on blu ray!"
3,it was okay.....,"It was okay. Its differ from the original fright night made in the 1980s with the two Coreys. The vampire from the original played a small part in this one. Also, this one has less comedy. Again, just ok."
3,disjointed and sad.,"There is a sad and cold undertone in this version that was missing in the original. Humans are callous to each other, and characters who lose loved ones show no grief. Several amazing actors are wasted in this disjointed film where plot lines are picked up and dropped. The movie is excessively dark in a literal sense as well: it's often unreasonably hard to tell what is happening.A person who like the orginal Fright Night will probably not like this version: it is missing the wit and humanity of the first."
5,"Surprise, Colin Farrel is scary!","What a great movie a great mix of violent and scary. Inventive and fun, you'll really enjoy Colin's no nonsense vampire."
3,"This is for the Reboot release, not the original movie.","This link is suppose to be for the upcoming reboot of ""Fright Night"". I'm guessing that the reboot is going to be another attempt for a 3D movie. The movie should be released in theaters in August. I'm wondering if they will be releasing a blu-ray copy before the movie goes to theaters, we can only hope."
2,Not what I expected,Movie is dragged out and poorly written story line. Nothing like the original. I would consider this a b movie
4,Not sure why the bad reviews,"I love horror movies and after reading the reviews when the movie was at the theater I fully expected to hate this one but I was very pleasantly surprised.It is not a strict remake, the movie has similar characters to the first movie but it actually is almost as good as the original but in a different way. It is much more of a straight up ""bad vampire"" movie, with Colin Farrell being about as un-sparkly as it is possible to be.It's hard to beat Roddy McDowell as Peter Vincent but David Tennant does a good job of bringing the character into the 21st century and I wish there would have been more of him in the movie. The same with Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Ed. This kid is great in everything he plays.Also, a big thumbs up for the cameo by Chris Sarandon, I love it when they use original stars in the new movies.Overall, it's a strong 4 star movie. Very fun to watch and just scary enough to even be watchable by the wusses in the family."
4,Cheeky and Gory at the same time...,"Just as I expected. It was in the style of the original. I will say that they picked the right actors to play the parts. Colin Farrell as the vampire is seductive and frightening at the same time. David Tennant as the Vegas magician Peter Vincent is great as the humorous side-kick for the ""kid"", Charley Brewster. The Peter Vincent character has shades of The 10th Doctor's irreverence showing through at times. (David Tennant really should do more comedy.) Anton Yelchin is great as the scared ""kid"", Charley Brewster. And, Toni Collette certainly plays the clueless mom. Good special effects. All-in-all, a tolerable remake and very watchable."
5,"Different than the first, and amazingly done","I will admit that when I first heard Fright Night was getting remade, I frowned and said ""Well here goes another remake that will likely ruin a classic's name."" Fortunately, that was not the case here, I was amazed at how well this was made. Don't expect the same semi-erotic atmosphere as the original. However, do expect a great film that adds a new flavor to the story, one of the biggest changes was to Peter Vincent no longer being the old aged, late night tv host and is instead a younger and rather funny and dark Vegas magician with a past that is somewhat revealed to us.I encourage the fans of the original to go ahead and watch this, chances are you wont be disappointed."
1,Fluff Night,"I don't know what this was, it was soulless, heartless Hollywood fluff at best, Colin Farrell was not sexy and was horrible in this,he was just phoning it in and seemed to be struggling to keep the American accent needed for the role which became annoying,they should've let him use his natural voice, he's supposed to be a great actor but it definitely didn't show in this movie. I was glad when Chris Sarandon made his cameo appearance because it reminded me to praise him for how much better he was was in the 80s original,half a star goes to the special effects b/c they were ok, but the writing was awful b/c they felt the need to explain everything that was obvious in the film, the cinematography was poor,there were severe developmental issues, zero suspense, and it seemed rushed, I tried to watch it as a stand alone movie and it didn't work, this movie was a travesty. Stick to the original."
2,This Vampire Movie Sucks...,"Quick review - poor remake. expensive 3D Blu Ray at $31.99.The 3D is not at all exciting or innovative, the basic movie is lame, and I'll probably never watch this again.In my fervor to add 3D movies to my small library, I jumped at this as I remembered the original as fun and stylish.Would have been better off saving my money for another, better title. SAVE YOURS. Pre-Order Titanic 3D!!!!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad, bad. Watch the original instead.","I was psyched to learn that they were remaking Fright Night for a new generation. To find out that Colin Farrell, a devotee of the original and a hottie, was going to play the vampire made the anticipation great.I was disappointed that NONE of the great things about the first movie--the humor, sexiness, campy scariness, clear videography, and empathetic characters--were present in this remake. This version was a mindless, soul-less slasher film with no appeal.I walked out after the first half.Do yourself a favor and watch the original for a real treat."
2,Dissapointed,"Overall I was disappointed in the movie. I read good reviews on the movie, and mainly on the 3D...the 3D was basically non existent, minus a few scenes which were actually really good but they only lasted 2-3 seconds.Cons:- dark scenes looked terrible (not a tv issue either)- acting was not great - especially in the beginning- sound was not good- 3D was awful - a few scenes were good, but only lasted a few seconds.Pros:- story was good (should be for a remake!)If I would have went into it with lower expectations, I think I would have enjoyed it more."
3,Okay,I enjoyed the location and the actor's performances.However I thought it was short on scares and didn't build up any seriously tense moments.I have to admit I liked the original one much better.
2,Forgetful movie,Very silly and forgetful movie. Waste off time and I'm surprised an established actor such as Colin Farrell took this role. I say avoid and don't waste your time.
3,"""Not Bad, But Original is Better!""","Colin Farrell and Anton Yelchin star in this 2011 horror remakeof the 1985 film. A teen discovers that his new neighbor is avampire. This isn't bad, but the original is better and Colindid ok as Jerry, but Chris Sarandon defined the role. Thisdvd has nice picture and sound plus a couple neat extras.I still recommend this."
3,"Original is a classic,Colin and 3D saves this one","The remake when compared to the original doesn't come close to adding up.Colin trys his best to save the movie and he was the only character that even came close to making it interesting..The new Peter Vincent..pathetic...the new Evil Ed..pathetic and stupid looking,not scary at all.No evil zombie bodyguard protecting the vampire,no good transfermation scenes.like Evil Ed turning from vampire to wolf to dead human with stake in the heart like the original.HOWEVER....after all those negatives..the 3D kinda saved the day and made it watchable.Amy's part at the end when she turned was creepy,and again...Colin tried his best.And the 3D was pretty good."
4,Great tune,this is a brilliant song.The guitar in it is deadly and on the gran turismo three on the PS2 in the background it really is the cheese!!Buy it!
5,An exciting and emotional rollercoaster of a book.,"This book gave me a different look of a man that I have seen many times. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Although I knew what the outcome was prior to reading it, it still brought tears to my eyes. Well worth reading it."
1,Not a good choice for serious study,"This book is not a good choice for anyone interested in a serious Bible study.The authors inject opinion where facts cannot support their position in several areas. It is obvious to me, at least, that certain doctrines are assumed to be correct and therefore written into this book. Also, there are several incorrect statements that would confuse novice readers, such as, ""Out of all his followers, Jesus chose 12 men to be his disciples (Mark 3: 13-19), giving them the title 'Apostles' (Luke 6: 13)"" (p. 557). Anyone who can read these verses knows that Jesus chose 12 men to be Apostles out of his many disciples. He, in fact, had numerous disciples, but only 12 Apostles.I had to buy this for a college course in Biblical Perspectives, but wouldn't buy it for any other reason. I own several other Bible handbooks and consider them to be far superior in content."
3,Modern scholars undermining the Bible,"If you are looking for a handbook that minimizes the inspired stance of the Bible, and explains the acts of God as natural phenomenon, then this book is for you. There are some good features, such as archealogical and historical background that make it an interesting read. However, you better be theologically sound before you read it. I would not take this book as my primary authority on the Bible."
1,A disappointment,"While it looked promising at first, I found this book to be deeply lacking as it takes a secular view of faith and attempts to cast matters of spirituality into the mold of modern pseudo-intellectualism. If you are serious about studying the ancient texts of the bible you will need to dig deeper using other sources if you want a balanced perspective. The book seems to excel at amassing numerous factoids but fails to hold them together with the fabric of life."
1,"""Did God really Say...?""","There were a number of examples in this book where the authors seem to question the truth of God's word--1: ""...it might be unwise to seek to reconstruct Israel's earliest history from the stories in Genesis..."" (p63) 2: ""Creation is described as taking place in six days...This is not a chronological account...""(p116) 3: ""Noah's story: As with creation, we should approach this account as story...""(p122) There were others I don't have the space to mention.I personally believe that Satan is using his first and greatest ploy within this book: ""Did God really say...?"" (Gen 3:1) It is subtle, but it does cause the reader to question God's Word.As long as I'm the librarian of my church, this book will not make it to the shelves."
4,Scholarly without being dry,"I found this book to be fascinating and highly readable. It is both scholarly and well-balanced. The book does not seem to push either a fundamentalist or liberal theology. It is well organized, giving the reader a helpful overview of each book of the Bible, chapter by chapter. It also pulls together interesting historical information aided by graphs, maps, and wonderful photographs. I consider The Handbook to the Bible an invaluable aid to anyone wishing to increase their understanding of and appreciation for the Bible."
4,Excellent Introduction,"This is an excellent introduction to the Scriptures. Contrary to the other reviewer, I did not find this book to be liberal at all. If anything, it makes a determined effort to take a more ""catholic"" (universal) approach that avoids sectarian views. I heartily recommend it to anyone wanting an overview of the Bible."
3,L.A. DOO-WOP GROUPS FROM THE 1950'S,"DOLPHIN'S OF HOLLYWOOD WAS A PLACE BACK IN THE 1950'S IN L.A. WHERE YOU COULD HEAR A LOT OF LIVE R&B, DOO-WOP AND BLUES (RACE) MUSIC. THIS CD FEATURES SONGS BY DOO-WOP ARTISTS THAT WERE IN L.A. AT THE TIME, AND RECORDED ON ART RUPE'S SPECIALTY RECORDS LABEL, MOST NOTABLY ON THIS CD ARE THE TURBANS. A LOT OF GOOD DOO-WOP. DON'T LET THE TITLE OF THE CD FOOL YOU, THESE ARE STUDIO RECORDINGS, NOT LIVE ONES FROM DOLPHIN'S OF HOLLYWOOD, BUT THEY PROBABLY SOUND BETTER BECASUE THEY WERE STUDIO RECORDED. IF YOU LIKE DOO-WOP FROM THE 50'S YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD."
5,Bloom County ROCKS!!,"What can I say? It's Opus, Milo, Cutter John and Steve Dallas.This is one of the greatest comic strips that ever existed.I really love this book."
3,"great content, terrible presentation","bloom county is a most wonderful comic.HOWEVER, this reprint of the book is unpleasantly cheap. most annoyingly, the sunday strips inside are reprinted in black & white, obscuring a lot of the detail visible in the originals. the cover is also noticeably cheap, flimsy and low-resolution.i was very disappointed to discover these attributes when i bought the book. one would be better served by a copy from the original printing of this collection."
3,Full color? I must be colorblind.,"Buyer beware: the editorial review states that this book contains eighty full-color pages, but it doesn't. It contains eighty pages that obviously were at one time or another in color, but which are now a messy conglomeration of grays and whites, much like something you'd expect to see coming out of a low-grade fax machine.Many years ago, I read another copy of this book that did, in fact, contain eighty full-color pages, so I know the pages were in color at some point. However, the only colors on the book I received from Amazon.com are on the front and back covers."
4,An interesting inside story of particle physics,"This book is not for the timid or casual reader, but more intrepid readers who are familiar with some of the aspects of quantum mechanics will find it an interesting and personalised synopsis of the field from approximately 1970 to the present - a period co-inciding with the author's career to date. Quantum mechanics is certainly one of the most significant theory's of the 20th century and the period covered in this book is of particular interest because of the large number of new particles discovered during this time. But this is not a physics textbook - 't Hooft includes many personal insights and conversations with other important figures in the field - giving the reader a rare inside look into the process and motivations behind the breakthroughs. The book has a conversational tone and there are no complicated mathematics."
3,"""YOUNG HERO OF SHAOLIN""","There are many different movies with the same or similar title, especially in this category, and as far as I know, there are two ""YOUNG HERO OF SHAOLIN""s (I don't mean 1 & 2, but completely different series with different actors and plots).One with Meng Fei and Tan Tao Liang starring - 1970's (a.k.a. Enter the Whirlwind boxer / Prodigal Boxer 2 or 4),and another with Shih Bao Hwa starring - 1980's.Included in this set is the latter 1980s'.""Editorial Reviews"" are also confusing.They should not mention Tan Tao ""Flashlegs"" Liang (not Ling) who appears in YOUNG HERO OF SHAOLIN not included here.Meng Fei certainly is in ""Silver Spear"", but he is killed as soon as he appears. So if you are interested in this set only for Meng Fei, you should be well-advised!"
3,obligatory list,"YOUNG HERO OF SHAOLIN 1 and 2 (1975-76) follow folk-hero Fong Sai-Yuk as he grows into adulthood, studies Shaolin kung fu, and eventually, in one of the most incredible martial lion dances ever to be screened, thwarts the enemies of Shaolin.JADE DAGGER NINJA (1979), kung fu killers vie for the possession of the most prized martial arts treasure of all--the purple jade badger.THE SILVER SPEAR (1979) is a cult classic revolving around the titular weapon, the most feared combat tool in the land.I liked this collection.. not the best transfers but what do you expect in a pack?"
3,Very informative,"I found this book enjoyable to read with a lot of illustrations.I would like to recommend this for everyone interested to know his or her future!Best wishes,Aaron Lee."
1,Beautiful but tiny,"Beautiful book with LOTS of information. However, the print is very difficult to read. Need a magnifying glass to read the articles. Would be beneficial if the book were bigger (currently 8-3/4""). I know I missed more wonderful information because of the tiny print on glossy pages. The illustrations were magnificant but again hard to read the words."
2,poor selection,"This isn't a particularly good cross section of stories. There are only seven but the same plots and elements repeat. I understand that the character of folklore merges stories and grafts stolen elements...but you shouldn't have such close cousins in such a short collection.I mean, there were something like eight Baba Yagas."
3,Disappointing graphics,"While the lessons are very good, clear and thoughtful, the images of the hieratic signs and the hieroglyphic bookhand are maybe the worst I've ever seen. Both were apparently done by hand and scanned in. Usually, I like that, but the resolution used was so low, it is sometimes hard to identify the actual signs. Readability is extremely poor, but no argument with the actual scholarship. There really is no competition for this otherwise very good book."
1,Terrible,If you are going to write a book about writing and understanding Egyptian Hieratic then you would think the Hieratic examples in the book would be legible! I can't even begin to describe the difficulties in trying to decipher the authors own Hieratic writing and compare it to actual hieratic inscriptions. It's like a first grader drew the hieratic with a mouse on Microsoft Paint. On the basis of taking a beautiful script like Hieratic and turning it into stick figures on crack I rate this book a Total waste of money!
3,Informative? YES. Inspiring? MAYBE,"I planned to give this to my teenage nephew as a gift. I read a few chapters and the information is good, yet it gave me pause. I couldn't figure it out at first. Then I realized what it was: AS AN ADULT I found it overwhelming and preachy in a self-righteous way. And I'm a pretty conservative person (in the abstinence before marriage camp for one). I think it could turn off some teens. In the case of my nephew, I felt it would not inspire him to take the ""high road"" because the book wouldn't be inspiring to read. So, it's not a bad book, but I suggest you read it before giving it to your teen and judge for yourself how it could be received."
5,Required reading,"Forget the boring ""classics"" that most high school students have to read over the summer - this book should be on EVERY school's summer reading list. It was wasy to read, put in a way that won't make teens think of it as a boring lecture on what they should and shouldn't do. It is also a must-read for parents of teenagers. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"
4,Daniel Piehl,"Sean Covey writes another help book that focuses on teens. Being a teen myself, I can see he knows what he is talking about (I among others fell into the trap in the Relationship section he set, knowing we would turn to that chapter first). The book is well written and comes from someone who is really in tune with the feelings and thoughts of teens. A+."
5,Every Teenager Should Read This!,"I bought this for my 14 year old son. It has actually kept his attention (he's not too interested in reading, typically). This is full of great information that every kid should learn. Impressed!"
1,Boring,"I have 3 kids and can't get any of them interested in listening- even when I have them trapped in the car. The author is mostly monotone and not exciting enough- maybe a better voice would help, info can be useful"
1,Not as described,"Please do not buy from this seller! Got Fright Night Part II (Blu-ray). I was upset, not an original legit Blu-ray. It was bootleg copy!! The box & artwork looked very real,very good,but the blu-ray quality was fuzzy & grainy. NOT A BLU-RAY."
3,Vampires Sibling Seeks Revenge In Sequel!,"Not as strong as Tom Holland's 1985 original, this Tommy Lee Wallace vehicle has William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall returning to the roles of Charlie Brewster and Peter Vincent, and Julie Carmen showing up as Regine Dandridge, the vampire sister to the original's lead villian (Chris Sarandon). Some unique scenes and special effects but not up to par with the original film."
1,Quality is worse than VHS and Laserdisc. Terrible!!!!!!!!,"The picture quality is like a TV channel. Its like your watching the movie on TV. There is fuzz and disturbance (like a regular TV channel would have). The picture is not sharp at all and the colors are a little off. I'm at a loss for words on the quality of this DVD. Very disappointed! Fright Night, which is 5 years older than Part 2 is exactly how a dvd should be, so what happened to this one? The picture quality on this DVD is worse than the VHS and Laserdisc!!! Artisan needs to be contacted to have this DVD taken off the shelves and re-released. And, if they won't do that, we need to get together and sign something to have Columbia Tristar (who released the first Fright Night on DVD) to release Fright Night 2 on DVD."
3,inferior to the original,"I've seen this once and it was once too often. Fright Night was groundbreaking in how it treated vampires legends and poked fun at the late night television horror show. This is just boring. I just don't buy that this new enemy, the previous vampire master's daughter is even related to him. He was solitary; she has this entire herd of people and ""children"" around her. I think the director wanted it to be sexy but since I don't buy the set-up it really just seems silly. The only good thing is that they got the original heroes back and some of the new ""baddies"" are creepy and well-acted."
1,Terrible Vampire Movie!,"Fright Night II Has To Be The Worst Vampire Movie I have Ever Seen.One Viewer Was Complaining About The Picture Quality Of The Disc Who Cares The Movie Itself Sucks!Along With George Romero's Martin FN II And That Are Tied For Worst Vampire Movie's Ever Made!Awesome Vampire Movie's Fright Night , The Lost BoysPerhaps If Tom Holland Did The Sequel To Fright Night II It Would Have Been An Excellent Vampire Movie!"
1,No Widescreen,"Okay so this wasn't the best sequel, but for completists such as myself, I expect that when a movie (finally) comes to DVD it should be the best possible version of the film. This is a cheapie. It's been cropped-NO WIDESCREEN here. The picture is grainy and the soundtrack is only 2.0. Artisan-you guys better shape up! I'd suggest saving your money until a better version is released...if that ever happens."
1,"Great movie, TERRIBLE DVD","The film I believe is a 4 or 5 star, depending on your love of 80's horror. But this is almost a worst case scenario for DVD. Full screen, the image looks like first gen VHS at BEST. I'm not even an aplha nerd, but there's no reason for this picture quality. THEN, there's the extras. There are none. NOTHING. I'm surprised they even have a menu. Your option is start, or chapter select.I don't know what the market is for this film, but I know it's a very good film, and a decent sequel to the seminal first installment. With the first being remade, you'd think it would have been enough to spur a bit of a renewed interest in this film. Guess not. SEE the film, but I'd rent it."
2,Kind of a disappointment,"After seeing the first ""Fright Night"" countless times, when I saw part 2 was coming to DVD, I had to get it. I had never seen the movie and I figured since I was such a fan of the first I would get it... Well it wasn't NEARLY as good... Some things I don't understand. Like in the first one, Amy had until dawn before she was fully changed, but good ole' Charlie went through it for days... And I didn't really like the werewolf-like vampire. Regine's whole little gang was pretty annoying. If you'd like to see a GOOD vampire movie, see either the first ""Fright Night"" which is my favorite, or ""Vamp"", which has the whole comedy/horror thing going on also."
5,ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!,"This is a pretty good film!Not as good as the first,but good.It still has Roddy Mcdowall and that is a mojor +.This frightful flick picks up from where the last one ended.It is a must have for any horror movie collector or any fans of the first Fright Night.If you like vampire movies you're in for a treat!"
1,I should have taken other viewers advice,The quality of this dvd is very poor. About a 2 out of 10. Don't waste your money.
5,nearly!,Not as good as part one but not far off.This is more a remake than a sequel and both McDowell and Ragsdale play their parts as good as ever.Tough the film gets a little confusing it is well thought out and is by no means a let down.
5,When entertainment and horror get along well!,"I have not seen the prequel, but to be frank, I really enjoyed this story right from the beginning till the end. One of the best parts about this film is, it is very fast paced and the entire cast do extremely well which results in a good chemistry between each one of them. A stunning performance from Julie Carmen, is one of the reasons that adds to the film's flamboyancy. If you are into vampire flicks, you are gonna surely love this tiny little gem of a film, 'Fright Night 2' may not be a masterpiece, but it succeeds in delivering whatever it promises to the viewer."
3,Good Sequel bad DVD print,"Fright Night part 2 is the sequel to Fright Night part 1 with William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowell reprising their roles from the first movie again taking on Vampires. It is a good solid effort, some will call it a keeper to own, others might said it was good to rent. To me it was better than the middle of the pack as far as Vampire movies go, about as good as To Die For. And it was about on par as part 1. If you liked Part 1, you will like Part 2..The DVD is long out of print with no word as to a re-release, which is bad because the DVD transfer is the exact same thing as the VHS. Total VHS full frame quality. It deserved a better treatment.To me it is not worth the amount that it is on DVD since the transfer is of VHS quality. You might as well look for a keep the VHS if you want to get the movie and wait for a better release. It might be a long time though."
2,Hello Charlie....,"... While it's good to have this on DVD (if you don't happen to have a VCR hooked up to your TV) this version of the movie is bad!!! You know you're in big trouble when they don't bother putting at least a trailer or TV commercial in as a Bonus Feature, but instead they list ""Full Screen Version"" (Like is that supposed to be a good thing???). What a major disappointment guys. }:(="
2,"Decent Sequel, Poor Quality Dvd","Far from being as good as the original, Fright Night 2 sitll remains worthy of watching. But be warned about the horrible picture quality of this Dvd. It has a grainy picture and many scenes in the movie are horridly dark. Besides that, true horror buffs will want this in their collection. Hopefully a better copy DVD will arise on the market in the future."
4,"""Good Sequel!""","William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall and Julie Carmenstar in this 1988 horror sequel. A college studentand a horror host meet a vampire wanting revenge.This is a good sequel and Julie is great as Regine.This dvd has decent picture and sound, but noextras. I still recommend this."
4,Excellent Product,"I've owned three of these canvas backpacks. One's zipper broke and I couldn't fix it. The other two are working just fine and I've had them for years. For me, they are the only backpacks that are the right size for both full french easels and large Versa plein air easels (as well as other necessary equipment). It's not especially sturdy or well made- but it's the size that works and if you're just carrying it relatively short distances from car into the field it works just fine."
1,Scoob1214,"I have no earthly idea what so many others found interesting or entertaining about this so called ""Urban Classic"". My head was dizzy from all the seemingly dozens of miscellaneous charaters that were introduced, but really not relevant to the storyline, muddled and convoluted as it might be. I'm glad the book was passed on to me instead of spending me money. Oddly enough, the other Teri Woods novel I read ""Alibi"" was fairly interesting, almost as if there were two different writers penning under the same name. I just didn't get it at all. Very disappointing."
3,"Good effort, not a horrible read, but definitely not the greatest!","It wasn't a horrible book, but it surely isn't one I would recommend to spend your hard earned money on. This book is seriously over hyped. I read alot of books and some which are great and some which are alright and those that I don't finish reading. This book was an ALRIGHT one. However, I did skip through some pages of pure non sense blabbering. There were too many characters. No build up or background as to who they were really or how they built their relationship. Quadir and Gena fell in love overnight..he bought her lots of nice things, took her out alot and ran the streets. That was the plot. It was almost as if the story didn't have a plot! It was just running on whatever. I didn't like it. I do commend Teri woods 3 stars for a great effort. She clearly has potential, she just needs a better story line to work on! I Don't recommend this book."
4,Thrill Seeking,This book is one of the best that i have read in a long time.I brought the book and finished reading it in one day.I could not put it down!I searched for other books from this author but did'nt findany. Big ups to Teri Woods for a wonderful job.
5,The hottest book I read this year,"I had just gotten finish reading the book yesterday. In the week I read the book, it had me always wondering what is going to happen next. I think the book was so hot that after i was done reading it had me wondering about the characters lives what would they be like if the story haven't ended where it did. This book to me was a multi-purpose novel: It was romance novel, a blueprint, a survival guide, and a guide full of landmarks all in one. If there's was another for the book, it would definately be called ""The Blue Print"" because it shows the ways to handle life from the poor to the riches. That's why I give the 5 stars."
4,I enjoyed this very much,"If you're looking for a remarkable novel, well crafted with lyrical prose and deep meaning, then do not read True to the Game. But if you're looking for a great little book about the street life, with an interesting story line and very believable characters; then by all means do read True to the Game. Practically everyone compares it to The Coldest Winter, and I found myself doing the very same thing. After I discovered that this book in fact was written way ahead of The Coldest Winter, I began to relax. If this book had been published and given wide spread publicity back in 1994 (or 93) when it was orginally written..well there would have been no comparison. We all would have considered it off the hock. I loved the characters, especially Gena and Quadir. They were so in love! And as for all the death and violence in the book, well, read the paper, look at the news..it's all real. Good Book and a quick read!"
3,Okay,"I like this book on a purely trashy level. It was like reading the National Enquirer you read it because you need a little junk for your mind but don't take it seriously. With that said I read this in 1 day but I hated the lead character Gena. Until I read the coldest winter I could not believe a person could be so shiftless. She's supposed to have this great Love for Quadir but you never get that impression until the end. All she did was shop and look cute. She had a hard life growing up but she does not know the value of a dollar? Considering how quickly she pisses through money is anyone else wondering how long that money gonna last a shiftless, mindless, non working cluck head? You should read this book because despite what I said I did enjoy it."
3,OKAAAY!!!!,"I thought this book was okay. It kept me interested but not as much as some others. I liked how it was written in the 80's though and I also liked the characters. Mainly Quadir, they just don't make em like him anymore. Anyways, I will read the sequel to see what happens to Gena but I probably won't rush into it."
2,Not quality material!!!,This book was all over the place and just plain not what I expected. Especially after ready excellent books like Dutch and Dutch II. I think maybe because it was her first book the writing was kind of shakey. But I'm sure natives of Philly who read this book are going huh? The story of the infamous Junior Black Mafia was turned and twisted around horribly. Names of people just popped up all through out the book. You'll have to go back and read again to try to figure out who she's talking about. The way it was written is like the reader already knows who the character's are. Not! Ok so in the end Gena gets the money. But I got confused when Quadir asked her to marry him and he said her name as Janel Louis Scott. How did the name Gena come from that? Too many characters popping up out of place and uneccessary.
2,This book was hyped up too much.,"Half way through this book I wanted to quit reading it. I still haven't finished it, but so far it is really hard for me to keep reading because I still do not feel a connection with the characters and they are getting on my nerves. I was told that this book was similar to Shannon Holmes's ""B-More Careful"" which was OFF THE HOOK. Although the author of true to the game tried to use the dialogue of people who grew up in the drug game, she failed to get us involved in their lives from the jump. I give Teri Woods props tho and encourage her to keep writing, but other works will need improvements to maintain the reader."
5,Wow!!!,"This was my first Teri Woods book, and boy was I in for a big surprise!!! This book was very very exciting and interesting if you don't have it you must get it. It's an action filled page turner all the way to the end. I'm hooked on Teri Woods after reading this book."
3,Heard so much about it guess i just expected more,"It was a good book all in all but I had to skip over a few paragraphs because some materialistic things were descried down to the ""T"" I felt it was unnecessary. It took my about 2 days to read this book and usually it only takes me a couple of hours I guess once I got into it I realized what was going to happen in the end anyways."
3,It was a good book...,"This book was interesting. I thought it was a little TO Ghetto, but I liked it and couldn't put it down. I was very affected by this book with all the different events that took place. When I finished reading it my feelings were truly hurt, and I must say I did bust a few tears. It really made me sad and I think that's why a rated it as a 3. It reminds me so much of all the dudes I knew that are dead now. And the whole thing about the bestfriend I'm sorry but there is know way I would be able to go on like she did without my ACE!"
3,From what I was told,I couldn't believe that people were so materialistic but then I had to think back. I asked others that have read this book years ago and they said it was really good and very close to the reality of the time in Philly. Although the story is fiction it does mirror the way things were in Philly with members of the JBM. I just didn't know it was that viscious. The story was good. Ms. Woods certainly kept things interesting because something happened in every single chapter. I did get confused with the many different characters but then I appreciated it. It kept the book interesting and not dry or slow.Good read.
4,nice read,i enjoyed this book alot. i couldn't put it down. the story was well written and the characters were great.
5,True to the Game,"I would like to say, so far the book is excellent! I also think that some of the reviews from readers are insightful when a person is trying to decide if they would like to purchase the book, however, it doesn't help when the reader decides to tell the plot of the story as did the reader of January 15, 2001 because I haven't finished reading the book yet. So that person really destroyed the ending for me.All in all, keep up the good work Ms. Woods and hope to hear from you again.2 fingers"
4,Love after Death,"It's a good book with sex, drug, and love. What else can you ask for. It is a page turner and makes you cry at some parts esp in the last few chapters. Gena is a strong woman and is faithful no matter what. Quadir is beautiful man and a great protector. In the end I wish if this also was a Part II just to see what happens to the characters. Just to see if a romance did occur betw to characters no need to say names it will ruin the book but you will know what I am referring to once you read."
5,excellent,"I loved this book, this was one of the best books I ever read before. I had seen other peoples reviews saying how good this book was and i got it and loved it. The relationship between Gena and Qua was definetly real. They were so real with each other. The only thing that I did not like about this book was the end when Terri woods kept killing people off. There was no need for that. Other than that it was good, I think everyone should read this book. Its the best."
5,this book is boss i mean words can't even describe it,True to the game was the best book i ever read of 03 i mean i could not put it down. Since it was summer i could read all day. Quadir was my baby when he died it was so sad i cried. I read that book in 2 days. I think everyone should read it i mean i recommend everyone to read but mostly everyone has cauz i'm sure people talk about it alot.Gina that was my dog 2 i know how she felt when she lost quadir. well if u don't read this book ur dumb cauz this is the best book ever and that's all i have to say
4,It's Cool,"I read this book and I really think that you have to be of the proper mindset and mentality to really, thoroughly enjoy this book. You could definitely not be a conservative, close-minded person and enjoy this book. I read this book and enjoyed it for the entertainment value; I didn't get much else from it."
5,True to the game,This book was really excellent and a eye opener to those who are in the game. It was fast pace and a good read. I truly enjoyed this book
2,A Street Tale,"A typical street tale about young girls looking for ballerrific boyfriends and getting caught up in the street game. The book was a quick read and held my attention, but it did not live up to what I thought it was going to be, Terri Woods is very respected in the genre of Urban/Street Fiction so I will give her future works a try.Reviewed by Aiesha"
3,True to the Game,"I think that this book had a decent plot but it could have been written a little better. There were so many spelling errors and at one point the next page started in the middle of another sentence other than that ending sentence on the previous page. I also agree that there were too many characters in the story. Some of these people didnt even have much relevance to what happened in this book. So maybe if a different author had written this book (with the same events), it would have been much better."
3,Could have been a 5 star book,"I was told that this book was a close if not equal competitor of ""The Coldest Winter Ever"". I agree that there are some similarities but felt that it could have been a little more developed than it was. If you're a ""quick to the point"" type of reader, this may very well be the book for you. However, a climax isn't nearly as good if there's little to build up to it."
3,Not as good as B-More!!!!!!,"While True to the Game was an appealing story, it was no where near as RAW as B-More. I was a little dissapointed b/c I read B-More first. I was expecting more graphic details about the street game vs. a ""men in the streets cheat regardless"" fest. Also, was a little confused about what happened with the wedding that supposedly took place. One minute they were engaged, the next minute they were married? I don't think the writing flowed that smoothly. Series of events were mish-moshed and there were too many characters coming out of the woodwork. Another thing - one mention was made of a cell phone that Gena was using when Qua got her the ride. Why didn't Qua have one? He only had a beeper? One would think a multi - millionare dealer would have a cell phone especially if his girl had one. Cell phones weren't that popular back then anyway. Not a very convincing story line because it lacked consistency, but otherwise, it was a cute love story."
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this novel on the GHETTO pretense however, I found it was quite far fetched I mean the drug game is not a fairy tale and those who do surive it it's not all peaches and cream. Always remember you reap what you sow!!!!"
4,Oh Boy!!,"When I began reading this story, I thought it was going to be another one of those ghetto stories without a moral . I was surprised. The story was very realistic and it gives the reader a front row seat into the minds of the people that glamorize this life style.Gena and Quadir are two gifted people who used there talents for the wrong reasons. They wanted material things. It was not until the found true love for each other that ""the Game"" became to lose some of it glitter. Unfortunealty, it was too late. Teri Woods has done one hell of job at describing this underground world and expressing it in the language that is also popularized by those that live in it. It also has a good moral - All that glitters is not Gold! and What goes around comes around!"
5,THE BOMB,"THIS HAS GOT TO THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME...I REMINDED ME OF THE COLDEST WINTER EVER,,IT KEPT ME TURNING THE PAGES..I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN..THIS IS DEFINTELY A BOOK THAT WILL KEEP YOU READING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT .I DONT WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ IT YET BUT, THIS IS A ""MUST BUY"" BOOK..EXCELLENT STORYLINE, DRAMA , VIOLENCE,FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE .."
4,Very Realistic!,This book was extremely realistic...The situations seemed to be extremely authentic and true to life.The way Terri Woods explained them in her writingmade you feel as though you were in the middle of itall. I actually felt as though I was gonna get shot!The editing wasn't very good because there were alot of typos and that can be kind of a turnoff.But the content in the book was interesting enoughto keep me reading.True to the Game was a real slice of life.
5,Banging !!!,"This book was too GOOD. I couldn't put it down. I fell in love wit Qua right along wit Gena, cried wit them as their friends got killed, and laughed out loud when Gena told Denise and Qua's moms off. One of the best book i've ever read !!! Read it !!! 1 Love."
1,GHETTO TRASH,"I don't even know where to begin with this piece of ghetto trash. This book came highly recommended to me, I will never listen to that person again. Since I was around twenty years old when the Junior Black Mafia (JBM) were running things in Philadelphia, I am aware of how a young woman can get caught up in the money and the power. But come on...Gena from the Richard Allen Projects, meets a drug dealer from Philly in New York? Come on! This book displayed the worst side of some black females. I knew several members of the JBM that are now in prision or in the grave. Gena was and continued to be driven by money. Even at the end of the book! How about doing something good for yourself, like finishing school or getting a job. This book depicted and glorified the drug lifestyle. In one part Qua was so happy that he had become a millionaire...okay...off the backs of black folks...that's something to be very proud of! This book was pure-D crap!!"
2,PARTIALLY EMBELLISHED,"... Magazine recently featured the author Terri Woods. Sheis towards the end of the spectrum of Gen X. Growing up during thesame period as myself, I am totally familiar with this era. Hip Hopmusic categorizes this time period significantly. We all remember thehuge rope chains and Eric B and Rakim melodies. The hot beamer coupesthat stalled along 125th street and the hot summers in North Philly,but this novel is emebellished beyond belief. Woods depiction of thedrug game in Philly is totally distorted. I didn't feel sympathy forthe main character. I don't feel that she was a heironess. She was amoney grubbin, non workin, narcissistic prostitute. This novel ispoorly written and should have stayed in the hands of streetvendors. Although, I do admire the way Woods understands heraudience. For this reason , I gave her two stars. She must give herfemale characters more substance."
4,I liked it.,"I liked this book, but I must admit, I would have liked it a lot more had people not gassed me up about how good it was. My expectations were set so high, it fell a little short. I was expecting it to blow my mind! It didnt. But it was still really good. I will definitely pick up part 2."
2,Boring...,I have read all types of Urban Fictions..This book is boring and not well thought out. Im stuck in traffic everyday so I have the book on tape. Glad I do-because it helps to pass the time-otherwise I would have put the book down. The plot is just not all thatr interesting. And I'm tired of reading the SAME story..Drug Dealer w/gold digger girlfriend. Blah..Blah..Blah...
4,i loved the book,"I loved this book. It was very action packed and very realistic to street fiction. I want 2 read the 3rd book but i'm scared to buy the book because of the reviews it got on here. So if someone has it we can trade I have tons of book. alot by nikki turner, zane and others. Just it me up."
4,True To The Game,"The book that I have read is a very sad story. This book is about a young beautiful teenager girl who suffers a lot in life. Then she meets love of her life, unfortunately he is a hustler.She begins to have a lot of conflicts in her life with her friends and boyfriend. She was once in a abusive relationship which she couldnt handleanymore. This story starts off really good and then ends up sad. It tries to let the audience know that life isent a joke.I really enjoyed this book True To The Game. One of the reasons why I enjoyed this book so much was because it is based on what really happens in life to most people. This book can really teah you a lesson in life, and really gets to your heart.This book also makes you realize that life is too short to fool around and mess up your life. I would say that I would read this book all over agian. I would recomend this book to all my friends and everyone out there who thinks they might enjoy it."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER...,"I commend Teri Woods for writing this novel and all that it took for her to get it out to the masses. I wish someone would have proofed it better and also maybe she should have spent more time on character development. I have finished the book and I really don't feel connected with any of the characters. They did not pull at my heart strings. The lack of character development and the abundant superficial qualities made some of the novels key moments seem unreal, as if it could not happen. The relationship between Gena and Quadir seemed also undevelopment. Maybe that is the point Woods is trying to make. That when in the drug game there are no developed characters and relationships are fraudulent and unrealistic. Hope she comes better next time. We need more black writers....but with quality work!"
2,I think I'm being genorous...,2 stars may be a stretch. This book I can't say it was bad but I can't really say it was good either. You have 17 million dollars + and you contemplating on rather or not you should get out of the game? I think not... It's called investing. You got all the money let your money make you money. But hey it was just a book so let me calm down. There were too many characters popping out of nowhere. I'm still trying to figure out who Nitah is and who Jalil is? At times the book was going in ever direction possible. Teri Woods tried that's all I can say. I don't knock anyone who is out there doing there thing but the book could of been a lot better. Gena was dumb. Quadir was unrealistic. Gah Git? what is that? I don't know. I am skeptical of purchasing her others. But remember that this is just my opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own.
5,loves it,This Book this Book THIS BOOK this really all i can say. This is the best hood books ever. This was the first hood book i read and i can tell u that at the end if u r not feeling sad or even crying {like i did }theres really something wrong. Because what the two main Characters had was something just so magical. It had a mix of drama and love. And knowing Quadir was just madeup i fell in love wit him seriously. i was just 14 when i read it but SO WHAT i thought i was in love with him and him and Gena's relationship. It is just a amazing book. If u havent read go get it now SERIOUSLY!!!!!!
4,True to the Game,"I read this book in 1 day and it was really good. Besides the grammer and editing of this book I found it to be captivating. I felt like I knew each character, I laughed and cried with them. I absolutley loved Quadir, Terri did leave the door open to a sequel and I hope she finishes with it, maybe she'll talk more about the twins Bria and Brianna in the next one."
1,Ever heard of an editor?,"After hearing many great reviews, I decided to read the book myself to see what all the fuss was about. I was very disappointed. First of all, has Ms. Woods ever heard of an editor? This book was filled with so many errors that at times it was distracting. In my opinion the plot was boring. I'm struggling to understand what all the fuss is about this book and this author. For those of you who are avid readers and truly know good authors and storytelling, save your money and if you must read it, borrow it from the library."
5,The Classic Of All Urban Books Today!!!!,"This book is extremely good from beginning to end. I immediately fell in love with Gena and Quadir and adored them( giggling to myself). I bought this book years ago and till this day, i read it a million times. I also own part II of this book and currently reading it. Teri Woods is a great writer and her imagination to her novels are FIERCE!!!! =)"
2,True to the Game,"Didn't like this book. All the main characters were typcial and unbelieveable. Some of the situtations in the book would not have happened in real life. There were too many grammar errors that completely distracted me from actually reading and understanding the novel. But I will say that the book was entertaining, but if it wasn't on my book club's reading list I would have stop reading this novel after the second chapter."
5,Tru To Da Game,Simply at the top of her game ...she made me an Urban Reading Maniac..now hurry up wit Dutch 3
5,Off da hook...,It was a great book. Enjoyed reading it!!! Can't wait for the next novel. It was off da hook.
4,ALMOST A GREAT BOOK,"True to the game has a wonderful main idea, and I read ""B-more Careful"" (which MMP helped produce) earlier this summer. I am telling you [and I hope Ms. Woods has the opportunity to read some of our reviews] because I cannot say the book was excellent because of so many terrible grammatical errors. ""Be More Careful"" was written the same way and a reader cannot truely enjoy a book with so many words mispelled and twisted up. If Ms. Woods would hire an educated editor, her work will become MAGNIFICENT. Other than that, hers and Ms. Holmes' ideas are good. Four stars due to the errors. PS Everyone who enjoyed this book will also enjoy ""B-more Careful"" (Short for Baltimore)by Shannon Holmes"
3,Good book but come on!!,"I give the book 3 1/2 stars, it was wildly entertaining but come on, the lead character was a loser, if she wasn't giving up tail and cute (which is she had nothing to do with) would she have anything and besides the material this woman had no sense of conciousness. I know that this book is FICTION but art imitates life and she was a cluck head, no job, no skills and no way to truly support herself. Someone needs to write a book about what happens when chicken heads get old. That would wake some people up."
3,good!,"This was just a ""good"" read. The end of the book was a given but this book still kept me interested."
3,TYPICAL BUT GOOD,"I READ THIS BOOK IN ABOUT TWO DAYS. IT MOST DEFINITELY PULLS YOU IN. I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR COULD DO A BETTER JOB AT CREATING MORE WELL ROUNDED CHARACTERS THOUGH. IT BASICALLY REVOLVES AROUND THE SAME STORYLINE. GIRL MEETS BAD BOY, BOY DOES DIRT & GOES TO JAIL, GIRL LEFT STANDING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH HER LIFE. DON'T GET ME WRONG I LIKE A GOOD READ WHICH THIS WAS, BUT ADD A LITTLE TWIST TO MAKE IT STAND OUT AGAINST OTHERS."
2,A Real book reader knows a good book....,"True to the game was definitely hyped up. I mean, okay, first I'll give the author props on writing a book cause we do need more black authors, but it was poorly written with alot of mistakes that a good publishing company should have corrected. Second, the author added too many characters that you really couldn't keep up with. Thirdly, she didn't even describe any of the characters really. If you are an Omar Tyree, Sistah Souljah, or Eric J. Dickey fan DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK!! Because that means you are used to the author describing the characters to the tee; where you can actually visualize them in your head. This author doesn't do this and you will get frustrated trying to keep up. The storyline was weak also; like she just got tired of writing. The people that hype this book up usually don't read on a regular basis anyway so of course they don't know a good book when they read one. Thats why I said a real book reader knows a good book."
1,true blue - a waste of money,"The book, read like a urban newspaper! Nothing in the book was any different than what we see and hear from the news that is reported every night! The author has to be under 21, the flow was from that of a teenager! This was a waste of time and money, Can I get a refund."
4,an emotional rollercoaster,"true to the game was amazing. it was truly emotional the way things turned out in this book. i started crying when it got to the part with her in the hospital with Quadir because it was such a realistic scene. the whole book made you feel like you were talking to your cousin or somebody around your way, because we all know somebody who was, or still is, in the ""game""!"
1,Only ... in this game,"Teri woods true to the game is the ABSOlUTE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! This book glamorizes and glorifies the life of the hustler and the hoochie. None of the characters have any depth and the book has no sense of realism. The teenage girls seem to live in a fantasy world of men and money, and the guys seem to think hustling is the only way of life to live. There is nothing real about this. It's all pretty sad. I expected better. Pick up dopefied by Donald Goines or Pimp by iceberg slim those books show you what the ""game"" really is."
4,i really liked it.,"let me just say this, i finished this book in 3 hours! it was a good book, the characters were real and most of all Quadir was the joint! i also read the coldest winter ever and the two were alike in alot of ways but i must say i think the coldest winter ever was just a lil better. true to the game was a real down to earth book. i think many people can relate to the characters and also just how much Gena loved Q and all the things he could provide for her also. Red was funny as hell and i think we all somewhere down the line run into a ""Red"". All in all i enjoyed the book and was very much in love with Q!!! i read another review and someone said that they wanted gena to be pregnant and i felt the same way, just so she could have something that belonged to Q. i won't give out n e more info on the book but just know that i found it to be good and i hope terri comes out w/ a sequel."
1,TRUE TO THE GAME/TERRI WOODS,"THIS BOOK WAS FOR A YOUNG ADULT OF MAYBE 18YRS OR 19YRS OLD!! ONE WHO FOR SURE DOES KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF STREET LIFE IN THE GHETTO. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GHETTO MIGHT THINK THIS IS WHAT THE GHETTO IS ALL ABOUT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK TO LAY BACK, RELAX, AND READ. THE BOOK WAS AS TERRIBLE AS THEY GET. I AM NOT FROM THE GHETTO, BUT I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE, AND BELIEVE ME I THINK THEIR STORIES WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER NOVEL. I SUGGEST TERI WOODS TRY AGAIN AND NEXT TIME LEAVE GHETTO LIFE ALONE!"
2,The Book That Started (but should have Finished) It All,I am so GLAD that I borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it. I would have been very disappointed. So much stuff was happening that I couldn't figure it out. The scenes would change out of nowhere. I do not see why there were so many 5*** reviews. I couldn't see it at all. I gave it two *s because there was some GREAT potential here but in my opinion I don't think the author played the plot out very well. *This book could have been WAYYYY better.*
1,What's the point?,"So if you meet the drug dealer of your dreams you get to have a house in the suburbs with white leather furniture! WOO HOO! And then when he is killed you reevaluate your life and realize it wasn't worth it (but you still keep his drug money as you run away). Poorly written. Underdeveloped characters. If this is the ""truth"" give me some fiction!"
2,Just okay,"I read this book on the recommendation of friends who claimed it was as good as The Coldest Winter Ever. NOT! Don't get me wrong, the book definitely had the potential to be a good story, but I think it needed a whole lot more character development and a little less characters. It also could've used better editing to make the flow of the story go a little smoother. It was kind of hard to follow because new characters just popped up outta nowhere w/ a storyline that led nowhere. Like I said, all in all, the story itself was good, I just think it was poorly written. I would recommend it to be read, but if you're a seasoned reader, you might not be as satisfied when you finish."
3,It was solid,"This was an ok book. I had first heard about it on the Queen Latifah show and I really wanted to get it, but all the hype around it sorta disapointed me. It is nothing to compared to Coldest Winter Ever, that book was raw and I still read that book over and over again to remind me how it really it. so i paid my little 15 dollars for it, it was pretty good, little confusing, some parts I had to skip, but all and all, solid. I think what she shoulda done was have something really bad happen to gena so girls reading this book could get a better impact. Yeah all those people got shot up and Qua died, but all Gena did was take all that dirty money and fix up their projects. But what I did learn was that, some girls...... are really stupid. good read for girls who think they know everything.........."
4,True to Life,"""True to the Game"" is an exciting book you just can't seem to put down. Taking you back in history to the life and times of many characters living in the ghetto of Philly. This book shows the true meaning of love,violence, and the affects they have on people afterwords. If there were ever a book that kept you on the edge of your seat, this is definitely the one. I truly reccomend it to anyone who has ever been in Love!"
2,It was JUST OK,Ok so I have read sooooo much controversary on Teri Woods and all of her books and the different authors I decided I would read this one to see what people where talking about. I have read all the Dutch series and the Deadly Regns but this one I just couldn't get into. It makes me wonder who wrote what because this book just didn't do it for me.
1,cant read it,This book is super tiny I can't read the words...totally pissed. Amazon sent the same book after I explained that it was the small book and not the regular 5 by 7 book
3,O.K. BUT NOT WORTH ALL THE HYPE,"I JUST FINISH READING THIS BOOK, IT WAS O.K. I DID NOT SEE WHAT ALL THE HYPE WAS ABOUT. THERE WAS ALOT ACTION BUT THE ENDING WAS NOT THAT GREAT. THE PLOT WAS O.K. AND THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN WELL, BUT I GOT BETTER READ FROM B-MORE CAREFUL THEY BOTH ON THE SAME STYLE BUT WITH A LITTLE TWIST"
4,IT WAS GOOD,well it wasn't as good as everyone made it seem but none the less it was good. It's title is exactly what it means forever stay true
5,So good,"I recommend this book to anyone that just wants to read a good book. This book was well written. This book included all aspects of the game from being up to being down to having it all to having nothing. I think that was really important to me. At one point in the book I was thinking man that would be nice to have then as I kept reading and I realized its not worth it. I believe alot of teenagers should read this book. I know it made me look at things in a different light. ""Remeber everything your mother told you about that life.......its all true"""
5,Very Good Product,"The rubbermaid 6032ARWHT Antimicrobial Large Dish Drainer was as is desribed with its picture. It holds well under heavy pots and pans. Can fill it up with a lot of dishes! If you need a new a brand new dish rack, this Rubbermaid one is the right one!"
5,Good Product,These drainers are very useful. Thay can accommodate lots of utensils. The utensils dry faster on the drainers. Huge dinnerware can also be placed in it.Good product.
2,Are you sure this product is really manufactured by rubbermaid?,I took my new dish drainer out of the box; right away I could see and feel the difference in quality. The product is much lighter than the Rubbermaid dish drainer I am replacing; one I used for almost thirteen years. As matter of fact I had to bend the new one back into shape. The flatware holder is not as deep as I am used to. I am a little concerned about its functionality. I have not used the drainer but I will soon find out if it can stand up to the weight of the dishes.The quality is not the same as other purchases but it does the job and I am happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect for my double sink!,"I bought this to put in one side of my double sink to put dishes to be washed. Since it's just me, I don't use a dishwasher and this is great to place rinsed off dishes that need washing. The utensil holder is small and frankly, I just use it to hold my sponges. No issues thus far!"
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!!!","I purchased this as a replacement for one I had had for several years, as Rubbermaid has always been a quality product to me I purchased a Rubbermaid....boy, what a difference...this is very, very cheesey, flimsy plastic....not at ALL like the old one I had.....I almost went and got it out of the dumpster when I saw this one, I had the other one at LEAST 12 years, I don't see this one lasting much past 1 or 2 if that, the silverware basket is small and keeps moving...all in all I am very, very disappointed in this product and would not buy another one!"
4,dish drain,"It does was it is suppose to, drain dishes. It does tip if there is uneven weight. Like glasses on only 1 side."
1,Don't waste your money for 1 year of service,"I actually just got online to find a replacement to THIS dish drainer! It's amazing to me that this is the #1 seller on Amazon - it's garbage! Some of these reviews are from years ago, so perhaps the design has since been changed. I moved into my current apartment in April 2009 and the rusting started on this thing a month ago, so it lasted all of 15 months. I've cleaned it religiously, so there's no reason for rust or any poor wear and tear. I can't even imagine what would have happened had I used this for a whole household of people - this drainer served just myself!I'll gladly spend more so that I have one that lasts years."
4,For those who don't think dish drainers should grab your attention...,"Well, this is your typical square Rubbermaid dish drainer, but I love the black color, and it's nice to know it's anti-microbial. Stainless steel seems so popular now, but in my small kitchen it would tend to become the focal point."
1,Made for our Throw Away World...4 month lifespan!,"After two months of light use, small spots of rust appeared through the black, vinyl coated wire. Another two months and the dishrack was leaving rusty stains on any dish it touched. My first thought was that this flaw was an isolated one, considering the company RUBBERMAID used to be. When I called the company directly, the rep said, ""it happens"" and offered a check of 10.00 toward the purchase of another. Eight weeks later...no check...no response from Rubbermaid. So buy their products with the knowledge you're buying junk, and the company is laughing all the way to their bank, which is probably overseas. Good Luck!"
3,Not your mother's dish drainer,"I bought this to replace an older drainer. This one is flimsier, the wire in the rack is thinner. The basket for the silverware is badly designed, I should have saved the one from my old rack. Other than that, it's functional. That's about all I can say. Considering I couldn't find one in any store, I guess I'm lucky to get this."
3,Poorer construction than older model,"I bought this to replace an older Rubbermaid dish rack. The material (coated wire?)is thinner than it used to be. This is better for glasses - as the rack more easily bends to accommodate them, but overall it just feels less sturdy. Additionally I really dislike the redesign of the silverware holder. There is now a hole in the rack itself - for the holder - that was unnecessary, poorly placed and is too big - I find that dishes fall through it."
1,very poor quality,trying to replace one I have that is some years old amazed atthe poor quality of the products made today
1,Atrocious design defect caused glass to break,"This dish rack has a monumentally stupid design defect, namely (a) that the cutlery drying container blocks a giant hole in the wire of the rack (b) it is very easy for the cutlery container to slide over so that it unblocks the giant hole. Through which a glass just now fell and broke and covered my kitchen floor with nasty little fragments of broken glass.If the designer had a lick of sense in his/her air filled brain, he/she would have spent 2 more cents on putting wire to cover the giant hole.I had a well designed earlier version of this Rubbermaid dishrack made of heavier, stiffer wire and that had a sensible cutlery drying container, but that rusted out after about 10 years use. I wish Rubbermaid would revert to that earlier design, and get rid of this flimsy atrocity."
2,Not the Same Quality As in the Past!,"Not a good purchase. Compared to my last Rubbermaid dish drainer, this one is very light in weight and not near as sturdy. My last Rubbermade dish drainer was made in the US (2-3 year ago). This one is not (China) which could be why the quality has went down. The matching drainer isn't any better either. Still debating on whether or not to return both pieces."
3,New Drainer not quite as good as old design..,"We used on of these for years and it finally lost it's shape...ordered the new one seen here and it is almost identical to the old one EXCEPT it isn't made to allow the lip to drain over the edge of the sink trim, and into the sink, like the old one did...it is about 3/8"" to 1/2"" too short and water occasionally doesn't make it into the sink. It makes small puddles at either side of the drainer on the counter top, adjacent to the sink trim....So, we have stuck a 3/4"" board under the outboard edge and pushed the drainer lip out over the sink...it doesn't stay in place real great but it does drain into the sink now...wish they had left the design alone...it was much better before..."
2,Rubbermaid Large Dsh Drainer White,The drainer is to open in the front things fall out the front should have been closed like the back. the one I have now is also a bubbermaid about 20 years old has been a very good drainer.was disappointed in this one.Donna Horton
2,You get what you pay for.,"I'm very disappointed. It is flimsy, the utensil cup is not sturdy enough and slips constantly, the drain board that is offered drains does not really drain, doesn't slant very much. I had to put a cutting board under to lift it enough for it to drain. All and all not worth the money."
5,My Little Red Dish Drainer!,"I purchased this because of its color and size. I live a mobile lifestyle in a travel trailer. This drainer is perfect! My kitchen is red, red... and I love this drainer. The size is great, not just for my smaller sink, but also stores away with ease. The cupboards are typical of an RV... much smaller than a normal kitchen. But this thing fits GREAT under my sink. I just love my little red dish drainer!"
4,Great product!,"I absolutely love this product & could only find it at Amazon & the price was right. Good, sturdy, black dish drainers are hard to find in stores."
5,Very pleased,"As described, just the right fit in one side of my double sink. I would buy another without any hesitation."
1,Ain't what it used to be!,"I have always bought Rubbermaid products. So when I needed to replace my ""light teal"" dish drainer & tray set, I turned to Rubbermaid once again. Microban might be great, but give me the old style dish drainer & tray! Rubbermaid ""ain't what it used to be""! I bought this item because the large one drains from the long side & will not fit on my sink. This one doesn't drain into my stainless steel drop-in sink. I needed to prop up the back side with a piece of lumber since my existing wire angle frame is too big for this unit. I found this way too small for my pots. I have since replaced it with a Sterilite large combo drainer & tray. The wire rack fits the Sterilite unit with some modification & works great. I don't recommend this item except for travel-trailers & motor homes."
5,Serves it's purpose,"These dish drainers are great. They are made tough, and can withstand the weight of most of my dishes. They are no cons to this products I ordered simple-to-use, durable dish drainers, and that's what I got."
4,I Ike it,Rubbermaid definitely has decreased the quality compared to the one I replaced which was about 25 years old. Love the color
2,Cheaper design.,"I recently bought this to replace my previous, 15-year old Rubbermaid dish drainer, which I loved, but which had gotten rusted. This one is not the same design as the previous one. On the original, there was a strip of wire that ran horizontally around the basket, about one inch from the bottom. This strip kept glasses above the edge of the counter. The new design is flimsier and less sanitary, with the edge of the glasses resting on the counter. You also need to be more careful putting the glasses on the prongs on the side, as they could drop against the edge of the counter and crack."
1,Item not as shown - Customer Service a joke!!,"I ordered this Rubbermaid 6032-AR-Wht Dish drainer because it was one of the few that had a large opening, corner silverware drainer. When the item arrived, it was the typical narrow slotted drainer that is nearly impossible to get the silverware in without them falling out. I tried calling the company - but got a foreign-speaking person and was able to figure out it was the shipping dept. I tried the customer service number and was told no one was available to take my call. I paid a total of $17.00 plus in order to get the model pictured in the amazon site, and now, if I want to return it, I have to pay the shipping PLUS a 10 - 25% restock fee!Do NOT buy from this ""Toolboxsupply.com"" unless you want a one way trip with your 'disposible money'.I buy an unbelievable amount of merchandise through Amazon.com and this is the first vendor I've ever been 100% dissatisified with."
1,Does the designer of this actually WASH dishes?,"For some reason they left a GAPING HOLE where the silverware basket hangs on the NEW dish drainer.In the photo you see they don't show the end of the basket that has a GAPING HOLE.I tried using my old corner silverware basket with this drainer, but the dishes fell out of the BIG GAPING HOLE at the other end of the basket.The new silverware basket DOESN'T hold the silverware up, and it DOESN'T keep the dishes from falling out of the GAPING HOLE in the dish drainer.WHO is designing dish drainers? Do they actually WASH dishes?"
1,Yich!,"Hate it, hate it, hate it. Nothing larger than a teaspoon or small fork will stay in the cutlery container without easily falling out of the top, and after a couple of years the rubber coating on the rack starts to crack and the rust starts to show. I've been annoyed by Rubbermaid products, and particularly this dish drainer, since 1971, so this isn't a brash review. Do yourself a favor, pay the price and buy a fantastic dish rack on Amazon.com like the simplehuman KT1025 System Dish rack (pricey but worth every dollar) or OXO Good Grips stainless dish rack and sink mats. Their designs are attractive and will blend with any décor, and they are well made and will last for years. The money you save now on the Rubbermaid product will soon be spent on frequent replacements and on aspirin for the headaches this cheap piece of garbage causes."
2,oh my,"The same complaints I mention with the drain board apply here- hard to scrub black marks will appear all over this dish drainer due to frequently getting wet because it's made of rubber, and the odds are pretty good that once these black marks appear you won't be able to eliminate them. You may make the dish drainer look better by routinely scrubbing it, but it's almost guaranteed there will still remain black stains all over it. This problem can easily be avoided by going with a plastic dish drainer instead. Please do that."
2,some annoying problems,"I bought this a couple of years ago and it rusted. Also kept getting slimy gunk around the legs. Didn't like the way the glasses were held on the side, they dipped down on to the counter. The utensils wrack is small. Why do dish wracks always rust in a year or two? Shouldn't they be made to resist rusting--aren't they suppose to be made to put wet dishes in?!"
3,No silverware cup,"I received the product and there was no detachable silverware cup as the product description claimed. Dish rack is fine, just need to figure out what to do with silverware."
2,Rubber Peeling Off,"I ordered this two years ago. I had no problem with it until about three months ago, at which time I observed that the thin red rubber covering was peeling off the wires. Af first, it was hardly noticeable, but now it's time to discard it. I had no issues with this product until this started to happen so I'm giving it two stars. I really expected more from a Rubbermaid product. In conclusion I wouldn't buy it."
5,great shape and easy to organize,It has good size to organize and I think it won't be corroded.Small spoon basket is useful to dry spoons or forks.
3,Should have picked up at the grocery store!,"I love Amazon for several reasons, convenience, rapid delivery, competitive pricing, you know what I mean.When my dish drain broke a few weeks ago it seemed like the natural thing to do was dash in and order a new one while it was on my mind.Well, I apparently became confused when the large black drain was available, but the large white was not and the Amazon program redirected me to the small white drain.Since I was in a hurry and did not pay close attention, I mistakenly ordered the small white instead of the large. Given the price, I would have done better picking it up onmy next trip to the grocery store.So...not worth the price for the small one."
4,No...it's not as heavy as the old model....,"...but it is a well-made dish drainer with lots of space for dishes, cups, glasses, bowls, utensils, and the like.I bought the large model to replace a no longer needed dishwasher, and I am happily running my dishes through quickly and getting out of the kitchen. Both good things.I do agree with the other reviewers about the new silverware basket; it's not as convenient as the older design....my smaller pieces of silver need to be placed carefully to remain upright and dry spot free...but that's a quibble. Rubbermaid still makes the best dish drainer on the market....especially for those of us holdouts who prefer to hand wash their dishes."
4,Red dish rack,Was exactly as pictured. I needed a small one because I keep it in one side of my double sink. It's perfect for one or two people. The good thing is it came with two flatware holders. I can keep knives separate.
4,Serves the purpose,"Have been using this for about 3 months now. It is quite good. The gap between the spoon holder and the drainer is a little big, making some small things slip out. Very useful and helps reduce clutter when there are many dishes to dry."
4,Dish Drainer,"I purchased this product to replace another one that had worn out. I thought the new one was the same, as the photos looked the same and they are made by the same company. However, the new one is considerably flimsier though it does the job intended."
2,"Not the same quality as previous model, poor design too!!","This is much lower quality than any Rubbermaid dishrack I've ever had. It's flimsier, and I only had it one day when the rubber film ripped at one end. The idea to make a big hole for the really, really hokey silverware caddy is awful. You can't use the space for anything but the stupidly designed caddy, because taking it off leaves a big gap. I'm thinking I'm going to get my old one back, scrub it up again, and use it, instead of this disappointing item. I always knew what I was getting with Rubbermaid before. No longer. I will never order their products unless I see them in person."
4,"People, it's a DISH DRAINER","I don't really understand some of these extremely emotional negative reviews. It is a DISH DRAINER people. It's not going to change your life. It's sturdy and spacious. I have no problems at all with the silverware staying it the basket it comes with (and it holds plenty of silverware, which includes measuring spoons, forks, knives, and spoons). It holds a LOT of dishes, glasses and cookware. Yes there is a space on the end near where the basket goes. This is where you would place a large glass or something that can't fall through. Pardon the french, but ""duh."""
3,Sufficient,"Product is sufficient for the use. However, this one is much lighter than the one it replaced."
1,Look elsewhere!,"Hate it, hate it, hate it. Nothing larger than a teaspoon or small fork will stay in the cutlery container without easily falling out of the top, and after a couple of years the rubber coating on the rack starts to crack and the rust starts to show. I've been annoyed by Rubbermaid products, and particularly this dish drainer, since 1971, so this isn't a brash review. Do yourself a favor, pay the price and buy a fantastic dish rack on Amazon.com like the simplehuman KT1025 System Dish rack (pricey but worth every dollar) or OXO Good Grips stainless dish rack and sink mats. Their designs are attractive and will blend with any décor, and they are well made and will last for years. The money you save now on the Rubbermaid product will soon be spent on frequent replacements and on aspirin for the headaches this cheap piece of garbage causes."
4,Nice. Big.,"That sums it up. Nice. Big. Holders for glassware. Just wish it INCLUDED a rubber mat rather than having to order, and wait, for a separate item."
4,Antimicrobial is nice,"After years of using, old one was pretty much out of shape, but I could not find the same large size locally. Finally found one on Amazon, but newer model's wire is thin. Antimicrobial is nice and keeps it clean."
5,Good book,I bought this book for a class I was taking but I didn't really use the book that much in class. Overall the book is good and was shipped fairly quick.
1,Promotional reference material.,"Ugh!!!! This book is very repetitive... it seems as if they just used cut and paste(d) different cultural group names in some chapters to others leaving most of the same text. There should have been an introduction chapter saying all groups have this in common and then separate chapters emphasizing only on the differences. Also, I have never read any book with so many quotes and references from sources that wished to remain anonymous. It made it seem more like people complaining than having actual factual situations to back up the comments."
1,Multicultural Law Enforcement,The worse book I have ever read. This book is filled with Liberal jibberish and worthless information that the authors try to pass off as fact. This 500+ page masterpiece is loaded with unfactual opinions from people who know absolutely nothing about Police work. It could have been explained in 50 or less pages. Don't waist your money!!!!!
5,Good insight into how police must consider community culture,"Authors give insightful ideas on how to police witha variety of different cultures now facing America.The book offers almost a ""how-to"" for Departmentsconsidering a need to implement a more culturallysensitive process for their city. Cultures consideredinclude the obvious African American, Hispanic, Asian,Indian as well as ""lifestyle"" cultures."
2,WARNING,"The editorial review neglects to mention the item is very sexually explicit with graphic depictions that are very detailed. The overall story is amusing and the drawing is well done. I especially enjoyed the representation of the fates; however, if you are ordering for a library or school facility's graphic novel order you may want to make sure you are ready for the parent/ administrative complaints."
3,SECOND TIMES A CHARM,"After a lackluster start, Styx is back with their follow up cd Styx 2. This time writing their own songs, and John C. singing on the two songs that he wrote, A Day, and You better ask. Both good songs, with the first, with the first containing a very good instrumental in the middle.But the star of this cd is Dennis. Writing five of the six songs, and handling vocals on two of them. Dennis started it all right here, with a song called Lady. Not a hit a first, but a couple years after the release of this cd, it would be a top ten hit, their first of many.Father O.S.A. the other song that Dennis has lead vocals on is a prelude of songs to come for the group (Madame Blue, etc).JY isn't to be counted out, handling vocals on You Need Love and the rocker I'm Gonna Make You Feel ItStyx showed life on this cd, long before anyone really knew them."
4,America's early 1970's answer to YES and E.L.P.,"It's interesting to listen to this collection of embrionic Styx again. I vividly recall having the Styx II album played for me at college in late 1973. Anyone that was enamoured by early 70's British prog-rock like Yes and ELP liked Styx when they first heard them. In 1973, many FM radio stations in the Midwestern United States gave airplay to three tracks from Styx II...... ""I'm Going To Make You Feel It"", ""Little Fugue in G / Father O.S.A"" and of course the beautiful ballad ""Lady"". Listeners in the Midwestern states heard ""Lady"" on the radio about five years before it became a huge hit across the U.S. in the late 70's."
3,Styx's sophomore album is at least half good,"This is the best of Styx's pre-stardom quartet of albums originally released in the early 1970s on a now-defunct label. In fact, it contains the song ""Lady,"" a lovely ballad that would become a delayed hit several years later and launch the band's success. This is the best early Styx album because it is also the most Chicago-centric, featuring the song ""Earl of Roseland,"" which is about as close to true sentimentality as Styx ever gets. A couple of other songs are also interesting, though there is a lot of dated overblown art rock pretention here as well. If you must hear Styx's early stuff, this is the best album on which to do so."
2,Not The Deepest,"Sometimes, when covering a certain kind of song, it always needs to have a bit improvement, or the original version seems to take the cake. That does come with the case for Sheryl Crow. She hasn't provided any heavy covers among any of her albums, but there is always the chance to add on for the hitting parades. Her cover of the Cat Stevens classic, The First Cut Is The Deepest really is one of the few lackluster songs that Sheryl Crow has ever done. Although it is nice for the die hard Sheryl Crow fan, it doesn't seem to the actual chemistry that Rod Stewart had conjured when he did it back in the 70's. Unfortunately, it was done in two different versions by Sheryl, and neither of them had a certain chemistry, very rarely said for a Sheryl Crow Track. Hopefully, she can make a better cover song soon."
3,Different Flag Received Than Shown Here,"The flag pictured on Amazon is not the one that I received in the mail. Instead of the USA Presidential Flag, I received the Seal of the United States of America flag. The manufacturer did respond to my email and credited my account.It's a shame that this type of flag is not available as shown otherwise I would have purchased it.There is no rating for the flag because I never received the correct one, however in order to send this review I had to rate the item. So I am basing my rating on the manufacturer's response which was very good."
4,Golden Voice of Miss D,"Dinah Washington's old songs still have her golden touch in this CD. I remembered her from hearing that tune on the TV ad, Relax Jack. Wonderful voice and great variety."
2,quality lost,"The quality of Dinah Washington's voice come over very well on the Doubletree television ad, but not at all on the CD track, as is the case with all popular singers, including Linda Ronstadt. The original timbre of the voice is not there.What a Diff'rence a Day Makes!"
2,real kickboxing,I didn't find the video to be as high energy as I hoped. There is too much time inbetween moves. The voice of the person instructing the sequence of moves during the workout is very irritating - I wish that wasn't on the workout at all! It makes it very hard to listen to.It's a good workout but not what I expected.
3,Fun kickboxing combinations but overpriced,"I've been taking kickboxing classes at various gyms and martial arts studios for many years now so I really appreciate kickboxing combinations that are challenging. Real Kickboxing Bag workout offers these types of combinations. Also, I like the format that the workouts are in. They are arranged in 2 min rounds. So, for 2 mins, you can work at your own pace doing the different combinations (which is good for both advanced and beginner kickboxers). However, only the intermediate and advanced workouts are worth using again and again. So, for the price, I'm not happy with the amount of actual instruction contained in this set."
2,Too slow,"For someone who is in advanced kickboxing classes, these DVDs, particularly the advanced, were just way too slow. Too much instruction and not enough kick time."
5,It's THE smile book of the decade.,"The fringe (elements) should cringe when reading this book. A laugh, a smile, a tear, a pensive thought. What else could one ask of a tale. Oh, how I wish the events could or would really happen.Thank you, Mr. Bechard, for a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking tale."
5,A Gem of a Book!,"I bought this book several years ago in the bargain bin (apologies to the author!) of a local bookstore. I daresay that was the best $4.99 I've ever spent on a work of fiction!The story of Ilona Ann Coggswater is dry, funny, heartwarming and addictive-- I've re-read the book every summer, and will probably continue to do so for many years. The plot-- which seems fantastical at first, but hey, why can't a teenage girl be the daughter of God?-- is superbly laid out, and the writing is on the money. And attention, bleeding-heart liberals: you'll find more fights for your causes in this book than in an edition of ""The Bleeding-Heart Liberal Review."" (A wonderful addition to the intelligent, thought-provoking plot, in my point of view.)Overall, one of my favorite books-- a must-buy."
5,One of my all-time favorites (and I read a lot)!,This is how people should feel about religion! I can't believe this was written by a man - it certainly feels like a woman's point of view. My husband and daughter also read it and both fell in love with it. My daughter also ranks it in her top 10. I wish it was still available in print - I'd buy copies for everybody!!
5,Heavenly!,"I loved this book. Some publishing house really needs to pick this one up and reprint it. I've been in Libraryland for a long time, and this is one of those books that stays with you. I'd love to see a sequel; how about it Gorman?"
2,Like Owen Meany?,"Warning! This book is nothing like Owen Meany. Where as Owen Mean was a well written fable, this book shows Bechard to have none of the wit that Irving possesses."
5,"Second Greatest... Shoots High, Hits Mark","In Bechard's first book (as well as in the similar follow-up, Balls), he turns our understanding of gender politics upside-down. By placing women in positions previously unfamilar to us and them, he has created an often funny (and sad) look at the world we live in. Ilona, the daughter of God, is the most refreshing character in recent fiction memory; only the most jaded person would not root for her. This breezy satire never fails to make the reader laugh, think and, more importantly, feel. Although difficult to locate because of its ""out of stock indefinitely"" status, this is one book that is well worth the extra effort to find. Bravo, Mr. Bechard. I impatiently await your next novel."
4,This book needs to be reborn,"This is a delightful and very funny story of God sending down His daughter this time to save the world. One of her first miracles is to make Tab come out of the water fountains at school.I read this book when it first came out and heard from someone who claimed to know the author that he was in talks to sell the movie rights, but refused when producers wanted Whoopi Goldberg to play Ilona. The author wanted Michelle Pfeiffer. Interesting.If you're in the mood to laugh at the stuffiness in religion (this Christian did not find it blasphemous at all) then you will laugh and cry with this book. This book needs renewed exposure and a rebirth in light of the current attitudes toward making fun of religion. Let there be light!"
3,gentran r3020 transfor switch,"on first receiving this product I thought in was good . while the electrician was installing it and jiggling the lugs for the main feedlines, 1 of the screws that hold the breaker fixture fell out. Trying to tighten it back up he found out it was stripped and would not tighten."
5,Most beloved book,Why oh why oh why hasn't Scholastic republished this most wonderful book? Does anybody know? Libraries can't replace their copies and I can't afford $70 or more for a good quality copy. This is a great loss for children.
5,A unique and fun style of scary story,"I have purchased this book for my neices usually around Halloween time.It is a book not many have heard of, but always enjoy.Tracy"
5,Funny and well written,"This book by the Magic School Bus author is really fun to read. It is a russian fairy tale of a witch named Bony Legs who likes to eat children. The story is about a little girl who escapes because of all the good deeds she has done to help others -- a cat, a dog and a gate. My kids (5 and 3 years) really enjoyed it."
5,One of my Childhood Favorites is now my Son's,"My mom bought me this book at an Elementary School book fair. My three year old asks to be read this book almost every night. He giggles everytime the witch ""stamps her feet, pulls her hair and pinches her nose""."
4,Bony legs,"I had this book when I was in grade school,15 years ago. I have since bought a new copy, and passed it on to my 8 yr. old step-son and my 4 yr. old daughter. Although it is a little scary for younger kids, as it refers to bony-legs liking to ""eat little children,"" it is enjoyable, and simple enough to explain to kids that its just pretend. My step-son enjoys reading the book outloud to himself, and my 4 yr old loves to have it read to her almost every night. In my opinion, there really is no moral to the story, it is just a simple, fun, children's book that brings out there imagination."
5,Great book!,Our Kindergartener has threatened to steal this from the library. We figured we'd just buy it instead!
4,"Meagan Hatfield reviews Gothic romance, Dark Desires","Eve Silver has written a breakout debut novel!Dark Desires is a wonderful, sensual, thrilling Gothic romance. I'd forgotten how much I love this genre, until I read Eve's book!It tells the story of a young, destitute woman who almostfalls victim to the murderer prowling the streets of Whitechapel. But she escapes, and finds employment with ahandsome, yet strange doctor. The time they spendtogether becomes wrought with sexual tension. However,when she sees him leave his lab covered in blood, shebegins to wonder if perhaps she hadn't gotten so far awayfrom the killer afterall.Oohh...I get goosebumps just reading that! This is agreat read to curl under the covers with on some lonely,stormy night."
5,WINNER! We have a winner here!,"In a word this one is a WINNER! I keep collections, and I noticed this Zebra debut line is a collection. I have the entire one. I read them and loved them - some more than others, and I have to tell you, Ms. Silver can write! This book is such a complete gothic delight that I finished it and looked at the cover in wonder. And then I started reading it again. I read this book twice in one sitting, cover-to-cover. Ms. Silver has put together the perfect blend of shiver-inducing suspense, gorgeous-but-dark hero, and a heroine I'd have given anything to be. I disappeared. That's what I want from a romance. I want to disappear into it. That's why I wasn't going to write a review on any of these debut novels. I love them. All of them. I just find some of them to be extra-ordinary to the point that I'm awed. This is one of them. Give it a read. I dare you."
5,Wonderful Debut Gothic!,"Eve Silver has written a breakout debut novel!Dark Desires is a wonderful, sensual, thrilling Gothic romance. I'd forgotten how much I love this genre, until I read Eve's book!It tells the story of a young, destitute woman who almostfalls victim to the murderer prowling the streets of Whitechapel. But she escapes, and finds employment with ahandsome, yet strange doctor. The time they spendtogether becomes wrought with sexual tension. However,when she sees him leave his lab covered in blood, shebegins to wonder if perhaps she hadn't gotten so far awayfrom the killer afterall.Oohh...I get goosebumps just reading that! This is agreat read to curl under the covers with on some lonely,stormy night."
4,Dark Desriable Mystery,This is the type of historical/romance fiction that i enjoy reaading. It was a complete mystery straight til the end. WHen I read books like this I can usually guess who the killer is...not so. All the clues & hints were well hidden till the great revelation. Loved it. Eve Silver did a great research job. I felt like I was reading about Jack the Ripper the whole time. Thank Eve for the adventure!
3,Good CD,I enjoyed this CD even though some of the mixes of the songs were not the ones I was looking for when I purchased it.
