3,Bob Newhart's anthology is way better than this CD!,"What more can you get with some of all these tracks on this compilation import which they can be found on Rhino records own two-double CD set collection of ""Something Like This..."" a better choice. Don't get me wrong this is good and okay for listening to it here sometimes but everyone has an opinion on something what they like or don't dislike!"
5,play often.,"Interesting style of the artist, well played and I hope she does more playing. I have since bought two more of her offerings. Keep it up."
4,History,"A heartbreaker, but it's part of our human story and needed to be told. We need to know these things to remind us that , not only are we capable of great good , but , depending on events, great horror."
1,This fish is endangered and should not be purchased and eaten.,"It is very risky to eat this fish as it is an endangered species. There are other types of fish which are better to eat, and can help this fish species recover in numbers. We really don't want this fish to become extinct, as it is delicious and deserves a chance to survive. Please help by eating albacore, yellowfin or ahi, or other types of fish altogether. Check with the IUCN Red list to see if the fish you enjoy are sustainable and not endangered. Thanks!"
2,"Expected an IPA, got a light lager","The first half of this book reads like an undergraduate's attempt to puff up the word count of a weak thesis. My initial excitement at starting this tale quickly turned to disappointment as it became evident that I was being presented with a repetition of my 7th grade US history textbook with ""and there was beer there"" inserted willy-nilly into Constitutional Conventions and such.The book gains a bit more traction (and substance) as it enters the 19th century, and closes much stronger with a treatment of various issues (e.g. excise) that influenced the course of brewing history in the US. The author would have been better served by a more exacting editor.Readers looking for a serious treatment of early American brewing history should look elsewhere. Those looking to refresh their memory of the bare essentials of American colonial history while quaffing a pint might find this worth their while."
4,Great read.. grab a six pack and enjoy!,"I really enjoyed this book and I have a good reason why. I even gave it four stars, which means that I found it to be a really good book or I had ulterior motives. First off, it is non-fiction which almost garners a star just for being readable. What I really enjoyed about this book though is how it correlates with science. Beer is a healthy drink and water is poisonous. At first I was very dubious about this claim, but in light of how little people knew in 1600's, 1700's and 1800's the claim becomes quite plausible. Think about how complicated it is to brew beer. Yeast? They didn't even really know what yeast was. Medicine? Pre-Lister era. Machines? Steam engines appear eventually. Chemical reactions... during this time. It's really awesome seeing how this develops. This feature of the book makes up for the sections of the book where the author, G-Dog, just claims beer was a part of this important event because ... it was there."
2,Poorly focussed book on the role of beer in American culture,"This should be called America in Beer. Smith overrates the importance beer played in the dramatic events of US history. His thesis that beer played an everyday part in Colonial life is well-taken, if a bit obvious. More interesting is his history of the brewing industry, and discussion of historical brewing literature. He should have concentrated on these, and placed beer and brewing into a context of technological and cultural change, and ignored political context except as it specifically concerned alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, Smith's history knowledge rarely transcends the mundane textbook level -- and even that is outdated, relying all too often on analyses and interpretations that are decades old, and have long been superseded. Still, since there is no other book on the subject, and it is easy, even enjoyable reading (especially the fictional intros to each chapter -- I love those), it is an important work."
5,How can you NOT love this book?,"This is definitely a book that I would read over and over again. Phillip is the perfect tormented hero, and Eloise is the epitome of an independent, spirited heroine. I love all the books in the Bridgerton series, and this is definitely no exception."
3,Good read,"This is a great book in that it brings back the fantastic bridgerton family with all of their wit and warmth. The story has a more serious tone, but still has it's moments of hilarity. Eloise is a headstrong female that I have enjoyed following throughout the other books and I am glad that she is having her chance here. I just hope that the series will never end!"
4,Truly Entertaining!,"I really enjoyed this book! In my opinion, the characters were very well developed and endearing. I could really get a feel for who Eloise is, who Phillip is, and the situation in which they find themselves. There were also parts in the story where I found myself laughing out loud! It's a cute story!"
1,Not a page turner,"This book is so boring, I had to force myself to keep reading to se if it would improve, but it didn't. Sir Phillip is so boring, it makes it hard to believe she'd fall for him. Not a good read."
2,"Starts well, uneven after that","I'm new to Julia Quinn and not certain I care for highly for her storytelling. Her writing is captivating but her sense of romance leaves much to be desired.The story begins well with the letters from pen pals and awkward ""getting to know you"" period, but then fizzles into the cookie cutter romance format (the kind that dictates when certain love scenes must play out).The marriage is too hasty. The love scenes far from romantic. The relationship with the children is abandoned midway through the book, to be renewed 50 pages to the end and resolved quickly. And the HEA just don't feel earned. For pen pals who had been corresponding for a year, you expected them to be able to converse better and get to know each other on a much deeper level.I wanted to enjoy this story. It has one of the better beginnings I've red. Fantastic potential for a story, but Quinn seems to lose sight of her characters and only remembers them in the end."
4,You can't put it down,"To Sir Phillip, With Loveby Julia QuinnReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author of Home of the Braves trilogy)Eloise loves to correspond with everyone and anyone she can. Her adventure starts with a condolence letter sent to Sir Phillip Crane upon the death of his wife, her distant cousin. Alas, the heroine is faced with a cantankerous gentlemen and unpredictable twins when she unexpectedly arrives on his doorstep.Ms. Quinn keeps the reader going from page one until the very end. A storyteller in its truest form. Before I knew it, I was closing the book, wanting more. More, she has giving us with the Bridgerton series. Pick an adjective, any adjective and you will describe this excellent story. I can't wait, sitting on my bedside table, another Bridgerton story just waiting for me to read--It's in His Kiss."
4,Good book,"I guess this book got mixed reviews. It was one of my first by Quinn and first in the Bridgerton series. I thought the characters were not that believable, but liked them neverless. The one word that sums up the book was: cute. It was not deep, and was predictable. Sometimes it is nice to read a light book that just makes you go Ahhhh."
5,The best of the Bridgertons YET!,I have been falling in love with each of the Brigerton siblings one book at a time. This one was so far... my favourite. The darker edge to the story led to some page burning chemistry between the H/h. I'm so glad Eloise could find love after all of these years. I can;t wait to see what happens for Francesca!
2,Not at par with Bridgerton saga,"This book is the least-believable story in the Bridgerton series.In all the books we're told about the ton's propriety rules and how our heroes and heroines make sacrifices to meet those requirements. Whereas in this book we happen to meet the young woman defying all those rules and going far away on her very own to meet a man she had not even seen. This storyline could be possible with another heroine, but not a Bridgerton, imho. Being in a loving and caring family, with no pressing financial or social circumstances, and having been brought up with a sense of what is right, despite small issues of public defiance, should not, and possibly could not result in a young woman of the era to behave so foolishly.As for the man, Sir Phillip, I did not particularly think of him as an adorable hero or a good father either."
5,How I fell in love with the Bridgertons,"This was the first boook I read, since I obviously did not follow its order. But I am glad that I started with it. I loved it! Its sensual, mysterious, thrilling, and keeps you awake by a lamp turning pages :) Try it - I bet you will love it like I did!"
3,Sweet Love Letters,"To Sir Phillip with Love by Julia Quinn is Eloise Bridgerton story. This story starts where Romancing Mr. Bridgerton ends. Eloise takes off after Colin's engagement party to Sir Phillips home (who had asked her to marry via mail). This was not my favorite of the series but not every love story has to be grand. The Bridgerton series: #1: The Duke and I , #2: The Viscount Who Loved Me, #3: An Offer from a Gentleman, #4: Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, #5: To Sir Phillip, With Love, #6 When He Was Wicked #7: It's In His Kiss,#8: On the Way to the Wedding"
3,predictable,"I was so hoping this would've been on par with the other books in the Bridgerton series - I wish I would've gotten it used.The Further Oberservations of Lady Whisledown was superb as an ""in the meanwhile"" read..."
3,Nice Read...,"I thought this made for a decently romantic read. I enjoyed the ""snippets"" of Eloise's letters at the beginning of each chapter and I, like many other readers, thought the ""rescue"" scene was one of the best. I also enjoyed the way the children were used...their scenes with Eloise and their father were very natural and realistic. However, if anything, I would suggest you read the book for the romantic gesture Sir Phillip made towards Eloise at the ending of the book (hint: letter trail). I actually clutched the book to my chest and sighed. *laugh Maybe I'm just a romantic at heart but I thought it was so sweeeet. *smile A fairly enjoyable read."
2,Lacking unity,"The problem with this book is that it tries to balance some serious issues and characters - sir Phillip, widower with two children, who cannot relate to them and fears that he is not up to raising them - with classical romance stuff. While each part taken separately works, together they don't. Sir Phillip as he is described in the ""serious"" part of the book cannot be the same man that feels sexual passion for Eloise. He's just a scholar, he's dedicated to his work, and I cannot picture him as being at the same time a passionate guy.Also, perhaps I'm too outfashioned, but I found the multiple references to masturbation a little bit disturbing.Sincerely, I cannot see that these two characters could ever find something in common."
4,complex well-written relationship romance,"To Sir Phillip, With Love is written in Julia Quinn exceptional style, bringing the characters and story to life immediately. The drama that unfolds between the hero, Phillip, and the heroine, Eloise, is emotional, believable, and very well written. This isn't my favorite book of Julia Quinn but it still is wonderful. The author has a great gift in her ability to develop characters. This was another terrific romance from an author who has the ability to break down her characters souls and feed their emotional struggles onto the pages. I absolutely couldn't put the book down until I was finished. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Philip and Eloise in this very excellent character driven romance. I must say that the last quarter of the book was quite emotional, poignant and romantic. I even shed a few tears!"
3,"Not her best, try her earlier novels....","If you are a fan of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series, nothing I say will sway you. However, if you are new to Julia Quinn, than I suggest you try her earlier novels. This novel seems as if it was written in a rush to meet a deadline...the main characters are very uneven. A disappointmen to this Julia Quinn fan, who will go back to the beginning to remember why she was enchanting in the first place."
2,Disappointed,This book was very disappointing. I felt like I ordered whole milk and got nonfat. It wasn't as funny or interesting as her other Bridgerton books.
1,Boring!!!,This book was completely boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I'm just glad this one wasn't the first book I read by Julia Quinn or else I would never have picked up any of her others. I loved most of her other books though.
2,What can I say?,I love julia Quinn's books but this one it lacked something that the other Bridgeton stories had. Don't get me wrong parts of it were funny but once those parts were over the story dragged.
2,I couldn't put it down!,"Julia Quinn has done it again with another great Bridgerton book. A funny, delightful romance with a lovely, intelligent (if chatty) herione and a strong, attractive (if distant) hero. 'To Sir Phillip, With Love' is a humorous and sexy read. No one does historical romance better than Julia Quinn! Bravo, JQ!!!"
3,Very Plain....,"I know that I will not be interested with this premise. It's just plain, luckily I just borrow this book from my friend. Well, I read it coz this is part of the series, just a bit curious what will happen to Eloise.Actually I like the beginning of the story, but from middle the story degrading...maybe I just read too many wonderful books, then this is just an ordinary plain book for me.I love ""Bridgerton"" Family, seem that I want to be a part of them. I had read also from beginning, imo :Daphne's Romance - Good but not greatAnthony's Romance - GreatBenedict's Romance - WonderfulColin's Romance - Good but not greatThe next reading will be Francesca's - I haven't read it, but the premise seems promisingly great. Hope it will be."
3,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this lastest title in the Bridgerton series. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between Sir Phillip and Eloise, and there was no evolution of the story where we could see them falling in love. I did love when all the Bridgerton brothers showed up to threaten Sir Phillip, though. All in all, I was looking forward to this and it was a let down."
2,Kinda disappointed,"I anticipated the release of this book, because I have really enjoyed all the books in the Bridgerton series. However, I felt disappointed while reading this book. I'd have to say that this was my least favorite Bridgerton story. I wished there was more interaction among the main characters. A lot of the story is told through the character's thoughts and I just would've liked more dialogue. On a side note: Philip and Eloise had a lot of patience where his kids were concerned. I don't know how they did it. Those kids were TERRIBLE, but I guess thats Philip's fault since he ignored their existence. Honestly, did he need to be in that greenhouse 24/7? I don't know what Julia's plans are, but I hope she will be writing Gregory's story next."
4,For the love of Letters,Communicating through writing can lead to such an interesting tale of laughter and love. A must read!The characters are loveable and the storyline unique.
5,well worth the read,To Sir Phillip with Love is a book well worth reading. It has a hero and an heroine. The heroine Eloise has had several offers of marriage but has turned down all of them during her seasons. Through writing letters she meets Sir Phillip. It is a great book about the Bridgerton family.
2,Great prints...bad quality and price,"I was planning a safari themed baby shower for my sister and needed animal print wrapping paper for the prizes. Looking everywhere, I finally found it on amazon. Living in Canada, I had to pay about $25 in shipping totaling over $60 for this wrapping. I was expecting a great quality paper for this price, however was surprised to find it didn't have a nice wrapping paper finish, but it felt as though animal print had just been printed on regular paper. This made it difficult to wrap. I wish I could return it and get my money back :("
5,Fantasy,These videos were as advertised and arrived promptly. Movies are great to stimulate the imagination of the young.
1,I'm Not Buying This Crap...,"FOUR whole episodes... What is this, 1997?Sony has no concept of how to release a decent DVD.Look at how they recently treated the live action GB franchise with their crappy reissues and horrendous looking box art. They are completely clueless.When the release was first announced, I was prepared to pick this up on street date... until I found out the specs.Either send these properties over to your Classic Media division or auction them off to a more apt studio because save for the recent Pink Panther films and cartoons (which conveniently tie in to promote the new Steve Martin movie), your releases the past couple of years have been entirely insignificant."
1,"Who Ya Gonna Call? Not SONY, that's for sure.","Why?Why waste your time and money on producing crap?Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero."
5,Christiphor Timothy Brings Harriot To Life In This Video,"I thought this video, and the rest of the All Creatures Great and Small tapes were awsome. It really brought to life James Harriots tales to life in a perfect setting. Really enjoyable for the whole family."
3,"Buen espectaculo, no muy fiel a las versiones originales.","Estuve buscando un dvd sobre Miguel Mateos porque me gusta mucho su musica y sigo sus pasos desde hace varios años. Lamentablemente al ver el dvd en Amazon, no aparecian las canciones y si bien este dvd tiene canciones muy populares como ""Obsesion"", ""Atado a un sentimiento"", ""Es tan facil romper un corazon"", ""Con mi sombra en la pared"" y otras, las versiones son particularmente distintas a las originales. Sin embargo, a pesar de esto me parece un buen espectaculo y recuerdo de un maestro del Rock Argentino como es Miguel Mateos."
1,Not what it seems,"There are only 64 pages not 94 as the description says, they are not loose-leaf pages and the pages but are bound together and stapled and each page is perforated to tear out of the book. There is a big, obnoxious ""Mel Bay"" logo at the bottom of each page."
5,Buckeye is on a collision course with stardom!!,"In a nutshell, if I could put my money on one band - it would be Buckeye!!! Anyone dialed into the San Francisco music scene knows that these guys are unbelievably talented. Tracks like ""Dear Elaine"", ""Dusty Roads"", ""Lonesome Climber"" and ""Sweet Home High Lonesome"" are classic alt-country/rock. Check this out - you will not regret it."
5,Rock and Roll is back,"Brother Love is bringing back to music what has been missing for almost the last decade, heart and soul to their music. They have the classic rock edge, but also have the grittier alternative side. What you get is your monies worth with this new album."
3,Overrated foreign policy vista?,"Michael Mandelbaum - though having excelled at teaching-cum-academia - has really written a quite ordinary overview* of what long-term prospects will be like for American foreign policy. The first five chapters of his book tread no new water and what little is ventured into from chapter six is also bland or uninteresting at most.Though not an academic in my own right, I am sufficiently aware about what constitutes the chaff and the wheat in the U.S. foreign policy publishing field.I was sorry to learn that Mandelbaum's research was more re-search than a foray into depths a la Henry Kissinger(!), which is what I had HOPED to read.."
2,Whats the big DEal???,"I have no why everyoen in the world loved this cd when it came out. To me it was the biggest let down. Their last cd Greyest of blue skies was amazing, then this cd comes out and i am like wow 3 songs maybe i like. THis cd just felt like it did not flow and that finger elevn will always try to change there sound. Then they get one huge hit and everyone jumps on the bandwagon. I really have nothing else to say except jsut why do people think this cd is so good?? the only songs on here that are good, are good times, one thing, and conversations"
2,Jane Eyre missed the mark,"I have seen five different versions of Jane Eyre and this one was by far the worst. It was almost too painful to watch. Many things were changed and left out. The one thing that most upset me was the interaction bewteen Mr. Rochester and Jane. From what they presented it would be difficult to understand why the two fell in love in the first place. I recommend the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or even the 1973 BBC version with Sorcha Cusack and Micheal Jayston. The 1973 version is shorter, but it includes scenes that are missing in the 1983 version.Emma, however, was a well written adaptation. I had pleasure watching it, though it was rather short. This movie is the only reason that it got two stars. Emma would have recieved four or five stars from me, but Jane Eyre is on the negative scale. I suggest buying Emma seperatly."
3,DVD skipped,Received the DVD later than expected. When I played it there were several damaged spots on the DVD and my MAC player skipped over these areas.
4,"""Light"" Reading","This book was a really good light (a few stories made me want to keep the lights on) read and worth the money paid. I thought though that the some of the stories seemed too fantastic and unbelievable (Devil House), but then a good part of me is still skeptical about this kind of phenomena."
2,"not bad, not good but not bad",I felt this book was to much like other ghost story collections and really embelished a great deal of facts.
1,Not quite fitting the description.,"I bought this item to remove the in-line fuel filter from a 1998 Ford Explorer 4.0L SOHC.I got impression from the description that it was specifically for this purpose, however, when I attempted to use it, I discovered that it does not fit the interior of the locking collar it is supposed to release.Very disappointing, and as I live in the U.K., a very expensive error considering the cost of postage."
1,May work on some but not 1998 4.0 Ford Ranger,I bought this item to remove the in-line fuel filter from a 1998 Ford Ranger 4.0L SOHC.Supposedly it should work as advertised. Doesn't. It will not fit within the quick disconnect collar.
1,POORLY made and does NOT fit my Ford,This is supposed to fit Fords 1990 and newer. It does not fit my Ford.The quality is very poor. I believe the poor quality is the reason it does not fit.
3,Glad this book exists,I'm glad there is one more book that states with no uncertainty that homebirth is a safe and effective option for women. This book may be good for women interested in homebirth to share with others in their lives so they can be convinced it's right. I had the privilege of hearing the author speak at a conference after I read the book. His passion for normal birth is refreshing.
2,Where is the bibliography?,"I became quite frustrated with this book after a few chapters. Dr. Eisenstein must have plenty of experience to draw on, and must know the homebirth medical literature, but his book reads like a series of assertions with no hard evidence to back it up - no references to specific studies, statistics, etc. Also, his practice is one in which medical doctors attend homebirths. That is not an option in my area, though highly qualified Certified Nurse Midwives are. I did not find it very helpful to me in considering a homebirth with a CNM - not to mention in helping me prove to my near and dear that there is scientific evidence that homebirth is safe! Back to the medical journals and midwife websites..."
2,Worst Homebirth Book Ever,"This book and the Chicago based homebirth practice are insane! Yes, it does give great insights to the advantages of homebirth, and I am a strong supporter of homebirth however Dr. Eisenstein's practice is totally nuts! You might as well have your baby at a hospital because he's just bringing it to you. I don't know about you but bringing all that medical equiptment into my house would really hinder my birth experience, and with homebirth, that's what we want to get away from, right? This book completly ousts what homebirth is meant to be."
5,I Will Gar Nix Aber Di,If you like rock & roll combined with alpine music - these are the guys to go to.
1,"After 6 months, it's unusable!","I'm so disappointed with this bike after the positive reviews. I bought it based on these reviews. It's very flimsy and after just a couple of months developed a 'cranking sound' on every cycle! The seat and whole back portion cranks! I even got complaints from my neighbors! So much for the 'quiet' this bike promised. I bought this one to use when my baby was napping, and now 6 months later I'm left with a bike I cannot use because we cannot figure out where the noise is coming from!!The noise wakes up the baby so it's now useless.Last time I buy something like this from Amazon as the returns window was only a month after purchase and there is a restocking fee. The bike worked fine for the first month or so, before this noise started.So, if you are looking for a bike that will only last one month or two before falling apart or becoming terribly noisy, then it's for you!"
2,Misrepresented - Not Magnetic Resistance,The bike worked well for about 1 year. It is not silent. It is not magnetic resistance like in slightly more expensive exercise bikes. Wore this one out with a year's use.
4,Great bike for the price!,"The box the bike came in was mangled but the bike appeared to be in good shape. Fairly easy to assemble. The function of this bike is fantastic for the price! I have been using an upright bike for years and consider myself to be in good shape. This bike busts my chops! If you use the programs correctly, you will get a fantastic workout in a short period of time. Took one star away for pulse reading non-functional (don't care)heels occasionally brush the floor on revolution (but this could be because of thick carpet), and seat rocks slightly when pedaling fast.My mom owns a 450.00 Schwinn and I like this one better!"
1,bike broke less than 6 months after purchased,"For this price, I didn't expect gym quality. But I did expect it to last longer than four months. The left pedal never felt right when I put it together. And yes, the left pedal was on the left crank, not switched with the right. After a few months, the hole for the left pedal became completely stripped and the pedal would not stay in.I ordered a new pedal from Stamina. I will say that their replacement part prices aren't as exorbitantly over priced like Pro-forms. And the crank came in a reasonable amount of time. However, the old crank is impossible to get off. You apparently need superhuman strength or some special piece of equipment to get the bolts off.As it stands now, I've emailed Stamina for help. It will be interesting to see how good the customer service is.But I could have a $250 paperweight on my hands. Very disappointing."
1,You get what you pay for...,"This was an inexpensive bike and it shows. The control knob is hard to turn, and shows little, if any, difference in resistance. The display is flimsy at best. Save your time and money and buy a better model."
5,Good quality for the price,"The shipping was fast via UPS, however the product arrived slightly damaged. It was shipped in the original manufacture's packaging which was obviously not intended to survive regular individual handling. The package had been repaired several times. I was worried that all of the parts would not be present as you could see inside the packaging at several places. When opening the package I found that part of the frame of the bike seat was bent. I was able to bend the part back into shape with a wrench and the assembly of the bike went smoothly from there. The product looks good and performs well. The action is very smooth and the operation is very quiet. Its low profile and quiet operation makes watching TV or listening to music easy. In my opinion, this is a very good product, especially for the low price. It seems very strong and is easily adjustable to fit different people. I would recommend this bike to anyone looking for this type of product."
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased this bike and spent at least 3 hours putting it together with the help of a neighbor teenager. After assembly, he got on the bike and the pedals would not move. After calling customer service at the distributor's in Springfield,Mo., I was told to open the entire case and see if the belts had just tangled up.Customer service was pretty blunt and not very solictous about this problem. In fact, I got the feeling they were just trying to get off of the phone. They appeared to have cared less about me. We did this and found the belt to be jammed solid. We were then told to disassemble the whole thing and send it back in the original box. What a nightmare. I asked for a refund and went and spent good money on a quality piece of equipment that I am very happy with. I would never deal with this company again.....the one in Springfield, Mo.Stamina Magnetic Resistance Recumbent Bikethat distributes these bikes."
3,Poor Quality Control,"This bike seems fairly well made and i'm sure it will work well - once Stamina can figure out how to actually include all of the needed parts to construct it.Be warned as looking at other reviews here it seems like you are about 50% likely to not receive everything you need to actually put it together! I was missing about 15 parts in total, namely a bunch of bolts, nuts and washers that I needed to do the entire seat assembly. They were just completely missing.I have contacted Stamina to get replacement parts shipped out, but from reading other reviews on here that will probably take a week or two so my ""2nd day shipping"" from Amazon was a total waste as I will now have to wait weeks for silly parts that should have been included in the first place."
4,whatever!,"""Reasons"" and ""Apple"" are two classics, played here in an energetically rough-hewn form that turned into smooth polish on thier later albums. I miss the days before Pro Tools, when spirit came before perfection."
3,average power pop album,this album sounds pretty much to any other power pop album it comes with limited horizons nothing to special an average album over all
1,Warning!,"The track listing that Amazon supplies above is not the actual track listing of the ""To Be Free"" CD. I had to find this out the hard way after I purchased the CD. If anyone knows where I would be able to find the CD with ""If You Go Away"" I would be grateful if you responded. Thanks for ruining my night Amazon, because of this I'm going to go beat my children so I can work off my anger. I hope you're satisfied.Update 01-19-05:Well, in case anyone was looking to buy Emiliana Torrini's version of ""If you go away"" on cd, it can be found on ""Next: Tribute to Jacques Brel"". The cd costs $38 without shipping and is an import. The cd contains what appears to be covers of old Jacques Brel songs. I had never heard most of these songs or for that matter of Jacques Brel, but when I listened to them I liked them except for one or two. There's some really good stuff on the cd, so if you want the Emiliana track and don't mind shelling out the money, don't be worried about the rest of the tracks sucking."
5,Electric Generating Systems - an Audel's guide,"This out-of-print volume is a must for anyone intending to maintain a lifestyle in an isolated rural or semi-wilderness environment. Obtaining, repairing, operating and maintaining your own gas powered electric generating system will certainly make life less primitive. This along with a companion Audel publication entitled ""Pumps"" can make a good start on a practical library for anyone planning to abandon city life. These books are written for the do-it-yourselfer. Best of luck to you -- and don't forget to be careful in your endeavors."
5,Contemplative treasure,"Dancing at the Gate is soothing without being trite, contemplative in its ability to evoke images and emotions. ""Wild Geese"" is my personal favorite in this collection -- you can almost hear the geese overhead. Dana Cunningham's musical sensitivity is a real gift."
4,Almost as good ...,"This book is almost as good as a similar book on ""out of the way"" Florida places. I was raised in Fla. and have discovered some places that I had never heard of."
4,Bought This Album Just to Get One Song,"I mainly wanted to get just one song from this album that was not available as a single song download. The Ragin Cajun (Scattin' Cajun)was the track I wanted and now I have it. The other selections are okay,too if you are into Cajun Music."
3,Campaign Setting,"Well, its not a bad book, I was just hoping it was more of a ruleset, with equipment and items, but its more or a campaign setting. And that's a bit of a letdown."
3,Somewhat Dissapointing...,"This book is mainly a review of what occurred in the anime series, And Gives little for a campaign, other than setting, and thrown in stats for the main characters. If you do plan to buy this though, make sure you already own the Big Eyes Small Mouth book(s)"
4,Cute beaded x-stitch patterns,This book has many patterns (wish I had the book here to count!). Almost all are small--ranging from pin size to ornaments--with only one larger sampler piece. (That pillow on the cover is not as big as it seems.) All patterns are suitable for beginners but more advanced stitchers will find these patterns work up quickly enough for presents. There are a number of patterns that could be used to represent months (like an umbrella for March and flowers for May) if you are into that new seasonal craze. Great book if you like the Mill Hill beaded stitchery kits.
5,Excellent roof anchor,"After purchasing Home Depot's Safety Harness system, I was a little uneasy with the hardware they provided to anchor myself to the roof. You have to drive a lot of nails into a single stud. This weakens the stud. It was also very difficult to get all of the nails in the stud, because there were so many of them. The more nails you drive into the stud, the harder it is to get the subsequent nail in.The DBI/Sala Roof Anchor is much better and gives me a lot more confidence. It straddles the anchor instead of having nails/screws driven into it. The hardware is put together very well and I think anyone would feel confident being anchored to it. It comes with a black cap to protect the anchor from the elements when you are not using it and they even provide the tie wrap to hold the cap to the anchor. : -)"
3,For the Die Hard Zipper Head,"While I do enjoy the CD, it is more for dedicated fans of the SNZs than casual listeners or people just getting into them. The CD does adds another dimension to their existing albums, but the sound quality is not as good, nor is it as polished (much of it is live).If you like the band and already have Hot and the Inevitable, than consider this one. Otherwise go with those two first (or perhaps the Best of, but I don't have that one)."
3,Hide The Reefer,"Hey, Zipper heads - as noted below, ""Sold Out"" contains ""Santa Claus Is Smoking Reefer"" as a hidden track. The song was originally recorded as ""Santa's Secret"" by Johnny Guarnieri with Slam Stewart (Savoy, 1944). The Squirrel's version was originally released on ""Kevin & Bean's Christmastime In The LBC"" (1996), one of a series of annual releases by the popular KROQ morning team."
5,The Best Fitness Drink!,This is the best drink ever! I just moved to Texas and I was having trouble adjusting to the climate down here. I was getting dehydrated and feeling terrible. My physical activity was decreasing and other methods of replacing electolytes was not working for me. I began using KO Fitness Recovery Drink and I immediately noticed that I was feeling better. This is a great product.
4,Military Power,This was interesting because I know personally one of the men in the book. If gives all of us an idea of what may be going on militarily without us knowing about it.
4,The Book Description start with a goof.,"The ""Book Description"" submitted by the publisher started: ""American army troops entered Cambodia in April of 1970. President Richard Nixon could not keep ground troops there beyond June 1970 without authorization from Congress, which was not forthcoming.""This is incorrect. President Nixon chose to pull all U.S. troops out at the end of June, but that was his decision. He could have kept troops there months longer, if he had chosen to do so. There were people in Congress trying to impose limitations on the President's ability to use U.S. forces in Cambodia, but they did not manage to get such a limitation enacted into law until January of 1971. I have not yet seen the book, but this error right at the beginning of the publisher's summary of it leaves me a bit suspicious.I don't like the idea of giving a rating (4 stars out of 5) when I have not actually read the book, but the software on this site will not permit me to post any comment without making a rating."
3,Miacles Do happen,"Imformative, gives a good account of an intended mother going through surrogacy with a family member."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This claims to be the ""premiere recording of Cox and Box in original version"". Don't be mislead. This does not mean that it's a complete reading of the score. Most notably, the duet in which Cox and Box are both gambling with loaded dice is omitted. For me, this mars what is otherwise an acceptable performance. There's a fine performance of the ""D'Oyly Carte"" version issued in conjunction with the best ""Ruddigore"" going.The performance of ""Trial by Jury"" is adequate, but no improvement on any of the other recordings available. My favourite ""Trial"" is the D'Oyly Carte recording from the early 1960s now issued on Decca/London as a companion to a fine performance of ""The Yeomen of the Guard""."
1,Missed opportunity,"Several years ago, in London, I picked up a new edition of the orchestra score to COX AND BOX, which contains more music than the truncated curtain raiser that the D'Oyly Carte Company performed for years and recorded. To my knowledge the only complete performance of the score is on a VHS with TRIAL BY JURY from the BBC/PBS series of G&S; operas; why it's unavailable on DVD is a good question. So why not a complete COX AND BOX? There are several good recordings of TRIAL BY JURY already in the catalogue, and I would have been content with a complete COX AND BOX.Now, when do we get a complete recording of the incidental music to THE TEMPEST? It's long overdue."
1,Impossible to read!,"My husband and I recently tried to use this map for our vacation last month. We found it absolutely impossible to use. The numbers for major highways were very difficult to find, and therefore planning our routes was impossible. Towns were not labeled, and the elevation lines got in the way of everything. Save your money and get a tourist map or a rental-car-company map when you arrive at your destination. We're still not sure how Michelin has this fabulous reputation..................."
3,"Good, but you can get better for the price","I bought this TV on sale a few days ago for $110. While it is better than the tv I had, you can get much better for the price. It is definitely not a bad tv.The main disadvantages are that it is mono sound and there is no ""S"" hookup.I am taking it back because Target has a 20"" Memorex flat-screen display for $118 with stereo and S videou outputs."
4,Scherer shines light on the world of disabilities,"In working with people with disabilities I found Scherer's book gave a different slant on their issues and the use of technology. It was easy reading and informative. The case studies gave examples of the various needs, likes and dislikes and preferences of people with disabilites and their uses of assistive technology. Probably the most important emphasis of Scherer's book is know your consumer and listen. There is no universal recommendation for assistive tech for our consumers."
5,"Getting ""Unstuck"" Together","As an occupational therapist working in the school system, and currently providing assistive technology evaluation, education, and training, I found Living in a State of Stuck to be one of the most influential works I have read in a good number of years. We all have stories, and the individuals that Dr. Scherer has listened to and followed in her book have voices that resonate. I have practiced for nearly 30 years, and her approach feels like coming home to the core principles of the profession I have love. Thank you, Dr. Scherer, and please keep writing."
5,Excellent book!,Abigail Hogg does an excellent job explaining horse behavior and what we can do to improve our relationships with horses in this full color book. It is one of the few manual-type books that I've read in which I had a hard time putting it down--I just wanted to keep on reading. She includes case studies which show the application of her recommendations and make it even more interesting.
5,Good,"Ok, I'm still in the first chapters of this dvd but I can say until now the topics are very well explained, with a lot of good information for a hobbyist guitarrist like me."
3,I liked using this product because of the ...,"I liked using this product because of the knowledge that it contains fluoride. This had been recommended to me by the dental hygienist during my last check-up. I felt confident using this product because of the Colgate name that's widely recognized due to their outstanding reputation and long history. I didn't especially like the flavor, """"regular"""". I'd been using a flavored toothpaste prior to this Test Drive and believe that my tastebuds had become accustomed to a sort of fruity flavor."
4,Yeah!! Nice toothpaste!! It has a nice fresh ...,Yeah!! Nice toothpaste!! It has a nice fresh taste. After brushing my teeth my mouth felt sooo fresh. My teeth seemed a little whiter too. The ingredients did not affect my asthma like so many others do. The material that the tube is made out of is great!! It makes it easy to get the toothpaste out. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste to my friends and my family. Thanks Colgate!! This one's a winner!!
5,"Colgate has always made good products, Colgate Total ...","Colgate has always made good products, Colgate Total being one of their best. I have used Colgate Total for over a week and love it. It is not gritty like some other pastes, and it has a mild minty flavor. My whole family used it -- even my six-year-old son and he liked it. He is very picky and hates toothpaste that is too strong. This is one toothpaste I will continue buying now that I have tested it. It's very good!"
3,"documentary, if you are looking for consistent flamenco dancing this isn't it","it is a heartwarming documentary and i enjoyed the fact that anyone canjoin in and improvise to the beautiful music and as the participants said,it just feels like a big party.... i am looking forward to receiving flamenco women ..i saw flamenco women about forty times on the aeroplane trip to england and theywere screening it again on the way home...."
5,It is a real find,If you like opera you must purchase this recording. Music and singing are excellent. It is verismo at its best.There is dramatic tension through the opera and the tragic ending is very moving. A huge praise to Marco Polo for making this opera Known to a wide audience.
3,This product has a very good taste. The ...,"This product has a very good taste. The mint made my mouth feel refreshed, like I had just used mouthwash. The only complaint I have towards the product is that it didn't make my teeth feel very clean after brushing. I have sensitive teeth and I couldn't notice a difference between this toothpaste and ordinary Crest toothpaste. My opinion of this toothpaste is average."
4,"I normally use the regular Crest paste, so ...","I normally use the regular Crest paste, so this product didn't seem that different. The mild mint taste is just that -- a milder version of the regular paste. I only noticed a slight difference in the sensitivity of my teeth, but it was promising enough that I plan to continue using it. I think if used long term, the results would become more apparent. I would recommend this product."
4,Mr. Veggies Family,I love this toy for my work as a Speech Pathologist it allows the kids to use it as a conversational piece or for learning body parts. It's great.
3,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book was more of a Goosebumps than a Fear Street. It was a bit babyish. I thought it would be a good book but I was wrong.
4,This product is on point,Very quiet and shaved very well... i have never felt good with shaving... trashed others i bought previously.. Wahl products is value for money anytime
4,Good hair clippers,"I have been using this Wahl Trimmer for about two years. I haven't had any issues with it, it still does the job well. This product is better than the cheap hair clippers you can get at CVS, WaLmart or Target. I would recommend this hair trimmer since it will last more than a year and pay for itself. Even though this are hair trimmers, I use them as hair clippers to shave my head, I like to use the attachments for it. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,I just put in my order today,I just put in my order today for these trimmers...all my clippes are nothing but wahl...i cant wait till my trimmers come in...i know they ganna be worth it due to the fact wahl been creating great clippers and trimmers since most of us was in pampers.....and with all the great reviews i see on here...i know its worth the money !!!!
2,"Sharp, be careful","Great size trimmer, perfect detailer, but so far it has been pretty bad shaving my neck as it constantly snags and pulls my skin leaving little cuts. I oiled it even further and had the same result. Blade is in alignment so it's not a matter of the under blade sticking out past the upper protection blade. I really wanna love this, but at the moment I cannot recommend it."
5,This is the best part....,"It's a good clipper like everybody else says. Like another reviewer I bought the peanut from Sally's and ended up returning it. I also have a pair of Andis Styliners that work good, but are heavier and can run hot.The Detailer stays fairly cool, is light and is so easy to use that I dropped them on the floor one day and it busted apart...broke the chrome plate off and the housing so it did not hold the blade properly. I called WAHL and they told me to send them in to their repair shop in IL and THEY FIXED THEM FOR FREE. All I paid for is shipping one way. That was 3 years ago and they still cut strong.You can't find that type of customer service anymore."
4,"Great Trimmers, Misleading Listing","I'll start with the bad: the mention blade adjustment tool and plastic storage case were not included in the packaging, nor were they listed in or on the packaging as included accessories. This has already been mentioned in other reviews as well. Disappointing but not a big deal. On to the good: the trimmers are perfect size, surprisingly quiet, very sharp, and seem to be sturdy. Other reviewers mentioned that the blades may be too sharp. I personally did not find them to be so sharp as to cut or irritate my skin. Overall, they are worth the money, I just wish they would change the listing to reflect the actual included accessories so future buyers aren't misled."
4,Does the job,"They are pretty sharp so be careful while using and are lightweight, but a little loud however not unexpected with such a small trimmer so overall I'm pleased with the product. One reviewer said that you could adjust the cut length, but I don't see any way to do so."
1,Health hazard-------had human hair all over it.,Human hair all over this thing. Evidently they sold me what somebody had used. It is a health hazard. Other signs of use include chips and finger prints.
3,8081 Trimmer,I bought it because of the reviews and its a good product. Its not that accurate but it gets the job done.very light weight. But seemed like the trimmer i got was used/refurbished had a couple scratches on it. But i do like the design of it. worth a buy!
5,Fantastic Clippers!!!,"If you don't have these clippers in your clipper collection then you're missing out. With the pro tool set these clippers cut like a professional pair of clippers should. I highly recommend these clippers over the Andis Superliners. I returned the Superliners because they did not have the power that these have. They are light, they don't overheat and are very precise in cutting. If you want that Steve Harvey shape up please add the Wahl Pro 5-Star clippers to your arsenal."
4,These are worth the money...,"i have had a pair of these for a year now and i am happy. I didn't purchase them on amazon but i do shop on here alot and i can assure you that they are less expensive on here! I am not a pro barber (never went to school for it), but i have been cutting my own and my friends hair for about 15 years. These clippers are a God send! i gave them 4 stars only because the andis t-liners offer a little bit more precision. These wahl clippers are ideal for pro and at home barbers and they work really good on hair lines and beards for all hair textures."
2,Wahl Detailer,"i was dissapointed with the clipper, as soon as i plugged it in the first time to use it the fuse blew or there was a spark in it, and to return it would have costed more than the original amount because i ordered it from america and i'm living in ireland so therefore it's just there now, haven't been able to use it or anything, and it's still broken."
3,"Good, but sharp, too sharp","This is a very good product. I must say that it is very sharp, too sharp. I don't have sensitive skin, I don't get razor bumps--so I didn't think anything would really irritate my skin. I've gotten better at handling it, but it will leave your next red all over for a couple of days if you aren't extra careful.I appreciate its precision, but wish it was a little more user-friendly. Maybe I'll get better with it the more I do it. Overall, it's probably worth buying."
1,DependableResource listed this as New but it was USED!,"My hubby is running a streak of bad luck this Christmas. I bought these clippers for him and they were listed as new. He went to use them today and the blades were filled with hair. DISGUSTING! Do NOT buy from DependableResource! I would leave feedback on their seller profile but because I posted speedy delivery and removed my initial feedback, I cannot leave feedback on their page.I wish I could tell you about the quality of the product but we didn't use it. I thought it more important to warn future buyers. I'm sorry the product had to take a hit for it. Avoid DependableResource as the seller if you buy this."
2,Do Not Buy!!,The blades were way to sharp and their dangerous to use against your skin. When trimming up the back of my neck it tore up my skin. I like that they are sharp but their a little bit to sharp. Today i will be returning them.
2,Great while it lasted.,"I bought these trimmers September 2012. They were great until they died 7 months later. I love how close they cut hair and they are quiet. I used them once a week to trim my neck and head so I know they weren't over worked. I kept them oiled and clean. Then one day after being in use for about 2 mins I heard a small ""click"" sound come from them and they worked nevermore. Thank God I had another set of clippers so I could finish the job."
2,Wahl clippers,"The ad for the clippers boasted how great they were... they are not as good as a cheaper set I purchased from Wal-Mart some time ago. They seem dull, very noisy when they are in operation and do not provide the advertised performance. I used them twice, and put them to the side. I am not satisfied at ALL with them! I am a part time barber, and I was looking for something that would perform better than the equipment I currently own, that is when a friend recommended I consider Amazon as a source to shop for them.Thank you,Marco"
4,Ok,"The Clipper seems to work well even though I have only used it once. Being smaller than I expected, is a plus."
4,Wahl Professional 8081 5 star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor,"Solid hairliner. It gets dull in 4 months, but does the job. Extremely light... so it feels good to hold above head while shaving. Personally used to bald head.Prefer to go machine low instead of razor blade low, so as not to get razor bumps. Excellent product."
2,"Buyer beware, used items","I really wish Amazon let you distinguish feedback on the order fulfillment vs the product itself. The trimmer I recieved was apparently used before, because there were a few hair trimmings left in the blades. From other reviews, apparently I'm not the only one; maybe ALL of these are used and some are just cleaned better, or looked at less closely by the recipient.I was not ordering a used item, and the item description certainly doesn't say so. This is no reflection on the product itself. Item was from ""Quick E Shop and Fulfilled by Amazon""."
5,Excellent trimmers,"Excellent trimmers. Great motor that runs smooth and cool. I use it to line up one of my son's hair and shave my other son's whole head. Never had a complaint of getting too hot. Cuts so close it leaves my son's head shiny. Any shorter and he'd need a razor to shave it. Good product. Just shop around to find it the cheapest, cause everyone likes a bargain. You'll be happy with the purchase."
1,Rusted in 3 months,"My husband shaves his head and we purchased this shaver because we had had good luck with Wahl products before. Unfortunately, not this time. The shaver worked well, we kept it in it's original box in our bedroom. Within 3 months, the blade area was full of rust and it was cutting my husband to ribbons. Works well---for a short time. This costs too much to be a disposable razor."
3,Beard trimmer,I thought this beard trimmer worked good and cut close. Be careful using on back of the neck till you get used to it. It will cut you! other than that it was a good trimmer!
5,I could watch this DVD every day for the rest of my life and still be riveted.,"Ananiashvili dances this ballet with such exquisite technique, such perfection of ""line"" and such emotional integrity, that it eclipses all other performances of Odette-Odile I have ever seen--and I have seen many in my long life. Fadeyetchev as the Prince, although not dancing with the emotional intensity of a Malakhov or Nureyev, nevertheless presents his ballerina almost with his own self-effacement. He knows what he's there for, and it's not to show off himself. And, at the least, he is beautiful to look at. The corps is well rehearsed, and again, defers to Ms. Ananiashvili, who doesn't simply dance the Swan Queen, but becomes her so truly that one cannot help but suspend disbelief."
3,Disappointing,"Ms. Ananiashvili was very good, but her partner Fadeyetchev was very, very mediocre. I wonder why he was chosen as a lead performer. I'm sure he loves to dance, but he should not be a premiere in any ballet.Although, i like Ms. Anaisshvili very much, I did not enjoy the production. The worst thing though was the last scene at the lake. The music was not the same music from Tschiakovsky's score that is usually played for that scene of the ballet. It did not fit at all!!!If you have not seen Swan Lake, especially the German ballet version with Steffi Scherzer, then perhaps you will enjoy it. I have seen so many versions of this one-derful ballet, but this was the worst. It's not bad, but it's not good either."
3,"Good sampling, but...","For some reason they CD producers don't think the US market will want the entire collection and only give us one or two of the actual 3-CD Annual that is produced each year.Buy the entire UK import Annual if you want to hear it all. Although this CD is a good sample of the great techno/dance/house, the UK one is the one to get!"
4,This is the real review,These other people need to mature in their veiw of music. They are obviously unknowledgable in the world of electronica. If you want a trance album you dont buy ministry. Dont let their skewed veiws and feeble mind-sets ruin your idea of this cd. Check out the hot tracks featured. Listen for yourself!Aaron -
1,hmmmmmmm,"peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!! The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums! Check it out!"
3,Okay CD,"My great expectations for this CD were ruined when I actually listened to the whole thing. I thought there would be a lot of really good dance songs on there, yet I only recognized a few of them on there. A lot of the songs are too funky for me. I guess I'm just more into the trance scene. This is an average CD, definitely not the best of 2002."
1,A bit too fluffy,"I would consider this a book less about journaling and more about writing exercises in general. I've been journaling consistently for the past 7 years and sporadically for the last 15 years. I was looking for a book to suggest different techniques for composing a journal (perhaps some real-life examples), unique ways of formatting, and perhaps varying perspectives for reflecting on the days experiences and larger life events. This book is more reminiscent of an entry level composition course, describing how to draw a cluster diagram, and suggesting writing topics. Some of the exercises just seemed dull and not related to really keeping a chronology of one's experiences. If you're just getting started journaling or looking for general writing exercises then this may be your book. On the other hand, if you're looking ways of extending what you already do or looking for examples of what others have done, don't bother with this."
5,An energizing way to get back to the journal,This book gave me a reason to sit down and get started journalizing again. I feel it would be equally valuable to someone who has never put a pen to paper on a daily basis. The style is easy to read and carries you right along without any thought that you might not be able to do any of the exercises.
2,Not What I Expected,"I would probably say that this book would be an okay read for those new to journaling. I have been writing/journaling, for 10 years now and I was looking for a book that would expand on some of my ideas as well as give me new ones. However I found the exercises to be surfacy and almost childish, not as deep as I was expecting. There are some good points in this book so it's not all bad, though I feel there is something missing. Also this book really seems like it was meant for the female audience, as all the examples are from women. I kind of felt left out as a man. If new to writing a journal this could be helpful, but to those experienced in the practice, I would steer away."
3,Does Beauty equal Pain,"With this shoe you are sure to be the envy or all your girlfriends, but you toes literally will feel like they are about to fall of. What disturbs me is that the shoe begins to hurt within minutes of putting on. Definitely a hot shoe, but only where to the movies or dinner...get my drift..."
3,If You Knew Eddie.....,"After having read several negative reviews for ""The Eddie Cantor Story"" I was hesitant to purchase this video but I felt, ""what the heck"" and did. I am glad I did as I enjoyed this biography, due in no small part to Keefe Brasselle's energetic portrayal of ""The Apostle of Pep"". One of the inherent problems I have found with Hollywood biographies is the desire on the part of the studios to sacrifice facts for what they believe to be great storyline. While this may have been true in this case I nonetheless enjoyed watching Mr. Brasselle entertain me with his spirited recreation of Mr. Cantor's routines. For those of us too young to have had the pleasure of seeing Eddie Cantor perform on stage this will be the best chance of doing so."
2,"Dated, storyline. But hear the REAL Cantor voice singing.","Hey, Cantor fans forget the movie - the biography runs untrue, and flat. But buy the tape anyway! Because, that's Cantor singing his own song greats on the movie soundtrack. Time to get your tape player or mini disc player ready to record the musical numbers from this Warner Brother's flick. Hear many of Cantor's great song interpretations without the ""clicks"" and ""pops"" of the primitive, limited recording technology of Cantor's time. Cantor and his songs have never SOUNDED better."
1,little truth to the story and vocals are by an aging Cantor,"If you want to see what the real Eddie Cantor was like in his prime, watch Palmy Days or Roman Scandals, both made in the early 1930s. Even though the vocals in this biopic were recorded by Eddie, he was older and in poor health and did not sing as well as when he was younger. Sadly, the movie does not tell about Cantor's humanitarian nature: his verbal attack on the character of anti-semitic Father Coughlin in 1939 that put an end to Cantor's half-million dollar radio contract; his having Sammy Davis Jr. as a return guest on the Colgate Comedy hour in the early 1950s after Sammy's first visit caused an outpouring of hate mail; his coining the phrase ""March of Dimes"" when FDR asked Cantor for advice in raising money to fight polio."
3,"""If You Knew Eddie....""","One of the inherent problems I have found with Hollywood biographies is a desire on the part of the studios to tell less of the truth and more of what they feel is great storyline. To be honest, unless an audience was there at the time of the actual events, how would they know the difference? While I am not necessarily in favor of playing fast and loose with the facts, I would like to recommend ""The Eddie Cantor Story"". Keefe Brasselle's energetic portrayl of Ol' Banjo Eyes was certainly more than enough to keep me interested and sparked in me a desire to start collecting recordings of this marvelous performer. I do not doubt that the facts may have been triffled with, but who cares? Just get this movie and enjoy a slice of real musical talent. The songs are top notch and the sound quality well recorded."
5,Preferred it to both Jolson flicks,"I personally dislike Brassell, but I loved him performing the songs. I have always preferred Jolson to Cantor as a singer, entertainer and as he comes across just as a person. Nonetheless I disliked ""The Jolson Story"", maybe because I wasn't interested in his youth. I would own and love ""Jolson Sings Again"" however, except I read that Jolson himself did not dub the songs for that flick. I thought the Cantor flick was exciting and fun - except when Brassell was required to act instead of ""sing""."
1,The worst bio pic ever!,"This movie is terrible! Obviously, the producers tried to revitalize Eddie Cantor's career the same way Al Jolson did with the ""Jolson Story"". If you want a better telling of the same story, see the aforementioned biography of Al Jolson!!"
1,Step right OFF!!,"I'm a completist by nature and WAITS-stuff is my WEAKNESS (that AND any post-Ginger SPICE GIRL junk). That being said, I bought this expecting something interesting. And that I got, IN SPADES!!!! Give me 3RD BASE's sample of ""Way Down in the Hole"" while Prime Minister Pete Nice SCATS (on ""The Cactus Album"") over THIS trash!!! The only halfway-enjoyable track is the VIOLENT FEMMES' ""Step Right Up,"" but even THAT should've quit while it was ahead!! No need to fill out the full 5+ minutes, ya' 'Sconies!!I love WAITS, but this one is not one I could recommend. Pick up a HOLLY COLE album if you want interesting TOM WAITS cover versions. Plus, she ain't too hard on the eyes, if you know what I'm layin' down."
5,Great product!,"I had ordered this expecting to get a cheap plasic microphone with a worthless stand, but as soon as i opend the box i noticed the metal body on the mic. The microphone works great but it would hae been better if it had a 1/4 plug on the cord insted of a XLR plug. The mic is a little quiet so i sugest getting a mini mixer or sound mixer if you don't already have one. If you buy theNady 4-CHANNEL Mini Mixeryou will have to buy a XLR Female to 1/4 Male adapter. The stand is working fine so far, no problems with it. The mic cord doe's seem a little cheap but it works for now."
3,5 Stars for the mic - 1 star for the wires,"I ordered two of these Nady SP1 and for the price, it's an amazing values.Musician's Friend is an AMAZING place to order from as well.Both of the XLR <--> XLR wires died within 2 hours! Bottom line is that the package is a great value but the wires are really, really low quality."
2,MIC AND STAND PACKAGE COMES WITH NO MIC STAND!!!!,"I was worried I didn't receive any shipping confirmation over a week after purchasing the ""package"". I was going to wait until the final day of the ""estimated arivial"" of the package. When the package finally came, it only included the mic and cable but no mic stand. I figured the stand was coming in a separate package, the packing slip printed and the ""comments"" said ""no mic stand"". I checked back on the online description and customer reviews and didn't see any note of ""mic and stand package but no mic stand"".I took the lost, I'll never buy from these individual sellers again."
4,Great value except .....,"I would have given this microphone / atand package a ""5 stars"" rating if the microphone cable came with 1/4"" insert plug. Unfortunately it came with XLR male plug. I had to buy another cable from Music Friend and paid additonal $17.99. It is still worthwhile as the package is only $19.99 which is really a great value. It won't work for Amp which accept only 1/4"" insert plug. Whoever interested in the package should be aware of this. Other than that, microphone works fine, although the volume is a little weak. The quality of stand is excellent."
5,Absolute bargain!,"I don't know how Nady can supply a mic, cable and stand for $25.The mic isn't anything to write home about - it's no Shure SM58, but it is better than could be expected and probably worth the $20 on its own.And then you have an XLR Mic lead - try and find one for under $10 anywhere. And it's actually reasonable quality too.AND you get a mic stand - you'll spend $15 on an equivalent stand. It is a prefectly adequate mic stand. Indestinguishable from the other mic stands I've purchased at $20+.You can't go wrong with this package. The mic's not pro, but for a stand, cable and mic, it's amazing!"
5,Nady SP1 Microphone and Stand Package,"The Mic is cheap, the stand is nice but what a combo deal! I likes I likes"
5,GREAT MIC! BAD CORD! WORTH IT!,"the cord that comes with it is crap, so be prepaired to replace it if u use it alot. it went out on me about 2 weeks after owning it. but maybe i just ha a defected one. either way, u can't beat the price. it is totally worth it just for the mic and the stand. the mic is great for PA use, and other uses. great sound pick up."
2,Buy with an Adapter,"The microphone didn't work with my keyboard (it ended up needing a Dynamic Microphone). And if you get this, make sure you get an adapter so you can easily plug it to an amplifier too.(I got a better deal at Radio Shack on a better mic, I could've gotten a better stand for the same price too, oh well...) When I finally did try the microphone on an amplifier, the sound was so soft, you can hardly hear it. I'll keep this for the microphone stand, although next time I'd choose a stand that doesn't have these three legs you can trip on.When I got this microphone, the seller packed it badly. The box was falling apart, tape open, box was beat up, paper work falling out. I'd think twice before buying from a seller who's not Amazon direct."
2,Had to improvise the stand,This is a good deal but the screws for the boom and the legs were both stripped and i had to fix them. I was disappointed as i had to use the item the night i got it and had some problems with it.
5,The Best,"If you enjoy pure talent, serenely beautiful music, exceptional creativity and excellent productions- then look no further. I enjoy Rock, Country, Bluegrass, New Age, Classical, Jazz and Irish to name a few. I have enjoyed very few albums in my lifetime as much as this one. Just incredible..."
1,Doesn't stand up to the pressure!,"I have two afghan hounds, 65 pounds each. I bought 2 of these cots brand new in the box. Assembly was easy enough, they looked great, although very lightweight. That may have proved their undoing. The cots lasted 3 days! The product will hold the weight, but when the dogs tried to move their blankets around on the cots, the mesh tore under the pressure of their claws. One small tear quickly turned into a huge 2 foot hole in a matter of minutes. Unrepairable. Good concept, but materials just don't measure up. Certainly not worth the $45 we shelled out for each of them. Not a good investment for your money."
3,flimsy,Nice idea and lightweight but my deerhound tore one up within days and i can't find a replacment mesh anywhere. What a sad waste of money.
3,Songs of Yrjo Kilpinen - Error in Content Listing,"A Finnish friend of mine, who is a big Kilpinen fan, asked me to point out here that number 3 on the list of songs from this album should be ""An Das Lied"" (or in Finnish: ""Laululle""), and not ""Alte Kirche."""
3,A great singer promoting bad music,"I agree with almost all assessments of Mr. Austin. I am a big fan of the great German baritone Gerhard Huesch, too. However, I have so say that Mr. Austin was extremely kind to Kilpinen's songs Huesch performs here by calling them 'not memorable for their vocal attributes'. It is simply bad music - professional, but second-hand and terribly boring. Yrio Kilpinen was Huesch's friend and Huesch recorded many of his songs. I wish Huesch recorded more Lieder by another friend of his, Hans Pfitzner, or more ballads by Carl Loewe instead: nobody felt and sang Pfitzner or Loewe better than him. I am not against modern Lieder at all - there are some lovely songs on Huesch's CD, Vol. 4 on Preiser, as Mr.Austin mentioned in passim. But this selection is difficult to tolerate even if you enjoy Huesch's voice in its prime. Why did not he record Sibelius's songs?"
1,"Pretty watch, but disappointing shipment","I ordered this as a gift for my wife. It arrived OK, and it was everything that I had expected, except that it did not work. I suspected that the battery was old, that the watch had been lying around for years so that the battery had worn down, and I did not want to incur the expense of having a new battery installed. Happily, Amazon refunded the purchase price. I wound up getting a similar one through eBay. Except that UPS somehow lost it in their system (I suspected internal theft). So, I finally had to order a much more expensive one from the eBay merchant. Pulsar Women's Watch #PRS584X"
2,"""Charlie""","This was always my favorite Masterpiece Theatre series. I just saw Christopher Casenove as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady this afternoon at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, California. He was terrific. I can't wait to order the 10-disk DVD's from Amazon when it is available in August. This was the best series ever from Masterpiece."
5,She is a real Duchess,I loved the first season and I loved this second one. Following Louisa's life taught me that is possible to reach our dreams.
2,"Same old, same old.","I ordered the 3 books in this series and was very disappointed. Just another not very interesting story about a not very interesting woman amateur sleuth with the same old detective boyfriend. Definitely not a ""page turner"" and really disappointing. I had hoped for something like Lee Harris writes. Forget that."
1,Horrible,"Had the lighter for 2 days. It will not longer spark and doesn't work at all. BIg time FAIL. Come on, 2 days and it's dead!"
5,Best brand in the world!!,"Great lighter with a lifetime guarantee. Cuts my cigars with a perfect hole, and lights in winds of most speeds. The fuel window prevents me from running out of gas on the golf course."
5,lost mine,"I had this one before, it works great when using it for a cigar. I know it works great because someone took it from me on my wedding day and didn't return it. The bottom of the lighter has a puncher, it works ok but i prefer to cut my cigars. Over all I'd recommend to a friend, which I have and they bought one."
4,Verynice lighter,The double jet flame really fires up a cigar very quickly. The lighter has a window to check the fluid level and so far it is working all right. I believe thatone star is missing in this case due to the design and appearance (very personal POV).
4,A solid lighter,"I have a friend who constantly tries to steal this lighter from me...and he's not alone. One time I left it at his place by mistake, needless to say had I not remembered he was not going to tell me. That's the kind of lighter this one is. It definitely catches the eye and in ones hand it feels solid and has a good feel. I own a XIKAR cutter which gave me confidence about this product. One thing I did notice, it rarely lights immediately if you press down quickly, you have to press down and allow gas to flow out for a second or so then ignite. It doesn't bother me though, this is a sturdy tool that deserves accolades. Highly recommended."
1,Save your money,"I've had this lighter for about 18 months. Xikar has replaced it twice in that time. I received the lastest replacement in late August and it worked great until mid September when the igniter started sparking to the lighter frame instead of over the gas jet. I'm now waiting for the third replacement. Great warranty, you'll need it."
4,Misfits Ha!,"There are several Honeydogs gems on this compilation that you need to have. First, ""Rosie Flores"" is an unabashed country pop song reminiscent of Glen Campbell's ""Gentle On My Mind"". Next, home recorded ""Panacea"" is among the best ballads written by Adam Levy. ""Corazones y Cabezas"" is a stylized freaked out version of ""Hearts and Heads"" (from Here's Luck) that might be better than the original. You can't go Wrong here, there are no duds on this CD."
3,Good watch,"I got it as a gift, and it was a good buy for the price. It is a little thicker than I would have liked, and the construction looks a little cheaper than the price suggests. Not bad though."
2,Bad Start,"I ran this timer for 1 day and it began to fail to open for watering. I changed the batteries, no luck. I called Orbit and they said my water preasure had to be limited to 82lbs, which was not noted in their manual.I turned down my water preasure to about 75lbs and it still didn't work. I had to turn down the preasure to a level that could not drive my impact sprinkler before this timer would open its water valve.I offered to send it back to Orbit, instead of Home Depot where I purchased it, so they could evaluate their problem. I received no response to my email. They claim a 4 year warranty but do not state it in their manual?? I returned mine and got a Gilmore 9100 at Lowe's.My advice, go to the Gilmour 9100 or 9400 water timer. A more time tested and reliable product."
1,Not Durable,I've had four of these over two years and I've had them stop working after 1-2 months. Which is serious news in Arizona. Even when they do work they rapidly start to emit a high pitch squeal that you don't want to hear at 5:00am. The start of the high pitched squeal means the unit is failing..
2,"Hose end broke off, big water bill.",I used this to start my lawn from seed 2 years ago and then stored it in my garage. I didn't have any problems with it the 1st time. The interval and duration times seem to work okay and the options fit my watering style well. Yesterday I prepped and reseeded my lawn and retrieved my orbit water timer with plans on watering 12 times a day with 5 mintue intervals. I tested it by turing it on and off heard the shut off click. I tightened it on the spigot and tested it with the sprinkler and it worked well. So I set it up in the evening after a hard days work. When I woke up this morning my water pressure was low. I check out the spigot where the orbit was connected and it broke off from the spigot and water was gushing out. The metal hose end was still tite on the spigot. But the plastic base connecting the hose end to the timer broke off. Now I'm looking for a better made timer. That night's water bill is probably going to be 2 to 3 times the price of the timer.
1,Don't buy it,"This was the ""best"" timer I could buy at the local hardware. The first one leaked; the replacement never worked at all."
2,Orbit Faucet Control,I have tried to program the control to come on once per day. It does not work or it comes on at a different time.
1,Does not work,"I purchased this timer to water my tomatoe plants. The first one was broken right from the package (the frequency dial was not connected inside). I traded it in for a new replacement. This one does not work reliably either. Sometimes it will come on if I set the frequency no longer than once a day, but anything beyond that and it never comes on. My tomatoe plants have almost died several times before I realized what was happening and watered them by hand. I think I've had it too long to take back for a refund, but if I can I will do so. DON'T BUY THIS UNRELIABLE PIECE OF JUNK."
1,absolutely unreliable,"I bought the Orbit 6215 Model HT2 to water my flowers. I had nothing but trouble. First it would not start at all. Then it would start but never stop. Changing battery, adjusting pressure to bellow 50 PSI.... nothing helped. This is just a bad design and a waste of time and money.Mike"
1,3 different units leaked then completely failed within a year.,"I must be a slow learner. It was what the local hardware store carried, so I made repeated purchases. These come in different configurations, some controllers run multiple valves.These Orbit brand units really suck.Now I have the opportunity to share my experience with this product. I will move onto the next manufacturer and see how I fare."
1,Stopped working after two days,I wish I'd seen the rest of these reviews before purchasing this unit off the shelf at Home Depot. I ran into the same problem as many others who have posted here: it simply stopped working after just a few cycles. Replacing batteries made no difference. Save yourself the hassle of returning it and just get a different timer.
4,Great irrigation timer!,"This is the 4th timer that I'm buying for my father. He's been using the others at random locations throughout his yard, greenhouse and garden. They have been very dependable, also the batteries have worked throughout the season without fail. We would recommend this timer, it's simple, durable and easy to run."
4,Delivers what it promises,"Strange as it may seem, the title and claim of this book are fully justified. Although you won't be speaking Spanish immediately, you just might be able to get the gist of a newspaper article or simple book. The great value to me was that it inspires confidence in ones ability to build a significant vocabulary with little effort. It's like getting a great big jump-start to learning another language."
5,Excellent and very easy to understand,"I spoke no Spanish before I bought this book. Now I can interact with the Spanish speaking people on my job. I have the book at work and after one week of having this book on my job, I can more effectively do my job with the Spanish speaking employees. Thanks for a very easy to comprehend book."
4,I found this book to be very useful at work.,"I do not speak Spanish, but after having this book in my office at work for one week, I'm happy to say I am now talking to the people I need to interact with who do not speak English to get the job done without an interpreter, for the most part. Thank you Mr. Mazal-Cami for writing this book. You've increased my ability to perform my job more successfully."
3,Could have been better.,"This could have been a five star book. It is organized very well and does an excellent job presenting how the endings of english words convert to spanish. e.g., (ive) to (ivo). However, it does not list all of the most common words in each category. Instead it gives some commonly used words plus words that look like an unusual ending was put on a common word. Also, it lists only a couple of exceptions to the rules where I would have preferred a comprehensive list of exceptions to each rule. A huge oversight in the pronunciation section was saying that all consanants are pronounced the same in engligh and spanish. What about the letter (v)? The author provides a good list of cognates at the end of the book that don't follow specific rules. Overall, I would say the book is worth for learning the rules that convert english to spanish words."
4,Frank Sinatra book,This is a good and quick reference book on the man.I suggest it for any Sinatra fan who likes to collect his memorabiliaIts a great quick reference
5,Fluidmaster Replacement Cartridge,"The toilet bowl never has any discoloration rings or stains with this product. The Fluidmaster cartridge (one) lasts for about 3 months (2 people using the toilet) as described by the manufacturer. I am basicly not cleaning the toilet bowl anymore. The cartridge installs so that the bleach does not come in contact with your tank water so there is no damage to plumbing. The bowl always has a fresh, clean smell. Great product!"
4,Easy to install. Good product.,"You can smell the bleach (or maybe chlorine?) a little bit when you install it, which I appreciate. I live in an area with very hard water and it unfortunately doesn't seem to help prevent water lines from forming in the bowl."
4,8302P8 FlushSpar Cartridge,"My experience with this product has been very positive with one caveat. The good qualities are reflected in its design and materials. The caveat is somewhat minor in nature and does not keep me from recommending it. The only negative thing is in not readily knowing when its contents are depletedunless the cartridge is taken out of the unit. If it has been depleted, it will be obvious by its disappearnce and a new cartridge is needed. If any portion of the old cartridge remains, it has to be reinstalled in the unit. I think that the cartridge material should be redesigned to have a very thin high visibility colored center core. This would cause the color of the flush water to become visibly different as the cartridge nears its replacement time."
1,Quality Control Broken,Multiple replacement cartridges exspired in less then 10 days. Contacted manufacture and was sent new cartridges but same problem with two of them. The third cartridge worked fine for four weeks. It appears to be a luck of the draw product. At cost vs. performance they are not worth installing.
5,Works Good!,Keeps your porcelain throne smelling nice and breach fresh. It delays the need to swab the bowl as often. I mean what more can you say about an item like this in possible mixed company (LOL).
5,Keeps my toilet bowl clean,Chlorine inserts from Fluidmaster direct the solution where it does the most good - directly into the toilet bowl. Chemicals don't mix or sit in the tank so as to not damage any parts within.Very pleased with product.
5,Great Product,"For years we used chlorine tablets in the tank and all they did was damage the internal hardware in the toilet. When refurbishing all three toilets in our home, I saw these units and decided to give thema try. Fantastic product and for three months they have kept the toilets spotless. I don't like the ""Blue"" as they don't keep the bowls clean and the ""Enzymatic"" cartridges are for septic tanks. The bleach tablets are my favorite."
1,This game has StarForce in it,"StarForce is a malware copy protection that installs itself silently with the game. After it is installed you will most likely find that your DVD-RW drive doesn't work - it disables pretty much any means by which it might be possible to distribute copies of the game. StarForce remains on your system even after you uninstall the game. Go to http://www.glop.org/starforce/ to learn more.In other words, just don't."
4,Good Buy,"After geting passed the whole Starforce problem (Which took me longer then I thought) I finally got the game to work, its a great game kind of like a chessy horror movie. It has puzzles and you wont get board. I was happy to set the game up so it played though the ps2 controller. I would recommend though if you have problems with starforce then just either put a crack over it which is legal if you got the game. (AND I HOPE YOU DO BEFORE APPLING IT ON!) or get the PS2 or XBOX version and enjoy. PS Its fun if you got a friend that wants too play with you so you can work together"
1,Starforce,"Its a shame this games uses star force I would have liked to play it, I have heard some horror stories about the program starforce and I am not buying a game that uses it. I did research on this program do not use it."
1,Obscure Stinks!!,This has to be the worst game I ever purchased. (I have over 100 games).You cannot use your mouse. You have to use the keyboard.Do not waste your money!!
5,If you are looking of a truly exceptional book!,"It is a story of hope for the hopless, courage for the those who feel they have none, and Love when all that is lovely has been taken away.Connie Vines writes in the first person as Tanayia. From the first I found myself reliving a time that most would gladly change if given a chance. Don't mis out on this beautiful book, Whisper upon the Water.Diane Weaver, Bridges Romance Magazine"
5,Appreciate Beer Anew,"This is a great book to alter your perspective on alcohol in our society. It also has invaluable herbal information from practiced and historical herbalists. The literary selections in the text are also quite beautiful. Not so hot as a recipe book, but good for ideas and experimentation."
2,"Some interesting, some stupid","The author's axe has been ground down to a thin edge. The main faces of the blade are1) Western medicine is bad and doesn't work2) Plant medicine does largely because of some mystical ""sacredness""3) The same can be said for the Abrahamic religions and the ostensibly more authentic and ""spiritual"" traditions from anywhere else.That's not my main beef with this book. It's downright dangerous. Many of the formulae are unknown quantities, and I'd be interested in trying them. Some of them are hazardous to your health like hensbane, mandrake root and jimsonweed. DO NOT TRY THESE RECIPES. YOU CAN END UP SERIOUSLY INJURED OR DEAD. There are others which won't kill you because you couldn't possibly choke down enough to hurt yourself. Any beer brewed from oak leaves and oak twigs will be indescribably bitter. One has to wonder where the guy came up with this."
3,beer babble,"I was looking forward to getting some really good recipes from this books, which it does contain; however, it's full of legends and bologne that just waste space. He would've done better to leave out all that junk and just stick with the recipes! The book is way longer than it needed to be."
2,Oh good greif...,What promises to be an interesting book is loaded with new-age claptrap and vague sourcing. The recipes would be good; if you are a risk-taker.
3,"CD is ok, but the item description could be better...",The title is The Mobile Cop JIBAN... as some of you may remember this serie from the 80's---it's sorta like the power rangers that came out in the early 90's except that this one was a little better. I wish that the producers would make the boxset serie already...It was a good t.v. show. Anyway...if you plan to buy this cd dont expect too much. The only actual songs it has are the intro of the show and the outro...but the rest of the tracks are simply the sound effects of the series... I bought it because I thought it might have actual songs from japanese artists but it does not! The titles of the tracks are also writen in Japanese characters. So if you want to spend your money go ahead otherwise you can simply listen to the intro/outro on youtube for free. Hope this helps.
5,Nice book,"I recommend this book for everyone that thirst in science, because this book will answer the possibilities using hydrogen as an energy, and explain everything in fun way. Congrats for Rex..."
2,A bit.....ehhh...yawn....,I purchased this movie used through amazon.com. Considering that this movie is from 1970 impresses me a tad. It has a quality to it that seems more like a late 80's or early 90's vibe to it.It's reasonably entertaining but I have to say that I turned it off midway through a couple weeks ago and have yet to go back and finish it. I was too tired one night to finish it. I have watched about a half a dozen other movies since then.Let's just say that I rarely turn of a movie halfway through. The synopsis created by amazon.com will give you the lowdown as to what this movie is about. I will not go through anymore details. All I can say is with shipping and handling that I only spent about $4.50. At least it didn't hurt my wallet too much.
4,Ben Harper Shows His Versatility,"An excellent album. I must say that I prefer his earlier efforts, but this one is very good. Ben showcases his ability to experiment with new styles and influences. ""Please Bleed"" ""The Woman In You"" ""Burn to Shine"" they are all great."
5,"Even Better Than ""Fight For Your Mind""","I loved this album the first time I heard it.... not too many artists can match the versatility on this album. Definitely better than ""Fight For Your Mind"" (I'd rate that at 4.5/5.0), which doesn't have the likes of the rocking, riff-filled ""Less"". ""Alone"", ""Woman in You"", ""Two Hands of a Prayer"" (really expressive vocals on this number), ""Show Me a Little Shame"", ""Please Bleed"" are the outstanding numbers (not in that order), but all the rest are also great.Such a refreshing change from the mainstream crap. Ben Harper defines the meaning of the ""Alternative"" genre."
4,Very worthwhile purchase--Harper is an excellent artist,"I first heard this album about two months ago and finally bought it on a whim last week. I was very impressed, especially with Harper's voice. Though it's not the most pleasant-sounding voice I've ever listened to, the range of emotion he is able to display with it, from the outpouring of his soul on ""Beloved One"" to the upbeat, love-note sentimentality of ""Steal My Kisses,"" is like nothing I've heard before. The second half of the album is a bit better than the second, though. ""Less"" is a bit grungy for my taste. However, I plan to eventually buy all of Harper's album's--he's an excellent artist."
4,Simple tunes which you wish YOU had written!,"If musical heaven exists it must be like this. The instrumentation on ""Alone"" is unbelievably rhythmic, when the song ends it continues playing in your mind. ""The woman in you,"" & ""Two hands in Prayer"" have the signature Juan Nelson bass booming, making the relatively simple licks it accompanies sound so out of this world. On this album I have been most impressed by the dynamics in Ben's voice and supporting vocals have also added to the experience(reminiscent of the work he did with ""the mutonic four"" on Welcome to the Cruel World."
4,Burn to Shine,"This new cd by Ben Harper is just as good if not better then The Will to Live. Ben Harper and the innocent criminals are a rockin' band. Their music has a little hendrix, a little Marley, a little of everything. This new album has more of a rockish feeling to it then the last. Go out and buy the album, its great. Just want to say hey to my big bro Dean Butterworth. Keep Rockin'!!!!!!"
4,"Good, but not as great.","This is the latest Ben Harper album and although it is good it doesn't feel as great as the other three. There are a number of stand out tracks here like 'Please Bleed' that have Harper's usual sit-up-and-take-notice lyrics. However the overall effect of the album seems a little dissapointing when compared to his earlier efforts. It also seems shorter but that is more of a trivial complaint. Harper likes to experiment and his music has clearly evolved over that space of four albums. With this album, Harper has gone for a western theme. This is reflected in some of the songs where it sounds like the soundtrack to a western film. Even if this one isn't as good it is still an album worth owning and most Harper fans won't be dissapointed. If you are new to Ben Harper, my advice is to buy one of the other albums first and work your way along."
2,Doesn`t Shine All That Much,"A decent, yet unconvincing, rock/soul/folk/blues album, ""Burn to Shine"" manages to deliver some good songs here and there (the crestfallen ""Alone"", the energic ""Less"" or the intense ""Please Bleed""), but fails to rise above middle-of-the road territory. Basically an hit-and-miss effort, the record really runs out of steam on its last part, presenting some boring, tedious and unappealing ballads.Ben Harper is an alright singer and performer, still this release isn`t one of his best moments (neither is it the worst, since his debut album was one of the more dull things I`ve heard).Competent yet not very challenging."
2,Skip it,"This is Ben Harper's worst album. I'm a big fan and enjoy listening to all of his other albums, but I rarely take this one off the shelf. That being said, the tremendously catchy ""Steal My Kisses"" and ""Suzy Blue"" are good songs, but that's really it for this album. If you're just getting into Harper, start out with Fight for Your Mind (my favorite) or Welcome to the Cruel World."
4,Rockin,"I had heard ""Steal Your Kisses"" on the radio and fiogured I'd see what the whole album sounded like. I am not disappointed. What a great artist. You can really feel the emotion in his music."
5,a gem,I took a trip to Idaho to visit my brother who is a student at the Idaho State University in Pocatello. As I played Dave Matthews over and over again on my cd player my brother asked if I had heard Ben Harper. I listened to his copy of Burn to Shine and haven't taken it out of my player since. I'm always on the lookout for powerful original music and with Burn to Shine I have found just what I'm looking for.
5,Oh my god how good is this!,"I had never heard of Ben Harper before he was mentioned in a chat room i was in, likeing what was being said I went off to see what i could find at my local record shop and came home with this. I was blown away with what i heard, the intensity of the music really can move you. I would, without any doubt, recommend this to any one who appreciates real music not that crap that seems to be so popular with the kids today. No one I know had ever heard of Ben Harper before i brought this c.d but I'm trying to put that to rights now and tell the world what a musical genius Ben is!"
5,These are the BEST !,"Our family has both the Brainy Baby series and the baby einstein videos. Brainy Baby simply beats Baby Einstein hands down! ... Everyone that we talk to gives Brainy Baby a 5 star rating. ... The Brainy Baby series is most certainly worth the investment. As a mom, here is what I would tell you: ...If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! (Not to mention that Brainy Baby is 50% longer than Einstein for the same price). Brainy Baby has not only taught our 17 month old daughter the ENTIRE alphabet, but it has been a lifesaver for my sanity too! I can't imagine any home without Brainy Baby. One more thing... for those of you who don't believe in these types of videos for early education, does your baby know the alphabet at age 17 months? These products can only help. Why wait until your child is too old to benefit."
2,Could be a lot better. Nice images but boring.,"My kids (ages 3 and 1 )have been growing up with the Baby Einstein series. I decided to try something else. The ""Left Brain"" format is very similar using colorful toys, children and classical music. They just don't have the nack at entertaining the way Baby Einstein does. My 1 year old enjoys it more than the 3 year old, who just wanders off, but even he gets bored before its over."
2,not a development tool but a fancy mobile,"The production quality is good and I do appreciate that the music is played by an orchestra and not a lone synthesizer but overall I can not reccomend these videos as development tools for infants.There are many concepts introduced but few are repeated and most are introduced quickly and dissapear quickly. There is also little continuity between concepts. It doesn't seem to me that these videos are based on any research on how infants learn from television but, even so, the videos sure do make rather bold educational claims. I am sorry to say that these videos are not ""a breakthrough in infant development"" as they say, but yet another spin-off of the toys-moving-to-music format.Some of the moving toys attracted my infants attention but I don't agree that these videos are learning tools. Maybe for a toddler but not an infant. For many infants these videos will be nothing but a fancy mobile - and there's nothing wrong with that."
4,Good entertainment,"My daughter likes this dvd but prefers the Brainy Baby-Right Brain better. Not sure why, maybe it's because it was the first one I bought her or she just likes the content better. Either way they are both good, but I'd give Right Brain 5stars."
5,Brainy Baby LEFT BRAIN,Two thumbs way up for this addition to the RIGHT BRAIN video! Our daughter is either busy trying to find the flash card that goes with what is being shown on the screen or she is twirling to the music. Either way she is learning and that is the whole reason we bought these in the first place. I have found quality for my money and an educational experience with Brainy Baby that doesn't talk down to our kids but inspires them to join in on the learning!
1,Just another opinion,"I am a parent of a 7 month baby. I have bought the left brain and right brain.I had observed my baby for the first few days. Apparently, she is more interested in Barney and Sesame street. My wife and I are very happy that we can have time to ourselves.The funniest thing that never fail to make me laugh is that when we switch to this video, she will watch for less than 2 minutes and start to crawl and struggle for remote control to turn it off. Unbelieveable !!!Having said that, it really depends as different baby respond to different videos. Perhaps mine like songs, dances, and brightly coloured creatures moving around. She will clap and move excitedly together with Barney. So I will stick to Barney for the moment until she is older."
2,Not for babies,"Sorry, but I have to give this DVD a negative review.First of all: what age is it really for? There are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition. Don't you think it's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old (and probably even 3)? The DVD needs much more real life objects, it sounds and looks VERY dull and boring. I always thought that children learn through play, songs, rhymes, and etc, but not through dull repetition. Even alphabet is introduced without well known ""ABC song"". I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend:Hap Palmer ""Baby songs: ABC,123, colors & shapes"";Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder;Baby Babble - speech enhancing video;Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors);The Wiggles-""Toot-Toot"""
5,The best set of Videos for kids,"My child loved these videos. The colors, the music, and the other babies. My son, at 15months old, not only knew his alphabet but he could recognize and say each letter. My children don't watch a lot of tv but when they do it should be educational. And this will be a video they will learn from.By the way, my son also knows his colors and shapes from the other videos in this collection!"
3,Not as good as English or Laugh & Learn,This is good but I perfer English & Laugh & learn. More speaking in those. But better then baby einstein any day!!!!
1,not so hot,"My son wasn't so interested in this. It keeps his attention for about 2 minutes, and the images I could supply at home with REAL toys instead of a whole 30 or 40 min. of watching plastic toys on tv."
5,Brainy Baby Dvd & CD,My 7 month old cousin loves watching the DVD and also likes the bonus CD- both play without any problems-Thank You!
4,Better Gums,Mail order is about the only way to get the Butler GUM stimulators. I have my original teeth because of regular dental care and good cleaning. The rubber tipped stimulators keep my gum tissue pliable and healthy.
5,Glad to find,I was glad to find this product. The drug stores in my area no longer carry the refills. I didn't need any more handles!
5,Thank you,Nearly impossible to find in retail stores. Buying the complete stimulator and handle is wasteful. Received promptly and as advertized.
4,Let's Duplicate CD's and Make money!,"I just got into the trace thing and I was looking at CD's through Amazon. Then I stumbled across this one and found something interesting about it. It's the exact CD I have but with a different name and at a higher price!The name of the CD I own is ""The World of Dream and Trance"" and it part of a whole ""world of"" series that (ZYX Music) puts out... and all of the CD's that they publish are 2 CD sets.Overall this is a good CD with some good progression and not too much of the hardcore Techno-like trance. My personal favorites are: (1-3. Lost in Paridise by Safron) (1-9. Like to Jam by Mateaux) (2-1. Surrounded by Freezer)FYI, I like the semi-dreamy trance with a really catchy melody. For the money I payed, it was a good CD set. It's by far not ""The Best Trance Anthems Ever!"" which is probably the best CD set I have ever heard."
5,Great Book,"Great book for the shotgun sport shooter or hunter. Bob Brister is was a master shooter, hunter, and shotgun expert!"
1,Not recommended!,"I had high hopes for this book, but it did not deliver. Endless pages of experiments, all to prove the same point. The book itself is very poor quality, printed in black and white on very cheap paper. Looks like it was printed in the 1800's.Try ""Successful Shotgunning"" by Peter Blakely, which I also purchased."
1,received old chocolate/already expired,this chocolate never worked...didn't melt correctly and then i noticed that it had expired! i've never gotten the fountain to operate correctly.
4,This game kicks!!!!!!!,"I was thinking of a good system for Christmas to ask for. The PS2, gamecube, or xbox, so i got PS2. The best system ever. THis game has realistic surfing,GREAT graphics, and the characters look life like. If you want to spend ...bucks on a great game, this is the way to go."
3,"Sturdy, but bulky","The case is really sturdy, but it is suppose to fit the 'super shallow' guitar. It fits in there perfect, but there is a lot of wasted space on the case that is really bulky. From the outside you'd think there is a really fat guitar in there, but when you open it you wonder ""what is under where the guitar goes?!?!"" Unless you are planning a u-hall truck to fall on it (it is REALLY sturdy), consider something somewhat smaller."
3,This game requires reading.,"Since this game requires reading, it just collects dust and is much too complicated for our toddler. Box indicates Early Childhood rating."
2,Great Production Value But Very Misleading,"I watched this when it aired on History Channel in January. It looks great - you can see where they spent your cable subscription and ad dollars - and they interviewed some interesting people, many of who certainly deserve to be heard ... but then the producers use narration and fast cut editing to prevent them from expressing themselves accurately!The experts are denied the chance to really go into any depth and the editor chose soundbites that are as sensational as possible. These people have much more to say and they say it fully and clearly in ""2012: Science or Superstition"" (recommended alternative or supplemental viewing).2012: Science Or Superstition"
4,Good but a little hyped,"I will try to avoid repetition of past reviewers but I wanted to say that this was an interesting documentary. The issue that I have with it (as with other documentaries) is that it strongly favors a lot of superstitious, end-of-the-world scenarios. The meaning of the Nostradamus quatrains is still heavily debated, since it is all in code and cannot necessarily be taken at face value. I enjoyed the documentary but it definitely gets one stirred up a bit.There's another documentary,2012: Science Or Superstition, that gives a bit more about world enlightenment, etc, rather than just strictly different ways Earth can get blown up. When it comes to the Mayan calendar theory, no one can even translate the Mayan language 100%, too much of the material has been destroyed. If you watch this documentary, don't let yourself get riled up by it."
3,ok i hate her but...,"so this dvd is ok if youre into brit brit. some ""live"" performances (well we can't deny that the dancing is live, but the singing.....?) and a couple videos, as well as some specials (and lets face it, brit is quite ""special""). i actually didnt buy this, but want to encourage brit brit's fans to buy it for the bonus audio cd. the two non-album cuts are excellent. ""dont hang up"" and ""the answer"" are both so good that 1) i can't believe they are brit brit songs, and 2) i can't believe they were left off the album when piece of s**t songs like ""shadow"" and ""brave new girl"" were included. once again, i hate brit brit, but can appreciate the dirty pleasure of her recent album and think this is a must-have for any fan. and the remixes are pretty ok too."
5,I love it,"I received the DVD in perfect condition and in a really quick amount of time. I'm collecting all of Britneys DVDs and though i purchased this one years ago, i obviously didnt take care of it and scratched it up and eventually lost it. Glad to have a brand new copy to enjoy."
4,Britney Spears rocks,"Britney Spears is my favorite living entertainer. Since she came out in '98-'99 when I was in 8th grade, and she's the epitome of a successful superstar sensation! This DVD shows the real Brit, how funny, entertaining and easy-going she is. Miss Spears isn't just a fancy business woman who is now the world's most famous female; she's human too. She should've won sooo many Grammys already, peeps!"
5,Give Her A Chance,"Nope - she's not the greatest singer in the world, but she puts on one helluva show. Up until ""In the Zone,"" the only thing I liked about Britney was her video for Stronger. Then she came out with I'm A Slave for You (granted, the Vanity 6 hook caught my attention), and I knew that her next endeavor would be worth purchasing. And it was. So now we are at the DVD. I watched that ABC Special and was elated to see it included on the DVD. Teaming up with Madonna on Me Against the Music was brilliant and you gotta be comatose not to like the video for Toxic. All included here. What makes a good DVD are the extras. Well, the extra CD is well worth the remixes found on it. It's time to give Britney a chance. It's not like she's going anywhere."
5,I LOVE BRITNEY,"I definitely recomment this DVD of Britney Spears. She truly shows her talent, her music, her singing, how she dances. She's an amazing artist who's music has inspiring lots of people!Every fan of Britney Spears should have this DVD on their collection. Her special on ABC is amazing! The making of her video ""TOXIC"" was something awesome.I love this DVD. I'm a huge Britney Spears fan!"
2,Disappointing,The concert footage is uninspired and her singing when she does sing is awful. She sings like a drag queen would if they used their real voice.Her dancing is great as usual.I am a fan of Britney and I haven't even watched the whole thing all the way through.Ho hum...
1,"Ah....here we go again,,,BRIT.","Okay...i just bought and watched this DVD, and i was not expecting what i just saw. This DVD is really not one of Brit's BEST DVD's. I really dont urge others to buy it, at all. It would just be best to rent it, b/c it's really a waste of money. Although, i did like the making the VIDEO and the two music videos, other than that, nothing facinating, just BRITNEY trying to sing, when she really can't! (LIVE PERFORMANCE OF ""SOMETIME"", whatever!)Ulysses ."
1,What a mess.....,"For one thing America spends way too much time worshiping this Madonna wannabe. Let's face it Madonna at least has mediocre talent. Ms Spears is talentless, she has a flat voice that is parallel to her stiff as a board dance moves. It's obvious on this album that while Spears is trying to find her nitch America keeps feeding her ego, allowing her to create the most flavorless entertainment out there and it's revered as classic. It's ashame that other artists have to overdose to have thier talents recognized meanwhile we have to be high in our own zones to get into her's. Not even the bonus DVD can save this release. What a waste of money!"
3,EXPECTED MORE,"I am a Britney Spears fan, but after seeing this DVD, I am kind of disappointed. Britney is a HUGE artist... She should make a more in depth DVD. This DVD is literally put together. Most of the DVD is from the ABC Special (which I have seen before it was released on DVD) Making a DVD by re-releasing a special on TV is not that impressive... Her live in Las Vegas DVD has so much more to offer. It seems like Britney put more dedication for her previous DVD. In the Zone is a great CD and the DVD should reflect it as well. Britney you can do better than this... I am sorry but this has to be the truth. You are losing fans if you don't make a DVD that has more quality... THINK QUALITY not QUANTITY!!!If you get the DVD with the Bonus CD, the CD is not bad of a listen... so it makes up for the lazy worked on DVD. Britney get back in the Zone!!!"
3,Just okay,"I'm not a big fan of Britney Spears, but I thought it was neat how she performs some of her songs, and how it shows behind the scenes of her video's, interviews, etc. This D.V.D. is fun for young kids, or anyone that enjoys her music."
3,"This dvd is OK, depending on what you like...","I am a Britney fan, and I have Britney Live in Las Vegas, and Britney Spears Live and More! as well as this latest dvd....While this one is good and very enjoyable, she continues her streak of non-singing, which to some is a turn-off in a dvd, or a plus b/c you can hear the words, and it is clear. Anyway, I prefer live singing on dvd, at least it makes you feel like you are at the concert!The dvd itself is pretty good. If I had to rank the dvds in order, this one would fit second behind Live and More...This dvd has both videos out at that time (MATM and Toxic) Making the Video:Toxic, 2 MTV performances (MATM, Boom Boom) and the ABC concert special, intermitent with Britney talking clips, like on live and more...there are also extras, like a photo gallery, and the free bonus cd of mixes and a few new songs!Over all, for around $10-15 this is a pretty good deal, and a fun dvd, but sometimes the non singing weirds you out, honestly!"
5,Loved It,"I bought this for my 9 year old daughter, who just adores Britney Spears. She loves it, she must of watched this DVD like 20 times. Britney's songs are just fabulous. I love In the Zone, Toxic, and Boom Boom. My daughter loves the karaoke version of Toxic and has sang along tons of times. Britney Spears is really an amazing person, I love her personality, she is sexy but in a sweet way, which is why I love her."
5,Amazing,"I dont often like music DVD'S, but this one will knock your socks off. Great performances, and an amazing collective album to go with it. Its just great! a must have for any britney fan."
4,Good exercise video for beginners,"It is an excellent exercise tape from the standpoint of stretching, strenghtening, balance, cool down and instructions for beginners. The problem is the title says cardio and I didn't get much of a workout in that area. I hope they come out with a companion tape that goes further in the cardio area.I felt it is more of an instructional tape in proper form for beginners. I found it very relaxing and felt stretched out and good about myself after following it."
1,Shaolin Snooze Box,This has got to be the worst workout tape I've ever used. The title is completely misleading. This was a very slow-paced workout with no cardio whatsoever. Don't buy this if you want to work up a good sweat.
1,This book was not what I thought it was about...,"The flower essences referenced in the book are ONLY Master's Flower Essences. This book is of no use to me since I don't use MFE's. However, this could have been my error by not thoroughly perusing the available information (excerpts, title page, etc.). Personally, think the title is deceiving. It's sort of a sub title of a sub title, that states (in very small print on the cover) ""Featuring The Original Master's FLower Essenses. I thought, great...I'll learn about these essences too..but it was ONLY these. The seller was GREAT ~ super fast shipping ~ would by from her again!! This book just does not suit *my* needs. If you use MFE's...and want to learn more, in depth descriptions...it's easy to read and practical."
1,If You Only Knew?,"The last two folks got it spot on someone bring out the album with ""If you only knew"" on it and we will all be happy."
2,Lackluster exercises,"Unless this is your first exercise book, chances are you will be familiar with most of the material presented herein. So -1 star for lack of originality. Furthermore, a lot of the exercises are plain boring, to put it bluntly. There goes another star from the rating.There is not much instruction per se, so the student is more or less left to figure out most of the technical issues on his own. Another star subtracted!If you can practice this stuff diligently for a longer period of time without falling asleep, you'd probably see some technical improvement. But really, there are many other books that will be a lot more fun to work with. This book is outdated."
4,Good product,I think it was a little too pricey for the amount they give. You could try taking a cardboard box and cutting a perfect circle but it probably won't look like this. I just got lazy and bought it.
4,Perfect,Just as described and perfectly sturdy. But I think a bit overpriced for the purpose. I've used these to support tiers on various cakes.
1,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING,THE PACKAGE MADE IT TO ME ON TIME AND WAS PACKAGED WELL BUT WHEN I OPENED IT I WAS EVER SO DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT I GOT. IT IS SMALLER THAN AN ACTUAL SAUCER.
4,Kinetronics Anti-Static Gloves,"I wouldn't say that these are great gloves, but certainly adequate for computer use. They do run a bit small, so be advised. I just ordered the next size up. I feel they provide good feel when working with small screws and other components. For the money, I feel they are cheap insurance."
4,Great,"I really like this DVD. I find it's the next best thing to taking a dance class. Just be sure to stretch and warm up first, there is no warm-up or cool-down on here, just dance. The choreography is great, each piece tells a story. It's not for beginners - pretty fast paced. There are three routines on here and I really like the first one and the last one."
3,MANUFACTURER CHANGE,"I have owned many pieces of this pattern for several years. Over the years pieces occasionally get chipped and so I order this set to have plenty of good pieces. After washing them and starting to put them away in my cabinet, I discovered the the new ones are different from all of the pieces that I previously own. The pattern was exact, and the sizes were the same in that a 9"" plate is nine inches. However, I discovered that the new ones were considerable thinner. In fact, substantially thinner. They look funny stacked in the cabinet with the old ones. So, if you are buying these to add to older Caleca, be warned the new ones are much thinner."
2,Arrived Damaged,Product arrived with one damaged article. Amazon has no ability to replace just the damaged piece. Got a credit of $20 and a new project trying to hunt down one mug.
2,Boring Puzzle,"I could not finish putting it together as it bored me so. I prefer the ""A is for..."" series. Probably just my personal taste."
1,Bought this for Mother.,"She thought she would like it as she likes puzzles, mystery stories, and New Orleans. Story was trivial and she didn't like the puzzle."
5,Excellent Gum Massager,"I've used this tool for many years. It is excellent for massaging the gums between the teeth. It is an essential part of my self-dentalcare routine for keeping my gums healthy. I have had gingivitis in the past, but no more. I bought this one to keep in my travel toiletry bag. It is impossible to find in any local store, so ordering it on-line is the only way."
2,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"These ""flossing aides"" are actually small rubber tips that can be inserted between the teeth to clean areas commonly missed by regular brushing and flossing. As a dentist I recommend this type of product to anyone that has existing gum disease where the gums are inflammed and perhaps have receeded and created spaces between the teeth. I prefer the bristle brush tips to rubber though.I don't recommend that one abandons flossing by using this product, as the rubber tips do not clean the contact points between the teeth at all. The contact points are areas where cavities can form in-between the teeth. Therefore, continue to brush and floss.Compared to other interdental cleaners, I believe this to be an inferior product, as it has a rubber tip instead of bristles. Bristles or a modified toothpick (Stim-u-dent) work better than this product.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"
4,pretty good game,"I spent 15$ on this game and think it's very worth it.The fight system is extremely creative, the 2 player mode is tons of fun and character advancement makes it all the better.I find it very annoying when you cant heal after using your weapon.offensive and defensive should be seperate.Other than that, graphics and sound are great, just dont give up."
1,...awful...,"This is the most sorry excuse for an RPG game that I have ever played. It has awful graphics, cheesy and fake voice acting, a god-awful battle system(you die so easly in the beginning of the game), and it's got very little replay value. If you just HAVE to play this game, then a weekend rental is the way to go."
1,Worst RPG EVER!,"...The graphics and environment are barely average, the story is rote, and the combat system is easily the worst ever invented. What initially attracted me to this game before it was released was the sheer size of the environments you can explore....and the game is big, but all the vast expanse of this game serves to do is make it seem even more boring and lackluster. ..."
4,"Cold hands, warm heart","I was a little skeptical when I ordered them, but I am quite impressed. I live in the Northeast, and these are perfect for the cold winter days, or even cool windy days. The sound is great, the fit is great. I'd say from -15 to + 40 degrees, they're just right.Bart Carrig"
1,Not selling the rigth one,"I order it thru the gide it sistem ant it say it wil fit my car but it didnt I just waste my time it also when,checking out it say it will deliver 2-3 days and after the,final check,out it say ut will be deliver 10 days later. The need to have a better guided sistem to buy items so you dont end up with the wrong one and dont waste your time"
5,Snow White,"I purchased this game for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. According to her it's fun to collect the items. You have to look really hard to find them. It's challenging enough to be fun but not too difficult. The mini games are like breaks in between each level (or chapter). Even once you are done all the levels, it is fun to do them all again and discover new things. I recommend this game."
3,a little too young,"I bought this game thinking it would be an action packed adventure. It is fun, but the age groups should be for 4-10. You have to collect flowers as you move through the castle, then collect butterflies as you move through the forest, then do a slide puzzle, then go through a series of mazes, then collect more items for a while. You also get to move a deer on cliffs, and catch plates, and do one of the things where the items drop and when they are in piles of 3 they go away, and you do a matching game, and you spray vultures to make them disappear. There are 2 modes: Story and Playground. There are 2 levels: Easy and Challenge. Easy is so unbelievably easy and challenge is a bit harder but still quite easy. Overall it is a pretty good game. I would recommend it to children ages 4-10."
4,Snow white is ok i guess,i brought this game for my 5 year old daughter and she hardly ever plays with it. to me it was a waste of money and i would not recommend this game to someone else.
5,Great price! Buy with confidence!,"Update: Bought in May 2009, dying out November 2009. Buy 2 or 3 givenlow price. OEM battery lasted 2-plus years!Bought for boyfriend's Motorola C261 Tracfone. Must have shippedfast because I didn't even see the package arrive and they're on East Coastand we're in California. It's been over two weeks and he reports it'sholding a charge without any issues. So who cares if this could be a knock-off. It works, ordering from Amazon was convenient and the price was way cheaper than other vendors (saved 9.25% in state sales tax alone). We're being frugal by using a prepaid phone for now, so having inexpensive LI-ION battery replacement is a plus. I have the same Motorola C261 phone, so if I need a new battery, I know where to buy...VibeCellular."
5,Exactly as expected,This is the exact OEM replacement battery for my phone so not much to say about its performance.
2,Irony,"I ordered Two BC60 Lithium-Ion Batteries. The same battery supplied by the manufacturer of my telephone. I received one BC60 and one BC50? The BC60 would not work, the BC50 works!I should have received what I ordered and both should have been in working condition. The BC50 works but does not hold a charge as long as the original."
2,Chinese Forgeries Abound!,"The first thing I'll mention is the blatant lie in the product description. Unless Motorola has started packaging their batteries for ""retail"" in plain unmarked plastic bags, this item was most definitely NOT ""Motorola Retail Packaged""Also the battery life in both my and my wife's SLVR is now LESS than it has been with the stock BC50 battery, which is marked as a 700mah, compared to the 820 or so of the BC60.This and the different font used on one of the warning on the new batteries themselves strongly leads me to believe that this Amazon reseller (webtreo sent us ours) is buying these from an illegal Chinese ""cloner"" and that Motorola has nothing to do with these batteries other than giving the forgers a target."
3,Short charge life,"Bought a Motorola BC60 Lithium-Ion Battery for what I thought was a good price, but now understand why it was so cheap. The battery doesn't hold a charge very well and is totally drained after around only 20 minutes talk time. I'm disappointed but learned a lesson, you get what you pay for."
1,not please,"i am not please with the battery ,it is not holding the charge i charge it overnight and once i turn the phone on the longest it will last i about three hours.even the older one is lasting longer than this one,so i not happy."
1,Don't waste your money,These replacement batteries last only 24 hours before they run out of juice which is worse than the battery I was replacing.
3,Buy it if you must,"I would never have bought this book if my guitar teacher hadn't insisted. It is way to complex for someone trying to learn how to read music on their own.However, it works VERY well with my teacher. He prescribes the many exercises for me to practice as I simultaneously learn to play and read music.I understand that this method is supposed to be the best."
5,Method review,This series is excellent. There is a vast amount of information here but I would recommend 2 things:-Buy the books one at a time. It will take near to 2-3 years to get to the 3rd book.-Do these books with a teacher. There is an incredible amount of information that you miss by doing the books yourself.
3,BMM,"Okay-I got this book because I needed to work on my skills. This isn't really isn't the book for that-there are many more direct& effective ways to learn much faster. The cool thing is that this book is intended for guitar & has no tab so it's great work for your reading (because I as many other guitar players are deficient when it comes to reading).It's not a bad book but getting the three in one might be intimidating. There are times I looked at it & just put it down due to the size-then again, it's a personal psychological thing."
2,"Lots of material for cheap, but not too helpful","Some books go into too much detail, some not enough. This book does not go into any detail. It gives you a sheet of music and says ""play this until you have it down"" well, for beginners, you are like, how do you play it? I would have liked more detail and pictures and maybe a little life in the book."
2,not the best,"is better to start music lessons with a teacher and then jump to advanced books, this one is too hard to follow for a new guy and for a musician with a little experience becomes too bored.. music teacher is better...they can clear your doubts better than this book..."
4,Great for guitar study... but not without flaws.,"I'm currently using this book for my guitar lessons, and so far it's been really helpful. It provides useful exercises for both left and right hand as well as technique for both hands. The little snip-its for new exercises is short and to the point and makes sense. The only thing that I don't like about the book are: the binding is somewhat weak, and I would have much rather preferred a spiral bound version; there are some ""typos"" in certain pieces, one which I found to be kind of funny as the chord to be played read as FABbD in first position, which is quite impossible, but it's not so terrible that I couldn't figure out the real chord; there are some occasions in which note values are written wrong, and you'll find that in a measure of 4 only 3 and a half notes are accounted for. Aside from these flaws, this is an excellent book for guitarists of all levels, and is a nice packaged 3-in-1 deal."
5,A Challenging and Rewarding Method!,"In my opinion, the best book that you could possibly buy if you're 1.) interested in improving dramatically at guitar, and 2.) willing to abandon 'fluffy' methods of guitar practice and work hard. Leavitt covers a variety of topics, including rhythm techniques, moveable chord and scale shapes, and (the emphasis of volumes 2 and 3) chord/scale relationships.A must-have! Note that the entire book is written in standard notation. While some might not appreciate this, serious players will."
2,"First Impression of "" Modern Method for Guitar""","Most important. This is an academic pub ... meaning that it leaves out detail to make it challenging. No Tabs to get you up to speed - even the Frets and fingers (page ""1"") is confusing! You must have a teacher to fill in the blanks. (I don't)What's the book about? Teaching you to read music. Might be a nice book for Instructors? Otherwise, do not buy it."
1,Mr. Dull,"I owned the three separate volumes of Mr. Leavitt's ""A Modern Method for Guitar"" many years ago. His approach was outdated then, so I can't imagine what anyone would want with it now. Leavitt redefines ""boring"" in this publication. Why it's still on the market, I'll never know.I struggled through each volume, but learned very little. The exercises are unbelievably onerous. That was many years ago. If you want to learn something inspirational and up-to-date, look elsewhere."
5,Serious guitar learning.,My son's teacher has been using the BERKLEE Method with him for the past year. He completed Volume One and needed to get Volume Two. I found that I can purchase the entire three volumes at a lower price than buying the next two seperately. This is serious work however the results are amazing. Don't believe any books or methods that tell you that you can play guitar in a short time. It takes hard work and learning to really play any instrument correctly. If you want quick results and are happy to strumm a few chords and think you are a guitarist than this is not for you. Plenty of theory and reading lessons are in store for you with this book. Serious students should only use this method. You get out what you put in!
4,great book,this is a great book if you're looking to actually better your reading skills. before using this book i was not the best reader but i have definitely seen improvement in my sight reading. great book for any one who really wants to learn every aspect of how to read on the guitar.
5,"#414, but smallest diameter brush still made","The G.U.M. Proxabrush number is 414, but it has the smallest diameter of any Proxabrush still made and feels like the original number 412 in use (I used them side by side for comparison). For me these work far better than flossing and take much less time."
3,Satisfied with purchase procedure,These brushes are satisfactory however there is a better brush made by GUM. Will use this brush refill when can't get the other one.
1,Not what I wanted.,"Not what I wanted, Iwanted thje extra fine brushes. Got the fine brushes. Finally gave up an accepted fine brushes."
2,G-U-M Proxabrush refills,"There seems to have been a ""redesign"" (cost reduction?) since the last ones of these we had. The wire core seems much thinner and bends so easily that it makes them difficult to use. My other gripe is that shipping cost was excessive. It is charged at almost exactly the price of the product regardless of quantity purchased, even though they are so small and light that postage for eight 8-packs would be only slightly higher than for one - the shipping packaging is most of the weight. Yet shipping for eight 8-packs was almost four times what it would have been for two."
5,"The name changes, but the music still rocks...","Harem Scarem might have changed their name to Rubber, but this CD shows they can still rock, regardless of the name. 2 new songs are added to this group of great Harem Scarem ballads. It's very unfortunate that this band isn't more well known in the US, or even in their home country of Canada, but in Japan they are one of the most loved bands. Also, the great song ""More Than You'll Ever Know"" was left off the track listing, so there's a total of 17 songs on this cd. If you're still a fan of late 80's/early 90's hard rock ballads, this is a disc for you."
3,Don't Get The New Improved Pepsodent,"To the person who said ""it doesn't have a minty taste"". IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO!!! Pepsodent is Supposed to be WINTERGREEN. The new improved Pepsodent that purports to be the original flavor isnt!! For some STUPID reason, they decided to mix peppermint with the wintergreen. I love the Original - Original Wintergreen Pepsodent. Try the NEW pepsodent if you want mint. I DON'T!!"
4,doggie downers,"I can't believe that they work ! They are great for traveling, vet visits, nail trimming, fireworks. I love them !"
3,NaturVet Quiet Moments Calming Aid Chewable,"It's been 2 to 3 weeks since I started giving this product to my 9-yr-old male yorkie, and so far I don't see much of a difference in his behavior. He is a rescue,(with some general anxiety) and is still barking for no apparent reason, and seems nervous at times. I am giving him 1/2 tablet once daily per directions on bottle. Would like to try 1 tablet daily, but not sure if this is wise. I will use the rest of the bottle, but not buy another unless I see an improvement."
5,The finest two albums of Dot's together for the first time!,The latest in the series of Dorothy Squires' releases by the President label is quite simply magnificent. It combines two of her best selling LP's from the sixties - Say it With Flowers and The Seasons of. This singer was once Britain's highest paid entertainer and Elvis himself used to sneek into her concerts! The CD contains superb standards such as We'll Gather Lilacs and Apple Blossom Time to her own self penned masterpieces of love and life - Where Can I Go and of course the renowned title song. The arrangements are by the late Nicky Welsh and the CD comes complete with a superb illustrated booklet. See for yourself why Dorothy Squires held a massive legion of fans for over 60 years!
5,POSTITIVLY ADDICTIVE!,"This game is amazing. I think it must secretly relese some addictive substance into the air while being played! I spent something like 5 consecutive hours playing and i had no idea it had been so long! The plot is by no means deep, and the animation is in no league close to FFX (another great game) but it's still fun. Battles are tough enough to hold intrest but not so hard that you are ready to turn the disk into a frisbee. One of the things i love about the game is that your monsters constantly evolve and oyu can merge them as many times as you like to make them stronger. Plus, by merging, you can either upgrade their skills or give them new ones. There is a huge selection of beasts so you can choose what your ultimate team will be- there is no ""best or storngest"", you make your monsters what they are. If you want hours of entertainment without a lot of stress and anger, this is the game for you!"
3,Not for mature gamers,"Jade cocoon is cute. Graphics are above average. Creating strange looking beasts was interesting. The girl rock stars are adorable. On the other side of the coin, the cartoon bubbles depicting the characters while speaking are redundant and annoying. Lack of variety in character's movements is boring. In my opinion the creaters of this game should have rated this game for a younger crowd. It's too slow for a mature gamer."
4,The Only RPG worth anyone's time!,"I can't speak for everyone, but most RPG games really aren't very good. This one is different. It is the only RPG that I actually enjoy playing. It has the perfect balance between strategy and action, with just the right amount of back story to really tie you in. This game is amazing. It is one of my all-time favorite video games to play. Try it and see what I mean."
5,Mood Music,"I found this album to be a wonderful arrangement of different artists and moods that are ideal to do power yoga to, as well as for contemplative listening. It is mostly instrumental, although there is one chant akin to Buddhist chants. Unlike many of the traditional yoga CD's, this does not go on endlessly on any one tack, and you could just as easily imagine listening to this at happy hour while looking out across the ocean.This is my second purchase of this CD. The first one was destroyed by an errant CD player."
5,I recommend any of the Pacific Moon collections,"This is great relaxing ""background"" music. Unobtrusive, interesting, and exotic. Loved it."
1,Frostbit,"Frost or Kid Frost is one of the biggest Latino rappers / emcee hailing from East Los Angeles, California and this release That Was Then, This Is Now Vol. 1 was a major disappointment. The problem is originality. There are too many hooks and lyrics being stolen and that's bad. On to the brighter side, there are a few gems here but not enough to save this lp. ""Outlaws"" featuring Kurupt & King T is a good song of West Coast gangster love. Bay area's B-Legit & Richie Rich helped out on the banging ""Heart Of A Savage"". The actual icing for Frost was the orchestrated ""Big Business"" featuring Xzibit & Jayo Felony. Those alone are worth checking out this release."
4,"Finally he's back! Frost, the mexican rap vet.","Frost is back with a slammin', thrump tight album. It has so much heat, you won't believe it! He spits some reality rhymes about the life of an O.G. in East L.A. He got some fresh guest artists featuring together with him too. People like Richie Rich, B-Legit & Roger Troutman (R.I.P.). Tracks like ""Mamacita"" & ""Diamonds & Pearls"", makes this a bomb-classic of its own. Go out and get this shit. It will definitely blow your mind..."
2,Diversity Issues Book,"It was in great condition. However, the package that it was shipped in was not in good condition. I would have used a box instead of an envelope."
3,Single Plus Filler and Killer Remake,"Major Leagues is an EP to be filed under single plus filler. Both the single edit and the demo version of ""Major Leagues"" from Pavement's Terror Twilight are worth owning (the single mix is cleaner than the CD version; the demo demonstrates a good song in its simplest form). The unreleased tracks are defiant B-sides (the French-speaking ""Decouvert de Soleil"" is a hoot). The best reason to own this single plus filler are the remakes. Pavement, no slouches in the innovation department, prove that The Fall are virtually uncoverable - the cadences of ""The Classical"" were written to spec for Mark E. Smith's delivery. It's a lesson in stubborn wrongheadedness. But their cover of Echo and the Bunnymen's ""The Killing Moon"" is inspired. Pavement invests the hyper-romanticism of the song with their ironic distance; the tug of war between the two fascinates, with romance trumping irony in the final round. The struggle is thrilling."
3,Red rocks regraded picture???,"Ok, i won't get into the famous u2 red rocks performance , we all know its great. But this review focuses on the dvd release itself.. First off, the sound mix is great. but the picture is another story. It claims to be remastred and regraded picture, but its not that great. First off its got the one thing i hate about bad remastering dvds (GRAIN).. and its really bad on the sections that are from the original, but the added songs which are mostly in the beginning look better. Out of control , twilight, two hearts and into the heart.. look fine. but you can tell a diffrence in picture on these songs compared to the rest... I just really hate grain.... surprised they didnt notice this. oh well, at least its on dvd.... and the colors are a tad washed out..."
4,The Climbing scene,"Without having gotten the DVD yet, and after reading someone else's comment. All that I have to say is that is a shame they edited all the climbing scene during Cry/The Electric Co.Those who have watched or listen to bootlegs concerts from the early days, know that climbing until the top of the stage was the part of the show that excite the crow the most. Bono and his famous stunts that ended on a fight in a LA show back in 1983.About the grainy stuff. C'omon, cameras were not the same back in 1983 and who had thought back them that we would have DVD and LCD tvs now in 2008."
3,Didn't they mean DE-graded picture?,"I've waited years for this to hit DVD officially.I've bought a bootleg DVD sourced from the laserdisc.....and I also transferred my VHS tape onto DVD.Both of these versions look better (clearer, cleaner) than the 'official' DVD release.What a let down! I really don't understand it. WHY? WHY? WHY?5 stars for the performance/film......1 star for the reissue.Buy a bootleg on eBay instead."
5,"Raw, Fiery, Blistering!","The cover art perfectly sums up the concert as described.This was filmed at the Red Rocks amphitheatre, way before U2 became stylized, glamorous stadium rockers. The hairstyles are super dorky and Bono shows some hot ass under skin tight black jeans, takes his shirt off and pulls a lady fan up to dance.The sound is LOUD, the music RAW and the then up and comers full of passion and fire. In comparison, the group seems somewhat fatigued in the 360 DVD.This 2008 remaster and reissue of U2 Live At Red Rocks Under A Blood Red Sky also includes some previously unreleased performances:Cry/The Electric CoAn Cat Dubh/Into The HeartTwo Hearts Beat As OneI highly recommend this and Zoo TV. I think these are their best DVDs."
5,Missed the original concert by one day,"Missed the original concert by one day, but was so glad that I could watch it all the years later and see what I missed"
5,Only for the true U2 fans!!!,"U2 at the most raw.Its the best of all the concert!!A must watch for those who wants to know who U2 really is and also I reconmend the book ""The unforgetable fire-The story of U2 by Eamon Dunphy"".It says it all bout them.."
3,A travesty that U2 fans will not soon forget,"The Edge remixed the sound for this DVD, and I love Edge, but he did a really poor job on the mix... and the really odd thing is that the poorest thing about it is how low his guitar is (perhaps he's become too modest?!). One of the great things I remember from watching the VHS over and over was his guitar and what it did for U2's sound: the great tone he gets, and the drama and dynamics he contributes to the music.Another HUGE problem is that the high point of the show, a stirring version of ""Electric Co."", has been heavily edited. There was originally a long and moody mid-section to this which was chopped out for the DVD.The original VHS was a classic. The DVD version seems tame... and lame."
4,Finally!,"Finally this is out on dvd. The conert is excellent, the band rocks!The producers did let things down on one hand though. At first I thought someone must have scribbled lipstick over the camera lenses, as that is exactly what the image looks like through-out the lighter (early evening) part of the show. The English director(?) in his commentary explains that this was the result of the cameras suffering burn-in when they had a stage light shine straight in. It was exactly the same effect they got on their TV show ""The Tube"" at home in northern UK, and they like the connection.Until I learnt this I was puzzled as to why a 'remastered' dvd would have such an artifact. I would suspect the vast majority of viewers have never seen The Tube and the lipstick will be an annoying distraction where none is necessary. The show stands on its own two feet without gimmicks!Well worth it regardless."
4,U2 Live at Red Rocks,"U2 in their early days. You could tell there was something special in this band. I don't really dig U2 now, but back then...Wow! My friends and I saw this concert back when MTV didn't suck, and we were hooked! Funny, that just a few years back, a friend and I were wishing they would make a DVD of the Red Rocks concert...and they did! I was a little hesitant that the audio would not be up to standards, but they did a great job. Visually, it's exactly what I wanted it to be...just like it was back then. Great job, guys. Well worth the $$$$."
3,Can anyone help with this,I just purchased the cd/dvd combo but when i played the dvd i noticed some red lines on my screen? is this normal for the type of recording that they did for this concert? I would just like to know? If anyone can help it will be great!
2,"No..no the cut the middle of ""Electric co.","Finally..finally i was waiting years for the DVD..i was the only one who had the tv version on video which had songs not on the original VHS and ""The Electric Co"" was one..WHY DID THEY EDIT THE SONG HERE!!! the whole ""send in the clowns"" middle was cut!!! why?? they can't say..malfuction..I HAD IT AND IT'S ON YOU TUBE, this is why my family and i are so fed up with new DVD releases. They think we are all fools and would not notice the cuts. I'm sending mine back. That's why only two stars..would have been 50 stars but they had to cut stuff..un-real."
3,Video quality,"I am huge U2 fan, but I have to say, I was shocked when I put this DVD in my player to watch. I love the sound, but I just can't get past the fact that for some cameras angles, on most of the songs, the video has streaks/lines going thru the entire screen. If these are lines that were the result of the method used to tape the show, fine. However, one would think if they transferred the original video to a digital copy, that they could tidy up the lines and remove most of them (or cover them up with color that matches the background?).Can someone confirm that this is the way the DVD looks, or is it possible I purchased a bad DVD?"
1,Disappointing Puzzle & Mystery,"My husband & I have enjoyed mystery jigsaw puzzles for at least 18 years. This is the first one we found ourselves unable to complete. Over one-third of the pieces were identical in color which meant you had to sort each piece by trial and error. The mystery story in and of itself was mediocre and under no circumstances could anyone guess the solution. All in all, this puzzle was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and not at all in keeping with the usual quality of the BePuzzled series."
3,Fragile Tricycle,"My two year old daughter and I used the ""Ultimate Trike"" for a week until one of the steering cables broke. (I could turn only to the right). Big disappointment to spend $80 in a tricycle from Radio Flyer that last one week.I visited the RadioFlyer customer service web site (http://www.radioflyer.com/support/customer_service.html) and filled out a ""part replacement"" form. The next day a Customer Service Representative (Anshu Aul) contacted me and informed me that she will send me a replacement cable for free. She also explained that RadioFlyer made an improvement on the cable to make it more robust.In summary:Great product (when it work), but shame on RadioFlyer to introduce a fragile product to the market that doesn't represent the brand image (Good, robust, quality products almost indestructible). I hope that the improvement on the cable save the reputation and the performance of this tricycle."
2,Cheap build,"This started out as a good ride but went downhill pretty quickly. The steering mechanism is a very poor design and broke after only a few months of use. The piece that holds the steering cables is made of plastic and quickly cracked under the strain of you trying to countersteer from your child. The manufacturer was good about replacing it and sent new parts quickly, however the trike never worked the same after that. Also, the front wheel mechanism was always squeaking no matter how much grease you try to put on it. Right now it sits unused in the garage in pieces. One of these days I'll recycle it to the trash heap where it belongs. There are much better rides out there."
1,taking it back tomorrow...,"this thing has NEVER worked... the cable broke right away. We have had it for maybe a month. In a months time, we have struggled with it and basically hate the thing by now.I thought Radio Flyer was a good name brand too... ????I do not recommend. Our Daughter is two. Got it for her b-day in April and we are finally getting the reciept from the gift-giver and taking it back. We asked for this item, thought it would be fun.NOPE!needless to say the german bike/trike is our next buy."
2,"Not the ""Ultimate Family Trike""",My daughter is only 2 years old. She has only ridden her trike 3 times and the cable has already broken. Getting replacement was a pain. What happened w/ the quality of Radio Flyer. I bought this based on the name brand!!!!
4,Great tricycle NOT a Great stroller,I originally was going to purchase the Radio Flyer trike with the single handle that controls the steering until I read the reviews on here. I then purchased this one for my two year old son. We put it together and it seemed great. Tonight we went out for a walk and the handle kept turning to the right as all that is holding it in is a silver peg. It is a major pain to steer and the handle twists in the holder so you can not steer it at all. I would not recommend it at all.
1,Disappointed with Radio Flyer,"My son received this as a gift from grandma. We thought, being that it was Radio Flyer, that meant quality. Boy, were we wrong. The steering was completely stripped after one use by my 2 year old. I took it back and am awaiting a new Kettler to be built. Hopefully, this one will be better. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BIKE!!! Very poor quality.I also called Radio Flyer before returning the bike and they offered little assistance. However, at the store it seems to be a regular problem as all of the Radio Flyer trikes that they carried had stripped handle bars."
2,Not very happy!,"This toy is not made well, very wobbly, and does tip over easily! We bought this when our old fashioned radio flyer was broken by and older sibling and wished I would have never bought this one. I will be donating and going back to the traditional radio flyer. This was a waste of money!"
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this bicycle for my 1 year old daughter so that I could push her around. The rear handle does not control the steering. The seat is so small that it only provides a little ledge for her bottom. The pedals only go in one direction. If you pick up the bike from the handle bars, it pops right out of the front wheel component. It is not very sturdy. Maybe it will ride better as a tricylce when she gets older."
2,Not what we expected!,"We bought this for our son when he was 18 months old! The Stroller option lasted all but 3 months and snapped! We are not even able to get any replacement or a way to fix it! To use as a trike it is not all that convenient either! The wheel has some kind of system that will let the pedals go freely and when my son tries to pedal backwards, nothing will happen. It is not easy to explain to a 2 and a half year old that if we wants to back up he needs to get off the bike and turn the bike around! I would not recommend it, it is expensive and does not hold what it seems to promise!"
1,Cable problems,"As another person stated, I also requested a new set of cables for the trike after the first set broke. They were great about it. But the new cable lasted only about 4 rides before it snapped, too. It took my husband over and hour to get the new cable in, and we were very careful to do it correctly. Very disappointing that they used such a cheap part for an otherwise well made, and expensive toy. Don't buy it: it's not worth the tears of your tyke when it breaks!"
1,Don't Buy This Bike!,THERE ARE NO BREAKS ON THIS BIKE! The adult stearing bar option is the toddler's only hope for safety. Remove the walking bar and the toddler has an independent little bike. NO!!! Bikes have breaks. Not this one. My son had to drag his feet on the sidewalk ringing the bell while I chased after him grasping his seat to slow the bike to a stop. Thank goodness he was wearing a helmet.
1,What a pile of junk!,"My 2 year old ran over to the neighbor's yard yesterday, where he found a brand new Radio Flyer #48 Ultimate Family Trike. At first I told him not to climb on it, but my neighbor said it was ok, so I loaded him on and began to push him around the yard (a flat yard, mind you). Upon deciding to pivot the Trike to change direction, the darn fool plastic that joins the adjustable steel tube handle snapped like a twig in my hand. SNAP! Unbelievable. Well, I guess I can buy my neighbor another one, now. As someone who is keenly attuned to product design, I can tell you that this is NOT one that was intended to last. Save your money. Very disappointing for a company with so many other great offerings and such a fantastic reputation."
4,All the bliss that is Afro inspired House music.,"Twelve tracks, unmixed, this CD feature's a collection ofHi's (King Street/Nitegrooves guru) latest gems. Track one, MORE THAN GOLD (Shelter Mix) succeeds in both name and delivery although a bit stretched. The ruff, ragga vocal delivery adds to the tracks unique style. How best to describe this album? Afro Beat meets Jazz meets house. And the point where they intersect is pure bliss. Track 5, WATCH THEM COME by Men from the Nile featuring Peven Everett. ""They come and they come From the around the world"" Another crowd pleaser, Cascades of Color (Journey to Color Mix) by Ananda Project featuring Gaelle Addison. ""Sunrise and the sunset when the night falls . . ."" Beautiful 4/4 vocals, soothing track, tight production, excellent delivery. If you are looking for House music incorporating Afro, Cuban and Jazz elements, cop this album for a musical journey evoking the bliss of all that is Afro inspired House."
5,Songs relating to the lure and lore of trains,"In My Mama Was A Train, James Coffey performs fifteen original and traditional songs relating to the lure and lore of trains. Children of all ages (and a great many adult railroad buffs) will enjoy Coffey's highly recommended signature piano, acoustic guitar and harmonic stylings, along with the real sounds and rhythms of locomotive engines accenting and enhancing each piece. The songs include What Do You Hear? (2:39); That Little Red Caboose Behind The Train (3:04); Nine Hundred Miles (3:02); Counting Those Railroad Cars (1:35); Old Engine No. 9 (2:04); Build A Bridge (3:43); Rock Island Line (1:56); Wabash Cannonball (3:15); New River Train (2:15); I'm A Train (1:51); Casey Jones (2:26); Down By The Station (1:36); Little Red Caboose (1:33); Workin' In The Railway Yard (2:58); and the title piece, My Mama Was A Train (2:49)."
5,"Kids will love it, parents will love it","I love kid music that I can enjoy also. (Especially on those long car rides when the kids' music has to be played over and over to keep the little ones content.) The music and lyrics of all the songs on this CD are delightful to adult and child ears alike. The music is cheerful, contemporary, and full of train lore and sounds--a key to its success with the little train fan in our family. This Jim Coffey winner is right on track!"
4,Excellent book...but much has changed!,"Harden brings one of the least reported parts of the world to light, but his reporting is now a bit out of date. It is hard to give a book this good less than five stars, but many things have happened in Africa in the last five years. I would purchase an update in a minute."
5,The BEST book to understand Africa. This should be required reading for everyone!,"Blaine Harden's Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent is by far the most interesting book out there about Africa. It is a series of vignette-like true life examples of how the continent is imploding, thanks to ""big daddies"" and the west's lack of understanding about the people, cultures, values, and even geography of this underdeveloped continent. Truly a masterpeice. It should be required reading in all universities across the country. One of the BEST books I've ever read."
5,A WELL RESEARCHED BIOGRAPHY,"LAURENCE BERGREEN has done a terrific job in all departments. When you finish the book, you have a good idea of who IRVING BERLIN was, and what a life he had from singing waiter to AMERICAN's first great composer with JEROME KERN. Anyone interested in the story of AMERICAN music should read that book."
4,As Thousands Cheer: The Life Of Irving Berlin,"Great. It was amazing to read about this extraordinary life. He was an amazing mix of ambition, drive, talent, patriotism, generosity, selfishness, and love. Most of all, the passion to stay revelant thruout the decades was amazing. And the explosion of talent at that time: Berlin, the Gershwins, Rogers & Hart, Rogers & Hammerstein, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, etc. Throw in WWI & WWII and the cold war and you have it all. A great read."
5,All Star Cast! All Star Playing!,"First lets get some details about this recording: It was recorded in 1983, and featured the tenors of Golson and Pharoah Sanders, Cedar Walton on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. An all star session no doubt.The music has the unmistakable sound of Benny Golson's arrangements, which I always liked. The playing by Sanders is completely in the hard-bop tradition, as is DeJohnette's. The rest are of course natural hard-boppers.Since the album is dedicated to the late great John Coltrane, the music chosen and the style of performance seems as a tribute to Coltrane's 50's recordings.There are no other surprises - everyone plays great, with controlled intensity and original ideas. Review by Nadav Haber"
1,broke at first use,"This fairlead looks like it is a good quality but it broke at the very first use, lifting a snowplow.The bottom roller was completly crushed by the weight.I wrote to the compagny, to get another roller.They didn't respond.So i just turned the fairlead upside down to get another chance and i'm and waiting for the 2nd snowstorm.Good luck with that!"
2,Misleading Debbie,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. I am at an intermediate/advanced level and work out 7 days a week. I have been trying to get this Slim Series for so long and when I finally got it and watched it, it was really disappointing. It did not make me sweat,it was actually quite boring.Debbie seemed to lack sensitivity and was just going through the motions. I am sorry but I really and truly was hoping for more."
5,SUPERB EARLY 30s HOT DANCE BAND,"For the earlier half of the thirties Joe Haymes led a superb band, which recorded for a wide variety of labels, some of which were issued also on their English equivalent. often using pseudonyms. Yet today his musical contribution is almost forgotten, which state of affairs is quite undeserved. This reissue presents a fine selection of his recordings between mid-1923 and mid-1936, and demonstrates what a superbly swinging outfit he led. The excellence of the remastering has produced a warm, rich timbre with a lot of depth, and you'll discover fresh delights in the arrangements each time you listen"
5,Aquinas,Superb clear presentation of the coherent structures underlying Aquinas' thought. Very helpful for us beginners who welcome a succinct guide and map. Not to be missed!
2,Repetitive....Repetitive...Repetitive,"While the book was very intelligent, I found it rather boring. The arguments for communism are basically all the same, just told with different examples. The protagonist's discovery that the word ""I"" is not present in socialism is hardly a revalation to the reader, only to the charcater. This might be an effective book for someone if they were alredy a communist or socialist, but people brought up in the deomcratic and capitalist way of life will find that there are not too many arguments that we have not heard."
2,what's to like?,"if you like this book, more power to you. i wish you well. but, please: shame on the modern library editorial board for choosing this thing as the 8th greatest novel of the 20th century! ridiculous. there is nothing special about the writing, and the whole book is such a heavy-handed ideological sermon, that it is more like a dark dreary pondorous cartoon i wish i had taken no part of. if you like ugly literature, this will be for you."
4,Historical insight necessary,"I jumped into this book knowing nothing of the Moscow trials and found myself historically negligent. The book was good the first time, but after i did some research on the trials the book was even better. From the point of view of a man condemned, I found Rubashov to be excellently written and far superior to one character we can compare him to, Cinncinnatus C. from Nabokov's ""Invitation to a Beheading."""
5,Darkness at Noon,"The book is great! I have to read it for my history class, but it reads not as a chore rather a novel for self pleasure. Can't wait to get it in my hands. I read it every chance I get."
4,Political ideals vs. power and self preservation,An erstwhile revolutionary hero is condemned by the Party he helped to establish. Koestler's indictment of Stalin's ruthless purge decomposes the conflicts of high minded political ideals and the naked desire for power and self preservation.
4,Koestler's Philosophy,"In a tale of a disillusioned communist, Koestler tells his abstract and sometimes outrageous thoughts and answers to questions about human nature. Set primarily in a prison, this novel focuses on the life of Rubashov, a controversial political figure thrown in jail for crimes he didn't commit. While imprisoned, Rubashov reflects on his life and what he has stood for. He begins to question his beliefs. By reflecting many of his beliefs through his characters, we are allowed a glimpse into the mind of Koestler, who himself became disillusioned with the Party. Though simply written, this entertaining novel offers a look at Koestler's life and some historical background on the party. Fueled by Koestler's own philosophical insights, the novel tells an interesting tale about the communist Soviet Union."
4,Dance the Night Away!,"This soundtrack is terrific! I love it because I can dance to the uptempo beats and rhythms of the songs. I even have a hard time not grooving to the few ballads on the CD and it gives the movie, ""Chasing Papi"" a strong pace to follow. Emilio Estefan Jr. was the executive music producer for the album. All of the songs are good, but my super favorites are Celos-Marc Anthony, La Negra Tiene Tumbao sang by Salsa Queen Celia Cruz, Dejare-Christina Vidal, Romeo-Jose Feliciano, and Taca Taca-Gaitanes."
5,Great Party CD!!,"I love this cd!Jon Secada is fun on ""Final Fantasy"" & Joy Enriquez's version of ""Bad Girls"" with rapper El General is GREAT!! Celia Cruz on ""La Negra Tiene Tumbao"" Rocks, thats gotta be my favorite!""Dejare"" by Christina Vidal is good too.The whole cd is really fun, except for the one Jaci Velasquez tune that kind of doesn't flow with the feel of the cd!But you can skip over it.Pick this up if you're gonna have a party or get together with a little latin spice! You'll like it!"
5,Great Latin pop,"I will admit that I have never seen this movie before. A friend of mine had this CD sitting in their car, and after listening to it I just had to have it. This soundtrack is full of great pop songs in English and Spanish that have a great Latin feel to them. It also includes a salsa by Marc Anthony (Celos) as well as a reggaeton from Celia Cruz (La Negra Tiene Tumbao). Overall a great CD to listen to that makes you want to dance. Very enjoyable."
1,Did not last the winter,"Apparently these have a 4-year warranty (but I usually don't save receipts for $15.00 items, especially if they are made out of brass (mostly). I bought TWO of these in the fall, and both broke within days of my turning the water on this spring. The topmost connector broke on each one (wasting gallons of water until I walked outside and noticed.)Gilmour makes a similar product with a LIFETIME warranty. That's what I bought as replacements,"
1,Buyer Beware,"In a nut shell, Orbit products are mostly cosmetic and low quality.Specificaly, in the case of their various hose manifolds, beware of any that contain the words ALUMINUM and BRASS. Aluminum is a sacrifical metal when in conjuction with brass, (or other more noble metal), and the aluminum will desolve due to electrolysis. This can happen within a short few months depending on how often water is flowing through the fitting. When the aluminum finally degrades the fitting will fall apart.I have photographic evidence of such a failure that happened in less than 8 months. One of the lines was decicated to an auto fill for my pond so water was always on and flowing at about a 20 gallon per day rate. Had I not caught the problem just before total failure, the potential for several thousand gallons of water waste was high.This goes for any product, by any manufacturer, that combines aluminum, zinc, and brass in a system of flowing water.Buyer beware! For photographic evidence, please see [...]"
1,"Broken Product, Wasted Water","Less than 2 months ago I installed the Orbit 62010 Brass Hose Faucet Manifold faucet onto a faucet that serves my garden about a quarter of a mile from the house. Today I found water gushing down the hill because the 62010 left outlet had sheared off/broken just above the screw part where the timer attaches. The product is less than 2 months old and having bought it via Amazon rather than local or through a garden vendor, I have no way of returning it to Orbit. A brass faucet should not fail after only a couple of months."
3,Weak plastic parts,This worked well for a year. At the end of the summer the part that screws on to the spigot broke off and cannot be fixed.
1,does not last,"I had three of these and they all broke (the brass part cracked). They were never left out in freezing weather. It looks like a sturdy, quality product but it is not."
2,worked for a year,"I agree with the other poster. I have had and used this product for approximately a year and the uppermost connector has begun to leak/gush. I have two of them and only one has done this so far.I thought it may just need a new washer as the old one looked a little worn. I replaced the washer and the problem still remained.As for freezing temperatures.....I was living in charleston, sc. Not an area that gets freezing weather. As the temp dropped I removed the manifold and put it on a shelf. (no point in having it out when your grass is dormant) I am going to see about getting a gilmore one as well for the lifetime warranty. not sure why this one doesnt have one....It was great while it lasted!!!"
1,Low quality,"These units quickly develop pinhole leaks if you leave your hose charged (for example: for a bird bath dripper), even at low pressure. Don't waste your money."
1,Piece of junk,"Valves are difficult to open and close. After a year or two, they're almost impossible. They break on the inside and outside very quickly."
2,Not the best,"Whilst reading this i wasn't really sure i was reading about the same actor of all these years. Seems weird to me that out of over 300 books the issue of him possibily being a father was brought up in this book. Why hasn't anyone else wrtten about that. he's taken a few things out of other books to make this one, Kazan's ""A Life"" for one!. The Pier Angeli affair is completely inaccurate as its been proven many mnay times how he felt about her as he was seen by a few people at her wedding and spoke to many people about that affair and shared his hurt with them. His best friend Bill Bast being one. That affair was secret at first because of Pier's mother. Jonathan Gilmore wasn't even in Hollywood when it happened, yet he feels he knows everything. I took issue with that and the way he portrayed Jimmy to be like a whore. I lost respect for the author and a bit for Jimmy. i still prefer 'Little Boy lost' by Joe Hyams"
3,Utmost Unjustice to the One of the Greatest Artist,"A record that badly needs to be remastered.Otherwise, it's a unjustice both to the pianist and these sonatas. The recording, as it stands, sounds categorically worse than most records in the 50's, far worse than Oistrakh's Beethoven Violin Sonatas (with Lev Oberin), way worse than those recordings done in Moscow in the same period. Nowadays, we have a lot of transfers from the 78s which sound much better than this one. I happen to own another Sony record by the same artist playing Bach. Likewise, it is impossible? What rough treatment on our invaluable musical heritage!!"
4,I liked the Colgate Platinum Toothpaste. It was ...,"I liked the Colgate Platinum Toothpaste. It was minty but not too overpowering. I have no complaints. The only negative thing I can say is that I prefer gels to toothpastes, but that isn't a big deal. I would recommend this product to anyone."
4,"I've used quite a few whitening toothpastes, and ...","I've used quite a few whitening toothpastes, and this is by far the best. After a couple of days, I could tell a difference in the color of my teeth. And after brushing, it felt like I'd just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. I would highly recommend this product."
4,"It seems more potent than regular Colgate, and ...","It seems more potent than regular Colgate, and leaves my mouth tasting cleaner. However, I haven't noticed any improvements in color. But I've had it for only a week, so it may take longer."
4,"Long wait, but....","I had read about Andiroba Oil in a complementary therapies reference book and wanted to try it for an arthritic problem that worsens with cold weather. It took a month to get to me, but it seems at least comforting to apply warm to my sore hands. The judge is out yet to see if it actually functions as an anti-inflammatory."
3,"Shipping is ""the issue""","I'd love to be able to review the item and may do so when I get it. My problem is with the shipping policy. I ordered the memory on August 11. It was supposed to ship today but (so far) hasn't. Meanwhile, the listing for the memory says ""ships in 1-2 days"" and ""Only 5 left."" This raises all sorts of questions about how Amazon handles inventory management. It is both unclear to me as to when I will get the item and why it is taking so long."
4,Great new wave rock from the 80's,Great new wave rock music from the 80's. Sometimes biting satire presented in humorous format. Excellent production. Top quality sound engineering.
5,Classic Steve Taylor,"I listened to the tape of this album that I had had since High School until the poor thing had been warn out and played to death. Finding the CD was like the icing on my cake this week, between finding Meltdown and Crumbacher's Escape from the Fallen Planet I am in 80's Christian Rock Heaven.*Does happy dance of Joy*"
3,Good DVD,"The stories are fun and colourful and excellent for my daughter. However, I wish the producers had made each episode separate with the Flubberdubbers song at the beginning and end of each."
4,Not bad - done better :-l,"This isn't one of my absolute favourite workouts - I've definately done and seen better, but it's ok and worth trying at least once or twice.There are three segments all with their own warmups, so you can do only one workout, two or all of them. In the first segment, you use a medicine ball, and it includes jumps etc. The second workout uses a stability ball and there are your usual squats and hamstring curls. In the third, you use an X-ertube (which I don't have but you can do this without) and a step. This is the harder of the three segments and you concentrate on your glutes.It's very average and for some reason I just don't find this as motivating or quite as fun as other workouts I've done, and while it's definately worth giving a go, I prefer a Cathe Friedriche workout for lower body. She pushes you a bit harder."
5,Exellent book that will make you and your baby smile,"I cannot say enough good things about this book. The pace of the rhymes give it a very whimsical beat that babies love. The pictures are bright and colorful. Lots of parent/baby interaction can occur while reading the book because there are plenty of things to point at while reading. The book familiarizes or reinforces (depending on the stage of your baby)different sites and senses. I started reading my twins this book when they were 9 months and they are now 20 months and they still love it. As a parent, you won't tire of reading this book, either...because you will be reading it ALOT.BUY THIS BOOK! IT'S A WINNER!"
1,So many incorrect answers,I don't care whether they've been corrected or not. The fact that Kaplan would publish such garbage without proofreading it first reflects very poorly on their company.
1,Errors Errors Errors,I insist that Math books should be totally free of errors. This book has way too many!
2,Filled with errors.,"My son bought this book to prepare for the Math II subject test. The book covered all of the SAT's topics, but the practice sections were horrible. There were errors everywhere. Most of them involved simple algebra, but many were typos. The book would make mistakes like 1+3=2. In many situations the answer key would contradict the answer explanations. On the plus side, the full-length practice tests did not have too many errors, and they gave an pretty accurate prediction of my son's score on the SAT Math II."
5,Brief and Clear,"Although I consider Barron's textbook as full with information, and quite complete, I must say that I was very happy when I received Kaplan's. In fact, the material in there is given in a brief and clear manner. You practically can read the whole textbook in just one day!!! (Of course, I don't advise that, but...)Very easy to read, and to understand. You first pass through a mini-test, and then learn the material by applying it to the exercises you just had. So you easily remember the lesson. I'm quite happy with it.Of course, I am studying from other textbooks too, but I think that if possible, you should pass through this one. And in case you have no time to study at all for the exam -> that's the perfect textbook to quickly learn the main material."
4,what a different latin album,"This album is very different from other latin music I've listend to before. Although it's kinda rock latin, I love ballads such as ""algo mas,"" ""nina.""This is my first time touch this kind of latin music, it really surprise me."
4,Solid CD,I really like this cd a lot. I've been reading recently a lot about 5ta estacion so I decided to buy this cd. Natalia's voice is amazing and the music from Angel and Pablo give a rock vibe to it. I highly recommend it
5,Great series,"I have always loved this series. Allan Cole and Chris Bunch started out with this series, and have gone on to their own works since then, one of them branching out into fantasy fiction.This is the story of Sten, a youth brought up in a tyrannical space colony. His parents are lost at a young age due to a secret project, and he must have his revenge."
3,Sci-fi fun,"A buddy of mine highly recommended this book to me, and so I was very much hoping to enjoy it. On some levels I did, but on others it was a miss.Basically, this is just fun little sci-fi book. It doesn't look like the author was interested in building too much support for his universe, or else he is hoping that you will buy the rest of the series. It felt like he didn't do much planning with the setting...he just picked out one or two ideas that he liked and let the rest build itself.The characters were simple, but still fun. I liked Sten, and didn't really care about much of his motivation. Again, it didn't look like the author gave much thought to the cast, but in this case, I wasn't really bothered by it.The action was amusing, if the reader goes in with the mindset of having fun. If you are looking for literary genius, you'll lose.BTW...I've never seen a scottish accent put down in print before! It was hard to follow!"
1,Not impressed,"I thought the characters were uninteresting, the story silly, the tech was poorly described and poorly utilized by the characters, the close-quarters-combat wildly over the top (Sten kills a mutated tiger that just surprised him by kicking it's throat out?) and the whole thing extremely weak.This takes the ""street kid with a heart of gold"" puts him in the year 5000 (that could be any fantasy world with castles and dragons) and hopes we'll go along for the ride.Didn't work for me. I'm stopping at the first book and I'm glad I borrowed this one."
5,A Great Start to a Great Series,"This is the first of the ""Sten"" series. It's a great sci-fi read with pleanty of classic sci-fi premisies with a few twists.One of the nice things about this series is that it ends. Once you get excited about reading these books and become attached to the characters, you can simply pick up the next book and continue on. There is no waiting through years of writers block or movies deals (a la Robert Asprin and JK Rowling).Yes, it's sad that a series you enjoy ends, but at least you have the sense of completion and closure to the story. Since no series can go on forever it's nice to finish strong.This, as the first installment, is a great read on it's own merits. It's a great story with great characters.If you're a fan of books like Starship Troopers (book NOT movie) and Ender's Game - I think you'll like this book and it's sequels."
4,Butler G-U-M End Tuft Brush,"I cannot find this brush in any of the drug stores in my neighborhood and my dentist no longer carries them , although I'm encouraged to use. So, I ordered a dozen. The price for the brush was good and I like the ergonomic handle. The package arrived well before the scheduled date I was told. However, the shipping was more expensive than the total of all twelve brushes. So, I can't give it five stars."
3,Not a Puzzle I Cared to Put Together,It is probably just me but I found this puzzle tedious and boring. I did not finish it.
2,DAOU is going DOWN,"Vanessa!!! What has happened to you? Your Zipless cd has got to be among the most ELITE in the industry. Then your Two to tango, although not as good as zipless, was still a good recording. THen your Plutonium Glow was just satisfactory. I think it is time to reinvent yourself. I think the problem is that your voice doesn't blend well with the tunes you provide with Plutonium Glow and John Coltrane. Where is the old Vanessa I used to love that combined her sexy, seductive, aspiring voice to her cool grooves? Your work lately has been rather uninspriational, like if you are just putting a cd out for the hell of it. Sit down with Peter and start over using your Zipless cd as your inspiration.Good luck Vanessa!"
2,Dissappointed,"""Zipless"" and ""Slow to Burn"" were good albums, not great, I like most of the songs on them and and I loved ""Make You Love."" This one though, it just seemed she and her writers didn't have any good ideas. I mean, the lyrics are good, but the songs just don't have much rhythem, they don't give me that feeling of laying back and smiling like her other ones do. It just seems like they tried to hard. Sorry Vanessa, I think you're very talented but this one just didn't do it for me."
5,GIVE ME MORE,"I picked up this cd after hearing about Vanessa from a friend, and I've become an instant fan! Her singing is VERY seductive and her music has an after hours jazz feel. I'm definitely planning to check out all her other releases, once I finally get this album out of my stereo!"
2,eh,"This book was used for a class I took and it was just ""eh"" to me. It had some interesting pages but it wasn't too interesting to read."
5,I AM ADDICTED,"Anybody But Hyacinth is wounderful. No matter which Hyacinth movie you buy you can't go wrong. I love all of the videos of ""Keeping Up Appearances."" I have all of the releases that are out. And watch it on PBS every week. I wish they would release the older shows even on TV. I am truly addicted to Hyacinth ""Buckets"" AH ""Bouquet."
2,This Book was a waste of money,"I understand why colleges make you buy this leftist stuff, but come on the book is dull boring and content well not my style or the class we attended. Why do publishers agree to publish this kind of stuff?"
5,Wonderful Discussion about Discussions,"The author explained how conclusions are generated in different discussion situations. It tells the readers that conclusions are not always the thoughts of the majority. Mass intelligence is not always trust-worthy. This book is a must for people interested in cyber psychology, management, marketing, and media."
5,Great Product!!,Very handy ball washer! Eliminates the need for carrying a wet towel with you all day...Stores neatly in your pocket too!
5,Saves my fingers from being dry in the winter,I love this product. My fingers don't dry out and crack due to winter and a wet towel. My ball gets clean and my fingers don't crack!
5,My Husband Loves It,"I married the man that is the hardest person in the world to buy for. I hit a home run with this. He loves it. Usually I get ""that's nerdy golf stuff"" from him, but not this time. He has already taken it to the golf course to give it a try. It's a winner all the way around."
5,Surprisingly Awesome,"I got tired of spitting on a towel or directly onto the golf ball to get the ball clean once it was on the green. I'm sure the spitting isn't pleasant to watch for other golfers either. I use this pocket sized product with a little bit of water inside and I can get the golf ball clean and ready for putting in just a few seconds. As long as you don't overload the product with water, you won't experience any leaks. If it does leak, turn it inside out and squeeze out the excess and it will be just fine again. I'm never going back to the towel to clean my golf balls!"
3,"No way to ""Clip to your bag"".","No way to ""Clip to your bag"". Is just a 2 piece bag with no clip or hole for a clip.Guess you could use a cloths pin???"
5,"Quality, beauty, and lead free",We also love this dinnerware. Its very colorful and each piece is hand painted. It kind of reminds me of water colors on a plate. So far it has been very durable and truly is microwave friendly (when you microwave food on a plate it warms the food and not the plate). It also meets California proposition 65 lead free standards in case you were wondering.
5,Rare quality.,"A Compeling ExplorationTom Saunders' collection is the work of a true artist.His writing leads you through a range of human interaction and emotion. In stories like THE RED TRAIN, Saunders tackles subjects that are delicate, controversial at best and with great sensitivity lays it out for the reader to advance conclusions. Without pretense or presumption he offers the reader the opportunity to explore. A true gift Brother, What Strange Place Is This? is a remarkable collection by a remarkable writer."
3,Expensive track but it works well,"As others have noted, this track is expensive but it goes together extremely easily and doesn't lose conductivity due to bad connections, even on carpet. My only other complaint is that it's loud, especially on hard surfaces. There's a loud hollow plastic-y clatter as the train travels over the track."
5,How am I the first person to review something this good?,"I'd given up on indie rock for a long time when I found this album, and I'm glad I did - its the freshest, most exciting thing I've heard in ages. ""It is the Law"" travels in a hundred fluorescent directions at once, with neon basslines bouncing off of shiny keyboards and edgy, Pixies-style guitar and male-female vocals. ""Sister in Love"" is a shimmering, driving piece of pop perfection, which, if there was any justice in this world, would be playing right now on every rock station in the U.S. This is one of those rare rock albums which gets more interesting and engaging the more you listen - buy a copy and find out for yourself."
3,just okay,It's okay but not Great for a Muddy Waters album & it was really short to be a 2 album set.
5,Szell Is Masterful In The Haydn Symphonies,"There simply is no excuse for not owning Szell's recordings of Haydn. Szell is in complete sympathy with the classicism of Haydn and Mozart, These performances are full of charm, grace, perfect sophistication and the absolute right sense of drama. The playing of the Cleveland Orchestra is exemplary as always, the sound is great too. Haydn fans, you can't be without these practically perfect records."
1,AVOID,"Avoid this product. It is the most troublesome modem I have ever run across. From the first day we had trouble. It took two hours to get the first computer connected to the cable modem. After this computer needed to be reformated (for unrelated reasons), we tried hooking it up to a second computer. Again, it took a couple hours. It said it couldn't establish a connection between the computer and the modem, despite the activity light flashing. After the original computer was reformated, the cable could not be connected to it again. We tried everything, even calling the techinicians several times. I was told that it was my ethernet port and that I needed a new one.I took the product back and got a Toshiba. The modem was hooked up no problem in 2 minutes. Avoid the Motorolla cable modem. Its absolutely horrible."
1,I would not recommend this modem,"I was having trouble accessing certain webpages and I found out that this particular modem has trouble recieving data. This is from an AT&T Technician! They recommended that I wait for a firmware upgrade or get a different modem. As a previous employee that worked with broadband internet, we always had trouble with the Motorola equipment. I would recommend either an RCA, D-Link, or Toshiba. If you are still going with a Motorola make sure it is something different than the SB 4200."
2,"Not working after 3 months, easy to use and install though","The cable modem was easy to use and install. However, after being used for about 3 months, it stops working - I can no longer use the 'standby' button, all the lights flash randomly, and the worst thing is that I can't even access to the web."
2,Poor speed,"Unlike the rest of the reviews, I did not have the same ""Blazing speed"" experience. I normally get 1.5 mps, but the SB4200 only outputed a meager 0.5mps. Not sure why. In any case, I'm returning it back to Amazon.The installation is very simple, and the modem seems to be of solid build quality. If it works for you, its definitely a winner. But, you do run the risk of returning it back if it doesn't work out."
5,Great modem!,"I was leasing my cable modem and decided to buy one. After shopping around, I bought the Motorola Surfboard SB4200 and have been very pleased. It is faster than my other modem, and the 'disconnect' button is awesome. Before I would unplug my modem but now I simply hit the button and my computer is no longer connected to the internet."
2,Two in a row returned defective,"I think you could do better as far as quality goes. Had to return my first modem two weeks after purchase, modem could not hold a connection. The second one stopped working 3 months later, the cable technicians replaced it with a different brand (I forget which) that has worked flawlessly since. My suggestion, buy a different brand or model."
3,Amazing Comcast still rents this thing to me,Upon looking at my bill the other day I realized I'm still being charged to lease this modem ($7/month). Despite I've had it for at least 7years & it's been on their end of life list for 2yrs now. It does still currently work & except for them never being able to see it when I do have an issue (maybe once a year) it works just fine. While I have no major issues I'm looking to buy my own this time and replace it
4,Not compatible with Bright House.,"The unit was delivered on time, in excellent condition, but it was not compatible with Bright House.That was my fault; I should have checked with Bright House first."
4,"Good bargain,best price in the web","i really like it the price of the modem,i m feel sorry for the seller couse the item cost allmost what he pay for the shipment,.regarding of the functionality of the modem,modem was apareantly right,but the signal from the coax never receive,so wondering what it was i swap my old modem power supply in to this one and problem solved,like i say,for this price...what else i want?,i recommend this merchant"
5,I knew it was a problem but,"I knew the screen filter on my window unit was not adequate filteration for dust, etc so I decided to give Filtrete Room Filter a try. It works great! I've noticed a difference in the dust in the house. (No central air.) It has been three weeks and the filter looks pretty gross so I guess I'll be changing it fairly frequent. Also, I was able to cut one filter to fit two units: 5K BTU + 12K BTU."
5,GREAT PRE-filter,I ordered this to increase the life of my more expensive HEPA filters. I just put this prefilter on top of the more expensive filters. When this prefilter gets dirty I just throw it away n replace.
2,... for novices only ...,"taekwondo has so many kicks, escpecially on the demo circuit ...this covers only the basic ones used in forms ... no new information, nothing that should not have already been taught by your instructor ... for the price that one must pay for this dvd, very shallow, very disappointing ... yes, i was hoping for some aerial kicks, some gee whiz moves ... dvd's do exist for them, this is definitely one of them ... unfortunatly i bought this first before i found the others ... if you cannot learn in class, get this, it does teach the basics well, if you are looking for something challenging, buy something else ..."
5,Years of use,"I bought this when I was just getting started in taekwondo so I could review at home and almost a year later, I still use it to review each kick as I learn it in class. The kicks taught here go well beyond black belt so it's something you'll be able to use for quite a few years as you progress through the belts. I like the many views of each kick and the slow motion allows me to pick up the little things that I don't catch in class. Very useful DVD and well worth the price!"
5,Outstanding Resource,I thought this DVD was excellent. I study a martial art that does not do much kicking. I received this DVD as a gift and it taught me a number of very good kicks to incorporate into my practice and sparring. The instruction was clear and the quality of the production is outstanding. I highly recommend this product.Matt
1,I didn't like this at all -- the ...,I didn't like this at all -- the flavor is so strong that it made my whole mouth and nose hurt. And it didn't seem to do a thing for my sensitive teeth.
2,Astronaut ice cream???,"Nay, nay...not so...more like the meringues you buy in the store....sweet, hard and supposed to turn into ice cream when yoursaliva revives it. Thought the idea was very unique especially since so many good things have been developed for NASAand then turned over to the private sector...run to the store and buy your favorite ice cream, fill your freezer, eat to yourhearts content because if this is the future of ice cream....well, visualize that. Let's hope cows don't become extinct....can;timagine the astronauts in space look forward to this but then who knows...afterall, they can't just run to the store, can they?"
3,It wasn't wrapped well.,"I've bought several of this item for gifts for my teenage grandsons, and others. It always goes over well. It's an unusual gift and they all say they really like it. This last order wasn't packed well, so arrived kinda crumbly inside. I'm told it still tasted great."
4,"Good, but the holes are a little big for just hatched roach nymphs","works pretty well, but i wish the holes were a little smaller. it locks onto the top very well though, i would recommend this for ANY type of reptile or somthing like that."
3,Dark European thriller,"This European thriller is a 1971 adaptation of the Alistair MacLean novel, and has most of the same elements as his better-known films, although it was less successful. The storyline involves a pair of agents who arrive in the Netherlands to break up an international drug-smuggling ring. The realization however is rather murky and dark, with bizarre plot twists involving a religious cult. As is typical in MacLean novels, the action centers on the heroic male lead, played by Swedish actor Sven-Bertil Taube. His female partner, Barbara Parkins, meets an ignominious end (implied by the film's title), which galvanizes him to avenge her. The best element is the speedboat chase through the canals of Amsterdam."
2,Not as good as rembered,"The boat chase is still good,that's about it.Sound ok picture ok,needs stereo sound to help with the chase scene. Repeated words don't count???"
4,European Shoot 'em up..!,This is the story of an agent working for the anti-drug task force investigating the shipments of heroin from Europe. Stars Sven Bertil Taube as the agent. Not as good as 007/James Bond but fairly well written and good locations. I rate it 4 stars because I like the movie. NOT an Academy Award winner but OK as a suspense/thriller about heroin smuggling and the efforts to put a stop to it.
3,Not Trinidadian Paratha.,"That's not the fault of the product, of course. I was looking for paratha or 'buss up shut,' as it's called in Trinidad. This is probably more of a Southeast Asian paratha, I think. If that's what you're looking for, then this may be fine. But I was ultimately disappointed. Alas, the search continues ..."
3,Shameless Display of Yuppie Angst,"First, I have to give this author a certain amount of credit. The book is well written and researched. But, it is essentially a memoir of a rich, spoiled girl who confused her own wedding with a presidential inauguration.For those of us who could not afford Vera Wang gowns or $10,000 engagement rigs, this author's story is pure yuppie angst. Most readers would kill to have the resources to deal with her ""stresses"" and ""problems."" The rest of us have to deal with the real world, which does not cater to our every whim."
2,Decent attempt but self-absorbed and annoying,"I bought this book after seeing the great reviews on Amazon and read it on a two-week vacation. It took me half that time to get through it, and still felt like a way-too-long movie where you become disillusioned with the main character. She had the wedding ""every girl"" wants (the 2-carat ring, the $$$ Vera Wang dress, etc.) -- at least half of each chapter is devoted to the fact -- but then she claims she would change the details. I couldn't finish the book fast enough, only because it was so incredulous. Some of her insights were amusing and informative, however. Don't buy. Check it out at the library so you can return it. I'm selling mine."
4,it grows on you,at first bite i didn't really like this. but it actually got better and better. you can really taste the peppercorn. would not hesitate to buy again.
4,an unusual Victorian novel,"Rosa Nouchette Carey is an interesting writer. She had quite a hard life looking after her family but was a prolific novelist. This novel is interesting because it is about how three sisters tackle being left penniless after the family's investments fail because their mother didn't listen to advice that they were rocky. The sisters become dressmakers, which means falling many rungs socially. However, their charm and honesty soon wins them friends and as usual in Victorian novels all comes right in the end. There are a number of different subplots, which add to the story, and all together it's an entertaining read, and also an interesting picture of the social mores and petty snobbishness of the era, which many of the characters in the novel learn to overcome. The main characters are ""not like other girls"" because they are brave and do what they feel will best help them make a living and support their mother despite what people from their social circle might think."
2,Old and dried up--you get what you pay for,"I thought I was gettiing a good deal with this because this is the same brand I use, and buy from the store for $4-$5 each. But, you do get what you paid for. This is old and dry. It can't be shaped with the fingers and softened. The only way to use it is to heat it with a hair dryer or something else hot until it is melty. Then, at best it will stay on for a few hours. I would have sent it back, but , I opened them all at once and put them all over the place because I have to use it so often, only to realize it doesn't work right :- You are better off paying the extra money. At least you will have a product that works."
4,Ha cha! I got a million of 'em!,"If you like ""The Snoz"" you'll enjoy this collection of duets taken from Durante's television (I think) show.Highlights include Bing & JImmy singing very soft, sweet and gentle and also Bob Hope and Jimmy singing about their best feature- their noses!Great fun for all ages."
3,"3/16"" x 4"" long Relton Groo-V Tip Granite, Marble and Porcelain Multi-Purpose Drill Bit",Good product but not as durable as i had expected. It makes a great replacement for the more expensive bits when in a jam.
5,Experience the character's love of beauty.,"This is a novel about a woman in modern Japan. In an ingenious plot device, the woman, as a favor to a friend, converses with the friend's depressed and shy father, using a screen to separate them visually, kind of like a psychiatrist's couch. This turns into something of a career, but also echoes the writings of a famous medieval Japanese woman author, at a time when noblewomen led secluded lives. The love of beauty unites the two women, and is an important element in both historic periods, however unsatisfactory other aspects of the periods are. Now Blensdorf had lived in Japan only 2 years when she wrote this book, and I cannot vouch for the accuracy of some of her commentaries on modern Japanese life; certainly, she isn't very artful or subtle in conveying them. Nor is Sei Shonagon's general plot line very artful or subtle. What Blensdorf does remarkably well is to make the reader experience the woman's love of beauty, and its powers of sustenance."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I enjoyed this book immensely. The author's personal experience of the war in Vietnam is not just a war story. It unfolds an appreciation of the people of Vietnam under the extraordinary pressures of the war and also provides an amazing perspective on the Vietnam war as a situation which could elicit, for a few Americans, a spiritual and moral transformation.After reading it I bought several copies to share with friends. I recommend it highly!"
3,Exotic and poetical,"I have picked out this book at my local library's summer booksale. I realy liked the title. I love silk and just wearing it brings back the memories of the wonderful time I have pent in Southeast Asia. I was curious to find out the author's reasons for choosing the title. It was delight to find out that this talented writer is both scientist and a poet, cosmopolitan in cast of characaters she introduces in her stories - as well as wonderful places around the world used for staging some of her stories. Her characters are complex and vulnerable. Some of the stories are connected, so in some ways the book feels like a sort of novella, too. After reading it I had a feeling that this book is strongly personal for Ms. Mazur and that it has its strength in the possibility of being semi-autobiography mixed with dash of fiction."
2,VERY BASIC ... FOR TWO TO THREE YEAR OLDS,Our daughter is a huge fan of the Dora the Explorer televisionshow. She turns four this month. This game is very basic andway too easy for her. I would only recommend this game for children between two and three years old.
1,The play mat is awful!,"I was disapointed with this toy - the play mat is a folded up piece of plastic and never lays flat enough to play on. I actually tried to iron the creases out and that still did not work very well. Once you get the creases out, then there is no way to store the play mat because if you fold it, then you have to deal with the creases and bumps again."
1,Good concept but poor materials,"This game is cute, and my daughter enjoyed playing, but the huge oversized game board will not lie flat, so I had to find eight small heavy weights to hold it down. The rules are vague on numerous points, so we made up our own. The cardboard characters quickly became frayed on the edges so that they needed to be taped to fit into the bases. My daughter loved this game because of the characters and concept, but it was a big struggle to use."
2,Needs new board.,"I agree with the other reviews complaining about the board. I was able to flatten it out after putting a towel over it and ironing it for about 20 minutes, but now I have no way to store it. The game is somewhat ambiguous also, not enough direction meaning there are too many options."
3,Game board disappointment,"This would be an enjoyable game if the gameboard was not a flimsy piece of glossy paper. It doesn't lay down flat and we have to use books to hold the edges down. Even with that, there are several bumps on the ""board"" and the player markers won't stand up as a result. Don't buy this until they change the board."
1,"Too Big, too clumsy",My daughters 2.5 and 4 were disappointed when the huge mat (that takes up a whole table) would not open fully. The creases made hills and the pawns could not stand upright. My girls had to reach over the matt and would knock the other players over. It got REALLY frustrating FAST. The colorforms also didn't stick very well to the characters.
2,Cute but...major problem!,"My almost 4 year old daughter always wants to play this game, because the idea and concept is cute, AND she loves Dora! She got it as a gift last Christmas, and we have maybe played it 3x! BECAUSE her mommy (ME) does not want to play this game. The plastic mat/game board is a nightmare. I cannot get this mat to lay flat enough to play the game decently. I have ironed it even, and the creases will only come out temporarily. But who the heck wants to iron a game board before each play? NOT ME! I have rolled it up to avoid creases, and it won't fit in the box. This game is a cute idea, and all, but don't waste your money, on this one. They need to come up with a better board before this game will be a good one!"
2,Dora the explorer game,"This game was a great idea, but the pieces were poorly constructed. Like most of the previous reviewers, I could not get the characters to stand up on the crinkly game board. Another problem is that the spinner will not spin for one complete revolution. The game ends up being frustrating."
1,Dora The Explorer Big Easy Colorforms Game,"We purchased the Big Easy Game (Dora the Explorer) for our 3 1/2 year old son.The box advertises that it's for Ages 3 and up and NO READING REQUIRED.This game is poorly designed and a complete waste of money. My 3 1/2 year old within 5 minutes ask us to return the game to Target because It was ""YUKEY"".The 10 sq ft giant floor mat won't lay flat - therefore the cardboard figures won't stand up. A cardboard game board would have been a lot better.The stickers won't stay on the figures. The rules of the game are not easy to understand.We were very disappointed in this product."
3,"Fun game, but needs a new board.......","My daughter received this for her 4th birthday, she loves playing it but the board is not suitable for this game at all - its a big plastic sheet that you cannot remove the bumps from! Makes it a challenge to play but can be done, wait for a sale on this one."
4,ONE OF THE BEST HOUSE CD's OUT THERE,"This is one of the best house CD's on the market today, it has a lot of variety and hard beats. If you like House, Breakz, Funk, then you'll love this cd. I listen to it almost every day!!!"
5,MY THOUGHTS ON BAD BOY BILL,"I THINK BAD BOY BILL IS ONE OF DA BEST D.J""S I HAVE EVER HEARD I WILL GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM THIS MONTH..HIM AND HUMPTY VISON MAKE A HELL OF A TEAM.THEY KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE PARTY HYPE ON ON EDGE..BAD BOY BILL DOSENT KNOW THE WORD SLOW..LISTENING TO HIM IS WHAT MADE ME RESPECT MUSIC IN ALL CATEGORIES IT MAKES ME LISTEN TO THA BEAT OF THA MUSIC AND NOT JUST THA WORD""s DRAMA"
2,Bad Boy presents Bad Mix Volume 4,"Ok, I actually like Bad Boy Bill. His beats are really uptempo and get you moving, and some of his tracks are top notch. Bangin' in London is an excellent album, but this is one of his releases that killed me. I bought this CD the second I heard ""Uptown"" which still remains one of the only good tracks on this album. The CD was bumpin' for the first few times I heard it, but soon enough I was reluctant to ever put it in again. It slowly gave me headaches, and the CD far from impressed my friends, it made most people queasy to be in the same room as it.Bad Boy Bill spins pretty well live, and is not a bad dj in my opinion, but this CD is like a pop radio station, the sh!# gets played out...quick."
5,House that keeps you grovin',"Bad Boy Bill has created an awesome set here, the tracks are perfect and the beats are grovin'. The disc starts out with an explosive sampling of such killer tracks as BT's ""Beliver"" mixed with some cool samples and quickly jumps into the mix, no slow build up just, ""BAM"" there it is!The one thing I really like about this mix is that it doesnt get boring, the set changes so quickly you don't know what hit you, one minute your groving to ""that Zipper Track"" and the next, your transported into ""Cold Phused"".An all around great mix compilation, the tracks are fresh, interesting, and most of all groveable. A must for anyone: Raver, producer, DJ, etc. Enjoy!"
3,Bad Boy Bill at his best,"This is a good CD mixed by a lousy DJ. The anthem house tracks selected get old quickly, but I like the way several tracks are used during a single build on this CD. It has no flavor of Chicago and it is generic. It reminds me of a cheap plastic toy that's extremely fun for a day or two, but then gets forgotten. I recomend borrowing a friend's copy of this because it's a good listen 4 or 5 times, but that's about it. I did see Bad Boy Bill live, just to give him a chance to impress me. He failed. He simply cannot mix tracks as quickly as he does on this CD anywhere outside the studio. For real house music look in the direction of DJ Dan or Donald Glaude."
3,I Expected Better,I expected better from him. I bought this cd thinking that it would be great but it isnt. It isnt great at all. I am very disappointed in this cd.
2,not what i expected,"i still have 3 of the pots that the herbs are doing good. I have used some of the basil and thyme for dressings. I was disappointed that there were no holes in the pots, but it may not have been necessary for clay pots to have holes since they are porous, just not what I am used to. Also, the soil reminded me wet saw dust and not soil at all. I was not sure how much to water them and I overwatered one of them to where the water was standing on the top and went to tip it over slightly to drain the water off and the whole thing came out ... I just used some of my potting soil in it and put some more seeds in to grow and they never did grow - it was the cilantro. The chives never did come up. There was supposed to be enough seeds for a couple of plantings, but that is not what I received. It is a really sturdy stand and looks pretty on the counter in the kitchen. I would not recommend it."
3,Very average,"This is okay for the price you could probably just buy the components separately for about the same price. The pots have no drainage, and the rack always leave 2 of the pots without adequate sunlight unless you have a spot with exceptional sunlight coverage. Good for people who dont know much but you could easily buy something better at a gardening story for about the same price."
3,Not much growth,I purchased this herb set for my mother-in-law's birthday and she informed me that she did not have much luck with some of the herbs growing. She said the presentation of the herbs on the accompanying stand adds a nice touch to one's counter space. Maybe more light was needed.
1,Not worth the cost,"This product costs way too much for what you get. Cheap plastic holders and inexpensive pots. The soil was compacted into discs. You had to add water and break it apart with a fork. It took time and was like tar balls yet I ended up with not enough soil. One seed packet seemed not to have any seeds in it. It would have cost pennies to include some plastic flags with herb names to stick in the pots so you could identify what is orowing. I just put it out and will wait 10-15 days to see what happens,,,very disappointed in quality and value.UPDATE: 2 herbs never grew..I asked for more seeds and was told I would get a refund which I was very happy about. I went to home depot and bpought growing herbs and sove cheap pots and soil...They are thriving on my Lanai"
2,Bad idea,The plants withered after month. Some of the seeds rotted because tere were no holes. Not a good purchase.
1,2 bad! =(,The book waz pretty boring 4 an Aerosmith fan! The book seems 2 focus on the negative! Well if u want a great read on Aerosmith then get WALK THIS WAY - an autobiography written by the legends themselves! What It Takes doesn't seem 2 b written by true Aerosmith fans. If u r a true Aerosmith fan then I recomend Walk This Way b'cause it has a unique format and is well written! luv- an Aerosmith fan
1,Unusually biased...,"The summary says it all. I don't know what the authors intended to achieve, but they managed to end up slagging off Steven Tyler and saying that everything that went wrong with Aerosmith was his fault. WRONG ! Read ""Walk This Way: The Official Autobiography of Aeromsith"" if you want the truth- keep this one for when you want to mindlessly hate out on Steven Tyler. I mean let's face it, Joe Perry didn't help things... plus it was the whole thing that was messed up: the band, the management, the producers, the wives... need I go on ?"
1,WHAT THEVE GOT TO BE CRAZY READ WALK THIS WAY,they blamed everything on steven and its not right i think you should have took more time and got new info too. it sucked sorry to say that but i also have walk this way and it has hard core details real good
3,"I didn't like the taste at first, but ...","I didn't like the taste at first, but I got used to it after a few days. I saw only a slight color difference in my teeth, but then you have to consider the fact that it's been only two weeks. Before recommending it to anyone, I'd need more time to see results and I'd switch to another flavor."
2,I'm sorry to say that I didn't find ...,"I'm sorry to say that I didn't find any noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. The toothpaste tasted good and felt like it was really polishing my teeth, but I saw no real difference in the color. Perhaps after a longer trial period I'll see whiter teeth, but if you're looking for a quick fix, this isn't it."
3,I used the Rembrandt Low Abrasion Toothpaste for ...,"I used the Rembrandt Low Abrasion Toothpaste for more than a week, and found that my teeth felt clean. However, it didn't remove my stubborn stains. My unstained teeth appeared whiter, though. The stubborn stains will probably require a trip to the dentist. I believe the Rembrandt toothpaste would be ideal for maintaining your teeth's whiteness after having them professionally polished and for that, I can recommend it."
3,I went into this thinking the Rembrandt toothpaste ...,"I went into this thinking the Rembrandt toothpaste might not taste that great, but I found that it had a pleasing taste. I don't know if after seven days I can judge the whitening aspects of this product (which is the primary reason I would buy it). I felt like my teeth looked better, but not significantly different. I'd buy this product and give it a longer test for sure."
3,My review of the Rembrandt Low Abrasion Whitening ...,"My review of the Rembrandt Low Abrasion Whitening Toothpaste is only marginal. First, the texture of the toothpaste was so dry that many an application fell off my toothbrush because it was too dry to stick to it (which is a pet peeve of mine, by the way). Second, I just didn't get the results from this toothpaste that I've gotten from others. I'm a coffee drinker, so I like to use whitening toothpaste every now and again. Finally, it costs too much. I've tried other lower-cost whitening toothpastes and I've seen better results. So, no, I wouldn't recommend this product to others or use it again myself."
3,"Nice, but not if you have 20Gb","This is a great product which not only allows you to use a Mac-version iPod on a PC, but its very friendly Explorer-like interface is great for Windows-version iPods as well. I've been using XPlay since its beta versions, and its interface is simply brilliant.One MAJOR caveat: it is EXTREMELY S-L-O-W with the 20Gb iPod. IF YOU HAVE A 20GB IPOD, DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Check ... & wait until an update is released to fix this MAJOR speed problem. Slow = many minutes instead of seconds to sync tracks. If you have a 10 or 5Gb model, XPlay is highly recommended, however. If you have a 20Gb, check out ephpod instead."
5,Pc Heaven,... for X-mas I had gotten a I pod the problume being I had pc and A mac and as I was downloading all my songs to the PC witch was my mistake and know i can transfer my tunes to MY Ipod from A PC
4,Fine Product but would prefer separate batteries,"This is a fine replacement for the original unit that has expired after five years of service. Replacement was quite easy with no need to turn the system off. It would be much better if APC offerred replacement batteries instead of a full cartridge. Besides the extra cost, the disosal of a cartridge was tricky since the recycling center accepts only bare batteries, thus I had to disassemble the unit. There are batteries offerred by other vendors but I would prefer original APC since this would imply matching the batteries and quality control."
1,Don't waste your time,"The chutzpah these guys have. This book has nothing whatsoever to do with interactive TV. It's a technical overview of Digital TV (all the boring technical detail about standards, compression etc that is freely available on the web). They don't even mention a word about middleware providers(Open TV, Liberate etc); they don't deal at all with the business/marketing or media issues related to ITV. If u are looking fo information about interactive TV, look elsewhere. I feel ripped off and (angry)."
4,A Useful Overview of Interactive TV,"This book covers the technical basics upon which interactive TV is built. It is not a business-oriented look at interactive services, which are still very fluid. What it does cover, quite well, is the fundamental technologies that make interactive TV work. Considerable detail is provided on digital television, the real enabler of this technology, and the standards being developed to make it all work. I found the book a good primer on the technologies involved."
3,"Fast Read, Slow Write","Like the title said, it's read speed meets the usb 2.0 spec. But the write speed is as slow as usb 1.1 spec."
1,Item does not match picture,"The item does not match the picture. Instead, the item is a boxy device with an octagonal shaped plastic outer structure that is smoky ink colored. Not nearly as cool looking as the one in the picture. This one goes back."
1,Viking Flash Drive,"I am very disappouinted in your offering.The item which arrived did not look anything like what was depjicted in the ad.You really should make sure the items match.Amazon.com should be above any inference of ""bait and switch"".Thanks.Shang Lew"
2,Bujold's weakest book to date still contains highlights,"Ethan of Athos contains some of the neatest explanations for a space station's operations. The plot has a few interesting twists, but the story lacks a strong character. Bujold's strength remains in her character development, and this book focuses on the plot. Komarr contains much of the same mystery elements as Ethan of Athos, but is much better written."
2,Somewhat dissappointing,"This one had a lot of potential... the premise of Athos had a lot of explorable possibilities, and I was hungry for more of Elli Quinn, but alas, Bujold squandered much of this potential on cheap humor and an outrageous plot. Practically no character development except for Ethan himself. If you're a die-hard fan of the series, I'd recommend it, but it could be easily skipped."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Manhome loses some girl bits.A scientists investigates the disappearance of some reproductive material from the titular planet, one which is completely populated by males. In the course of his investigations he meets a woman from that Vorkosigan related bunch, the Dendarii Free Mercenaries. Being a spook of sorts, she is rather useful, especially when kidnapping and dodgy bounty hunters is involved."
2,Yucky Sci-Fi Candy,"Science Fiction fluff. I found the idea of a planet entirely populated with men, intriguing. But McMaster Bujold copped out on this one. Not an ounce of depth. Fluffy characterization, silly plot. A total waste of time. Disappointing because I expected a little more from the author. This book was short, which is the best thing I can say about it. Not a hard read, but not a good one either. A book to read when you don't want to think."
4,"A Fun, Light-hearted Romp","This is a fun romp through a space station through the eyes of a man who has never seen a woman and has been raised to believe that they are the ultimate evil. Unfortunately for him, he's also pretty open-minded and a genuinely nice guy. Plus, one woman in particular (Quinn) keeps saving his life from the machinations of the bad guys and eventually it seems like bad form to run away from her every time he does so. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
3,An Enjoyable Book,"This was an enjoyable book to read. It's nowhere near as deep as Bujold's other books, but it was still fun. I think the people here who rated the book very low are going a bit overboard in comparing it to the rest of her works. Standing on it's own, it's worth reading. It's just that in comparison to the rest of the Vorkosigan books (i.e., the one's with Miles in them), this book suffers. But, if you'd like to fill in a few hours with some light reading, go ahead and try this one."
4,"Great read, but depressing and frustrating!","Things go to hell with this dream boat right from the beginning, then get worse.This continues throughout the entire book. Problems that we all encounter in our lives seem minuscule to what takes place to this author.I place the blame on the author for the series of disasters that continue in this account from the beginning to end. He seems to be an accomplished sailor, but poor manager/director.Book is written very well and I like the author's style. Day to day details of the sailing trips are kept to a minimum. I am not sure if this is good or bad.The book was hard to put down. Money well spent."
3,This ass deserved it,"The read is fun, mostly because it's nice to see a pompous little jerk get what's coming to him. You can't help but be annoyed by Vann's unfounded know-it-all attitude, how he always saved the situation because everyone else was just panicking, for example. He hires morons and people who will take advantage of him but he never puts the blame on himself. This guy is a rube and jerk and has no respect for people. It's no wonder he gets ripped off at every turn. Justin Bieber at sea."
2,Everything is everyone's fault but mine.,"Read the book. Whatever merits the survival story had were quickly overshadowed by the blamefest that the author embarked upon. The Moroccans made a lousy boat. Had a lousy secretary. The Germans and all the port people were lousy. The insurance was lousy. The District Attorney was lousy. Need I go on? However if you can get past these never-ending blame games, David Vann has a good story, and writes artfully."
5,"David Vann's ""A Mile Down""","Why do men go down to the sea in ships? The power of the ocean has long compelled men to go, hearing in the windy sea a siren offering the secrets of fame, sustenance, fortune, romance. Author David Vann went down to the sea to forge a career, to free himself forever from ""the endless treadmill of middle-class labor."" To accomplish his dream, Vann commissioned a sleek sailing ship in Turkey and sold educational charters to ancient ports in the Mediterranean Sea. He then embarked on a voyage so riddled with misfortune and danger it could only exist in another man's nightmares -- his ship is hopelessly flawed. But when his boat sinks, ""A Mile Down"" in the Caribbean, David Vann finds the key to a mystery that has haunted him for many years. ""A Mile Down"" is more than an adventure story; it is a memoir of discovery and reconciliation written to inspire even confirmed landlubbers. If you read only one book this summer, make that one book ""A Mile Down."""
3,A lot of whining!,"I don't know, guys. I read the hype for this book, bought it, and dove in with great expectations. Overall, it is well written but the author's agenda - to blame everyone and anyone but himself for mistake after horrific mistake - overshadowed any merit to the story. It felt a bit like a deposition written in hopes that his former creditors might read it and exonerate him. I found it hard to feel badly for someone who used and abused other peoples' trust and money so that he wouldn't have to get a real job. Poor Mr. Vann!"
3,In over his head from the start.,"David Vann had me from the first page with his style of writing. As time wore on and his naivete with boat builders in Turkey set him up for future disaster I wanted to grab him by the collar and shout, ""Get a grip here! This is your life you are fooling around with."" But he plows on pushing to make deadlines he cannot make and rushing off to sea with a shoddy boat that nearly kills him. The disasters in this book are created by David and I got exasperated with his lack of planning. I have lived in Asia and there is a mentality there expressed in the Hindi word: chalega, i.e. it'll work. When you just know it won't work. His carelessness creates a good story but it does not make me want to identify with him. And what's up with no pictures of the boat. Even a line drawing would have made the book a lot better."
1,Thumbs down,"This is one of the most boring EC books I have ever read. The premise sounded so promising. I was very disappointed in this offering by Ms. Ladd. There was not connection with the characters and the sex scenes, and that's all they were, were not romantic AT all."
2,Pass this one by!!!,"This LSAT Prep book is boring!!! If you want a general overview of the LSAT and a brief overview of some techniques, then maybe this would help you a little bit. The strategies they recommend are too time-consuming for me. Beware, this book didn't help me that much, if any, and the strategies are a little weird. I'd recommend buying PrepTests from LSAC and practicing with real tests rather than the ones provided here. There are plenty of better prep books than this one."
1,By no means should you buy this book,"I wasted one whole week on this book (and that was four weeks before the LSAT) before I realized it was doing nothing for me. The chapters on the arguments section are worthless--the simulated LSAT questions in this book are much more difficult than the real ones, which serves only to confuse and discourage you. The chapter on the games section will help you with the most simple games, which account for one or two out of four games on the real test. Don't make the same mistake I did (I wish I had read some reader reviews before buying the book). In my opinon, the only LSAT prep books worth buying are the two PowerScore bibles. Plus, of course all the real LSATs you have time for. After working through the Princeton book, I was scoring 10 of 24 on the games. After practicing hard with the PowerScore Games Bible, I scored 22/24."
2,So So for Colors and Shapes,It's a rather hum drum story based around trying to teach shapes and colors to kids. Neither original in story or in illustration. Plus some of the shapes or colors are either ambiguous or mislabeled.
4,Murder Once Removed,I'm a big fan of Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible) and thought I'd purchase this movie primarily because she was in it. It was pretty good for the price but I was not overly impressed with it...
3,Weird mishmash with a few gems,"Coffee-table size book with a wide mishmash selection of art, the first half being a mix of 17th-19th century and Chinese and Japanese images, the second half being western 20th century art. The 20th century modern stuff is mostly nightmarish and uninteresting to me, but then I'm biased.. Lots of famous names in this book, including Picasso and Dali. If you're into those guys you might eat this up. To me, perhaps the best images in the book are some drawings by Thomas Rowlandson, the worst being some stuff from the 60s and 70s near the end. Obviously the eds. were heavily influenced by the current trends in art wankery (no pun intended!)"
1,Not for 2005 model,"It only fits model prior to 2005. It has a Denso box, but the filter is made in China. Will you pay $25 for that?"
2,Its Use Doesn't Seem to Have Mended My Nails,"Orly Nail Defense Protein-Enriched Strengthener claims that its formula will condition and nourish nails weakened by artificial products. Orly, the makers, seem to specialize in nail products; they state that this popularly-priced product which is enriched with a double dose of plant-derived protein and gelatin will bond nail layers together and seal the free edge of the nail to prevent peeling and splitting. I've been using this conditioner for a while now, on manicured and bare nails. It does give a certain amount of sheen to bare nails, which makes them look a little better, but otherwise, my nails are now very weak, cracking, splitting and peeling a great deal. This product doesn't seem to have mended them. I won't buy it again."
5,Rewind - just like the first time,"My husband had this album on 8-track tape when I married him in 1971. We transferred it to cassette and now have bought it on DVD. The sound is great and we are rockin' out into our 60's from the 60's. It's an amazing album, part of our lives for the past 40 years and still fresh. This sounds like Johnny Rivers - the first time. It was always his best album.Sally"
1,Rewind Realization,I was looking forward to all these great songs of Johnny Rivers on one CD! I was amazed and dissapointed at the poor quality. I brought out the Johnny Rivers Anothology CD's I purchased a few years ago to compare . There is no comparison in the quality of the same songs. It is a shame this studio is doing such a disservice to such a great artist. Amazon needs to re-consider using them as a vendor.
3,A good listen,"When Jimmy Webb was riding high, Johnny Rivers took advantage of covering his songs and did a good job. As I recently listened to this cd, particularly on the ""Rewind"" album, it dawned on me how similar the arrangements were on most of these songs. Lush strings,horns, and piccolo etc. with Johnny's voice out front.If you listen to these songs one after the other the sameness kind of gets to you. However, each one on its own merits still sounds great. I made my own cd and mixed his songs with other artists so the cuts sound fresher. Just a suggestion."
2,"Interesting, but baseless premise","While I found the book interesting and a decent read for pleasure, I was made aware that the document cited as the proof of the premise has possibly been forged and is unreliable and incorrect at least. The original copy of the document clearly does not show the same entry as the one cited and used for the book. I have been made aware of this fact by serveral people and I personally know a researcher that has seen the original document and is currently writing an article that will be published in the next edition of Ripper Notes magazine. Thank You!"
1,Fraud,"With the seeming explosion of literary frauds, one more example is hardly worth an eye-blink it seems. While this case will never be discussed on Oprah, it is worthy of note to those with a passing interest for truth in research.In the publication wars, ethics have fallen by the wayside. Researchers commit fraud on both the large and small scale. From multi-million dollar stem cell research fraud, to the hoards of students who have no qualms about buying entire papers and submitting them as their own, or just peppering their papers with minor bits of fraudelent or plagiarized data.The most important piece of evidentiary data in the book is forged. There is no question about that. The picture that is in this book does not match the picture that is on record in the library archives from which it was taken. Neither the authors, nor the publishers are willing to go on record and explain how such a ""mistake"" could have occurred. Yet another sad example of a growing trend in the ""non-fiction"" field."
1,No Proof,I've read about 20 or so books on Jack the Ripper and this book has absolutely no proof what so ever that John Williams is Jack. It is full of absolutely nothing at all but supposition. Not one shred of real evidence is presented.
2,I don't think so...,"In this latest theory of Ripper lore the authors take us on a journey filled with more consiparcy theories and an endless series of unanswered questions.The author is a descendant of John Williams (our 'supposed' subject). Most of his conjecture is based on a note written in 1888 which places the suspect (a doctor) in the Whitchapel area.It's a lean theory at best and presents no real hard evidence. This book is filled with more, could have's, might have's, and probable implausibities that regardless of how hard the authors try - it's impossible to weave these extremely loose threads together.And all in the name of medical research? I don't think so. Serial killers don't do research and are not motivated by *positive* goals to better mankind! The lack of real research into the world of the Ripper is clearly evident. It's almost worth the read so you can shake your head at the drivel."
2,vulgar,"I am a big fan of Miss Manners, and I think it's for that reason I found this novel so distressing. It's full of unpleasant people doing unpleasant things to each other. There's lots of explicit, tawdry sex, and all the characters are repulsive and loathsome. I found myself wishing it would transform into a Shakespearean tragedy where everybody kills each other violently in the end--but no such luck.I give it two stars rather than one because the writing is competent, although the story is deliberately and unceasingly vulgar. Ms. Martin is a talented craftsman and I can only assume that she did what she set out to do with this book. I only wonder why she set her aspirations so low."
4,I used Sensodyne Toothpaste twice a day for ...,"I used Sensodyne Toothpaste twice a day for approximately one week. I found some decrease (especially in the last two days) in the sensitivity of my teeth to cold and hot liquids and solids (approximately 75% improvement). The flavor is minty, but not too minty. The consistency and texture of the product takes a little while to adjust to, as it didn't leave my mouth (even with multiple rinsings) feeling mouthwash-clean. It's a toothpaste and thus has a pasty quality. Overall, I would buy it again if improvement continues. This toothpaste has had the indirect effect of making me more conscious of the process and duration of my toothbrushing! I would recommend this product to individuals experiencing tooth sensitivity."
3,Sensodyne toothpaste worked adequately to numb tooth sensitivity. ...,"Sensodyne toothpaste worked adequately to numb tooth sensitivity. I didn't notice a drastic improvement. It has a good taste and cleans well, although obviously it's not as good with plaque or whitening as other products that're specifically designed for that purpose. I'm not sure it's worth the price, either."
3,I heard a lot of great things about ...,"I heard a lot of great things about Sensodyne Toothpaste before I used it. I wasn't able to test it long enough to feel its effects, but I liked the minty taste. I know it's recommended by dentists, and I probably would have had to use it longer to feel the effects. I noticed that when I used it with a Sonicare electric toothbrush, the paste did not foam as well as when I used a regular toothbrush."
4,whoo!,Just every once in a while ya gotta read a girlie chick flick novel about vikings and fair maidens--ya know?
4,Vikings,"Fun, fun, funI love Sandra HillShe makes me laugh and that is so importantFun, luaghter and love"
4,"This toothpaste had a good flavor, wasn't gritty ...","This toothpaste had a good flavor, wasn't gritty tasting, and seemed to work just fine! It left my teeth feeling smooth and clean, and that effect lasted pretty much all day. It also seemed to whiten my teeth up a bit, which is a definite plus! I'll continue to use this brand because I'm definitely happy with the end results!"
3,I thought the Gleem worked fine. It said ...,"I thought the Gleem worked fine. It said it would whiten my teeth. However, I didn't see a difference in the week I used it. My husband said he didn't like the taste. I didn't mind the taste. It tasted like normal toothpaste. It seemed not as thick as other toothpastes we've used. I'll continue to use the product until it's all gone. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone, because I didn't see any distinct advantages or disadvantages to other toothpastes."
5,reliable product,I have been using this tooth paste for years I can't get it in the stores anymore haven't had a cavity since I started using this years ago bottom line is it works!
3,I haven't used Gleem in many years and ...,"I haven't used Gleem in many years and was anxious to try this product. I particularly liked the flavor -- not too strong and it has a fresh, minty flavor. After brushing, my teeth felt clean and fresh. I also like that the toothpaste is an anti-cavity type. I'd recommend this product to anyone."
3,The toothpaste felt very smooth in my mouth. ...,The toothpaste felt very smooth in my mouth. It had a great fresh taste. I didn't like the packaging. It was very boring and didn't catch my eye. It isn't very different than other toothpastes. I felt that it cleaned the same and it kept my breath fresh. I might buy this when I buy toothpaste next. It all depends on the price.
2,What happened?!,"The first three Cirque books were awesome! The series started out spectacular. It should have had that quality, and be great from beginning to end.So what happened????Darren Shans writing style and voice seem to have changed. It's been eight years, now, and Darren and Mr. Crepsley are off to vampire mountain. And, um, that's about it. Call me ignorant, but that's all I could see. Some parts on the way there were great, but the rest went way downhill. To me, the rest of the book compiled of Mr. Crepsley's friends, and how Vampire Mountain works. A plot only comes near the end, with a cliffhanger. I definately did not enjoy this as much as I did with Tunnels of Blood. I liked seeing Darren interact with the ""normal"" world and Evra Von. Things change, but something about this book doesnt seem right. I do hope things shape up soon."
3,vimpire mountain,i give this book 3 becaue itsbored and only thing that they talk about is that how do they get there.its about darren sean who goes to the vimpire mountain and he takes 2 little man and a wolf. and some part of the book is exciting because like how the wolf tried to save sean from danger andmostly its boring because it toook half of the book to just to get there
1,A half-vampire and a half-book,"I have enjoyed this series so far, but this book was incomplete. The first three books were complete self-contained stories. This book setup the story, but then came to a cliffhanger ending. You need to buy the next book to read the complete story. Essentially, I had to pay full price for a half-book."
4,You have got to be kidding me!,"I absolutely LOVED the book but the ending was horrible! A cliff-hanger? Seriously? You might as well TELL all your fans to stop reading your books! By the time I get the next one, I'll have read another series!But even though the ending stinks, I would still read the next one."
4,A Very Well Written Love Song,"As a fan of the band, I've enjoyed this song for a while now. The version found on this single, can also be found on the X-Files soundtrack. There is also a variation of it on ""The Colour and the Shape"". This version is somewhat more refined. The sound is cleaned up, the vocals hit better, and there is a drum beat. In addition the guitar is no longer acoustic as it is on the album. Slightly less honest than the original, it still brings a tear to my eye and can be appreciated on a different level. Would've gotten 5 stars if they had included another FF track instead of Ween's ""Beacon Light"", whose driving beat clashes with the tone and melody of ""Walking After You""."
2,Overpowering fragrance,"I bought this thinking it would be good for everyday application for my little one's dry skin. The texture is very nice but the fragrance is so strong that after the second application, I decided to give it away. How can companies make such products and recommend for babies? Do they even think before they put it in the market?"
4,"wonderful, refreshing smell",This product is a wonderful moisturizer for my toddler's skin. Glides on easily and is not excessively greasey.
3,Pulsar Watch Band a Challenge,"The Pulsar watch, while attractive, has a watch band that is vastly oversized and requires a special pin press to remove any extra links. I wound up paying a jeweler $9 to adjust. The manual is a generic one that does not seem have a section that applies to the actual watch. I found the watch bulkier than I had expected, but similar to other watches in that genre."
2,Great Player. But a poor instructional DVD.,"This DVD goes through some pretty awesome solos, but unless your a fairly advanced player you'll find it difficult to understand. The PDF file that comes with it is useless just shows a few scales. No notation or tabulature is in included for the solos. I had high hopes to learn some of Elliots solos with this DVD. Again, I have nothing but the highest admiration for Elliot. But a useless DVD for the novice."
1,Very disappointing,"He demonstrates very few songs, very few solos. I was expecting him to show how to play solos to pretty much all the cars songs, but there are maybe 6, total, and only one that was a big hit (Best Friend's Girl). Even there, he shows the solo, but doesn't show how to play the rockabilly rhythm figure.I would avoid this DVD at all costs. It was lazily done. Not nearly enough effort put into it. If they'd given half a damn, they could have shown how to play 30 or 40 solos. They really half-assed this thing. Avoid."
5,The Bat is Back in Black!!!,"I got this game for my birthday, and I started plaqying it with my new Gameboy Advance. I have to tell you, I thought it was better than any hand-held game ever created! You play as Batman in the side-scroller stages, but in some levels, you are Batgirl and Robin in the Batwing, Robin (in some of the Mr. Freeze levels), and Batman in the Batmobile. If you are a mom or dad who has a child who likes Batman, definately get him/her this game!"
3,could be a lot better,"I've played quite a few Batman video games in the past, but this one doesnt have as much fighting action as all the others. There is a lot of puzzle solving and batmobile driving levels, and the fighting levels are kind of cheesy. It has some cool action here and there with the main bosses and the batmobile levels, but the graphics and the fun could be more enjoyable. The music is kind of cool like the movie music danny elfman did the score for."
1,Merle Haggard doing covers of...Merle Haggard?,"As the other reviewer said, these are all new versions of classic songs. To me it came across as Merle Haggard doing covers of his own material. Packaging very misleading. AVOID!!!"
1,Remakes,"A few years ago, Merle Haggard sat down and remade almost all of his biggest hits in a mamoth recording session. Now all of these songs are spreading around to every cheap record company who repackages them.Be careful, everything here is remakes.Dont let the ""orginal recordings remastered"" label fool you."
2,Didn't Add Much to our Needs,Not very helpful for our needs. REalized we were looking for to much for first time purchase of a piano.
4,love scare dem with elephantman,"yes i every body well,i love this album specialy for the last riddim , the scare dem is more than wonderbeautyful excuse my english(i'm french) big respect every body"
4,Good overall value,Good beginner piano book. I like that it has a CD so that you can listen to how the songs should sound. I purchased Book 1 for my son and he really enjoyed playing the CD in the car and listening to the songs he was learning.
3,might not consider buying this book,"Not enough details were explained this book. If you just want a resource for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, this is a good reference book. Unfortunately, it is too wordy and begins to bore onself after a while. There must be better books concerning those three weapons systems available."
1,games like this give the ps2 a bad name....,"this is an AWFUL game! the graphics are on the level of a Super Nintendo! there is NO exploring, and if I ever hear that over-grown monkey say Tarzan Help! again I'll scream! Tarzan is also very hard to control...you end up just doing the same tasks over and over and you never know where you are because the graphics just repeat (like that matters considering they don't let you go anywhere) I wouldn't even RENT this game it's not worth the 6 bucks."
4,Good game for younger kids,"My son loves this game! Sometimes it has been hard, as a parent, to find a game for a 7 year old that is not filled with loads of violence. It can be repetitive, but for someone my sons age it still presents a challenge for him."
4,Beverly Hills Detective,"This book is very easy to read. The account flows well and naturally. The police/crime events depicted are real life. They are amusing,aggravating, rewarding, sometimes disappointing.The author approaches his subject directly, and is knowledgeable of the actions described. The interface with, and knowledge of, certain TV and Movie celebrities, is a plus. This is a good book."
2,Text and color rendition inferior to Apple,"The display is large and bright; it's easy to set up and configure. However, I found the text quality blurred as compared with my Apple Cinema Display, which needs to be replaced. Also, color rendition is inferior to that of the Apple.I was induced into buying the Acer by the online reviews, which are clearly positive. I must respectfully disagree with these assessments.Also, I am disappointed in Amazon's requiring that its customers abide by the return policies of Amazon's commercial partners. Having purchased hundreds of items from Amazon and occasionally returning several, I was delighted with Amazon's no-questions-asked policy--including a return label that I could print out. The third party involved with the Acer product may impose a 15-percent restocking fee, since I wish to return the unit. I would prefer that Amazon extend its no-hassle return policy to ALL items purchased through its website."
2,Disappointed,Was very disappointed that Rainbow 65 song began on part 2. It was not listed as part 1 or part 2 on the website.
5,fond memories from teen years.,I listened and danced to Gene Chandler's music most of my teen years. I saw him perfom at the original Regal Theatre in Chicago many times.
5,Love these guys!,"Out of all 3 albums, it's hard to choose, but if I had to, this one would be my favorite. As usual, the lyrics are creative and the music covers a variety of styles. These 2 guys and their band are all multi-talented."
2,Maca mud,"Unfortunately, I never got any of the benefits of the Maca Magic Powder because I couldn't use it. I couldn't use it because I couldn't get over the taste. It is definitely an acquired taste. I'm sure it has healthy qualities but if you have a sensitive palate, you may want to find your antioxidents and vitamins elsewhere."
5,This is a Thich Nhat Hanh classic and it beautifully distills most of his core teachings here.,"I could have not chose a better selection of Thay's teaching from several of his books. This one really made the right choice of all of them. The essence of mindfulness, his trademark, is here everywhere and one cannot escape it. He is such a great teacher. Other of his books are not as complete as this one. Although this book is complete in it itself, it does serve as an intro to the books from which this chapters were taken, whetting your appetite for more. I would recommende this book to anyone interested in buddhism, experienced and otherwise. There is really nothing that I can find wanting here, except for it not being longer."
3,Being in the present moment,"If you haven't read anything by Thich Nhat Hanh, this would be the book you want to read first. Gradually, the reader enters into the peaceful realm of this gentle teacher. From short, but meaningful essays to beautiful poetry, the journey through this collection is one that provides material to live by. The book concludes with the fourteen mindfulness trainings. My personal favorite is #7 which begins ""Aware that life is available only in the present moment and that it is possible to live happily in the here and now,..."" Enjoy!"
2,The book is mired with grammatical errors.,"I have never read a worse written book. There are grammatical errors everywhere. Sometimes the pictures do not agree with the instructions, which makes some lessons difficult to follow. I must admit however, that despite these blunders, I managed to attain a reasonably good understanding of Access. The book is good for beginners. Do not expect to become an Access Expert by reading this book."
4,Forgotten Gem,Del Shannon's 'The Further Adventures Of Charles Westover' reminds me of The Zombies Odessey & Oracle. Sort of a forgotten gem from the same time. Very nice.[DW]
3,Beautiful music but same old melodies,"Needless to say, Michael Hoppe's music is beautiful, lyrical, expressive, and passionate. However, after purchasing several of his CDs, I keep hearing the same old tunes played with different orchestrations. Don't get me wrong...I love the melodies...but once you have heard a tune it gets trite after multiple playings, no matter how beautiful.Michael needs to let go of his old themes and ask for fresh melodies to come forward.Of course, if you haven't heard his earlier works, you will enjoy this one."
5,Great Info,It's very informative and it answered all of my questions. I would recommend this for anyone interested in having rats as pets!
3,Tasty??,"I am sure that the product does all it says it does, but I'll go back to the traditional taste of Crest or Colgate. The flavor just does nothing for me."
5,Great brush,Love this brush. Super effective and does not rip your hair out. Soft and dense bristles really get your hair looking good.
4,alexander ponomarenko,"I really enjoyed this CD that was probably given to me by Mr. P. himself at a radio station WRFG-FM Atlanta function. Great poetry, sound, and an into to the fact that IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE, LIVING IN THE GHETTO, CAN'T EVEN BUY CRACK, AND wy des on the moon. This is the only such album I've played on my radio show in the past 30 years, but I really enjoyed it, and play it along with Al Bowley, Como, and Merle Haggard, et al."
4,Not bad,"This trampoline works great for my exercise purposes, but is a little ""tight"" for my 3-year old, who we actually purchased it for. Also, can't take apart and put together as easily as the manufacturer would have you believe. We just leave it assembled and roll it into the garage when not using it."
1,Cheaply constructed - DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!,"After using my Stamina 38 inch for less than a month, it is already falling apart!!!! Two of the springs have already popped making the entire trampoline unstable. I haven't misused the product and I only weigh 200 lbs.The springs are made of cheap metal - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
2,I seen better.,"The size of the round trampoline is not big enough for safety which means that you must move up and down on the same spot. If not, you are more likely to be thrown off or jeopardize your legs/feet/ankle, even your whole body. It is okay but conducive."
4,good one for kids,my 3-year old had a blast with this when we assembled it for her in the backyard. Good buy. My friend and I tried a few jumps too and it is sturdy. The product manual could have been more informative. Note that you need to turn it face down when assembling initially.
3,"Decent, but needs some improving","This is a good trampoline. It's pretty durable, strong and well built, and I've had no problems with it. However, I certainly wouldn't class it as being a folding trampoline. The legs need to be removed for it to store flat. If you remove the legs, the skirting slips. And it snaps shut like a snare, so watch your hands. I needed help just to open it the first time.Overall, I'm happy with it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone with limited storage space"
1,Breaks in no time!,"Well, first of all, I never folded it up, because it was very difficult to fold, so I would just roll it into a closet. I would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise.I had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and I had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard. I weigh 110 lbs! I really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person."
2,Lamp left me in the dark,"Head band and lamp are very comfortable, but the light is extremely dim and almost useless. If you actually need to see what you are doing or where you are going this is not the light for you."
1,Composition of blocks from works of other authors,"Bunch of blocks and citations from other authors with absolutely no explanations. It doesnt look like author understands anything that he borrowed from others to compose this book or dare to give one calculation example or derive a formula. Horrible, horrible book for a novice."
2,Not too great!!,This game was fun in the beginning but the object of this game is the same through out the whole game which gets a little boring...i recommend this game for smaller children because it isnt too hard but not for older children...i hope this review has helped.
2,Error on the Cover; So-so Depiction of Ops,"What genius puts Naval aviator wings on the cover of a UDT book? The publisher should've gotten something THAT simple correct. That mistake alone cost the book a star in the rating, and it wasn't the author's fault.However... this is an interesting and necessary read for UDT history, but a little disappointing. A lot of work goes into these oral histories, though, and the author is to be commended. Agree with some of the other comments. Too much training; needed more action. The Naked Warriors is the first book to read on the subject, followed by America's First Frogman and The Water is Never Cold."
4,World War II,The book was just as described. Accounts about World War II from actual soldiers who served. I found it interesting and informative.
3,Too salty,"This was one of my favorite Tasty Bite entrees, for years and years. But the latest batch I ordered was way too salty.Amazon, clean up your old web pages! You have links to free shipping, Tasty Bite at $65 and over at tastybite.com -- and that is obsolete. Now it's free shipping at $75 and over.There's also an old web page showing 25% off Tasty Bite for products ordered between two dates in 2008. A disgrace."
4,Salty,"The kashmir spinach Tasty bite is very good, but definitely salty. That is the first flavor I taste; however, it has a variety of other spices and tastes very good overall. It is very soupy, and would be better with rice."
3,Too Salty,The sodium amount is 693 mg per serving with 2 servings per box. It tastes too salty also. Adding things like unsalted rice & beans helps. I do like the intensity of the other spices and the ease of use and storage.
4,Yum!,"This is my second favorite Tasty Bite meal so far, out of the 4 or so I've tried. It does have a strong spinach flavor, but I happen to like that flavor. Works well over rice, or with naan or pita."
3,"The Worst LOOKING Food I've Ever Eaten, But Not The Worst Tasting!","I have to say that, while I am not a person who needs my food to be aesthetically pleasing as well as tasteful, this meal was very difficult for even me to begin. The taste is fine, as long as you like spinach, but I would advise that the taster at least have some pasta or rice on the size to lessen the unpleasant view. If you are not deterred by the look of a food (I mean really NOT DETERRED) or if you can manage with your eyes closed, then dig in, because the taste is fine."
2,too spicey,"We love Indian food, but this products is way too spicy. Some batches are moderate, but we opened one and it was filled with peppers and spice."
1,Canned Spinach Taste,"This has the overwhelming acidic taste that is characteristic of canned spinach, that frozen and fresh don't have. If you know what I'm talking about and like that taste, then this is OK, but for us it's inedible."
2,"Kashmir Spinach isn't good, but other Tasty Bite items really are great","Kashmir Spinach is the third Tasty Bite offering I have tried.The look and taste is quite unappealing.We would not consider buying it again.We had high hopes based on how much we loved other Tasty Bite items we tried, but no luck with this one.I encourage you to try Agra Peas or Jaipur Vegetables instead, two Tasty Bite items that are really fantastic."
5,Great quality,They are great quality. Very well made toy and very entertaining. My 5 year old loves making jewelry with these for her friends and teachers.
4,"Nice set, but easily scattered","This is a very nice beading set, appropriate for even small kids (3-5 yrs old). Something to be aware of: There is exactly one layer of beads in the box. What you see in the picture is exactly what you get. The tray is a nice sturdy wood, but it's very shallow - about half an inch deep - so you'll likely need to find something else to keep all the beads in. It doesn't come with a lid or anything to keep the beads in place, so I can see them getting scattered and lost very quickly once the plastic shrink wrap is removed. I give four stars for the overall product for this reason."
4,Great Toy...Not Enough Pieces,"This bead set is really cute and very fun. My children have made some very cute necklaces and bracelets and I'm glad to have been the recipient of such lovely, handmade gifts. They're made of wood and are finished in lovely colors. All the letters are printed nicely. The only complaint is that there aren't that many beads."
5,Hours of fun !,"My (almost) 3 year old loves this product.She will sit at the table and bead away.The colors are beautiful and it is wood so...durable!The laces are great; vibrant colors and good to use over and over again.My girl will wear her necklace for a day...loose interest...I will sneak it out of her room..undo it and put it back in the box (which is also made of wood and great for storage, even though it would make it PERFECT if it came with a lid! and we will make more!"
5,Very cute and fun for girly girls,I bought this for my six year old niece and she has really enjoyed making necklaces for everyone. The beads and string are good quality as well as being very cute.
2,The paint came off!,"We have only used this little set a few times since we got it, and we had fun putting necklaces together (my daughter is 3). However, she wore one of the necklaces for a day and by the end of the day, the paint was gone from the beads on the side that touched her body! She said, ""It's broken!"" And I was unnerved to see paint just peeling off every bead on her necklace. This toy is not durable, and could even be dangerous if that paint is ingested. I am really disappointed because I think of Melissa and Doug toys as being durable. Also, there is not a good way to store these as is. We had to find something to put the beads in since there is no top to this box."
3,Picture is deceiving,"I thought these beads would be larger. The whole box is smaller than I thought and the beads are less than an inch in size. The holes are tiny too so it will be pretty hard for little fingers to string these together. By the time a child has the dexterity to string beads this small, I think they will have outgrown these cutesy colorful ones and would prefer jewelry bead sets instead. They would be a little too babyish for an older child. I was buying this set for a 4-year-old for Christmas but I am sending it back and getting something else. This set what just not what I was expecting."
5,Great toy for the kindergarten set,"My 5 year old daughter loves this toy. Stringing the beads is made easy with the shoelace type strings, and she has so much fun stringing letters to make jewelry for siblings and friends. Great product."
3,Do you hate your friends?,then buy this for their kids. these pieces will get everywhere and you will have to dig them out of your feet.
3,Fun but imperfect,"My daughter received this set for her December birthday. She was so excited from the moment she saw it. Ultimately, it has turned out to be frustrating. The beads are clearly mass-produced and not quality-checked very closely. Plenty of them have partially-obscured openings. From an adult's perspective, this may not be a big deal; but for a preschooler, its infuriating. These are also bound to make a mess unless you invest in something else to store them in. The nice-looking wood tray they come in has no lid. One of these days I will take the Dremel and smooth out the holes, and find a nice storage box for the beads. For now, the set is sitting up on a high shelf for another day."
4,Fun for 6 year old,Very fun. Good quality items. A lid would be nice or other packaging. They ended up in a large baggie.
5,Excellent book for users. Well written and easy to read.,Excellent book for users who want to now the new features in Windows 2000 Professional. Very well written and easy to read. In two hours I was able to outline the new features and try them on the BETA version. The first two chapters give the reader a great introduction to the subject.
2,Not much beyond how things will look,"When buying this book, I expected a much deeper insight on the new technology involved in this product. What I found, instead, is a list of wonderful new buttons and taskbars. Is there anything beyond this colorful new interface ? I am still wondering."
3,Decent book,This book is for my Logic and Reasoning class at the University of California. Not the funnest of subjects but I guess the book has all the necessary information for the course. Glad to have it.
1,"Sorry, this was unenjoyable","I'm sorry, but this video just didn't hold my daughter's interest. The women who narrarated the video was boring and monotonous. Worst of all, as a native speaker of Japanese, I was offended by the narrator's pronunciation and the obvious lack of input by native Japanese speakers into the video."
2,A Copout,"With American settings, food, housing, people, kids, clothing, kitchens and the ""Japanese"" in English, this is better suited for people wanting to learn English. International Baby 101 is the real thing."
5,Small Fry Japanese,My 2 year old enjoyes this video & repeats the words. It is fun to watch him 'speaking'another language. The graphics are good & the picture changes frequently keeping small minds attentive. The program built simple sentences slowly. There was also enough repetition to start to learn the words. Overall the best language video I have seen.
2,Not a HighTech-thriller,"Exposure starts in a really strong way. But then it turns out to be one of those books that just pretends to be a story about high-tech and computers - but is just a ordinary chase and run thriller, with computers as something of a side effect. To bad. This book is just The pelican Breef - in another way. If YOU want to read a REAL computer-thriller, go for Duane Franklet's ""Bad Memory"". THAT is a real techno-thriller all the way."
5,The possible are really out there.,"Exposure is a fast pace book. R.J. Pineiro from Austin Texas works with computers therefore the computer science in the book is update. Austin has many semiconductor compancies that make chips from everyday computer systems to the miltary. The pressure to get the product onto the market is high. Plus, the turnover rate on the clean floor is high. The possible of the a bug on the chips is real. Many examples of problems that could occur with one bug kept me interested to the point I could not put the book down. The books does not have any slow parts to get past. This is a good book for people who enjoy computer thrillers."
4,Not just for kids!,"Batman:Vengeance starts off with the simple plot of a kidnapping by The Joker. But the plot thickens as The Joker falls off a bridge to his death and all of a sudden Joker imposters show up, ready to destroy Batman.THAT'S ALL I'M TELLIN' ABOUT THE PLOT...don't wanna ruin it for ya. Now, as I said, this game isn't just for little kids. 1 reason is you don't even have to like the show, comics, or movies to like this! (I don't.) The 2nd reason is it's a fun adventure game that would really appeal to everyone. The 3rd is it's challinging, unlike...ummm, a Spider Man game. And the 4th and final:it's rated T!However;There is a problem, and that would be the controls. You'll have to retry the same mission over and over, which sometimes makes you want to break the control.(And we've all exprienced that peticular feeling.) But, if you can hold in your anger, this will be an enjoyable game."
4,Very good,This game is great to play. It has lots of challenging levels and it's great that they used the voices from the animated series. The only problem is that it's very easy to get stuck on a level.
3,"Too easy, but great graphics","I like Batman's Vengance but I was a little dissapointed on how easy the game was. The graphics and plot make up for the simplicticness. I rented it on a Friday, and beat it on Saturday. Of course I didn't buy it, but if the price was lowered I might buy it because I love Batman."
4,For Batman fans.,"This game is great for any fan of Batman. The graphics are impressive, the animations are original and the story is great. At times you feel like you are actually watching the Batman animated series. The voiceovers are all original. (Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill etc.) The soundtrack is also impressive. The only shortcomming of the game is that the gameplay lacks a little bit, but the story and graphics make up for it. I enjoyed this game and I feel that any Batman fan would do the same."
3,alot of people said this game was hard!!!!!!!!!!,"but i took 8 hours on this one , i like some of the puzzles and the only boss that kinda got to me was mister freeze this game was a walk through i enjoy being a dark crusader , it has its set backs the graphics sucks and the story was less than interesting the gas works was fun my friends overated the difficulty this game was fun not the best out there but worht playing rent it i wish i did......... i actually bought it so good luck laterzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,Decent Batman game-- Ben N. At The Games,okay okay this game wasnt the best but sure wasnt the worst i admit i was quite entertained when playing it the reason i gave it 3 stars was because sometimes it gotten boring where i did not want to play it and on top of that it was easy like all super hero games in my opinion this game would most likely make a great rental but if you want to buy then dont waste your cash but for me being a critic i give this adventure 3 stars enjoy i hope they make sequels
1,Cant see this tedious game,"I hate this game. First off, I cant see it. It's too dark. I made it as bright as possible, and I still get a headache from squinting. I can hardly make out the very important ledges I seem to keep falling off of. The controls are awkward, and the levels are unnecessarily tedious. The whole batarang thing is a joke. I'm a huge Batman fan, but I can even stomach the cartoon after playing this game. It's almost as bad as the N64 Superman game. Nothing could be that bad."
4,WHATCHA LOOKIN AT?!,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why am i crying you ask? *sniffles*because....my cat farted he blew up our house.....now we're poor. Oh yeah batman vengeance is the best according to vibe magazine well gotta go floss my cat
3,Better Off Renting...........,This isn't the best PS2 has to offer. This is a rental game cause at least then you only payed (...) bucks for it instead of (...). Somes scenes are just way too dark and the character control is not the best and the graphics aren't anything to get excited over. Don't get me wrong it's not the worse game out there but if you're like me and picky about games you buy then stay away from purchasing this one. Go rent it.
4,Good and bad,"The game is beautiful. The character rendering, the plot, and the sheer fighting ability of Batman are all first rate.The game is misguided. The load time seems excessive but I could look past that if the designers gave me more people to fight. The few people you actually battle in the game are the only spots of enjoyment. The car and jet scenes are poorly conceived and tedious."
4,Metal Gear meets spider man,This game is a lot of fun. Batman has over 500 moves. The fighting system is great. There is a 1st person mode to use your gadgets with. The sound is good. There are different game modes like the batmobile batplane and free fall fighting. It is very long with a deep un raveling story. I gave it 4 stars because the graphics can get a little fuzzy but they aren't bad. Very good game.
2,Gorgeous game killed my bad control,"This game makes your PS2 shine graphically but the poor controls and limited scope of action will drive you nuts. Batman will fall from catwalks so easily and miss doorways so often that you almost think he is still in training. The gameplay is okay, but you are scripted in what you can do, so this is limiting. I would say rent, but do not buy."
2,Could be better.,"I'd probably like this game more if I hadn't just played the new PS2 Spider-Man game. There's just no competition. The controls in this game are clumsy, and it's way too easy to fall off a building with no way to save yourself. The idea of Batman mincing along the edge of roofs carefully looking for a place to launch his bat-grapple detracts from the flavor of the game to me.If you're looking for a game where you can feel like a superhero, jumping off roofs with no concern for yourself and trusting your abilities to save you in time, then go with Spider-Man. A far more exhilarating superhero experience overall."
2,Stick to watching the cartoon.,"This game is little more than a glorified version of the cartoon with some frustrating game-play interspersed throughout. It is very true to the cartoon in style and with the same voice acting. The only problem is that while the cartoon is entertaining, this game is not. It is a frustrating mix of jumping, punching, and trying to find the right gadget in time to knock out a lackey who keeps coming back over and over again.If you think you might want to buy this game do yourself a favor; rent it. After that you will be glad that you saved your money.Trust me on this one. Otherwise you will be sorely dissapointed."
2,Print too small to read,The photos of the recipes are quite nice but what good are they when the directions are so small it takes a magnifying glass to read them.
1,It's an ordinary Torx wrench,"An ordinary Torx wrench will not hold the screw to the tool, thus making it darn near impossible to install a screw that is at any angle other than vertical unless you can hold the screw with your fingers while installing. In my case, I wanted to install a screw that is buried 3"" deep down a hole. Obviously, you can't hold the screw with your fingers and unless you can turn the work upside down, the screw will fall off the tool and you can't get it started. Tape/PlayDough/other adhesive might do the trick but I thought the classy way would be to use a magnet.The only magnetic's involved with this tool is used to hold the Torx bit to the driver..No residual magnetism to hold the screw to the bit. So what you have is an ORDINARY TORX WRENCH."
4,Great but.... not silent,"This is a great cross trainer. It arrived on time, it was relatively easy to assemble and seems to be working really great. The only thing is that I live in a small apartment and it is not that silent. I work out on the machine and keep thinking that my downstairs neighbor will be coming up to complain any minute. But it is still a great machine that gives you a great cardiovascular workout."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","I have had this product for 2 months now. And this is my take on it as of now...1. The description says ""six pace-based workouts"". Despite reading reviews that said this is not true, I got it to test the truth myself:-) Well, there are NO ""pace-based workouts"". Did not want the trouble of dismantling and returning, so I am using it. But beware when buying - you will not get any inbuilt programs.2. Assembly was fairly simple, but a team of two is advised to assemble. And tighten the bolts!3. There is a bit of a squishy noise from the paddle arrangement. Maybe greasing would help, but have not tried for fear of spoiling the carpet.4. A little unstable - wobbles at times. I remember reading some mention of gym mats, but have not tried it.5. Stride is short, so tall people - think twice.Looks like I am griping, but actually it is an OK piece for the price.As for the durability, I will come back in 6-8 months and tell you how it goes."
3,"Good price, not so great workout","It has a great price, but you get what you pay for. It has a very short stride. If you are looking for a cheap workout, it is a good machine. but do not be fooled by the ""silent"" part. It is not loud, but not exactly quiet either."
5,"Hard to Assemble, but worth it","I will not gloss over the fact that this product was difficult to assemble. A second set of hands is certainly required, and possible a strong aptitude for hands-on activities. Moving beyond the assembly, I am very happy with the product. It feels stable and strong even when you start going fast (and are close to the weight limit). So far it has been a great value. would recommend this purchase to anyone with a limited budget, who is seeking a quality machine."
1,Poorly Made - Pass this one up,"The computer quit working in three months. The axel is not solid. It is welded, two piece axel. The right side axel has broken twice at the weld. I am putting it in the trash and looking for a good one."
4,Incorrect Advertising,"I purchased this item because the advertising said - The machine offers six pre-programmed workouts: fat burn, maximum fat burn, hill, interval, mountain, and aerobic. This machine DOES NOT come with these pre programmed workouts. I contacted both Stanima and Amazon about their advertising and they have corrected it some but still misleading. It now claims to have ... six pace-based workouts allow you to vary your activity to keep it fresh! Well please tell me where they are cause they aren't on my machine!!! I like the machine, it is quiet and easy to use, but did purchase it for the 6 pre programmed exercised that don't exist, except in the advertising. If you're looking for a machine without that function this one is it."
2,petal issue,This machine is ok for the money but the foot petal keeps falling out. It has done it 3 times and I am now looking for ways to return it.
3,Decent value so far.,"This seems to be a pretty decent value model. It's definitely not as sturdy as a high priced model you'd find at a gym, but so far it's pretty stable. We'll see how it holds up after 3 months of heavy use.Someone that has been using these at the gym for a long time and is used to higher resistance would be disappointed with how light level 8 resistance is, but it's fine for me.My biggest complaint is that the fitness monitor that came with it didn't work right out of the box, but the Stamina company has said they'll send me a new one.Bottom line, as long as I get a working fitness monitor, this was a great buy for the price."
4,Hmmmmmmmm......,"I think this machine is good for starters but can get a little boring at times........ Pop in a dvd and pump those thighs!!!!!!It is sturdy and didnt take that long to put together, clear instructions. Doesnt take up alot of room, isnt an ""eye-sore"" in the room and I feel it was a good deal for the price of $199.00 on sale.......Free shipping didnt hurt either! All in all I give it FOUR STARZZZZZ!"
1,broke after a month,"I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem.I'll spend the money for a good one next time."
2,A 6-month product,"I bought this after comparing a lot of other machines on amazon. This seemed to be on the cheaper side and I was not willing to invest in a more expensive machine. Initially this seemed to work out great, I was able to use this machine 5 days a week for 4 months with no problems(dropping 30 lbs in the process), other than a little noise.But after that, it just went downhill. The axle just broke while i was on it. The right part just snapped from the axle. I had to pay to get a new axle (since it was out of warranty and they sent me a different sized axle the first time), and after installing it, it seemed to work fine for sometime. But now the machine has just started to squeak really bad. And no amount of grease has managed to help it. I have to just put it down to bad design. A lot of joints seem to get more pressure than they can handle (and I dont consider myself to be that overweight).So like some of the other reviews, you basically pay for what you get."
3,elliptical review,The screen did not function properly and I've had troubles just getting that replaced instead of sending the whole thing back. The rest of the trainer works like it should and was simple to put together.
2,Not bad for the cost,"This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs. It is fairly quiet, not silent. It is shakier than I had hoped. The wire to the monitor came broken."
3,Spray bottle without a spray nozzle?,"I would have thought that something called ""spray bottle"" would come with a spray attachment. Guess not! I would like to be able to spray down surfaces at work."
4,Story time,"My son is only 16 months old, so he likes to have things read to him over and over again. He really enjoyed this book because it had music to go along with the story."
4,Good Resource,I've found this book to be a good resource and insight into the mechanics of communication. Many fine examples that can be modified and put to use in a myriad of situations.
1,Waste of money,"If you want a REAL Makiwara, MAKE ONE~! For example, Just wrap a thick phone book with a Duct tape would make an excellent Makiwara."
1,Different songs,I am not satisfied with the item because it has completely different songs than the songs described in the description of the item.
2,Don't waste your time,"Fontane's examination of upper class Germany in the nineteenth century ultimately proves to be a scathing indictment of the ""me first"" mentality, but, and this is important: NOTHING HAPPENS. For about 200 pages Fontane wastes the readers' time by doing what could be done in about 30 pages: He shows how messed up the whole aristocratic scene was. Yeah, so they commit adultery an lie to each others face, you don't have to drag it out for so damn long. All in all, it makes me feel good to NOT be a rich upper class waster. And once the hammer drops (about 35 pages before the book ends) it still doesn't matter that Fontane has built these characters up: They are all the same exact characters in different bodies. I didn't feel anything for Effi or Instetten or anyone else except Roswitha, and her only because her dad chased her aroudn with a red-hot poker when she was a young girl."
5,not standard description for continuous optimization,This book is not described standardly for continuous optimization.
4,Not too bad,"I'm glad I purchased this video and made it part of my collection. I have, however, been a taebo fan for quite some time now so this video was not a challenge for me at all. I liked it because it is the perfect video for those days when you don't feel like exercising, but you don't want to skip your workout. If you are advanced and looking for a challenge you may want to look elsewhere, this probably will not be the video for you."
1,Palm Pack Productivity,"This is pretty much a useless waste of an SD card. The little programs on it are of not much use. All of them can be downloaded as Freeware off the net. I'm glad I only paid 95 cents for it, that's more that it's worth."
2,What a d(r)owner!,"This book is DEPRESSING! I have nothing against children's books dealing with death, but in this one, grandpa just up and drowns at the end. Very sad."
2,This one should have been better.,"I really wish record companies would stop putting out disco compilations that consist of short versions or radio edits. They just don't get it. True disco fans are after extended or 12 inch versions. Houston's classic ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" and the house music standard ""I'm Here Again"" end during the best parts of each song. I was so disappointed that I gave my copy of this cd away for a ride to work."
3,Not the correct track listing...a little disspointed.,"I'm glad that ""Sunshower"" has been reissued at a reasonable price because while this set does have a few tracks from those sessions, I agree with the other reviewer that the extended versions of ""Don't Leave me This Way"" and ""I'm Here Again"" should have been included. ""Me and Bobby McGee"" and ""Love Machine"" are also absent. Go with the other MOTOWN (US) version with the green cover (the track listing for that album is incorrectly listed for this IMPORT release)."
2,Still no Sunshower,"When will the idiots at Universal release Sunshower,even on their limited release,overpriced Hip-O Select series. The disco stuff sounded old before the year '70s ened. Sunflower is timeless. Ask Paul Schaffer."
1,it doesnt work at all,"Dont buy this item, because the problem is the same (like the old one water coming from everywhere) and by the way, we hired a expert plumber to fix these thing."
5,A great read,"I have always been a fan, and was more than happy to read this book. I am captivated by the way Andy writes, and I am always left wanting more. Aight, I am not the best reviewer, but I know what I like and this is on my top ten list of books that are amazing."
2,Myopic existentialist tripe of the worst kind,"Like other myopic cretins in the ilk of the author, they attempt to lump metaphysics in general (soul, 'ghosts' etc.) in the arena of nonsense like bigfoot, UFOS and other rube-based twaddle with genuine metaphysis & physics . The very foundations of physical investigation has come down to us thru Plato, Pythagoras, and Aristotle, of which said works were 90% based in investigating metaphysical ('paranormal' in the ethos of modern parlance) Subjects such as the soul, divine mechanics etc. The authors profane mental psychopathy is a sophomoric attempt to lump any and all metaphysics into the arena of foolishness of the like such as astrology, psychics, bigfoot and UFOs; this is at best a poorman fallacy."
3,Cover Me Windsor,"I am a real foodie, and I rely on good pans. The pans I use are mainly Valphalon,. Cusininart and Magnalite. I needed a 4.5 qt Windsor, and this Farberware was the only one I could find.It is very light -- not as hefty as a comparable Cusionart or Calphalon. This leads me to believe that it won't be as efficient in conducting heat. I have only used it to boil water for pasta and potatoes, and for this task it performs well."
3,Pluses and minuses...,"I was given this book to read by the health nurse after what I believe was an unnecessary cesarean with my first child. This book was hard for me to read at first, because it added to the anger I felt over my c-section. I almost couldn't finish it. As I continued to read, though, I did gain some insight into how to cope with my grief and overcome negative feelings. I managed to let go of some of the anger and sadness I felt. I eventually had a midwife attended VBAC at home, which was empowering and beautiful. If you are reading this book after having had a c-section, just beware - it is definitely difficult to read at first, but worth it to see it through to the end."
1,"Polemics, not practical advice","This book will doubtless be viewed as a manifesto by thosewho are angry and bitter at cesarean births in general, ortheir own birth in particular. The combination of the author'spersonal politics and the generally bitter stories of otherwomen may serve as a balm to those who believe they havesuffered similar experiences and need to vent. However, tothe extent that the book bills itself as a guide to avoiding asecond cesarean, it does not succeed. There are few if anypractical tips to be found among the pages, and little up todate medical research. In short, read it to get your bloodpressure up, but for practical information on how toactually succeed in a natural child birth after cesarean, tryanother source"
4,"Good Beats, Nice Mix","There are good songs on this CD. Real good for breaking. Once I find the money, I'm gettin this CD. I hope they will come out wit more volumes of them."
1,Don't Bother!,"I found Revenge of the B-Boy (which I bought on Amazon) is much better than this CD. The only good breakin' song is Electric Boogie, all the rest are songs nobody liked in the eighties, they're garbage."
3,CD was quite good!,"Well I recently listened to the CD and I found the music pretty phat! But a few songs wasn't too good, but overall I think its a good CD!"
3,Of course there's a cameo!,"Rene Gosciny, Asterix in Belgium (Dargaud, 1980)Belgians? Tough? So said Caesar. (""Of all the Gauls, the Belgae are the bravest"" can be found in De Bello Gallico.) Vitalstatistix finds out that Romans are actually relived to be being posted to the Roman camp of Aquarium, because the village of indomitable Gauls is nothing compared to the Belgian campaign. Needless to say, Vitalstatistix, along with Asterix and Obelix, has to go to Belgium and challenge the Belgian cheiftain to a Roman-bashing contest...The most notable thing about Asterix in Belgium is that this is the last of the Asterix books upon which Goscinny worked (he suffered a fatal heart attack whilst working on the text for the book; Uderzo had already completed the drawings, leading to legal action from Dargaud to force Uderzo to complete the text). Uderzo takes over with somewhat surprising competence; readers shouldn't notice the transition. ***"
1,junk sprinkler,Don't waste your money on these poorly made sprinklers buy rainbird and be done with it the first time. some don't work after installing and if they work they don't last for long.
3,Good Dancehall Material,"If you are a Beenie connoisseur, the first thing you will probably notice about this album is he was defenitely inspired to reflect the style of his earlier years (early nineties)which is a refreshing change. This is not Beenie Man's best work but never-the-less good dancehall material. There are a few especially catchy songs with good reggae beats (Boogie Down, Feel Good, Recruiting Girl), and, of course, there are a few tracks that (I believe) should have been dropped (Green Card Buddy, a very strange song). It is obvious that Beenie was not looking for American airplay (as it is not produced extremely well, and sounds like it was recorded in my bedroom). Overall in this reflection of Beenie's past as he approaches the new millenium, you won't find any seriously inspiring or enthrawling tunes (as in Many Moods of Moses) but rather you find Beenie's more hyped up side, carrying on the dancehall tradition into 2000."
3,My 1st Beenie Man CD...,"I just had the pleasure of seeing Beenie Man live and I really enjoyed his performance. He sounded great. So, I HAD to own some of his music. Knowing nothing about any of his previous albums, I ran into this one. Y2K was used, and pretty inexpensive. I was impressed. I mean, the entire album isn't great, but there are a few really good tunes. Check out Boogie Down, and Feel Good for starters. Mis Angela isn't bad either. Again, not the best album I've ever heard, but a pretty good introduction to the Beenie Man. I am now a fan!"
1,How upsetting!,"I am a Beenie fan but this album was VERY DISAPPOINTING! After The Doctor, which was an excellent album, this was pure garbage. I hope he bounces back from this one."
5,What a great dance tune!,"This is a great tune! Apparently, based on the theme from the movie ""The Last of the Mohicans"". I have not listened to other Dumonde singles, but I would highly recommend this to anyone. You get 4 versions of the single on the cd, nice move :)"
1,another order I have never received 2 months later,This is the second mask that I have not received since January. Still been given the run around.
1,False Advertising of Product,"I ordered this mask based on the picture and description shown. When it arrived, it is nothing more than a child's Halloween mask; the same sold by wweshop.com for $9.99! Very dissatisfied as this was a Christmas present and now I have no time to replace it. This is false advertising in my book. They need to replace the picture with a true picture of the product being sold for $42.99."
4,Theres no way you can call this a weak album,"How can you even say that this album is weak, especailly with tracks like 5, 6, 7, especailly 9, and 10. I haven't listened to Jeru's other albums, but I know this stuff is good."
2,(2+half) very little SUPA about this KLICK,"In my opinion this is defintely JERU's weakest effort so far out his 4 albums. Granted there was no dj premier this time, but surely with his respect+contacts within the game he could've found someone that could've AND would've done a better job with the production. Apart from 5 tracks where JERU did an excellent (+somewhat suprising) job the remainder are just plain wack, as far as production. However, as with all JERU's tracks, the lyrics are dynamite. His ability to spit hard yet thought provoking rhymes make him what he is. As far as MIZMARVEL, i'd say she's ok but would've prefered if she hadn't got an amazing ""3 solo tracks"" out of the 12 on here. JERU himself is only on 9 joints in total. Thankfully JERU has learned from this experience+didnt handle any of the production or have any guests on his follow up to this, ""divine design"", and the result is much better. Not the worst you'll hear but i suppose 1 ""blip"" in 4 albums is alright."
5,he never fails,as always jeru damages any one who tries to compete. this album has bangin tracks. for anyone who likes underground or is faithful to it this cd is a must. with his dope style jeru will teach you and broaden your views. people need to hear more of him so maybe they will smartin the (...) up. Ya Playin Yourself is definately a banger in my cd player along with many other tracks on this cd. if you like gangstarr youll like jeru. he never fails to amaze me. (...) oh that is hot. he is one of the most complex thought out lyricists out just like guru and afu ra. if you like lyrics with some meaning and just plain raw talent jeru is your man.
3,wrath of the something,"Jeru is full of it. For a self-styled ascetic, he doesn't do much deep thinking. And I'd take his carping about hip-hop culture seriously if he didn't revel in its excesses, basing songs on cross-genderizing putdowns, a romp with Billie Jean (Michael Jackson's) and a narrative conceit swiped from Ice Cube. ""I don't playa-hate ya, it's not in my divine nature"" -- tell that to the ""99.9 percent of these n----s"" who ""ain't s---."" Still, the hook to his anti-pop posturing is the only one that works: This album sounds good on its own terms. The production is often jingly, often smoked-out, always meaty; taking over technical duties from Gang Starr's DJ Premier, Jeru sees his music through a natural evolution. And even though his flow flattens out once in a while, he's as bold and clear as you'd expect from a guy whose selling point, so to speak, is sermonizing. Bonus points for the four tracks featuring Miz Marvel, who playa-hates stylishly."
3,close,"First off, much props to Jeru on continuing to produce great music. His flow is intact, but unfortunately, Primo is not. The production is OK, but the old school 80's electronic drums get old after a while and the sampling ain't all that great. Second, I wanna hear Jeru mostly. Marvel is tight but I want an all out Jeru lyrical adventure complete with dope beats to complement the supaMC. Third I want some nice cameo's by Afu, group home, or someone else who represented. overall it is an alright disk as the production is dark and moody for the most part. I'll stay positive and say the best is yet to come and I'll continue to support the dirtyrotten one forever. Still this don't compare to his first two."
5,Parser Design for the 21st century,"I found this powerful parser framework easy to understand (with a little help from my friends) and a pleasure to incorporate into my programmers toolbox.Aho is for Computer Scientists and Mathematicians, while the organic nature of Steve's thinking and elegant application of Design Patterns to the problem of creating an extensible parser, is more up a Biologist turned webmaster alley.In less that a few days we were able to convert IDL to WSDL, in less than 100 lines of code!The only issue I had was the text sometimes could have benefited with some graphical depiction of the concepts, or even an accompanying flash animation / demo website. Maybe in the next edition?"
5,Yoga strap.,"Not much to say, it's a yoga strap. As thick as needed, and has a metal thing at the end as in the picture."
3,Informed and Informative,"In this brief and useful history of lighthouses along the North Carolina coast, Stick shows he knows his subject and dots the seventy odd pages with a variety of interesting facts, including why each lighthouse along the Outer Banks is painted in a different pattern. I didn't know either that lighthouse development has been under Federal Government, rather than state, control since 1789. From the some things never change department: in one instance over two hundred years ago, Congress mandated construction of a lighthouse, but refused to appropriate the funds to carry out the construction. Stick's writing is workmanlike at best."
5,Best case ever for watching videos.,"This case is perfect for watching videos. The stand part is metal and swings to the back, so it is pretty sturdy. It doesn't always fit into speakers, so you have to remove it every once in a while, but if your main goal is to watch videos with ease, this case is for you!"
3,"nice looking faucet but not a 3/4"" supply hookup","thought that roman faucets were all 3/4"" water supply connection for faster tub filling, but this one is 1/2"", and that was not listed in the description of item."
2,not pleased,"Was very unhappy when I saw the doll. Although cute, nearly identical dolls just as cute can be found anywhere for a fraction of the price. I was purchasing gifts for grandchildren all in the same price range. This doll did not compare to the other items for the same amount. In order to make it ""equal"" for my granddaughter I had to supplement with other gifts for her. Would have returned it if time wasn't an issue. This doll is so overpriced I will never purchase from this company again."
1,Not usable,"This machine has only one tuner, wouldn't copy home videos (and company admitted knowing there was a flaw in the copyright protection preventing rental tapes from being copied that also prevented copying from certain camcorder manufacturers), was a bear to work with in trying to find a replacement."
2,VCR malfunction,"On the 2nd day, we discovers deck #2 will not ejecttimed programs do not always record"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this dual deck vcr on March 24, 2004. It worked for three weeks. The fist deck won't work, it doesn't keep up with the counter and it plays everything in SP. If you put in a tape that is SLP it will look like a chipmunks reunion. Oh, and if you think that it will work with tapes recorded in SP....THINK AGAIN....picture will go out every 3.5 minutes. Horrible. Couldn't get a replacement or my money back. Amazon said that I would have to go through Go Video...Go Video NEVER recontacted me. BEWARE!"
2,THESE ARE NOTORIOUS FOR BOUNCING PICTURE!!,"I've bought two of these and experienced the same problems. Tapes in LP and EP mode that were not recorded in these VCRs bounce. You may not notice it right away, but guarantee you as soon as you walk away it will, and you won't notice it until you watch the copy you made way later. Also, it doesn't produce the best picture possible. When I used my JVC VCR for playback, none of the tapes that bounced in the Go Video bounced, and the recorded tape actually had better quality than if dubbed using Deck 1 of the VCR! Unbelievable. I wish I would've realized this before I spent countless hours making copies."
4,good book,This is a good book for referencing real fight situations if that can actually be possible.The only knock I have is that some of the photography isn't up to par.All in all I would recommend that it should be in your library.
5,This book can change your life...if you're willing to do the work,"This book lays out the steps to literally change your mind and transform suffering into happiness. The process requires strong consistent effort and repeated practice, but it works!"
3,Limited in scope,"We have here a short guide to traditional Tibetan methods for developing what Americans know as the Power of Positive Thinking. The idea seems to be that one or more of these many techniques will work for you. The style is vigorous and very enthusiastic, with some of the charm of a foreign way of speaking. You can read through the whole book very fast, but it is an instruction manual, so you really need to try a few of the methods and see how you do. Worth a look!"
1,Not practical,"I wanted to like this book, but didn't find anything practical about it. The premise is great, turn your problems into ways for personal growth, but HOW? Never go that far, so no real practical value for me."
5,Awesome,"Awesome book on renewable energy. Thanks to these tips, I now know how I will build it. AAAA++++"
3,Solar energy,Provides the needed basic information to beginners like me in a clear and easy to understand language. Well illustrated.
3,Entry Level Reading,"Well written, a good first-step book on home solar power. Recommended for those who are curious. The real work will begin later."
4,Good overall introduction to solar power,Good book if you just want to learn about solar without all the techinical stuff.
4,Very Good Basic Overview,"This book gives a very good basic overview of the technology available and how it works. My only complaint is that it seems geared towards cooler climates. There is absolutely no information in the book about really hot climates, e.g., how does extreme heat affect PV efficiency? Not everyone lives in upstate New York or Northern California."
3,"Very basic information, a first step book","This book provides only general and basic information about solar power and grid-tied home solar systems. As an overview and basic primer if you're beginning to consider solar power it will help. If you're looking for more in-depth information on solar power, equipment, system or installation guidance you'll be disappointed."
4,sunny,Very informative and easy to read. Recommend this for everybody who would like to make a change in using energy.
2,nothing new,"Having read everything on the internet that I could it was a rehash. I wanted a technical book but this is not it. It is written in an informal style that is a waste of words. It barely mentioned what I wanted to know and told me what I already knew which is this; Like any technology, the more you spend for solar the more you get."
1,Avoid at all Costs ! ! ! ! !,"Do Not BUY! As the 4.x successor to the very populate R/3 3.x Transactions Handbook, sometimes known as the ""Black Book"" in the R/3 consulting industry, this version was more than a little disappointing.This book offers the user nothing more than a very simple list of every SAP R/3 4.x transactions with nothing more than SAP's single line, short description, to support a transaction's use and syntax, Basically this book reads like an index listing, not a reference manualI am an independent SAP BASIS Trainer and Consultant with 5 plus years experience with SAP R/3. After reviewing my copy, I returned the book in 24 hours."
2,It is nearly impossible.,"It is nearly impossible to write a Tcode referrence book, but you want to re-write or edit all of the SAP online help files."
3,OK Radio when on sale,Bought two of these for gifts while they were on sale. They were great for the price but not worth the MSRP. Not the easiest to to operate but fine for weather reports and basic AM/FM use. The CB quality leaves much be desired.
2,Dissatisfied,Item was much smaller than I thought it would be. Weather radio works great but that is all. Unable to pick up any shortwave signals. One positive thing it works without batteries. Wish I had done more research before I bought it.
1,$69.00 at TigerGPS.com,Shop around. This radio is way over priced. Under 100 max. Not many options at this price point. Many poor reviews
3,expecting more,"i was a little disappointed when i received this item comes in a huge box,but is the size of a small hard back bookmade of matel type plastic, and looks very cheap.....as far as proformance could use a longer anntena..."
2,Not impressed,"Purchased this item to use mainly in the home as an early warning system. Does not receive NOAA channels in a fashion that can be understood indoors. I really don't intend to be outdoors with storms approaching. Radio is marginal, will not receive local station which is 1.5 miles from home, however a station 20 miles away comes in fairly well. Not much help when your trying to get local info. Have not tried FRS/GMRS function but really don't expect much based on performance so far. I like the fact that it has rechargeable batteries as well as the hand crank and the ability to operate from AA's, car adapter or house adapter. Just wish I could receive weather info and some local stations. Don't see much use in the future."
1,Don't waste your money,"After the suggested initial 24 hour charge I turned the radio on an it only played for about 4 hours before the battery was flat. The crank is a joke - 1 minute of vigorous cranking powers the radio for around 30 seconds! Using the hand crank to charge a cell phone would take way to long for it to be a realistic option. Two way radio reception is around 1/3 of a mile if you're lucky. Unfortunately for me I threw the packaging away, so cannot return it, but then again an extra paper weight is always useful :)"
1,Midland Base Camp does not hold a charge,Do not buy. Batteries do not hold a charge. Customer service did not make it right. I sent it back once with this complaint. Postage back at my expense to receive either the same radio or another that also would not hold a charge.
1,Won't charge a smartphone,"I don't know, maybe this is common knowledge with these things. But to me it seems like iPhones and such are popular enough that it would be stated clearly in the product description. This thing won't even begin to charge my iPhone, and the customer service people at Midland told me that this product isn't ""advanced enough"" to charge any smartphone. Wish I had known this, no way to return now and the Midland rep didn't seem at all concerned. Just a warning for those of you who weren't aware.Also, I concur with the reviews questioning the reception. During a recent sleet and ice storm, I couldn't get the weather band to receive unless I stood out in the middle of the road outside my house. Literally, even the porch overhang was enough to preclude reception."
3,It Does What It Says It Will Do,The pros are:It does what it says it will doComes semi chargesThe cons are:It confuses the heck out of me how to program the darn thing
3,Not worth current price,"I paid 61.48 for one of these last February. It works perfectly fine but it is made out of cheap plastic, ten minutes of hand cranking is barely worth the 30 seconds of radio time you get out of it, and the slightest bit of sand put it out of commission for several months. The pros for this radio are that is has four ways to charge (but as I said hand cranking really doesn't cut it) and is a two way communication device. It does generally pick up the NOAA weather service pretty well, even in severely stormy areas."
2,"It does a lot of things, none of them well.","It does a lot of things, none of them well.A free Harbor Freight flashlight is brighter.The weather, AM, FM reception and sound is toy like.The GMRS may be adequate, but the sound quality is so bad, how would you ever know.It does make a nice looking paper weight on my desk though.And customer service was prompt."
3,"Decent product, but poor build quality.","It is a decent product that has all the features I wanted in a handcrank emergency radio / flashlight / cell phone charger /2-way radio. All of the features seem to work alright. However, the build quality is very poor, especially for an item that is intended to be for emergency / outdoor use. For instance, the retaining clip for the hand mic/speaker broke within a minute of it's being out of the box. It looked like it had been hand glued on, and the glue had been poorly applied. The fit and finish are worse than my $5 no-name handcrank radio/light. I have other Midland 2-way radios and they are much better made than this."
1,DOA,I was so excited to get this emergency radio but it didn't work. Not sure if the item sat too long and it ruined the rechargeable battery or what but I was disappointed when I discovered it would not work. Amazon as usual was great with the ability to return the item.
2,Needed a crank radio.,"Radio is very small, clock stays on can not shut off kills either the batteries or power storage from crank power. Does not power as quickly as advertised. Two minutes of cranking is suppose to be power for one hour not even close. 2 way radio is the best thing about this radio."
4,Midland two-way radio,"Really cool little radio! three different forms of powering it: rechargeable, crank and 4 AA batteries. The only thing that might be an issue is the handle on top, I'm kind of scared that it might break off. But even if if does, there's nothing in there so the radio should work just fine without it."
2,Not plug and play,"Not plug and play at all, so if your not the type of person who like to read instructions you will never get this thing to do all the ad say's it can do."
2,Don't pay too much.,"This radio has been sold in the past for as little as $45. You can purchase it from a popular outfitter for $90. It's not a bad device, but its not a worth more than $90."
3,Not bad but not good,Good features worked good but did not have half the range it was rated. I know terain plays in but still did come close.
5,"Great Radio, Sorry Battery Pack","I purchased this radio to use with the Midland GXT1000VP4 radios that I also have. The radio works well with the other radios but does not have quite the transmission range of 2 and 1/4 miles through dense woods. However it does well monitoring other radio traffic/chatter. The battery pack that came with this radio performs poorly. I charged the pack according to instructions but when using it to transmit, the radio automatically cycles down to low transmission power. I installed 4 Sanyo AA Enerloop batteries in the alternate power source provided and have had no problems operating the radio."
2,Crank handle broke after 2nd use,"Everything on it works great! The charging crank handle broke after the second use, although the charger worked great and fast the first time....typical cheap poor quality. If you know you will always have grid/ solar power...it is great."
3,Works but...,"The unit works, but only if you live in a rural & flat area.I purchased the item, thinking that it would be great for emergencies.I could use the FM radio, weather station, light.The AM and other bands nothing but static.The Two way communication, nothing but static.The Amazon advertisement says nothing about the limitations of the communication section. Amazon needs to correct that ad.Otherwise if you live in a flat & rural area, it probably works like a champ."
1,Save your money,"The Midland XT511 Dynamo 22-Channel GMRS Emergency Crank Radio dose not work well and gets poor reception as weather radio, CB and am/fm radio.The very thing it was supposed to do well and the reason I purchased it."
4,"He's Got ""The Look""","Nashville finally has a young star to re-focus the thing that makes Nashville smashville. That thing is Virgin Records new artist Jerry Kilgore! Put a pot of coffee on and play him early in the morning and you can thank God in heaven that Scott Hendricks produces country music. Jerry cuts songs that make the old faded and jaded Nashville studio musicians remember how it feels to get all excited again. There are 12 songs on this ""Love Trip"" recording but I personally claim ""Dangerous""...and ""Don't Tell Me""....as my goodest ones and I'll fight you if you try to take them."
3,good,"many presentations and little music, a lot of script but the performances are good, I love Celtic music, thank you very much"
5,The Celts: Christmas With the Celts,"Caught a portion of this on TV and was so impressed I bought the DVD. It is excellent, and well worth the viewing. Now one of my favorites."
1,"Yep, the first reviewer is correct.",This cravat is a piece of crap. I just needed something decent-looking for a Halloween costume and this over-priced piece of plastic is not going to work. Highly recommend you look elsewhere!
5,Nice tie - perfect for dracula costume,Bought this for Halloween for a costume party we throw every year at our home. This was perfect and really fantastic for the price I paid. Came in a clear bag - no assembly required - just adjust to your neck size and you're done! Great product
2,Stinky toy,"I am disappointed in this toy in many ways. It does stink, not something you want around, especially when it is brought into the car. It doesn't clean as well as it advertises and is a toy that is tossed aside after a few minutes of play. Don't waste your money on this toy."
4,silly fun,"my 7 year old son has a blast with this monster. He enjoys writing his name or just drawing designs on it. It may not be the prettiest thing around, but he thinks it is a riot. We just toss it in the wash and really have no problems getting it clean. I do wish it came with more markers, however he uses pretty much any marker he can get his hands on and the only one that really doesn't wash out is my sharpie (no big surprise). Overall it is a good value. It doesn't cost a fortune but does bring out his creative side."
4,Just what I was looking for,"These speakers were exactly what I expected and needed. So, why did I give them a 4 instead of a 5? I reserve 5 for products that exceed my expectations. Recomendations for rev.2: Add an audio out jack. I would have loved to use this to interface my phone to my stereo at home, and the speakers when away."
4,Unique and works,Its pretty good. Saved my life when my radio broke in my car. One of the volume buttons doesn't click right.
1,Customer support,"Tried four times to get customer support no one ever did respond! Then I returned it, maybe I could have liked it!"
2,Speed Nap,"For a short rest only. Brings listener toward brink of sleep then just before you get there, it guides you wide awake again."
4,Speed Sleep II,"This product worked for me, probably because I once used a hypnotist to lose weight. Imagery is good, if you can relax enough to let it spin without conscious thought. My only problem is that I wanted this to get to sleep for the whole night, and the return was about 60 minutes. Still, I rested very well, and fell asleep a short time later."
1,Speed Sleep II : For Health & Fitness,The CD does not help in falling asleep. I don't see what other benefits it might have.
2,Wishful thinking accounts for something,The plecebo effect probably accounts for what little benefit I perceive to have gained from using this product.
2,Not what I expected,"I was dazzled by the claim that it is 230 minutes long; however, that includes the movie, ""A Hometown Story"", one of her first, she only appears for about 2 minutes. An interesting aspect is the biography is the black and white 1964 done about her. So it was entertaining to watch, but it was just a basic overview of her life."
3,typo,"I loved this dvd, the only thing that threw me off was the title on the cover ""Marilym monroe""Gave a cheap feel to a good dvd. if not for the typo I would have given 5 stars..."
3,Adequate basic starting set for kids,This package has a telescope and a microscope in it. The telescope is adequate for a first set for your kids (6-10 yrs) but the stand included in the set is a small one only useful for setting it down on a table or other high surface. Unfortunately the telescopes stand attachment is not a standard one so you cannot use with a stand you may have for you camera or camcorder. Focusing the telescope is hard and expect to help your kid with it everytime. The microscope is easier to use however the lightbulb on my unit burned out within a day. I do not think it is replacable.
2,Usually like these types of toys....but,"I was real disappointed with this product. I usually like toys that allow children to grow things and I felt this would be a real good learning experience. However....out of the 20+ seeds that we tried planting, only 2 actually sprouted. The directions say to plant them 1/4 inch from the viewing window. We did this the first time and when it sprouted, we were unable to see the root! I recommend planting the seeds right next to the viewing window and planting a few more than the 3-4 seeds per hole that they say in the instructions. (Or try a different product...The Wee Enchanted Garden is Great!)"
2,Disappointed.,"I had really high expectations for this toy and am sad to say that I'm disappointed. First of all, the soil and the water reservoir mold and are stinky. I also don't like how it's made of styrofoam and bulky. It's been over a 6 weeks since we've planted radishes and you can't see anything beneath the soil (the plants are there). I just think the design really needs some work. I would not recommend this toy as it is. The picture on the box is very deceiving, particularly since you are to plant only 1 veggie at that time - those are obviously plastic vegetables to make it look great. Not worth it in my opinion."
2,A little disappointed,"The actual product is kind of cheap for the price. It's just styrofoam. We tried planting two different veggies, and had no success. Perhaps our environment was right? But we got a few sprouts that just withered away. It was overall disappointing and took up space for 6 months."
2,disappointed,"I was excited to get this for my 6 year old daughter who loves plants and science. We were excited to plant the seeds and followed the directions to a t. The construction was very cheap (styrofoam!) but I was willing to overlook that if it worked. Well, the seeds sprouted just like we expected. But after that the plants just died and my daughter was very disappointed. We tried it in a few locations to vary the light, etc. and nothing worked. I'm going to try some more seeds one more time, but I regret purchasing this."
2,not very happy,I was not very happy when I received this package I bought for a gift. it came without the box shown in the picture. arrived in just a plain shipping box. I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. the pictured box would have explained what was inside instead it just looked like a piece of Styrofoam to her
3,Just Okay,Good idea just didn't work for us. Plants died soon after they sprouted and excessive mold over each of the rope wicks.
1,Witherfull,"This product is not worth the time or money. Received this as a birthday gift for my 3 year old son. I agree that the intention is nice. However, once the carrots and radishes sprouted as suggested within the week, they withered away. The onions never even sprouted. The dirt grew moldy as did we sitting there waiting for such magic to happen. There is no wow factor in this experiment making vegetables appear like they are from a magic garden. We saw one root barely making its way forward to the viewing window. My child lost interest as did I and now we are contemplating re-planting seeds again. Save yourself the money and just buy your own seeds and plant them in a pot. Wanted to teach my son the patience of waiting for something to happen and see how nature grows, but instead I think that lesson withered away. Tried to contact the company directly but I got a voice mail recording and no phone call back. That says something about the company."
4,ROOT-VUE-FARM,MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT SHE IS ALWAZ TRYING TO GROW DIFFERENT THINGS SO THIS GAVE HER A CHANCH TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER THE DIRT.Root-Vue Farm
1,Styrofoam???,"I think this is a great idea. Let's teach children the importance of good healthy food, how it grows, how growing our own food can be rewarding and fun! It's truly a miracle what dirt, water and a seed can do. Our planet is amazing. But while we are at it, let us also teach our children how to be respectful of this planet that we are all systematically destroying. How can we teach this by having them grow something in a container made out of styrofoam? Polystyrene plastic will not breakdown in the environment even after 1000 years. It's petroleum based and no organism on earth eats petro based products, which means it won't break down and that these little ""natural gardens"" will be around polluting our planet for several millennium. Shame on you HSP ""Nature Toys"""
4,To Herb or Not To Herb.....That is the question.,"I just bought this book (6/2004) and finished scanning it, as well as looking up some information for a patient of mine. Even though this book was published 4 years ago, it is still very up-to-date, with the exception of reference to HRT, which train of thought was dramatically changed after the WHI study results! This book is easy to read and has at-a-glance reference to help deal with those hard-to-answer herbal questions patients always manage to hit me with. I like the fact that it is evidence-based and cites sound research, as well as questioning biased study results. Provides information on some herbs that I had a hard time locating reliable information about on the internet. Not the end-all-be-all book on herbal supplements, but truly worth having on the reference shelf!"
4,A nice first person look into NM history,This book tells the history of the lives of people living on the Staked Plains of New Mexico and their way of life through personal stories and research.
4,Chasing Gray,"I think this CD is really great. I enjoy all the songs but in particular my favorites were before, candle, overtaking, someplace closer, at all, and better now. I love the vocals and they just kind of flow and you dont know it until the song ends. My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that sleepin in saturdays isnt on this cd. that is my personal favorite by the band. other similar bands i like are guster, burlap to cashmere, dispatch, dovetail joint, athenaeum, papas fritas, and moe."
1,You get what you pay for,"Well, the old adage about getting what you pay for is true. These and the 60 Watt bulbs are pretty poor. We've had two so far that have lasted a day --- yep, a day. They also have different brightness levels, we changed one filed 75 Watt bulb with another 75 Watt bulb and it had the brightness of a 40 Watt bulb!When these are all gone, no more. And at the rate they are failing that won't take long."
2,"Great photos, terrible technical data","While this book does have a suprising number of photos that are not usually found in other publications, the technical data is rife with errors, even to the point of contradicting itself from one page, or even paragraph, to the next. Great for pictures, but don't buy this if you are looking for any new nuggets of information (or even to attempt to corraborate any ones you might have in other publications). I'm not sure if the problem was shoddy research, or poor editing, or a combination of the two."
4,Good basic product,Pleased with quality of items.Tired of going out to the shop to get these tools from my shop. They are together in the roll pack. Very satisfied for what i paid. Would buy again.
1,"Defective product, no support","Defective product - The DDV3120 cannot keep time unless a tape is in the second deck, but it is not mentioned in the owner's manual, you have to check the web site. This is a documented (online only) problem with no solution. I have tried for five months to register online or talk with tech support to register. The online registration page has changed, but still does not work. The phone tech support people are polite, but only refer you to the web site. Site surveys don't generate a response."
2,Ho hum,Didn't last very long. Guess I got my money's worth but not much more. Good thing VHS tapes are passe.
5,A great digital camera.,The D-550 Zoom is a great dig. All the features you should ever need unless you intend to be the ultimate professional. The picture quality is wonderful. The only draw back is the instruction booklet. If this is your first dig it will take you a while to discover all that it does and the literature is hard to follow sometimes. I still recommend it over any other camera in this price range.
1,"If you want an Olympus Camera under $500, get the 520.","Not worth the price!I had both, the 520 first, which had some features I was not happy with but I thought the 550 with the 3 MP was the way to improve on it. Definitely not. At night, it looked like there were UFO's behind me. Even when standing perfectly still, lights came out as streaks in the background. Printed pictures were not great and most photos taken were blurry.In the end I got the Sony CyberSHots 71"
5,5-Star Camera* * * * *,"When I first set eyes on this camera I fell in love with the pop-up flash. Not just that the outcome of it's photos are amazing especially on bright sunny days. This camera is a must have for those looking to take there digital photography to a whole new level, 3.0 mega pixels. I use this camera with a HP Photosmart 1315, and they get along well and always provide me with beautiful, vibrant photos. I was very pleased with my first photo which was an 8x10 of my young nefews. This camera is truly amazing but, there are some must have accessories:--RECHARGABLE BATTERIES--LARGER CAPACITY SMART MEDIA CARD, (16MB INCLUDED)**Go ahead, make the purchase & you won't be dissappointed**GUARANTEED"
4,Good but not the excellent,"I'm totally happy with the picture quality for the price i'd paid for it.However, there are some small hitches that users might need to consider before buying this camera1) lens shutter door is flimsy and cumbersome2) software isn't that great and I use MGI photosuite instead3) flash opens up automatically when opening the lens door butdoesn't close automatically4) Ease of use isn't that great."
5,Love this camera,Bought this one from Amazon this year and I have taken hundreds of pictures with it. Have even had some shown on our local TV news show. Easy to use and the pictures are outstanding!!! I LOVE this camera!!!
3,Excessive noise in image under low light conditions,"I shall say that overall this camera performs well. My main complaint is that the pictures taken in low light (with or without flash) tend to have excessive noises, i.e. tiny color dots all over. However, under ample sunlight, the problem does not seem to exist. Also, I noticed that the camera does not produce as sharp pictures as my brother's Nikon digital does. It does not degrade to the extent of defectiveness, but there certainly is more to be desired."
4,"Older Camera, Still Usefull","I bought this to upload pictures on ebay. I have a fairly new Casio camera that is faster and is a 10.1 megapixel, but the file size takes too long to load on ebay. The Olympus has a 3+ megapixel, and the file size is about 1/4 the Casio. These load fine and are good photos. My only complaint is the size. It is about the same height and depth, but the thickness is about four times the size of the Casio. I guess when this was new that was OK, but just something I thought I'd point out.Conclusion: If you need a good basic camera and don't mind the thickness, this is a nice older model that still works well today."
1,Strange Problem,"I received this camera as a birthday gift. The pictures turned out so well and the camera was so easy to use everyone in my family eventually bought one. However, after one year of use the camera started malfunctioning. (Naturally after the warranty expired) Pictures taken indoors in low light were fine. Anything with window light or light from a light fixture became streaky. Additionally, pictures taken outdoors in any kind of sunlight looked completely overexposed. These problems have rendered the camera completely worthless. My brother, who also owns this model as well, is just starting to encounter the same problem. His camera is also approximately one year old."
4,Mel_dude,"Excellent camera for the money. I bough my on amazon.com. Used it during my trip to tampa, fl. Got some great pictures. Does not perrforms fairly in very low light environments. Overall a great buy."
3,Not very bad,"I was thinking of buying a digicam for myself. For a reasonable pricerange - .... My two options were Canon A40 and Olympus D550. After surching digital camera reviews sites for a couple of days I decided to go for Olympus. My neighbor has Canon A40 so I had a chance to compare pictures made with two cameras under similar conditions. Olympus was superior. My surprise came when I transfered a couple of pictures made at night. I see 7 vertical distinctive dark strips on every picture under low light condition! I took another one from Staples - and got same thing! At the same time my sister has same camera bought 7 month ago, and those pictures are OK. I am all confused..."
2,Save your $$$$$,"Photo's are good, but software ain't.I've owned the Camedia 550 for a little over a year. I am very disapointed in the software that you HAVE to use with this camera. I upgraded to the ""professional"" edition, but it's still bad. It does not alow you to back up your photo's onto CD. (Floppy Disk Only, which is worthless). Also I have pixels dying on my viewing screen.It is difficult to manuver through the options on the camera. Also uses a Smart Media Card, which the new ones do not use, and very few new camera do use, so I'll be stuck with $200 bucks worth of Smart Media Cards when I decide to chuck this thing."
3,It Survives,"O.k., I recently purchased this camera and haven't had a chance to really put it through its paces. While vacationing over the New Year's holiday I had unknowingly dropped my new camera in the snow. Luckily, I knew the general area were it probabaly fell out. I found it after searching frantically for about 45 minutes. Dried it off, and ta-da! It worked with the photos I took intact! I'm sold..."
1,Buyer Beware!,"After we had this camera for two weeks, my two year old got a hold of it and from her waist height (about 18"") accidentally dropped it onto our hardwood floor. It cracked the case and therefore, totaled it. I don't think ANYthing dropped from such a short distance to a semi-soft surface should be rendered useless, but it no longer even turns on. Olympus repair refused to service it. Buyers with small children or hazardous lifestyles may wish to steer towards a more ruggedized manufacturer, or at least one who recognizes a faulty design. I'm NEVER buying Olympus again!"
5,Good camera,"We checked out all the other 3 Megapixel cameras and much preferred the Olympus based on price and features. The fact that I have had an 35mm Olympus camera for 20 years and have never had a problem with it also helped make the decision.What's good:1) Picture quality2) Features - preprogrammed modes3) Clear LCD screen4) Nice software included - even though I use PhotoShop for editing, the software doea a good job of organizing the photos.What's Not So good:1) As others have pointed out, the lense cover has to be fully retracted to fire it up - not difficult - but often overlooked.2) No camera case3) Irritating constant pop up of flash, even when not needed.Other than that, make sure you have extra memory cards, and don't even think about using it without rechargeable batteries."
5,Excellent photos,"I purchased the Olympus D-550 from Amazon last year. Since then I have taken plenty of excellent photos with this camera. I haven't looked into adjusting any of the settings- I simply just point and shoot. After returning from trips and sharing photos with friends with different cameras, the photos from the Olympus D-550 have always been of better quality than my friends' pictures. My friends have mostly Canon digital cameras, which are smaller, more popular and trendier, but the quality is nowhere near that of the Olympus D-550. It also takes good photos in low light situations. You do need to buy rechargable batteries with this camera, as the batteries will run down probably after 2 full days of taking pictures. But I think this is a problem with all digital cameras and should be expected. If you are interested in excellent quality photos and are okay with having a camera that is slightly larger than the current Canons on the market, I would highly recommend this camera."
5,Pet shampoo for people with allergies to pet dander.,"The only shampoo for people with allergies to pet danderthat I can find still on the market since Groomax seemsto have gone out of business.It costs about twice as much as Groomax, but sincethat is no longer available, thank you Allersearch forcoming up with a product that is as good or better.We have been using it for about two months now,and it seems to be what we were looking for!we carried this shampoo to our pet groomerto use on our Shih-Tzu, and she liked it enoughto order some for her own dogs!"
1,surprised,"I bought this to use on my two little dogs. The reviews were all good so I splurged. My mom is allergic to them so I thought it would be worth it. Little did I know this stuff STINKS!! It's horrible. I was tempted to wash my dogs with this then use their regular shampoo over it to take away some of the smell. When I visited my mom, she asked me when I washed them last beacause she could barely breathe. She had no idea that I washed them the day before and used this stuff. So if you want to waste you money, this would be a great product to do so!!"
2,Strong medicinal odor,This product does have a strong medicinal odor (think vets office)I am not sure as to whether it works to alleviate allergy symptoms as my meds were upped around the same time as we used the shampoo.
3,"Fun product for kids ""pretend time""","Well, I'm a 20 year old and got this to complement a Halloween costume. The problems that I experienced wouldn't apply to the population that this product was actually made for, which is grade school children.The headband was a little tight and gave me a headache after a couple hours. My waist was far too large for tail attachment, so I had to improvise. For these reasons, I wouldn't suggest getting this for anyone older/bigger than the average sized 11 year old.It's cheaply made, so the sewing is misaligned in some areas, but I doubt kids care about minor production details like that, so for the right age, this would be a fun and adequate costume complement."
2,VHS Appointment in London,"My order came quite fast from Great Britain to the U.S. & the price was right. However I was disappointed that I was not able to play it on my VHS/DVD player here in the states. The VHS is marked ""Universal"" but I don't believe it is."
1,What a Rip-Off!,"Despite the ""On Tour"" title, this is NOT a live album. It is simply a compilation of the classic versions of their hits, released on fifty other albums."
1,Another packing victim,"Yup. That's it for me as well. My 2 figures arrived in record time, but packed short-ways in a long box. Sure....it prevented movement. However, to make this fit, they had to be jammed down and it completely bent the top of the figure packaging. This is the 3rd time I've had figures destroyed by the S&H process. Amazon: This is not a cost issue! There was sufficient packing here....just no care. I'll pay a premium with another vendor or even on the secondary market. Good bye!"
1,And these packaging terrors surprise who???!!,"If TRU.com somehow acquired the exclusive rights to produce all things Star Wars, I would quit collecting Star Wars. I have NEVER ordered anything from TRU.com that did not have to be returned for a replacement. NEVER! After SIX times, there will not be a number seven.I HOPE that you folks learned a lesson and I HOPE that those who are interested in this figure read these reviews. There is only ONE way to get this unacceptable practice to stop - and that's to stop giving TRU.com our money. If more collectors demand better, we will get better. Until then, get used to it.When in doubt, spend a couple of extra bucks, go to an online retailer or eBay seller you know and trust and get your piece of mind and your collectible figure intact. www.alliancecollectibles.com; www.cloudcitycollectibles.com; and others. They'll do you right.J"
2,Holo-promises,"This yoda ws a big disappointment. I ordered mine from Amazon and it was packed okay, but when I opened it I was disappointed to find that its legs were put on the figure backwards. I went to my local Toys R Us when they got their shipment hoping to get another, but all of them had backwards legs too.Furthermore, there is no peg hole in the bottom of the feet for a peg and yet the figure comes with a stand with a peg. Where's the logic there?By the way, they were selling them for $9.99 at my local Toys R Us - no need to buy the $25 dollars in stuff unless you wanted the Yoda for free."
3,"Nice figure, poorly packed for shipping",This is a nice figure and was purchased to open since I already had one that I got when it first came out. This figure was loose in the box and had received a lot of damaged from shuffling in the box during transit. If I had bought this as a collector I would have returned it for a refund due to the damage but since I bought it to open it really didn't matter.
5,Not even going to take a chance!,"Well,since its going to be 7 days Sunday that they went on ""sale"" in stores and still no sale here,on the site & with all the bad reports on shipping , I just got two on ebay MINT ON MINT CARDS for $11.00 each. I'm happy to pay a buck or so more to get high qty figure on ebay . NO SALE AMAZON.GET WITH IT!"
1,I'm returning mine,"I recieved mine today and was very unhappy, the card was just mangled. I have never had a problem with anything I have ordered before, so this is a first. I hope they have more and will be repacking my new one mor4e carefully."
5,Love it!,What a great video! I have bought several workout videos in the past few years but none of them have motivated me to stick to them until now. I look forward to working out!!!
3,Not for the uncoordinated!,"I tried. I failed. The first 2 minutes of this film had me so, so confused. I had no idea what moves they were referring to or how to do the ones they were showing! I looked for an explanation on the DVD but I couldn't find anything. I'm sure this is great for people with some sort of background in dance, but for me? A very un-danced lady? Just confusing and frustrating."
5,great workout for me,"I love these videos. You can follow the dancers without difficulty and the narration helps too. It is great to be able to do this in the privacy of my home and not care if I stumble or lose my balance at certain points of the exercises :) Besides you definitely get better if you keep at it. Previous experience and knowledge of ballet terminology would help but not a requirement in my opinion. It is a great workout, you feel it the next day!"
4,average for a beginner,"This video is very slow and doesn't explain everything clearly, but overall, I enjoyed it. To a beginner, after a few rounds of the workouts, you will feel comfortable with the sequences and ways of carrying out the exercises. Overall, a good choice for a beginner. However, why they chose Sarah Jessica Parker to promote it, instead of a serious ballet dancer, I will never know."
2,BORING!,"This is okay once...But the monotone instruction, boring music, and slow made me stop several times to do something to get my energy up. BLAH"
5,Balance,Good product to increase your core balance in between professional instruction.Low impact while increasing strength and endurance. Allows time to concentrateon form as you progress.
5,awesome workout!,"Before I went to college, I have taken ballet lessons for 14 years. I didn't have the chance to continue dance while at school and I missed it. I was really excited when I found this DVD set. Let me just say it was CHALLENGING! After a few times through each DVD the exercises got a bit easier but still an awesome workout. If you're a former dancer like me, or just want to improve, buy these DVDs!"
2,Hmmm - not for me,"I read the other reviews and yes, it is a lovely DVD, lots of pretty people and soothing voice over. And yes, if you're a professional dancer then this may be a great DVD for you...however, if you're not and you're looking for a nice workout with ballet focus then this may not be for you. I studied ballet for years and even have a barre in my home, so I'm always looking for a workout that lets me utilize this type of workout. I found this DVD to be a little too slow, too ""arty"" and too advanced for most. If you're just starting out or are just looking for something to add to another workout program then I'd recommend avoiding this DVD and going for a more integrated workout like pilates or callenetics."
3,Too hard!,"I have some ballet experience from when i took classes as a kid, but i still find this DVD somewhat hard to follow. It's also kind of slow. I would rather take classes live, as this was just too boring to last through the entire thing."
1,This video is a downer for my day...,"I generally wake up at 4:30 in the morning to exercise. When I bought this video it was such a dissapointment! The workouts themselves were fine. It reminded me of ballet class. The transitions between each sequence were frusterating. They didn't flow. The lighting was dark and depressing. If they expected me to finish the whole video, then it should have been cheerier. Instead I was in a sour mood for the rest of the day."
3,is ok for wkout young 1s,this is good wkout for young. I can still do it but. But I Think you have to KNOW About more advanceD for PROFESSIONAL. I am retired PROFESSIO0NAL now.so So i think be CARFUL carful care full
4,For the ballet lover,"This is a great workout that is different from anything around now! I took ballet as a child and it bring me right back to it. Makes me forget how strong I was and how hard ballet is!The workout is very good for posture and core strength. I also like that it is slower and give you time to focus on your muscles and positioning.I do not like the format, of the DVD if you just want to do a little bit it is difficult to navigate I end up doing the beginning and then never getting to the end enough.Overall a great hard workout for the ballet lover!"
2,stopping is frustrating,The dvd never plays the whole way through and skips different workouts. How frustrating it is to have to stop and mess with the dvd player every 3 minutes.
4,Great DVD workout,I have recently started taking ballet classes and this video complements them perfectly. It's great because I can choose which areas I want to workout as a complement to a class or simply do the whole program (which is quite demanding). I really like it. The only problem I find is that the explanations to the workout sometimes are not in sync with what the dancers are doing. I simply ignore the voice over and try to do what the dancers do.
5,Improves strength and balance.,"These DVDs are excellent for learning exercises that will improve balance, lower back strength, and abdominal strength. The dance steps increase in complexity, so it takes a little time to be as coordinated as the dancers, but there are enough of the simpler moves to be beneficial."
4,Excellent stretch and strength,"I love these workouts. They are a bit slow but if you follow along it can really work those muscles you do not realize that you have. I think that there could have been a bit of a cardio side that could have been put in, not including the small movements occasionally. I also would appreaciate not having to see SJP every time."
2,Yawn!,I rented this online before I went to buy it. Thank goodness! The music is beautiful and watching the ballerina's graceful moves is nice....but I nearly went to sleep trying to get a workout in. I definitely need something a teensy more fast paced.....not kickboxing fast paced...just not naptime.
5,Great DVD. I love the interviews!,"I am a beginner, although I have had Karate, so have some related training. I am still on the Disk 1, warm-up (part 1), but you can play each section as many times as you need and not go on until you are ready. The video is so beautiful it inspires me to keep working. I love, love, love the interviews which give the ""day in the life of"" each of the 4 (2 men, 2 woman) ballerina's. The interviews show the dedication behind the scene, but also tell the story of four very different lives, from the young to the mother ballerina. It shows them on the streets of New York, where they are eating, streatching, working out and what else they like in there lives. I which there was more. I like watching it while I streatch."
2,Difficult to follow with no counting,"I was really looking forward to doing some ballet in my home, but this dvd is so hard to follow.There are two things that bug me the most. First, is that when the voice over says to go right, he is talking from the point of the dancers. Well I am in my house, looking at the tv and mirroring, so it would be helpful if he said "" left"" , even though the dancers are going right, but in my view left.What is even worse is that there is no counting! I had to slow the video down a lot and do my own counting to see how many steps the ballerinas did during just the warm up. Would "" one two three four"" and "" one two three"" be so hard to say?.Those two points make the video very hard to follow. I'd basically have to memorize the moves, because the ""guide"" voice over is utterly useless.Don't waste your money. Get it from someone who already bought it, or library."
5,Nothing helps my body and technique get bette like this!!,My body and technique have exploded due to this. It's a great substitute for the days you can't make it to class! Must have for any dancer of any age and level!
5,Was a gift,"My sister, just like myself is a dancer. I got this for her for Christmas. Altough we were not formally trained in ballet, alot of the dancing we do requires some ballet conditioning. I would recommend this to people who just need to review the basics. If you are not a dancer, YOU WILL find this boring and tedious. If you are not patient and dont like slow workouts..perhaps this is not for you, but my sister loved it."
1,Not the quality I expected,"This ballet workout DVD was a disappointment. The quality of the production was poor, as were the sequence of workouts. I have the ELEMENT Ballet DVD and was expecting this workout to be similar but more advanced. Instead it was awkward and choppy. There is a title screen between exercises, which breaks up any continuity and the exercises are repetative. I returned this immediately and will stick to my ELEMENT DVD, which I am very happy with."
2,Not what I expected,"Not exactly what I expected for this DVD.There is a lot of down time between the sets, and the sets go fast. I think the arrangement could have been better and easier to follow. Once you memorize the steps it is better. It certainly works your muscles etc. It is very calm and relaxing while you work out. But working out to it is not much fun due to the way it is set up. I tend to use other videos more often than this one."
3,Meh....bit disappointed,"Ive been looking at this DVD off & on for a awhile & finally decided now that Im moving into a toning phase I would check it out.Everyone raves about this workout, I was a bit underwhelmed.I exercise 6-7 days/wk with mix of cardio & strength training. To me this was a light stretching routine. There were parts that required more than light effort but very few. I'm sure my form was not 100% & I could work on tightening abs & not sticking out butt, etc...to make it a bit more challenging.I love ballet, used to be a dancer as a child & still like to shake my groove thang but this wo will only be used on very light exercise days. At that I get a better wo from 20 mins of pilates though...I only tried workout 1 & only once, maybe after repeated use you can notice a difference."
3,Keeps you interested.,This is the first book in the series. The way the ending is makes you want to get the next book in the series so you can find out what happens next.
3,Rose Wilder,"Continues the story of Rose Wilder Lane, Laura Ingalls' daughter, at the turn of the century. Interestingto hear what all the 'new' inventions were at the time and to see what Laura was like as an adult. Rose, however, sounded as if she could be quite a brat!"
5,"Wow, I can't believe I missed this","Gene Eugene was such a fine and wonderful songwriter. It's tragic that he died so young. I love Adam Again and in searching for some of his other work I stumbled across this gem. Windows. What a great song about how God sees through our situations. I mean you really don't find artists writing like this now days. Brendon Heath with Give Me Your Eyes comes close in the concept, but it's hard to capture how God sees through our brokenness the way that Gene does. The whole album is good. I played it through twice today, and I'm getting ready to play it again."
4,Good for Beach Boys fans.,"The first half of this is excellent music. In My Room, Don't Worry Baby, When I Grow Up, Please Let Me Wonder, and obviously Caroline No make for some great music.The second half really falls off though, and it's that second side that may make this a tough call for those wanting to have a complete rock collection. I would recommend this; with Pet Sounds and Greatest Hits 1 obvious inclusions for any collection. Get this and the other 2 I mentioned and you're done w/ the Beach Boys.Half of this is country fair music, but the other half does provide songs in the Pet Sounds vein, and I consider them important to fully capture the essence of what made the Beach Boys a classic band. Most of the good songs draw from Beach Boys Today and Summer Days (And Summer Nights), so if you already have those two, pass this collection up."
2,More Filet Mignon In A Meat Grinder!,"Volume 2 of a horrible series. Capitol shows once again that they do not have a clue as to how to package the Beach Boys. Most of the songs on this CD are the second tier hits but Don't Worry Baby and In My Room are on this, too! Like Volume 1, this collection does not make any sense either chronologically or thematically. The artwork is as horrible as the first CD's. One of these days, they will get it right and give the Beach Boys and their fans something to cheer about. This is not one of those days."
2,disappointed,"It was my fault for not reading the title of the songs. When it said ""Greatest Hits"", I expected to hear the songs I know and sang along with....but nooooooo, there was just a few I could sing to, the others I don't remember hearing before."
1,One hit wonder!!! I need to read more of Amazons description!!!!,"There is only one song that my husband and I know on this CD, but it is the Beach Boys!!! We just play the one song and Vol. I which was terrific. Love it!!!! I am disappointed by Vol II."
5,Great Collection...But You Have To Buy The Other 2 Volumes!,"As the album title indicates, this collection picks up where Volume 1 ends. Although some of the songs barely cracked the Top 40, I feel these songs are just as important and do more than just ""supplement"" Volume 1. Like Volume 1, these songs are short radio versions.The liner notes are enjoyable along with the colorful pictures, song credits and chart positions. As stated in my title, you can't just buy this without getting the other two volumes. Plus, this three volume set may save you from buying their more expensive box set which contains over 100 songs. With this three volume, three CD set, you get 60 songs you will want. Highly recommended."
4,"Great, but...","As usual, it's great, beautiful harmonies, but very well-known... What about issuing some unreleased gems that a lot of hard core fans are dying to hear well mastered?... And what about the 70's albums?"
4,Give it a try!,"I'd previously purchased another CD from him for weight-loss, and while the effects were limited did find the CD relaxing. So when my anxiety returned after years of living fairly free of it I decided to give this one a try.I'm very pleased with the results. After using for less than 2 weeks it has greatly reduced my anxiety. My husband has even caught me preforming the anxiety relieving trigger subconsciously on a few occasions, letting me know that this is working on a deeper level.I definitely recommend this CD."
1,"Dumb blonde, horrible book","I like a good erotica book, but this one was a bad one. From the very fisrt page I thought the female lead was nothing short of dumb. She has a man trying to take advantage of her and the only thing she does is babbling! Oh, and then she runs off to bed with the man that has just saved her and she spents all the sex babbling and complainig that she doesn't know how to do it well as her ex boyfriend always said to her she wasn't so good at it. Can't think of a better way to take the mood off than talking about exes and how she is afraid of her orsgam.I couldn't read much more of the book, when they attacked because they (the bad guys) want her because the main guy wants her... it was more than enough. There even wasn't a chracteritzation of the characters, they were like shades, and in the case of the female lead, a very dumb one.I know this book has a lot of high ratings, but it didn't work for me. Not a book that I would recommend."
4,Great Start By a First Time Author,"Right at the start of reading Mr. Nagele's book, I realized that he was a keen study of human nature - especially his own. I can relate to that. I can relate to much in this book - it mostly made me laugh, but there were parts, especially in his discussions of loneliness and the type of person that just doesn't have it in him to ""market"" themselves to make friends and love interests easily. I identified with the character and felt as if I was experiencing much with him - laughed with him at his mistakes (some are hilarious). Personally, I think the book was wonderful through the first three-quarters and although I still enjoyed the end, felt it was a much too ""pat"" and happy ending. Although the ending is ""the stuff that dreams are made of"" it didn't ring as true as the first part of the book. But this is a wonderful first effort from a very promising author. I look forward to reading much more from this Mr. Nagele in the future!"
1,Screen Protector Scratches the Screen,"I liked this case, but didn't understand the landing pegs for the screen protector. In the user guide, it looked as though the pegs were face down on top of the Nano. This was a BAD IDEA!!! I have had the case less than 24 hours and now there are more scratches on the screen than before I got this case. I have a White 4GB Nano. I have since flipped the screen upside down so the pegs don't touch the Nano, but now the protector is too close to the screen and rainbow discoloring shows up. The pegs are pretty pointless other than to scratch your screen. Someone needs to make a hard case that has a click wheel protector. So far, Agent 18.com's Shield 4 Nano is the best. I would advise against the zCover due to the poor design of the screen protector. 2 Bad cases do NOT equal 1 good purchase."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,I do not understand how you can scratch your screen as the below review says. I can tell you that I have been using it for a couple of months and it is great! If you have an Ipod Nano there is no better product to protect your precious player. I recommend it hands-down.
3,AAARGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Worst sound quality possible, which is a real tragedy because this contains a rip roaring version of Jambalaya."
1,misadvertised,"this item DOES NOT fit standard 6 "" stovepipe. the total cost was $ 10.99 w/ shipping, but the seller wants $ 8.99to return the item. Their refund policy is ridiculous. I do not recommend this seller!"
4,Great Listening,"This is a great CD, with appeal to many listeners. Some like the slower, easier tracks (No Aphrodisiac by The Whitlams), some like the heavy stuff (The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson). Whatever your taste in music, you're sure to find something to please!"
4,Gamera,"A lot of folks tend to think Gamera is a Godzilla rip-off. While he really was at first, he really carved out a niche for himself as a kid-friendly monster whose films were accessible to a much younger audience than the Big G's were.The early music from the Gamera films is pretty intense. Some of the later stuff is a little too cutesy for my taste (but it makes sense considering that these films were aimed at a considerably younger audience).But if you are an kaiju otaku or at least grew up watching a different monster movie on Saturday afternoons when you were growing up, then this set is a must for your collection."
4,A Gifted Voice,"Brenda Holloway is a true example of classic soul. She was the first West Coast artist on Motown. She was also one of the most under-rated artists on the label. With hits like ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" and ""When I'm Gone"", you wonder why she had only one Tamla/Motown album. Not only is she gifted with singing,but she can also play instruments as well as she can write songs This CD is a must-have for all those who also love classic Motown. My all-time favorite is a tune which she and Mr. Berry Gordy collaborted on writing the composition ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"". This song should have gone to #1 on the charts. The song would eventually be re-made by Blood, Sweat & Tears. Brenda Holloway is pure soul."
1,gave my child nightmares,"Although the book is cute, as are the other Carl books, the content turned out to be very scary to my 15 month child. She got very disturbed every time she saw the picture of the teacher being locked out of the room, and would wake up screaming every night after reading the book. Caregivers are an extremely important part of a young child's ability to feel safe and confident. Seeing the teacher struggling with the door lock does not help a child feel secure."
3,confusing storyline,My son and I found this book to be less satisfying than other books about Carl (my son's favorite dog! :)The storyline is confusing and there are too many unnecessary details in the pictures. It looks like Alexandra Day switched to watercolors in this book and that was not a good change because pictures are not clear now.
4,Good children's book,"My 3 year old daughter loves the Carl series. While she didn't enjoy this as much as ""Carl goes shopping"" she still reads it all the time. The books have very little dialog and let the child figure out the story for themselves.There are also many new things for the child to discover in the illustrations each time they read the book. I highly recommend this series!"
2,tori where are you?,Being a big Tori fan I have to say this cd is a disappointment. I have only been able to listen to it once and even that was painful.
3,As uneven as a volcano....,"It is heartbreaking to hear Tori mumble her way through one of her most engaging songs (""80's"") and give cd-space to a laundry list of plants and such (""Daptura""). Cast lyrics aside, and I'll agree that the music is interesting, but I expect more than pseudo-electronic/new-age-ambient tunes from a Tori Amos album. There are moments of distinction such as ""Concertina"" and ""1,000 Oceans"" which keeps people coming back for more, and make wonderful sense lyrically. But read the text to ""Bliss,"" the most well-produced, listenable song on the album, and one is brought to the brink of revulsion.""Venus"" borders on complete sophistry. There is a fine line between challenging your fans and taking them for granted. ""Venus"" feels rushed & uneven, like an incomplete research project. Bottom line: I think a little more effort in the studio would have been prudent, mostly in terms of vocals. Tori's radically devoted fan base deserves at the very least a top-quality product."
4,"Mediocre album, magnificent live tracks","As one of those Tori fans who feel that none of her later CD's even come close to what she has done in Little Earthquakes, I wasn't too pleased with To Venus and Back. The album tracks have little semblance to her earlier works and don't even get me started on her lyrics. Luckily, the live CD redeems this set. If anything, get TVAB for 1000 Oceans and the live tracks."
2,The Tori I love is dead...,"While I must say I enjoyed portions of cd 1, it was overall a disappointment of major proportions. Tori's beautifully haunting voice is the reason I like her.. and all this electronic garbage is masking it. It hurts me to see the direction Tori is heading.. especially since it seems doubtful she will revert back to her piano. IMO, the live CD is the only reason for buying this set."
1,Nothing New,"Amos has been repeating herself over and over for the past several years. ""Little Earthquakes"" was stunning, ""Under The Pink"" compelling, but everything since then has shown she has long since run out of new ideas. ho-hum."
4,fantastic,"One of her most under-rated albums, for sure. Has delicious electronic washes over delicate piano. First disc only has a single miss: Datura. The rest of the first disc is incredible. Bliss, Josephine, Lust and 1000 Oceans make this album for me. The second disc is just as good, with fantastic live versions of some of my favourite songs."
3,"Live is lovely, studio is not","Tori Amos is a talented artist, but her latest studio CD lacks the powerful emotions that haave carried her other efforts. The songs presented on the studio disc seem overly polished and fake, with the execption of the lovely ""1000 Oceans,"" which brings me to the verge of tears, and ""Suede"", the only song for which her new sound seems to work.The live CD, however, is a different story. The next best thing to seeing Tori in concert. Once you've listened to the live version of ""Cornflake Girl,"" you won't be able to listen to the studio version. Equally good are ""Little Earthquakes,"" ""Waitress,"" ""Sugar,"" ""Cruel,"" and ""Girl."" And the other gem? ""Precious Things"" shines through as excellent."
2,Disappointed...,"I consider myself to be a great Tori fan, but this CD (Venus orbiting) didn't persuade me. I have it for 4 months now and still don't see strong poitns in it. Where has the girl with a piano gone? ""Little Earthquakes"" times? Can't bring myself to write anything more..."
3,*sigh*,"Well, as a major fan of Tori Amos, I was very disappointed...I was hoping that she would return to the ""Little Earthquakes"" (or hope beyond all hopes the Y Kan't Tori Read) style of music. On about only 2 or 3 songs, you can really hear her playing the piano. It seems she has given the music making to other people that have nifty-neto machines that go ""bing"". Another reason why I'm giving this album a 3 is b/c it seems to be missing something, and that's why they descided to add the live album. I consider this cd a step down from ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"". She was getting better, but now it seems as if she's doing too much in too little amount of time. She should have waited another year or two, worked more on the album (maybe added a song or two), and then released it...with the live album not included. Maybe there's hope for the songs included on the singles that will be released for this album."
5,tired of top 40 boy bands and britney spears?,"where did the true music go? well i have been a Tori fan for quite a while. I can tell you this is where its at. This review is for the people who are new to Tori.(If your familiar w/ her previous work and are a fan of hers, you're going to like it!)The key to any of her CD's:don't write them off after the first listening. Her musical styling is complex and her lyrics undefinable. Concern yourself with the feeling you get from listening. I recommend the songs ""Josephine"" ""Bliss"" and ""suede"" as the high points of the album. However its not like the others are very far behind at all. The live album is fabulous.."
4,Tori Amos Rules !,"This double CD compilation has been appropriately titled so because it goes thru her new songs and then goes back to memory lane on her old classics such as Cornflake girl, Winter, Cruel, etc. Initially, I thought that CD2 would feature her MTV unplugged performance which I found captivating. She was simply one of the most talented live performers I've witnessed sing live unplugged, beating the piano as she sings ""Caught A Lite Sneeze""(wow). More Power to our Faerie Queen!"
4,Not much old Tori here!,"If you like Choirgirl Hotel, then you'll like this. It's not like Little Earthquakes or Under the Pink, or even Boys for Pele, which is a little out there. I think it's like most of Tori's work, it takes a while for it to grow on you, and when it does you wonder how you ever lived without it. I already like ""Bliss,"" & ""A Thousand Oceans,"" and i'm hoping that the rest grow on me. As for the live album, I don't know others to compare it to, but if you like Tori Amos, you have to like her live!"
3,Who Cut off Tori's Wings?,"I have been an avid fan of tori since Little Eathquakes, and I have been compelled by her lyrics and music, but it came to a great dissappointment to me when I listened to this CD. I miss the old days of an authentic tori and just her piano.In Venus (disc 1), her voice, emotions, piano, and lyrics sound so contained by an electronic band. Tori sonds like she's trapped in a box, and I hope she finds her way out."
4,"Not the best, but not to be missed!","Thia Cd has live tracks along with recorded gems. I rarely like live tracks,with the exception of MTV's Unplugged. Tori's best cuts are; Bliss, Glory of the 80's,Lust, Josephine, Spring haze & 1,000 Oceans.If you are Her devoted fan, please purchase this Cd. She still sings the songsthat make the soul soar!"
3,Tori Amos--pop star,"This album is even more techno driven than Choirgirl, and less and less like the old piano girl. I love it when Tori experiments, but her beautiful piano has been almost completely lost on this studio album. She sounds less like the extremely talented musician she is, and more like your typical pop star. The live album, however, is great, couldn't ask for more. I especially liked her rendition of Bells for her, but the other songs are excellent too."
5,Well worth the trip,"If you have been a Tori fan since Little Earthquakes and have bought and listened to her work as it has come out, rather than jumping around from release to release, you have been on the same trip Tori has been on. You have evolved with her from LE to BFP to Venus and you understand the linkages and the similarities and you appreciate the nuances and the new-ness she always provides. You are often surprised but never disappointed. This is an amazing album in the tradition of Tori - ever outstanding, never the same thing twice."
4,It's growing on me,"The first time I listened to Venus Orbiting, I thought it was pretty horrible. Unlike a lot of long-time Tori fans, I have nothing against Tori's 'new' sound. Sure I miss the piano, but my grudge against this album is that too many of the songs are VERY boring. In fact, I think 'Glory of the 80s' and 'Suede' are by far the best tracks here...and they're both pretty much piano-independent. Actually, it's the most 'Toriish' songs--Concertina, Lust--that I really don't like. My favorite Tori songs have always been edgy and fierce, even when it's just her and her piano. But these songs are just plain boring. Riot Poof and Datura are nothing fantastic either, but at least I can tell that Tori had a pulse when she recorded them! I will always love Tori and long to hear new music from her, but I really hope she takes a nice long break before her next album.By the way, Venus Live is fantastic, of course."
5,the trip to venus is worth it!,"Tori has a strange way of remaining mysterious, but at the same time overly self expressive. I think that 'To Venus and Back' fits that description as well. Even though it's probably impossible to get the lyrics at a first, after awhile, they make sense and fit,and the message comes through. it's like enlightenment! the result is amazing! I think that Tori is just expanding her base as an artist in this album. the beauty of her voice and piano combined with the abstract lyrics end up as Art and Beauty at it's best. If anything she is making her fans think, and hopefully expand with her, because no matter what kind of album she puts out musically, she always has her heart splattered everywhere in her music.and that's all that matters!!!"
2,"Well, the live tracks are good.","The new studio tracks, for the most part, suck. Now, I'm not a technophobe-I didn't start listening to Tori until ""Choirgirl Hotel"" and it's the album that sucked me in. The problem with TVaB is that often you can't even hear Tori's voice. And the piano is really what makes Tori original and unique. I do like ""Glory of the 80s"" for the lyrics than anything else, ""Lust,"" and particularly ""Josephine."" Nice to hear Tori sing about someone other than herself. (I do like autobiographic songs, but must she start *every* song she writes with the word ""I?"")However, ""Datura,"" ""Riot Poof"" and the like suck. And ""1000 Oceans"" would work better as an 8th grade graduation theme song.However, the live tracks are amazing, especially ""Little Earthquakes,"" ""Girl"" and ""Sugar."""
5,A great CD,"This CD is in keeping with much of Tori's past albums. Not only does the new CD provide new songs to relax to, but the live CD allows for a whole new aspect of her music I've never seen. I've listened to both the CDs at least 50 times through each, and I have yet to tire of them. The live CD never gets old, no matter how many times I listen to it"
4,Better get used to it,"I have been, like most, a Tori fan since ""Little Earthquakes."" Since then she has gradually drifted away from the ""girl and her piano"" style that everyone keeps talking about. This effort, I think, is better than her previous attempts to break from that image. She has a stellar band, excellent production, and great songs (mostly). 1000 Oceans, Glory..., Concertina, and Lust are Tori Classics. Tori fans have to resign to the fact that the good old days are over, and there will never be another Little Earthquakes. Tori has changed, and to that fact there are advantages and drawbacks. This CD is wonderful because we get a peek into the future and glimpse of the past (the exceptional live CD). If you are a fan, buy it. BE PREPARED FOR IT TO BE DIFFERENT, and you will like it just fine."
1,A HUGE disappointment!!,"As a long-time fan of Tori's music, it is sad to say that this the WORST album that Tori has put out to date. Not only are the songs redundant and uninspired, but they also lack the depth, both musically and lyrically, of her other releases. She seems to hide this fact behind over produced beats, and screaming '80's guitar. The emphasis has shifted from beautiful vocals and haunting melodies to standard issue pop. The live cd does much of the same; taking once beautiful songs, and perverting them into pop-rock anthems. Save your money kids - wait until the Tori that we all know and love comes back around to making quality music."
1,Not impressed,"Tori, for me, is a punchy act to follow. Not until ""Under the Pink"" was I a follower. Her albums (with the exception of ""Little Earthquakes"") were all real good up until ""Venus"". I won't include the live material here. I thought the studio album left much to be desired. I was bored."
1,Just getting more and more horrible with every album,"Dude, what a joke. I can't even listen to this stuff anymore. When ""Little Earthquakes"" came out, it was stellar-- one of the best albums of the '90s. ""Under the Pink"" was pretty damn good, too, and I even liked ""Boys for Pele"" (musically). ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" was just a complete disappointment. (Can someone please explain what Tori was thinking with ""Raspberry Swirl""?) I'm to the point where I can't even look at Tori Amos because she's so embarrassingly awful, let alone get through this entire record. And she's like 40 now, too, which doesn't help. She acts like a junkie, and looks like hell. Where has the talented, young, and most importantly, coherent, Tori gone? These lyrics don't even make sense! I've had it."
5,Steady as it comes- Bliss of another kind.,"She's done it again. Yes, perhaps it's not what some EWF expected but, none the less magical. It became clear with From The Choirgirl Hotel that our Tori was taking chances and mulling a new path- she continues on that path with TVAB. Not in the least bit dissapointing, this double album is strong all the way through. Opening with Bliss, you know from the get go that you're in for another one of Tori's rides. And it's well worth it."
4,A half and half album,"While working on a live album, Tori was blessed with new songs. Instead of dropping the live album concept, Tori decided to both release an album of new songs and work the live album into it. The result is this album.This album doesn't quite reach success on either count. The studio portion of the album almost feels rushed, and could have used some polishing. The live disc is almost spectacular, but attempting to limit Tori's 1998 tour to a single disc is disappointing. While giving us many goodies (such as the live version of ""Girl"", a song that Tori has only done in concert a handful of times), there was much that is missing -- such as a Plugged version of any track from her third solo album, Boys for Pele."
2,Buy it for the live CD,"I'll keep this short and sweet.The only reason to buy this cd is for the live performances. The new material feels hollow and manufactured.If you're new to Tori, spend your $15 on one of her earlier works. You'll get much more for your money."
3,If she'd only released the live disc I'd have given it a 5,"First the live disc: Amazing. Better than when I heard her in concert because I'm hearing it through a mic on stage rather than at the back of a bad venue. I especially loved Cooling, Cruel, Mr. Zebra, and Precious Things.The studio disc: I like Bliss and 1,000 Oceans. The rest just runs together in my mind to the point where I really see no virtue in it. If she would have released 2 or 3 new songs on there and a bunch of old B-Sides (Merman! Please, Tori, release Merman!) I'd have been pleased. But this disc really didn't stand out in my mind. This disc may very well be from Venus, but Venus is the most hellish planet in the solar system.Still, I recommend that any Tori fan buy it if for no other reason than the live disc."
4,"Back to Tori with ""Venus""","I didn't have to think twice before buying Tori Amos' new CD. She's an amazing artist and I would probably listen to her reading the phone book. Here we have another batch of strange and sonorous songs on disc one and an unconventional live album composed mainly of lesser known songs and B-sides on disc two. I don't care what people say about her ""self-important ambition""; there's nothing else like her."
5,wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,"TORI HAS DONE IT ONCE AGAIN... HER TALENT IS PROVEN. FIRST THE NEW SONGS ARE DEEP, INCREDIBLE AND SMART, SECOND HER LIVE PERFORMANCES ARE AWASOME, YOU JUST NEED CANDLES, A COLD ROOM AND A CARPET TO JUST LAY DOWN AND FLY........"
3,Excellent live release,"I saw Tori Live a few weeks ago and loved the new song ""Bliss"". When I put her new (disk 1) songs into the player I had incredible high hopes. Unfortunately her new songs don't have anything that differentiates themselves from each other. It almost blended into one hour long sound-scape. The second live release of older songs is everything you could wish for. It strikes an emotional chord, and if you close your eyes.. you can almost believe you are sitting in the theater with this wonderful girl and her piano. I hope in the future, she will lean less on the synthetic music and band.. and more on her beautiful voice and piano."
3,Acceptable.,"As a fan of Tori, I'm kind of neutral about this album. There is some strong material here, but some very mediocre stuff as well. ""1000 Oceans"" sounds as if it could easily become as sonically dull as Choirgirl's ""Jackie's Strength"" after a few listens. The first half of ""Datura"" is almost worthy, but is spoiled by repetitive, boring sequences in the last 4 minutes or so of the song. On the positive side, ""Spring Haze"" is an excellent song and ""Suede"" is as well. ""Bliss"" is a better-than-average Tori song aside from having dumb lyrics. The rest of the tracks on the studio disc don't really move me either way at this point (I've only listened to the full album once as of writing this.) The live stuff is of superb quality, of course. Even some songs that I'm not too fond of she does very well live...Any Tori Amos fan ought to strongly consider buying this album for the live disc, but don't expect too much out of the studio disc."
5,Toris makes magic again,"It sometimes seems impossible that this woman could continue to produce beautiful music again and again, yet she seems to do it effortlessly. Tori has long been criticized for her abstract and hard to comprehend lyrics.However, Tori's music has been a hand to hold for the last 10 years, and far from being hard to dechipher, her joyful/meloncholy/mystical/ faithful/mysterious/ardent songs have been a flashlight in the dark for me, and thousands of other ""ears with feet"".This album only further re-inforces my belief in her genius, and the live disc illustrates to all the doubtful the intimacy and magic that can only be experianced as she writhes on that piano.Tori - thank you for making another freakishly wonderful album, and satisfying all of us who apprecitae you for all that you say about who we are, emotions the most articulate have trouble expressing."
3,"One step back, one step forward...","We were promised a live CD that showed off the highlights ofher Plugged tour. We got that...CD2 is a magical tour de force ofAmos' quirks and melodies. She even plays my perennial favourite Cloud On My Tongue. BUT the studio album that she hadn't thought about until compiling the live set is a real disappointment that sounds rushed. Complex structures and trademark Tori-isms will no longer suffice without quality tunes. Listen to Little Earthquakes or Under The Pink and then stick this on. What's happened? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for change and development. The best songs on From The Choirgirl Hotel were the more experimental tracks, but here it all sounds samey. The overproduced Bliss, Glory of the 80s and the godawful 1000 Oceans could be recorded by anyone from Stevie Nicks to Celine Dion (maybe even Y Kant Tori Read) and the warped Riot Poof and Datura are dismissable. Obviously a must for Tori obsessives but it's the live CD we'll play most."
4,She gets better....... musically anyway,"this cd left no doubt in my mind that tori was not only talented as a musician, but that her albums were actually improving. The only probblem is that most of the songs have a ""love it or hate it quality"" which may not do the princess of kook any favours as far as reaching new listeners is concerned. Best way to decide to see if this album is for you would be to 'try before you buy', but die hard tori fans will no doubt be pleased none the less"
1,Frauds!!!,"Do not order this until you confirm with seller what you are getting. Many sellers are actually selling the Jewel-Case version as opposed to wood one featured! I got ripped off that way.Music is okay, Bliss is a great song, live album is very good, not Tori's best work otherwise, kind of slow and laborious."
5,Precious Things...,"I love these CD's in every way. Tori Amos splashes through different themes throughout both these discs. She's raw and gets her messages a little more clearly through than she had with Scarlet's Walk.Songs on this album which had stood out were: Bliss (daring and sexy), Concertina (lively and pleasant), Lust (which is just so gentle and wonderful), Riot Proof (cabaret/RaWr!), Spring Haze (wonderful beats and great vocals), Precious Things (always precious), Cornflake Girl (raisin girls...), Space Dog (just wow), Purple People (Tori at her best).Buy it if you like the wonderful weird side of Tori Amos. She sparkles like a gem in this CD, and her music is just as good, and maybe even a little better than the rest of her albums."
5,Tori Amos is such a good singer!!!,"I won this CD by calling into a radio station before it came out. I haven't had a chance to listen to it much, but from what I've heard, it is an extremely good cd. I really like Bliss, and a lot of the songs on the first CD. If you like Tori Amos, get this CD!!!!"
4,I Don't Need to Cry to Enjoy It,"I agree with everyone who says that her diction is getting worse. She could be saying anything in these songs, it feels like sometimes. But the new songs on this album are richly textured, sexy and fun to listen to. Unlike a lot of other people, I was really put off by the silly, frivolous, I'm-still-trying-to-be-a-female-Led-Zeppelin songs on Choir Girl. I was very happy to listen to TVAB and hear the moody, dark Tori that I respond to. As some other reviewers have commented, TVAB seems to have a sense of humor about itself, and I defintely appreciate that. For those of you who long for Little Earthquakes, put it in your CD-player on shuffle with Jewel and Sarah Mcglachlan, read some Sylvia Plath, and continue to bemoan your tragic existences. We've all got to move on sometime, and I'm really enjoying these funky, full-bodied, abstract tunes. Bliss is her best song in a long time."
5,The best tori cd by far!,Very good cd. I was glad to see that Mr. Zebra was on there. Along with many other GRRREAT songs that are so Tori. I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do.
3,Venus Gets Lost In Orbit...,"Ok, being a fan since the start I KNOW Tori and quite frankly, 50 percent of the songs on cd1 should have been bsides on any of her singles. Not even Good Bsides, just filler, extra tracks to accompany your purchase. WORST: 1000 oceans, riot poof, datura (an experimental free form MESS). Glory of the 80s and Bliss sound like no frills pop attempts at the radio.There are some gems on here though: Concertina is sweeet and Spring Haze seems like it wandered off of PINK. SUEDE is Tori at her best with experimentation and Juarez for the same reason, as the percussions make you move.Tori is such an amazing artist, we tend to have high standards for her. With that being said, this album simply felt undriven, and uninspired.the 2nd cd is a live one, its a treat for fans old and new. The best track is definately PRECIOUS THINGS, given the rock sound it truly deserves."
3,Doesn't Venus Have Pianos,"I am one of tori amos' biggest fans. i bought the cd the day it came out and was rather disappointed. the live disc is tori at her best, but the studio songs are weak, emotionless and missing which she is known for: the piano. Tori has much more talent than this, she shouldn't drown her piano out with mainstream guitars. The CD is decent but she's done much better."
5,Make you fly into the sky,"(I already said something about the studio album). The live CD is simply amazing. The performance of the songs live is mesmerizing. It provides you with a constant high that the studio albums can't beacuse the songs have spaces in between and have slow moments and in their way are quiet compared to the live ones. Al the songs are fabulous and they are differently performed, and once you start you can't stop. I especially love 'Space Dog', 'Waitress' (some cult lines like ""so I wanted to kill, this wairess...but I believe in peace, bitch!"" are unique, but Tori always finds new ones) which I really can't describe it's SO completely FANTASTIC and Tori sings her with such passion, I'm sure if I had been there I would have screamed my head off. And it's ten minutes long! ALL OF THE SONGS ARE EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALS, they let Tori more freedom to perform in her own personal ways. God knows we love her so much. THIS CD IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TORI. GET IT"
1,We were also ripped off.,"Lorsay never got back to us after my partner and I ordered this item. It is the stock standard issue NOT the wood special edition. Tried contacting Amazon but they referred us to ""DVD Legacy"". Unfortunately with the to-ing and fro-ing we ran out of time for the Amazon 30 Day Guarantee."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM DVD LEGACY (LORSAY INC),"I ordered the import version of ""To Venus and Back"" from DVD Legacy and received the domestic version. It is a royal pain in the a** to get a refund or return from this company because there is no phone number on the company website or the invoice to talk to someone about the problem and the online return form is frustrating.I do not recommend ordering from this company to anyone. DO NOT GIVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO DVD LEGACY!"
5,Another work of art,"I love this album! There are so many layers on this album that one must listen to it several times to unearth them all. It is brilliant! It is a testament to Tori's ability to be in constant motion, constant ""evolution"" and constant surprise. Her use of language is incredible. With Tori every word is a brick in the foundation. You have to LISTEN not just hear. She is truly gifted.This album is a rollercoaster of fun, sadness, introspectiveness and passion! And CD 2 brings back wonderful memories and shows the power of her stage presence. A MUST!!"
4,Hmm..I wasn't too sure about this one..,"Although I am one of those rabid Tori fans that you hear talk of, I was initially disappointed by this album, and believe me, it pains me to say that! The studio album seems to side-line the two elements of Tori's music that I love best - her voice and her mesmerising piano playing. BUT after a few listens, it's really grown on me, I would still recommend it. As for the live CD..is there anyone better than Tori live? I, personally, don't think so. She's an astonishing, exceptional live performer and 'live. still orbiting.' just proved once again to me that yes, it was worth standing in a muddy field with thousands of sweaty hippies at Glstonbury 97! BUY IT!"
4,"Crystal-clear melodies, good lyrics, and a double-disk!","Tori has a magical ability with both voice and piano that, while sounding good on a studio album, she comes across with such energy, emotion, and zest on a live album that all her 'new stuff' should be recorded live!"
2,Loss of songwriting talent is a hard thing to accept,"The only reason that this isn't a one-star review is because she has a well-chosen track listing for the live 1/2 of this 2 CD set. Other than that, I was thoroughly disappointed with Tori's latest effort. She used to have such a great sense of melody. What happened to that? There's not a hook to be found on TVAB. There's not a song that's lyrically coherent either. I listened to the CD 3 times today, and not one song stuck in my head at all. It's sad, because ""Little Earthquakes"" is still by far my favorite CD ever recorded. Since then, she has been on a slow decline, culminating in her new CD, which, aside from 2 tracks, is THOROUGHLY unlistenable. It's so sad. How the mighty have fallen."
5,she is the voice in the clouds,"i am so glad she listened to her muse again. this album is one of the best ive heard...tori's music paints a landscape in my heart every time i hear it. to venus and back gives a very warm and solid feeling, as if you have returned from a long and epic journey, and you fall into a bed of clouds and look back on it from the sky. i could go on forever, but i suggest you go and get this cd and find out for yourself the feelings she can give you..."
5,Tori's latest - Different yet great,"I would have to say after listening to this CD, it's one that I would describe as one you'll either love or hate. I love her new songs cuz they just fill me with inspiration like some of the songs 'from the choirgirl hotel' did. It did catch me off guard that the piano was notably absent in some songs but the band does well for making up the void. Tori has just completely surprised me and this is one of the CDs that I constantly listen to now."
4,Not the most consistent Tori Amos album,"I am not a huge fan of the first disc of this album. I would say it's her least satisifyig work after 'Strange Little Girls.' However there are some good tracks on it including the catchy 'Bliss' and the weird, electronic 'Suede.' Certains tracks however like 'Riot Poof' and 'Datura' are amongst Tori's most forgettable.The second disc is pretty hit and miss. An overlong version of 'Waitress' is the low point. However the live version of the B side track 'Sugar' is worth buying this album for alone. It contains some of the most beautiful singing I have heard in my life. 'Cooling' and 'Purple People' are also high lights.If you are a big Tori Amos fan it goes without saying this is an essential purchase."
4,Tori is Orbiting...,"This was a very much anticipated album, at least for me it was. The first album entitled 'Venus-Orbiting' contained some of her greatest songs. 'Bliss,' 'Riot Proof,' and 'Spring Haze' are a slight deviation from earlier work but that's what any true artist should be able to do. Tori has done it once again with a very moving and fabulous album of new material. The live album is something that she should consider doing more often. The versions of the songs were touching and riveting and if you've ever seen her live, you can only imagine what they must have been like in person."
4,It was very different,"as a huge fan of tori I was a little disappointed to find that her lastest CD wasn't up to standards! Bliss and lust is great! I have to say my favorite is concertina! It's takes you away! I don't care for 1,000 oceans and glories of the 80's. I just find myself looking for that tori who came up with 'boys for pele' it was by far her best! I still recommand it though but please wait til the price goes down."
2,Great live CD,"Tori continues down the digitized path and away from the what made her great. After somewhat of a letdown with Choirgirl I had high hopes for this album. If not for the live CD in the set, Venus might be a total loss. Disc 1 has a few memorable tracks but overall too much synthetic garbage and not enough piano."
1,What's up with all the reverb and delay?,I have always been a big fan of tori - and I loved Choirgirl Hotel. But the production quality of this album retracts greatly from her performances. The overuse of reverb and delay create more ambiance than is really flattering. This CD sounds awful in the car. Does anyone notice that this album simply doesn't *sound* as good as her previous efforts?
3,Where did the girl with the piano go?,"When I first listened to this CD I cannot deny I was pretty disappointed. Even though Tori Amos is my favorite artist, this CD isn't quite what I expected of it. The CD starts with Bliss, which is a fairly nice song with a Choirgirl sound, but then the songs start getting more and more ""industrialised"" and I just don't like that. The girl is clearly there, but without her piano, what's left of her power? The last 2 songs, Spring Haze and 1000 Oceans gave me the firstt hint to answer my question; the girl and her piano moved to CD 2 (the live CD) because this is pretty great. So... I'd say 2 stars for CD 1 and 4 stars for CD 2, that makes 3 doesn't it? Tori, please go back to your piano...."
1,Tori Gets a Band and. . .,"Tori has been working hard to give us a CD almost every year. Maybe she should slow down. Having been a devouted Tori listener since before ""little Earthquakes"" I was suprised how little ""To Venus and Back"" had to offer. No wonder the CD had to come as part of a two CD set. One CD alone would have been too weak. ""To Venus and Back"" contained little new from the wide world or Tori Amos. Basically, she gave us ""Little Earthquakes"" once again, with a new title. She feigns a deep entinsity that falls short of her previous work."
1,Terrible!,"Esotro es un horrible album. Yo de veras detestar Tori Amos. Ella aparente a recibir una eterno necesidad a gimotear. Por favor, en cambio de esotro basura, escuchar a bueno musica, como Alejandra Guzman."
4,"Tori Goes To Venus, and forgets her beloved Piano","It seems with the birth of electronic music, Tori's once indespensible piano is a thing of the past. Although the piano is there, on such ballads as Josephine, the band, and synth has taken over. One longs for the simplistic views of Little Earthquakes. None the less, a beautiful album worth it for the live CD if not the studio."
4,Well...at least it's not a new Jewel album.,"I know, I know...I love Tori's piano too. But let the girl ""rock out"" a little...before you know it she'll be old and won't be able to do this industrial stuff...and then she'll turn back to her dusty piano...and amaze us again."
2,Not worth the money,"The mounting hardware is pretty small and useless. Also, when I pushed the first pushpin into the board, it went all the way through and I could feel it poke out the back of the board! The entire board just seems to be of subpar quality. You can definitely get more for your money elsewhere."
4,Pretty good for the money,The wheel was slightly out of true. Easily fixed by a few spokes tightenings. Other'n that looks good. Will know more when I test ride the bike.
3,Discontinued Model - no support,"We purchased this ice maker in December 2007. It stopped working a few days ago (November 2008). Comes with a one year warranty - guess what! No longer made, and waring no longer supports it. No parts or repair. Waring is refunding the purchase price to us."
1,Exasperated,"Think twice about buying this product. I've had two in a row out of the box that did not work. Waring customer service is laughable. There is no troubleshooting guide in the manual or for the company. So if anything goes wrong w/ it (other than you not getting crystal clear ice) all they can tell you is take it back to the merchant or ship it back to them (at your expense). And as for customer service, here is what you'll hear if you have a problem: ""I'm very sorry, but there is nothing we can do.""I'd steer clear of this clunker and go w/ another brand. I wish the system had let me award 0 stars."
5,Best Tasty Bite Meal,"This is my favorite Tasty Bite meal out of the 4 I've tried (I'm in the process of trying more). I take this to work a lot with some naan or pita, and rice works well, too. It's like Indian-spiced chili - yum! This is a very hardy and satisfying vegetarian meal. Another reviewer suggested adding kidney beans - I might try that."
3,Very long delivery time.,"I don't understand why I had to wait almost two months to receive this case order. Delicious, easy to prepare item. Best if you add your own additional lentils since there aren't that many in the sauce. The sauce is wonderful and spicy."
4,Excellent flavor,Perfect one portion size. Quick and easy to make. Great source of fiber and protein and low in fat. Great and spicy tasting!!
3,Price on this product is ridiculously expensive!,"This is a great product, but at a price that is ridiculous. Costco was offering this product at 6.99 for a box of 4. That is $1.75 a packet. Why is this vendor selling this same product at over twice the cost, when they probably have half the overhead as Costco. I love the product, but refuse to buy at this price."
3,Tastes like coney sauce.,It's got a good flavor but it tastes nothing like Indian food. It tastes exactly like coney dog sauce.
2,Watery. Salty. Too few lentils.,"Perhaps I got a bad batch. This wasn't at all like the madras lentils enjoyed at Indian restaurants. It was watery, too salty, and there were not many lentils. It was like a watery soup, and not like the picture on the package or like a lentil stew."
5,"Torch Rock, ROCKS","I really enjoy this album. Every single song is a well written story and epitomizes a lost art of song writing. This album is wonderful blend of rock, blues, jazz, folk and a little country thrown it. Dick Wagner (producer, guitarist, and co-composer of every song on ""Torch Rock"") revisits his collaboration with Alice Cooper, ""Only Women Bleed"" and highlights the plight of women and children in Taliban controlled Afghanistan and what is going on in Darfur.I would encourage everyone to buy this album and increase Wensday's fan base. In the words of Alice Cooper, ""Wensday is the other girl next door."""
3,Didn't care for Torch Rock,Wouldn't suggest this Cd to friends and family but if you are into that hippy stuff you will probably like it.
2,Not traditional Tai Chi,"This was more of a choreographed workout than traditional Tai Chi. Many steps to learn and decent amount of space needed. The focused appeared to be centered around the routine rather than the efficacy of the movements and the whole idea of focus that Tai Chi normally emphasizes. You can't stay in the present and watch/feel what your body is doing when you are trying to copy the steps and sort through the confusing instructions. Definitely not for beginners or those who want to do ""true"" Tai Chi."
1,Frustrating,"Why would anyone make an exercise program without multiple perspectives on difficult stances? This DVD is very hard to follow because there is no view of the stances from the rear and rather than the leaders showing mirror poses, they do the regular poses facing the camera. As such, the viewer is always trying to translate the visual image in reverse. Poorly thought out. It's a shame too because the scenery is beautiful and the leaders seem good. But it is too frustrating and too hard to follow like this."
5,Fantastic !,"Hydrocortisone Spray with Aloe for Cats and Dogs is fantastic!! My dog has hot spots from a flea allergy and I had used the product previously, but when I started looking to replace the item, I could not find it for sale anywhere. I figured Amazon might have it, so luckily I found it. I ordered 2 bottles, so I would have a backup. It is easy to put on the dog and instantly stops the itching and her biting. After a couple of days (with 3 treatments daily) there is an amazing difference. I have also used it on my cat with the same results, it's just harder to catch the cat."
1,Awful,"Two thirds of the classes I ordered were delivered broken and the seller never responded to my e-mails. the arms of the glasses all broke at the hinge within a few uses. Overall, the quality is terrible and the customer service was poor."
2,Breaks easily,"The product is cheap, but so was the price. It broke quickly in the hands of my 8-year-old daughter who does not play rough. I bought it as a cheap extra to spy toys I put in her Christmas stocking, so I guess it served its purpose. I don't think I would buy it again, though."
3,It's okay,The work but are a little difficult to use. Your heads needs to be in the exact correct position in order to see whats going on behind you. Fun spy gadget for kids. My kids like it and they are ages 7 and 9.
1,"Disappointed. Work, but...","Out of three pairs, two are broken at the hinges within 1 hour. Duct tape on all corners. Flimsy. Pay a little extra and get some good ones. They are fun."
2,Broke,"These glasses broke the first day out of the box. The arm split apart. Granted, they were for our 6 yr old, but he has lots of toys that don't break this easily."
3,not very durable.,"I bought these for my sons: ages 6 and 9. They thought it was cool how they could see behind them. Now my boys are not rough with there toys so I know its not mishandling but within a few days of owning them, the lens popped out of one of them. I was rather disappointed. But I did pay less than $3 so I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Obtuse study aids and a poorly designed CD Rom,"Big disappointment. I found the directions for just taking his diagnostic test to be obtuse and daunting at best. The CD Rom had many bugs. To be fair, the support service eventually got back to me, but their advice completely missed the point of what my problem was. My worst fears were confirmed when I finally did access the LSAT test on the CD Rom. The screens are poorly designed with too much information crammed into a small space. For example, for the reading section only an inch appears at the bottom of the screen which means you must scroll through when you go back to answer the questions. Imagine trying to read a long passage quickly skimming for facts when you can only see an inch at a time. What were they thinking when they designed that? There are many other examples of user unfriendly screens. Save your money as there is better software for the LSAT out there. Contact me if you would like to hear what I have found."
1,Disappointing,"Would be a good guide for someone wanting to write questions for the LSAT (White divulges all the ways they can obfuscate the same question), but a failure as a a guide to actually answering the questions correctly and getting a high score. One of the biggest weaknesses is lack of explanations for wrong, but plausible answers to the practice tests. Also, the CD is a little buggy, and mediocre once you get it going."
5,This is a great story written very well,"Lots of people have lots to say about this book. Some love or hate the author, some claim to have known the book's heroine and therefore feel a sense of possession over the subject matter. Scr*w the lot of them, I say! This is a great story and it is so very well written. That's all that needs to be said. I mean, a story that can maintain the chatty companionship of Gerard Jones's voice and make you want you to turn each page belies the effort and skill that has gone into the creation of this book. And so what if he has gone to great lengths to publicise it on the internet - more kudos to Gerard, I say. Buy it, read it and make up your own mind - what you won't be is disappointed."
1,A Reader,"This book is the autobiography of a self-centered egocentric who hoped to sell a few more books by weaving Ginny Good's name throughout. Mr. Jones' take on Ginny Good's background is mostly fiction (her name is spelled correctly), which, of course, makes the verity of any part of the rest of the story suspect. Taken overall, the book is an insult to a all around wonderful human being.In Short, Ginny Good is a novel, no more, no less, and not a well written one at that."
5,It comes down to this..,"While checking the reviews for ""Ginny Good"" just ignore the one stars because they don't reflect how good the book is they reflect how some people feel about the author of Ginny good. Lots of people don't like Gerard Jones. Lots of people didn't like John Lennon either and for the same reason. If you want something different than the old ""boy meets girl"" story then buy ""Ginny Good"". It leaves you with a certain feeling you won't be able to shake..and the writing is original. He writes the way somebody would speak to you..no bull. I loved it."
1,Promise not kept,"This is one of those books that looks as though it's going to be good, but after a few pages, the novelty of the writing wears thin. I couldn't continue. If the writing had been better, perhaps I would have been interested in the unfolding events, but the choppy and mannered style focused me on the writing itself. Like acting, writing is good when it is not noticed as trying too hard."
3,A sweet little album from a great musician,"Dave Pegg has to be considered one of the seminal figures of folk-rock, having played with Jethro Tull, Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson, Nick Drake, and more. His lyrical, fluid, tasteful bass and mandolin playing always add class and charm to the proceedings. On this solo record, his folkiness takes center stage with charming results. He's limited as a vocalist, but his musical prowess shines throughout, with numbers ranging from sweet folk songs to snaky Celtic tunes. Among the highlights are an early version of Tull's ""Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow"" and a warm tribute song for Sandy Denny. Fans of Pegg's work with the above musicians will enjoy the character and gentle humor of this recording."
5,schoolhouse rock,"I remember these when I was a child! I was so happy to see these available for my son. Music is entertaining & the stories educational. Another way of learning,entertaining & non-violence. GREAT!"
2,Stay well away from this editon!,"Unfortunately, this appears to be the most current edition. The pagination was way off when I got towards the middle of the book, which greatly hampered my ability to follow along in a class that this book was being used for.I too am a big fan of this book and have really enjoyed other works by this author, but anyone wanting this book would do well to dig up the Aquarian Press version.If publishers are going to be able to survive the decline in the industry, especially in areas as specialized as this book covers, there is no excuse for such shoddy workmanship."
3,Great content---horrible editing.,"First of all I'm a huge fan of this book. I owned and used the original first edition about 15 years ago. It is a POWERFUL book. It really can't be overstated that this is an intense book for self-change if one takes the time to do all the pathworkings to the best of ones abilities.So why only 3 stars? Because this version has atrocious copy editing. Really, it looks like it wasn't edited at all. There are endless typos, and for some reason the author seems to think that just putting commas between complete sentences helps the flow of the book. Please get an editor! The amateur editing only diminishes what is great addition to any serious practitioner of Magick or Western-style Qabalah."
1,The Shining Paths,"I am not questioning Ms.Nowicki's qualifications or understanding Path Works on the Tree of Life but this book is not for the serious student of Kabbalah. Her advice in traveling the paths is a fits for all recipe book suggesting what one has to see by traveling them. Everybody and everything one meets on the paths is jovial, smilingly friendly and most helpful. Traveling the paths supposed to be confronting and discovering one's self. Advancing toward the discovery of one's higher consciousness. Although, there are arch/angels and arch/demons who manifest themselves in the same manner to every traveller the experiences are different for every person in recollecting their previous incarnations. If one is for the touchy-feely, warm and fuzzy fairy tale experience then this book is for him but for one who is ready to confront the fear of darkness and realities of his own soul the advice is not to waste money and time on this book."
5,Awesome book!,"Awesome book, helps you along on your inner journey. The more you put into the techniques described - the more you get out of it.Highly recommended :-D"
1,Very bad attitude towards cats in general,"The author likes only the cats that behave according to her 'rules'. She blames the cats if they develop normal behaviors in reaction to the way they are treated. She expects them to be logical and to be able to 'reason'. When one cat hides much of the time as a result of being mistreated, the author says the cat should be more trusting and willing to take risks because the bad treatment is in the past. This is ridiculous. If you love cats, I don't think you'll like this book."
4,Best bang for the buck!,"I will echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer in stating that these mics are probably the best cheap microphones you can buy for your home recording setup. I bought into the 3 for the price of 1 deal, and couldn't be happier, and this is coming from a musician who previously only used SM57's and SM58's exclusively in my low rent garage studio.I personally haven't used them for vocals, but I have used them for mic'ing electric and acoustic instruments with a high level of success.I'm very impressed."
2,Back Under The Law,"Reading the first six chapters of this book on my Kindle and I was ready to purchase hard copies as giveaways because I thought it was the best treatment of the topic of Biblical grace that I have read. But then I saw the review by ""swalk."" I was gald that I read that review before buying the hard copies of the book. When I got to chapter seven of the book the author began placing the believer back under the moral aspects of the law. The book went from a very Biblical treatment of grace to a very unbiblical treatment of the believer and his relation to the law. I would give the first part of this book on grace a five star rating, and the author's treatment of the believer and the law, a one star rating. Pleae read the above referenced review prior to purchasing and/or reading this book. I have not yet finished the book so I hope the book returns to being a Biblical treatment of the subject."
2,A beginner's book,"- better for beginners. (I may have really enjoyed this book a long time ago. However, for the seasoned Christian, there is little to be learned, with some exceptions.)- find some doctrinal questions still hanging around at the end of the book. (If you accept doctrine of salvation that Mr. Bridges holds, 'ticket to heaven'), you may run into some contradictions. ""What motivating principle will cause a person to live no longer for God but for himself?"" (P81) His answer (grace) is not sufficient if contextualized within the doctrine of getting a 'ticket' to heaven upon at conversion. Nothing precludes the person from drifting backwards."
5,Excellent book on the faithfulness of our Sovereign God,"Jerry Bridges does an excellent job at communicating, teaching and reminding the reader of the faithfulness of our Sovereign God. He who began the work of our salvation will finish it ( our sanctification) and He finished our salvation on the cross."
5,Life transforming,Ive been a growing christian for about 10 years and considered myself well read in classic christian literature. I looked down somewhat on all these new theme books. But this book literally changed my life. He teaches grace by breaking it down and going deeper. A must.
5,Awesome Book!,This book really changed my view of grace and challenged me to really live a life of grace. Jerry Bridges captures the real meaning of grace. This is a must read book! Recommend it to anyone and everyone. Really helps you live a more Christ-centered life!
5,Beautiful Grace!,"Bridges displays grace from God's perspective in a freeing way! Grace (in my opinion) is the most essential factor in the Christian life. As Bridges notes in his book, the same grace that saves us, sancifies us! The more a Christian experiences God's grace, the more liberating his or her life becomes. Jerry Bridges helped me (and is helping me) to understand God's grace and to apply it to my life. There is nothing better than to be refreshed with the infinite grace of God that is freely bestowed to all believers. Jerry Bridges does just this! Read it; and know the grace of our great God and Savior-Jesus Christ."
1,Awful reproduction!,"I just received my order of this poster from popculturegraphics... the image is fuzzy and the colors look washed out. I've been buying movie posters online from various sources -- some originals, some reproductions, and this is by far the worst reproduction I've ever seen. :( I'm sorely disappointed!"
3,Not sure,"two of the books that I purchased indicated on the outside that they were the ""new"" book however after the first few pages the text was the same as the old books. Be careful"
4,Strangely Comforting,"As someone who has already lost her mother, I wasn't sure if I would relate to the stories in this book. Amazingly, some feelings & relationships are universal.This is a wonderful examination of the unique & complex relationships between mothers & their adult daughters. Although I could not relate to every story, I found it strangely comforting to know that others experience the same useless arguments that my mom & I did.All in all, it provides a nice discussion of an intriguing topic."
1,empty dvd box,"I was hoping that when I ordered this movie, Elemental Gelade Vol 5, that I would actually receive the movie inside of the dvd box, instead when I received the order, I opened it and the dvd was not inside, just an empty dvd case! Luckily I didn't pay too much for Just the dvd box of Elemental Gelade otherwise I'd be pissed."
4,How many babies out there like astronomy? Raise your hand...,"This product is in the baby section of Amazon. That doesn't make too much sense to me unless you have a baby prodigy.Regardless, this set of outerspace themed appliques are heavy duty enough to withstand a hearty peeloff from the vinyl backing.No need to baby these babies.The stickers are large and attractive. They look good arranged on the wall next to the ""Uncle Milton's Moon in My Room"". I helped my daughter place them on her wall, otherwise they would all have ended up at the eye level of a pre-schooler. The Space Shuttle is particularly cool and is positioned to make a landing on the Moon. (I know the Apollo flew to the moon but you don't need to get too technical for a child). By the way, the Apollo with attached moon landing gear is in this set of stickers,it just doesn't look as impressive as the Space Shuttle poised to land.Let your child imagine that great Outer Space. It is infinity and beyond!"
2,they could be a lot better,"they are transparent wall stickers, so when you them on a dark background, like the picture in the box, you can hardly see them. It was a real dissaponitment!"
4,Nice representation,"The stick on decals are great because I can take them off without ruining the wall. My son loves them. The only thing I wish was that they were more true to the planets in the solar system. I couldn't tell them apart, and all the colors were basically the same. However, they still give a good effect to the room. I'm glad I bought them."
5,Very Cool!!!,"These were very easy to apply (my four year old helped me), they look great, and they are easy to reposition. They stick well enough that I think my child would have a hard time peeling them off. They don't seem to rip easily. These are really a lot of fun, they're fast, and add a great visual design element to a room for such a reasonable price."
4,"More like ""on Tape"", than ""on Tour""","Just a short review from me on this set (I'm referring to Vol. 1 AND 2) of 'on tour' music by Patsy Cline & Loretta Lynn. If you are fans of either or both you will naturally enjoy this set of CD's/Cassettes. However, don't expect ""Live"" actual on Tour preformances (like I did) all the songs are the often heared studio versions recorded by each artist seperately.I have to give it 4 out of 5 stars simply due to the fact that the cover art on this set makes a potential buyer think that they are purchasing ""live tour music"" not radio versions.Buyer beware... but I do recommend these CD's/cassettes if you are a fan of either singer as it's a cheap way to get hit songs by both artists! I am happy with the choice of songs, and think you will be too......but darn it, it just AINT live, like I was lead to believe!!! :o)"
1,Dead out of the box,"This fan is very cheaply made, and this was evident right out of the box. The plastic cover that goes over the blades was warped and would not stay on... it kept popping off. Once we finally got the cover in place and turned the fan on, the power button got jammed in the ""on"" position and would not come out. I promptly disassembled and repacked the fan and shipped it back for a refund. I ended up purchasing the Lakewood LSF1610BR-BM for roughly the same price and it turned out to be of a much better quality than this piece of junk."
2,Fan,"I think this fan sucks. It is very flimsy and makes alot of noise. The cover does not attach well, and looks like it will fall off at any time. Don't buy."
2,Fit is terrible,"Fan works fine. Guards for fan blades (2 halfs) do not fix together. Tried for an hour, finally resorted to using zip ties to hold together."
5,power blast,"Very,very powerful fan. Actually, the breeze is stronger then the previous ""metal"" bladed fans I've purchased in the past. I use a fan all year, even with the a/c (thank you hot flashes) and this one is great. The remote is a must have life saver that fits perfectly under my pillow for those middle of the night cold blasts needed! I read previous reviews where people didn't like the fact that this fan is plastic, but I honestly don't know why that should matter. If you need a fan that really cools----this one is great!"
3,Disappointed,"Although the grill of this fan is about 20"" the fan blade is about 12"" and made of very thin plastic. I purchased and 18"" fan because an 18"" fan can move more air. This is not an 18"" fan. I consider this deceptive advertizing. Sadly, it is about impossible to find a decent fan these days. It seems that people who are under a certain age do not remember the kind of quality of merchandise we once had to choose from.This fan was easy to put together and I consider it to be quiet enough but it certainly is not powerful or effective. I doubt it will last more than a year or two. Very sad."
2,remote broke,Bought this product strictly cause it has a remote. After about 2 weeks the remote just stopped working. Other than that the fan works fine.
3,"if it had Natural Breeze Mode, as advertised, I would have given it 5 stars","It has become apparent that the company that makes this item, Lasko, is showing an advertisement for the older model in the description of the item. I just got one of these fans and it does NOT have Natural Breeze Mode. This was one of the main reasons I bought this fan. When I called Lasko they told me they have not had Natural Breeze Mode for some time now. They did not offer to replace it because they said NONE of their fans have Natural Breeze Mode. Besides not having that feature the timer is a bit different. The max you can set the time for is 4 hours. I told Lasko about this a couple weeks ago and they still have not changed the advert. I recommend not buying this item if you wanted it for the timer or for Natural Breeze Mode. If neither of those 2 things bother you then this is probably a good fan for you. I have actually come to like it and have nearly forgotten about the aforementioned features missing."
1,Terrible,"The remote must be pointed at precisely the right angle or it WILL NOT work (we're talking a matter of inches here). That is the minor inconvenience. The biggest problem is that the fan simply fails to deliver. I had to put it up to the highest level and still stand it right next to my bed (literally right in front of my face) and I would still wake up sweating. Today i tried adjusting it and the plastic base broke. PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE HIGH REVIEWS FOR THIS FAN, GET SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY. THIS FAN WILL DISAPPOINT YOU!!! (I've owned many fans over the years, because I am very hot natured person)"
3,Lasko 18 in remote fan,Doesn't look like this picture the fan blade area is bigger as well as the base is larger. This fan puts out a lot of air and the higher speeds are too much in a small room. It could use a quieter motor. It is hard to sleep on the higher speeds due to the noise. The remote feature works great. Easy to put together.A child could put it together.
4,Cool!,"Others have said it, but I will repeat. This is a really cool fan. It is bigger than I thought it would be, but the remot control is a godsend. It also puts out a LOT of wind. It will really keep you cool, but it is a little noisy."
4,Lasko 18 inch fan,"The fan was easy to put together and is extremely light. The remote did not work - the batteries with it were dead - and replacing the batteries did get it to work, but it is very sensitive to the angle you point it at the fan; if you don't get it just right the remote doesnt work. The fan is not the quietest fan in the house - I have a Lakewood that is much quieter. It does put out a lot of air, though, so I have overlooked the other issues."
3,"Good air mover, cheap plastic","I ordered this fan overnight because our old fan died in the middle of a heat wave! I knew it would be plastic, but for some reason it feels a bit cheaper than I expected. The base is also quite large compared to our last 18 inch fan. The controls seem nice and the remote is nice to have. It would be a bit better if it was metal encases rather than plastic. Overall I don't love the fan, but it will suffice for now since its the end of season and there are none in the stores!"
5,awesome,Bought this fan awhile ago and it is a very good fan. It has a very high output we are very pleased with it.
3,Not as described.,"When the fan arrived I was disapointed to see that it was not as described. It was not a 6 speed fan with breeze mode. It was a 3 speed fan. I went to Lasko's website and saw that they don't even have an 18"" fan with remote that has 6 speeds and breeze mode. The fan is extremely loud...but moves a lot of air. Low speed moves as much air as high speed on my last fan. It's a good fan, but it isn't the fan listed in the description."
2,had a part missing,the part to keep the bladein place was missing so the blades comes off from time to time
3,Does the job but louder...,"This fan does a great job with putting out a lot of air. However, I find the down side to be that it is rather loud. The fan is good, but just noisy. Am pleased with purchase. We use it as a breeze while we sleep, and it does a fabulous job. plus i can sleep thorough anything."
3,"Lasko 18"" Pedestal Fan","The fan just arrived and was in fact easy to assemble. The grill has a front and back which snap together with 8 plastic snaps that appear to be on the fragile side, but didn't break (yet). Beware! ""Six comfort settings plus natural breeze"" is VERY misleading. In fact, there are only three speed settings; low, medium, and high (rather noisy on high speed I must admit) and three settings for the timer of 1, 2, and 4 hours. Natural breeze must be leave the fan off and open your window??? The remote works o.k. (once you install your own two AAA bateries) and the timer is a nice feature if you tend to leave a room and forget to turn the fan off like me. Overall, I'd say it's a good value."
3,Noisy!,"I found this fan to be incredibly noisy. Even on the lowest speed, it is very powerful. If you are looking for a very strong and powerful fan, this fits the bill. If you are looking for a gentle, quiet fan that you can use while you sleep, stay away from this model."
1,Just not enough,"Very dissappointing purchase. Merely a 28-minute slideshow of black-and-white photographs with a British-sounding professor, reading out loud a biography. No interviews with conductors, performing musicians, whatsoever. Not one excerpt from his works being played, except for endless repetition of the ""Capriccio"" string sextet in the background. Very, very poor, indeed."
5,"Product great, web page picture wrong","The Waechtersbach Christmas Tree Teapot was received without problem and was a perfect replacement. However, the web page does not display the tea pot, it shows the plates."
5,Blue Collar Guys Rock,"I have soooo been waiting for this show to come out on DVD. I love the Blue Collar Guys. I have both the Blue Collar Comedy Tour movies, all of Jeff Foxworthys movies along with Larry The Cable Guys and Bill Engvalls. Heck I even have the Dolls. All I can say...it is side tickling FUNNY!!! One of my favorite parts is the redneck Dictonary."
5,Don't need to,"I didn't see it yet and don't need to, to know how funny it is.This Foxworthy, Engvall, and Larry The Cable Guy. You know it will be funny as hell."
3,I bought Vol.1 and Vol.2 for $7 only ~~~,"Yea, total of 5 DVDs for about $7, because I got a $25 giftsertificate from using my Amazon credit card.Anyhoo let's talks about the DVD in Vol.1. I have high expectation on these DVDs, I have seen 1 or 2 episode of Bule Collor TV show before I order the DVDs. I gotta tell you, I am pretty disapointted on the content on these DVDs. What makes me what to buy these DVDs is because I bought the Jeff Foxworthy Show 2DVDs set previously and love it. I thought I gonna get similar materials from the Blue Colloar TV, apparently not.I will tell you this, there is one part that is really funny where the 3 guys are in court cursing the judge out and causing a disturbance.Each episode is very short I wish they are longer.I hope Vol. 2 is ""funner"", I will write you a review soon."
4,Overall superb value for the money,"This is my 2nd digital camera (the first being a Sony Mavica FD-7) and have found this to be great camera for both indoor and outdoor use. Macro shots are fantastic and the 8x zoom is tough to beat on the other end of the scale. It does have issues in low light at maximum telephoto and in those cases a tripod may be required. Overall, I have not experienced too many issues at maximum zoom. Add some decent rechargeable NiMH batteries, a 128MB SmartMedia card (holds about 60 SHQ or 175 HQ photos), and you're set. The camera is light enough to carry all day and small enough to tuck into a bike pack."
2,"Good zoom, but poor low-light capabilities & slow autofocus","I bought this camera, then returned it... The 8x zoom is great, and it seemed like a great value -- but the electronic viewfinder is very poor, especially in low-light conditions, and the autofocus is too slow. I'm now trying the Fuji FinePix S602..."
3,No optical viewfinder,"Upgraded from a D-460 3x zoom for the 8x zoom. So far I don't care for the digital view finder. Red eye flash doesn't work in full auto mode; haven't reached the learning curve yet (100 shots) of focusing at maximum zoom. Photo quality, when focus is achieved is execellent, colors are true to life. Recommend? Maybe yes, maybe no; the jury is still out."
3,Wide angle problems??,"The specs show that this camera has the 35mm equivilent of 40-320 mm. With only going as low as 40mm, do wide angle shots suffer? Are wide angle adaptors available to screw on?"
2,Big and uncooperative,"Don't waste your money...there are much better cameras out there. This camera is too big, doesn't always cooperate, and takes horrible indoor pictures. It has an eight time zoom but the more you zoom the more distorted your photo is...very disappointing."
3,I noticed someone reviewed it as not for beginners.....,"And they are SO Right, it has so many whistles and horns, I cant figure out how to use it. The instruction book is as long as a novel. I have never used a digital camera, so I can guarantee that this one is HARD to understand.Once you figure out the important needs of the camera, the one part that is easy is getting the pictures on the computer. That is camera/computer friendly, and easy to understand.I noticed that all pictures have red eyes, and what I don't like the most, is I love taking pictures spontaneously, you can not take moving pictures at all, and that is a big downfall when you have kids and cats or dogs. Anything moving comes out blurry every-time. It is not the camera for those that like to be on the go, or like to take pictures as they happen. Its more for the mountain and tree type families, that take pictures of still objects."
3,Olympus C-720 Ultra-Zoom digital camera,"This camera has a great 8X lens, which attracted me. The 8X lens makes it possible to take clear photos of distant objects. The camera does not take good photos at night, as the lights all show up as large spots. And, the electronic viewfinder is difficult to use in other than optimal conditions. The LCD screen is too small for an otherwise competent camera. The photo processing computer program provided by Olympus is difficult to use, and would be much improved if it had right-click commands. The camera can use 4 AA batteries. Battery life with AA alkaline batteries is adequate, and they are much cheaper and more convenient to replace when traveling than $pecial camera batteries often required by other models. All in all, the 8X lens is what the Camedia has going for it."
4,Olympus Camedia C-720 digital camera W/ 8X optical Zoom,"The camera is really nice and works well but, will not work great in low light,unless you use the flash and are pretty close to your subject matter but not too close, other than that the zoom is really nice it really brings things in close and with the 8X Zoom the 3 megapixel is nice,I have taken some great photos in full light and in medium light making sure that the camera was held still. The software will let you do a lot just using the auto enhance option.On the down side it is just a bit too big to put in a shirt pocket so I had to get a bag for it or put it in a jacket pocket in cooler weather."
4,"Good photos, features; Bad focus, Redeye","I really enjoy this camera. For still shots, it is INCREDIBLE! However, the focus is incredibly slow and tacky for such an expensive camera. Oh. Redeye is another major problem with this camera. Almost every picture I take of a person has red eye.Oympus needs to work the kinks out, but I would buy this camera again."
2,Not for moving objects!!!,"My husband purchased this camera for me for Christmas. I'm sure it has some excellent features, but I can't get past the slow auto focus. I mainly used it for taking pictures of my 2 year-old twins and I've missed some really cute shots because of the slow focus. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!! I will be returning this camera tomorrow."
2,Nothing but Problems,"I did extensive research before purchasing this camera and ultimately chose it because of the zoom. It took awhile to adjust to using a digital camera, but once I did, I was enjoying it. Suddenly, about a month after purchasing the camera, all of the images (through the viewfinder, on the display screen and the words of the menu options) became reversed as if through a mirror. I spent hours on the phone with Olympus customer service and no tech could figure out how to remedy the problem. I ultimately had to send the camera to Olympus for repair, where it has been for 4 weeks. They say a part has to be ordered. I think this is outrageous for new camera and if I had it to do again, would not have purchased the C-720."
4,"Versitile, but still needs some tweeking","The Camedia is a great camera for anyone who takes photography somewhat seriously. The multi settings are great, from an automatic ANYONE can use, to the manual settings that will satisfy the amateur photographer. I wish they had put in a ring for manual focusing, as is now, the manual delays picture taking by anywhere from 1-2 seconds, on top of the already 1 second delay. For the price range, however, the camedia is the best you will get. If you would prefer higher MP the camedia 4mp with only 3x zoom is practicaly identical. I had a tough time deciding. The 3mp is good enough resolution for photo quality print outs at slightly less than a full sheet of paper. Compression rates are excellent, 7 pictures on the 16 megabyte card at SHQ, but only 1 at tiff (although the results are incredible). Also, the side output units rock. It even comes with a video out cord to hook up to a VCR.Conclusion- fun easy to use camera with many possibilities"
1,"Slow focus, motion blur, yellow photos","Very disappointed in this camera. Fine for still and outdoor photos, but between the slow focus and the motion blur, most pictures of our kids are a blur. We've missed many great shots. The lighting in the photos also comes out odd....often looks yellowish and the flash often makes this even worse. Most of the time, its hard to even tell the difference between a flash photo and one without flash. Forget this camera if you want to avoid frustration! And shame on Olympus for charging an extra $20 bucks to get a fully functional photo software program.....after spending [a lot] on the camera...of course, you don't know this when you buy the camera!"
5,so much energy.................and heart,I saw this band about a month ago never heard of there music before then. I was going to see the bouncing souls and didnt know of any openers and strike anywhere came out and played a great show with so much energy....I bought 'exit english' and 'change is a sound' i suggest if you like fast hardcore punk with meaning check out this group.
4,Remarkable,"If you need to be convinced to buy this record, you need only to go download ""You're Fired,"" one of the best songs I've heard in the past year. Even if you're not the political punk type, give this a chance: Strike Anywhere has a certain way of awakening that political side of things in you. Aside from blazing guitars and drums, it's the vocals that really make this band. The way this guy delivers his lines is impeccable, like none other. He makes you want to believe you can change the world.The downside of SA is that they only have one song, which they do variations on throughout the album. But I like that song. A lot."
3,digital candy thermometer,"This thermometer reads steady until you have to stir candy. The weight of the candy moves the probe all over the pan, and the reading jumps wildly by 20 degrees. I overcooked some peanut brittle because it gave me an erroneous reading. The attachment to the pot is too flimsy. It will probably work good if you don't have to stir the contents of what you are cooking. The display has big digits, but they are dim, especially when the steam fogs it up."
5,Flow Measurement Engineering Handbook,This is a classic title in flow measurement with a complete approaching that includes information about some measurement physical principles and the issues involved in flow correction due to the pressure and temperature of the fluid measured when considering contractual or basis conditions.
1,NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"The wrong card was ordered. i called and straightened out and they said they would send return authorization. They didn't, i've called at least twelve times, they will NOT continue helping me."
4,Memories are made of this!,There is an entire generation (or two or three!) of Italian kids who grew up eating pasta served from bowls that looked just like this! I had to get them because they reminded me of the pasta and salad bowls I grew up with. The quality is suberb; the colors are vibrant but not garish. A great value and just beautiful to boot. Buon appetito!
2,Good kitchen dishes but does show knife marks,"The dishes are more beatiful than the pictures show. However, after a few dinners, I noticed several knife marks on the large dinner plates. This is why I rated so low. Also, if you are using these dishes for regular use, you need to be aware that you can not soak them in water since the stoneware will soak up the moisture. So you and/or your family needs to clean dishes ASAP after each use.I was impressed that no dishes have chipped (even when loaded into the dishwasher with my teenager).I plan to use these dishes for a couple of years and then get replacements. I would not recommend these dishes due to the knife marks since it distracts from the dinner plates."
3,Not as good as the outlet,We had this set prior to getting them from Amazon. We had gotten them from the outlet store. These were on sale here at Amazon so I wanted to add to our set. There is a big noticeable difference between these and the ones in the outlet. These are made in China and the decals are different in color and quality. If you do have the ones from the outlet you will see the difference if held side to side. These also show the knife marks where the other set did not.
4,"A Light, Easy to Read Review","This book does not hit the Bob Woodward standard of a blow-by-blow account covering all participants, but it does offer an interesting view of the situation. I would have liked more discussion of the economic issues, but maybe there just was not the focus on them by Carter (that may explain the outcome of his administrations economic record). The author does write in an easy to follow method and comes off as more of a conversation between friends in place of a heavy political review. This is an interesting book that is worth the time if you are interested in the political environment during the hostage crises. There are better reviews of the election process namely by Elizabeth Drew."
5,An in-depth study worthy of college-level classroom attention for any American music history course,"Joining others in Greenwood's excellent college-level history series Guides to American Roots Music', FOLK MUSIC: A REGIONAL EXPLORATION covers all aspects of American folk traditions, from differing styles ranging from blues ballads to hollers and erotic songs, to instruments, regional differences in folk music, and the evolution of songs. A thorough exploration of major and minor genres and sub-genres keeps FOLK MUSIC an in-depth study worthy of college-level classroom attention for any American music history course."
4,Better than the movie,This book is very dark and sad. It is a glimpse into poeple getting lost in their dreams of a better tomorrow which turn into nightmares that they become trapped in. I feel especially sorry for the mom.
2,Really? What was the point?,"I don't know when I've read a book I was more dissappointed with when finished. The only thing this book did for me was point out the terrible atrocities dealt to the underprivelaged. But then again, we all know that and I didn't need to live through each page of agony."
1,Unintelligible...,It really helps when writers use things like puntuation and capital letters. This book was poorly written and the story was difficult to follow. I finally just deleted it from my kindle. There's probably only been two books in my life that were so bad that I didn't finish them - this was one of them.
2,Requiem For A ream,The language was terrible. Left me up in the air at end. Would not recommend this bookRequiem for a Dream
1,Punctuation omissions too distracting!,This might be a great book but the kindle version has so many punctuation omissions that I just couldn't make it through more than a few pages!
4,Great Book although it ended a bit abruptly,"This a wonderful book that paints the negative side of the american dream and gives good insight into the lives of those who try to achieve wealth quickly but get caught up in the grand scheme. The style of writing is unique and takes a little time to adapt to but once you get used to it, the style of writing draws you in and makes you identify with each character on a personal level. My only complaint is that this book ended quite abruptly, so much so that I wouldn't know it had finished if my kindle hadn't said you are done reading this book. This might just be my taste of course, I would have liked to see more about what happens with the mother and the main character after the incident with his arm."
5,Sad Story,"This is a type of book that will stay with me forever. When you're reading the book it's as if you feel what all the characters are going through. You're in their thoughts, you know what their feeling and thinking and you really start to feel sorry for all of them."
5,A good read...,"Not like the movie. This seems more real. I am surprised to find that Hubert had a lung problem and couldn't/wouldn't really get out the house. This is a tough story. It's about a group of kids with big dreams and with the dreams they need to supply the goods. Well, they really can't get jobs that pay 4oK (thousand) a year...so they sell drugs. Sadly, they are drug addicts and it get's worse. Broken promises, broken dreams. Takes place in Brooklyn in the 70's. I felt like Hubert knew what he was talking about. About how he described the drug houses and such. But nowhere where I read did it ever say he was a drug addict and hung out with druggies. A fast, swift, sad book."
5,Unbelievable,"this book is one of the best books i've ever read. Its haunting story of the terrors drug addicts face is unbelievable to say the least. You fall in love with Harry and feel his pain. Selby is a genious in my opinion, and though all his books are incredible, this one is one of the best. It will without a doubt make you think and realize how hard the world can be. READ THIS BOOK! it is undoubtedly worth the money. you'll love it."
1,Requiem for a Dream,"I DID NOT enjoy this read.....it was too scattered!! Would not recommend this novel at all. Did not care for the format or style ofauthor, Hubert Selby....."
1,Just not for me...,"I expected to love this book, instead it went in my collection named "" Couldn't Finish"". Maybe I didn't give it a chance but the drugs and language were just a little too much for me."
1,I don't get it...,"I'm sure the story is great as evidenced by the numerous 5 star reviews, and the fact that they made a pretty great movie based on this book. As for myself, I couldn't get beyond the writing style. I gave up before I even finished the first chapter because I couldn't tell what was going on, or to who.If you're one who can get beyond the writing style, I'm sure it's a great book, but for me it was a waste of the $2 or so I spent to download it."
2,After seeing the movie and the reviews i sadly bought it,"I try to always finish books that i start which is a brutal task in the case of this book. the movie was great because the director has a good eye for candy.I'm almost thinking it would have been the acclaimed movie it was even if it were about an inner city boy trying to make it in a private school because he's good at writing (he even uses paragraphs because being easy to read is art too!), great at basketball and aided by sean connery.If you want a good heroin book try out trainspotting. if you want to be in as much agony as the people you saw in the movie try this book out. This book is why i usually shy away from books that have been made into good movies because this one just isn't as much fun to read as it was to watch."
4,Pillar of Fire,"Covering the basic facts, without all the exra puff, makes it an enjoyable and informative series to watch."
4,They loved them!,"My ratties piled inside the snuggle sacks every. It was a common site to see three or four tails hanging out of the opening. They adored them, but alas they also chewed them to shreds much to quickly."
5,these are awesome!,these snuggle sacks are very good quality and are so soft inside! they are very roomy and i actually managed to order the right size for my Quaker parrots :) i made a special request to receive two different colors and the seller did it for me which i really appreciate <3 my birds thank you :)
4,New fan of Mark Pritchard.,"I gave it four because I can't relate to the gay sex between men but he writes it very well. Just a personal preference and not a slam to the quality of the book. The story about his insane cousin was friggin' hilarious and I could relate because I know a couple of people like her. He pushes the envelope more so than most, but in a brave and hot way. He's fearless in his writing and I really respect that. I've reread a couple of the stories because they were either hot, amusing, or both. Will read more of this guy in the future."
2,I wish I could get excited over this CD,"Alsop has recently been appointed music director of the Baltimore Symphony. A lot has been made of this because she is a she. I think she is a good conductor and quite capable. But, I feel there is little ""magic"" in what she does. This Brahms 1st is clean and well played but there is none of the drama and individuality that you find in versions by Karajan or Walter.I hope that Alsop will be judged based on her music making and not her gender. I also hope she is successful in Baltimore. And, yet, as evidenced by this recording and others of her's I have heard, I think the jury is still out."
1,*Yawn*,"There's far too much hype surrounding Alsop's Brahms. Maestra Alsop has supposedly spent incalculable hours studying Brahms' scores to find those precious new nuggets that have somehow escaped other conductors. With all that, I expected to hear new interpretive insights ... but there were none. With so many important recordings of the Symphony No. 1 already out there -- Wand, Tennstedt, Dorati, Stokowski and Toscanini to name just a few -- this recording becomes completely unnecessary."
4,The Sixth Sense,"A great book. It's quick, sweet, and to the point. Cole really touched my heart with how mature he was for such a small child, yet still just a little boy at heart. He carried a talent that could either be horrifying or beautiful. I was so surprised at the end. A lot of people said they predicted the ending around the middle of the book, not me. It was a total shock!"
1,Rip-off !!!!,"This was a complete waste of money...Ok, this guys make a conference and then publish the proceedings...The papers (I mean ""chapters"") are quite specialized. The claim inthe back cover that ""relevant ideas are introduced in a self-containedmanner and only a knowledge of calculus and linear algebra is assumed""is just a straight lie. My interested in the book was chapter 12,systems of partial differential equations but I obtained just a briefsummary of the theory that is not useful at all."
3,happy but...........,"This is a great toy that my two year old had to have. But it is extremely difficult to put together. I have little girls who wanted the pink version and there appears to be a serious problem with the contruction of the vehicle the front bars do not appropriately fit the model and the door does not stay in place. The directions are kind of a free for all as is the case with most childrens toys. Toys R us is no longer helpful, it seems they are so preoccupied with closing stores they forgot that customer service is a valued asset. Needless to say beware of assembly. It appears that the bars are from a different model and it may be only the case with the pink car but I would be wary."
4,"PAY THE $10.00 , GET IT ASSEMBLED!!!!!","First let me start off by saying,my 15 month old has a great time with this toy!! Now in saying that, you have to be HERCULES to put it together!!!Most of the parts do not fit together the way they should.The top of the car is very hard to get together,seems like once you get one piece in the other piece comes apart again!!!Then the steering wheel is difficult also.We ended up taking the first one we baught back,due to not fitting right.We recieved another one,this one had scratches all over it!!But OH well!!! It worked we kept it and our daughter loves it !!"
4,Fun Car but Stickers Fall Off,"This was a perfect first birthday gift for my son from his Godmother! The only problem we have has with it is that the stickers peel off. I have no idea why!!! The car has never been outside our home, so it's not like it is in the weather. We have a large living room and it is a perfect inside toy for that. My brother assembled it for him after his party and had no problem putting it together. Watch out for the stickers, they will fall off."
3,MISLEAD BY EDITORIAL REVIEW,"The Editorial Review for this item states ""the front wheels swirl like stroller wheels making them especially responsive to the steering wheel"". This is not true, the steering wheel does not control the front wheels at all....your child will not be able to steer this vehicle. That would have made this a much better toy, but instead my daughter has very little control in the direction it goes."
1,Why change a good thing?,"We have looked everywhere for the OLD car like this one. Stores have told me that they have now gone to this cheaper, more flimsy model for the same price. I am SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. The older model was SOOOOOOOOOOOO much sturdier and better quality. Why change a good thing? This one is SO CHEAPLY made!!!!!!!!!"
2,Nice poster but poor quality photo,"I like this poster, but the quality of the picture was not good. The images were grainy especially Paul's face where you can barely make out the left side of his face. From a distance maybe you will not notice, but I am fairly picky so it bothered me. The seller however was very prompt in responding to my refund request and quickly issued me a refund."
3,At Least It's Hypo-Allergenic,"I have a severe contact dermatitis allergy to regular string rosin, so this rosin was a necessity. Although it is indeed hypo-allergenic, the sound quality is not very good, and has a distinct scratchy quality to it. However, this is the only hypo-allergenic rosin that I know of, so I guess this setback cannot be avoided. Overall, it does what it's supposed to do, but not very well."
4,Very nice,Played for years and there wasn't such a product available. Gave this as a Christmas gift and was really pleased. Wonderful!
5,Its awesome,"This rosin is great. Its easy to clean from the violin, and it doesn't produce as much dust as the cheap rosin brands."
4,Nice and fast shipping!,I ordered the blue color for my nine year old who was getting an itchy nose and sneezing using the standard block of rosin that comes with his violin. This brand was recommended by his violin teacher. I ordered it on a Friday and it arrived Monday in the mail. Thanks!
1,Only received half of my order.,I have written twice and have gotten no reply as yet.I only receive one of two suit cases. I've asked amazon to help me figure out what happened to my order. I STILL have not had anyone help me.
3,I didn't rent it but... it made me laugh.,"""It's is a boy girl thing"" isn't the kind of movie I'd normally rent. In fact, I didn't rent it, but when I found it in my house, I gave in to temptation and watched it. I must confess it made me laugh.This film is very predictable, but quite funny, despite the fact that the humor is rather crude sometimes... The two main characters are Nell (Samaire Armstrong), a bright and somewhat nerdy young woman, and Woody (Kevin Zegers), a football player that has the popularity that Nell lacks, but isn't very accustomed to using his brain. Even though these typical albeit very different teenagers can't stand each other, they will have to reach a compromise, due to an spell that ends up switching their bodies. Confusion ensues, as you can imagine...All in all, I think that those that are expecting the classic high school comedy will like it, if their expectations are just to have some fun... If that is your case, recommended."
4,"Nothing unexpected, except how much fun it is.","Yes, it's a body swap story. It's been done before. I had this one in my queue because I'm a fan of Samaire Armstrong. I didn't expect to like the movie. But I definitely did. The characters are well enough done that I actually cared what happened to them. There's not a lot more to say. If you're looking for a fun movie with engaging characters and story that are brought to life by actors that did a great job... give ""It's a Boy Girl Thing"" a shot.One more quick thing I almost forgot. I ordered it from Amazon right after I finished watching the movie. I like it enough that I want it in my collection."
3,Comedy Just misses being very good.,The leaders are very good. They almost make you believe a body swap happened. Some good laughs (like when he in the girl's body gets a bikini wax but a little preachy.At first they try and ruin each other's lives which makes no sense since they have no idea how long they are going to be each other - it could be fore ever. The movie gets better when they try and help each other - she to learn football and he to learn poetry and literature.Near the end they actually like being each other and in a touching scene say they would be honored to live as each other. It might have been a better or more original film if they didn't change back.Good ending at the prom as well as good use of Shakespears poetry
5,Tolerable teen fluff,"Suppose the mind ofFreaky Fridaywere mysteriously transported to the body of just about any teen movie ever - you'd get something that looked a lot like this. Instead of mother and daughter this time, it's a teenaged boy and girl whocan barely stand each other. He's the uberjock, with the big homecoming game coming up, she's the Yale-bound, bookish type.The result is pretty predictable: bathroom and locker room jokes, some body-part humor but less than you might think, and a happy ending all around. Oh, and theMean Girlscharacter ends up publicly embareassed (spelling is intentional), which just goes towards making the ending happy. Best watched if you're doing something else at the same time.-- wiredweird"
3,It was kind of fun,"Okay, I did enjoy this movie for the most part. The actors did a good job with a pretty predictable plot that really had only one possible resolution. All of the characters were stereotypes of one sort or another but of course, the two leads get over their personal prejudices and move to the inevitable ending. sigh. If there was one thing that could have made this better (at least from my perspective) is that they could have done away with so much of the humor being dependant upon sexual organs. The film was cute, funny and touching. It seemed to be pretty well acted and made you feel good in the end. Oh, and Nell's dad: There was a man of integrity. What a guy! Worth seeing...once"
4,New twist on an old theme--surprisingly excellent comedy,"I have to admit that I didn't expect this film to be so good. The body swap has been done so often that it didn't seem possible to come up something fresh. Well, this film succeeds. Kevin Zegers and Samaire Armstrong are really outstanding performers and make this gender-swap fantasy work. Very entertaining."
5,Hilarious romantic comedy,This movie is great! Freaky Friday meets high school romance. The actors do a great job and make it believable. A good movie especially for high school girls
4,An informative account of a crucial figure in U.S. financial,"I learned a lot about Wall Street history from this book. The relatively overnight successes of technology driven Wall Streeters should not obscure the more remarkable achievements of Charlie Merrill. The author skillfully describes the times in which Merrill operated and gave me a balanced view of Merrill's strengths and weaknesses. The story moves swiftly along and I gained a real appreciation of the future Merrill saw, the opportunities he capitalized on, and those he inspired along the way."
1,Embarrassing attempt at biography,"In his introduction, the author attempts vainly to put Merrill in the same category as Morgan and other great financiers. The problem is that he was not a financier, just a guy riding the trend of retailing in the 1920s. But his gratitude for his own personal pension fund appreciating in the 1990s and attributing it to people like Merrill is extremely embarrassing. This suggests that the author is trying to ingratiate himself to Merrill's company. A little balatant. More to the point, Mr. Perkins did not seem to understand his topic very well. He constantly refers to the backroom at Merrill as ""backstage."" The backroom and its problems was a big topic on Wall St from the 1950s through the 70s although Perkins seems unaware of the whole problem and constantly refers to it as backstage. Did anyone ever research a topic so poorly? Whether Merrill deserves a full fledged biography still remains unclear after reading this amateurish attempt."
4,Chamber of Secrets Starter Deck,"Well, this item is fairly decent, for a starter deck. Starter Decks as a rule usually dont hold very good cards. One example of this is the Base Set starter deck. This deck is no big exception. You get your two holo character cards, and a bunch of common and uncommon ones,same as normal. Overall, unless you are just starting to play Harry Potter(hence ""Starter Deck""), you shouldnt buy this, but just buy a couple of booster packs. So enjoy this if you buy it cuz Harry Potter TCG is a lot of fun to play!"
4,Very Amero-Centric,"This is a very good book, but it seems to ride heavily on American-Central Asian policy, and not as much on the Central Asian independent policy. Overall, a very good introduction to Central Asian policy, with the understanding that Central Asia is viewed through a prism of American Foreign Policy. Very clear, simple language. I would recommend at least a basic literacy in Central Asian politics before diving in, or else some of what is being addressed may be lost to the audience."
4,Simple but addicting,"Bomberman is a classic game, and the gameplay is deceptively simple, but believe me, the game is not easy. The challenge level keeps this game interesting, along with the extra powers that Bomberman can earn (increased blast range, multiple bombs, etc) The game can get repetitive, so you can use the password feature when you want to take a break from the game."
1,Useless Puller,I purchased this puller for its intended purpose and it not only failed but immediately broke with very little pressure being applied. I notified the company and was told the manufacturer had discontinued the product but they contacted the manufacturer for me and they immediately sent me a replacement puller at no charge from remaining stock. I thought this was a great gesture. After waiting for a few days the new puller arrived. Let me preface this by saying I have used a similar puller on Pitman arms on smaller vehicles many times. I attempted to use the replacement puller the on the arm again and the claw snapped off immediately with very little pressure being applied. The claw broke in the exact same spot as the first puller I used. I would not recommend this product.
4,An Enjoyable Alien Invasion Tale,"I am a bit hot and cold on John Ringo. I really like some of his book series, such as the March to the Sea series and the Looking Glass books and Troy Rising, while his other stuff doesn't interest me at all, particularly his Kildar books.But Into the Looking Glass is a fun sci-fi romp with lots of great characters, humor and wonderful technobabble. I never get tired of reading it. My only complaint is that some of the characters about which I would have liked to read more are just dropped and never heard from again---those that aren't summarily killed, anyway."
4,"Another great start to a series by Ringo, along with Travis Taylor.","An experiment gone wrong destroys most of Orlando and opens a portal toanother world. It also spins off other portals that soon attract the kindof attention that Earth wishes they wouldn't. The aliens use biotech andhope to add the biomass of our planet, which they ruthlessly convert totheir own, to their Empire. A space scientist and a Navy SEAL are calledupon to combat the aliens, while Earth tries to bootstrap itself into thefuture to deal with a coming invasion like they have never imagined. Verygood military science fiction."
