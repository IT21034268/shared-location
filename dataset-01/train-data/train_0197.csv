5,"First, get a flu shot","If you had the chance to go back in time, knowing you could change nothing, would you? It sounds like an easy promise to Oxford University student Kivrin, heading back to the 14th Century. Her trip is meant to be an academic exercise, not much more, but through an error she is dropped in the path of the Plague and into the lives of a family she comes to love. Meanwhile, back at the lab, a ferocious virus has attacked the 21st Century city of Oxford -- including the only people who can to bring Kivrin home. Suspenseful, bittersweet and fascinating."
2,"Overrated, avoid!","This is probably the single most overrated SF book in recent years. I haven't read it in a while (and I *never* will again), but it left the impression of being slow, non-scientific (which you'd kinda hope a Hugo/Nebula winner *would* be), and generally boring. I forced myself to finish the book in the hope that it would get better. It did - when I was done, and able to read something else. The book is not horrible, just horribly overrated, and I'd recommend a potential buyer/reader to look elsewhere unless you've read everything else in the genre."
2,Maybe I missed something.,"I don't normally read sci-fi novels. This book was recommended to me, although I can't imagine why. As far as novels go, it is okay - not all that exciting, but well written in its way. I think it would have been better if there had been more detail into how they invented time travel rather than endless pages of characters rushing from one place to another and then have them do nothing when they get there.The parts that take place in the Middle Ages were better than those taking place in ""present time,"" if only because there was some activity. After Kivrin regains her health, her interactions with the inhabitants of 14th century england were far more entertaining than the stymied medical personnel back in her home time.I assume the book was labeled as sci-fi because of the time travel element. It didn't seem too sci-fi beyond that. Overall, I thought it was mediocre."
1,Not recommended,"Throughout the first part of this book it continually rains, which made me more than once wonder when all the cardboard characters were going to dissolve and wash away. This book is simply bad, and the part that should have been most interesting, the part spent in the past, contains too limited locations, plot, and characters to really satisfy. Several of the plot points are so artificial and poorly resolved that the book becomes an exercise in frustration. I cannot recommend this book."
4,"excelent, deserving of the nebula","From the point of view of a historian this book is an excelent attempt at viewing the past how it really was with an engrossing spin of sci fi added. Willis obviously did a great deal of research before writing this novel because many of the misconceptions about medival times are not illustrated here, instead she manages to accuratley portray a time that is virtually unknown to us even though it is on our very own planet."
5,Loved it!!!!!,"After I read Blackout by Connie Willis on my Kindle, I was dying to read Doomsday.But at that time Doomsday wasn't available on Kindle so I got it from the library and loved it!! I now see that it's available on e book so I just bought it ~ While I know this isn't really a review of the book, I think if you like timetravel this is the book for you. And if you do like timetravel get Blackout and its sequel All Clear, set in WWII, I highly recomend it."
4,An excellent book with a mediocre printing job,"I would give Connie Willis' ""Dooms Day Book"" an unqualified five stars.It was a captivating read. I recommend it warmly. The four star ratinghas to do with the book's physical aspect. The printing of this editionwas truly disappointing. There is so little margin on the pages, onewonders if the publisher was afraid of running out of paper."
5,Great Sound isolation,"These earphones are incredible, I was on a plane and with them I was able to listen to my music in calm and with a raisonable sound level.At the beginning you'll need one hour to feel good with the earphones but after it is really confortable.Enjoy music with ER6i"
4,Simply Amazing,"There is no comparison to the usual headphones people wear. i.e. sony, ipod, phillips. These bring a whole new listening experience to your ear. When placed in the ear cavity right these provide music without any outside annoyance. The only thing is it took me a couple days to realize that even though it sounded good, if I played around with the insertion it would sound even better. Unless you have to have mega-bass then the bass is just fine. Set your Ipod equalizer on the R&B and it will increase the bass through your Ipod as well. With the amazon price at around $80 you can't go wrong. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is comfortability. This might go away after time when Ive worn them for awhile and its not that bad, the music quality overides that. You receive two different styles of plugs one is phlange like and the other like a expandable foam. If you love music skip a couple meals and get these."
1,Etymotic ER-6i,"I just loved the Etymotic ER-6i - while it worked. However my first ordered earphone left side's volume reduced about 90% less after about 2 weeks usage. Though I tried to clean and change the filter, it did not help. Because I really loved the sound quality and noise reduction level (i am a gardener and I am using very noisy machines) I ordered at once another pair of earphones. Unfortunately the second one took only 1 day. In the second day morning I realized, the left ear bud just quitting to work like the first one, only the sound level went down ""only"" about 60%-70%.After that I suspect this is a common problem with the ER-6i (Possibly that is the reason to sell for less on Amazon)I sent an e-mail to Etymotic and waiting for answer about exchange the defective items. I hope they know about the problem and solved it already."
5,Money well spent,"These 'phones sound great and isolate noise well. No overhyped bass here. They are great for air travel and don't scream, ""I got taken by the Bose marketing machine."""
3,Clear but lacking,"These phones are very clear but slightly too bright in my opinion. My biggest complaint is that there is a major lack of bass. Yes, the bass is there but it does'nt have enough punch--which is a major problem for me because my music library consists mostly of rock. I returned these and upgraded to the Ultimate Ears Superfi 5 pros. Hopefully the Superfi's will satisfy...."
1,"Average Sound, Garbage Quality","I'd barely used them a few months and one side suddenly cut out -- nothing to do about it. Warranty was no good anymore, customer service useless. Expensive product for crap quality and average sound. I would never recommend these to anyone."
2,Favorite Headphones ever...until they broke out of warranty,"Etymotics made a fantastic sounding pair of headphones. I bought mine several years ago. Last year however, one of the channels started to cut out, so i sent it back to etymotics and despite being out of warranty they sent me a new pair. This new pair was great...until it too broke. I checked on several audiophile forums and this appears to be a design flaw with the ER-6i's, there is essentially nothing protecting the soldered connections, so natural wear eventually will cause them to fail prematurely. This time when I called Etymotics they told me that I would be able to buy a new pair for the discounted price of $75... the price of a new pair on Amazon. Thanks but no thanks, I'd prefer to spend my money on a quality set that will last more than a 12 months."
4,Great Earphones,"After using the ipod earphones, these are much more comfortable and don't hurt my ears. The sound quality is excellent and the fit is comfortable. I'm still trying to find the best earpiece for my ears. Three different earpieces are included. But so far (3 weeks) I'm very happy. I don't find that these earphones filter outside noise as much as I'd like for them but I didn't want to pay the price for that feature."
4,Pretty good for the price!,"First I tried the foam earpieces, which are great! Great sound, great fit, and just like real earplugs, it blocks out a lot of outside noise. Obviously since they're foam they get dirty and 'wear' out pretty fast. If spending around $14 for replacements every few months is no big deal, you'll never complain about these.Trying the rubber earpieces is a little more difficult. Some people claim to have chosen the right one and it's amazing, but it wasn't quite that easy for me. I found that the medium size fits for me, but it's really difficult to get them 'sealed' in your ear. If you don't get them 'sealed' in your ear, the sound just isn't the same. The other people who complain about the sound on these aren't getting them 'sealing' in their ear properly. So while it isn't easy to do I figured it out and am very happy with the purchase."
4,"Good sound but,,,","Sound is very clear and I like it even on a plane. I agree bass is not so strong but don't think too weak if you can wear it correctly, althogh it is not so simple to wear. My biggest complain is for too long cord. It doesn't fit for walking or do something. I will use it only in travel."
3,Good and bad,"The sound quality of these earphones compares equally to a SHURE pair I bought last year. But I am extremely disapointed with the quality of the material and overall feel of the product. The cords are very thin and not substantial like the cords on SHURE. I feel like I have to be extra careful with the cords or they will easily break/tear. For the price ($79) the manufacturer definitely needs to step up the quality of the materials, not just the sound quality. I didn't return these but I am not sure I would buy another pair because of the materials."
2,"Good fit, bad bass","I bought these because i was looking for a different type of insert. I previously (and still), owned a pair of Sennheiser CX 300 but the fit was less than perfect. So I was excited when I tried on the er6i's, very comfortable. But the excitement quickly faded when I turned on my ipod, where was the bass!? Checked the fit, checked the instructions, played with equalizer settings, nothing. Bottom line: had I been able to preview the sound from the er6i compared to the CX 300, I would never have bothered with the er6i's. Whatever I lose in the fit, options, packaging, or other quality points of the er6i, is more than compensated with the rich bass and clear highs of the Sennheisers. Not only did the er6i lack bass, the highs sounded tinny to me. I guess everyone hears things differently, too bad you can't try before you buy."
2,Great for listening to your heart and breathing....,"It must be because the ""plugs"" create such a seal in your ear, but I had a very hard time listening to my music above the noise created by my heartbeat and breathing. I really can't recommend these earphones to anyone."
2,Too delicate,I returned the earphones because they are difficult to fit in the ear. They throw off your balance when working out and feel uncomfortable. The included soft earbuds reduce the sound clarity but are somewhat more comfortable.
2,Not for those who favor bass!,"The clarity and isolation are definitely there, but if you're a basshead like I am, don't even think about buying this product."
1,Didn't work for us.,"We bought these earphones because they got a great review in a PC magazine. However, they did not isolate noise at all. The intention was to use them for listening to audio books on an ipod while commuting. However the original ipod earphones did a better job. The sound quality was not good. They may be better if used just for music, but it didn't suit our needs."
4,"Amazing noise isolation, great sound, not too uncomfortable","Comes with regular, small and foam earpieces. I don't find them uncomfortable and have worn them up to two hours in airliners. Fantastic in airliners to cut cabin noise...can listen to music at reasonable volume without having to max out iPod volume to overcome cabin/engine noise. There is a technique to putting them in--not something you want to keep putting in and taking out frequently. Great sensitivity, good volume and bass out of an iPod. Be careful not to pull on cord when taking them out--I haven't broken the wires but they look fragile."
4,Etymotic ER6i,These earbuds are a great improvement over factory IPod earbuds. They are very comfortable and don't become dislodged during a workout or running. The bass level is adequate but not overwhelming. I can't comment on their durability as I have only been using them for a couple of weeks.
1,Go for another brand,"Bottom line, these things sound horrible compared to other brands of IEMs (in ear monitors). I was completely unimpressed with the base and mid-range frequencies of these phones. I currently own 2 pairs of Shure phones and absolutely love them. Stay away from the Etymotics."
2,"No Bass, High Price","This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have ever made. The earphones sound like crap companied to my $30 Sony earphones. For over one hundred dollars I expected much better, my biggest gripe is the bass or the lack of. Do your self a favor and buy something else."
1,So Close,"I'll give them one star despite their quality. The overall rating of these headphones on Amazon is spuriously high. Here is what I've found. Very good sound quality. Terrible earbuds. The flange tips are very uncomfortable, very difficult to form a adequate seal (thus dramatically reducing sound quality), but secure in the canal. The website does have replacements, but they are relatively expensive. The foam tips that are provided are, however, Much better which salvages these headphones. Therefore, these are good headphones with a baffling design for the earbuds."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with these headphones for few reasons: 1) the price leads you to believe that the headphones will perform unlike any other headphones on the market RESULT: poor to non-existent bass; 2) reviews are rather good RESULT: don't trust all reviews. I am returning the product after the first 5 minutes of use. Frankly my Sony MDR-A35 perform 10 times better and have better bass plus no hassle to put them in the ears and no need to change ear-plugs etc. Sony cost $19.99, Etymotic ER6i cost $140. I rarely return items (especially after paying a high price for shipping) but this time the disappointment is motivating enough for me to ship back the item."
2,I don't hear it.....,"These are some of the worst earphones I have ever had. They are not just uncomfortable...they hurt when I try to insert them in my ears. (Maybe I have small ears) The sound is so awful...boom box quality at best.I read the reviews here and I thought these earphones would deliver high quality sound. I was wrong. Perhaps I don't have them stuck far enough in my ear and that is why they sound so terrible. I don't want to have to suffer so much discomfort to hear the sound ""properly"". It is not worth it. I spent $129.00 and I am upset. I would have been better off buying a pair of $19.95 Sony earphones.I wish I could find something nice to say. I really can't think of anything. Sorry guys....that is my 2 cents worth."
1,Horrible product,"As a musician, let me say that these earphones are not worth the money. Bass response is horrible and the phones distort at even low volumes. Pass on these."
3,"""Decent"" sound for a ""great"" price","I've used about a dozen sets of noise isolation earbuds and compared to many, these are good. Unfortunately, with the price tag, that is not a good thing. At $90, these should have far more power - particularly bass. The output just isn't there.If you're looking for servicable earbuds at a price point where they should be outstanding, go for these. They won't disappoint you. So long as you have low standards."
5,incredible sound!,This is as good as noise cancellation earphones! They isolate really well and have incredible response. I use these for running and they are incredibly comfortable. Lots of options for sizing really helped. My wife has some in ear buds I cannot stand because they fall out and are not comfortable. Found my fit with these on my second try. Really a great product!!
4,Great headphones,"I use them more for earplugs than head phones. Such as when I'm meditating, or trying to sleep. I play some soothing music at a low volume, and the isolation factor of these headphones keep out the outside noise without me having to turn up the music (which distracts you when you're trying to meditate). But as far as using them just for listening to music, I don't know about that. Mostly because I've only used them for meditation and sleep. So if you want to use them for that purpose, I'd recommend them; but if you're looking for headphones just for music, I can't say if these are good or bad."
3,"Sounds great, blocks noise, wires will go bad quickly","I have had 3 pairs of these earphones and they are the best sounding, most isolating earphones that I have ever owned.But I have noticed a disturbing trend. Each subsequent pair lasts less and less time. It's always been a wire fault, usually breaking at the plug or in the middle of the wire. I don't think that I treat them harshly, but they are earphones, the wires tend to get caught in stuff and bent around things and sometimes pulled out of the player. The first pair lasted 3 years, the next 2 years and the last only one year before the wiring got wonky. Soldering on the plug from a generic pair of phones is often possible if you are good at soldering one hair to another, but it's tricky and only buys you another couple of months.For such an expensive pair of phones, a more robust cord would be nice. I hate to throw away an $80 pair of headphones because of a ten cent plug coming apart inside or a 5 cent wire breaking inside the insulation."
1,"Flimsy construction, mediocre sound","My wife thought I was dumb for paying almost $100 for these about a year ago. Turns out she was right.They finally failed on me due to a weak connection of the wire to the headphone jack. The dual wires on these are thin and easy to damage. They definitely isolate sound (like any in-ear device) but the sound lacked significant bass extension in my opinion. There is also a filter inside that frequently gets clogged - easily replaced for $20 or so (seriously?).I recently got some SkullCandy ear buds for just over $10 and they sound much nicer, have better construction, and a microphone (good for the iPhone).If you are an audio snob and have to wear the high end stuff, then these are for you. As long as you can live with mediocre sound, flimsy wires, and you are prepared for them to fail at some point."
2,Expensive short-use earphones,"Upon the recommendation of a co-worker, I purchased the Etymotic ER6i earphones about a year ago. Initially, I was very pleased, as the sound quality was superb and the earphones where really comfortable to wear, even for an extended period of time. However, after several months of use, the right earphone stopped working all-together and a few months after that, the left earphone started to break in and out. For a product priced as this, one would expect better reliability than several months of use before it stops working properly. Not to mention, the expensive filters that seem to require constant replacement/cleaning. Overall, I would say that I am rather dissatisfied with this purchase and will be looking at cheaper alternatives in the future."
2,Not designed to last,"The very thin wires and the poorly designed grip system for removing the phones from your ears add up to a poor quality experience. Yes, these phones sound good for the money and they isolate reasonably well, but don't expect them to last long."
3,okay but failed after 1 year,"I found these headphones to be very good. nice sound and isolation, but after about one year the left earphone started getting a crackling noise especially at higher volumes and with deep bassy sounds. I was not rough with them. I took quite good care of them, keeping them in their pouch when not in use, but they still developed problems after the warranty period had expired."
3,Didn't work for me,"I am somewhat who sleeps with earplugs, so I have no problem wearing in-ear earbuds (which need to be placed deep inside the ear canal to obtain decent bass). Still, I felt the ER6 miniature drivers didn't generate enough bass. Clarity and spatiality in the mid range was very good, but I felt high frequencies were a bit too present. In short, these earbuds were not for me, but I don't want to discourage others from trying them. They generate what I feel is an unusual but highly detailed sound that some may find to their liking."
1,poor reliability,"Poor reliability. The wires broke three times at the same spot - where it enters the plug. Each time I sent it back, customer support sent me a new pair. Great customer support for a poorly-designed product. The filter nonsense quickly got old. First one filter got clogged, then the other. When I ran out of the extra filters provided, I finally pulled out the filters entirely. That actually worked fine so you have to wonder what the point of the design of the filters are."
4,Good inner ear headphones,"Overall, I'm very happy with these headphones - the only beaf I have is that they started to fall apart after 1 year - just after the warranty. This is a repurchase for me. The first pair still work, but certain songs will sound distorted - I think others have reported a similar finding that the solder comes loose over time, or something like that. I guess you just can't hope that your headphones will last forever. I listen to them almost every day on my 1:10 commute to and from NY city and I can't imagine not having them. I would not recommend these for activities though because you will hear the wires brush against your shirt and coat when you are walking which cab be annoying. They are prefect for long plane or train rides where you want to be left alone - you can have a baby screaming behind you and you wouldn't know it with these in your ears."
2,"These are made poorly, stay away.",These sound great and I like the way they isolate outside sounds BUT I have had TWO pairs fail where the wire has came loose in the earbud. Both pairs lasted less than 6 months. Many people have had the same problem and the company will not do a replacement. Stay away.
4,Good Headphones,I went into the market to find some replacement headphones for my Ipod. I found two pairs of headphone ER6i and the Shure210B. These out performed the Shure in the tests so I went wtih these.These are good headphones but I would like to see the cables heavier.
4,Great value,"The noise reduction on these earphones are excellent. The sound quality is very good. The extended battery life that you get out of your iPod, because you don't have to have the volume cranked to play over the background noise, is an added bonus. My only complaint is not really a complaint, just an observation: if you've got smaller than average ear canals, these are probably not going to be completely comfortable. They come with multiple fit ear fittings, but even the smallest are a tad too large for me. Still the discomfort can be almost completely aleveated by reducing the number of times that you take the earphones in and out.Definitely a better buy than the over-ear or on-ear, battery using, limited sonic spectrum headphones."
4,Excellent Quality!,"I love these!!! At first, the bass may seem low, but if you listen to these for a day, and compare to your other pairs, you will find that the bass is just right (IMHO), and some EQ settings on your player will make it just right for your tastes.As mentioned by other reviewers, make sure you get a good fit in the ears. Etymotic will send you samples of their earplugs, so you can try which fit you the best.I have been listening to these the whole day today, and just love the sound reproduction. These are my most expensive headphones ever, and boy, I am totally satisfied!"
3,good news / bad news,"The ER6i's work great on a long airplane ride. They do isolatejust about all sounds but the music! The ""bass"" is better than the ER6's but still weak ! The good news is I found the betterchoice. PHILIPS ""virtual surround sound ear buds"" cost $19.99.These 20 buck buds blow away the 90 buck ER6i's.keep rockn' ROCKnRoad/ mike"
3,"If youre not a classical-music-strictly person, this earphone is not recommended","For clarity, no question this is a very good earphone. This perfectly suits classical music, songs with piano-only accompaniment or simple guitar, soft, mellow, bedroom music in general. You will hear details--the sprinkle in the string, that timbre in the voice, that slight switch in plucking--that youve never heard before.But rarely does a person today have a library strictly of these genre. Even some nursery rhymes need some bass. Whatever your age, you would want that upbeat, dance music in your iPod. Just by this vitue alone, this earphone is not recommended. It is not recommended for 'general use,' if you want to put it that way. More so if you have some hip hop music; the sound of rap beats from this earphone is disorienting. Truly lacks bass."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I bought these after my Apple Earbuds stopped working, and after reading many positive reviews I had high expectations. After the bass heavy muffled output from my Apple Earbuds, the ER6i's were a bit of a shock, much better treble and midrange, but virtually non existent bass, I mean almost none. I tried adjusting the EQ settings on my Ipod Touch to Bass Booster but this resulted in distortion at very moderate volumes. I'm not a bass head by any means, but I expected a lot better from these particularly when it says 'Enhance bass response' on the box."
2,earbuds,I frankly hear very little improvement over the run-of-the-mill earbuds. At 76 bucks or so I expected a significant difference. Probably my hearing isn't good enuf to appreciate the quality these buds are supposed to represent. I still prefer my ancient over-the-head tiny-bud set i got with my 1980's sony tape walkman. They stay on while I walk and the sound is acceptable.gm
1,Sounds Like an Old Wire Crystal Radio,After reading other reviews for the Etymotic ER6i I purchased it for use on long overseas airline flights. Before my last trip I tested the new ear buds with my Ipod Nano. I was shocked with the poor quality of the sound. The sound reminded me of the very tinny sounds from a 1910 home built wire crystal radio. I tried each of the removable ear pieces with no improvement. Obviously I wasted the cost of these ear buds and I have returned to using the Apple ear buds that came with my Nano.
5,Good Headphones for Motorcycles,"I bought these headphones to replace the standard iPod ones I've been using for years. These fit great under my Shoei helmet, and also helps eliminate a lot of the wind noise I've been getting at high speeds. I have also found them useful while on an airplane with screaming kids all around. These headphones block a lot of unwanted noise. Thanks Etymotic Research!"
3,"Nice sound, nice design, poor quality control",They sound nice but bass is a little quiet which I knew might be an issue before I bought. 4 out of a 5. The cords are very light but feel flimsy like they might break in half if they got caught on something. 4 out of 5. The small triple flange set had a deformity which makes it uncomfortable. So poor quality control drops these down to a 3 out of 5.
4,Etymotic ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones,"I use these headphones for medical transcription and they are wonderful for the noise-isolation feature. Apparently, I have small ear canals and they do hurt my ears, even with the smallest tips on. In that respect, they are not comfortable at all, but would probably be great for someone without this problem."
1,Don't waste your money,"Absolute waste of money. Uncomfortable, with the worst sound of any earphone/headphone that I've ever used. I tried every eartip with no success. Manufacturer ignored my email. Stick with the Apple iPod earbuds or buy something cheap from a local store."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time!,"I have had an ipod for four years and have had always purchased sony headphones. Unfortunately, my puppy has found ways of finding my headsets. I thought buying the ER6i Isolator headphones would have been more superb than my previous sony. How wrong was I. The bass is painful, the filter replacement is complicated and will be misplaced when needed. The wire is too long and in the way while working out.As for Amazon, this is my first buy and my last. This product took 2 weeks for delivery and was falsely advertised for its delivery time.Do not waste your time!"
2,Not very comfortable....,I expected more from these earphones. You literally have to jam them in your ears to get the right sound. Why can't someone make a decent earphone???
3,not very good,I used these 4 times and they have stopped working so I'm going to send them back. Plus compared them with the stock earphones from my Zen MicroPhoto and the Zen are better.
5,My Favorite,"I had bought these headphones about three years ago and fell in love with them for their in-ear isolating performance. Eventually the sound went out on one of the ears from years of abuse, so I started the search all over for a new set of headphones. After spending a week searching all different brands for in-ear headphones comparing performance versus price, I went back to these once again. They are the best bang for your buck."
3,GREAT! well....1 month ago....;(,"Great sounding headphones...but as many people have witnessed (and reported), Etymotic has decided to let their quality go into the toilet. The first pair I purchased lasted over a year. Sadly.....the latest set lasted a full month. Same problem that COUNTLESS others have listed....the wires break internally and short intermittently so one ear cuts in and out with no sound......disappointing for a $75.00++ set of headphones.EDIT: bought another pair and they lasted over a year (which is remarkable, because I use them ALOT)."
3,Not what I expected,The sound quality is much lower than I expected.I really tried to like themAmazon let me return them no questions asked.
5,6 Years of Excellent Sound,"I'm only replacing them because my first pair was stolen in a robbery. My first pair worked great for 6 years. I wore them all the time, outside, inside, light rain, etc. and they never failed. They seem light and small but that's a good thing for your ears, and I never had the cord even come close to pulling out. These are comfortable, well made and sturdy and I didn't even consider replacing them with anything else."
2,"too ""tinny""","Not for me.I like the sound of the V-Moda headphones I had before much better. These sound cheap, tinny, and have no bass.Bad purchase. I wish I could return them."
5,Study/ travel,"This has been and is one of the best purchase I have made. I originally need ear phone for studying during medical school and fist had purchased ""noise canceling"" ear phones, until I quickly learned the white noise was actually not helpful, if anything distracting. These on the other hand did the trick. I use them everywhere! They are comfortable, work like ear plugs but if you need sound to come through them to listen to lectures, movies, reading, music you can without background noise! Another bonus, I have small ear canals and generally have a hard time with in ear headphones (like apple ear bud) never fitting my ear, with these it was not an issue, they fit great and come with variety of buds from soft to hard and small to larger. Worth the price."
5,"The best earbuds ever made, period.","I've had many headphones throughout the years and, the Etymotic Er6i Isolators are simply the best. Totally discreet, they slip into your ears with many different earplug options. Foam, plastic and rubber tips all come with them. Also included is a carrying pouch, filters that not only smooth out the frequency response, they keep earwax out. A filter changing tool is also included. I pair these with my Cowon D2 and the sound is incredible. They put other earbuds to shame. The sad thing is, after being on the market for almost 10 years they have been discontinued and are now quite rare and hard to find. I was lucky enough to get two pairs each of white and black ones. I see them on eBay going for a minimum of $90. or more used. This is because the experienced audiophile knows the deal with these."
1,Hopefully my pair was defective,"I was excited to compare these in-ear headphones to other such as vmoda and Bose. I was very disappointed in the ER6i headphones, they had absolutely NO BASS. Hopefully this pair was defective because I have always heard good things about the Etymotic headphones."
3,"GREAT sound, but not built to last","These sound AMAZING. Yes, they were worth the money when you do a sound comparison to $20 earphones. BUT, they do not last very long. My first pair, given as a gift from my thoughtful sister, lasted a year. I thought maybe I didn't take good care of them when they first started falling apart. SO I decided to give them a second chance and bought myself a new pair about 1.5 years ago. Just a week ago, the wiring started to break apart and now I have no sound in either ear. This after carefully putting the earphones in the case almost after almost every use. So it has become clear these are not built for a long life. I really loved the sound on these, but decided to try a Bose pair this time. We'll see how they fare."
2,Internal wires exposed at the plug,I purchased a set of ER6i in July and after three months the internal wires are now exposed at the plug. The black external casing at the joint with the plug has broken. This is a disappointment. I sent an email to Etymotic inquiring about a warranty replacement. I could not find warranty replacement information on Amazon even though I purchased from Amazon LLC.
5,Excellent Device,"Great earbuds! Comfortable. Shut out my noisy, annoying co-workers and let me enjoy a peaceful work environment."
4,Etymotic ER6i earphones,"Excellent earphones. Good isolation. Only drawback is the relative lack of bass response. This is the second set that I have owned (my dog ate the first set, seriously) and would buy them again as I find them to be generally well balanced across the audio spectrum. A very good value for the money and probably among the best earphones under $100."
1,Build Quality Stinks,"First set lasted slightly less than a year, the little filters are a pain and an added (very very for what they are) expense the wiring shorted out on one side. Under warranty these were replaced within 8 months the right side shorted out I sent them back the repair department said nothing was wrong ..... Problem still existed, by the time I sent them back they were out of warranty.Sad state of affairs for such an expensive product....I'm done with them."
4,Great but....,"These truly are great headphones, and I've tried them all. I'm on my second pair of them and I am going to have to get a third pair. IT's not because I want a third pair, it's that these headphones just don't seem to last more than a year.Even with the proper maintenance of replacing the filters (yep, you're going to have to buy more from the company if you want them to stay sounding great), the sound has degraded to nearly nothing in the right earbud. Once I could understand but two pairs, each of which I had for a year, failing is a bit much.I recommended these to a good friend who had the same problem of of the right ear going dead over time. Obviously I can't in good concience reccommend these anymore to friends.They are expensive but well worth it. Even with this flaw I'll be ordering another pair. They are that good."
2,Huge Waste of Money!!!!!,"Bottom Line, I read many reviews on these and saw how many people had issues with the total lack of bass........It is true!!! No matter what others will tell you, you have to get them in your ear just right (and with me i had to use the foam earbuds) in order to get any bass at all......I am sending these back and going back to the stock (yuck i know) ear buds.A total disappointment!!!!!!"
4,I like them.,"This is from a non-audiophile. I never thought I'd spend $90 on pair of headphones (especially ear buds), but I have and I think it's worth it. The passive noise canceling is effective. I'm stationed in Iraq and last night I was listening to my ipod and i felt the wall shake. My roommate came back and said that the duck and cover alarm had sounded and because there was a mortar attack. I can definitely hear portions of the music that until now have gone completely unnoticed. (Albums I've been listening to for years) My only complaint is that using them over an extended period of time (Lost DVD marathon) 90 minutes or so the triple flange plugs get a little uncomfortable. I haven't tried out all the plugs though; there are 3 varieties included. This is my first set oh higher end headphones and I would do it again without a second thought. My only concern is if I'm jogging I won't hear the alarms."
4,Pretty good the one time I used them!!!,I recently used these Earphones on an SFO to LHR 10 hour flight and I was quite pleased with the performance.The sound when used with the airline audio visual system was excellent as good as my Bose QC headphones and they really worked well with my Ipod.On their own they made it easy to sleep and I used only the rubber inserts which did cause a little discomfort after a while.I read that the foam ones are more comfortable and I will try them next time.One thing I did find a little worrisome is that it is difficult to pull the earpieces out of the ear canal and the temptation may be to pull them out by the wires which could damage them.All in All I am pleased with the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones and this is coming from someone who does not like earphones that are inserted in to one's ears.Anyone want an unused set of Ipod earphones???
5,Crystal Clear Sound,"The Etymotic ER6i earphones provide crystal clear sound. The only drawback is deep bass response. You have to get a tight fit, which is easier with the included foam plugs, to get good bass response. With that said, they are still worth the money. I also have an expensive set of AKG headphones that produce quite a bit more bass (and I thought were extremely clear and bright) with the exception of deep bass,comparing them with earbuds, the ER6i's blew them away. The sound seems like it comes from inside your skull, you dont have the same perception with In-Ear ear-buds as you do with regular headphones or ear buds."
3,Great sound. Great noise reduction - BAD longevity!,"I love these headphones. I am now purchasing my third pair. In about 9 months. The sounds is great. The noise reduction in unsurpassed. I mean really great. I commute an hour on the bus each way, and I work out at the gym. In both instances I do not want to hear the people around me, and I really do not like having to turn up the volume in my ear to compensate for the noise level around me. Unfortunately, in both previous headphones, the left ear wire died within about three months. First a crackle crackle, and then no sound at all. I am not really hard on headphones, and have had many others last for years. These simply do not. Really disappointing for the price."
2,Headphones go bad,The wires on these headphones get disconnected after awhile and you loose sound in the earphone. This is the second set for this to happen to me after I returned the first ones for warranty issues. Maybe the case that comes with the earphones pulls the wires out? The wires should be designed so that they don't go bad. Be warned.
3,Works best with foam inserts,"Non-foam plugs hurt my ears, however, the foams ones worked well. I like to use these at work, but it is a bit of a pain when you have to get up or answer the phone. This requires you to pull Earphones out.Using the phone inserts requires you to squeeze them so they fit well. Typically, you are not at an area to clean you hands, so you have to roll them with non-clean hands."
2,Overrated - tinny sound quality,"These headphones are good at blocking ambient noise and I use them in a busy office. However, the sound quality is lacking. There is a definite lack of bass and the mids and highs have a very tinny sound. Although the mids and highs are crisper, there is a lack of ""warmth"" in the sound. This may be due to a lack of bass. I'd like to note that I use these headphones with an Ipod."
3,they are good.....but it has no bass,"These headphones sound good for the price, but the lack of bass can be bothersome at times."
3,"Good isolation, Adequate Sound Quality","I purchased the ER61 earphones in order to listen to my iPod on airplanes. I found that, for my ears, only the foam eartips worked and I appreciate that Etymotic provided several different eartips to try. I am quite pleased that I can listen on both prop and jet planes without cranking the volume up to dangerous levels. I am less pleased with the sound quality. I find it tinny compared to the earbuds that come with the iPod. I did adjust the iPod settings without significantly improving the sound quality. They are supposed to have enhanced bass but I don't hear it. I mainly use the ER6i only when there is a high level of ambient sound."
4,ER6i Isolator Earphones,"These are not really ""earphones""; they are ear buds or plugs. They do a wonderful job of presenting your music but they do not compare to real earphones. They do have a noise cancellation option (if you get them in tight enough). For me, they are unconfortable to wear over a period of time. And, I have opted for a nice set of JVC earphones (or headphones)and this is what I will take with me on my trip to the mainland from Hawaii. They fold up, into a carrying case and I am pleased with them...even though I may look like a geek."
4,"OK, but a but expensive","The earphones are definitely cheaper than the ultra expensive Bose earphones / Headphones, but for the quality they offer, they are a bit expensive. But they are surely heads above the other cheaper headphones. It takes some time for you to get adjusted to such clear sound :). You hear each string clearly. The only thing i did not like is that you have to shove the earphones in your ears really tight. It gets itchy after some time."
4,"Fantastic sounding, cheaply built","These headphones sound great - at least compared to my $50 Sony in-ears. Crisp and clear, pronounced, though not too much bass and mids. Unfortunately the build quality is very disappointing... the cables resemble the cheap flimsy ones I got with my mono radio in 1980. They seem like they could break any time. The case is about the size of my iPod; don't ask me why. At $150 I'd expect a little more in terms of quality of the materials. The plug sticks out too far - my Sonys were flat, which made my MP3 player take up a lot less space."
3,Highly breakable,"I bought a pair of these in Oct of 2004, and in May, the right headphone sound went out completely because the wire in the jack broke its connection. I wrote in to the company, and they gracefully sent me another pair, which (today) commenced having exactly the same problem.They're great headphones, but they're not durable at all. Today I will purchase another expensive in-ear pair from another manufacturer, in hopes that those will last longer than 6mos."
1,Don't do thing promised,"The sound quality is below average. Isolation doesn't work as good as the said. The wire is very thin and I doubt it will be broken at any time. While I was in the long time flight(more than 10 hours from US to Asian), this headphone did not work better than the headphone provided by the airline."
1,"Tinny sound, no bass, pain-in-my-ear","I never used an in-ear headphone before and was excited to try, expecting ultimate sound experience and total silence.Now, I am not an audiophile and I am VERY pleased with all my headphones (Koss PortaPro,AKG K26PandSennheiser PX100), however, nothing prepared me to the horrible sound of these.It sounded tinny, it was unpleasant inside my ear and the bass was completely lacking. Maybe my ears are wrong or something but I found the experience really unpleasing.I'll stick to open/closed headphones from now on."
1,not happy with sound quality,"The earbud have poor bass sound reproduction. Fit into the ear is poor. I've used other Sony and v-mode earbuds of similar design that cost half, sounded a lot better at all sound frequency ranges and fit much better . I had to return the buds because they where so unacceptable, I don't do that very often.Beware, sorry for the bad review, but these are unacceptable earbuds in both sound and fit."
1,Tinny Sound,"These are the worst sounding earphones I have ever heard. The sound is so irritating I can't use them. I tried them with my Ipod, 2 phones, & my Stiletto 2. This was the biggest waste of 60.00."
3,"Durability Issues, Great Performance","I was very disappointed that these headphones lasted a little more than one year. Last week, the sound in one of the earbuds went out.I used this headphones frequently and the performance during that time was unparralled. However, after paying for a high-end product, I expected that they would last for at least two years."
3,pretty good but...,"I got this based on the other reviews here. I wanted a set to replace my sennheisers(cx300). the reviews are right about them being clear, they do bring out the details and have excellent noise cancellation but they sorely lack bass. maybe it was because i was used to the bass of the sennheisers. i just couldnt bring out any thump no matter how they were inserted in my ears. i returned them and got a Denon AH-C452K. i am more satisfied with the denons."
5,Listen to the best...,"These are the best sounding earphones/headset I have used to date. They are comfortable in the ear, they block surrounding noise without making you feel like you are in a tunnel and they product excellent sound in all ranges. The ear tips are different sizes for comfort so they fit nicely and you have options of the flange style or memory foam and they are very compact. These are good for running around town, but also excellent on airplanes due to the sound quality and the small size."
4,"Etymotic ER6i's, pretty darn good","I bought these on Black Friday(well, technically Saturday, but they were still available) in 2008. The isolation is EXCELLENT(I can't hear people talking on the bus), the tips seal well and you won't feel discomfort like similar in-ears that have a larger frame. Bass is somewhat lacking(I'm a bit spoiled by bassy cans such as RP-21's), but detail and other stuff like that is good.The only things I don't like(being that I give it 4/5 stars) are that the filters need to be replaced(you are provided an extra pair, and replacements are pricey, going for about $15 for 3 pairs on Headroom), and the cables are rather thin.Overall though, they are solid headphones. I paid $50 for them, so no complaints here, because as of 1/6/09, they cost $76.25."
2,disappointed,"I've given these a try for the past couple of weeks and am disappointed. There's only very weak bass. I have a good seal on my ears (custom molds and everything). They just kinda stink. And the plastic piece on the rear of the right bud has a gap between it and the rest of the housing, allowing what looks like an ear hair or an eyelash to get inside.The sound on my Shure SE110s was noticeably better."
3,"Fairly sturdy, good oiose-cancellation","This is my third pair of ER-6is. The first one was stolen, the second eventually died because the cable fell apart, and the third is my current pair (about a month old).Sound quality is acceptable, meaning I'm used to them.Most headphones have a ""break-in period"" where the user becomes accustomed to the sound of the earphones.I wish they had sturdier cables. I don't care about weight nearly as much as I care about longevity and durability. The cables on these are not a sturdy as I'd like, and I'm tempted to replace the cable with a sturdier one. You also have to destroy the earwax filters to remove them, unlike the older models where it was possinle to remove and clean them.Noise isolation is excellent, though you can still hear people talking (I'd call this a feature).what can you ask for such a low price? It's the noise isolation which keeps me coming back (though the MC5 is a disaster when it comes to sturdiness)."
1,Very poor quality and zero customer service response,"First impressions were good - very small and excellent sound. Isolation rivals some more active systems I could mow the lawn and listen to awesome sound with just a faint rumble in the background. After about 1 month of light use the flexible plastic at the jack split. 2 months later the jack was hanging lose from a completely split joint. Managed to limp by on this for about a year, wires finally shorted and now dead to the world. These were great while they lasted. Got a sum total of ZERO response from customer service, I will never buy from them again."
4,Great Detail,"I replaced my entry level Shure earphones with these ER6i after the Shures fell apart. Brighter more detailed sound than the Shures at about the same sensitivity. In fact, the detail is so good I find myself stopping my workout to listen to them on a number of tracks. Attention getting.They are also, smaller and lighter which makes them more comfortable."
2,"Sorry, but these just don't cut it","I've given these a fair try and tried every possible permutation of eartip style.I know how to use earplugs because I use them for sleeping . I also have excellent hearing and do NOT enjoy a booming bass in my music.No matter what I do , the best I can get out of these is a mediocre , and shrill sound performance. Even when there IS some bass, the mid range is 'flat' and high ranges are harsh, where the same source played through speakers or other external headphones sounds much better.Could be a matter of ear canal shape/size, but at best , buying these will be a gamble for anyone. Be prepared for the trouble of returning them."
2,Not as good as I had hoped...,"...due to the light bass. I am not a bass head, so I wasn't too concerned about the reviews from others about the lack of bass. But this set of earphones was good for only one thing for me when I tried it out: sound isolation. When I have them on, I can hardly hear anything around me. Personally, though, I'd rather have just some more bass for that ""kick"" in my music (I listen to video game and anime music most of the time, and then some techno such as songs by TaQ, and then a little from every other category) and the extra ""crispness"" of higher pitched sound was not something I like either.So, I switched to a UE Super-fi 3. So far it has more bass than the ER6i (I think). I don't think the Super-fi 3 has as much bass as the Shure e2c-g's though."
2,weird feeling,I returned the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones because they have to be jammed deep in your ears to work properly. That effectively makes them earplugs too!icky feeling!
2,Nice Reviews But Poor Sound,"After reading all the reviews and thinking the quality of the sound would be great I purchased these earbuds. Unfortunately, less expensive one's I found have better sound quality. Yet, they do stay in the canal of the ear well and are nice for running or active sports. If you are looking for great sound quality keep searching, these are not it. Sorry, would rather pick up another pair of $20 Sony Earbuds like I already own and save the difference."
2,"Great sound, no bass","I bought these for running. I tend to run to the beat, and the beat just isn't there. The mids and highs are great. I have adjusted all EQ settings, and still just about no bass. On a plane, I would think these would be great. Good sound isolation, not great. I just was sad to hear just about no bass. I have gone back to my Ipod stock headphones. Sound quality isn't as good, but at least I have bass."
2,Not for active people! Very fragile wires and filters!,"I have been through 3 pair of ER 6i earbuds from etymotic in the past 1 1/2 years. They are very fragile, require frequent replacement of the filters (any tiny amount of sweat from activity will immediately block all sound from coming through the filter). These earbuds CANNOT be used for running (I have tried more times than is rational because I did like the sound quality). The wires are not solidly held into the plug pin so going jogging even a few times with them results in at least one bud cutting on and off a few times then complete silence. To be fair, Etymotic was decent about replacing them free of charge during my 1 year warranty, but I am tired of losing my tunes during long runs and having to send them back again and again."
5,Great noise blocking,Once I figured out how to get the earphones all the way into my ear canal without putting too much pressure on the ear drum (which required a certain amount of trial and error) I find that these work better than any of my noise canceling around the ear earphones (Bose and others).
2,Disappointed by Short on one side,"Product had great sound but the design made my ears sore after a short length of time. After a year, one side shorted out. Also, they are some nose made when the wires move or hit each other. Apparently it is a know issue and the upscale version uses twisted wires to each ear to reduce this effect."
2,"Good Comfort, Poor Bass","These headphones fit well, and cut out quite a bit of the surrounding sound, which is why I bought them.I was disappointed, however, in their poor reproduction of low frequencies. There was very little bass transmitted to the eardrum."
1,Very Dissapointing,"I currently use the Bose-In Ear Headphones and love their sound, but had trouble with them staying securely in the ear without constant refitting. After reading the reviews of the Etymotic ER6i Earphones, I thought I'd give them a try, willing to sacrifice some sound quality in hope of finding phones that would stay put.My initial disappointment was with the flimsy look and feel of the ER6i. My ultimate disappointment was with the horrible tinny and shallow sound. I was prepared for less bass response than the Bose, but not across the entire frequency range.I tried all of the tip selections, knowing that proper fit is essential, but even with the smallest tips fit deeply in the ear canal, they just didn't respond. I tried adjusting the EQ on my iPod, but nothing helped.The ER6i phones were in a box and on their way back to Amazon within an hour of receipt. Bummer."
1,"Not comfortable, poor bass response","I followed the instructions on the included pamphlet (pulling on the top of the ear to get the canal to open properly, etc.) Tried all 3 different sizes of the flanged tips, plus the foam, and didn't find any of them tolerable for more than 10 minutes at a time. Furthermore, the bass response is utterly boring. If you like your music to have a bit of presence, and think you're entitled to a bit of it for ~$75+S&H;, keep looking.Finally, the isolation makes it possible for me to hear lots of things I wouldn't ordinarily - the sound of blood rushing through my veins, the action of my jaw if I eat while using them, my esophagus as I drink water, etc. I would think that for the price, I'd get a better sound experience than the whooshing sound of my own blood vessels with a topping of utterly mediocre bass.I have no idea how people can stand these. Will be asking for an RMA soon."
1,not as expected,"I bought this product with high expecations. I read all the reviews and used it accordingly.When I tried it, it had no bass response whatsoever and the overall quality was substantially less than the Apple earphones furnished with my Ipod. Other people tried them without my comment and also thought they were distinctly inferior. In fact they were so awful that I wondered if somehow I had gotten a dud pair. I returned them for refund and Amazon was great about that. Really amazed and disappointed."
1,Might be good if you have the right ears- save your bucks!,"Very disappointing! Although I am sure I get them to seal (I hear a pop when I pull them out) there is absolutely no bass with these. I even got the Etymotic special pad kit (ask them- you get it for free) but this did not help. From what I read from other reviews they do work with some ears, but do you really want to spend this much money if there is quite a good chance that they are unusable for you?"
2,it's not at all like they say it is !!!!!,"thought i paid a bargain price, because of the 50% off pricing with the good reviews on the product.but, it turns out, the product is not all it was cracked up to be.i really don't see too much differnce in quality of the sound or the convenience for the money that i paid for.my recommendation, just get a decent regular, or, even sticking with the original ear phone that comes with most of the product that requires earphone(i-pod, mp3 players, or computers...), you are not missing anything.bottom lime, it's not worth the money to pay too much money for a set of high end in-ear phone."
5,Saved my marriage!,"My lovely and talented wife of 22 years unfortunately snores quite robustly, and I found I could not sleep in the same room, which was not good for our relationship. I listen to audio books every night going to sleep, both to relax and to block out as much as possible of my wife's alter ego.I have purchased and tried out a half-dozen sets of both ""noise isolation"" and ""active noise canceling"" ear phones, attempting to find a way to cohabit in peace, with little success until I popped for the ER6i's. It took a while to adjust to them, but, wow, they DO WORK! Hurrah!The sound quality is very good, they are comfortable to wear with my head on a pillow (not so with headphones) and block out very nearly everything. With the volume on my mp3 player at zero, I hear only my own breathing. With the volume at 20%, I enjoy a good book until falling asleep. In peace and quiet. With my wife by my side.Cheaper and more effective than counseling!"
1,"Wires turn brittle like coathangers, NO customer service","I bought the white 6i based on the advice of a good friend. Initially they worked fine, then the wires got very stiff, I started getting breaking up and I got NO response from Etymotic customer service.I'm much happier with the Sennheiser CX300 that are selling for less than $20."
1,Very Disappointed in Reliability,Thought I'd treat myself to an ipod upgrade. Constant eartip and filter problems in a year. After about 2+ years one side shorted. Something this expensive should last longer and have a much better warranty.
5,"Great sound, okay price--a must for light--weight isolation!","If you hate the bulkyness of isolating headphones or anything requiring a battery amp, then these guys are for you. They are totally light-weight, they don't fall out of your ears like those stupid Shure E-series ones, and they fit very comfortably. If you moisten the flanges and lift your ears while inserting (per the suggestions in the instructions), you get a literally air-tight seal and the sound is unparalled. It sounds like you're right there. Also, in both the subway and grocery store, I heard nothing else and the music wasn't even up especially loud. My roomate has also begun smacking me when he needs something, as I don't respond to verbal call outs anymore :O)"
2,Good at First but Not Durable,"I did my research and the Etymotic ER6i seemed great. When I bought them they worked beautifully--full sound and good noise reduction. But then one side quit working on me suddenly. I thought I might have handled them too roughly--the wires are really thin and it's tempting to pull them out by the wires. So I faulted myself and bought a new pair since I liked the sound so well. This time I was super mindful of the thin cord and carefully removed them from my ears. Nonetheless, one side quit working yet again--this time after only six weeks! Will not go with these again."
3,"cables keep giving out, should i buy a 3rd pair??!","I bought these because I was looking for a pair that would have an accurate fidelity, i.e. no crazy bass or other changes. The sound is great, and the noise cancellation is wonderful. But, the cables keep breaking. After about a year of use, they would give out (as in you can't hear sound from one side). I've gone through two pairs already and the same thing happens. I don't use them in any special way, just sitting in front of my laptop. I don't take them running, etc. So I consider my use normal, and these cables just low quality. I don't think I'm buying a third pair. Time to shop the other brands."
4,Good Stuff!,"I purchased two sets of these earphones, one for myself and one for my wife. We have been traveling extensively and we use them on the airplane. We love them. They are quite, comfortable and easy to store. Most importantly, they have great sound!"
3,mixed feelings as quality fades,"I first purchased a pair of these years ago. At two years, the right channel died. Bought a new pair. They lasted another two years, until mis-placed.The latest pair from Amazon came with a dead right channel, it would cut in and out as you moved your head. The replacements are holding up fine, but I now view these as a consumable. Figure a couples of years use.I like the sound quality, and the fit works well for me."
4,A Must for Noisy Environs.....,"It's true these earphones are a bit thin on bass, but for those who use their portables on planes, trains, and automobiles (ha!)they are a must-have item. The phones fit snugly and comfortably in the ear canal and simply seal out external noise. I use the standard Creative Zen Micro ear buds at the beach or when walking my dog, but when traveling the Etymotics are preferred because they eliminate the ""white noise"" of airplane engines--I even use them when mowing the lawn! Improved bass would garner the 5th star--maybe the ER4s would get that, but not in my budget......"
5,BEST HEAD PHONES EVER,These are the best headphones I have ever had. They pretty much have changed my life... : ) If you like music and don't like hearing the outside world. by these.
4,"Great sound, a little unpleasant to wear","These ear buds have an incredible sound. They do deliver on their promise sounding great. As for the noise reduction, they work prett y well. I had a chance to try them out on my last plan trip, 5 hours each way. You really have to stick the buds far into the hear to muffle the sound of the jet noise, but it does work. They do not eliminate the external sound completely. Also, to reduce the sound, the buds go so far into the ear as to be uncomfortable. If you have an IPOD with the buds that come with it, these are far superior, but also a lot more uncomfortable. Keep that in mind."
4,"good, but not great","these headphones really block out external sound - which is great! The bass is not very strong, but the treble is crisp and clean - very nice. Be prepared to push these headphones really far into your ears, to get the great sound quality they have to be all the way in. If you want a pair of clean sounding headphones that really block out the world around you, these are for you."
4,Good bargain,"Great sound at a great price, though you do have to push the ear buds quite deeply into your ear canal to get a decent bass response."
4,Fantastic Earphones,"Ordering the phones was easy, I had them home in 2 days, shipped from the USA to Europe. I saw a review somewhere saying these were the best earphones available at a reasonable price. They come with an array of plugs, and it took a while to try out the best fitting ones. Disaster struck when suddenly the left channel disappeared, that's why I gave only 3 stars at construction. 2 days later I received the new pair, and so far they have made me listen to most of my music like for the first time. The sound is so clear and distinguished, it's absolutely amazing. Rock and classical music come out as it was recorded, people looking for a bass booster should not buy this.I finally decided on the round plastic plugs, as the ones in the picture suck a vacuum, and the phones are very hard to pull out. Also with the round plugs, they need to be inserted very deep, as otherwise one gets a very thin sound.Overall, I am very happy with them!"
4,Good earphones but a little disappointed,"I bought these to use on my motorcycle and the noise isolating quality of the er6i's are great. They work great for riding, cutting grass, the gym, just about anything. I was disappointed in the sound quality. My pair of $20 skull candies sound better but come no where close on the noise isolation. All in all I am satisfied with these but think they are a little overpriced. If noise isolation is what you are after then give these a try."
2,"Great sound, but unreliable.","I love the headphones, love the fit, love the sounds.But twice now, they've gone out (the sounds stops in one of the earpieces). Eytmotic was kind enough to replace them the first time, but now ~6 months later, they're broken again. I do not mistreat them or take them out of my work office.Please, Etymotic. Make them more reliable."
3,The jury is still out...,"The flanged ear piece makes a nice fit in my ear, although I can see how some people could have problems. You really do have to get a good fit though, otherwise you get a tinny sound and no bass. Overall though, I like the sound a bit more as compared to my previous set of V-Moda Vibes.I did, however, have to return the previous pair, because the left channel started buzzing. Some suggestions were that the replaceable filter may have been lose, but I couldn't seem to fix the problem. Since I was still within the 30 day return period with Amazon, I exchanged them for a new pair. Kudos to Amazon for a very simple return! We'll see if this pair holds up better"
1,Where's the bass?,"I'm pretty much the opposite of an audiophile - but I had invested in a decent quality set of earbuds a couple of years ago from a different manufacturer and thought the benefits were well worth the money. When those recently broke I ordered these because they looked so very comfortable. I was right about part - but the sound was worse than horrible. Tinny, tinny tinny. I would not recommend these to anyone - save yourself the hassle! I returned them and bought another set for $30.00 that aren't quite as comfortable, but even right out of the box (i.e. long before the 24 hour break-in period) sound great."
3,"OK, but doesn't seem to be worth the price","I bought these based on a rave review by a person who uses them to listen to sleep therapy sessions.I haven't found that they sound ANY better than ordinary replacement earbuds that cost 1/3 the price.Like all earbuds, they tend to fall out from time to time. Also, the clip is awkwardly located.The package includes several different types of earbud covers, but provides no information on when or why you should use each type, or how to remove or install them. There's also apparently a little insert in each earbud that you are supposed to change periodically, but the brochure provided no information on that, either.I expected more than I got. I think a $20 (or so) earbud set should do you just as well."
3,Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones,"These cost alot and in my opinion, cost more than they are worth when compared to 15-20$ wally world specials. Sound QA is no better to my ears and bass is lacking compared to some options that costs a 1/3rd as much. I will say the actual ear plugs are great and they isolate noise and fit great. Many would spend the extra money based solely on that but I will not. It's 15-20$ Wally World cheapies for me from now on."
2,they sound terrible!,"These stay in my ears really well while I'm jogging, and they do a good job of blocking out ambient sound, but the sound sucks. Just about anything on my iPod--hiphop, rock, classical--sounds like it's on tiny laptop speakers. Disappointing after spending all that money!"
4,Very clear,"I am very happy with this product, with the only exception being that the base response is not exactly what I had hoped for. The clairity is impeccable! My reason for this purchase was comfort, normal 'bud'phone don't fit in my ear correctly, but these fit and don't feel like you have them in. VERY COMFORTABLE!"
2,Etymotic Research ER6i,"Thse IEM sound very good,very accurate,good tonal balance.They block out noise as advertised. The company is very helpful at letting you try different tips ,so that you can find out what is most comfortable for you. They must get a good seal for you toget any bass and get good noise rejection.The only downside if you use these dayly is the expensive filters and ear tips.I dont use them alot,they are mainly for trips,and mowing the grass.In thse uses they block the noise without having to turn up the volume to ear damaging levels!I rate them as a 4 because of the associated cost of the tips and filters $15 a set!.The company really needs to reduce the prices on these items."
2,Very Average pair of phones - sound quality,"Bought this pair of sound isolating ear-phones after i had lost my pair of Shure E2C. Observing the high average rating of these phones, i thought that i'll give them a try. And I was really disappointed. The sound quality is marginally (if at all) better than the std pair of iPod headphones...and no where close to the Shure that i loved. I do realize that often people say that quality is quite subjective and dependent on individual preferences, but even my buddies didn't like it at all. Although they work great as ear plugs. I guess they may be good for others ...but for me I give it two thumbs down. I might have to return it or gift it to someone and get the Shure again."
2,Great sound that won't last,"Horrible lifetime. The audio is great, yes, but it just won't last. I'm careful and it lasted 7 months. Wires started to become exposed, just like others are saying.You can clearly see the lack of any reinforcements in the pictures... It screams ""fragile"". There are other phones with good audio out there at this price point. Stay away from this one if you value your hard earned money.About the audio... of course I don't need to tell anything. It's very good for the price, like people are saying. Look at good review places that will tell much more than I could."
1,Etymotic Research disappointment,I've used their earplugs for years so I had high hopes for these earphones. They fit the same but sound is lousy...no bass at all. I'd rather mow in silence than hear my favorite songs with no bass.disappointed.
5,Great sound,"I am so happy with these etymotic earphones. I use them when I walk my dog in San Francisco and the street noise is almost completely muffled. I can tell because with the previous earphones, I would have to crank up the volume when I went outside. With these, I realized I was never needing to adjust the volume . I get the full range of sound. Before I was missing the bass and percussion on songs and now I get the full range of sound. The songs sound as good as they do on myNAD sound system. I had to order the small size earpieces from Etymotic and you get six pairs in a pack. They are easy to clean. They have rubber or sponge earpieces. I didn't like the sponge because if I was chewing gum, I could hear the sound of my jaw moving!The earphones are great and I would highly recommend them. They are also cheaper than Shure, another good brand."
2,one huge shortcoming,After a year the rather thin cord developed a short near the 3.5mm plug. The cord is really wimpy and an obvious weak point in the design. The sound quality was amazing however and I might just resign myself to another pair.
2,What a Disappointment,"This was my first high dollar purchase of earbuds, what a disappointment. While reading all about how great the bass was, etc. I was set for something special. It didn't happen. The bass response was totally lacking with all three of my mp3 players. I mean you can jam these things all the way in to your eardrum and it's still going to sound very tinny and weak.I went back to the ole creative earbuds that came with my most recent player and they sound great in comparison. I wouldn't use these Etymotic ER6i's if they were free, much less for $75. Sorry."
4,Much Better Quality and Comfort,I bought these earphones 2 days after receiving my ipod. The Apple earphones were horribly uncomfortable and I had to get something new to use the ipod. I read several reviews in the ilounge and these were some of the lower priced recommendations. The sound quality is pretty good and they come with sponges for extra comfort.
2,"Great Sound, awful build","I loved the sound, they were pretty comfortable, but the clear plastic coating ripped and started coming off one of the earbuds after not too much use, which made that bud work only sporadically. If you're going to spend that kind of money on headphones, they should be better built. I had maybe 3 months of good use out of them before they broke."
3,Not sure if it is that much better...,"After much deliberation and review reading (comparing them with the Shure equivelent) I finally bought these in-ear phones. To tell the truth, I am not sure that they sound the leaps and bounds over regular ear phone. A slight difference granted as they are pushed into the ear canal, but the magical experience I was expecting hasn't taken place as yet.All my music is Apple Lossless encoded on my Mac and therefore on my iPod, so I had hoped for more quality sound. So far 3* is all I can give. Nearly $90 is alot for ear phones with only a marginal improvement over the standard iPod headphones, that does not justify the greater cost than regular $30 Sony or so ear phones. Probably I need to use them more thean the once or twice that I have so far. I will update my review after further use."
2,"no bass, too much mid range","I was extremely disappointed with the overall quality of these headphones. You have to literally shove them so far up your eardrums to get the faintest of bas response that it makes wearing these very uncomfortable. I have a pair of Sony in ear headphones that I paid half the cost and they absolutely blow these away. Easier to get in and out of the ear, more comfortable to wear, and crisper highs with lots of bass. The wires are also very thin and too long on the 6i's. A lot of people may say that the 6i's have a more accurate sound, but if your idea of great sound is all mid range, then buy these headphones, otherwise you are much better off with a pair of Sony's at half the money."
4,"Sound isolation great, music a little flat","Purchased these for cycling. They isolate the road noise very well which allows music to be played softley to preserve my hearing.I found these the best for my use of many, many tested."
4,tricky with iphone,"won't say anything about the sound quality, which is amply addressed by everyone else--but these don't fit in the iphones with recessed jacks unless you do some handiwork with a razor blade. it's actually more difficult with this set of headphones than with many others. i've modded about 5 different kinds for my iphone, and the plastic on the er6i's is the hardest.unlike previous er6is, the jack on these is l-shaped, which i also don't like as much. but then the jack on my previous ones broke (which is why i reordered), so maybe they changed it for a reason."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,i bought these to replace the apple ipod earbuds i got with my mini ipod.they feel a little weird at first... like you're suffocating your ears... but that's how this noise isolation works well... great sound... really clean & crisp... perfect addition to my baby (my mini ipod)pretty cool... so far... seem a lil flimsy so i may be writing up a follow-up review...
2,There is no bass,"These headphones have no bass! This is inexcusable considering the high price. The headphones are extremely comfortable, and the mid and high range sound quality is superb. Without adequate bass, they simply don't recreate the theater experience that Etymotic claims. Don't be fooled - all your bass are belong to other headphones."
5,"The ER6i -- insane IEMs, insane price, insane HD sound....read on...","For those of you who are like me and read just about every review on the ER6i before I bought it, let me say one thing: if you're not an extreme basshead, buy this. The price of this item ($71.63USD when I bought it) was WAAY too low for the quality of this thing. But do make your decision carefully because what the reviews say about the slight lack of bass is true. The bass IS less prominent, but I easily fixed that by applying EQ (a little bass boost) to the songs I own. It's all good. Make sure you get a good seal when using these, aka, INSERT ALL THE WAY.These earphones took my ear-virginity and I'm glad it did. *grin*"
3,Great sound but don't last long enough,"I've owned three pairs of the ER6i and won't buy them again. The sound is excellent--I have no complaints about that. But every pair has had one of the earbud wires break on the inside making them unusable. The last pair lasted only 15 months.While they sound great, it's too much money to have to replace them every year and a half or less. I'm going with another brand. Hopefully Etymotic will upgrade the wires at some point--maybe then I'll be back."
4,great choice,"I liked the sound quality of the ""earbuds"" that came with my ipod, but only an elephant could wear them. They couldn't fit in a normal human ear and kept falling out, and besides-- I needed something to work on my motorcycle. I am very happy with this product. These earphones fit snugly into the ear and won't slide out when you put your helmet on. The fact that they fit snugly in your ear gives good sound even while contending with the noise from a motorcycle.I've already purchased a spare pair and also a pair as a gift."
2,Not designed to last,"Having owned two pairs of these, I can attest to the poor quality of the workmanship. Both pairs lost sound in one of the ears, after a bit less than two years in service. I take great effort in caring for any tech that I buy, so it's disappointing to see this happen not once, but twice."
4,The best upgrade you can make to your iPOD,"These are a great little pair of ear phones and make a huge improvement over the sound quality of the stock apple phones. They can feel a little strange / uncomfortable at first but once you get used to having them in, you hardly notice them. My only quibble is that the cable seems a little on the fine side, so not sure that they would tolerate any abuse. If you have an ipod - BUY THEM- they will open up a whole new listening experience for you."
2,Dissapointing,"From all the hoopla about etymotic, I expected somethingspectacular. They aren't. Very good isolation, but onlyaverage sound. Almost no bass."
3,Not all that!,"Sound is better than average but you have to push the ear buds far into the ear canal. Cord is very long and the ear buds cancel out all other noises so these are more suited for the stationary listener, not something to wear while working out."
1,Did not work for me: no bass response,Etymotic Isolator Earphones ER-6These did not work for me... the bass response was not there even after trying several different ear canal adapters and pushing them in to seat them properly as per the instructions. My iPod earphones sounded much better overall and cost much less. It might be that my ear canals are oddly shaped but I don't think so. Too bad -- the upper range is much better than the iPod earphones.
2,Mostly Disappointed,"I purchased the Er6i earphones based on recommendations from fellow motorcyclists. While the headphones do a good job of isolation and fit under a helmet rather well, they leave much to be desired in the sound department. I should have considered other reviews more carefully when they commented on lack of bass response. No matter what I tried (all buds including the earplug type) the headphones sealed well and were comfortable but lacked full range response. Music just sounded flat and tinny. If you desire strong mid-range sound or any decent amount of bass I can't recommend these headphones. Since returning the ER6i's I have had terrific results molding i-pod style earbuds with silicone (do a search for custom earplugs). I find that this option provides both the isolation and full range sound I was craving."
2,Dont believe the hype.......,"I am a little disappointed with this product.I was expecting more than I got for the price.While they do reduce outside noise, it's only because they have to be jammed into your ear. Taking them out has me worried that the wires will eventually break from this. Overall sound of the music is very clear but the bass response is poor. I like the stock headphones that come with my Ipod better than these."
2,Find something newer,"Poor bass, clarity is great but not enough bass ruins these IEM's. Returned these and got the nuforce ne-7m, they sound nearly the same but with more bass without loosing the clarity. I'm no bass head either. filters will cost you money every few months, and the inserts go in deep in the canal."
2,Sound great but...,"These were given to me as a gift and I still have a hard time justifying spending the $77.00+ for them. These earphones do sound good and when you get the fit correct with one of the three included ear piece sets they really do cut down on the ambient sound around you. I was able to set the volume to 50% of my normal volume levels that I was using with two other sets of headphones.These in-ear earphones do sound good, but you may find earphones just as good or almost as good at a much lower price. For me the value just isn't there to justify the cost."
2,Disappoint with ER6i,"i disappointed about bass performance. Sound quality and clarity is good but basses are really bad.There isn't deep bass, just a clear and weak bass.i read all the instructions about how to put it into my ear for rich basses but it didn't work for me . You can hear all sound with good details tho. Beware bass lovers,stay away from this product."
2,Tin ear,"I was really disappointed with these expensive earphones. The reviews I read were pretty encouraging, but my own experience with these is overall pretty poor. Perhaps it's my player, but other phones sound great. I tried to modify the acoustic settings, but could not produce any bass. They sound tin-y and thin, and while the higher notes are the about best sound for any headset I've used, there is no low end- I eally like a strong bass, and these don't give it (at all)."
3,ER6 vs. ER6i - my experience,"I own both the ER6 and the ER6i headphones. The difference between the two, in my opinion, is very obvious. In my case, the ER6i headphones have much better sensitivity (louder at lower volume) and a 100% improvement in the bass response. The big problem I have with the ER6is is the isolation. I don't have any equipment to verify this, but my guess is that the ER6 has about 4-6dB (a factor of 3-4) better isolation than the ER6i. Don't tell me I don't know how to insert them, etc... - I have owned my ER6s for almost 4 years now (that's why I bought a replacement)and they have far superior isolation. To me, the isolation is more important than the sound quality, and the isolation ratings are listed as equal, thus I give the ER6i headphones 3 stars. Is it possible that I purchased a faulty pair? - possible, I guess."
5,"These work for me, and feel comfortable","I like being able to listen to music without worrying about how much energy I'm sending into my ears. I like the Ipod version ER-6i better than ER-6. I have both, one for work and one for my purse. I found I had to change the filter on the ER-6 more than the ipod version and feel the ipod version is more comfortable. There is earwax involved, so you need to clean the flanges off, but I do beleive that would the case with any earphone in your ear. They are removable for the washing, and you can buy spares.The best part about these earphones is that they do not hurt! And I'm very picky about having things in my ears.If your a serious audiophile, then visit their website. They have a $300 version the ER-4 for very accurate sound reproduction, and their manuals give you effective response charts. The ER-6 versions here are the more cost friendly models."
3,Good sound but shoddy construction lasted only 1 yr,"Well that was a good year, but too short. These ear buds provided one year of very good noise reducing sound for me, allowing me to enjoy my music on the subway train without having to turn up the volume on my iPod and let me save some battery life.But eventually the ribbed flanges hurt my ears a little: I was inserting them so that they wouldn't fall out, which created a vaccuum so that when I pulled them out, they would put a lot of pressure in air of my ear canal. But that wasn't what annoyed me the most; it was the fact that the wiring from the end of the cord was getting loose or something so that I could only hear from one ear unless I held it the right way with my fingers. I paid $100 and I think it was too high of a price for this."
4,Earphones,"I really have enjoyed my Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones. They sound good, but are light duty. I have found my Harman Kardon 730 Noise Isolating Earphones were a little more heavy duty. I found the ear foam a little softer also.I really like the volume control. I use these for bike riding, mowing and working and the Harmond Kardon are stronger. The ER6i are also nice for the price."
4,"Not exactly disappointing, but...","I've been using Sennheiser PX100 headphones for the past few years and I like the sound of them very much, so I expected the Etymotics to be at least as good in terms of providing a full range musical notes. I think the ER 6i's are good phones and create a nice seal to keep the noise out, but they just don't have the bass provided by the PX100s. It may not be fair to compare the two given their physical configurations, but if you look at the retail value of both, the Etymotics should be blowing the Sens out of the water, and they just don't come close to doing that. Maybe you need to spend $250 to get earphones that can rival over the ear headphones, and that might be the major issue here. But for the price I got the 6i's for, I'm not completely unhappy..."
3,Extremely comfortable,"These are the best-fitting small earbuds I have tried. For my ears anyway, they slip in and out easily but stay put, and still provide a good noise isolation seal. With the smaller 3-flange eartip, they insert pretty deeply, which allows me to rest my head on the side without a portion of the earbud jutting out. So comfort-wise, these are great. The sound quality is just pretty good, though. Clarity is good, especially in upper midrange, but these lack extension at the highs and lows, and are generally weak on bass. For comparison, I bought a pair of Klipsch S4's, and the Klipsch's are blowing the ER6i's away with full bass and clear treble. I've broken the ER6i's in for a long period and have tried several different eartips, but the Etymotic sound quality hasn't really changed since day 1. For the price, they're built well, and sound much better than stock iPod earbuds, but there are better choices out there in the same price range."
3,Uncomfortable when sleeping on your side.,I bought these to use sleep music while blocking out train noise. They work fine except the design leaves much to be desired. They stick out from the ear quite a bit so unless you sleep facing straight up the earphones poke quite hard into your ear or smash sideways with hard plastic against your ear. They should be more flat and compact. They are just fine if you're using them awake.
1,Where is the bass?,"I'm not bass junkie, but for God's sake I like a little bass in my music! These earphones offer you none. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nadda. NOTHING! And yes, I crammed them into my ear canals until I practially touched the inner walls of my brain. The seal was perfect. I gave it a week. And still, I heard nothing in terms of bass.Honestly, I do not know what the people who gave it five stars are thinking. Again, I am not a bass fanatic. I do not have monster subwoofers in the trunk of my car or turn my home sub ""up to 11""! But on a bass scale of 1 to 10, these things are practically in the negative digits.Extremely disappointing for a set of earphones at this price point."
1,No bass response.,"Well, I read all the mixed reviews and really wanted these phones to work. You'll notice many of the good reviews are by self proclaimed audiophiles or other ""experts"". Many of them presume if you don't hear enough bass, you either don't know how to insert the product in your ear or don't know good sound. Let me tell you, if I had inserted these things any further in my ear canal, it would have taken a surgeon to remove them. I've been using headphones of all types for twenty years and while I'm no audiophile, I know good sounding from bad. In my experience these things lack any kind of bass output.I tried all the different shaped tips that came with the product and different positions in the ear canal. Nothing mattered. I suspect these phones rely on specifically shaped ear canals. Yes, their clarity was amazing but the complete lack of low end was appauling. They're going back."
1,Disappointed in product,I was very disappointed in the earphones when the soft plastic tip became lodged in my ear. I wound up having to go to emergency to have it removed. The fact that they are not permanately attached to the earpiece makes them unsafe.
3,Disappointed,"I bought these earphones based on the reviews here. However, I am quite disappointed. These earphones have very poor bass sound quality. I tried all 4 sets of earpieces and followed the one guideline for better bass quality (which is, making sure the earpieces fit securely in your ear). If you like bass, do not buy these. They do not hold a candle to the earphones that come with the Apple products."
1,Really disappointed,I bought these headphones because I read good things about them. As soon as I had used them in my hands but it was difficult to be comfortable with them. Included some sleeves that fit very well into the ear canal but little use to hurt. On the other hand though it fits nicely into your ear canal does not completely isolate external noise. For all this I had to return them and buy me SCL2 Shure Sound Isolating Earphones - Clear that were cheaper and better audio and do not hurt.
3,Good enough for normal use but not for listening while flying,"I had purchased Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear earphones because it was advertised to be as good as more expensive noise reduction earphones. While it is good enough for daily use, it does not block that annoying engine noise on airplanes. In fact, I need to bring up the volume much higher to enjoy music from my iTouch (2nd generation). The earphones do fit my ears better than the original ones for the iTouch, however, and does deliver better sound. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a better-fitting earphones under normal use, but if you are looking for a noise canceling feature, you should consider something else."
2,Disappointment...,"I'm not sure what everyone's talking about with these. I bought them based on reviews, and the sound is really disappointing. Could it be I'm doing something wrong? Is there some button or switch I need to flip on these things? Cause the sound is terrible. No bass whatsoever, no matter what the EQ setting on my iPod.And noise isolating? Again, I don't get it. I thought my ear canals were pretty mainstream up til now, but maybe I have fine grooves which let in ambient sound. I'm going to return them and buy something cheaper and better."
3,so-so sound,I like the design but was not close to satisfied with the sound quality. They isolate noise extremely well but the bass is thin and the music sounds tinny. I've had earbuds that cost less sound much better but I haven't had anything sit as snugly and reduce outside noise as the Etymotics. I bought them to wear while riding a motorcycle but I'm going to find something else.
4,"Falanged tips are the key, took me a week to get these things to work right","I bought these mainly because the overall good reviews of it. But once I received them I felt I spent a lot of money on only a mediocre set of headphones. This was because I found the falanged tips, the ones shown on the product, impossible to place in my ears. So i resorted to the foam tips, which are provided, much easier to insert. However, bass was lacking in all of my music and i was largely disappointed. Noise canceling was great though even with the foam tips. But tonight as I decided to write my review I gave the falanged tips another try and I finally found how to insert them correctly in my ear and to my surprise the bass came in! I can now finally feel okay about spending nearly $80 on a set of headphones. The sound is pretty darn good, but I still gotta say it is a pain to get these suckers in right, but once you find it you will be rewarded."
1,Horribly uncomfortable,"I bought these after reading all the reviews favoring them over the Shure e3c's.10 minutes later, I returned them. They dug deep into my ear canal (so far that it took a ton of earwax too). And I found the quality poor. (My cheap sonys sounded better)The e3c's are so comfortable - I don't feel them and the sound is way superior. - go for those."
2,missing pieces,"Love the ear buds! But they sent me a mish-mash of tips and an odd number of some types at that! WTF? I don't have the energy to try to figure out who to contact to get the right tips and don't want to bother. I mean, for the price I paid, I'd like to think that the cheapest pieces would've at least been correct. Oh well, I think I'll give them away and get Bose. No more of my money for these yahoos!"
2,ER6i: don't belive the hype,"I had reasonably high expectations for this product, based on a few online reviews. I will agree that there is a certain clarity and presence to the midrange, but stop there. I am totally disappointed at this product. These could be classified as ""gutless"". There is *nothing* resembling bass here. In fact, they sound disembodied and thin. These do not deliver bass as the recording intended, they deliver no bass. These sound like $9.00 ear buds with a rubber surround. It's as if they took the same cheap transducers and made them into an earplug. The claims of eliminating outside noise are greatly exaggerated as well. They do kill about 15db, but nothing like the claim. I returned these. I recommend Bose ""over the ear"" headphones (really!) or Sennheiser 280HD for far superior performance at a similar price. Again, the ER6i are a good set of $12.00 headphones for $74.00."
2,Just not enough bass,"It gets two stars from me for comfort and clear high sounds. But missing three stars for lack of bass and tangling cords. I tried these earphones for two days and they are big on treble but very lacking on bass. It's not that I like bass more than most...the bass on the ER6i is almost non-existent. The $30 iPod earphones that came with my iPod package were significantly better, except for the fit and comfort. The ER6i phones are very comfortable and fit snugly...unlike the iPod phones, but the sound is all highs and little lows. If you turn up the treble in a factory car radio and turn the bass to -5...that's what it sounded like to me. Oh...and the cords are a mess...tangled every time. This will be the first time I've returned an electronics item."
1,not recommended,"Neither the company who sold me the ear phones through Amazon or Etymotic Research would let me return these headphones. These headphones did not improve the quality of the sound, and actually sounded worse than the regular iPod headphones. I do not recommend these headphones for the price at all."
1,Don't bother,"I wanted to rate this item zero stars but the system wouldn't allow it!I was amazed at how poorly these earphones performed in comparison with the earphones that came with my IPOD Shuffle. I had expected that they would be more noise-blocking at least, but they were not and the general sound production was dreadful. I returned them immediately - don't waste your time!"
2,Great Sound but build quality lacking,I purchased the earphones in February 2007 and one of earpieces quit working in March 2008 just out of the 1 year warranty. They were used less than 50 times and cared for by an anal retentive adult. The sound was good but my ears would get sore from the earpiece after a while. I have thought about buying another pair because I liked the sound quality but don't want to spend $100 on something that may only last a year.
4,Isolates noise like its no-ones business!,"At first, I was a little skeptical to buy noise isolation earphones. Only because the thought of something penetrating my ear so much, might damage by hearing scared me! Ironically, these earphones isolate noise in such a fantastic way, that you end up reducing the volume of your music/ audio device...On standard earphones, you end up increasing volume to isolate noise... but because, that is the primary feature of this brilliant product, 80% of your job is done!Love these. Have been using it for 12 hours now ... and am just enjoying it a lot! Takes about 30 minutes to get adjusted to these, if you haven't used a noise isolation earphone before...Pros: Good sound clarity, good bass, excellent noise isolationCons: You get disconnected with external noises! Not good if you are travelling to a new place in public transit!"
2,"Great sound, poor quality","Sound was awesome and all was great until about 8 months of use. One side cut out. Like the other reviewers, no help from customer service. Great sound but poor durability. Wish they were still alive :("
5,Miniature Marvels,"I liked these earphones so much that I recently bought a second pair for a friend. We both have small ear canals and find most earbuds to be uncomfortable. Wearing glasses makes the kind that hang over the ear impractical, too. But these are tiny, with a very flexible outer surface that forms to your ear and is almost impossible to feel while you're using them. And in case your ear isn't that small, the product package includes several sizes of the flexible ""sleeve"" that you can choose.Comfort was the main reason I gave up on other brands, but I have to say that sound quality is the best reason for sticking with this brand. I thought that all earbuds would sound approximately the same, but these are as good as any traditional full-size earphones I've tried."
1,Disappointed...,"Well, I'm from Brasil and I bought this product while I was on a trip to the US. Decided to order it based upon the reviews from the other users. When I received it, I was totally disappointed though. The build of this earbuds seems very flimsy, and the sound leaves much to be desired, at least for me (and I'm no basshead - I know that appreciation and taste varies from person to person, but for me the sound was very dull).I couldnt return home without a pair of good new headphones, so I ended up buying a Klipsch Image S4 and a pack of Comply foam tips at an airport kiosk which allowed me to try a pair, and I dont regret it. Please, if you're considering buying this headphone, try to find it on a store and try it out first."
3,High functioning but high maintenance,"These headphones work great on the noise-canceling front - I should know as a rider of one of the loudest of NYC's subway lines! I've even used them as earplugs when I didn't have my earplugs on me. The sound is good and they are comfortable enough. The problem? If you lead a relatively rough-and-tumble existence like I do, normal wear and tear causes the squiggly little piece of rubber that covers where the wire meets the jack to come off. This then partially exposes the wires and one will short out shortly thereafter. I've tried to be as careful as possible and usually stored them in the pouch when not in use, but this has happened to me with 3 or 4 separate pairs. I finally wised up and bought the Audio-Technica ones which have a much more protected jack. I'd go with those if you lead an active lifestyle. If ER just corrected this one problem, these would be great..."
1,Not worth the pricetag,Like so many things they were great till they not longer worked. I was always very careful with these because I had never spent that much on earphones. They lasted a year and then one side no longer worked. I wouldn't spend that much on this brand again.
2,"poor fit, sent mine back","For $74, I didn't think this was *that* much of a step up from stock ipod earphones. There is slight improved clarity, but not much bass. All in all I probably would have kept them since for the money, you're not going to find amazing ear canal monitors, but the problem I have is with the tips - none of them work, except for maybe the foam tips (akin to common foam earplug) which will get slowly worse and worse especailly with sweat from the gym, and replacements are $14!?!? forget it. Who wants to be ""rolling earplugs"" every time you put earphones on either to make them squeeze into your ears. ugh."
4,Awesome Collection -- A Complaint Though,"I love this series of games, and except for some slowdown, they are perfectly emulated. The controls are responsive, and the 2d graphics are awesome and sometimes absolutely HILARIOUS! Cool weapons, machines and overall just an awesome collection of games. Well worth the price.The only thing I CANNOT STAND is the high score system. I wish it wouldn't let me continue forever and never penalize my score. It makes me feel like I'm cheating or something. So, I set the continues to 5 or 10 for a challenge. Just a minor complaint, I could always write my scores on paper."
4,BOUGHT SET FOR MY MOM & 1 FOR MYSELF.,I LOVE THESE PLATES VERY THICK PLATES. MY FAVORITE PART IS THE SEPRERATE SAUCE HOLDERS ON EACH PLATES SO FOR FOOD SEPERATERS AM PEOPLE WHO CANT STAND TO EAT AFTER OTHER PEOPLE THESE ARE THE PLATES FOR YOU.
5,We LOVE these plates!,"Unlike most fondue plates that mostly accommodate sauces, these plates have plenty of room for you to put *food*! That means you can prepare side dishes ahead of time to go along with the meats people will be cooking in the fondue pot, and everything fits on the plate like a standard dinner plate. The sauce sections hold plenty of sauce, too. Although they don't ""nest"" well, we have no trouble stacking them."
1,3 Plates Broken - poor shipping!,"Buyer Beware - I paid $36 for expedited shipping for a dinner party this coming sunday for mother's day and I ordered 3 boxes of 4 plates and each box had one plate broken. The box they were packed in only had packing material for two of the four sides and none for the top and bottom. The plate boxes only have cardboard for in between each plate and nothing for the top, bottom and sides. I guess I should consider myself lucky that I got some that were not broken. So disappointed as the plates themselves are great."
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed with my plates arrived with a price sticker from a local department store on them. I guess I should have shopped around more since the price sticker on the plates was way less then I paid! Poor form, Amazon."
3,Great for smaller tanks. Not economical in larger tanks.,We have a 55gal planted tank that we wanted to add some night lighting too in addition to the LED's in our hood. Our water was perfectly clear when I put these in. Unfortunately they were not really bright enough to have any affect. I would guess that 4 or 5 would be required to adequately light our tank. At that price we would be better off buying the LED light kit that comes with a hub and has lights that plug into that.There is also the issue that 4 or 5 of these would require there own power strip and timer.
4,too mellow,Not too many hits on this album and shows lack of concentration and devotion to his music. I hope he's a good family man since that's what he seems to have going for him...
2,too slow to be a mystery...,"This novel starts off very slowly. For me a mystery novel needs to hook you within the first ten pages. ""YGHOM"" is too slow to be a mystery and does not have enough of that ""UMPH"" to make it a good love story. I received an email about the release of this novel and went right out to purchase it....I could have had a V8 or a Mochachino and been more fufilled.I read the first fifty pages the day I got the book, and I was thinking OK, ""when is it going to get good?""The novel just moved too slowly for me to enjoy. Amelia and George work on opposite sides of the legal justice system yet find themselves trying to solve a crime while fighting the attraction they have for each other...typical LMN(Lifetime Movie Network) fare, but less entertaining!Valerie Wilson-Wesley, Terris Grimes, or Barbara Neely, please send Ms. Sneed your old creative writing notes."
5,Hang Time is Game Time!,"This is one of the easiest and most fun basketball games to play. Tons of hidden cheat codes and Easter eggs, simple, fast paced gameplay, it's even enjoyable if you lose! Worth every penny."
2,Does not appropriate to photos =(,1) I need to buy heatsink retention2) Why motherboard on the picture is not the same as delivered motherboard? (less socket on the board for other boards)
2,This is all it takes to be a star crime fiction author?,"Sorry, but I found the writing uninspired, with too many awkward similes (""An erratic breeze, as moist as the inside of an ice chest, rattled among the tree branches."" I kid you not.) The chronology was a straight linear progression from the first page to the last--nothing as challenging as, say, a flashback.I'm usually terrible about figuring out whodunit, but with this one I was a good 50 pages ahead of the protagonist. By that personal standard, not a great story.I like crime novels but don't read many; this one was definitely no standout IMO."
5,Wonderful!,"F is for Fugitive is in my opinion the best book in the Kinsey Millhone series. By the way, I have read A through F so far. In this book, our protagonist leaves the usual setting of Santa Teresa and travels to Floral Beach, a small town, where she is hired to solve a murder that happened seventeen years ago. She quickly untangles a web of emotions and hatred between different characters. It seems like both Kinsey and the reader are in the dark about the events that occured seventeen years ago until we are about 75 percent done with the book. Don't miss this one. It is a first-rate mystery."
4,"""F"" is for Fugitive","Not too bad, I have not read many of Sue Grafton books but, I enjoy her style of writing, I have a lot of friends who enjoy her style."
3,Did not like this one very much,"The only character I really liked in this one was (wink) the Reverend H. Had good possibilities. The plot is good towards the end - when the investigation really picks up. Overall, not so good a story - still, once you have read one Kinsey, you have got to read every single one ... and that's the truth. So read it, and enjoy whatever you get out of it. Better than the Rendells etc. anyday."
3,Murderer on the Run,"'F' IS FOR FUGITIVE by Sue Grafton will keep you guessing until the very end. Kinsey Millhone is drawn into the hunt for a convicted killer who has escaped from prison. Baily Fowler maintains he didn't kill his wild girl-friend, Jean Timberlake.If Baily was wrongly convicted for her death then who did kill the young woman.This one is the most complex of the series as Grafton's strengths to keep us reading continue to grow.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,Letdown After E...,"Paperback: I am reading these in order and if I had read F first, I would not have been so disappointed. I felt like the storytelling went backwards. The character of Kinsey was really evolving through D and E. In this one, Kinsey is away from home, and trying to figure out a 17-year old murder. The suspects are comically flawed and dysfunctional. I only gets an okay from me. I also felt the book was 50 pages too long."
3,You can safely skip this one,You don't miss much if you miss this one. Kinsey is sure one shallow and bitter person...especially about Religion. Makes me wonder whatever happened to Sue Grafton to turn her off so...we're not all that bad...
2,"Used book ""very good"" .... not really","The condition of copy I bought is rated as ""very good"", but it has two dime-size holes right on the cover. It's not ""very good"" by any ways."
4,Frank Aguiar,This CD is great!! I am american and don't speak any Portuguese but I still love it. If it wasn't for my friend I would have never heard it. Thanks Alesandra!!
1,Did not work,"Product came and it did not work, package looked like it was 25 years old. Amazon refunded money with no problem. Because of the age of the product I can not recomend."
2,very poorly reserached; there are better books than this one,"My review will be brief since a multitude of other reviewers dictated my thoughts about this book. I do give Weldon and Ankerberg the credit of doing a good job of research in this book. They analyze Mormon documents and appear to have a sophisticated knowledge of the Momron Church. However, my praise really stops there. The books makes several errors in its abstraction of evidence from out-of-context situations. Often the authors regard minute points in the Mormon faith far beyond their significance. They harp on points that really don't matter in the larger scheme. The result is that one must sort though a mess of writing before coming to a final conclusion. This makes the book very exacting to read. I suggest one reads something else before tackling the arcana these two authors invent."
4,Practical Advice For Artists,Art Calendar Magazine has compiled their best articles from past issues into a business manual for artists. Lots of the articles are written by artists. Advice is still relevant and is the only place to get information from artists that have gone through the process of finding support themselves.
5,Best Booster Seat We've Used,"I love this seat. It stays in place on any chair and doesn't slide around or need to be tied down like other seats. It also cleans up easy because of the material it's made out of and it doesn't have any hidden cracks etc. for food to get trapped in.It is a little lower than other seats I've used, but still works fine. Also light weight and travels easy. It's much safer than the ones in most resturants. I would highly reccomend this booster."
1,Wish I hadn't bought this,"I've had this booster for about a year now and I have to say that I wish I had gotten something else. It was fine at first, comfortable (my toddler is a big kid so we needed something big enough for him) and it stayed put in the chair. After about a month or so, it discolored the wooden dining chair it was sitting on - beyond repair. I'm not sure if this is true only of the green seat. Also, after about six months a crack formed in the side (my toddler is heavy, again, so it could have been due to his size) and it eventually widened to the point that a huge chunk of the seat came off altogether. This is only after 7-8 months of use. I simply cannot recommend this product and truly wish I gone with another seat."
4,Great convenience,"I bought this booster because my son likes to change seats at the table all the time. Our other seat had to be strapped to the chair and was a pain to move. With this booster, he can sit wherever he wants and can carry his booster to another chair by himself. It's easy to clean and he is more comfortable too. Great product and fun colors too!"
5,Cooshie is the bomb,Got this thinking we would use it primarily at friend's houses but its turned out to be really useful in our dining room too where it is now semi-permanently installed. It's relatively unobtrusive when its in a chair and our toddler really loves it as she can climb into it and out of it on her own.
5,Just what you need!,"I like this booster for two reasons. One, the fact that it is soft keeps it from scratching up my dining room chairs. I had a hard plastic booster in the past that ruined the finish on one of my chairs. Also, it is made of only one piece, so there aren't any cracks and crevices in which food can get caught. It's simple design is what makes it such a pracital tool to use."
4,Cooshie Booster Seat,"I bought two cooshie's about 1.5 years ago and loved them for my two boys. I recently purchased my third cooshie for my youngest child and I have noticed that there have been some design changes made. Primarily, the ""octopus"" suction bubbles on the bottom of the seat are now tiny compared to the big suction bubbles on the older model. I'm not convinced that the new suction system works quite as well the older one. Also, unlike the older model this new seat had quite a stench which has taken about a month to pretty much go away. Overall I give this seat a 4 star rating due to the new suction system and horrible smell. It does work and I am keeping this seat since the product is super easy to keep clean and you can easily move it from seat to seat when needed."
5,Cooshie Booster,"As a grandmother, I needed a booster seat that would really be comfortable for our girl: and comfort is what this product gives. Not only is it soft and flexible, but it doesn't slip and slide and is extremely safe. The travel bag is great to take the cooshie when we go to a restaurant - we don't have to use those high chairs or hard plastic booster seats. Thank you for a great product!"
4,"Quinn's Mom, Central Massachusetts","My two year old son LOVES this product, and we haven't even been able to use it as a booster chair yet! He thinks of it as ""his"" chair and carries it with him everywhere. He drives his trucks over it; eats his ice cream cones in it; and basically always leaves it underfoot. It SEEMS to sit well and solidly on our dining room chairs . . . if we ever eat there to see if it meets its original intent, I may update this review. This is the third booster seat we've purchased, however, and it's the only one he'll let near him. So far, so good."
1,They may not slip but they may ruin the finish on your chair,"We bought two cooshie seats and thought these chairs would be great.In most respects they are. The problem we had after ony three days of use, is that the seats actually left permanent marks on the finish of two pretty expensive chairs. The paint was marred by every dimple on the bottom of the cooshie seats. ... . My suggestion; if you have chairs with a painted finish that you are hoping to protect, do not buy these unless you plan to put something between the cooshie and your chair seat which would defeat the non slip feature."
5,How does prejudice happen?,"All Blood Is Red ... All Shadows Are Dark! is about behaviors that condition and dehumanize people into commonly accepted, rigid racial categories. A mixed-race family from Cleveland, Ohio, describe some of the issues that present themselves to such a family as theirs."
3,Oldie but goodie,Movie is one of my favorites. Quality of picture is a bit dark due to age of the production. A good movie for the family.
4,western,I normally don't like westerns but this will go in my collection of the few westerns I have. Thanks for sending it so promptly. Dana Andrews is a favorite of mine but Hoagy Carmichiel is also one. I have looked for this for the about 40 years because of the songs in it. Ireta C.
4,A Plot Driven Western,"I didn't have much in the way of expectations when I started to watch this film, so I have to say I was pretty surprised by how good it was. Dana Andrews stars as a cowboy/businessman in 1850's Oregon who is in love with Susan Hayward, the fiancee of his friend, a reckless gambler played by Brian Donlevy. Andrews has to look out for Ward Bond, a violent wanderer who seems bent on killing him. Toss in some Indians, beautifully photographed scenery, other love interests and subplots, and you have a good story that ties all of the elements in together, providing enough action, drama, and romance to keep any viewer satisfied. Plus you have Hoagy Carmichael moving about singing several songs. What more could you ask for?"
4,Create harmony in your surroundings through Feng Shui.,"Livining in harmony. Somehow in our city apartments or oursuburban houses. Amidst the clutter and clatter that islife, to be at peace...to have our lives run smoothly....Isn't that what we want? Feng Shui master Lam Kam Chuenexplains (and doesn't it make sense?) that much of our innerand outer disharmony comes from the physical environmentsthat we create: what colors we paint our walls, wherefurniture is placed, whether we live in a house facing anintersection. Starting with a clear explanation of theproperties of yin and yang: the fundamental forces andenergies (the seasons, the animals, the directions, etc),Master Lam presents the fundamentals of arranging yourhome (and thus your life) in harmony with yourself andwith the universe."
1,Taking advantage of the newbies,"I was intensely interested in Feng Shui and I wanted to know all about it. As a newbie, I didn't know what to look for so I just searched on ""Feng Shui"" and found this book, _The Feng Shui Handbook_. I also ordered another book by Simon Brown, ""Practical Feng Shui"", which also has its faults, but not as many as the _Feng Shui Handbook_. In this book there are too many general things mentioned, which don't tell you anything about the unfortunate placements of bathrooms and so forth, or directions at all. The only thing I got out of this book was the story of the turtle, the dragon, the bird Phoenix, the tiger and the snake in the middle, so if you are willing to pay money for just that, then go ahead and buy it. But i think it is just another newbie...Feng Shui wanna-be to gain money off you."
3,I Knew I Loved You is Great!,"I Knew I Loved You is one of my favorite songs. I don't know about the other two. But if you like the title song, it's worth buying."
5,Beautiful Music,"As a fan of 9th Wonder, Pete Rock, DJ Premo, Jay Dilla, and a few others...I can honestly say that THIS IS HIP-HOP !!! When I initially saw Samurai Champloo, I knew that there would be soundtracks, and that I absolutely had to own them. ""Battle cry"" is an awesome track ( though like someone said, lacks great sound quality). I also agree that the end theme is less enjoyable w/out the video. If you like the afformentioned producers, you will enjoy this album. Nujabes and Fat Jon are two absolutley brilliant producers/musicians. This album doesn't sound like anything on the market today, but it gives you that REAL hip-hop feel and chilled out vibe. Perfect ending to a stressed out day of work and/or college. This is not just for hip-hop heads, it's for music lovers ! Check out Modal Soul too...peace"
4,Old School Gaming,This is a great game. It is hard so for you hardcore gamers this will still provide the challenge you need. The graphics and sound are what you should expect from a PS1 title. Hope you all enjoy it wish it was longer tho..
2,So-so performance,"After reading some of the reviews, I wonder if I listened to the same CD as the reviewers. Live at Benaroya Hall had some good songs on it like like Immortality, Nothing As It Seems and Black. However, I didn't hear anything great and Pearl Jam's unplugged CD pales in comparison to Eric Clapton, Nirvana and Korn's Unplugged CDs.I enjoyed Man of the Hour.My issue with the CD is Pearl Jam played their soft (downsides) songs acoustically - big deal! Daughter's soft anyway. I would have been more impressed to hear an unplugged version of Go, Alive, Dissident, Once. Mix it up. That's what makes a great unplugged CD.This is not their best CD. Nothing Pearl Jam will ever do will compare to Ten. Pearl Jam peaked on their first CD.I have a question. How many live / acoustic CD's does Pearl Jam need to make??? Live on Two Legs was very good. Do we need 30 more live CDs? I saw them once, and I was kind of disappointed, but that's unrelated to a review of this CD."
1,terrible set list,This is a bag of garbage songs LIVE. Only one goddamned TEN song!!! ONE! The rest is just radio friendly Pearl Sham at it's worst. God aweful set list.....
2,Boring.,"Oh please, does'nt anyone find Eddie Vedders singing really irritating and annoying recently?Thats because ever since the Binuaral album Eddie Vedders singing has lacked the emotion that it used to which makes this album very boring and tiresome to listen to. Shame"
2,more boring mediocrity,"I hate to say it but I found Live at Benaroya Hall very dull.Eddie Vedder's voice isnt what it used to be at all.The covers are just boring.Too many songs from the mediocre,parody-itself last two albums.And I guess that to keep from people forgetting them in this long down time (that has seen Pearl Jam being dropped from their record label aka Ten Club releasing this,Vedder becoming a pappa,etc)we will see a lot of Live albums like this,greatest hits,rarities.Anything but a good,strong new album."
4,One of the best live album of Pearl Jam,"This album includes some of the best and rarely played ""slow tempo"" songs of Pearl Jam like the song ""Man of the Hour"", ""Around the bend"", ""Fatal"", etc. I don't give it five stars because they didn't play some of my favorites songs like ""All those Yesterdays"", ""Nothingman"" or ""Hard to Imagine"".With this performance Pearl Jam reaffirms that is one (or the only) of the best bands(in concert and studio albums) in the last 13 years."
4,A decent knife for the price,"They aren't kidding--this thing is razor-sharp. It needed no tuning up before I used it for the first time. The handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight... which is unfortunate, because I like the weight for chopping. But the hollow-edge design is wonderful--the mushrooms and onions I sliced up were thin as paper, and didn't stick to the blade. I'd recommend it."
4,good value for the price..........,"For a stamped steel knife this is quite good. Sharp, decent balance but no, even though a hollow edge santoku veggies don't effortlessly slide of the blade. Well you can't have everything for under $60. If you cannot afford a hand forged Shun--which obviously I could not-- this is a good choice."
4,"great piece of knife, but........","I got the knife 2 weeks ago and it really works great, very sharp blade and easy to use. The only thing I noticed is the part of its description that anything you slice or chop doesnt sticks on the blade because of its hallow edge, this is not true because I always slice tomatoes and it really sticks on the blade I have to swipe it down with my index finger to get into the bowl. But the quality is really great, I just hope this would last for a long time!"
5,One of our favorites,"My son loves Spot and this is one of his favorite Spot books. There are balloons and animals in costumes, which make him giggle."
3,Not what was pictured,It is a good board but it is not the one that was pictured. The board pictured was a larger board with a metal clip. The one I received was smaller and had a plastic clip. Also the pictured item had multiple markers and an eraser where as the one I received only had a marker.
5,Visionary resource.,"Teaching Compassion harmoniously integrates ambitious vision and practical, easy-to-use examples of how to implement this vision in a variety of teaching contexts.The author deftly treats a topic that could easily dissolve into vague ideals and wishful thinking for our nation's children and future, and synthesizes a solid curricular platform based on the her own classroom experiences.Teaching Compassion also provides an original and effective way for teachers to address some of the rising social issues of student violence and accountability. In the context of an ever increasing number of school shootings and incidences of shocking violence, Teaching Compassion is not only a book of fresh new curricular ideas for the home and classroom, but a viable means of addressing some of our most grievous societal woes."
2,Bird Feeder,Product of good quality however birds fly into the window and do not have room to perch on the feeder. Not the greatest.D Hartman
3,"It works, but...","This bird feeder is attractive, sturdy and works well, but the seed flows out much more quickly than my last birdfeeder and it empties fully in about 4 hours, which means I am spending 3-4 times as much on bird seed. Not sure why it is designed this way, but would prefer a slower feed. The birds love it and it is covered with birds all day long, of all varieties as I use black sunflower seeds."
2,Cardinals don't fit,"I bought this because we have two cardinals (and some pigeons) that regularly come to our apartment windowsill to eat. We love the cardinals but could do without the pigeons, so we decided a window bird feeder would do the trick. I bought this brand based on the great reviews, some of which said cardinals used it. I have had it up for months and NO birds use it. But the main problem is, even if they wanted to, cardinals are much too big to land on this thing (don't know where they got the image from! Must be a miniature cardinal).Otherwise, it is good quality, attractive and is solidly attached to the glass, which is great. It is perfect for finches and very small birds, but if you are looking to feed cardinals, forget it. And if anyone knows of a good-size window-attachable bird feeder for CARDINALS, please respond!"
3,Suction Problems,This bird feeder has fallen from my window several times. The suction cups don't seem to be particularly strong or ideally positioned on the feeder.
2,Nice when it stuck to window,"It seems that as soon as the temp changes at all, this thing falls off. We tried rubbing our hand oils on it, wetting it, everything. No luck. It never stayed up for more than a week... :(."
3,Where are the birds??,I can't give this a low rating as it's only been 5 days.. maybe I need to wait longer??? There are birds everywhere outside but NONE have landed on the feeder yet! Ugh..
4,Love this feeder.,"I bought this feeder for my boyfriend for our anniversary because he loves birds so much. That was 5 days ago. The first bird showed up the next day, and today, there were 6 or 7 birds trying to get in on this! I'm sure that it depends on your area-- we have a tree right outside our window, so that helped. But the point is that the birds aren't afraid to eat from it, which is what I was worried about.The suction cups work great, even with three regular sized birds on it (one was sitting on the roof... cute.)A note about that-- I do with it were a little bigger, in hindsight! It can only really fit two birds on it at a time, maybe three, especially if they're little. Bigger birds might have a little trouble landing because of the roof; I've noticed they have most success flying up from below. But they will try, and they'll figure it out!Long story short: GREAT product, but it might be fun to have one that fits more birds."
4,These were purchased as gifts,These were purchased as gifts and I have received some nice thank you notes in return. Appear to be well made.
1,Not as good at it seems!,Although this sounds like a great idea...it's not. These connectors make the strollers too wide to fit through even doors accessible to wheelchairs. The stroller's wheels get all hung up on one another in the middle every time you make a turn. I thought this gadget would save me from having to buy an expensive double umbrella stroller. Since I gave it a good try the strollers are gently used and cannot be returned. Now I'm out the price of two strollers and the connectors.
2,Works great . . . if you have the right strollers,"These connectors work great if the frame of the strollers is made of circular steel tubing. But the frame of our strollers is oval tubing. As a result, the connectors do not provide a tight fit around the frame, and we ended up with a very loose, wobbly connection. The moment we tried to navigate over anything other than a perfectly smooth tile floor, the connectors popped open from the strain."
3,Work fine,"These work fine, but in order to keep the wheels far enough away that they don't tangle, it won't get your strollers close enough to go through most doors. Great for hooking your umbrella strollers together for a walk through the neighborhood or park. Not so great if you're thinking you'll use it as a side by side stroller at the mall unless they have big doors."
3,stroller connectors,"The connectors worked fine but the shipping was more than the items themselves, absolutely RIDICULOUS, for some small plastic parts shipping was almost $20.00. Had my daughter not needed them for triplets I never would have purchased them."
1,Did not work for us!,When we received these we followed the easy directions .... unfortunately the strollers slid all over the place. We have the first years Jet stroller and the front wheels do not lock so they were always getting tangle up. It may work with strollers that have wheels that lock!
3,ok product,"bougth this specially to use at the airpost, were taking an international flight with lots of lay overs. this is bulky and works well only if the 2 strollers are identical. i do use it sometime locally but would not have spent my money on it."
5,Great,When I am shopping alone with my two little girls...these save the day. I no longer worry about how I am going to get around the mall
1,THESE ARE MORE WORK THEN THEY ARE WORTH,"I BOUGHT THESE TO GO ON UMBRELLA STROLLERS. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. THEY FIT LOOSE AND THE STROLLERS WOBBLED. THE WHEELS DON'T TURN AT THE SAME TIME, AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PUSHING AND PULLING AT THE SAME TIME."
3,stroller connectors,"These are easy to put on and take off. They work well to connect two umbrella strollers. The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long. They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers. I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection."
1,"may work for large strollers, but not umbrella strollers!","I have a double jogging stroller, but wanted these for two unbrella strollers incase we went on a road trip bc double strollers are large and take up our whole trunk. My family and I went to a very large mall and I went to put these on two umbrella strollers, did not work, wobbly, one would go forward, then the other, it was just awful.. Great idea, BUT it would work much better if it would cross all four bars under the handles. Now, I have absolutely no use for them.."
2,Not for use with 2 different strollers or if you are in a rush!,"I bought these and am returning them. I'm sure that they would be fine if you had 2 of the same strollers and didn't have to separate them once set up. One of my strollers has oval tubing bars and the other one has round, and I couldn't get the connectors to close. As well, they are a little tricky to separate (I tried doing this before trying to attach to the stroller) - I wouldn't want to be somewhere needing to separate them quickly, especially with 2 kids to watch!I also bought the Munchkin Stroller links which seem to work great (attaches 2 different strollers) and much easier to un-attach! I will review this one after our trip."
1,It doesn't work,"This device will not stick to your dashboard. But that is not such a big problem, because the compass doesn't work. When you are driving straight north, it says you are going north-east, and so on."
1,Does not Glow,This compass does not glow in the dark. It also fell off the windshield of my car and shattered on the pavement the first day I had it.
3,6 YEAR OLD,"It's ok, but the problem is the back of the kitchen is cardboard and it falls out of place alot. Basically everytime my daughter would try to put items into the cupboards the back is cardboard and would fall out. It also does not stand well. My daughter played a short time with it and hasn't touched it since."
4,Light weight and easy for travel... but be careful!,"This is a great product for bigger toddlers who have outgrown the highchair but still need a boost. It's great for travel and is easy to clean. Because there are no straps, it's great for taking out to eat instead of having them sit in the dirty booster seats in restaurants. However, BE VERY CAREFUL when your child is in this seat. It moves around fairly easily and a wiggly toddler can certainly pitch it off a chair without too much effort. It would be best used on a chair with arms or side rails, but on a kitchen chair or stool with only a back and no arms, you have to be at your child's side at all times. I have also found that it's very slippery on leather covered seats and better on solid wood (not secure, but less slippery). Very easy to clean and makes a nice outside seat on the ground for going to watch a game or have a picnic. Just be careful when they're sitting up high with no side support."
1,Wrecked after a year of use,"This booster is very comfy and many of my friends had this, however, my 3 yo son is a wriggly kid, and he broke apart this booster so there are large fissures around the top of the seat. Perfect for tons of crumbs to fall through and making clean up a nightmare. I saw one of my friends' Cooshie boosters and she had to put duct tape across the fissures to hold the seat together. I emailed the company and TWO MONTHS later they wrote back and asked for pictures. We'll do so and see if we can get a refund, as it's appalling that a booster seat that cost this much did not last very long at all!PS - we did get a replacement booster seat, but now have a different booster for my son while waiting for the replacement. I guess we'll keep it for the next kiddo."
1,MATERIAL IS UNSAFE,"This product is made from a foam-like material which a toddler can break or tear off. We have two Cooshie boosters and both have fallen apart. Also pieces of the foam have been chewed off, becoming a serious choking hazard."
5,A good tushy cushion!,"I have a green one for my 5-yr-old, and she loves it. Soft, easy to take off and put on (no straps), wipes clean (no nooks and crannies). When my 2-year-old is 3 and a little more trustworthy about staying in his seat I'll get him one too. For now he still needs his safety belt."
4,Better than the tray booster seats,"For the older toddler, this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays. The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair. The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs. However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony. It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table. Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl. The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair."
2,Starts off great - but BEWARE,"We ordered two of these booster seats for our children. With the high price tag, we expected them to last through all four children. However, after two years, they both ripped. The problem is, if your child likes to get down from the chair by him/herself and you don't actually pull the chair back for them to get down from the front of the seat, then they have to slide over the edge of the booster. After awhile, it will tear. The entire side of both boosters is now gone. They still work but they look horrible. I would recommend a booster without the sides (which is what they turn into!)."
2,cooshie booster seat,"Our toddler never liked this product and hardly ever sat in it. It looked like a good solution to our home dining problem, but it didn't help us."
5,Great Booster Seat!,"This is the best booster seat we've ever purchased. It sits firmly on any chair, it's very comfortable for my 3 year old and there are no clumsy straps to deal with. It's also very easy to take along wherever you go. We would recommend this product to anyone with toddlers who eat at the ""big"" table!"
4,Booster for kids.,My twins really like this booster. It is comfortable to sit on and it does not slide around on the chair. It is easy to clean and we can bring it with us when we go on vacation.
4,Nice seat,"Nice product. My 2 year old likes this booster seat. Side and back rails seems to be a little low, but that might make the booster too bulky. As it is, it feels a little on the bulky side already. Nice support on the seat and grips firmly on chairs. Very good product overall."
5,Good for even older kids!,"My twins are 6 years old and have been sitting in these boosters since they were three. They are old enough to sit at the table just fine, but a little short for their age, and our chairs are a bit low for our table, so these are just great. They don't feel like babies, but they're nice and comfortable. I'll be buying one for my almost three-year-old next month. My sons have blue and green, I just wish there was a pink or purple for my daughter!"
4,Great Booster,"This is a great booster to use anywhere. We use it at the kitchen table as well as at the computer for our 3 year old. It is the perfect shape and material, very comfortable. One thing to note: make sure you put a towel or something under the booster if you place it on a painted chair. The material it is made with adheres to the paint and you are likely to pull the paint right off of the chair."
5,A must have,"Our daughter is almost 2- and the highchair was getting in the way more than anything. We found this chair and bought it immediatly. It sits onto our exsisting chairs and does not slip or slide off. She loves being a big girl now and sitting at the table. Its easy to clean off and very durable. We had some of the other boosters for our sons but they were never able to slide them under the table, so the chairs stuck out. Glad we found this one."
4,the only booster my toddler will use,"Love this booster seat! My independant 2 yr old would not use anything else until I found this seat. He was over the high chair and other boosters I tried quickly and wanted to be a big boy. We have had luck with this seat for 4 mos so far and is nice that there are no straps so he can change chairs at the table if he wants to. Easy to clean with no hidden crevices, etc. Definitely worth the little bit extra it costs."
1,terrible product,This product ruined my new wood diningroom chairs!It sat for a week on my chair and left a shiny residue that couldn't be cleaned off.I only wonder what is coming off on the child that sits on it.It is made by baking it in an oven in a mold.They say it is safe but I wonder!!!!
4,safe but sticky,"This is a very stable and comfortable booster seat. Our problem was that, somehow, it dissolved the finish on the wooden chair it was placed upon. Make sure you put some kind of barrier between the seat itself and a wooden finish. I suspect that there was some moisture between the seat and the chair. The damage over time was severe."
5,Great duvet cover!,The flannel is good quality- nice and thick but very soft. The color is exactly as it looked in the photo. Perfect for cold winter nights.
1,All organic??????,"Perhaps the company should reconsider rewriting its promo for this product. The ingredients list reads like a periodic chart of the elements, INORGANIC elements, that is! Carbon was mentioned, so I guess the company can be credited with not being totally deceptive."
5,Heavy duty for lots of drink blending,"This is your basic heavy-duty blender jar. Thick, solid, made for the party animal. You can run it through the dishwasher and it comes out sparkling clear, unlike the plastic jars that get all scratchy and filmy after use. It is what it is, a glass vase with a handle."
4,Glad I didn't have to buy a new blender,"The jar fit great into the blender and I was so thankful I did not have to purchase a whole new blender. The lid from my previous blender jar was a bit snug, but able to make it fit."
5,Barb,The jar was the correct size of the one I had broken. It arrived in a very timely mannor and up dates were given/ or I was able to check on the status of the merchandise until it arrived---I was impressed.
1,A very poor fit,"The hardware (collar, O-ring and blade) and lid from my Hamilton Beach blender didn't quite fit the jar; it was very easy to cross-thread the collar, causing leaks, and it usually leaked anyway when pouring from the jar.I unwisely handled the thing by the collar the other day, and the jar popped off and broke. I'm just going to buy a new blender now."
5,Metronome Magazine reviews Nothing Yet's new cd,"Metronome Magazine, a music magazine in it's 18th year of reviewing all kinds of music, reviews Nothing Yet's new cd:""Hard driving rock and roll bordering on post-punk mayhem is what Nothing Yet delivers on their new 5-song sampler. The front cover of the CD sports a GI Joe doll (I think) with rippling muscles demanding, ""give me the clothes and the keys to your bike."" Wacky and wild, Nothing Yet imparts a reckless rock & roll attitude that's clearly addressed as good time party music."""
2,It could of been great!.,"I was actually dissapointed in the movie after waiting almost 3.5 years to see it after I had read the book. With the acters they had picked, that was their first mistake. And with the money and time they had to do this movie, it could of been better then Seven, but NO!. They did not hold you as the book did, and they even had that as a guide to go by. They missed putting in some of the best parts of the book into the movie which is why it held a person in the grip of terror. I can say this perfectly honestly, if I had the money and the actors, I could of made this movie ten times better than Seven."
1,quadripelegia for the masses,"Well, this is a bad movie in more ways than one: sense one: it has nothing to offer, at best. Imagine a wattered down version of Seven, add a lame, literally, version of Silence of the lambs, and then any assorted B crime flick, and then take it down a few notches.It is beneath contempt. If you like it, you don't like good movies. Which is OK.Case and point: man (DW) who can't move arms or legs, is able to defeat a man who has control of his limbs and a GUN in ""hand to hand"" combat ( I use this term loosely). If this sounds like a good movie to you, rent it , live it, love it.I felt the need to purge myself. DW has stooped to new lows. This movie is so bad I feel soiled writing about it. Any who like it should hang their heads in shame."
1,Does not play on any DVD player. Only plays on HD DVD players.,"My wife bought it for me for christmas and did not notice that it clearly stated that it only plays on HD DVD player. I really like this movie and was looking forward to watching it!!! This product should not be offered for sale since the average customer would be wanting a DVD that plays on PS3, DVD, etc players. Since the item was opened we could not return it."
5,My Favorite Denzel Washington movie,"I usually run as fast as I can from any type of horror movie and this, in some ways, qualifies as that. And, I know everyone's favorite Denzel Washington movie is probably Philadelphia and I certainly loved him in that. But, there is something about his character in this movie and the way he interacts with the Angelina Jolie character that always draws me in so I want to go back and watch it over and over again. This was the first time I'd seen Jolie and, frankly, since then I've not been a big fan having never gone to see a movie because she was in it. But, again, there is something about her performance in this film that gets to me. It's a very subtle relationship that develops between the two (Washington can damned near make love with his eyes) and I loved the ending. Well, of course I didn't want the nurse to get killed. Glad to see the jackass police detective get his though."
5,Can I give it 6 Stars?,"An outstanding film, The Bone Collector, brings to the screen the story of a retired detective as he directs police efforts to tackle a particularly nasty serial killer with an affinity for bones...There are hints of Seven, Resurrection and The Silence of the Lambs, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Ed O'Neill (!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, The Bone Collector is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"
1,Saw off her hands?!?!?,"I love the movies. And I can pretty much suspend my disbelief for anything. But when a poorly scripted movie like THE BONE COLLECTOR tells me that a female cop walking the beat is going to be pulled from her position -- because she took some pictures of a crime scene with a disposable camera which are supposed to be phenomenal shots -- and made an instant crime scene investigator ... COME ON! Top that off with the fact that Lincoln Rhymes keeps making her go into these blackened areas where a killer may or may not be without any backup.... And top it all off when he tells her he doesn't want forensics to mess up the crime scene and he needs the handcuffs that are on the dead victim, ""I need those cuffs. Saw off her hands.""WHAT?!? That my friends is messing up the crime scene. Since when is a beat cop better at that job than professionals who have trained for years at it?What a waste of talented actors.If you want to see the BEST serial killer movie, rent SE7EN."
3,"Not A Classic, but OK","This film had some good performances, particularly Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, and for people like me who did not read the book, it was suspenseful and interesting, but I agree with many of the other reviewers about the ending. I did not remember seeing the killer earlier in the film, though my father, who watched it with us, claims to have remembered him. The killer's motive seemed absurd too. Still, I found Bone Collector to be watchable, and for fans of the genre, it is worth seeing. Ultimately it is no Silence of the Lambs, and you will not need to see this film more than once, though a second viewing might be in order if you really need to see if they show the killer earlier in the film."
2,Not worth buying on Blu-Ray,"This is an example of a DVD master disc slapped onto a Blu-ray disc, with little to no extra effort placed into it.The film has not been remastered from its DVD format, therefore the quality of the picture and sound is the same as the DVD.Spend less and get the DVD version, which is basically the same thing.Blu-ray is still an iffy format and it's dubvious whether it will or not reach the adoption rate of DVD any time soon."
1,"What a complete joke, and a waste of Denzel Washington",This movie is such a complete joke. It must have been written by a 15 yr. old. I love to watch Denzel Washington in most of his movies... but NOT THIS ONE. I cannot believe he agreed to sign on to this mess. I am almost at a loss for words to describe how bad this movie is to watch. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.
1,Rob,I cannot comment on the the film. It would not play in any of my three DVD players and two computers.
3,Gross,"The climax wasn't quite what I had hoped for, it should have been a surprise with the ultimate gross out over all."
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"NOT WORTH REALLY WATCHING I WATCHED THIS BECAUSE MY SISTER LOVES STUFF LIKE THIS,,,, IT WAS BORING FROM START TO FINISH AFTER ITS DONE YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH THE MATRIX AGAIN TO WAKE YOUR BRAIN UP!!! IF YOUR THAT BORED JUST RENT THIS MOVIE!"
2,So-so.,Denzel is his usual brilliant self. The director had no idea what he wanted to do with Angelina Jolie's character. The plot is muddled and the dialogue is ridiculous and trite.Rental only.
1,Poorly done,"This Movie would be enjoyable if it wasn't so dark( the movie is shot almost without light, or in post it was darkened...) And the audio was a little more consistance in volume. Background sounds and music are louder than the actors. Angeline looked like she needs a few nights sleep... Buy this one at your own risk!"
4,Horror,The Bone Collector is an actual pleasing supensef- ul film. It has a good cast. And the effects were awsome. Get this title for aa good scare. I was dissapointed it didn't have enough blood in it though.
2,Endlessly Cliched,THE BONE COLLECTOR (1999) * * High calibre cast give good performances to no avail in this endlessly cliched suspense thriller. Never misses an opportunity to strictly stick to formula.
1,Knock-Off Plot with Horrible Ending,"The movie has an honorable premise, but ends up as a contrived typical horror film. The suprises are kept to a minimum, where there are many places where one could put a great scene. And the ending is absolutely TERRIBLE! If you do purchase this film, turn it off before you get to the final scenes with the killer. You will be much happier!"
2,Waste of good actor's talent.,I like the type of movie that Bone Collector was supposed to bebut it doesn't live up to it's counterparts like Seven. I'm notsaying that it's not worth anything but don't expect too much from this predictable movie. It's worth watching when you've done a full weekend of partying and your mind is completely fried...
3,Intelligent but unrealistic,"The cast was well selected and the movie was fulfilling in many ways, except i couldn't see how they came to conclusions with the simplest of clues. Washington's character was one of intelligence while Jolie's was instinctively smart and brave. With a great supporting cast in showing how authorities get their job done, the movie gives great suspense and an impressive thrill. Angelina rocks and steals the spotlight with her charismatic performance. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy good acting and a good script."
2,Horrible adaptation of the book,"The book is an intelligent, suspenseful work of fiction. This movie is a lame by-the-numbers crazy serial killer flick. Anyone with more than two brain cells would have guessed the identity of the killer! Why did'nt the makers of the film follow the story in the book? Why did they change the ending? The one in the film is ridiculous! Even Denzel Washington's fine performance (That's why the film gets an extra star) could'nt save this turkey."
4,Public Embarracement,"Okay, so I saw this movie with my parents at the cinema ... yucky! But I was able to enjoy this movie anyway. The acting was great, scenes were sometimes scary and the plot was well done. Two thumbs up!"
4,Pretty Good,"As a thriller, this is a pretty good movie, but it suffers from what the books suffer from - namely Rhymes irritatingly correct deductions from the evidence when many many alternate possibilities must, and do, exist.That quibble aside, this movies looks pretty good - in a ""post-Seven dystopian gloom"" filled kind of a way. Jolie looks great - as always. I can watch this movie just to catch THAT dress at the end. Oh boy.Why did the movie producers change Jolie's character from Jewish to the daughter-of-an-Oirish cop? Sachs to Donaghy? Did they think an ex-model Jewish beat cop was what, too incredible? Surely in whatever movie she is in, Ms Jolie stretches credibility just because people as beautiful as her don't exist in real life doing menial jobs like the rest of us. So why change her character? If I remember rightly ( and I may not ) isn't Sachs' Jewishness very useful in at least one of Rhymes later cases?"
1,! LONG LIVE THE FORMULA !,"Uau, what a bad movie ! I could hardly believe my eyes and ears while I was watching this ""I wanna be a thriller"" movie... I'm thinking about buying the book, to see if the producers blew up a possibly good history or the plot was already so bad... Everything that is bad about this movies was already said below, but one question remains: Washington, how did you accept to play a role in this lame production, while being capable to star great pictures a ""Glory"" and ""Huricane"" ? I can't understand."
1,Disappointing,"This movie really bored me to death. There was no gore and it wasnt scary. I was greatly disappointed when i saw this in the theatre. The title ""Bone-Collector"" doesnt even suit this movie. There are hardly any bones and the one bone that they do find isnt even human. They have cool ways of killing people, but they dont even show the bodies. The villan put this one lady in front of a huge vent that shot out large amounts of steam. well, after being a little bit scared of what she was going to look like, they showed her. not a scratch on her body accept one where the villan cut her arm open. I do not recommend you waste money on buying this or even renting it. try to sucker a friend into buying it then watch it with him/her."
1,"LAME ( Both Denzel's character & movie ), wait for it on HBO","I saw an Academy Awards screenining tape, the movie is only so-so. Unless you are a huge Denzel fan, wait to watch it on HBO. I wouldn't even waste a Free Rental coupon on it. Wait to watch it on HBO, that is about its worth. The movie drags, its uninspired, its not suspenseful but you can watch it with some, and I mean SOME interest but not much. Save your money and or your time."
3,I knew who the killer was when I saw the trailer,"The bone collector is a really good detective flic. The only problem was that I knew who the killer was when I saw the trailer. ""some you loose, some you win, the game's over""I knew the actor's voice, I knew who the killer was. End of story. Other than that, it's a good movie."
3,"Like copycat, slience of the lambs etc.","I enjoyed it, but some things were just too unbelievable. How on earth can Mr Denzal fathom out where the killer is based on the minimun of details ? What happened to the heavy-handed cop at the end ? Did Denzal eventually get off with his assistant ? It seemed obvious the killer would eventually meet up with Denzal or his assistent. and so on, and so on. I would rent it than buy it."
2,Not the Best,I was very disappointed with The Bone Collector. It was neither suspenseful nor impressive. I was also mad that Queen Latifa died.
2,dissapointing,"this movie wasnt near as good as it looked on the previews. it was mildly entertaining and had good acting, but seriously good acting doenst always make a movie. you must have an interesting plot this one is semi-interesting.denzel couldnt even walk in this one which made it a bit boring. all the action scences had to be done by angalina jolie. i wouldnt buy this thing but it is barely rentable quality."
4,SOLID CRIME THILLER....... NO BONES ABOUT IT!,"It's hard to believe I never saw this film before now. This movie held my interest from beginning to end even if there are the usual plot holes. In the same vein as Se7en, 'The Bone Collector' is a gritty, crime thriller with some graphic crime scenes that might turn off some viewers."
4,SPLENDID,"THE BONE COLLECTOR WAS A SPLENDID MOVIE DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT PUT DENZEL TO A CHALLENGE OF REALLY REVEALING TO HIS FANS HIS ACTING SKILLS WITH VERY LITTLE TO NO MOVING AT ALL HIS WAY OF BEING THERE WHEN HE WASN'T WAS ... I CAN'T FIND A WORD TO DESCRIBE THAT THOUGHT , BRAVO ,DENZEL,BRAVO! KEEP UP YOUR FANTASTIC WORK ..AND WE WILL KEEP SUPPORTING YOU..."
2,two stars is generous,"A rookie cop teams up with a legendary (and paralyzed) detective to solve a Saw-meets-Se7en serial killer.This film is bad on almost every level. The worst part is the plot, which even if you turn your brain off still produces a bunch of ""huh? you're kidding..."" moments. No joke: documenting the plot holes, deux ex machina contrivance, and just plain inanity of it all would be a Unabomber-length manifesto. Moving past that, however, the performances are wooden enough to make a thousand toothpicks, and the cinematography tries to go for ""dark and creepy"" but just manages to make things to dim to see.I came close to giving this turkey one star, but couldn't quite bring myself to do it. There are worse things out there, but there is so much better, too."
2,...,"When i watched this movie, i thought in the end the killer would be somebody else's more bigger and scary, but i was wronng the killer just wanted to revenge, he was just a doctor and not that big, i can say short and thin guy. Regardles of what he did, supposed to be the killer is more spooky."
3,the bone collecter,"this movie had it's moments, they were few and far between, but it had it's moment. I personly think that Se7en is still the best thiller to date!!!!!!!"
2,What an American ending!,"It was a nice script that went sour (or very sweet for that matter!), with performers too big for this movie. Everything was packed in a 2-hour duration, people went back and forth, with no actual coherence, the plot was pretty thick but so, so shallow and the final scene was ...frustrating, to say the least (compared only to the waving flag in ""Private Ryan""). It's a great pitty, though, because the senario had every element to make a great movie, if seen from a more serious, ""somber"" point of view."
2,It isn't Se7en by far,"I got drawn into seeing this movie because it's a creation of the same director as Se7en. Se7en was a brilliant movie that, if you haven't seen it, you should really go see. This movie actually has one big flaw: it never gets exciting. It's not at all scary, the plot is predictable and I personally think Angelina Jolie isn't a very good actress. It's basically a movie like Se7en, with one exception; everything what Se7en does right this movie does wrong."
2,Not real pleased,"I had read the book like 3-4 years ago and I had been waiting for the movie ever since. I veiwed the movie this last year on the big screen finally. I was rather disapointed, with the actors they used and the back ground of the book, they had completely lost the grasp of keeping your attention. As the book, one almost had the feel he/she was right there with the killer, or his victims. they left out some of the best parts that would of made this movie better than Seven!. But, no, I could of made this into a killer movie if I could of had the actors and the money to do the film!."
1,My opinion: Waste of time!,"Shallow characters and a story with many holes. Judge for yourself, if you must...I want the time I wasted watching this BACK!"
2,Eh.,"One word comes to mind when I try to descibe this movie: Formulaic. While perfomances by Jolie and Washington were good, there wasn't enough here to keep me that interested. It wasn't horribly scary, nor was it very suspenseful. Mildly entertaining at best. I think most people should be able to pick out the killer halfway through. I've seen worse, but I've DEFINITELY seen better."
3,not that good,"The book was great,but the movie wasn't that good.If it was more graffic that would have been the ticket.Jolie's performance is bizzar.Occasional NY city accent."
4,worth seeing,"The bone collector is a great movie, full of action and suspense, but very predictable. Denzel of course was awesome in it."
2,Luis Guzman plays a nice guy!,"My only reason for wanting to see this film is because Luis Guzman is in it. And if you are a Luis Guzman fan like I am, you will really like the role he plays in this film. He plays a delightful, nice guy, ""Eddie"", with a New York accent. It was good to see Luis Guzman in a ""good"" role."
3,"Decent, but Unworthy of the Cast","""The Bone Collector"" is yet another movie that can't live up to the action, plotting, and mastery of the book from which it's adapted. The cast is great, and their talents almost make up for this sluggish, and at times boring, drama....but not quite. In general, the movie stays true to the book, but it lacks the latter's rich character development. Who are these people? For two hours you watch them scramble to find some nut, who turns out to be not as smart as he and everyone else thinks he is. Jolie and Washington are powerhouse actors, but their chemistry, in this film at least, doesn't wash. By the end, you're rooting for the killer."
3,Mediocre at best,"This movie was extremely disappointing. It had a really good plot and momentum but the ending made the previous hour or two a waste of time. When I found out who the murderer was, I was still wondering: who? why? how? And in this case, that wasn't a good thing. I adore Denzel Washington and was expecting something amazing. His acting, and even Angelina Jolie's, was good but even impeccable acting cannot save a dismal plot."
3,Good and gory,"Guaranteed nightmares if you watch this too closely. Fun at the time, altho the ending was a little slack. Good surprise, tho, but it just did not tie up that well. But up until the last ten minutes this mostly police procedural work was very entertaining, altho some of the gore could have been eliminated even those they seemed to filter it pretty well. Denzel was great, Angelie good. Definitely better than a lot of others."
2,Mish-mash of horror films doesn't equal scary movie.,"""The Bone Collector"" mimics the camerawork of ""Silence of the Lambs"", and the plots of ""Copycat"" and ""Seven"". This makes for an interesting movie with Denzel Washington as the bed-ridden detective who shows mobile detective Angelina Jolie the ropes in forensics. There are some flaws in the logic of the story, and it tries too hard to fit too many issues--the hardships of paralysis, the relationship between Washington and Jolie, Washington's estranged family, the gruesomeness of forensics--that the other aspects of the story suffer. Despite this, those who are looking for a scare, might enjoy this. Washington is fine as always, and Jolie is a promising newcomer. Two stars. Josh Bob says check this out at night."
3,The Movie Trailer gives away the killer's identity,"I totally agree with the person's review stating that it was a good movie, but he/she knew the killer from the voice on the trailer. Usually, the killer's voice is non-destinct, however they chose an actor that has a very distinct voice. It wouldn't have been a problem if they just didn't use that voice in the trailer because you don't hear the killer speak in the movie until the end (at least not when he is in his killer persona). I knew immediately who the actor was when I watched the trailer. I have seen him in ""Star Trek: Voyager"", ""The Pretender"", ""Alien: Resurrection"", ""The X-Files"" , ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc., etc., etc. According to IMDB, he has been in almost 40 shows and movies. I just can't get over how careless they were in using his very distinct voice in the trailer. Otherwise, I thought the movie was entertaining. It was also good to see Angelina Jolie do well in a role unlike what she usually plays."
2,To hear the producer talk about the book...,"In the BONUS section of the DVD, The producer tells that as soon as he read the book, it would be a fantastic movie, He is right.Then WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE BOOK SO MUCH TO MAKE A MOVIE?. What a waste of film, very dissapointing, the book was riveting,I couldnt wait for the movie to end, and i didnt care at all for the ending.I guess it is true, READ THE BOOK it is much better than the movie.Jeffry Deaver should be aghast at what they did to a great book. By the way, Jeff Daniels would have been great as Rhyme, Of course thats just my opinion, I could be wrong..."
2,Just follow the Dotted Line...,"This movie is so formulaic and predictable! I was expecting so much when I rented it, given the caliber of its leading actors. I was sorely disappointed when this movie turned out to be another one of those suspense movies that doesn't try to break any new ground, just keep you occupied for two hours. If you love the mystery-suspense genre, you'll like this, but don't go into it expecting anything new."
4,Denzel Washington = winning. Washington + Angelina Jolie = oddly compelling chemistry.,"If you're a fan of Jeffrey Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme series, The Bone Collector does a good job of preserving the spirit of the character and the plot. Unfortunately, Deaver must be dumbed down for the silver screen -- there's no way to manage to convey all of the detail and nuance of his books otherwise -- but it remains a relatively smart, high-quality mystery movie that can easily stand on its own."
1,The Bone Collector,"When I tried to play this DVD, error said incorrect disc. Tried it on two different players. Guess I am just out the price of the disc. Will not buy from this seller again."
4,Good Film,"As always, Denzel puts on a outstanding performance. Denzel is a very powerful and profound actor. He does a very good job of bringing his characters to life. Angelina perfomed very well; however, they could have casted someone else in that role. I feel like Angelina has a little too much energy for a role like that."
3,Semi Entertaining...,"This movie had it's moments and I believe that's what the producers relied on, those MOMENTS that were far a few between. If Denzel had not been confined to the bed, I believe he would have taken a more active role in possibly salvaging this movie from the poor ratings. Sometimes it does pay to adapt the book version, in this case they didn't and they should have."
4,Collecting Shivers,"Ok, it's not the best thriller. But, I enjoyed it. Denzel Washington probably was more challenged in this part of Lincoln Rhyme, paraplegic, using more facial features and tone to underscore his intensity. Angelina Jolie, as Rhyme's crime solving helper and eventual love involvement is quietly arresting. Queen Latiffah played surprisingly well.The story revolves around a vengeful serial killer. Is this personal to Rhymes? Could being involved again in forensics save his inner demonic life?--or end it? On different levels this film touches on some very graphic, raw emotions.A good film and you may enjoy reading the book by Jeffrey Deaver. Deaver also has these two as a team in ""The Empty Chair"" and ""The Coffin Dancer""--both excellent reads.Thanks for your interest & comment votes--CDS"
5,The Bone Collector,This I would recommend to any who love Angelina Jolie and DenselWashington. They are both excellent in this movie as well as thegentleman who played the evil character.
4,as always a great movie with a great actor,i loved this movie-it is a thinkers movie-not fluff or gore.
4,"Very Good, But Follows Some of the Other Good Crime Movies","The Bone Collector follows mostly the movie Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. Still incredibly emotional and suspenseful and Angelina Jolie, Denzel Washington, and Michael Rooker all turn in extremely terrific performances."
3,A great film for a rainy night at home,"You've read previous reviews with plot synopsis so I won't bore you further. The 16x9 film transfer and DTS audio track are really very good on this dvd. It's a very well crafted mood piece which will transport you back and forth from modern day NYC to a more primitive and creepy New York of the early 1900s. On occasion it takes on the feel of a Sherlock Holmes mystery. A classic it is not. A really good mystery movie it is. Very well acted, it deserves a good look and possibly a place in your collection. Did I say it has a really good DTS soundtrack?"
3,"The Bone Collector, Revised Review","The Bone Collecter is a good film, but I didn't like the ending. The explenation is of the killers motives is not on the same level as the rest of the film. The film starts out showing you the accident that puts Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) in his current situation. Now a quadaplegic, he has deadly seisures and a death wish. Rookie cop Angelia Jolie finds a murder victem with strange clues. With Rhyme being the best forensic anyalyst they have, the investgating officers bring the case to him. He finds where the next victem will be, but not in time to save the victem.Through the clues left by the killer, he finds that the killer is acting out a turn of the century crime novel ""The Bone Collecter."" All the murders are laid out in this novel.After the last written killing, Jolie finds that the next victem is Rhyme. As I said before the ending, murderer, reasons for the murders not as well done as the rest of the movie, but I reccomend you see it."
3,"Decent, but could of been improved.","Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) has been paralyzed after he had a huge accident in a tunnell. Rhyme was previously a brilliant and highly praised detective, and when he is told that a murderer is on the loose who happens to be killing people in strange yet clever ways, he demands that cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) become his eyes and ears to solve the mysterious clues.Angelina Jolie is extremely watchable as Donaghy, she gets her teeth into the role and she seems to be enjoying herself at the same time as pulling off an excellent performance that is full of effort. Denzel Washington and Queen Latifah are also quite impressive. Although The Bone Collector is sometimes a deeply flawed film, it is still very decent entertainment that even the most stingy critics will enjoy."
2,SubPar whodunit,"I must be missing something. It is supposed to be a who-dunnit but it turns out to be who-cares...the main story is a subplot. The real story is the developing relationship between the main two characters....and I'm sorry, but I never saw it happen."
1,Give me a break.,"Come on, people, if you are thinking of renting this, you DESERVE to sit through it. Denzel Washington couldn't act his way of a bad actors convention, and Angelina Jolie has got to be the most disturbing-looking woman on the face of the planet. Give this one a wide berth."
2,Not Worth Watching Unless You Feel You Deserve To Suffer,"Denzel Washington has that kind of screen appearance that makes me want to smell my own armpit. This movie was really, really, really, really boring. I was so bored that I took a jar of Cheez Whiz and poured it into my belly button and stuck one of those miniature Mexican flags that some restaurants put in their margaritas. Then I declared myself the Emperor of Mount Mexico until the Cheez Whiz started running down my stomach in sort of a lava flow way. This made some of the time pass quicker while watching this dreadful film, but mostly I just wanted to go to a turtle party."
1,This movie collected disbelief for me,"I couldn't believe how awful this movie was. The contrivances and machinations were just too much to bear. The way this movie was set up was absolutely impossible. It had all the standard cliches (a ""surprise"" ending with the ""least likely"" character, an obligatory police chief who bungles the case, no matter how it may be progressing, Eetc.) and when I did find out who the killer was, I didn't care and it had no pertinance to the rest of the film. There is no way anyone could have put this puzzle together and no way in Hell any serial killer would either expect anyone to or relate it to this string of events. There are gaping plot holes and incredible coincidences. This movie had me dropping my jaw in shock over how the talented cast was wasted and the preposterous setup. There are too many things for me to list on what was wrong with this execrable piece of garbage."
1,Oh my god!!! This movie sucked!,"I hated this movie, and it just wasn't because I read the book first. They changed nearly every aspect of the book. I can't believe that Jeffrey Deaver allowed them to butcher his great, gripping, sometimes scary novel the way they did. This movie wasn't scary in the least bit. I ended up fast forwarding to the end cause I wanted to see how they ended it... I hated it so much I ranted and raved for like the next week. Oh my god it was horrible. Movie NEEDS to be redone the way the book reads, with a very gay Thom, the romantic relationship evolving between Rhyme and SACHS, the UN Conference going on. And it damn better be sit on the edge of your seat what is going on...."
3,Want it in a nutshell?,"Some superb performances, but a slipshod, miscast film. And that's a shame, too. Do yourself a huge favor and read the book first. Then watch this with the fast-forward button handy."
3,Has a good message...but not really something I really enjoyed!!,"This book had a good message and I can kinda relate to how Alison felt. But then again it was so hard for me to get into this book. I found myself rushing through the book just so I can be done with reading it. This is one of those book where you read it one time and then when your dont you never want to pick it up again. I read it in one day and then took it back right after I read it...that is not a good thing for me. To make a long story short, if you like really sad books that make you cry and pretty much make you depressed, than this is the book for you."
5,Outstanding songwriting and musicianship!,"Mike Keneally never ceases to amaze. Besides being an outstanding instrumentalist and singer, he is a fantastic songwriter. His music constantly surprises you rhythmically and harmonically, and you'll never get bored.I love the Coltraneish guitar solo and polyrythmic extravaganza in ""Egg Zooming"", the wierd funk grooves in ""Looking for Nina"", and the raw rock power in ""Why am I your guy?"", but it's Keneally's outstanding songwriting that makes this album his best ever. Check out ""Chatfield Manor"", ""I'm afraid"" and ""Own"", and you'll know what I mean."
2,Shut up and play!,"I bought this album a few days ago and I must say I'm disappointed. My expectations were high, having read about his amazing guitar work in magazines and having seen him on the G3 video. Now, that impressed me! As I listened to the album, all I could think was ""When is he going to blow me away on the guitar?"" That never happened. He is a good piano player, though. The bottom line is; if you want a good guitar album, avoid this. If you want a Zappa-esque album with crazy lyrics, go for it."
1,Don't Buy It,"This is a crap book. Don't buy it. I have 3 books by this author, all published by CUP, and I swear I will never and ever buy his fourth book. This is the worst book I've every read. There are several common weak points of his books -- confusing symbols, lack of explanations on those necessary issues and lengthy B.S. on those simple issues. Numerous typing errors make the matter worse. This book spend a chapter talking about old fashion of moving averages, such as Spencer 7-point and 15-point. It almost goes into the field of graduation. What's the point? The chapters on ARIMA are also rubbish. My feeling is that the author lacks sense in statistics, all he saw are just mathematics. On the whole, this book is just on the wrong field, at the wrong time and with the wrong title."
4,Great at home bleaching product,"This product was great as I started noticing results right away. Six hours is a long time to wear it and I didn't know if it was okay to wear it longer than 6 hours as I like to get at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. The instructions state that it should be worn for a minimum of 2-6 hours... What is the max? No max? Okay.... When they put 2-6 I assume 6 hours may be the max, but they should have not put the word minimum to clear things up a bit. I didn't use the toothpaste so no review for that. Overall, I liked it!"
1,Disappointed,"There was another brand that I used over and over for two years and I was hoping these would work the same. They don't. They feel nice but who's really feelin them?! They are so heavy, they just weigh your breasts down. Not exactly what a women needs!! I wish I could find the fabric ones that I once had :("
5,"A must-read for the home repair "" do-it-yourselfer "".","My son & I are prob. the longest-running ""do-it-yourself"" (home repair) act around. Bought him several ""how-to"" books he wanted for Xmas -threw this one in for fun. Well, when it came I couldn't put it down. 'Tho it's not a ""how-to"" , it's a true ""How NOT To"" laugh-out-loud read for anyone who's ever done moderate home repair work alone. The title leads you to believe it's abt.home addition -but if you've ever even struggled up a ladder with boards (by yourself) this is a ""must-read"". AND in betw. laughs & read. what Not to do, you actually get really good ideas on what TO do."
4,Great Bitish Alt/Rock with deep vocals,"I bought this album because of one reason, the awesomely deep voice of the lead singer, and the few catchy tunes I had heard sounded smooth with great lyrics and vocals as well. As it turns out, this album has some great songs. I love most every song on this album, not because they're catchy and stay in my head, but because they are fantastic and include really honest lyrics. My favorites include 'More Troubles', 'Truth is stranger than fishin', 'Weasel', 'Treacle', and finally 'We should never have children'. I would most definitely encourage anyone to check this album out. I can't wait for their next."
4,"Over in leftfield, it's Absentee!","I'm primarily reviewing this on the strength of one track ""Getaway"" which is capturing all my attention right now.Off Memphis Industries (the label of the Go Team! and the Pipettes), Absentee seems to come more from the era of those delightful independent bands that emerged in the wake of Pavement. Just a little sloppy, remarkably tuneful; the comparisons to Tindersticks or the Pastels are apt but I would also include some of those great New Zealand bands like the Dentists or the 3D's, and underappreciated U.S. bands like The Mendoza Line (specifically the off kilter, sloppy pop music on _We're all In This Together_).This is absolutely 2 guitar, bass, and drums pop. But its pretty, delightful, shambling... and it's not uber-fashionable Gang of Four/Josef K retread, which seems to be all we get nowadays. That might be as good a reason as any to give a listen.-peter"
5,Great product and service!!!!!!!!,"This is a hard to find item, but I found it on Amazon. Great product and service! Thank you."
1,poorly made brackets and bolts,"Returned the baskets as holes in brackets were improperly aligned and could not get screws into them and baskets too big for a 26"" mountain bike. No instructions and gather poor quality control on part of manufacturer"
1,Item did not arrive!,"We ordered this product and it did not arrive even though it was marked as being shipped in the package. The product itself may be a fantastic product, but an absent product is a useless product to the consumer."
1,Withdrawal of last comments,I want to withdraw my last comments. They were directed at Amazon not this provider.
4,Very solid looking but doesn't fit my bike.,"This did not fit my mountain bike so I had to return it. The space between the baskets was too narrow. I don't recommend this if the space between your hub nuts is 5.5"" or greater."
5,Best Carrier,This bike carrier basket is well made. I had no problems installing it onto my bike. It took about 10 minutes to install no modifications needed all parts were included. If you are looking for a bike carrier basket that is sturdy and well made then this is the one.
4,Road warrior,"Strong, sturdy and surprisingly easy to install. Carries 4 gallons of drinking water or 4 paper grocery sacks with ease, plus 20 lbs of dog food on top. The only drawback is the obvious one, that it is advisable to split your load more a less equally between the paniers. Also, when combined with an eye-catching bike, the ensemble becomes the cause of much visible and audible envy. So, you had better get a good padlock as an accessory."
4,VERY large,"You could put just about anything in this basket. If you aren't put off by the width or the look, and need something to haul things around in, this is your basket. The instructions are lacking, and there would have been no way for me to install this myself, but I put my handy boyfriend up to the task and he did fine. He didn't look at the directions, he just fashioned up some kind of way to attach it and it worked out just great. The rating would have been 5 if the instructions had been clear."
4,Very well made,"I had one of these years ago. It was bullet proof reliable. You install it, and forget it forever. Thankfully the product hasn't changed. You can carry a small child in one of these. It is heavy!One con, the seat post bracket was missing. I couldn't get one through Amazon. I was told they would have to send me another basket and a RMA was issued for me to return the first one! Seems such a waste."
5,The Complex Simplified.,"Dr. Ronzio's book makes the confusing world of nutrition understandable. In true encyclopedia style he alphabetically addresses a comprehensive list of terms related to nutrition. With this method of organization he makes the material readily accessible. A gifted teacher, the explainations are in laymens terms and provide many ""Ah ha's"". It can be read cover to cover for a bonified nutrition and wellness education or it can be used on an ""as need"" basis as a reference, either way it belongs on everyones bookcase."
5,A must read,This is perhaps one of the most important books about the state of higher education in America today. Enjoy it!
2,Elitism At Its Best,"I was looking for an enlightened mind that could add new directions. I always believed you read to understand the world and most importantly yourself better. This didn't worked in this case, more withdrawn and isolated from those `people who watch NASCAR and support those I don't' ... but pay taxes and support his academic lifestyle. Sad. He should read more. Wish the title had been better served."
3,Difficult for average reader? Maybe that's the point.,"This is a wise, short, and difficult book. For example, he includes a fascinating discussion using religion as a jumping-off point for resolving post-modernism's overly relativistic thinking. Edmundson focuses on deep questions for readers - what does your reaction to a book say about you? Why do you like a character and how does he/she reflect you?I did find large portions of this book inaccessible--I haven't read Derrida, I am not particularly well versed in Shakespeare. I suppose I read mainly for pleasure and only partly for deep personal reflection. Edmundson would probably say--and rightly so--that this is because I am certainly a participatant/victim of the consumerism of the liberal arts education! And maybe that is one of his most important points. In any case, this was a stimulating read but it may make some readers feel intellectually inadequate."
5,The Image of Christ,"Beautiful inspirational book - with amazing illustrations by Master ArtistMorgan Weistling, nationally known for his art. I've gifted this bookseveral times to friends and they love it."
3,It doesn't quite capture his essence...,"Nowhere in this book does it mention a Web page. I mean, talk about reverse anachronisms. No computers. No Microsoft. No children shooting each other.And, dare I mention that phrase:I KISS YOUnever appears in this book.I was delighted, though, by the positive portrayal of the Turkish culture in this heartwarming tale."
2,Are they from China????,"A shop in my neighborhood has these treats and my Boston Terrier goes crazy for them. But after the Melamine-Chinese dog food scandal of 2007, I will not buy any food products (human or pet) from China. Its crazy that they don't put the origin on the listing. Seller?"
1,My dog wouldn't touch it,"I gave it away to a neighbor....his dog ate them; based upon his pup, it would get 2.5 stars but not mine"
5,A Suspenseful thriller !,"I absolutely loved it! I'm not into the thriller action movies but I was flipping through the channels today and I came to this movie on USA. I decided to watch it, little did I know that I was going to be so absorbed in it. I loved the way the story always had you thinking you knew who the murderer was but then the police found a new suspect. And speaking of police this movie was especially great because of Cadet Cutie Tony(Kevin Dillon)and Alicia Silverstone,who executed her catholic school-girl innocence well. Oh and the murderer turns out to be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you think I'm going to tell you,watch the movie and you'll find out!"
2,Almost a Fine Thriller,"An enjoyable movie that needed a good editor. If you can tolerate some slow parts, and ignore the sophomoric and silly dream sequences that clutter up the movie, it's very well acted by Silverstone and Dillon. Bottom line: it's a one hour movie wrapped in a 94 minute package, but the one hour inside is pretty darn good."
3,Truth is stranger than fiction,"High school girl who wants to be a detective like her father goes in over her head when she gets involved with one of the new deputies and ends up sticking her nose where she wishes she hadn't. Nice little thriller that flaunts it's name too many times in the beginning. Silverstone delivers as usual and the carnival scene, which is shorter than the video box describes, is the highpoint."
2,True Crime? Really?,"I couldn't believe this piece of dumbness. The Kevin Dillon character escaped from a max security prison and is now about to be given a police job? Really? Most of the dramatic entertainment consisted of him deflowering the Catholic School teenage Alicia Silverstone character. Dunno, my wife is a long time fan of real true crime novels and movies (i.e. ""The Stranger Beside Me"", etc.). Maybe this flick just needs a new name. ""Lame Crime"", or some such."
4,GREAT STUFF,"All Alicia fans will be delighted with this if they have not seen it yet. She is at her adorable best and with a suspenseful story to boot, and an OK Devin Dillon as her co star. I don't know why this excellent film was ignored by critics, although probably because it was made for TV"
2,Crime Caper,"The ending has always stuck with me. A young girl following her dad to the police force. Not a great movie, maybe not even very good. But a story good enough to tell.A collrctable movie."
2,Package is not complete,"Product is good for radio tuner, not to TV tuner. Product does not work with my Windows XP Media Center 2005. It doesn't come with a MPEG-2 decoder. Need to download the decoder from another vendor ? for this product to work. Wish I had known before purchase."
5,"Love the band, love the song","I first discovered this band in fifth grade, with the song ""Perfect Drug."" I was instantly in love with the band. I didn't hear this song for a little while (after I discovered the band) but the first time I hear it I loved it. If you like NIN you have to get this CD."
5,nine inch nails does it again,"Head Like a Hole CD-Single is a good CD to have to listen to the different remixes from songs from the album pretty hate machine like head like a whole, down in it, and terrible. The non-remix songs like you know who you are and the bonus track are also good NIN songs. It goes well with the album pretty hate machine."
3,"second single, halo 3...2.5 stars","im not gonna spend a lot of time talkin about this, but its just remixes of 'head like a hole' 'down in it' 'terrible lie' they all basically sound the same , and its boring and not really worth it...the originals arent on here, so you should just buy pretty hate machine, cuz its worth it, and this single isnt"
2,Trent is rich because of this crap,"This is closest thing to an official Pretty Hate Machine remix album that you're going to find, unfortunately it only takes into account three songs from the album. This is useless for the most part and is only worth getting if you're a compulsive NIN-collector. The upside to this release is that it encompases what you get on the Down In It single and the Head Like A Hole Opal import single, so you don't have to waste the money on those by getting this. The remixes on this are horrible as far as creativity goes as compared to later remix albums around the Downward Spiral and The Fragile era remixes. This only exists because Trent Reznor wants your money so he can continue using it to go Jet-Skiing and wasting his time playing video games instead of working on a new album."
4,Pretty Good,"This is the best remix album of the Pretty Hate Machine album. My only complaint with it is that there are 9 remixes of just 3 songs. I wish there had been more songs that had been remixed. However, I really like the 10th song, ""you know who you are"" (5th track). Even though it contains no real lyrics, it is one of the few songs that I put on ""one-track-repeat"" on my CD player. While based very loosely on the Head Like A Hole song, it is such a departure that I would consider it its own original song rather than a remix."
4,Black as your Soul,Great remixes of the only song that got any real recongnition from his first album. People in their 20's in the late 80's I'm sure will remember this song forever as the begining of Nine Inch Nails. The breakdown of some of the beats in this song are amazing. I can't begin to imagine the amount of time Trent spent on a really slow computer to put them together in such a great sequence. This is for true Nails fans who need Halo 3 for that collection.
4,Great Product -- Great Price,"My son loves the Cars movie. I purchased a bunch of shoes from Amazon.com for him to try on and these fit him the best. They light up and now he won't wear any other shoes. I tried to get him to wear something else, but instead all I could do was reorder these shoes at a larger size. I also orderded in a bigger size for next time. Oh and yes, the price is just right! I feel its quite a bargain."
3,Old Mase or New Mase?,"It really depends on what Mase is trying to classify this cd as? Being that he is a Pastor, this sounds more like a worldly cd than a christian cd. The cd is a nice clean cd and is better than all that other rap that has cussing in it and smoking weed, but he brags more about ICE than he does CHRIST. Lines like "" I got so much money that the bank owe me"" etc. He basically talks more about material things. Im not hating cuz I do like some of the songs but im just keeping it real. If you looking for a good rap album this is the one. But if you're looking for a christian rap album, I wouldn't suggest this one."
4,Better than Average,"I gave Mase a four star rating for giving hip-hop listeners a different messege, but this album should really only be a three. This Album should be considered alternative hip-hop in the realm of Talib Kweli and Common (Yes, I know, it's crazy for me to put Mase in the same category as those MCs but Mase's messege is that different.) Mase balances commercial hip-hop beats with a totally different messege that isn't too preachy. Now here's the best part...Diddy isnt in the album that much. That alone is deserving of an extra star rating. Now if you want great beats with a positive messege, then cop this album.I'm Out!"
3,Mase is Back?,"First of all, if people don't know, Mase is a rapper who became a preacher and now it seems he is back on the rap scene. I will admit that it isn't easy making a rap cd with no swearing, so for that he deserves some respect. That aside, his motives in my personal opinion are pretty simple. Money. Need proof? Simple, just listen to the cd. For someone who has been off the rap scene for so long, he could have had more than 11 tracks that sum upto 49 minutes. He is out to preach the gospel but says Oh my G... (you know what I'm saying). He talks about Ferarri's, money, him flying everywhere, clothes, spending cash and living in luxury. BUt wait? Isn't he a preacher. Not to get too religious, but the love of money and faith are polar opposites. He has talent, but rarely uses it. Not hatin' on him, but let's all be honest with ourselves"
3,Disagreement to JL,"OUT WITH THE OLD IN WITH THE NEW.... This is hip hop music evolving to a different kinda of style. It can't always be based on gangsta rap, yet i still respect tupac, bigger, etc etc but this is what we choose to like ""NOW"" so don't diss houston's album or any of the artists you have named because this is a new era of hip hop. What's wrong with CRUnk anyways JL? YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhh!!!!!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this album expecting Mase to have some profound things to say to the world, specifically the hip-hop audience, since his conversion to Christianity. Hip-hop is definitely in need of more positive messages.Instead, this album is nothing more than just another P-Diddy influenced commercial for the bling-bling generation. Mase sounds just as materialistic and $$$ obsessed as he did 5 years ago. Leaving out the curse words isn't enough. This album is wack!"
2,STICK TO PREACHING!!!,"Mase, don't quit your day job.The CD is not gonna cover for what you've miss out on.That was the weakest comeback I've ever heard from an artiston a five year hiatus.STICK TO PREACHING!"
2,Not feeling his latest style,"I don't know what happened? Sure, he went into the spirit thing, but man what happened? Not only has he changed spiritually, but vocally and in style. Ma$e used to be a regular rap artist, just one of the best around. Who could forget his wonderful part in the song, ""Mo Money Mo Problems""? And that was just a part of a song! Now, after 5 years, everything changed. His vocals sound extremly weak in every song. And what is with his style? On his ""Welcome Back"" vid, he wears what? What was that? A dollar store T-Shirt and cheap partially ripped jeans? Really, something happened to this guy, and I know it had absoultely nothing to do with him being spiritual. But the main question is if you should buy or not. If you own any Ma$e CD, just throw this in with your collection. If you don't, forget it. It's really not worth it."
4,Good Stuff,"After 5 years Mase has returned. His music is still as good as ever. Like Will Smith, he proves that you can make rap music without using profanity. Excellent job Mase. Can't wait for when you drop your next album."
1,This album is horrible!,"I can`t stand this cd. Mase reminds me of 50 Cent in several ways. They both had out a few good cds. They also were gangsta rappers. But,now,both of them sound like complete idiots. Mase, go back to the ministry. 50 Cent, start doing good rap like you did on ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin`"",not bubblegum rap like you`re doing on ""The Massacre"". Anyway,in a nutshell,don`t buy this cd. I would recommend ""The Documentary"",""Get Rich Or Die Tryin`"",and ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" over this mess. Also, don`t buy ""The Massacre"". Peace out, my n*ggaz!"
2,Glad to See Ma$e Back But Don't Sing,"The Ma$e album was solid with all the rap sections. It unfortunately took a turn for the worst when Ma$e decided to sing on tracks like ""Welcome Back"". His talent is in the rap world not singing. Breathe, Stretch was my favorite track. Honorable mention was the sample of ""We Don't Need To Take Our Clothes Off"" (#3)."
3,It's OK,"Not the best CD ever, but not bad.Clean lyrics, but some explicit topics.Overall, a worthy CD."
1,Disrespectful,"The cd was cool. I didn't see anything remarkable about it, but the beats were pretty good on the last few songs. Unfortunately, he wasn't really saying anything to make me rewind. Under normal circumstances, I would've given this cd like two and a half stars. But, I'm really salty that he was so extremely rude on the MTV Video Music Awards by walking in front of the camer when Black Eyed Peas were on the Red Carpet. If Puffy wants to be the annoying, childish, gawdy little boy that he is, that's his business. But did Mase have to be an (...) too? I don't even want the cd that I bought anymore and I'm selling it right now because I thought that was so unnecessary."

2,This albums was,"Very watered down but, okay since he's leading to the ministry. sample before you buy. if you want to play music in front of a lot of kids this is the album for you."
3,Mr too good for anything bad,"this cd is decent, there were some tracks that i really liked, my favorite bein ""Gotta Survive""...so if your into preachy rap, pick this up."
1,The Comeback is weak..go back to church,"This album is pretty lame. Firstly, he wasn't that great to begin with so i see no reason for him to even come back. I will however acknowledge the fact that he started the whole ""bling bling"" theme in rap on tracks such ""feel so good"", ""been around the world"", ""cant hold us down"". Back in 1997, it was different. In 2005, its damn annoying. I'm personally gritting my teeth waiting for that theme to phase out of hip hop- Cash Money Records thank fully is not polluting the market with their braggadacious crap. The whole dirty south, crunk crap is still prevalent unfortunately. So i see no need for Mase to come back. Sure, he cleaned up his lyrics but the lyrical content is still the same. In other words - avoid this album."
2,"I think Ma$e, ""Mi$$ed"" !","Without sticking a dagger in his art and twisting it, I'll say this. How can you disappear for all those years to preach, come back to the rap scene, and your lyrics/insight/artistic integrity remain the same?With this album I can see no personal growth besides the fact that he didn't curse, and the rare moments (I mean, extremely rare moments when he shines anything other than what he got) when you think this album is worth buying. I appreciate his contribution to the rap game (anyone say, FABOLOUS?), but the constant singing (not others but him) will start to get on your nerves about half way through the album.We'll see if the next album(if there is one) will give him a chance to redeem himself artistically since he's already been ""redeemed"" spiritually.MY SUGGESTION?: purchased it used, to support him, I can't see shelling out anthing over $10 dollars for this gross disappointement. **well above what I expected from his 5 year plus Sabbatical from the rap gam**"
5,Welcome bac Ma$e!!!,"Ma$e iz bac wit hiz thurd lp n came bac betta den eva. Ery track on da cd iz fire. If u aint got da cd go cop it cuz ery track iz fire. My fav, songz r Welcome Back, Breathe, Stretch, Shake, n Money Comes and Goes. I gave Ma$e 5 starz for 12 trackz n if he had more trackz I would give him a 10."
5,To Hot!!,He is back and back real good. The Cd is real good. Every track is good. There is not one track that can be bad. It blew me away. I personally think this is the album of the year.
4,for the family,"This Cd was a good comeback for the pastor Mase, he stayed respectful and rap about life,reality,money,cars,and relationships and of course God. I cant judge nobody so i wont but i can critque and say i didnt like the fact that it seem like he crompromise for the world but maybe he didnt maybe thats how he felt lead, but the cd was good start to finish its for kids,women and men who just dont want to hear about killing and pimping, Hope Mase got back in order and drop another one of these, but better and with more of God in it,"
3,"Mase ""Welcome Back""","Mase is back with his third album, ""Welcome Back."" Though not as great as his debut album, it is a breath of fresh air to hear M. Betha on the mic again. Standout tracks include ""Breathe, Stretch, Shake"" ""Money Comes, Money Goes"" and ""I Owe."""
1,Father forgive us...,"MA$E, apart from being a complete clown and exposed phony for trying to get back into the rap game, never could make great music and never could. His current album is even sub-par to what he was putting out when he was in the spotlight. 100 % trash, slapped together an album quick and cashed in on a gimmick. Jim Jones and Cam are right about this lame. If you want real current Harlem music listen to the Diplomats, otherwise let this shameful display alone."
4,"Not great, but good..Welcome back!","Give Mase a break..this album is perfectly acceptable. I actually like almost every track especially the infectious ""Money comes and goes""...It is refreshing to listen to a rapper without all the foul language and sexual innuendos. I,m glad he's back."
2,Something is missing.....,"I appreciate the clean, Christian message; but, Ma$e should had listened to some of the bangin' Christian rap music that is out there before he issued this CD.I'm really disappointed. Was this CD a rush job? If you are making a comeback, you have to come better than this."
3,"ok, but too pop-like","while the album isn't exactly bad, and it is definitely a good thing that mase is not just telling people to go out and kill, deal drugs, and beat your girlfriend, the beats have definitely gone down hill. this cd sounds more like a chingy or nelly album"
1,bad cd,"This cd was not worth my money.I wasted $11.00 on this crap!!. Where do I begin? This is a prime example of a good rapper who made a pathetic, no-effort, careless cd (the man made the cd in 12 days!). People who buy the cd because of ""Welcome Back"" will find it lacking in the quality and catchy hooks that Mase usually has. This cd had alright beats and cheesy raps(Ex. 1-Livin la vida wit out the loca. 2-I am one of the best rappers alive, thats why I wont retire). Another thing that grows constantly old is the use of his self praise like I'm so rich ,what I drive, how much money I have. Now don't get me wrong, every rapper does do it,but 8 to 10 times per song? Definitely unaacceptable. In short, the only reason he got a star was because he is Mase otherwise, like Juelz Santana said, ""Why we welcome you back? You weren't welcome in the first place!"". Step up your game!!!!!! Don't by This cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Off the chain,This album is so tight. I just bought about an hour ago and I love it already! Just because he's saved (no longer eternally separated from God because of the blood Jesus Christ shed on calvary) doesn't mean he's corny now. I just thank God for using him to spread the gospel through one of the many talents that HE gave him...rapping! God bless you all and know that JESUS IS LORD!!!
2,Not That Great,"This album was way to hyped up before it came out. Mase old stuff was way better. I wouldnt buy this album. It aint that great. The newer style is ehh.. Not good....#1.Welcome Back - 3/5#2.Breathe,Stretch,Shake - 3/5#3.Keep It On - 3/5#4.My Harlem Lullaby - 2/5#5.I Owe - 3/5#6.Wasting My Time - 3/5#7.Gotta Survive - 5/5#8.The Love You Need - 5/5#9.Money Comes And Goes - 4/5#10.I Wanna Go - 5/5#11.Into What You Say - 3/5Decent album but not some bangin shit"
4,Better than most comebacks,"Mase's comeback album was really shocking too me because he really didn't change his style much from his first days. The only complaint that I would have is that he has one tone in his raps. That being said, he uses that tone to fullest. The beats are great! Alot of reviewers say that there isn't really a stand out track, but they could listen to the whole album. That's a compliment!! I could listen to the whole cd too, but I would only bump about 3 or 4 tracks. Nice comeback Ma$e.Best tracksWelcome Back, Breath Stretch Shake, Money Comes and Goes, and Into what you say."
1,True Christians should Reject this,"No offence or judgement meant but i'm sure there are a few Christians out there who were not too pleased with all the flesh (Legz, yachts, nice cars (Lust of the eyes(?)) showing on mases new video 'Breathe, Stretch shake.' I aint the saint of saints and I stand to be corrected if i'm wrong but I think that the true Christians should reject this album."
1,What A Waste,"MA$E fans have been waiting 5 years for this? Instead of coming out of retirement, he should have stayed under whatever rock he was hiding under. I understand that Mase had a ""spiritual"" awakening, so his lyrics are toned down and more P.C....And his album suffers from it. Mase...you can't have it both ways buddy. You can't have street cred + be filled with the Holy Ghost and be a successful artist. P-Diddy is over...Mase is over...Biggie is dead. Rest In Peace."
1,unbelievable,"....who knew... that it could possibly happen... a p.diddy's partner in wack dancing, stupid rhymes, and forbidden love, would ever... ever be accepted as a legitimate musical artist worthy of the promotional dollars used to sell a mainstream cd. it's mindboggling... absolutely mindboggling. terrible everything. from the album cover... to the videos.. to the awful music, to his ""fall asleep after three words"" flow. please... don't ever.. ever appear in public again... don't make any more ""music."" and stop trying to spread your disengenious born again faith. mase, you're worthless. you were born again cause the real rappers in the game made u scared, and now that u ran outta money you're back... please... just stop."
1,Outdone Welcome,"MA$E, CRAWL BACK TO THE CHURCH YOU CAME FROM. YOU SUCK, YOU SLOW, UNRAPPING IDIOT. HAVE YOU NOT BEEN LISTENING TO THE RADIO? DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO RAP? I THINK YOU ARE THE WORST RAPPER SINCE CARMEN ELECTRA! SHE HAS MORE STREET CRED THEN YOU DO, YOU FOOL! GO BACK. YOU SUCK. I KNOW YOU LIKE THAT!"
5,Performance Replacement Air Filter,"Excellent product, my nissan gained a few hp. engine power is noticeable after the filter change. I recommend this change"
1,"Doesn't work, pure and simple","Agonizingly slow, wait, drive doesn't spin. A couple megs are copied in 15 minutes and then the drive stops.Worst drive I ever used."
4,"Great, soft friend for your little one",I purchased this tiger for my son before he was born because his big sister had the pink one and just loved it. It is super soft and small enough to cradle in little arms. The tail is also great for teething babies. It's very durable and cute. We're definitely fans of this little tiger.
5,Funk D'Void - Technoir,"Technoir is bright, shimmering tech-house from one of the masters, Lars Sandberg -- better known here as Funk D'Void. The synths are clean and sharp, and the beats are dancefloor-ready. But what elevates this album above other is the careful songcraft. Instead of simply looping the same melody, Sandberg varies the sounds, so that they never grow stale. Thus, ""Martian Love Dance"" has a melodic shift halfway through, while ""Herbie on Rhodes"" has a jazzy feel to it. ""Bad Coffee,"" on the other hand, is an aggressive thumper; ""Dope Lullaby"" goes more mellow; and ""Angelic Upstart,"" more shiny tech-house, is one of my favorite tracks on here. ""V-Ger"" delivers more wiggling vibes that you've come to love. The second disc, a live cd, is just icing on the cake. So go ahead and dig in!"
3,Not quite as promised,"Romane is my opinion the most soulful jazz manouche artist and the music is great of course. The cd does have the backing tracks as advertised, however, the info about these tracks such as chords...etc is no longer available because the computer system used for that is no longer supported, so I can not download them. A big disappointment as I purchased this cd mainly for the info and the backing tracks. If any body has that info, it would be much appreciated. Thank you very much."
2,Good looking but very stiff,"I love Kenneth Cole, I like the design of this shoe. The color Navy may not suit everyone's taste though. The worst thing about this shoe is that It's sooo stiff and hard that it can hurt after sometime. I really wish that the more I wear it the more it gets easy on my feet. Hope so cause I like it."
4,The first biography of St. Francis,"This book contains the two lives of Saint Francis as written by Thomas of Celano. The two lives were written within twenty years following the death of Saint Francis and so represent a first-hand account of the his life written by one of his early followers. The translation of the original latin was done by a Franciscan, Placid Hermann. This is necessary reading if you are seriously studying his life."
1,noisy....,i've just received my suit in the mail which i was very excited to get but when i put it on.... boy was i the joke.... this thing is super super noisy u can not make a move without making a sound and then to walk... sounds disgusting... it reminds me of a cheap baby's stroller rain cover.....ummm do not buy unless thats ure thing... and of course its extremely shiny i would glow in the dark its no way u cant see me shining! the shipping was fine... it's just..... disgusting i will not b wearing this.... my daughter said i look like a plastic bag....i agree
4,Did not use,"I'm giving it four stars because I'm sure this would work well if I can ever change it. Gave up after 20 mins of deciding how I was going to remove the old one. The filter is mounted on the firewall in my Eclipse. You will need long arms, good quality flare wrenches and a third hand once you remove everything that surrounds it. This includes the intake inlet. Standing on a stool, dove into the open space and did everything possible I could but couldn't get the darn lines off."
1,Not decals,"These were stickers, wouldn't be a funny joke to make someone scrape a sticker off their paint job. I had hoped these were plastic decal type"
5,from a Physician perspective,"Much has been said about the quality of this book, but I read it from a physician's perspective as a patient history. Certainly the physicians in Ivan's life let him down, not telling him the truth about his cancer and his imminent death. He missed such an opportunity to relate to his family. It is so masterfully written that I expect to be able to look up the chart. We as physicians need to help pave the way when we can not treat the disease, to resolve conflicts and improve relationships not hide behind a falsehood tha, ""oh, you'll get better"". A very thought provoking book from a patient-care perspective."
3,thought provoking story,"Having not read Tolstoy previously, I decided to try this. The story is one that should make you pause and ask; ""what will those around me think about me as I am moving from here to the hereafter?""Good, short provocative read."
3,Distracting typos!,"I will not comment on the content of this transcendent masterpiece but only on the printing. Yesterday I received at very low cost a paperback dated 18 Jan 2012, printed by Seven Treasures Publications. This is my first experience with a ""print on demand"" book. The cover and paper stock are of acceptable quality. The typeface is quite pleasant. However, there is a typo every 4 or 5 pages in the first half of the book, which is somewhat distracting. The translation by Louise & Aylmer Maude reads beautifully anyway -- vivid and moving. I'm writing this review via a link to the same edition. It has a portrait on the cover of a bearded man sitting in an armchair, leaning his chin on his left hand, which appears to be bandaged -- but only the title appears in the photo. No other identifying information on the edition."
2,It's missing something.,"I felt that this book lacked the kind of depth it needed to properly convey its meaning. Tolstoy rambles too much to make the story truely *interesting*, and Ivan Ilyich's untimely and meaningless end left me wondering ""well, then, what was the point of writing the story?"" The only factor that convinced me to give this book two stars instead of one was that at least the fellow gave it a really good try. Basically, it's too flat to cater to those who enjoy poetic or ""flowery"" writing, any messages Tolstoy manages to put across seem obvious and clichéd, and the characters have even less depth than the story. Furthermore, Tolstoy's apparent feeling about the nature of humanity is bleaker than Poe's. So if you want to read something meaningful with a mildly religious feel, go for George MacDonald or Peter S. Beagle and at least get a little enjoyment out of it. If you absolutely must read this book, though, take my advice and keep a bottle of Prozac handy. You'll need it."
1,Um....,"I chose to read this novella for a school project. I chose it because it seemed to have a good plot, etc. When I started reading it, I thought to myself that it was just ""a slow beginning"" which many wonderful books sometimes have. Unfortunately, most if not all of this books contents were dull and uninteresting. This is MY personal opinion of this book. Also, DON'T choose this book for a school project if you're trying to get a glimpse of the Russian culture, because there is really nothing here. Just a rich lawyer dying very slowly. That's basically it."
3,The title gives it away.,"Sure, Tolstoy has some good ideas in the book, and he expresses them well -- but the thing is SO BORING. Here is a synopsis of the book ""Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Ivan Ilyich dies."" I already KNEW that. The title gave the ending away! It has some unique ideas on death and religion, but I would only suggest it to people interested in DEATH and/or RELIGION. To someone wanting to read a decent book -- DO NOT PICK THIS ONE. If you've got to do a book report or something like that, I would DEFINETLY recommend this book. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ THE TITLE AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY ABOUT THE WHOLE BOOK!"
4,Darkly compelling,"Leo Tolstoy has managed to write a novella rich in language, imagery, and the theme of death. Read it once years ago in college and I was so moved by it that I read it again just recently. It's a haunting piece of fiction. And the final and haunting scene will stay with you forever."
5,One of the best books I've read!,"What an AMAZING book! It's short, but you will be sure to read it over and over again. The book is about the life and death (but mostly death) of the highly esteemed judge, Ivan Illych. Tolstoy walks the reader through Ivan Illych's last months; it's really amazing to think Tolstoy could write such profound thoughts on the subject.A must have- especially for lovers of philosophy or psychology!"
1,Dozens of typos distract from the pleasure,"The White Crow publishers of this classic should be embarrassed, but apparently neither quality control nor ethical consideration get in the way of a quick buck. I purchased this hardback to keep. I will instead throw it away since I wouldn't dare pass it along to anyone who enjoys reading. Having been fooled once, I will not purchase another publication from White Crow."
5,Excellent,"For the period that this was written, Tolstoy has a really good handle on the psychology of the dying and of those around them. This is a very introspective piece on the meaning of life and how one comes to grips with their own life (in retrospect) and death."
5,Who has not thought about death?,"Honestly, who has not contemplated their the subject of death. Religious or not, death is a part of life as much as living is. This book is a quick read, however, the ride is not only fast, but jarring. The last four pages are so moving, that Ivan's vivid psychological confrontation with death left me with a bad yet humbling taste."
5,Required reading was a pleasure,"I had to read this book for a class, but it was a delight to read. Tolstoy is the greatest story-teller, and his characterization of Ivan Ilych makes you want to change your life."
2,Jack Lord is NOT in this show!,"I found this item when I was searching for JACK LORD. Up popped ""Smilin' Jack"" -- a series I've never seen -- and Jack Lord is NOT, and never was, a part of this show. There is an actress whose last name is ""Lord"", but that's a pretty lame excuse for this to be ""classified"" as an item relating to Jack Lord.It's not. Buyer beware."
3,Killer Serial,"If, like me and a devoted base of hardcore fans, you love the old movie serials of the 1930's and 40's, you'll gladly overlook the mediocre sound and image quality displayed here for a chance to see the famous comic strip hero fly once again. Companies like Alpha Video (who released this and other classiscs like Radar Men on the Moon and the marvelous Phantom Creeps with Bela Lugosi) and VCI (Terry and the Pirates, Captain Midnight) have done fans like us a great service by preserving these otherwise lost treasures. Be warned though, that little care has been taken to improve decaying film quality; these are not the lush digital restorations we see in the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto movies-- blemishes, cue blips, acid rot, sync discrepancies and poor sound are the norm here. If the content interests, you, it's worth the dough, but keep your expectaions low."
3,Nuevamente en Vivo,"Un nuevo disco de Fish, con toda la fuerza del grupo en vivo, repitiendo, los mejores temas de su carrera, solo para coleccionista y/o fanaticos."
2,"Explicit lyrics cover, clean version, average artists, yea just give it a miss.","I just couldnt believe it, here was a good comp of tunes off the rawkus catalouge and every so often you would have words cut out, but my cover says ""EXPLICIT LYRICS""?robbed. Now im listening to tunes with that annoying cut.apart from that, I just have one other issue with this comp. It looks like a mos def resume of old stuff. Nothing by Eminem off this label (which was fat) or ra the rugged man, or even company flow!! Amazing artists that were just not represented for some other reason or the other.less mos def, clean versions and this might have been a better.shame on whoever thought this would be a big sale because rawkus had/has devoted fans.... just another major label failing at trying to come out with a legit catalouge."
5,Another perfect one by Jacquie,"I buy everything that comes out by this author and have yet to be disappointed. This book is full of sexual tension, good humor and great characters. Oh Chris where are you? Hot, sexy, sweet, all of my favorite qualities. And Melanie is sweet, insecure, smart and has great comebacks. I loved these two characters together. This book oozes sexual tension (and it's done at it's best). I loved the list that Melanie spouts off to keep Chris at a distance and then he proceeds to do everything on that list for her. Chris was a great hero - heres a man that wants to stay a bachelor but the minute he see and spends time with Melanie he seems to realize the inevitable. This book was perfect I could not rate it any better, if you have not yet had a chance to read - Run out and get it.The only complaint - not nearly long enough. I would have happily continued reading. Other books by this author that are great are - Never a lady, Love and the single heiress, Not quite a gentlman"
3,less would be more,"I like Bayless's Puccini album--a bit over the top but lovely nonetheless--so took the next step with this one. Quite a disappointment. I like all of the pieces of music he has chosen, but they are hardly recognizable under the excessive embellishment. He also adds other new age instrumentation and voices--odd. So I rate this a 3, or OK. I am getting rid of it, as I have other ""straight"" versions of the songs I would much rather hear. But if these songs are new to you, you might enjoy them more."
1,An uninspired look at amazing events,"If you'd really like something well-written on the subject, try The German Predicament: Memory and Power in the New Europe (Cornell UP, 1997). by Andrei S. Markovits [with Simon Reich; also available in German and Dutch translations].Markovitz leaves Zelikow & Rice in the dust."
1,Do not buy from here!!!!!,TV was broke right out of the box. I called tech depot to see if I could return the television but they denied ever shipping it to me. Called samsung and they sent a repairman to come and fix it but he said the tv's circuit board was cracked and that it's not covered under the warranty. So i'm stuck with a tv that doesn't work minus $800. Horrible experience with customer service they gave me the runaround and pretty much acted like they didn't know anything.
4,Quality Pop,"The first 6 songs would have made a truly perfect album. I have no idea what ""Your Legs Grow"" is about, but it's a beautiful sounding tune. So are ""Always Love"", ""Concrete Bed"" and ""Do It Again."" I agree with the Amazon reviewer: the best songs here the emotionally direct songs and it would serve Nada Surf well to expand on this style of song on future releases."
3,Average at best. What happened? (3 stars),"I know this isn't going to necessarily be a popular opinion, but I don't think this album has much going for it. Please, if you are considering purchasing this album get a pair of headphones and listen to the samples first. The first few tracks were strong, but it certainly tailed off. I suppose after the surprise classic 'Let Go' I may have been expecting too much. But that piece of work was head, shoulders, and belly button above 'the weight...' both lyrically and instrumentally. If you are looking for a 'blonde on blonde' type of track, you are not going to find it here. Am I dissapointed? Yes. Will I still give the next Nada Surf album a listen? Of course... but I wont be expecting too much if this album was any indication."
3,How to evolve,"The last Nada Surf record I listened to was their first with the funny song 'Popular', the rest of the album I dismissed for being too much like Weezer. Now they are a lot like more sophisticated (soundwise) bands like Death Cab. It's always good to see this kind of evolution in a bands sound. They are still not my favorite band and they will probably never be, but it's a good record to listen to nonetheless"
4,Not Too Indy But Still Super Dooper,"As a person who likes indy rock, it is hard for me to often let co-workers and friends sample different bands. Not because I want to horde all the ""cool music"" in hopes that while sitting at an art opening I can say something like, ""have you heard of said cool band?"" Truthfully, I want to share the music that I have found with everyone; however, when I do so, most people think that the music is too strange and off beat from what they normally listen to. Nada Surf's The Weight is a Gift is a collection of good pop/indy rock tunes that anyone can enjoy. There are no heavy guitar riffs, no raspy vocals, just a pure, steady rock sound with lots of creativity and heart. So next time you are at the water cooler talking about music, tell your cubicle buddy about Nada Surf, because everyone can relate to good music."
4,Tool bag,"Great bag for the money and prefectly fits in my truck tool box. I actually bought...5! I have one with sockets, clothes, rope/rachets straps. Hard to go too wrong. If the zipper was more heavy duty it would be a 5 star."
5,Tool bag,Excellent bag and value get you 2 or more i did in different Sizes one for SAE and Metric. Brand new and heavy duty
5,Green Army Bag,We have about ten of these bags. We use them to store our fall protection gear in. The green will fad pretty fast in the sun/UV rays. They are made from cotton. There is a flap that folds over the zipper to keep dirt and water out. They seem to be well constructed and have consistent quality.
5,sturdy,This bag looks like it will last forever. The zipper is heavy duty and the handles are sewn all around the bag so they will never pull out. The only problem is it's too big for what I wanted. This thing is huge! That's not really a problem of course. I will definitely find another use for this. It will hold a lot and not fall apart.
3,Smaller than I thought it would be,This is a good quality bag. It's not quite as big as the dimensions given. But it worked for what I bought it for and the price was right.
4,O.D. tanker bag.,"This is a very good bag. It is large enough to hold lots of gear. I use it for winch accessories and other things. It could be more sturdy, as somewhat more thick of a material but it appears that it will last a long time. I would order it again and may do so for other things."
5,Great Bag,Not much to say other than this is a great bag with durable construction. I use it to hold my sockets and ratchets. It is a much better way to go than a blow mold case.
2,Average,Decently made for the money. Somehow they are smaller than what you think. I looked at the measurements but they really do not hold a lot. Too small for my intended purpose but I can find another use for it
2,Small Stream Bass,"I'm just glad that I got this book at a deep discount. Although it does have some interesting information, the format is repetitive in nature. Instead of completely covering a topic, such as fishing in pools, the author returns over and over to the topic with little new to say. The text is disjointed and does not flow well. For example, the blending of fly fishing with conventional tackle fishing is cumbersome and distracting. Even though an entire chapter is devoted to fly fishing, it is already covered elsewhere.A far superior book on the subject is Stream Smallmouth Fishing by Tim Holschlag. Though Mr. Holschlag's book only has ""smallmouth"" in its title, he does adequately cover other species. It is a book that I will continue to review/reread every year, Small Stream Bass will not be."
1,Don't waste your money!,These don't stick at all! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. The adhesive wouldn't restick either. What a waste. :(
1,Not worth it,"As many others have said, it took our 10 month old no time at all to figure out how to pull the guards off the table. Wait till the child is older and isn't interested in pulling things apart like that!!"
4,Age Dependent,"This product is much more effective when used for children 3 and over. They have lost any interest in just pulling the pieces off out of curiosity. As long as the pieces are left on the table, this is a very useful product."
1,adhesives don't stick,"This fell off in about a day, it sticks so well to the furniture i can't get the adhesives off my entertainment center but it didn't stick to the guards at all. WHat a waste of money."
4,great product,I love these! I have them all over the house so my 3 yr old does not run into the corners of counters etc. I also use the long strait pieces that are from the same company on my fireplace edge etc. very useful but you need to use both the corners and the strait edge pieces.
3,Measure before you buy!,"I ordered these for our coffee table corners. The are rounded corners, but not so round they can't knock a little noggin. From the information I read about this product it said to order the jumbo/wider (rather than standard size) guards. Unfortunately I guess what I really need is something not just for wide corners but rounded as well. We have a lot of items to baby-proof, these seem very soft and durable, I am sure I will find corners that can use them. But they won't work for the coffee table and that is the area I am the most concerned with at the moment."
1,Choking Hazard,I bought the corner guards for my 8 month old and he quickly figured out how to rip them off and stuff them in his mouth. The backside tape is not strong enough to withstand a baby's tug. It was more of a harzard to have them than not having anything.
1,DO NOT BUY,this was such a waste of time and money..my 8 mo old ripped them off the first nightwe tried also puttin double sided tape and that just stuck to the table and made a mess...please dont waste your money like we did
1,NOT a good buy,"I got these to keep my 20 months safe, two minutes after I put them on my coffee table he ripped them off, the adhesive is not that good and now he is using them as a chewy toy, real waste of money"
1,Waste of Money!!,"Don't even bother purchasing this item. My son is 8 months old and figured out how to pull these off all 4 corners the day these were put on. Yes, it does leave residue on the coffee table too. But, hairspray or rubbing alcohol can remove that..."
4,Good for odd-size tables,I use these corners on my oversize coffee table and on my dining room table. The adhesives have worked fine for me.
2,Corners are not the only danger,"These guards only protect little ones from the corner, leaving the edges unprotected, and equally as dangerous. Tables, wether it be coffee tables, end tables, etc. need better coverage."
3,Who's Heavy?,"This book's editor's idea of ""Heavy Rock"" seems to be somewhat hazy.The book covers mostly Heavy Metal Bands,but expands to other genre music as well.It covers a lot of Punk/Indie bands & some sixties rock/psychedelic bands that don't fit under the Heavy Rock banner.That said,this volume is as informative as the rest of the series & worth buying,unless you are a H.Metal purist"
3,Adwa,I found it very informative and useful to my purpose. Also I found that it contains valuable historical references which are timely traced and recorded for people who wants to study and know about the Adwa battle between the gallant Ethiopians who fought using spear and defeated the well organized and militarily armed with modern arsenals nation of Europe - Italy in the 18's during the uprising of the European to annex and occupy Africa.
4,Great watch,"Why isn't Nike making these anymore? I love this watch, and I get a lot of compliments, questions from people who would like to have one as well."
1,sucked,"it felt very sticky and made my skin feel sticky all day, and gave me breakouts. horrible product."
3,Unhappy with container for moisturizer,I love the moisturizer but the container stopped pumping out the product before it was half gone. I now have half a container full of moisturizer and cannot get it out of the bottle. So beware of the pump action on the moisturizer container. It is too expensive of a product to waste half a bottle.
2,Tried to Like It,"This is the only Olay Definity product I've found that is fragrance-free and has UV protection, a necessity for my morning routine. It's intriguing to apply a foam moisturizer, but it's not quite moisturizing enough for my combination skin. Also, no matter how I apply it, the product flakes off, leaving my skin covered with little flakes. (I follow the product with a foundation powder, perhaps that's a bad combination). I'm back to Olay Total Effects."
4,nice moisturizer with sunscreen,"although a little pricey,it's a good moisturizer with sunscreen and i like it so far (using it for about 2 weeks). goes on kind of thick, with a strong sunscreen smell, but that fades, and the product seems to absorb well. alot does come out of the pump dispenser, but spread it onto your neck and the total amount is fine."
1,American Beauty Co,"The product came promptly and was a good price however two weeks or so later, I couldn't get any out of the spray bottle. Looked at the bottom for a expiration date and found it to be over two years old. Contacted Amazon and they in turn contacted the co. where they issued a full refund immediately."
5,Silky smooth skin,I love this product because it absorbs easily into your skin and leaves your skin radiant and oh so silky smooth all day long. The product provides a healthy looking (radiant) light glow to your face. Plus it contains SPF 15 to add some protection from sun rays. The product is a bit pricey but it does work great.
3,Interesting Read,"I already have a copy given to me by Rosean Loomis Gray in Clinton, New York. My Grandfather W.H. Wheeler's cousin.I enjoyed reading Dr. Fullers book. Wheeler, Born 1831 is my Great Grandfather X3. I had heard some of these stories as a kid....nice to see in print.Kat~"
3,need to more precise description to judge purchase,"Transaction/Shipping was no problem and smoothly done. but I found some scratches and fingerprints were on the both CD surface and label-side, and these should be noticed on item description."
1,99% USELESS,"William Carroll lists over 230 communities throughout San Diego County for you to reference, however the lack of detailed information regarding each community will leave you groaning inpain. If you're looking for a reference book with yes, no andn/a answers...this is the one for you. Don't be surprised by the numerous not/applicable or not/available references. If I couldgive this item 1/4 star....I surely would."
1,More to be desired about this product.,"The first few days worked great. I could not finish eating anything, I was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off. I work out daily, count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day. I did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it. I did not lose any weight what so ever. I think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but don't expect any weight lost."
2,Should have researched the side effects,"I purchased this product based solely on a commercial. I followed the directions - working up from one pill each morning and afternoon to three pills each. The first week I noticed an increase in my energy level, and a loss of about 2-3 pounds. But there were negative side effects. Diarrhea was the first: then I was finding myself hungry far more often; and eventually I noticed changes in my personality. The increased energy turned into hyperactivity bordering on manic episodes, to the point of annoying my friends. I have stopped taking the pills and will be returning the unused portion for a refund as soon as I locate my receipt."
4,Great for healthy hair,"I started taking it because I heard it helped hair. I have never had hair longer than reaching my collar, even though I've tried everything. I never for 1 minute believed NV would help with losing weight, but I can attest to the fact that my hair is longer and healthier than it's ever been. I have been taking it for 1.5 years now - and only 1 pill per day! My hair is now not quite to the middle of my back. Everytime I go to the salon she remarks about how much healthier my hair is. So, NV does have some sort of redeeming value. At least for me."
1,Doesn't help with curbing appetites,"I've taken other diet pills before, and this one is the worst at curbing your appetite. I still felt sleepy too. And the ""beauty-enhancing"" it claims to give... I didn't see a difference."
4,So...much...energy,"I'm a 22 year old female and I've had 2 cups of coffee in my entire life. My experience with caffeine has not gone beyond a bottle of Mountain Dew. I thought I'd try NV for the energy boost it claims to have. I didn't actually think it'd work... boy was I wrong! This is the first day I've tried it, and I cannot begin to tell you how much energy it gave me. I burnt 400 calories on the treadmill in 40 minutes. Obviously with only taking it one day I can't tell you about weight loss, but I should lose something if it gives me a jolt of energy large enough to help me burn 400 calories in 40 min. I am not a runner at all, and this is only my 2nd day of hopping on the treadmill. If you are looking for an energy boost, here it is. No jitters or crazy shaking ... expect to be wired!"
2,weight loss,I did lose 6 pound in the first two weeks. Just hard to remember to take every 6 hours. And you cannot have any other caffeine or you'll get a headache. Overall i like the product.
2,NV rapid weight loss pills,"For me, this pill does nothing to suppress my appetite. Actually, it seems that I was more hungry on it, and I don't know how that could be! For the first couple of days, my stomach was gurgling and it scared me but it went away. I have taken the pills for about a month, and no weight loss!! I will not get another bottle when I'm done. BTW, i am exercising too."
2,Didn't Notice a Thing,"To be honest, I didn't notice a thing. No weight loss, no change in my hair and nails...nothing. Sorry!"
1,NeVer again,"The very first day I started taking these pills, I threw up within an hour. It has not suppressed my appetite nor has it given me any energy. Today is my last day taking them, I'm not even finishing the bottle, as I am incredibly nauseous as I am writing this review right now."
5,The GREATEST weightloss pill ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love NV I use it every day, just one pill every six hours and 4 bottles of water. how easy is that. my mother and I love the stuff we just bought 5 bottles. I Lost about 10lbs in just a little over a month on this stuff. as long as they keep making it I'll keep buying it!! I would recommend NV to anyone wanting to lose weight. it controls hunger, and gives you a burst of energy to get through your day!! It helps your skin, hair, and nails!! ~Nv Be Desired~"
1,"""Not For Me""","I've taken many kinds of weight loss pills, and this is the only product that has ever given me somewhat negative side effects. I started taking it and within 5 days, I dumped the pills in the toilet. Of course, it did work as an appetite suppressant because it made me jittery to the point of nausea. It also made me have rapid heart beat, like to the point of thinking I was going to have to go to the hospital. Like everything though, it may work for some people, but it definitely didn't for me."
4,It really works,"I was sceptical, especially after reading a review of Canon's own, similar product. But it works. Images are sharp, and it does give me an effective 8x zoom. I don't see any distortion in the pictures (4 megapixel). The only complaint is the size: it covers the viewfinder, thus forcing me to use the LCD for shots."
3,Its two times closer than what you have now..,"I purchased this prior to a trip abroad for my Canon digital camera. It was especially useful in Nakuru National Park in Kenya, where the animals were very close, but the 2x brought them closer. It's big and bulky for the extra zoom you get, but it does what it advertises, doubles your zoom. Big cons are that if you need to back out for a wide shot, it leaves a ring in the picture, and you have to use the digital viewfinder screen, which is a disadvantage in bright sunlight. Still, it was worth the money for the dozen or so shots it really helped on, although I could have really used a 4x instead of a two."
3,Doubles your zoom.,"Doubles your zoom. Nothing more complex than that. It isn't a very dramatic increase, but I now effectively have an 8x optical zoom on my A540: not bad for a camera that costs under $200.And for the price of this lens, you can't really go wrong."
5,If you are married READ THIS BOOK,"If your marriage is dull or in trouble read this book with an open mind.It will work if you are willing to try it.I gave one to my neighbor who's marriage was heading for the big Dand they have never been happier her only complaint was, she wished I would have given it to her sooner."
1,"""Total Hilarity!!""","Now let's see if I've got this right...Morgan suggests greeting your husband at the door with your body wrapped in saran wrap. I suppose if your marrriage were in dire need of comic relief, this maneuver would hit the spot! But seriously girls...would you want your husband to greet YOU at the door in a Tarzan suit? (Just wondering)"
3,Hysterical!,"As a young married woman, I picked this book up from my in-laws ""lend and loan"" library from their retirement clubhouse. On our trip in Florida visiting them, and on the way book, this book has provided comedic fodder for my husband, sister-in-law, and myself. It is hysterically funny to read outloud and we are going to be sending it as a gag gift to several brides to be. While some of Ms. Morgan's advice should be heeded by any woman wishing to communicate with her husband, we have all agreed that while trying to make women seem inferior and submissive, we have taken the view that Ms. Morgan has simply helped women to realize that men are inferior, incapable of change and stupid. Take this book in jest if you are ready for a good laugh."
5,Dark Waters - an Insiders Account of the NR-1,The book is a gripping story of a submarine that few people knew. The accounts are just as I remembered living them.
5,An interesting book.,"The authors give us a very good picture of the demanding life a submariner lives. The experiences the fellows encounter are awesome. Fascinating reading, so much so that you don't want to miss a word."
3,runs small,"Ordered an extra small based on measurements and weight, but it was still too small. Had to order the next size up."
2,Bad book. Too long and too few pictures.,"Forget it folks... keep looking for another book.While this book is written for the novice/amateur photographer, there are MUCH better ones. In a nutshell, this book is filled with VERY logn chapters that never seem to end, not enough photos (there are about 8 pages in the center of the book that have some color pics - but that is it!!), and some explanations that are too confusing.Two books that Amazon carries that I recommend highly are: 1) 101 Essential Tips : Photography (a great little compendium of helpful facts and tips) and 2) KOdak: How to Take Good Pictures (a superb book!).Again, skip this one. (I bought it and shortly thereafter returned it to Amazon.)"
1,only for beginners,"i know this book from local magazine and it highly recommended it. but after i have this and read this, i was really disappointed. i started learning photography only for 1 yr, but i've read some information from the internet. the things in this book are not new to me at all. i really regret to buy this book since i can learn most of the things free from the computer...so i'll only recommended this book to the one who don't know how to use the internet."
1,if you has no computer,"i learn photography about 1 year only, so i want to learn something from books. i brought this book because the local magazine recommanded. after reading this book, i found most of the things in it are not new to me. almost all of them i've read in the internet already! so, why do i need this book if i've learnt most of it from a nearly free source: the internet?"
1,Less than expected,"Was disappointed they did not have more Lionel Richie, Luther Van Dross, Freddie Jackson, Marvin Gaye or Larry Graham... all who I consider the 'cream of the crop'"
1,More drivel from Knight,"Knight claims to be a Druidess, Witch, Wiccan, Dream expert ... Like McCoy and Conway, you name it, she'll claim it. Search out the *real* authors ~ the ones who actually have substantial background in their field. Read Grey Cat for Witchcraft. Emma Restall-Orr, Peter Berresford Ellis, or Philip Carr-Gomm for Druidry. Scott Cunningham or Kerr Cuhulain for Wicca. If you are genuinely serious about learning of the realm of The Fae, please read an author who has legitimate experience: R.J Stewart."
2,Comfortable but lousy quality,"They are comfortable and look great but they are poorly constructed. I wore them no more than eight times at the beach. After the first five occasions the transparent plastic parts at the sides of both sandals felt appart. I had to use Crazy Glue to attach them again. i wored them again at the beach and then the upper part of both fell off. I had to glued them again. I just walk with them, I did'n't practice any extreme sport with them. Is funny, they are made in Brazil and didn't resist a little sand and water. I have a pair of Rafters Tsunami that I bought three years ago and they resist the beach and every day wearing. Better go for Rafters, or other brand, or even sandals from Sears or JC Penney, they are more durable."
5,THE MOST COMFORTABLE SANDALS!!,"If you bought a pair, you are in luck!! These are the best on your feet and feel SO comfortable!! I have the black ones, which they don't make anymore, and I love them!!! Get a pair in your size if you can find them!!!!"
5,Victorinox AA Led Flashlight,"This flashlight is great. It puts out a bright white light that lights up a big room. It is a convenient size if you need to carry it with you. I bought to give as gifts because family members saw mine and thought it was great. It was a great price, too!"
2,Unable to locate replacement bulb/assembly,"I received this as a gift and I loved this flashlight for the first year and a half that I used it before the bulb burned out. There is no way to remove the bulb from the ""bulb assembly"" and no replacement assembly is available. At least with a Maglite you can replace the bulb. Disappointing."
2,Not what you would expect from Victorinox,"This flashlight looked in the picture like a Brinkman flashlight I have owned for years and I use in a bathroom cabinet for emergencies. I thought a Victorinox model would be well-made and dependable. Well, I am quite disappointed. As far as quality feel, the flashlight is very light and the aluminum feels cheep, almost plastic-y. There is no on-off button, so you have to turn the head to power it on. After a couple of uses, I already had to pretty much turn the head to the point it comes off to power the flashlight off. And when I tried again, this time I couldn't turn it on even with the head screwed all the way in, and had to try several times taking it off off then putting it back on. This is not at all what you would expect from a respected Swiss company that makes world-famous pocket knives."
2,Not what it is hyped-up to be.,"I ordered this flashlight as part of a Victorinox knife/flashlight set. The first flashlight that I received didn't work at all. I returned the set and received a replacement set. This time the flashlight worked, but only if the batteries were installed backwards from any other flashlight I ever owned. Well I kept that one, but as others have since reported this flashlight is no where near as bright as similar AA Maglites. I found it very disappointing and probably won't use it much, if at all. Well at the least the knife worked fine...as do most all Victorinox knives...they are still great!"
4,Simply amazing printer,"I have owned the Canon BJC portable printers in the past and they have worked flawlessly, but the package HP has put together with this printer can not be beat. The ease of installation, wireless capability, and the battery life have earned it 4 stars. It is bulky as compared to the competition, but it makes up for this in other areas."
4,Worth The Price,"Remember people, most of the price goes into the pure gold ink. It uses the gold ink to emphasize your written threat of using the ""friggin laser beam"" to those countries who do not accommodate your demands. It's nicely slimmed down for those last minute runs through the time portals. BTW, the text is sharp for a portable."
3,"for 50 million bucks, this should work with all my stuff!","i was really disappointed with this item. while i always have an extra $50mil hanging around, i was hoping this would be compatible with all my mobile tech devices. it would not communicate with my hypersonic fender capitulator, was spotty at best with my geothermic batter franker, and downright uncooperative with my radio color-bar generator!!come on, even my lanier LP138 can communicate with my radio color-bar generator!! this is garbage.the quality of the printer itself is great though, and worth the price.the ink is pure antimatter, and rich in color. it also smells like baby powder. the buttons made of baby seal eyes are a nice touch as well. a wonderful product, but completely incompatible with my hi-tech devices.i'm returning it. the 15% restocking fee is going to suck though."
1,"For $50,000,000.00 I would expect it to have WiFi Built in...","Ya know, all things considered, the price isn't bad for an all in one. I mean, if it's a yaht, a luxury car, an hotroad motorcycle..."
2,Gonna make a fortune,"I have been searching for a bargain printer for my office until I saw this one. Good deal. What can you complain for a $50M printer. But shipping kills the deal. Hey, seller, can you offer free shipping...?"
3,Almost bought one,"I was seriously considering getting this printer. I shopped around and really felt like this was the best deal going... until I saw the shipping costs?!?! Come on now, you really think I am going to waste $8.49 of my hard earned money??? I might be rich, but I'm not stupid!"
1,Waiting on the new model to come out next month,"The new model has a Halle Berry feature. Just click the button and it turns into Halle Berry and recreates ""that"" scene from Monster's Ball right in the comfort of your living room, and it's only $5,000,000 more.WHAT A BARGAIN. I'm holding out for that."
4,"Sturdy, light weight, easy to use","I haven't used the BT, so cant review that aspect of the printer. Overall, it's a dependable printer. The battery life is good. I carry a Dell E1505 and the HP DJ 460 in a back pack with no problem."
3,Great Printer But ......,"This is a great printer but I have so far been unable to get the wireless and the bluetooth component to work with Windows Vista Premium. I haven't had the time to pursue the problem but judging by the other challenges I am having with Windows Vista, I think that it is probably the operating system that is causing the problem."
4,HP DESKJET 460wtb,Funcaionality 5 stars. Design 4--the Canon is much smaller and will inroduce in April bluetooth and wifi connetivity. PORTABILITY 3 1/2 stars a bit bulky for airline on the go travel. VALUE--A BIT EXPENSIVE PRICES RANGE FROM $220 TO $312. I was a bit disappointed that at this price there was no wifi card only bluetooth. Ita a $69.00 option available only from HP or on teh net. OVERALL IT IS A a GREAT PRINTER--I PURCHASED two.
3,HP Deskjet 460 WBT Mobile Printer,This printer is a Great. Wish it was a little lighter and smaller but all and all its print quality is excellent.
4,Book Gives Great Insights Brand Management Careers,"I highly reccomend this book to anyone considering making a career change into marketing. It is well organized, and includes sample ""Day in the Life"" of what these careers entail, as well as giving you good clues in evaluating whether you might be interested. [...]"
1,Worst Decision Ever,"I purchased this because Ive been supplementing my dog's diet with coconut oil & thought this might be a good way to change it up. The stuff smells horrible. Like horrible horrible. But the worst part was when my poor dog woke up with hives and a super swollen face. She had a terrible allergic reaction to the Salmon Oil which required an emergency trip to the vet. The poor pooch looked like Mike Tyson. She got a couple of shots and is now sleeping it off, but wow--I would never have guessed something so innocuous could have lead to such a reaction. Goes to show you-stick with what works."
4,A good product for cats too,"Our vet recommended salmon oil for our cat, we could not find any specifically advertised for cats so we bought this and our vet approved it. Unlike several others, our 16 ounce bottle came with a pump as advertised (November 2011). Our cat thinks it is OK, she doesn't gobble it up like a dog might but she will eat her morning food with a coating of oil. She has been thriving the past year, her coat is shiny and I think the salmon oil helps for that. To us the oil is not unpleasantly smelly either. We will buy it again!"
4,Subtracting a star for misleading picture,"I read the review of this product so I knew it wasn't going to ship with a pump, which is the only reason I'm subtracting a star from my rating. It's a great price for fish oil. I had previously purchased a similar product from my vet for my cat's dry, flaky skin for $27. The pump actually got so clogged with the oil that it started leaking out the screw top and I ended up throwing it away because it really stunk. I bought a small glass jar with a dropper cap from my local health food store and put some of this in that to make it easy to dispense.A tip from my veterinarian: Just put it on your dog or cat's food instead of trying to force it down their throat. My cat doesn't notice it and still eats his food normally."
2,Not as pictured.,This was supposed to come with a pump top for easy measuring. It does not. Also my dogs have not touched their food so I assume they do not like it.
3,a very basic explanation,This book does give a very basic introduction to this program. For people who will actually USE the program should find a more detailed book. The Dummies Series in this case is a better option.
4,It will take time.,"The seat is good. It was used and there was supposed to be some small markings or damage to the cover. I've not found it. Unfortunately, I have a little terrier that has a great fear of the car. I was hoping this would help her. It has not. I continue working with her in the hopes she will get over her fears and enjoy the car seat and car rides.."
5,Best wat to travel with your pet,"We had one for about 7 years and they hold up great, and we would take our dog everywhere and even when we got our second Cavalier King Charles they both used the same one, of course we have the large one.We recently went cross country so we did not have to put the dogs in cargo and got are 2nd one. The dogs had plenty of room, slept or looked out the window the whole way. If you like to travel with your dog this is a great product that is safe and compfy for your dogs. Even comes with a strap to keep them even safer. They are amazing!"
3,Ehh...,"My biggest complaint is it's instability. No matter how I seat belt it in, it wobbles. I think that might be what turned off my dog. He tried to perch his feet on the edge by the window, and it tumbled forward. He knocked his head on the window only to have the car seat fall forward against the dash. Since then he won't stayed in the seat. Too bad, since it wasn't cheap. On the flip side my cat likes it as a bed."
3,"Nothing wrong with it, just not great for my dog.","I'm not really sure how I feel about this car seat. It looks nice and it serves its purpose. My dog doesn't seem thrilled by it if he's excited, but he does seem to enjoy sleeping in it once he's calmed down. This thing is HUGE - definitely something to keep in mind if you drive a car as opposed to a van or SUV. I am able to wedge it into the backseat of my Regal - but it is wider than a single seat in back, it fits much better in my husbands Taurus. Also because of the massive size of this thing I can't even open and close the drawer in it because it is butted up against the front seat essentially."
5,Love it,"I love the car seat,very plush and well made, with nice drawer. But I had to send it back, it was too large for my car, I am going to order a smaller one, Note:Amazon made it very easy to return."
3,"Yikes! Even the ""small"" is huge!","I know that a lot of people like this, but I sent it back because even the small size is just way too big. I felt claustrophobic in my car with that seat next to me! It is big & tall all the way to the outside edges of the car seat. I purchased the Kurgo Pet Booster seat instead and this was much better choice for me because my dog can still see out the window, I can still use the seat below, and my claustrophobia doesn't start creeping in on me!**Other Useful Comments --The color is definitely khaki. To me it looks gold in the photos on Amazon. It is not gold. Also - love that little drawer ... if you buy one of these ... definitely get the one with the drawer for pet supplies. It is just dead space anyway and even the small drawer is really good sized."
5,Comfy and Convenient!!,"I bought two of the Lookout II car seats for my French Bulldogs. We were going to be on a two day trip as I moved more than 1100 miles. I did not want my dogs to spend 18 hours in the car in their kennels and these car seats were exactly what I needed. They arrived in a timely manner according to the product specifications described. The tupperware drawer was perfect for storing their leashes and treats and other miscellaneous items. I have since left the car seats in my car and used them for carting my dogs around town to vet appointments, parks, etc. I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase and have considered buying them as gifts for my other family members with dogs."
5,Fantastic Seat For Pets,"This car seat is by far the ""BEST"" on the market. My three puppies love to ride in it. I wished that I had bought the large one,now. The medium seat is great for two small dogs,but a little snug for three small dogs. I highly recommend this comfortable seat for your lovable pets."
3,From A Distance,"This book is one of a small series, the second one is better, But I recomend that you read this one first. It explains alot about Patrick, aka: Alden."
1,Not recived this book,This is irresponsible of the saler . I have not recieved my Book till now. I recived email saying that the order was shipped but that was a lie. Thanks
1,"""Nine"" is 9 Below","I was curious as to why this movie left the theatres so quickly. Now only one thing puzzles me. How can a movie with so many talented actors be such tripe? This movie limps and stumbles, and then it gets bad. Two dance scenes would have been worth watching IF they hadn't been interrupted by flashback/dream scene/ODD interruptions. The lyrics, when they existed at all were trite and painful. Rent it before you consider buying. Better yet, ask to preview it at the rental place - the first 5 minutes are about as good as it gets."
1,Go watch Moulin Rouge instead.,"This is not a kind review and I am not a professional critic. I just felt this movie was so bad that I want to warn anyone who is skeptical of the movie musical genre not to waste their time or money. If you want to see something fresh and invigorating - go rent the nearly 10 year old Moulin Rouge.As for NINE, don't waste your time -- it's awful from start to finish. This movie has an insanely dull talk/sing/talk/sing pattern that never deviates and quickly creates a sense of dread and compulsive clock watching. The songs and story here are not overly compelling and you won't walk away humming any tunes.As for performances, the lady who played the wife did a stunning job despite her obviously limited vocal range. Daniel Day Louis gives a stunning performance -- too bad he has to play such a pathetic and uninteresting character. I also agree with critics who claim Fergi steals this show as she seems to have some real power in her pipes."
2,A messed up musical,This story line kept drifting from a dead mother to a mistress to a wife and movie writer that couldn't. It zigged and zagged so many times I felt dizzy. This certainly was no Chicago or Cabaret. Too many dips and not very entertaining. A total flop in my opinion.
2,Even the corsets can't save this one,"Nine is the type of movie that I'd expect to love. Great cast, great performances, great director, visually interesting, sexy, provocative. Yet, all that is not enough to make it particularly good. One of the problems is that as a musical, the music isn't particularly good. Marion Cotillard gives another great performance and Penelope Cruz spends the majority of her time on screen in a sexy corset and garters, which explains the Oscar nomination. Oscar likes his corsets. The garters alone are almost enough to get three stars from me. . . almost. Bottom line is that Nine is no Chicago"
5,I loved this movie.,"It is beautifully done.I am a huge fan of Daniel Day Lewis. In fact, I just watched 'There Will Be Blood' again, the other day. He is splendid in this movie. So different but equally well acted. A genre that is difficult to do well, and isn't exactly a crowd favourite anymore.My two favourite musical scenes belong to Fergie and Marion Cotillard. The scene with Ms. Cotillard and Mr Lewis.......very well done. You can feel the anguish in both characters so strongly.It is a beautiful movie I will watch again and again."
4,Bittersweet Divinity,"This film is very worthwhile. This has been criticized for lacking focus and being distant. Well the answer is simple, look closer and delve into the nature of the characters. Almost all flaws will disappear. Daniel Day Lewis always shines and stuns us once again with his dazzling versatility. The music is great and the supporting cast is equally impressive. Musicals adapted to the screen as usually hard to watch but Marshall adds his scintillating touch to make them special. I highly recommend this anyone who enjoyed Chicago (2002/I) and enjoys musicals in general. Your opinions of your favorite actors will be changed for the better."
2,But it does have lots of pretty women,"This adaptation of the stage musical based on Fellini's8 1/2makes me want to see the musical; not because the movie is good, but because it looks like the stage musical would be pretty good. The film offers some decent production numbers and some very pretty well dressed (and undressed, and barely dressed) women. May be worth seeing if you really like stage musicals just to catch a glimpse of what the live production might be like. Or if you just really like looking at pretty women well filmed."
1,boooooring,"Despite the having sexiest and most talented actress and spicy dance numbers this movie was a real snoozer. I tried to like this movie, I really did. Even sat through it to the end, but I could not symphasize with the card board characters....very disappointed. We can all relate to the lives of overpaid, under worked directors who have the luxury of chasing skirts all day,,,,I can really relate to his pain"
1,"meaningless, empty, god awful","What is this film trying to say? Whom is it trying to reach, and how? Did the filmmakers ever ask these questions? They sure didn't answer them. (How fitting that a film about a director struggling with a script shouln't have one.)Assuming this was a musical -- was it? -- I doubt there has ever been one with such non-catchy songs: banal music, grade-school lyrics. If ever a musical could use a huge shot of Steven Soundheim this is it. Leonard Bernstein wouldn't hurt either.Judi Dench gives a solid performance, as does Marion Cotillard. Otherwise, nothing. Couldn't believe when credits rolled that Anthony Minghella had anything to do with this. (This is a guy who used to write Morse scripts, for God's sake.)"
2,Uggh. Shouldn't have been a musical,The musical sections were just boring and awful. Everything else was interesting. This could have been an interesting movie if not for the elaborate musical bits. There just wasn't a singable hit tune in the bunch so they should have dropped them all.
4,100% Glits and Glammor,The costumes color light glitz and glammour really come through 100%in Blu-ray Great Fun!!
1,ATROCIOUS!!,"One of the bottom 3 movies that I have ever seen. Plot was horrible, Music was worse. I will never be able to take Daniel Day Lewis serious ever again. 2 hours of my life wasted, worst 5 bucks ever spent on a video rental."
1,This agony to get through,"Just to let you know I am not a fan of ""Nine"". Music is okay...""Unusual Way"", is the best song. I rented this movie and it has taken me three nights to watch it and I am still trying to get to the end. I keep falling asleep!If you think this is a great musical and that it is exciting we really do live in the age of complacence."
1,same poor direction as Chicago,"I know... I know... Chicago won all those awards! As in Chicago all female performances are done by actresses who really dont sing and dance that well. In Chicago every dance scene is cut after 10 seconds and editted together. In this film, Penelope Cruz is afraid of looking into the camera, and all the dance scenes are filmed from Row M in the back of the theater. I guess this is done because Cruz and others cant give a believable closeup, just as Zelweigger couldn't in Chicago. It takes a special kind of talent to be able to do the ""Vamp"" thing and look right into the camera lens. I don't know who's the bigger incompetent here, Marshal or Cruz, but to waste DD Lewis and have him sitting around grinning convincingly is a shame, and we are never treated to experience any real ""spirit"" or guts. It's all a showy spectacle that lacks the heat the play within the play is supposed to be so full of."
1,Unwatchable,"If you are familiar with Fellini, 8 1/2, or Nine, avoid this movie. Should you not heed this warning, see this movie on an empty stomach. Yes it is that bad. Colorful yes but empty. They redid the Broadway score and turned it into music for a cheap strip club. I don't know what Lewis was doing but it was not acting. He was just going around ""emoting"" all the time in a way that made him look silly. Horrid accent as well. I could not make it through this film. I heard it was bad but figured I would give it a chance...nope...it is that bad."
2,Pretty awful,"I ran to the theater to see this movie, largely because of the cast - especially Mr. Day-Lewis. I am not a big fan of musicals, but somewhere in my mind I was expecting a smart, sophisticated and entertaining movie like Chicago or Cabaret. I don't recall exactly how long it took, but sometime during the first half hour I realized I hated the movie and began considering the merits of leaving early. I give it two stars, one for each of the things I liked: looking at the cast and all the nifty sixties design. Otherwise, I would agree with pretty much everything in the negative reviews. Except I would add that the music is especially awful. Not a melody in sight and some of the most uninteresting and predictable lyrics I've ever heard. The play might have been better, but I can't imagine anyone breathing life into those dreary songs."
2,"Flat, lackluster film full of amazingly talented people.","What a waste of this marvelous cast. Each one of the ladies is mesmerizing onscreen, but just like in the plot for the film, they really have nothing to work with. Daniel Day Lewis is wonderful, but it's an insipid role, and his character is one of the most uninspirational characters in all of cinema. What a waste of time to watch this flat, lackluster film full of amazingly talented people."
2,Not your old-fashioned musical,"Perhaps I don't have the right background to appreciate this performance. But I saw enough to make me glad that I didn't spend big bucks to see this on stage. Great dancing, but very little memorable music.If you're heavily into Italian cinema, specifically Fellini's, you may find this worthwhile. I'm not...and I didn't."
3,Mostly gets the job done,"This is supposed to be an all-weather hose. My experience is that it still gets stiff, though doesn't crimp and crack in the cold weather like other hoses. Overall it's sturdy and I use it for filling my horse buckets year-round. Good hardware and the kink-protector at the spigot works well. I would give it a B. I was just hoping it would be more flexible in cold weather."
5,Powerful,This book is a must for ethics and theology. Tillich's view on love is very well laid out and this is a powerful work.
4,well written and understood by any age,"This book is excellent. The reader can relate to the subject from experience and theoretically. This book creates a visual for the words love, power and justice. There is a visual for the line of communication that can be created and crushed or created and never ending. I will keep this in my library for years."
1,Poorly made and cheap material,"I got this for my 3 year old and the size was fine but the dress was extremely uncomfortable. It is a very thin piece of rough fabric with a piece of felt underneath. The wig looks nothing like the wig in the picture, it is also very cheaply made and my daughter wouldn't even wear it. I couldn't believe it had a nick jr tag on it and it was so cheap. I would stay away from this product or you will definitely have buyer's remorse."
1,Worst digital remaster I ever heard,"The Liquid CD issue of this Benson classic material has a disclaimer that certain ""anomalies"" from analog recording are to be found. There's no excuse for what I am hearing. The screechy, distorted edge to piano, voice, cymbals, you name it is execrable, and I mean really bad. AVOID this CD. The original recording may have been decent, but you would never know it from this piece of audio trash."
5,replacement mirror glass,"great fit, good price.that is all i can say,why do i have to do so many,many,many,many words.this wil be my last response unles you stop telling me how many words to put in my reviews."
3,Just about too small to see,"On its own merits, this is an okay single of a very good song, but nothing to write home about. If you simply want to hear these songs, you should know that the 10-track ""Head Like a Hole"" maxi-single contains the two ""Down In It"" remixes (shred and singe) from this disc -- plus the interesting demo version, not included here -- and the ""skin"" mix is the version on Pretty Hate Machine. Unless you're amassing a complete halo collection, buy HLH instead.(For those of you out of the loop: Each official NIN release has a ""halo"" number, in order of publication. This is Halo 1, Pretty Hate Machine is Halo 2, HLH is Halo 3, and so on.)"
3,A Must for halo collectors otherwise.....,"I'm not saying that this single was at all bad. It's just that all three songs appear on other CDs. For Example Down in It (Skin) is really on 'Pretty Hate Machine' and as for the other two, Down in It (Shred) and Down in It (Singe), they appear on 'head like a hole' Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad single at all. It's just you can get the same songs from later CDs. A must for Halo collectors (like me) but to not waste money buy 'pretty Hate Machine' and 'Head like a Hole' and get all three songs...plus more. Alright see ya!"
3,A Good Dance Album,"Reznor's 1st ever composition ""Down in It"" gets mixed three times by Adrian Sherwood and Keith Leblanc. Skin is the version which appears on Pretty Hate Machine, which is a faraggo of industrial and rap, Shred is really just an extended version of Skin with a slightly longer intro and some cutting, dubbing and distortion for the last two minutes. Singe is almost completely without lyrics and is more along the lines of ""Fixed"" (a great remix album), being a nine minute gothic industrial-dance."
5,a must have,"true, these songs can be found on halo 3, head like a hole single, but if you are a serious nine inch nails collector, this is a must have.down in it, although not the best nine inch nails song out there, shows you the beginning on nin. this is the first song trent wrote as nine inch nails."
4,"Good, but pointless","It's a good single, but unless you're trying to get all the halos (like me) you should just get the Head Like a Hole single, wich has two of the three versions of the song."
2,unnessary,"i really like the song down in it, but all these remixes are pretty much all the same and not that good in the first place, AND are all on the american head like a hole single....since i do like the song down in it, i dont listen to this hardly at all, so the song doesnt get overplayed and annoying {i basically have this just for my NIN collection, because i am officially obsessed(in a nice way : D)} but if your not obsessed, such as me, dont get this thingie"
5,My rating is based on the music quality,"This is halo 1, my reason for giving it 5 stars. The remixes are great but sound so similar. This was the way for people to listen to Pretty Hate Machine. The Head Like A Hole single didn't need the Shred and Singe remixes, but the demo one could've been kept. So that's my reason. I averaged my song rating and it was 4.6/5. But right now isn't the time it's in quality."
2,"Why ""down on it?"" Because it's weak.","This single release heralds te coming of one of the best acts out of the last 20 years. A pity it foretold with such a weak voice.Nince Inch Nails is a great acts, and the first album, ""Pretty Hate Machine"" showed off quite a bit of talent. IT is my opinion, hwever, that ""Down In It"" was a passable track at best, perhaps the weakest on the album. With that in mind, the remixes do not impress me much at all.Being a collector, I do own the ""Down in it"" single--But that is pretty much the only reason I own it. If you simply must have it for collecting purposes, by all means, buy it. If you wish to hear what the remixes are like, I would recommend the ""Head Like A Hole"" Maxi-Single, as it has quality remixes of ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Terrible Lie,"" so you will not feel gipped for buying it."
1,Really awful.,"If this is the one that 'started it all', its a shame it didn't finish it.This is a really dreadful song, like an anti-drugs rap, or the anti-suicide rap from the popular move ""Heathers"".Bad songs can't be saved by remix-remix-remix- burning more money in the studio.It sounds puerile, cheesy, almost laughable when compared to anything else ever recorded in the 'industrial' canon.I mean, at the time this was released 'industrial' was at its peak. I advise you to buy 'Thaw' by Foetus, its only slightly more expensive than this, and you wont feel cheated.'Broken' is the only worthwhile purchase by this ,err, ""artist"".Its a shame to think the youth of today actually respect and listen tp this fluff.If you like Christian anti-drugs rap, which sounds somewhat more than marginally cheesier than ACID-HOUSE, buy this. Or donate all your money, possessions to charity."
2,"Great song, but blah remixes.","You know that song, ""Down in It"" by Nine Inch Nails, where he speaks to where it's almost in a rap, and there's lots of industrial noises on the chorus, etc? Well, that song _is_ included here in the form that also appears on the album. An entertaining song to say the least. I am just as big of a NIN fan as anyone else out there, but the TVT singles were really nothing to sneeze at. Especially ""Down in It""'s single.What makes this not worth owning? Well, others have explained that already. Besides, the remixes are boring, repetitive, and too long. If you are a halo collector, I guess you can get this. If you like the original ""Down in It"" and don't know if you want to get ""Pretty Hate Machine"" (a highly recommended album), I guess this too. But I feel that this single doesn't have the merit of the later ones like ""Closer to God"" and ""March of the Pigs"", truly great NIN singles."
4,the begining,"The 1st of a legacy of great work by Trent Reznor. It may only be a tiny little dot, but it will catch your eye. The twisting and mixing of this song fit the time and is still a good song today. This would only be for true Nails fans though. Only if you have a desire to own all the halos should you get this. Still worth the couple bucks though."
3,Halo # 1,"This single only has three tracks on it, two of which you can get on the head like a hole maxi single, so its kinda not worth it but it is the first halo. So why the 3 stars, well it's not that it's a bad c.d, infact it's far from it it's just that this single has so little to offer if your not a big nin fan."
3,Hmmm......,"This is halo one related. If you're a collector, it doesn't cost much, so you might as well get it. Not much on it, all of the songs are on Head Like a Hole single, but it is the only thing that is Halo One."
2,Its Flat.,"Down In It is a good song, but an album consisting of only 3 versions of that song and nothing else? Please."
1,Even the most avid NIN fan could miss this one out.,Don't waste your money. Offers DII in four versions of remix. All nothing to talk about.
1,wrong item,ok the details said vinyl. when it arrived it was a cd. i was very dissatisfied with the false advertising and waste of money (they did give me a refund though). but a headache nonetheless
1,pure waste,"I got this game with something else I was buying on Amazon just to qualify for the $25 purchase for free shipping. Complete garbage. Maybe good to use in the elementary school or developmental disabilities facility to teach to play poker (don't know why you would need to). It's you vs. 4 poorly drawn stereotypes of crummy players in a hold em tournament, that's it. No modes, no high scores, no career modes, no anything. Just because I spent $3 on it, I sat through it once - beat the entire tournament in under 1 hour without much hardship and threw out the disk with the game."

I love this book and would recommend it to anyone who like to work in the yard.
5,An impressive traditional production of La Rondine,"There are currently four DVD versions for La Rondine.For my taste, this new one from Decca is the best.Martha Domingo presents the opera in a beautiful and effective traditional production.I really enjoyed Ainhoa Arteta performance as Magda. Hers two Act I arias are sung with beautiful pianissimi and finesse which expresses vulnerability. She is very moving in the finales of Act II and III.Hopefully, the lavish Met production with Gheorghiu will appear on a commercial DVD (although it has a very weak performance by Samuel Ramey). In the meantime, this production will do more than enough."
4,Very enjoyable Rondine,"A very enjoyable production, especially Act 1 which I like to play over and over. Ainhoa Arteta as Magda sings one of the best ""Chi il bel sogno di Doretta"" I have ever heard - beautiful legato and pianissimo on the high notes. Her second aria ""Ore dolci e divine"" is equally beautiful. Opera is primarily about singing and the singing is good throughout. Good acting does add to the enjoyment of an opera seen live or on screen and the acting here is very good except for Marcus Haddock as Ruggero who seems to be forced into a role he is not comfortable with. As a minor point, because Magda has become my heroine by the end of Act 1, I would have preferred not to have the tragic ending in Act III."
2,Another DVD not as described,I buy this movie for a friend and the DVD wasn't as describe. The description tell that the DVD as French Audio (1.0) which wasn't true. The Audio is in Espanol (Spanish) with Subtitle in French. And the subtitle was horrible french writing (error every 2 words ...). Very desappointed of the DVD.
5,BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT,"I usually dont like Pedro Infante's movies, cuz they sing too much.. but i fell in love with this one. IT teaches u so much about family and the songs are very cute. Infante is such a legendy in Mexico. here in Peru it's not that famous but we know about his history. I bought this VHS movie, unfortunalty it dosnt come in DVD but still is a great movie, great version"
1,Crap,"This band is horrible! A pathetic attempt to ""re-create"" old school Biohazard, but it ain't working. These guys just plain suck! I heard one track on here... 30 seconds of **** can be used to describe what I heard. The singer is horrible. The music is boring wanna-be NYC hardcore. I wouldn't even buy this cd if I found it for $5.99 brand new and funny thing is, I did find it no wonder no one bought it. It just plain sucks."
3,POD ANYONE?,"Okay, I'm not saying I hate the album, but c'mon, they sound just like POD. Also the guitar work isn't very well but, the bass is excellent. He is the only good ""musician"" in the group, In my opinion. One good thing about the album is that the songs vary, none of them sound the same. I really woundn't consider them much hardcore, I would say it's more of a rapcore album. Im not really into the the rap/rock personally, If you like POD,Limpbizkit,old P.Roach check this out, you'll enjoy it. If your looking for something that has talent and rocks your ... off from begining to end, dont waste your money. ..."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"IF YOU BUY THIS CD, THEN YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE ATTENDING GLAAD'S NEXT CONVENTION. THIS BAND IS A STEAMING PILE OF HORSE SH*T."
4,ETC,"by Chris LisantiTo call E.Town Concrete a rap-rock band would be doing these guys a huge disservice. E.Town makes passionate, from the gut hardcore, and their lead singer just happens to rap with a smooth flow. ""The Renaissance"" is the Elizabeth , NJ groups 4th record and first for label Razor & Tie (yes the same people that release those Monster Ballad collections). Vocalist Anthony Martini shines not only with his lyrics, but his rap flow has come along way since the bands early days as a pure hardcore punk band. Musically the band is as diverse as they have ever been, mixing in latin rhythms, acoustic blasts, and light jazz touches along with the metal crunch of hardcore. Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed makes a guest appearance on the track ""Battle Lines."" ""The Renaissance"" is one of the best records of 2003 so far."
4,Good album,This is a good album... dont know why there are so many people saying its so bad...it just sounds different... sure its not time2shine or the second coming.. but it is still good...
3,Excellent reference,"Okay, this is not the stuff of bestsellers but I found the book to be well written and helpful. It's an interesting tour of algebra, calculus, trig, and statistics all told from a problem solving viewpoint. For example, instead of introducing you to Lagrange multipliers in an abstract sense the authors instead paint a problem that needs a solution. They introduce the Lagrangian as means to solve the problem and the approach makes much better sense.There is an assumption that the reader is familiar with college math and there's not a lot of teaching of basics here - it's more of an applied refresher course. Good book, though, that can come in very handy."
4,Ring Thing works okay,My grand-daughter wanted this bottle opener ring. She is a college student who works part-time as a bartender and thought it would come in handy. It did and she ordered another one for a friend.

2,NOT THE SAME as you are used to hearing,"This is a very slow version of the version which was made popular in the 80's. I should have previewed it first, thought I was getting the version I've come to know and love... make sure you listen before purchasing."

4,"Wolfe, again, to the rescue","I like to think of myself as an intelligent, discriminating person with independent views. But I have gone along with style and said things like ""Cubism is clearly in a progression from Impressionism and they from the great ones of the Rennaissance and beyond. You have to understand Rembrandt before you can understand Jasper Johns"".What a lot of nonsense.It still ought to be possible to like Jackson Pollack and hold your head up, but please dispense with the balloney.Art History is both difficult and subtle; but it's also right in front of your face. Why do we need Tom Wolfe to explain to us what we ought to know already? (And how does he reatain any of his friends?)I don't know, but it's been true ever since The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and it's true here.It won't take much of your time to read this book, but it will help to make you a better - or at least a more sensible - person."
2,Archie Bunker on Art.,"While this book is not without its moments of humor, it is obvious to art lovers that Wolfe has little idea what he is talking about. He lumps any kind of art he doesn't like into a single category of ""modern"" and thus bad--no matter that Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art are nearly absolute opposites; to him they are the same because they differ from what he considers the historic Western tradition of realism. Wolfe's contempt for any kind of innovation in the visual arts leaps off the page. He has no ability to appreciate what the artists he bashes are trying to express--the storms and fury of the Expressionists, the playfullness of the Pop Artists or the cold, elegant purity of the Minimalists. They deserve better critics than this."
4,the art world exposed...again!,"Art theory, literary modernism and every other pretense that dangeles in front of the contemporary art scene is laughed upon in sincere honesty by Wolfe. He stripps bare the forerunners of the abstract expressionist movement along with others, and disects each in a brilliant new light. Lirerary art is merely an excuse for lack of classical ability and wolf delivers this theory in a hilarious and compelling manner. This book is a must for any artist, and a bible for all critics."
2,An uneducated critic,"This is an unpersuasive essay about the failure of modern art and about how we are all caught up in the falsity and ugliness of modern art. In my opinion, I think Wolfe is writing without much knowledge of modern art. He sounds like an uneducated critic in this book."
5,Great entertaining intro to art theory,"This is a good book. Caveats: you have to like art theory, or at leas have a need to read it (e.g., class). You have to tolerate Wolfe's verbose style and his self admiration. He's good and knows it, but over-rates himself. Having said that. One would be hard pressed to find a better primer on the art world since the '50's, though it ends in the '80's. It's not an exhaustive review of all the schools of art theory, just the most prevalent, but between the lines it's all there. In this sense, this book is a good adjunct to another introduction to art theory that might be dry and hard to grasp. Wolfe's book will help contextualize the material. It's a good read that could be shorter (as could all of Wolfe's books), but then it would be just another book on theory."
2,disappointed,"There were some historical points made about modern art, but now much else to the book. I don't know a lot about art so I didn't find it all that interesting."
4,The Return of the Mucker,I bought the book as a gag gift for a grandmother who`s granddaughter couldn`t say grandmother so she called her Mucker. I don`t plan on reading it myself because it`s a gift. The shipping was fast and the book is in very good condition. The price was right
1,Extremely Lightweight with Terrible Graphics,Incredibly fast shipping and great packing. I just received this flag and was disappointed with it's quality. Extremely lightweight materials. Graphics are unacceptable as they are not crisp and sharp. If you absolutely must purchase this flag it would appropriate for hanging on a wall indoors ONLY. Any wrinkles or folds are mitigated with a quick ironing.
2,Russian Royal Flag,Cant't fly it outside otherwise immediately fray and require a purchase of yet another flag. My fault - it should be nylon
5,Imperial Russia Comes Alive,"Step back into history with this great flag, so well detailed, just like those that flew above the residences of the Czar! A great item to be framed and hung in your home as well. The polyester materials ensure a long lasting like new appearance. As an Imperial Russian history buff, I was delighted to receive this. Who knew these were still being made? I am believing you can find just about anything on Amazon Marketplace! Great value for the money!"
2,Doesn't fit right,"The phone holster doesn't fit the phone right, so I have to be careful my phone doesn't fall out."
3,"very interesting in parts, yet also gets tiresome","Rating this album puts me in a quandry. It shows great skill overall, and is extremely interesting in some parts of some songs. But it just gets tiresome on several songs, and so on the whole, it is just ""OK"". It was smart to use local musicians. There is something very unique and unusual about this album, otherwise I would have rated it 2 stars, not 3."
4,"Rhythmic & mysterious, a good listen for Anne Dudley fans","Surprising when I first listened to it, and more likable with each play, ""Songs..."" shows more of the orchestral strengths of Anne Dudley and less of the Art of Noise influences (though some old familiar samples still appear.) A good listen, and worth buying."
4,A Great Soundtrack to a Great Slideshow,"Imagine if, the next time you went to another country on vacation, you brought back an album you had recorded rather than a video or slideshow. That's sort of what Anne Dudley and Jaz Coleman have done here. They ""keep it real"" by using Egpytian players and instruments throughout, but rather than record a straight-up Egyptian folk album, they add their own instruments and musical ideas to make it a very interesting mixture of the two cultures. Although it works best as background music, certain tracks stand out - ""Ziggarats of Cinnamon"", ""The Conqueror"" and my favorite, ""Endless Festival"". Listen to the samples, and if it floats your boat, pick it up."
5,Quick healing solution,This is a quick remedy for pain relief. Burns a little bit once you put it on but it does relieve the pain of soar muscles and joint issues.
1,Weird Toxic Gel Stink- not the best form of DMSO,"I bought a tub of this gel stuff and it smells entirely different than some other 99.9 % pure stuff I bought in liquid form. I was horrified at the toxic stink. I am actually afraid to use this stuff. The smell makes me nauseous. How can this be good when DMSO makes whatever you put it with soak into your body quicker. I mean, you can literally drink good DMSO. This stuff makes me want to puke. I am not knocking DMSO in general at all, just this nauseous gel form. Stick with the purest liquid you can find. Shop around. Skip the gel."
1,WORK,"Doesn't work on this horse, was a waist of money and my time. Don't know how you stay in business selling this kind of product. (never again)"
5,DMSO-The Wonder Treatment Kept Hidden,"DMSO has many uses. Primarily it is a solvent useful to clean greasy items.However, I use it for pain relief (i.e., burns, bee stings, sunburn, etc.). It is also good for toenail fungus, but slower."
3,Not what I had hoped,DMSO is an effective pain reliever but it did not work on my wrist. I did get perhaps 30-40% relief but it was at the cost of a burning sensation on my skin. I'm using it until I find something better but it's not the total pain relief I had hoped for.
1,OUCH,"I recently ordered some of this DMSO after reading a bunch about its muscle-pain relieving qualities and so forth, and as soon as I received it a few days ago, I applied it to my shoulder to relieve the pain from a recent injury. After about 15 minutes, I felt the pain starting to subside and I figured the stuff was great! However, a few minutes later, I noticed the tingling that I felt after I had applied it had gotten worse and worse until it felt like a full-on sunburn!! My skin had turned BRIGHT red everywhere it had been applied, and it felt like i had a sever sunburn in that area.Just a word of warning-- It says use as a SOLVENT ONLY for a reason!! Do not buy this for applying to your skin!!"
5,Once Read your heart will sore.,"This story/Play is outstanding. Your heart breaks. I saw the production in New York years ago. When I returned home I introducted it to our students, there response was over whelming in producing the production. We introduced it to our home town and the audience members said, ""My God what a play'"", The writer knows how to tug at your heart strings.""I believe if you love reading stories that moves the heart and mind, do pick up a copy and I know you will think the same way that our town has.

3,red cap?,the fuel cap works ok the only dissapointment is that the image shows red cap and i received a black fuel cap.
5,Death the final stage of growth,"This is a classic book that should be read by doctors, nurses and people that cares terminal or long-term ill people. But it is also important for everybody to stop thinking about death as something scary or terrible or even not thinking about death as part of life.On the other hand, Kubler-Ross is well knowned and this is not the first book I read from her."
2,Seiko men's automatic stainless steel watch,"The watch is a beautiful one, but when my husband doesn't wear it for a day or two the time is always off and he gets upset. If I would have known that it was going to be like this I would not have ordered it. But it is a nice watch. I guess he will have to sleep with it."
2,Not as nice as in picture,"Unfortunately, this watch was not nearly as nice in person as it was in the picture... it was quite dissapointing."
4,Decent quality product for the price,The product is just as described. It is a good product for a good price. Nothing out of the ordinary.
5,My Grandson Loved IT!,My grandson was so excited when he opened this Christmas present. He loved it so much he put it on the car immediately!
5,Cheerleaders male and female at their best,"This DVD was worth the money with lots of color and good sound. It shows young people doing what they like most, the film is very good quality and I recommend to others."
3,Great concept…but,I tried to sharpen a few skew gouges with poor results. The final grind had a slight swept curve to the edge and was not as sharp as honing by hand. But then again I’m picky when it comes to the quality of the edge on my skews. However the skew attachment would be useful for anyone that is starting out or is not comfortable of honing by hand.
1,Overpriced/Overrated,"Save your money and buy a three ringed binder, for that is all this is. It only has 8 actual pages to write recipes and 2 small recipe cards and ,of course and orderform to buy more. Because you will need it with this sparse organizer. The helpful info. section is better off in the trash. This section is useless. Well, if you only have 10 recipes to your collection it is prob. perfect."
1,too late,"I ordered A Table of Grace as a shower gift for my daughter-in-law to be. I requested 2nd day air as her shower was 2 weeks away and I wanted to be sure to have it in time. The book, although very nice, arrived after the shower. Too late!"
4,Old School but Good,"This cd is not quite as good as their music from the nineties. However, true KLF fans will still want it for classic eighties hip-hop, rap, soul, r&b, and dance music in general. It sounds good but younger fans may not like it. I am 39 years old so it does not really bother me. One or two songs really pump me up. This cd is good for KLF's older fans or younger fans that enjoy older rap/hip-hop style music."
3,History AKA time lords,hard to get. Good old house music. great service form amazon.com. we'll use you again thankyou.all occasions mobile disco
2,KLF? I don't hear no KLF in here....,"In a (big) word: DISAPPOINTED.I have WHITE ROOM & CHILL OUT, and love 'm. Went looking for more of the same & found this disk here on Amazon. Aside from a couple of entertaining tracks/ideas, there's nothing here to satisfy my urge for more KLF.Which leads me to another big word: FRUSTRATED."
1,piece of crap,I own two sony blue ray players both work flawlessly. This piece of crap is constantly freezing and requiring a restart....which of course takes about three times as long as sony to do. I hate this machine. BUY THE SONY!!!!! I wish I could give this 0 stars. Oh also no Amazon Unbox APP for movies like the Sony has.
2,great- when it works,"The picture quality is great but sometimes when we try to use it, we have to unplug every cord and wait a few minutes, sometimes we have to do this several times before it will recognize the DVD or Bluray. Sometimes it works just fine but when it doesn't, it is very frustrating. I have read several other reviews that say the same thing so I know it's not just our machine."
1,Stopped working after 5 month,"This is poor piece of equipment. I used it a few dozen times over about four months. In month five when I tried to watch it, it wouldn't even come on."
1,"Samsung Garbage - failed a month after warranty, like their TV","Had this player - overall it was OK, not great, but not bad for the price. Within a month after the warranty expired it stopped playing Blu-ray disks. Has the latest firmware, etc. I called Samsung and after trying a couple of ""fixes"" was advised to send it in for repair at a cost of $110. I don't think so! Shopping for a different brand now. A Samsung TV I bought failed a couple of weeks before warranty expired. They had to replace the whole thing, a piece at a time. I love my Sharp TVs, and various Sony components - no reliability issues with any of those. Samsung can't make it much over a year - two for two now."
4,Cautions and Hints,"1) Making the Avatar Blu-Ray disk play: As received this Blu-Ray player would not play the Avatar Blu-Ray disk. After I installed the new software/firmware using the built in update system over the attached network the Avatar disk still would not play. Only after I had unplugged the player, waited 30 seconds, and replugged the play into the power did the Avatar Blu-Ray disk play properly.2) This is my first Blu-Ray player so no comparison is possible. One annoying feature is that while starting a Blu-Ray disk the player will connect and disconnect the connection to the TV several times, blanking the screen, causing the TV to say nit has no input source, causing the sound to pop and crackle on the TV. This also happens when accessing the internet features.3) The Blu-Ray playback is beautiful and worth all the little annoyances."
1,Junk,"Took unit out of box. Wouln't eject disc tray. Complete garbage, which is where it is now. You get what you pay for."
1,Have never seen such a junk,"I bought it to access Internet TV (Netflix, Youtube, etc.) After 3 hours of struggling was not able to activate Internet TV.Network connection - perfect.Accept license agreement - YES (many times).Internet@TV: enter: Samsung ADsSamsung Apps: .... Loading .... Network Interference Occurred .... try again later ( many cycles ).At some point - Everything in Spanish, still not going anywhere.Have never seen such a buggy software (firmware). Nothing works.Returning to Fry's tomorrow. ... May consider never buy Samsung again."
1,Worst BluRay Player of all time,"I have honestly never encountered a machine of such poor quality. DVDs freeze and even Netflix will take over 3 minutes to load anything. Do not buy this machine, it is a complete waste of money. Samsung should be completeley ashamed of releasing such a poor product."
2,Samsung Blu-ray info,Good product at a good price. Didn't realize it did not have a memory card in side. Found the USB on the front and installed a memory card and it works great. Good product!
4,Bang for the bucks,"I bought this blue-ray player 3 weeks back. It has worked very well. Initially, I was using the standard AVI cables and the video quality of netflix/yourtube were not that great. The quality improved after I switched to hdmi cables. I am using the ethernet cables for internet connectivity and it has worked pretty well so far. It was not able to play some DVDs I bought in India (I guess some region settings), the same DVDs play fine on my regular DVD player. But it's not a big deal for me. All in all, it was a good investment."
1,White Flashes,Can anyone tell me why this player when connected to a LG LCD TV screen via HDM Profigold cable makes white flashes ?What can I do for it to stop doing it?Thanks
1,Stopped playing blu-ray DVDs,"Bought this for my daughter Christmas 2010. Good Netflix interface. However, just found out from her the the unit will not play blu-ray DVDs any more (only 17 months of minimal DVD use) - both Inception and Thor blu-ray DVDs give read error message, though non-blu-ray plays OK. (Both discs play OK on a Panasonic model I bought from Amazon Christmas 2011 for $89). I'll update this review when I find out repair estimate from Samsung."
2,No Closed Caption with Netflix & non-standard Wi-fi Adapter,"Well, this has been a huge disappointment. I bought this product not realizing it needed a Samsung only wifi adapter. It was very expensive... I would have liked to know that BEFORE the purchase. Also, Netflix doesn't have closed caption. I love to use CC because we can lower the volume, but NOOOOO. Frankly, I took that for granted. I was wrong. If I had to it do over, I would have gotten a Sony."
3,Loved it even though it was defective,"I saw the reviews here and thought it sounded really good. It is, except on mine the video kept dropping out every few minutes. Fortunately Amazon is refunding the price and I am returning it. Thanks for that. It really has nice features though, so I may break down and get another one. It's pretty fast to load the menus and is pretty easy to operate overall."
1,Garbage,"This lasted for 6 discs before refusing to play blu rays again. It's out of warranty, so tough luck for me. This is my last Samsung product."
4,Great Player,"I searched for a long time for a blu-ray player that would stream video and play a variety of video types, including Divx movies. I also didn't want anything that I felt was overpriced. This player has been exceptional. Easy to set-up and stream Netflix. I am having so much fun downloading and looking at really bad movies rather than wasting my subscription by having them sent home. I didn't have any problem with the sound, but I play all of my sound through my Sony receiver. I think this is a great player for the money."
1,Poor Performance,"I bought this player the end of December and it worked great out of the box. I connected it to my Samsung hdtv via hdmi cable. Now in April, the player will not display on the tv. I checked the connections and tried different hdmi ports. The source menu on the tv recognizes that the player is there, but it will not display it. I guess it's too late to return it now too."
4,Excellent player,I bought this player at Target on sale for 129.00 two days ago. My PS3 died on me so I needed to get another bluray player since my PS3 will be gone for about two weeks. I searched and searched I came across this beauty. I watched Batman (1989) and Inception amazing quality it upconverts dvd quite well. I haven't tried streaming Netflix or other applications on it yet.I give it four stars for one reason. The problem I have is it freezes at times. You can press pause on a movie and it'll freeze which means you have to restart the player. It also takes long to load. Other than that this is a very good bluray player worth the money for sure.
1,"Nice features, poor customer satisfaction",This is a nice player that unfortunately does not show much care for the customers.I bought it because it has a usb plug for wifi connection to my router. What a nasty surprise I got when I found out that it will not accept any of my wireless wifi usb sticks. Samsung forces you to buy their proprietary usb stick.It will cost you another $70 dls. or 60% of the player's price.WHAT A RIP OFFI can not recommend Samsung products for this reason. I will buy them when they show a little more care for their customers and less greediness.
1,Promising but lacks some basic features,"This player is good depending on what you need from it.Pros:1. Loads USB drives/DVD/Blu Ray pretty fast.2. Can Read NTFS USB drives too. Big plus.3. Can play most of hi def MKV files.Cons:1. Cannot do a fast forward on the *.mkv files on DVD. It can do fast forward If I play the same mkv file from USB drive. I can't believe in 21st century, fast forward feature will not work. Normal DVD fast forward works.I returned mine just because of this reason.2. DLNA doesn't work. Don't waste your time trying to make it work."
1,BROKEN,This was a Valentines gift for my boyfriend. He was so excited to receive it and then his dreams shattered in one minute. We turned it on and the door where you put your blu-ray disc in did not open all the way. Once we got the disc in it said that it was unable to read disc and we just bought the blu-ray disc! I am very unhappy and my boyfriend is still crying in his pillow as we speak! This is going back!
1,UN HAPPY CUSTOMER,I PURCHASED A SAMSUNG BLUE RAY PLAYER A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO .... EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL FEBRUARY ... ANY BLUE RAY DISKS THAT CAME OUT AFTER JANUARY OF 2011 WILL NOT PLAY ON MY SAMSUNG BLUE RAY PLAYER BECAUSE SAMSUNG HAS NOT UPDATED THEIR FIRMWARE. I HAVE SINCE CANCELLED MY BLUE RAY DISKS FROM NETFLIX SINCE THEY WONT PLAY ON MY PLAYER ... SO BEWARE AS TIME GOES ON YOUR PLAYER COULD ALSO BECOME OBSOLETE.
2,Disappointing coming from Samsung,"This product was a complete disappointment. We bought it because we trusted the Samsung name and were so pleased with our Samsung LED TV. From the very beginning this product had many ""bugs"". It would often freeze up when we tried to play a DVD or when we tried to watch movies via the internet streaming. Many times it wouldn't even read the disc. Finally after growing tired of battling the blu ray player every time we wanted to watch a movie, we returned the product."
1,Actual use is terrible,"This product is very unstable despite several ""updates"". Do not use with Netfix, as it is unstable and you won't enjoy the movie. Internet is fine, DVD player is the problem. I would not purchase this product."
2,Not a high quality device,"This device makes you second guess if your blue ray dvd's are damaged. I put in the dvd and it says ""error loading"". I take it out and put it back in and then it loads. Sometimes the blue ray movie will freeze towards the end so perhaps the device is overheating. I have about 20 brand new blue rays and the device has trouble with most of them.The online software and menus are ok, not great. Samsung should outsource the their software to Microsoft or someone that specializes in software. Then they can focus on hardware quality control. Samsung gets this right with most of their products just not blue ray players."
1,Dead out of the box,Samsung support was little to no help. In fact I came away feeling as though they put the blame on me for the Blu Ray player not working. Amazon took care of the problem without question and sent a new player along with a return shipping label.
1,Won't play Blueray discs,"I'm very disapointed with my BD-C5500 player. I paid top dollar compared to other players on the market. The player gave me problems off and on since I bought it,had and still have problems playing Blueray discs. If I put regular DVD's in then it plays. If I try to update the firmware it won't let me using a Cd or flash drive,so I hooked up the internet direct and it says no updates available but the web site says they're available. I think it's a waste of money.I also bought a cheaper LG player for half the price and it plays great. Never a problem."
1,"Poor, look elsewhere",Problems playing Blu-ray discs:1. Extremely slow loading discs.2. Doesn't always resume playback if disc stopped - must start from the beginning and fast forward.3. Doesn't properly play some Blu-ray discs such as Midnight in Paris which had no audio track.Returning for a Sony or Panasonic.
2,Don't buy Samsung,"Bought one of these just six months ago. One day would not turn on and I had ongoing issue with dvd's cutting out and getting a black or blue screen. Called Samsung and had to send at my own expense to Long Beach, Ca. Just got it back and it will turn on but still having problems playing dvd's. If you're looking for streaming video just by a player throught netflix and save some money and hassle. Samsung service is inconvenient and lacks communication as to what they are actually doing.All the fancy apps. in the world don't mean a difference if it won't turn on or it's gone for weeks getting alleged service.I learned my lesson and will never buy another Samsung product as long as I live."
1,WORST PURCHASE EVER!,"This is absolutely the worst piece of electronics I have ever purchased. Sure it plays blu-rays but the internet connection is pitiful. The picture quality of blu-ray is only part of the experience. The streaming media is really more of the experience these days. First, you have to buy their wifi adapter--another $40. Then it reverts back to wired internet every 5 minutes. Trying to watch a half hour show and you need to switch it back to wifi, turn it off, reboot...sometimes every two minutes. Just garbage--extremely frustrating. Spend a few extra buck and get a better machine. This one stinks!"
2,Typically Samsung,"Samsung sent me this model after lots of phone calls to customer service, three postal returns, and failed repairs couldn't solve the problems with an earlier model. This worked for about six months before it started to demonstrate a host of issues: the counter reset itself; it kept dropping the Netflix connection; and the player kept losing track of where it had last stopped in a movie. Rather than go through customer service again (which veered between kindly helpless and confrontative), I opted for a new machine and brand. If your machine works, god bless you; but if you need Samsung's service, god help you."
3,A little quirky. Does not work with Amazon videos. Good with Netflix,"I realize this is a pretty budget Blu-ray player and we're reasonably satisfied. However, the operation of the unit is sometimes quirky in that you can't get it to return to the previous menu on occasion. One time it ended up in some weird state where I could not get any menus or DVD's/Blu-rays to work. Power on off did not help. I had to physically unplug it from the wall and then replug it to get it working.No support for Amazon streaming. However, the Netflix works well. You can browse all the Netflix titles or access your instant queue. I read some other players will just let you access your Netflix instant queue and you end up running back and forth to your PC and the other player.All in all, I thinnk I should have coughed up the cash and purchased another PS3 since the PS3 has been rock solid and is very flexible as far as apps, games, DLNA, etc."
4,Samsung does it well,The unit plays reg dvd beautifully but haven't tried Bluray yet. MLB widget has too many stoppages & freeze ups. May not be units fault as I also have some of those streaming problems using my computer. All said it is very convient to hit a few buttons & have my NYY game on with YES in New Hampshire my new home state.The rest of the widgets that I have tried work well.
2,Very slow Netflix,"I purchased this for my Sony LCD a year and a half ago. Since then I have grown frustrated with the menu select delay in the netflix interface. The delay is 5-10 seconds and is rather annoying. Blu rays are not a clear as Sony. Some DVD will freeze. Best advice,pair Sony with Sony devices. I just got Sony s590 and see less delay and better picture quality."
1,Constantly freezes when playing blu ray discs,"Bought this over two years ago, and only have a handful of blu ray discs. Works well for other tasks but will be buying another player since it does not play blu ray discs without freezing during playback. Loud clunking noises from the disc player and terrible playback experience. Customer service is a joke, they told me that unplugging the HDMI would fix it. (It did not.) Surprised at the positive reviews on this product, but suspect they do not use it for blu ray discs."
4,Great unit for the price,Bought this a month ago as a secondary bedroom blu-ray and it works great. Much faster than my older Samsung unit. Netflix downloads faster and is clearer for some reason even though software has been updated on older model. Did have to update software on this one out of the box upon setup but did not take to long. Amazon had the best price and I received quickly. Would highly recommend.
2,Hard to skip previews,The player works ok if you never ever want to skip the previews. If you love watching all the adds that come with disks and do not mind waiting 15 min or so to start the movie buy this player. Actually most samsung players are like this. They generate nice video output. But they make it almost impossible to skip the previews. I hate being forced to watch all the previews so it drives me up the wall. They disable the ff and skip button along with all the menu options. Ie they are a good licensee and not a company for me.
2,DEAD OUT OF THE BOX,It's hard to rate an item that was dead out of the box... I really needed it for a specific purpose (A GIFT) and had to run to a local Walmart and pay more money for a simailar item.... It's frustrating... The least that Samsung could do is test it before it ships to a retailer...
1,Wireless LAN ready is a flat out lie!,"The only reason to use the words ""Wireless LAN ready"" is to fool people into thinking it is, only to find out after buying it that it is not and you have to purchase a $70 adapter for wireless to work."
1,Garbage,I've owned three Samsung Blu Ray players this unit would not even get to the setup screen.Worst piece of garbage ever! Will never buy another Samsung product ever...
5,Just what you need for bluray,"Like most of the reviews I have read it is great! It does everything you need it to do and does just what it says it will do. If you have a Samsung TV with the extra link feature you will not be disappointed, I'm not.Thanks Amazon and Amazon merchants for a good deal and fast delivery."
1,Very Misleading!,"This device will not play BR movies from your computer to your TV. If your looking for strickly an internet portal for you TV, its an OK device. I'm going to re-wrap it and give it to someone I don't like for X-mas!"
1,"No Apple Support, no Hulu Plus","I have a Samsung plasma TV, and bought this player because it integrates incredibly well with it using a nice single remote. Very happy.BUT the built-in PC connection is only for Windows computers. No love for Apple owners. So a big piece of functionality stares at me, unusable, because Samsung doesn't play at all with Apple. Very unhappy.AND this player does play some digital content, like Netflix, very nicely. BUT It does not play the new Hulu Plus. For that you need a Samsung 3D player, even though Hulu is not 3D. Double extra unhappy."
1,dlna /allshare total failure,Bought this for the dlna/allshare feature to be able to stream from my phone hd video to the device.. it doesnt work for squat.. it sees the phone and lets me browse videos.. starts playing one then freezes up and minutes later jumps to the next/wrong video.this is with a samsung phone with allshare.. their own companies products dont play together.
2,Great product with a great catch.,"I just bought this product. Looks nice and slick. However, the box says it is wireless ready but they don't include the adapter. Even worse, you can't use another adapter than a Samsung. On top of that, the damn adapter costs $80, where you can get a regular adapter for $15!That's not an honest strategy from Samsung. And even though I can afford the adapter, I will return the product."
3,Samsung B-Ray Player Review,"Good cost-benefit product. Fast disc upload, simple and beautiful. The only one drawback is the remote control - it could be more functional and its design is awful."
2,the little ray that wouldnt,The first Blu-Ray disk I purchased wanted an upgrade to the firmware and there isnt anything on samsung's website higher than what I have.The network broke after 3 weeks and no no Netflix.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone
1,"Vudu, Netflix do NOT work","I bought this player primarily for the Netflix and Vudu access... neither worked. I used a wired network connection which tests just fine. I can ping the Samsung from a pc on my home network continuously with no drops. However, when trying to activate Vudu, Netflix, or even doing the software upgrade I get various messages telling me ""Network Connection has been lost"". I wasted about 2 hours trying to get this thing working with no luck. I'm taking it back first thing in the morning... If you want this simply for playing Blu Ray discs then I guess it's okay. But if you are looking for any of the streaming services, do not purchase this product!!!"
4,Easy to use blu-ray player.,"This player was easy to set up. I thought it would connect to my system wireless, but it doesn't. I had a bridge connected to my older blu-ray player so it wasn't a problem. The only thing I've had a problem with was I had to set the display to 720. When it was set on automatic playing would stop and start and there was a bright flashing going on during play. The other problem is I still haven't figured out how to get to my Picasa account, but maybe that's just me. Has a great picture and streaming Vudu was fantastic, although expensive for a streaming movie."
3,Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-ray,I have owned this device for about 8 months now. In this time I have watched DVDs and Blu-ray. It is an excellent disc player. The up-scale capability is second to none. The one thing that's keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating is: at least twice a week my wife or I have to reactivate with NetFlix. Today is the third day in a roll I have completed this process. We keep a lap top next to the TV so we want have to leave the room to do this. Now with that aside I must also say we get DVD quality streaming video while watching movies via NetFlix. (on a 16 mbps down load) If you want good video quality and don't mind a little extra work to watch NetFlix on your TV this is a great player.
2,Don't waste your money,"After I got this, I wish I hadn't. I had to configure the player in order to play DVDs, a feature that should have been set before I opened the box. Worked fine for a few months after that, but then started acting up. The player makes a whining noise while playing many DVDs and BDs, but not all. It also beeps and makes awful noises through the speakers when the disc tray is open. And it started turning subtitles on by itself and the only way I could turn it off is by shutting down the player then opening and closing the disc tray.Samsung in general has been going down in quality over the past few years. If I were you, I would buy a different brand."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product is awful. I thought it would be nice to watch movies from my PC on my tv and to have apps to view Facebook, the weather, Hulu etc. You can't watch Hulu on this model. To download the ""free"" apps you have to register on the Samsung website where they REQUIRE a credit card, even if you only want to download the free apps. What a joke. The picture is not any better than my old DVD player. Not worth it at all. I returned this the next day. By the way, the Samsung website won't let you post a review unless it is 4 stars or more. I will not buy any of their products in the future."
2,Freezes up frequently,"This player is fairly inexpensive, but it shows. It freezes up frequenly during movies, and a whole lot during Netflix streaming. The interface is sloppy, and poorly designed. They really did not think this one through. Good price though. Not sure it is worth the aggrivation."
4,Great Player,"This player arrived in a timely fashion. Works best with a Samsung LCD. The remote already recognizes the commands on the TV, so you can use the blu-ray remote to control TV too."
3,Refurbished Blu-Ray Player,"I ordered this refurbished Blu-Ray from the Amazon Marketplace at a very good price. It arrived in a timely fashion but in setting it up I discovered the remote was defective. When I called Tech-for-Less they agreed with my assessment, apologized, and sent me a replacement remote. That one worked fine and I am now happy with my purchase. They were quick to solve the problem but if they just had better quality control this would not have happened."
1,started failing not long after the return policy expired,"the player started making a very loud noise and failing only a few months after I bought the drive, unfortunately it was already after the extremely short return window had expired, this was a bad purchase decision"
4,More than I expected,I just received my player so I may edit this review later but here are my first impressions. The setup and software update were easy and intuitive. I installed samsung's pc share manager and was playing my HD video in under an hour. This is a good product.
2,Shop around for better players.,"This player has serious problems with audio going out of sync on non disc video files. I bought THE player exclusively for playing back stuff like AVI and MKV only to realize that 9 out of 10 of my videos had sync problem that do not occur when playing back on the PC.It functions well enough as a DVD/Bluray player, but not much else.Samsung support did not return my email about the issue and the latest firmware doesn't fix the issue.I would not recommend this player."
2,Only buy this knowing you will have to buy $60 Samsung LAN adapter,"I looked around and read all of the reviews for this product and the information on the Samsung site. Unfortunately I missed the hundreds of please for help online from people who were trying to have a wired Ethernet connection from their wireless router to their blu-ray player. There really are complaints after complaints from people who say their internet provider won't give them the manual network install information after the blu-ray player's auto detection of the settings only provides information that can't let them access Netflix, firmware updates, etc. I had the same issue, contacted cable internet provider and they said reboot the modem. I called Samsung support twice and they said just buy the Samsung LAN adapter, the lowest price for which I found was $60. Plus tax, the entire setup would be around $170 and not the $99 price you are seeing here. I lodged a complaint."
1,Audio sync issues,As a cheap blu-ray player I was not hoping for much. Been having issues with the audio being out of sync with the video. This happens both with surround sound through my stereo and when using the tv speakers with the audio piped directly from HDMI. I'd avoid this one.
2,Don't buy for Avatar,"I bought this unit because of features and fair price. I was excited to play Avatar. If that is your intent DO NOT BUY this unit!!!!!My trouble started when first installing the unit. It would not connect to the internet. Only after I did first firmware update did it connect to the internet. I have never been able to load the BD version of avatar. The unit indicates an update is required to play the movie. I waited patiently for the next update. It arrive this week over the internet - at least one thing worked. But unfortunately, the Avatar will still not play.The problem appears to be with the Avatar movie. The Disc plays flawlessly in a PS3. This unit also plays other BD discs without problem. But DONT BUY this unit if you want to play Avatar."
1,did not work,This blu ray player did not work for me at all. I would put in a disc and it would clunk around and then shut off. Boo. It was probably damaged in shipment though.
2,Misleading Product ---- Wireless feature sold SEPARATELY,"The box boasts WiFi to watch streaming, netflix etc. They don't mention that the wireless adapter to use your new ""WiFi"" blue ray will run you an extra 80$. Total rip off. I already had to spend an extra 40$ for the unincluded HDMI cable. These companies should be required to say the box is not WiFi compatible on its own. Why care about the consumers, right? I cant rate its features, just know that all you get in the box is the player and remote. You pay a ""great price"" but in reality you end up spending an extra 150$ for the things to actually do what its advertised to do."
2,"Good features, good price, poor overall experience","Samsung makes products with a good feature list, but obviously lacks expertise in user experience design.There are too many small issues with this device to list them all -- such as the HDMI protocol crashing because it is not being quite compatible with my LG LCD television, the shape of the CD tray making it tricky to pick up disks, and the obnoxious jingle that plays every time the player is turned on.As for the internet services, other than the Netflix player, the rest seems to mostly be junk -- such as clunky games.Overall this device is as slick as a PC running Windows 2.0I eventually returned it and got theSony BDP-S370 Blu-ray Disc Player-- which is simply a pleasure to use."
2,It's not what I thought it would be. A citrusy bug spray furniture polish.,"I read reviews by others that said the same thing, but when I bought it for my niece, it smelled great and she's young so it smelled great on her. But on me it just was overpowering. I'd say it's great for the young but not for women over 40."
4,Not bad,"This dvd starts out a little slow, however, in the end, I understand the structure of saddles enough to make a very informed decision. I especially enjoyed the live horse demonstration. I recommend this video."
3,Early 50's Roy Rogers,"I should begin by stating that I lived and worked in Saigon for 8 yearsin the 90's. My experience will therefore be different from many otherviewers.The film effectively conveys the kinetic pace of Saigon, especially inthe later 90's, and the sense, if not the details, of how the low level,cyclo based,""mob"" exists and operates.While at times it was dead on, at other times it portrayed things thatwere culturaly ludicrous. Cyclo's don't have clean white t-shirts, prostitutes don't dance in evening gowns, and nobody would haveaccess to or wear a handcuff. There were many other little things thatdidn't fit, from Saigon idioms/accent to relationships and settings.So while I found the film disconcerting, like trying to use Roy Rogersto portray the American West, for those unfimailiar with Vietnam itis an idealized starting point and could be of some interest."
2,Very Overated,"I saw this film in the theater when it was released in 1996. I'm a fan of the genre, and enjoyed the directors previous film, ""The Scent of Green Papaya."" For me, this film doesn't measure up to those standards. It comes across as a random collection of scenes and images with a storyline sprinkled in. While there can be a beauty in that, this was the only movie I've ever seen where I honestly breathed a sigh of relief when it ended."
5,Cyclo ... The Viet Nam by the Vietnamese,"Cyclo is not an usual movie : it's a movie about Viet Nam, Vietnamese people, about suffering, wondering, being lost and being saved, about desperation and hope, about love and frustration .. but all is perfectly mastered and controlled by Tran Anh Hung.The film is about the ordinary life in Viet Nam, about hard times, struggle, the temptation of money and corruption ... violence and tenderness.It is probably as of today the most accomplishd vision of modern Viet Nam, the most ""insight journey"" into the soul of Vietnamese, and as such, it's not an easy movie : for each scene, you need to wonder ""what is the message"", ""what doe sthat mean"" : behind the story, there are messages and analysis about the human being and their path.Cyclo shall be a delightful movie for those who love Viet Nam and who want to feel and to understand its destiny, at a time where it stand at a crossroad.On top of that, the movie keeps beautiful scene ful of peotry and beauty."
3,whacked out,Little more than a collection of whacked out imagery showing someone's idea of a descent into human hell. No real plot or sense to what happens. I guess that's all it takes to win a Golden Lion.
5,This movie is an African American classic worth owning!,"I watched this movie in the 90's and convinced my family to watch it, as well. Movie is well-told and heart felt. It convinced me to begin researching and documenting my own family tree. Thus far, I've researched back to my great great grandparents! As far as I know I'm the first,in my family, to commit it to writing.I encourage anyone, especially of African American descent, to not only watch this movie but own it."
4,Eye Opener,I watched this film in African Culture class (spr 06) and it opened my eyes up to who I am as a black man and the fact that I AM KING
3,FREEBIRD,I been trying to watch this film for years and found it on amazon. It moves slow but very dramatic tale on slavery and freedom.It actually rivals the roots series. It would been more impactful with better actors. Overall I enjoyed it. This film is also a good resource for those involve in African American studies.
5,"Excellent movie, Everything I thought it would be and more","I enjoyed this DVD.In fact I was able to get my wife to watch and she liked it also.If you're interested in Afrocentic values or black history. This is a good movie to watch.For the person in school studying African American history, you should include this in your studies."
5,GREAT,"GREAT MOVIE, I HAVE WATCHED SANKOFA 5 TIMES. IT IS GOOD EVERY SINGLE TIME. I BOUGHT IT TO SHARE WITH MY FAMILY."
4,Another tail light,"Well, I hope that I don't whack this one with my lawn mower, like I did the first one. At least this one was a perfect match for the light that I didn't 'kill'."
5,Just what I've come to expect,"""Wellington's Peninsula Regiments"" is exactly what I've come to expect from the ""Men-At-Arms"" series. It has superb drawings and details. I've been purchasing Osprey Books since the old days of nicely drawn but stiff and highly static pictures. Now any drawn graphics show the subjects in action and as they would have looked at the time. Overall an excellent volume and highly recommended."
4,griots beneath the baobab - tales from los angeles,"More, more, more. This book brought back many memories for me.Thank you."
5,Great Bulbs!,"I love these bulbs! They are more powerful than the stock bulbs I had in my SUV and so far have lasted me for 6 months. According to website research, they are more long lasting than the Sylvania Silverstars and also don't have that nagging blue-white glare problem that those bulbs have.I have used them on dark, rainy Northwest nights to light up the roads and they have served me well. Highly recommended."
4,Working Lights,"I was looking for a brighter set of lights and this set filled the bill. Just remember to clear/clear the Headlight lens before comparing the difference. If you don't know how to clear up your headlight that have gone yellow over time do a search on youtube for ""yellow headlights"" to find out how you clean them up. Drive safely and illuminated at night."
3,For The Young,"The second part of the title, ""How Young Widows And Widowers Cope and Heal"" is in small type on the cover of the book and I didn't see it before I bought the book.Although this book has several suggestions on how to deal with the death of a spouse or partner, it is definately for younger people who have very different problems and solutions in order to recover from the loss of a loved one.I also thought the book was shallow. For the most part it merely reiterates conversations from recovery groups. Actually going to a recovery group will do much more for you than reading this book.""How To Deal With The Loss Of A Love"" and ""Bad Things Happen To Good People"" are much better."
5,great grief book,"I think of this book as the ""bible"" for new widows. It doesn't tell you anything you don't already know, but makes you understand that what you are going thru is NORMAL - you are not losing your mind!! And you are going to make it! So many of my widowed friends loved this book as well. I loan it out or recommend it to any newly widowed persons I come in contact with. It's a quick read also, because you can relate to it so much."
5,great book,Great book for young widows. Many books are aimed towards older widows. This book hits the nail right on hte head. A must read.
5,Emptiness explained,"The 9 sutras under section II titled as Emptiness are really good. It is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in Mahayana. The sutras clearly indicate the pathless path. It is a valuable guide for the Mahayana meditation. Mr.Chang has done a neat translation keeping the flavour of the original theme intact. Those who are already familiar with the Mahayana ""viewless view"" are sure to immensly benefit from these sutras."
4,Interesting Reading!,"Normally I'm don't read much history...but this book really was very interesting. The way it is written is timeless, very intelligent, informative, and enjoyable! If you like medieval history, you will enjoy this."
5,Buen producto,Producto excelente y buen estado entregado a tiempo y en condiciones óptimas altamente recomendado el vendedor y con buena credibilidad
5,Red All Stars,"Three year old ""LOVES"" these shoes. Wants to wear them to bed.Arrived on time in perfect condition and the price was excellent."
4,I purchased this as a dog toy,"Shoes were on sale for almost nothing and I purchased them as a dog toy, My Husky puppy loves it"
4,"weaker legacy entry, but still amazing...","I have to say first, in response to an earlier review, ""A Page of Life"" is one of the very best joy electric songs to date. Definitely best of the album. this one's different.first let me say that joy e is possibly my favorite band, they never cease to amaze and entertain me. this album is probably my least favorite of the legacy series. i think i find the synth arrangements a little less appealing although they are still very intricately put together. this one is darker than the past couple but i would say ""ministry of archers"" is more perfected ""dark"" album while ""mannequin"" has a little more trouble evoking a specific theme. not that, as all joy e albums, it doesn't work well as an album. just not quite as focused. other great tracks: ""wolf in the bend"", ""i am a pioneer"" and ""song for all time""."
3,Athena,"Athena Massey is one of my favorite B-movie actresses and I thought this was perhaps her shot at going legit. Possibly a rare gem adorned with low budget type sci-fi philosophy. But no, this is as much a showcase for Athena's breasts as it is her acting ability.Fun if you're already a fan but a truly terrible film otherwise."
4,For those of you looking for love,"Yes,yes. The ever elusive cover song ""Get Down Make Love"" is found on this disc. NIN, the masters of cool b-sides and hidden tracks were in full force when they decided to cover this old Queen song. The only thing better than actually fining this disc was nice low price of it! Mad props to Amazon!! Now if I can only find the live version of #99 (How does it feel? SUCK! SUCK! SUCK!) from Wish. Later!"
2,Redundant release saved by a rarity,Who cares about the 3 versions of Sin - you can hear the song on the album. Having said that I quite like the Queen cover Get Down Make Love mainly for the production values of Al Jourgensen ( yes he's Hypo Luxa ). It's still interesting and although Trent's vocals almost ruin the song - the song is saved due to Al's top production skills ( something Trent could use a hand with )
5,"Great single, But buy the vinyl","This is a great single, probably one of the best that Trent has put out (not as good as the into the void single though, i think that one really deserved a halo). The ""short"" remix is the best on here, and a lot of people think it is the way the song should have originally been. I would tend to agree. The cover of Queen's ""get down make love"" is better than the original, unlike other cover songs by NIN that spring to mind (memorabilia, anyone?). If you are going to buy this single, make sure you get the CD AND THE VINYL. Nothing records recently announced they are going to stop making the sin vinyl, so it should be a hot item soon. very soon. A great single all in all, i highly reccomend it."
2,Just the beginning...,"While Pretty Hate Machine is a great album, it didn't really present us with anything new and amazing, electronic music was what the 1980's was all about. But it did mark the beginning of Trent Reznor's rise to stardom. While I don't feel Sin is one of the stronger tracks on Pretty Hate Machine it wasn't an altogether bad single either. My only complain is the alternative mixes on here are poor and not that much different (were they mixes he did after the fact or were they mixes that were in contention for making it on Pretty Hate Machine?) However the cover of Get Down Make Love is great and the sole reason I bought the single. However I cannot give it more than 2 stars, especially looking ahead at Fixed and Further Down The Spiral (yes the two remix albums) and The Downward Spiral for that matter."
4,if you love Sugarcane...............,"Waht a great talent Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris was. Too bad he is no longer with us. I first heard him on the Frank Zappa ""Hot Rats"" album way, way back in the early 70's. Later on I discovered ""Don and Dewey"", who were two great R&B artists from Pasadena. Later on, I heard Sugarcane's great stuff he recorded with Johnny Otis and John Mayall. This CD, along with ""Pure Food and Drug Act"", rounds it all out. A couple of the cuts on this CD are a bit weak, but listening to the sweet sounds laid down by Sugarcane makes up for it."
5,"Powerful images, delicately written about","This book is a collection of poems from ""Under Stars,"" ""Instructions to the Double,"" ""Willingly,"" and several dozen new poems. It's lovely, a joy to read. My favorites are from ""Under Stars,"" and the poem ""Under Stars,"" is worth the price of the book itself. Tess Gallagher's poems are stunning and strong, with such delicate phrasing. A must-read if you enjoy poetry."
2,Printing takes up one side of the file???,"This would have been a much better purchase had the COVER been imprinted and not the nailfile...The RAISED white print on the file makes one side utterly useless unless you want to be filing and the HUMP -- up you go on a raised letter and then NO SPACE to file... the raised printing means I only get HALF the file to use on MY nails,... the other side is basically for THEIR advertising space!!!Bad usage of a product that could have been an ok choice... not stellar, as it wears soon on regular nails, but cheap and ok if you could use BOTH sides for the price!!But I feel deceived since ALL other files I have ever purchased allowed me to use both sides for the money!!!Not Lady Gaga's purseTropical Shine * Washable #707301 Fine Pink File..."
1,J'adore ... more like NOT,"I think its a fake.. :/ I usually buy it from a department store however decided to buy from amazon. THe bottle LOOKS the same but there is a sticker in the bottom of the bottle, the original has no sticker! Also,the smell does not last as long."
2,can hardly smell the scent,i had smelled the scent before and used it before. my guess is it may be old because the scent is very week.even when i put on more then enough. this was my very 1st time using Amazon and i would like to return it.
2,Not sure this was from a reputable source.,"I ordered this as a replacement since my last bottle was almost empty. SO, I have used this perfume for years and I know what it should smell like, feel like, etc.My order came within a few days just as promised. However, upon opening it and spraying it, it was oily. It left a greasy film on my skin and didn't smell as fragrant as a previous bottle I purchased at Dillard's about a year ago.Upon further inspection, the bottle was mailed standard USPS from a Julio Flores of Elizabeth NJ. Not a reputable company as I thought I was ordering from.I'm not sure what I purchased was authentic J'adore by Dior. To all future buyers, BEWARE!"
1,J'Adore Eau de Parfum doesn't smell or look like the regular one !,"The three bottles of J'Adore, Eau de Parfum Spray from Christian Dior arrived very quickly, but I just opened my three bottles and I discovered that the top it's not at the same material that the regular bottles and, most importantly, they DON'T SMELL like J'Adore Eau de Parfum. I'm very disappointed. All this for 80 $ the bottle !!!!!! What to do now?"
4,Must Have,"This perfume is a must have. It is romantic warm fragrance that smells good on almost everyone. I would recommend it be worn as an evening fragrance. It may be too strong for daytime wear. I have used this perfume for years, and it never goes out of style. It is a classic. It would be a great gift! The bottle is great too."
5,The best women's fragrance,"I ordered this Parfum Spray for my mother. Wow! I got it within 4 days(I use Super Saver Shipping). I'd like to say it smells great and stay a long time. Thanks, amazon for great shopping!"
2,seems counterfeit (copy),"I have bought this perfume before and anyone could tell my wife was wearing it, it stayed on her skin, This ONE i bought only smell wen you put it on. i am very dessapointed. it seems to be a copy. i guess that is why it was cheap. And i'm not talking about the brand, Jadore is one of the best out there, my next purchase will be at JCP."
1,Buyer Beware,I purchased the 3.4 ounces Eau De Parfum Spray and received 3.4 ounces of Deodorant Parfum instead. I am very upset that the deodorant parfum is half the price of the Eau De Parfum Spray. Be aware of this and go to your mall and buy this product.
4,Good Book--Last of the Series,"This final book of this particular family saga is primarily about Iris & Theo and their family. It tells how Paul helped them and how Iris never found out that he was her biological father. I really liked this book because it was about the characters I liked best. Belva Plain is a wonderful author if you are not in a rush. Her books have depth to them and lots of detail that make the characters come to life.Karen Zemek, author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
2,Book Condition and Delivery,I received this book in the promised delivery time however the book was in very poor condition. I understand the price does not guarantee condition but out of all the books I ordered on that day this was the only one in bad condition.
2,PAIN AND NOT WORTH $$$$,"I have put together a lot of furniture in my time, and this was the hardest one yet. 6 hours it took me. Not only is it flimsy wood, I had to modify the very bad directions. The second half of the bed (bottom section where body goes) was way lower than the top. So it would have been slanted if I hadn't of moved it up a hole. So only one bolt is holding it up and not 2. The boards that go right under the mattress were suppose to be screwed in, but they didnt even budge with an electric screw driver. It just made dings in the wood. It looks as though it is already cracking where one of the bolts is screwed in. I emailed the company and have heard nothing back. We shall see how it holds up. I wouldn't pick this again even if it is really cute! I gave it 2 stars because at the moment it is working, and maybe I was un lucky and just got a badly made one. Just beware if you do buy it."
1,Don't purchase this bed!!!,"I purchased this bed only to find that the bolts provided are too short. I should have known something was up when the first thing I saw on the instructions were the words ""if something is wrong, don't return the bed to the store, email or call us at..."" Well, I emailed and explained the situation (which I'm sure they were well aware of already) and I received a prompt response stating that the new nuts and bolts would be sent to me within two weeks (that's right, two weeks to rectify a situation they are well aware of). Well, it's been nearly three weeks and still no nuts and bolts. Now I have to repackage the thing and haul it back to the store. What a pain!!!!"
4,For people who love Home Theatre,"This product is for people who really care about their home theatre, it's not really for people who just want a way to connect this to their stereo. Although the power cord that comes with it is pretty handy since it's basically an extension cord that allows you plug the airport express in and place the actual unit away from the plug. If all you care about is just connecting it to your stereo then just use the RCA cables that come with it. If you are really into your home theatre I would say these cables are a definite must for connecting the airport express to it"
2,Wish I had known there were cheaper cables when I was looking for this.,The quality is good and matches other white components.HOWEVERThere are cheaper options on amazon and elsewhere. Look around and save yourself some money.
3,"""Monster""s indeed","If you are completely helpless with audio, this may be an option. But using ""Monster Cable"" to play MP3s (or most consumer audio, for that matter) is a bad choice. Very few people could -measure- the advantages of ""Monster"" cable, let alone hear it.Standard audio cables these days are plenty good enough for nearly everyone -- unless you're a top-of-the-line studio -- at 1/4 of the price. Gold plated -- if you want something that makes some sense -- helps avoid noise from corrosion.(How do I know? 45 years of experience with electronics and audio, a couple licenses and a degree)"
1,That's it? A $6 dollar cable and a $14 cable?,"I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables. Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper. Just ridiculous. The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini."
1,Not needed,Cheaper to go to Radio Shack or most stereo stores and get exactly what you want of equal quality at a lower price.
3,Waste of money if you don't need ALL the cables.,I realized quickly I had spent way too much money when I ended up putting all of the cables except for the digital one back in the box and putting in storage. Doh!
3,great accessory cables,"I'm not sure how ""battery life"" applies to a set of cables.. but it's in the ""attributes"" list.This is a power cord and set of cables. The cord replaces the wall-wart style OEM plug. The other cables allow you to plug the Airport into your stereo, into either RCA jacks or a TOSLink (laser ooptic cable thingy). I'm using the TOSLink (less cables to mess with).It's nice to be able to move the appliance off of the wall, and the other cables are handy for connecting to your stereo. I have no complaints at all."
3,Expensive...but good,"Hey, you can get it cheaper...but monster cable for the Airport has everything you need and you know it's goin work...."
5,An original epic!,"Antonio de Nicolas, the philosopher and poet, has written a very original epic based on his own life experience. I recommend it strongly!"
5,one of the great musical events,it was 1977 and my wife & i were lucky enough to be in rio at the concert. a giant quonset hut of a building. two stages. dancing. drinking. dining. what a nite to remember. breath taking. the music of the evening will never leave our heads (and bodies). everything mr rodrigues says about the recoring is absolutly true. one of the great musical events i've ever been to...and i've been to many.
5,Fast-paced intriguing mystery,"I enjoyed this fast-paced mystery. It begins by pulling the reader into the lives of honest, good people linked to a horrible past. The many short chapters keep the momentum alive as the book dips into character-building flashbacks. The author keeps you guessing at every page and delivers an intense ending that ties together a diverse group of characters.My favorite aspect of this book was how it made me feel about the characters. Some were clearly good, and some clearly bad. How these characters interacted with more 'conflicted' characters made the book quite interesting to me."
4,I'll never look at my spice rack the same way again.,"One of my favorite things to read is the history of something coupled with great story telling. This book achieves that in a more comprehensive way than most schlocky templated airport books and more entertainingly than a dry books written by true academic experts on a given subject.The author will drop lines like ""So this voyage around the world was paid for by some cloves""...I'm paraphrasing, but that line sticks out as one that reflects how the author will recount a holistic angle of some historical occurrences, and then boil it down to such a satisfying line.I definitely recommend this book for night reading or an airplane read. Some parts of the book are less interesting depending on what parts of history you like best."
5,A Little Bit Of Everything.,"This is a nice, well written history of spices and their effects on humanity. Much of the book deals with the spice races of the 1400s and 1500s and the impact on the world and on Europe's rising power. Other sections deal with spices and their roles in history, cooking, romance, politics, religion, and war. The book is not arranged chronologically but instead in broad categories devoted to spices' various uses.Turner is scholarly but also witty and informal in his writing. You will learn a lot and also have a lot of fun while reading his book."
3,Ok but not a home run,"This book contains a tremendous amount of interesting information...but I think it's poorly organized and thus repetitive. The author riffs on this or that aspect of his subject, and his trajectory pulls him to tell the same story over and over again in slightly different words. I think the book could have been much tighter and stronger. (I prefer Kurlansky's history of salt and the book about the history of the world in six drinks.) But Spice does contain a tremendous amount of interesting information."
3,Not nearly as good as Salt,"There are many interesting tidbits in this book but unfortunately it is poorly organized. Rather than recounting history chronologically or geographically or even by spice, the author chose to go by use (culinary, medicinal, etc.). Thus it is very hard to remember what you've just read because the story jumps around so much. Unless you plan to take notes, I would highly recommendSalt: A World Historyinstead for those interested in tales of another highly sought after ingredient."
3,"Very informative, but bogs down in repetition","This is an extremely well-researched book and is brimming with all sorts of interesting anecdotes and historical analysis. It's obvious an enormous amount of work went into this. But... it would have been better if it was about 80-100 pages shorter. Not because I prefer short books (the longer the better if it's great), but because 1) the author seems to keep making the same points over and over, and 2) it seems there's not a source he found that he's not going to quote from. These two things feed off each other until the book bogs down in repetition and runs out of steam about 2/3 the way through--I kept thinking, ""Wait a minute, didn't the author already make this point in a previous chapter?"" I had to push myself through the last third of the book until the last chapter (Epilogue), which finished nicely."
5,An aromatic feast,"I loved this book. Jack Turner's prose style is irresistible, and his subject endlessly fascinating: the central place occupied by spices, not just in the diet, but in many of the great set-pieces of European history. I have never read a book that caused me to rush to the kitchen, empty out the pepper grinder and figure out which peppercorns are real, and which are fakes introduced for color. (You can taste the difference.) Nor was I aware of the persistently strong associations between spices and corpses - extending far beyond fankincense and myrrh - or some of the more hilarious sources of erotic stimulation that evidently inspired spice-consumers in many cultures and eras. A brilliant debut, and a hugely satisfying read."
3,"Well Researched, but not very readable.","This book was not what I thought it would be. I have read a lot of food history books, and I enjoy it when the authors include information about the plant itself- what it is botanically, how it grows, the process of harvesting. But this book lacked that. It was mostly a history of 16th and 17th century Europe. Dont get me wrong, it was well researched, but it wasent what I was looking for. I frequently found myself bored."
4,All about conspicuous consumption......,"I highly recommend this book for any foodies who are into the Big Picture. Why *should* spices have been such a big deal that people were willing to spend huge sums of money and/or years of their lives to attain them? This book attempts to answer this question along social, spiritual, and culinary dimensions. Some of what you learn may be surprising - Cloves came, originally, from one place on Earth and had somehow managed to be imported from a tiny Pacific island to Mesopotamia over 3,000 years ago! Some of the arguments seem kind of hand-wavy however - while the argument is made repeatedly that spices were the scent of heaven, the ""why"" never really comes across clearly. Nevertheless, the book is an excellent read and *spicy* food for thought."
2,That's a wrap...,"The first one had me pounding carpet in the theater from their inspired set ups. The second one had some good stuff as well. The third time is not a charm. There is little inspiration, like renting a car, taking it to a demo derby, and returning it in the first one. Time to move on boys."
3,"Sound is good, controls are a little flakey.","Speakers sound and look great. Not sure if it's just my set, but the Volume + and - buttons don't always work when pressed. They take a little coaxing to respond."
4,JBL Spyro 2.1 Speaker System,"Very nice product, easy to setup, and stylish. Some complaints about adjusting volume are valid but with persistence and holding tightly, the adjustment works fine. Highly recommended, nice looks, great sound."
4,Nice speakers but very fragile,"I bought those speakers only because of the design. They are cute and original, no questions, but the flowery satellites have a vey annoying habits to fall face down, since they themselves are light and the cabels are thick.The volume control does work, though I was a bit worried about it, after I read the reviews. However, it is very annoying to use, since you can't feel if you managed to actually click the button and change the volume or not, until the change is really significant. So, for fine-tuning the volume settings, it's easier to use software controls.Anyway, the sound is decent, tha bases are even more prominent then I would normally like, so I pretty much turned them off. Overall, I'm not sorry about buying these speakers."
5,Amazing sound system for $60 bucks,"I picked this media system up for [...], before Christmas. I could not be happier with the set. I have been playing music off my laptop and iPod since receiving it. Great Base, great highs and lows. It's crazy how good they can make these two small speaks sound for such a low price. The volume buttons were kind of tricky at first, but it only took me about 1 min to learn how to hit them right, to adjust the volume. That was the only flaw, but a minor one. I am a dude and bought the black set....I really dont think they look that bad. I'm not displaying them for the world to see but they are really functional and out of the way. I love the wires that are attached to them, they are made of some sort of fabric but makes them much easier to handle...plus, they are really durable. Or at least feel that way. I would have been just as happy spending any amount under 100 for this, but not much more. Cheers"
5,JBL SPYRO 2.1 SPEAKER,I highly recommend this set of speakers. It produce great sound and small size that's perfect for computer use.
5,JBL - Spyro - 2.1 Speaker system (White),"These are great. I am very happy with them. They put out the sound like they were giant speakers, and they're cute too. I would buy these again in a heartbeat."
2,"Look cool, sound OK, but volume keys don't work at all","I bought these speakers because they looked so cool. Very innovative design. The sound is pretty good, but not great -- decent highs, but the bass from the subwoofer isn't as strong as I would like. Based purely on the design and sound, I would recommend these speakers to others.But I cannot recommend these speakers since they have a ""fatal flaw"". JBL really messed up when they made the volume buttons touch sensitive. Interesting concept, except that they don't work AT ALL. I can't raise or lower the volume, or mute the speakers. I'm stuck listening to everything at the default volume level. In reading some blogs, it turns out that others are experiencing the same problem that I am. Sounds like a fundamental design flaw in the product.I applaud JBL's effort to bring some style to the PC speaker market, but they went too far with the volume keys, putting form ahead of function."
4,Great sound quality,"I'm very happy with these speakers. I needed them so I could watch a DVD on my computer while I walk on the treadmill, and they needed to be loud enough to hear over the treadmill and my footsteps. Success!I only wish they had a remote so I could adjust the volume from a distance."
3,Good speakers,Great quality and very well designed speakers. The only problem that I find is using volume buttons that are hard to press. I end up using volume on my computer screen most of the time for any adjustments
2,Bad power supply,It is cute and the sound is OK. The power supply is a piece of junk and it stops funtioning after 2 uses.
4,Very Interesting... But Cute,"I only wish they had provided some type of clip to put the flower tweeters on my iMac. The bass unit is a little clunky (large) for my taste. But it sounds ok, at least better than my dying Logitech 3 way system did. The bass is really good, I can't leave the music playing all night the way I used to, it travels all through the house, even at low volume.BTW, ""Fuchsia"" means ""Pink"", not purple, as my apparently poorly calibrated monitor led me to believe... :) In fact, I'm looking at the image right now and that color is not even close to what came out of the box. Think ""bright pink"".NOTE: To work the volume level from the speaker, you must place a finger on BOTH sides of the flower, as per the instruction booklet, which some of you obviously didn't read. Peace and love."
2,"Tinny sound, volume buttons don't work","I love the compact speakers, but the sound is...pretty bad, frankly. Music sounds disappointingly tinny. The volume buttons don't work at all.And while the design is very cool, it's also impractical: the power button is on the back of the subwoofer, between the cable jacks. Who thought that was a good idea?"
4,"Excellent for the price, but with kink","I just bought these at Sam's Club for $40 (in white to match my mac)! I went online to read the reviews. I bought them because i saw they were on sale and for the price, they were exactly what I needed. They have great sound and amazing volume for the size of the speakers. I can't complain about the subwoofer since it's perfect for my needs. However, my only complaint is the positioning of the input jacks and bass control. with all the wires where they are supposed to go, it is very difficult to adjust the bass. Also, the way it's set up, the control is right next the rest of the jacks in the BACK... or the jacks are in the FRONT depending on how you look at it. All in all... not a bad buy for $40, but I'm glad I didn't pay Amazon's price."
1,it doesn't work anymore,"I do not use them to much, just the normal. 6 months after i had purchased, it stopped working"
3,for under $60 can't complain,"For under $60 (remanufactured) you get your money's worth. Asw other reviewers have attested to, the volume 'button' is not very easy to use. My advise, press down hard on the plus or minus button and eventually it will increase or lower the volume."
2,Green Mile,The movie was great and the score enhanced it but I ordered the CD because of there were 3 or 4 old songs that sounded good. Thats it! The rest of the 20 tracks are useless out of the movie context. Save your money.
2,The green mile,I felt frustrated with this CD. I saw the movie and I listened so beautiful Jazz Music . The CD just has a few ones. The rest ...is forgettable
2,Somewhat Dark,"I found this CD to have very dark-natured music, not very enjoyable for the most part as the individual tracks changed so often that the feel of the CD is not very cohesive."
5,Nice wheel cover,"Nice wheel cover! Expensive looking and fits well. Feels good on your hands, great grip for turns. Good buy, GO PATS!"
3,Beware,This is the same book with different characters that he previously published called Cast in Stone. Don't order both!You will be disappointed to learn that you are reading the same book twice.
5,Twists...twists...twists,First G.M. Ford book I've read. Very entertaining with likable characters. Dialoge reveals quite a sense of humor. Starts out a bit slow but going to the end is worth the trip.
4,Still a Fan,"I have all of the Leo Waterman and Frank Corso books. Was Blind Eye one of the best? Doesn't even come close to Black River, but I don't regret having made the purchase and would still recommend. No, it wasn't always believable (hey, it's fiction), but the trip across country and the weaving in of past events kept me interested. Frank and Meg once again make it out alive which for me made up for the rather creepy ending."
3,Decently crafted but on the whole a downer,"I've read every one of G.M Ford's books. This book covers similar territory to his second book ""Cast in Stone"". ""A Blind Eye"" is more tightly plotted and moves faster than CIS but it feels less inventive to me. There's some ok dialogue and some interesting material on isolated hill communities in the eastern US but there's some incredibly weak dialogue as well, e.g. the banter between Corso and his ex-lover Dougherty at the beginning. After three books, the Frank Corso character just doesn't interest me that much. My response to the grim subject matter tells me that it is time to read more uplifting stuff. Addicts to the genre will be not be too disappointed but for me it's really time to move on, i.e. I'll probably read the next book. Go figure."
4,Great Book!!!,This book was a page turner. I was really enjoyed Tasha Brown storyline. It was good to see a girl with nothing pull herself up. Love Changes is a diamond in the rough. Five stars to the author.
3,Too big,"Unfortunately, this thing is bigger than you probably realize. It is about an inch wider than standard-size (17"") A/V equipment. I was hoping to put it on top of my receiver, but it looks silly there, hanging over the edges. It's also curved on the top, so you can't put anything on top of it. The lights on the front don't tell you anything useful. Overall, although the power protection specs are great, I regret buying this expensive toy."
5,Excellent memory,I first purchased PNY memory for my Thinkpad T40 laptop but it gave me problems after a week. I purchased this Kingston memory and have had no problems so far after 7 months.
4,Great hard case for the TZ5,I got this case for the TZ5 camera from Panasonic. Its great in size and does a good job in protecting the camera. There is enough space for an extra battery and a few memory cards in the case. Fits like a glove. Really recommended.
2,"nice case, but GIANT!","Make sure you look at all pictures posted to see how much bigger than necessary this case really is (don't rely on the description!! - for Panasonic TZ, LZ and LS). My old Lumix case fit like a glove and I could carry it anywhere. This one actually has three separate pockets inside. (for 3 different cameras???) Will have to buy a new case that fits better."
2,Uncomfortable,"It's uncomfortable to use, it's too large to use inside a purse and it's feel unsafety to hang on the jeans."
2,Bulky Case for Panasonic TZ5,I purchased the TZ5 in order to have a long zoom in a small package. Unfortunately the camera is too big to put in ones pocket (I do not where a coat in 90 degree weather). Thus I was looking for a case to hang off my belt. The only pictures I could find on line were of the front ... those pictures make the case look reasonably compact. It is not. It is fully twice the depth of the camera. My guess is the designer wanted to carry lunch in there with the camera. I have added some pictures of the camera and case to illustrate the relative size.Otherwise it is a very nice case ... but whats the point of a compact camera if the package winds up being the size of a super zoom ??
4,Lumix hard case,Nice case Kind of bulky which can't be helped due to the camera size. Would have been nice to have room for extra batteries.
4,"Nice, but a little too big","Good case, hard enough for the camera not to break while inside, even if it falls from your hand. However, it is a little too big to carry around in a coat pocket - I imagined it would be a bit smaller. Nice choice, though - I'm pretty happy with it."
5,Great Case,"The case is perfect size for my Panasonic TZ5. The camera is a bit old but still works great -- the camera takes better photo than iPhone. I dropped camera a few times but the case protects and camera works fine. It's great case and if you would like to keep camera long, the case would help to keep it longer. Highly recommended."
1,"Horrible, ugly, uncomfortable, poorly constructed","These were a big disappointment.a) they look very tacky (pix on amazon just don't give enough detail to have judged this prior to purchase) and poorly made. I felt like a female pimp wearing these garish shoes, yuck!b) they are not at all comfortable. The fit is very odd in that when not walking, it seems to be the right size i.e. in terms of where the toes fit in the shoe, heel etc. but when walking it seems to get loose in the back/heel area.c) the lining is hard and unyielding.Horrible shoes! If I could give less than 1 star I would. I would not purchase this or any other shoes from this company b/c the quality and fit just aren't up to par.Before I could even wear them, and was just (gently BTW) unzipping it, a tear happened just like that, so I'm not at all optimistic about how long these shoes are gonna last which is just as well since they suck anyway.I'm not a curmudgeon, u can check out my other reviews, it's just these bl**dy shoes."
5,These guys are too good not to be headlining arenas across t,The biggest crime in music is when you get a great band that most people never hear. This is one of them. TNT has been around for a very long time. And unlike most 80's band's they still sound great. Tony voice is even better then before (if that's possible). Ronni is still one of the best shredder's in the business. Diesel and Morty can still drive the bottom end as good as anyone. Buy this CD and start enjoying great music again. Loney Nights should have already been in the Top 10 and been overplayed on the radio. GREAT CD. Buy It!!!
3,Still Not As Good As Tell No Tales or Intuition,I bought this CD based on the reviews I read at Amazon and I listened to a few of the clips. The CD is just OK. I'd buy the single Everybody's Got a Secret and call it a day. The rest of the tracks sound like the Transistor CD meets whitenoise with some melody thrown in. There is NO DOUBT that Tony Harnell has a fantastic voice and that Ronnie LeTekro can shred on the guitar but the music (with the one exeception) just is not there. Tell No Tales is still the best CD they've ever made. Bring back the old TNT.
5,Fantastic!,"There has been a lot of good music released in 2004 by veteren hard rock acts, but TNT's latest, ""My Religion"", is simply the best! This is the best music I've heard in years. Unlike a lot of bands making comebacks these days, TNT stays true to form with the music on this album. If you're reading this review, you've probably heard the music of TNT before, so you should have some idea of what to expect. ""My Religion"" is their best work yet, period. If you're a fan of catchy melodic hard rock, this CD is for you. You'll love it, guaranteed."
2,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"Just let this one die a slow painful death. What I expected was a return to 80's era kick ass metal...what I got was more candy arsed bubble gum training bras flying on stage Bullhockey. So, I actually do kinda like She Needs Me, but where the heck is Ronni Le Tekro? Even his playing on this is a disappointment to metal fans everywhere. So sad."
5,OH MY GOD! They've done it again!,JUST BUY IT! This is one of the best melodic rock albums ever. I wish that the world could understand and appreciate the wonder of this band and not look at them like a 80's band.
5,Soy realmente un lider?,"El Espejo del Lider es un excelente libro para todos aquellos que se consideran lideres pero han descuidado aspectos importantes en la vida que van mas alla del ""exito"" laboral.Con relatos simples nos recuerda el valor de las personas, la familia, la tolerancia y nos ayuda a descubrir lo positivo de cada individuo y cada circunstacia que se presente.Siempre regreso a este libro y descubro algo nuevo cada vez."
5,Terrific Book,Along with the author's other book on the competition models this is a terrific combination that represents original and unaltered early Jags. For Jag lovers interested in restoration or in documenting an early car this book would be very helpful.
2,"Not a Total Failure, But.....","Unfortunately I do not share in the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers. This record is the transition point between the classic Soft Machine and the humdrum new age Soft MAchine of the mid-late seventies. There are moments of brilliance but to compare this record to the likes of Third, Fourth or even Fifth is ludicrious at best. this is the beginning of a whole new band and a much different one at that. Without Wyatt and Ratledge taking a distinct backseat the entire feel of the record is ""safe"". With all the live issues out (from 69-72)and the the first 5 records also available theres no real reason to purchase this. My advice: avoid."
3,soft machine six ok but...,"There's enough good music to make one disk of quality, but instead they made a double of mixed music, some of which I could have made myself late on a Saturday night. 1983, by Hopper is terrible, I guess the writing was on the wall for him in neon. Chloe is excellent, as is the other Ratledge studio number. Ten minutes of the live half is worth listening to. If you don't this post-Wyatt period, buy As If... which contains Chloe, but then you'll miss Pigling Bland. It contains Kings and Queens to make up for this."
3,"Extremely talented, but limiting","3 1/2 starsAmazing instrumental prowess as expected, although the compositions are sub par for this bands standards..Often the uninspired psychadelic meanderings mire the meat and potatoes of this disc, which is not a whole lot when used to dealing with the insanely high standards of the band. Still, the spirit of Soft Machine remains intact enough to continue to enthrall at certain points of jamming bliss, although sadly of a lesser order."
3,Too dense for the non-linguist..,"Might be better for someone with a background in linguistics, or someone who at least has the jargon. Without either of those, there were many times when the text was too difficult for me to fully grasp."
2,Not as hot as the picture,"These shoes are quite unique, but don't look too classy in person. Perhaps in a size 6 they would be cute..."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I first purchased the expansion pack, Makin' Magic, and played with it for a day or so, and then I purchased this book on the expansion pack hoping for some tips and tricks and some more info on the game. Unfortunately, I didn't find what I was looking for. The book does have some good charts about what spells require which ingrediants and what it takes to do a spell right and takes you for an overview of the game, but there weren't any helpful tips except for one or two. And everything I read in there I had already figured out just by playing the game. There also aren't any cheats in this book like there are for the rest of the books (on the rest of the expansion packs). Overall, I found this to be a bit of a disappointment. If you are buying it with the game then I guess it'd be alright, but if you already bought the game and played around with it for a few hours then you know all this book can tell you."
5,"The Sims ""Makin Magic"" Guide","I have purchased items from this seller before and am never let down. The book was in mint condition, shipping was speedy, and packaging was great!"
1,Didn't buy the book . . . YET,"In my opinion, I don't know wether to get because it is usefull, or not to get it because it isn't usefull. I have been dying to get the Sims Makin Magic since the time my friend told me about it. I own every Sims Expansion pack that there is. The original Sims, The Sims Livin Large, The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Unleashed, and The Sims Superstar. I was actually VERY disappointed in the Sims Superstar, but that's what I get for getting it just to spend my hard earned money. I thought that the book would be usefull, but when I heard that there are 240 pages and only 111 are devoted to The Sims Makin Magic, I was kinda bumed. Somebody, PLEASE help me make the write decision! (I only filled in the star because I had to, don't take my word based on the stars, do it based on my most likely unhelpful review because I haven't bought the book yet!)"
1,Where's the escape route?,"Stefani hit gold and platinum with Love.Angel.Music.Baby, which was a charming confection of retro-pop with a splash of modern clubbing. The biggest hit however was 'Hollaback Girl', a Neptunes-produced, hip-hop inspired jam.Apparently Stefani thought it would be prudent to put out another album basically full of 'Hollaback Girls'. What a mistake. 'The Sweet Escape' is an almost endless nightmare of misplaced hip hop and Stefani posturing like a rapper. What made ""LAMB"" so charming is totally absent on an album full of derivitive beats and 'featuring' rappers. Stefani is not a rapper nor should she pretend to be one; she only comes off as incredibly commercial, fake and ultimately a huge let down as this album sounds exactly like all other Top 40 music in 2006, instead of being different and quirky like her previous album.So much for being the next Madonna. What a shame, what a disappointment Stefani turned out to be."
4,Very different from No Doubt,"HOT.....Just HOT. Especially Breakin' Up, Don't Get It Twisted, and Wind It Up. This and last her album are huge departures from her alternative/Ska style with No Doubt--which is equally great. Maybe she should do this style in one album and then her old roots in another.I keep getting the early 80's Blondie vibe in the album cover...."
1,Its easily a bad album.,"This album is further proof she needs to either return to no doubt and only no doubt or just quit....its really a horrid album and I bet she knows it, thank god I didnt pay for it."
1,Time To Take A LONG Break,"Long time fan but Miss Stefani takes these scraps from Love Angel Music Baby sessions and becomes a self parody. Like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper et al her cartoon persona and run away slave to fashion status have become greater than her musical output. It's interesting that the record company is promoting this recording like it's new material and accompanying it's release with a tour -- when in fact this B rate materail would have been better served as a L.A.M.B. extras disc. Sad to see artists get consumed with their own hype. This is a low point in her career. And how old is this woman anyway???"
2,I really really wanted to like it....,"I was very excited about getting this CD. I wanted to like it so bad but it just does not sound good to me. I listened to it again and again hoping that the third, fourth, maybe fifth time would be the charm. A couple of the songs have good beats but bad lyrics and vice versa. I gave 2 stars in instead of 1 because I do respect that she at least tried something different in trying to keep up with the ever changing trend in music, it just didn't work."
2,Disappointed,"As a long time No Doubt and Gwen Stafani fan, I have to say I was disappointed at the end of this album. The fire, the excitment, the desire to move to music were all gone. The first track, Wind It Up, is pretty much the only track I'll likely listen to on a regular basis.What has made Gwen impressive in the past has been her individuality, her ability to march to her own drum. I couldn't help thinking the whole time I was listening that this sounds like everyone else. I wasn't expecting to hear No Doubt, I wasn't even expecting to hear another LAMB, but I was expecting to hear something different, and it just wasn't there.And most of all, I'm disappointed that the inventful, crazy, and classy Ms. Stefani I've grown to love over the years has missed the boat on this one."
2,and that's me being nice.,"This album. just.....sucks. compared to her first disc. it just doesn't compare.she sounds silly in most places. and i actually find orange county girl to be boring and annoying.wind it up is awkward.the title track has a very strange vocal part from Akon. an artist whose music happens to be plaguing the radio right now so,...i really don't like it.however. i really like yummy. also don't get it twisted and now thAT you got it. BUT THAT'S IT.i bought it the day it came out so...it got it at target for 10$ and i would not have spent more.gwen stefani is not a r&b; girl...nor a rapper. she should know this. someone...should tell her.early winter has a nice sound and vibe but it doesn't catch me.breaking up is stupid.and i never gave wonderful life more than one half-listen.if you really want Gwen Stefani at her best. get her first disc.avoid this one."
4,Half are good songs,"I like to wait to review until I have listened to all the songs quite a few times - so here it goes. My favorites are Sweet Escape, Early Winter (a slow song), Yummy (a fun song), Don't Get it Twisted (great beat), and Wonderful Life. I really don't like Orange County Girl, U Started It, and Wind It Up. I think Wind It Up was a really weak choice for a single.Some of the songs drive me crazy because they lack melody or chorus or....there's just something missing. They only consist of horribly childish lyrics put over a strange beat. But some of the other songs are really pretty good, so I don't regret the purchase. If you like Wind It Up...you will probably love the whole album. If you hate Wind It Up...you will probably like half or none of the album.Best Bets:Sweet EscapeEarly WinterDon't Get It TwistedYummyWonderful Life"
3,Some good; some bad,"It doesn't stand up to the test of time. I like ""Yummy"" ""4 in the morning"" and ""Wind it Up."" The rest is pretty much trash."
2,Disappointing.,"The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is because I like ""Wind It Up"" and because there are ""singers"" like Hilary Duff out there.This is the first time I've disappointed by any album put out by Gwen/No Doubt. Normally I check out a CD before I buy it but Gwen has become one of the few artists where I'd just pick up the CD blindly. I am regretting it this time.From the first time I looked at this CD I got the feeling it had been quickly slapped together, right down to the photos which are all the same (what's with that wig?).""Breakin' Up"" is actually a song that I'm embarrassed to hear. It's that bad. I don't think the lyrics are clever at all. In fact, the vocal rhythms are often imprecise in this CD, and at times it sounds like the drum track is behind, and needs to be tweaked a bit.Well, I'm going to continue to give this a chance; I normally love Gwen through and through."
1,Just Awful,"This must be what happens when a pop star starts believing that everything that comes out of their mouth is good. She's high on something -- ego or chemicals -- and probably utters things like, ""I am music."" This album is complete garbage."
3,Kind of a deception,"Gwen Stefani's second solo album was not as good as a lot of people like myself thought it would be. Some of the songs in here doesn't even make sence and she uses anything stupid to make a song like in Breakin' Up. Some of the songs in this album were written for L.A.M.B but they weren't choosen, no wonder this album is not so good. The only songs that are good but not great are: Wind it up, The Sweet Escape, Early Winter and 4 in the Morning the rest are mediocre. If you like Gwen Stefani or some of the new singles give it a try but don't expect a lot from this album."
2,Dull and Disappointing,"After completely going mental for L.A.M.B. and loving almost every single track, perhaps my expectations were a little too high for the follow-up. But I really just have to say Gwen's follow up disappoints completely!!! The songs are un-melodic, un-interesting, and just plain BAD!!! It's hip-hop meets Lite-FM! ""Wind it Up"" is the best song on the album, which isn't saying much. The Neptunes clearly phoned this one in. Maybe this project was rushed a little bit.It's sad when Fergie out-Gwens Gwen!!"
1,Gwennie,"I love Gwen but I love Gwen with No Doubt and I can't wait for them to get back together. I hate her solo albums. The only songs I like are 4 in the morning, and don't get it twisted."
1,Please go bacl to No Doubt,"Being a musician myself and an early No Doubter- I thought I would see what Gwen was up to lately, so I purchased this CD.....what a heartbreak & disappointmentThis CD represents what happens to a talented musician and song writer, it shows what fame can do to a once a unique lead singer in a great band, that now seems to be abandoned, to a breast implanted million dollar Bim Bo, Maddona wanta be? Who the hell is the idiot she is taken advice from.....This has to be the worst piece of crap I think I ever have heard come from the industry and I have heard a lot of crap, so bad that I actually Frisbeed the cd out my car window in absolute discuss.Gwen GO BACK TO NO DOUBT !! PLEASE - STOP MAKING SUCH A FOOL OF YOURSELF!I USED TO LOVE YOU !! - the way you were"
2,She needs to reinvent herself again,"Gwen has talent, but she's not showing it anymore. Maybe she does only have once face, but I would like to see her gain a new inspiration. She's not a singer, let's establish that right now. But she is an artist, and a very creative one when she's inspired. But this album is not all that impressive. She can make great music when the chips are stacked in her favor, but seems to be running out of luck now..."
3,"Sweet Escape is good, the others not so good...","I have listened to many albums from artists that have managed to come up with a single hit with other songs included as filler. Unfortunately, This album falls exactly into this category.The hit song on the album - ""The Sweet Escape"" is far and away one of the best and one of the most popular songs according to the number of downloads for it. Unfortunately, the other songs on the album are not even close to this masterpiece. I think Gwen Stefani is very talented, but she should work with very talented song writers (like A. Thiam and G. Tuinfort - the other authors of Sweet Escape). I give 5+ stars for the Sweet Escape and maybe a generous 2 stars for the other songs..."
2,Rushed Product,"I bought this CD without listening to a single song first because I loved the last one so much. Boy was I dissapointed! Aside from a catchy opening track the rest of the CD left me bored. Don't get me wrong, this isn't bad CD, its just not a good one. Nothing overtly original, to me it sound likes songs that were rejected from the pussycat dolls CD. I dont know what happened between this new CD and the last one, but I think Gwen needs to go back to those old producers, or just take more time making a great album instead of rushing one out.Just my opinion"
1,"I'm one of Gwen's L.A.M.Bs but Need a ""Sweet Escape"" from Her New Album","I am a HUGE Gwen Stefani fan. I loved song after song on ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby."" In fact, I listen to that whole CD without ever skipping through any tracks because they are all so good. Therefore, I couldn't wait for her new album to come out. However, L.A.M.B. was a tough act to follow, and she just couldn't pull it off.I really want to find something to LOVE -- even like -- about this album because I adore Gwen Stefani. I admire her style and the passion she has for everything she does whether it's singing or designing clothes. ""Orange County Girl"", a song I first heard at one of her concerts over a year ago is OK, but nothing spectacular. It's a far cry from ""Rich Girl"", or ""Harajuku Girls"" or ""Hollaback Girl"" -- although nothing will ever compare to that one!I wish I could lie and say ""The Sweet Escape"" is good, but unfortunately, it just isn't. It really pains me to give Gwen 1 star, but I'm afraid I have to."
2,Not Worth Buying for Just 2 Songs,"The Good:Sweet Escape: Catchy and cuteEarly Winter: prettyOkay:Wonderful Life: bearable lyricsFlorescent: kind of cuteDon't Get it Twisted: chorus is good, every thing else is BADOrange County Girl: beat is goodTerrible:Everything ElseWind it Up: a terrible excuse to use The Sound of Music in a SongBreakin Up: Who writes a song about cell phone reception (besides the Backstreet Boys who could barely pull it off)U Started It: spelling You as U is not cool anymoreCandyland: not worth listening toNow That You Got It: good beat, bad lyricsYummy: useless4 In the Morning: boringThe problem with this album is that she whipped it up so fast. It's good beats with terrible lyrics that don't make sense or are just plain stupid. I love Gwen, but I am so thankful that the next record she is putting out is going to be one with No Doubt. You won't miss out if you don't hear this CD...it's bad"
4,It's Got a Good Beat and You Can Dance To It,"I did not think I would like this CD at all. My cousin, Diane, kept nagging me to buy it though. She swore by it, always telling me about how many dead presidents she would have stuffed in her garter when she would pole dance to Wind It Up at Benny's Buffalo Gal Show Bar & All Girl Review. I finally broke down and bought it and my cousin was right. As she would say, ""Dis CD be straight up stupid fresh wit' a quickness! Stick a frickin' crowbar in your wallet and buy it, yo!"""
4,Good Album,"I don't think that this Album is better than L.A.M.B, but I still think that it is good. I am a little disipointed that the songs don't sound like the 80's and 90's like L.A.M.B did. I think that guy named ROCKET or wutever who rote about this Ablum is STUPID!!!! With a capital S. Wonderful life is not the only good song on the Album! There si Early Winter, 4 in the morning, Yummy, Flourescent, and more! And what does that guy mean that Gwen lost all of her fans 21 and up? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard! My teacher (27) loves Gwen? so does my sister (25) my mom (43) and eaven our nabor (50)! I mean come on! All in All this is a great Album that you will love"
1,the sweet escape...of your cash and time,"Can we blame Gwen Stefani for the hideous musical ""careers"" of alarmingly-no-talent bubbleheads like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton?Did Lohan and Hilton say to themselves, ""I want to be a rock star. So what if I have some looks and absolutely no musical talent at all--I can't even sing! It works for Fergie and Gwen Stefani!""No, I can't blame Gwen for that. The deplorable state of the music business should shoulder most of the stink.I blame Gwen for her own vapid product."
2,Don't wind it up,"I can't even stand the hit songs from the CD wind it up, and sweet escape. I think Stefani's new album shows very little growth from her first solo album. I liked her first album, while very narcissistic I liked most of the songs.The best song on this album is 4am which is a GREAT song! I really liked it. Other than that there are a few 80's dance sounding songs on here that I like, similiar to her first album. Otherwise, it's a futilie attempt to attract 14 year olds, and lacks any depth or growth. I think you can be funky, and offbeat without lowering yourself to a musical lackey. I wish there were more funky, groovy songs like 4am. Definitely not worth buying the album. I love Gwen, and wish she would try a little harder to show us her talent."
1,Holy annoying,"When you see a video on MTV twice in a half hour, there is some serious over saturation of the market going on. What does that mean to you? Another insispid release from Gewn Stefani. The whole album's success is dependent on the single ""Wind it up"", otherwise why would we need to hear it twice in a half an hour? That song is terrible and on it's merit alone I would never buy this album. Having heard a burned copy, I decided to pass on this faux hip-pop train wreck. Lyrics have taken four steps back and sound like something Paris Hilton would pen and the music is only somewhat saved by the Neptunes and the track by Martin Gore. But even their music can't save this mind numbing trip into nowhere land..otherwise known as the the bargin bins for pop artists."
4,"good, but not as good as lamb","you can really feel throughout her entire first solo album how into it she was and how much care and effort was put into making it the best it could be. in the sweet escape, you feel some of that originality in the tracks, but for the most part- the sweet escape doesnt live up to Lamb.good standout tracks include: Yummy, wind it up, don't get it twisted, early winterthe second single off of the album will most likely be orange county girl, which in my opinion isnt all that good...cest la vie- im only giving it 4 stars because pharrell did a great job with beats on the album."
1,What Happened?!?!?,"I am so disappointed...this has to be the worst material she has ever put out. I love No Doubt and and really loved her first solo cd but this is just silly. ""Wind It Up"" is utterly ridiculous as is almost every song on this cd. I am such a big fan of hers and for this junk to come out has really made me doubt her as an artist. Gwen, You Need To Go Back To No Doubt Or Put Out A CD Worth Listening To!!!!!"
4,Gets better over time...,"I am a huge fan of both No Doubt and Gwen's solo work, but was unsure of this album upon my first listen. I decided to keep listening and the reeat plays were definitely worth it.My favorite tracks are Yummy, 4 In The Morning. Wind It Up and album's namesake The Sweet Escape."
4,Did It Again,"Gwen Stefani did it again, this album is amazing! Every song is differnt and unique. It does not sound like ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby"" at all or any of her other stuff. The Neptunes produced most of the songs so it has a great beat."
1,Worst album in history,"I wouldnt give this cd to my worst enemy. If you think about the worst cd you have ever heard, I promise this is worse. Please someone, stop the selling of this album.. I am afraid that if this gets in the hands of terroist we will all be doomed! I implore you, burn it... burn it..."
1,Let the mofo BURN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would not buy the album. However, you could burn it on the computer for free and skip Wind It Up since that's the worst song on the internet!!!"
1,You can go far if you have no talent.,"The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead."
3,Gwen rocks!,"The first time I listened to this album I thought it was awful! I hated wind it up and sweet escape woo-hoo was annoying and well I wanted my money back! But then I relistened at Now That You Got It became my favorite Gwen Stefani song of all! The thing about Sweet Escape that's different about her Love Angel Music Baby-is that SE is modern while LAMB has a retro feel, I like both and am glad Gwen did these two albums!"
3,"Very catchy, but only a few good songs!","It's an okay album, the songs are very catchy, but I can only stand to listen to 4-5 of them over an over again... it may be a better idea to buy MP3s of the songs you like."
1,?????,"skip through every single song and go straight to the last track, ""wonderful life"". it is the only great song on this cd. it doesn't sound like it even belongs on this album. the rest of the album is weak. very weak. i dont know what happened but i fnd it hard to beleive that this is the same talent that fronted no doubt and released an excellent solo album 2 years ago. i'm at a loss for words."
1,They wouldn't let me give it a zero,"Admittedly, I've never been a huge Gwen Stefani fan, but her music (and No Doubt's) was at least listenable. By that I mean I wouldn't automatically change the station if it came on the radio, but I've never been compelled to buy a CD. So, when she appeared on SNL last week, I thought, ""Well, I guess I can wait until the commercial break to go to the bathroom."" Mistake. Big mistake. I, too, am unable to explain my feelings about her performance of ""Wind It Up"" (and a quick listen to the album version didn't really clear things up for me). It's almost as if she and Fergie are playing some sort of crappy music poker, and Gwen has just upped the ante. The drums alone might have been kind of cool, but then she had to shriek throughout the entire song. It was an audio (and visual) trainwreck. They say having kids changes you, but it's not always for the better. When did music get to be so stupid?"
2,Gwen + No Doubt = Better,"I personally like Gwen's work better when she was with No Doubt. I am not much of a fan of her new work with the sing-rap, although creative, it doesnt allow her to showcase her vocal abilities.My favorite tracks:The Sweet EscapeDont Get It TwistedYummyp.s. is it just me or does orange county girl sound like a brooke hogan type track?"
2,Where's the singing?,"This album is the furthest departure from where Stefani began her ride to pop stardom. After spending some time with the album - I'm just wondering... where's the singing? If I would have wanted to buy some inane hip hop, two words together to a cheese beat, I would have bought the Fergie CD... If you're expecting her previous effort - you're in the wrong place. It sounds like Justin Timberlake and Gwen wrote and recorded their music together but in the end JT got slicker production.On a pass/fail - this album doesn't work for me. Anyone want to buy my copy?"
2,Big Disappointment,"Don't you hate it when you hear a great song on the radio or at a club so you take a gamble and buy the CD? That is what happened with me purchasing this one. The title track is very good and sure to put you in a good mood, with its classic pop sound. However, like many pop artists its one of only a few good songs on the CD. It is as though the producer decided to focus on one or two songs and the rest are just fillers. Besides the title track and a handful of others Gwen sounds like she is in 7th grade trying to cross the lines of trying to be cool and be a cheerleader. The music is stiff (for lack of better words) for the most part, and the yodel she incorporates is very irritating. However, if you like high school cheerleading and want to put it to music you may like it."
1,Bad bad bad to awful bad bad bad.,"Wow....what is this album.....the crappy leftovers from Love,Angel,Music,Baby?! I expected more from an artist with such amazing vision. L.A.M.B was so different, so new...this is just all bad. Still a huge fan of Gwen but I cannot waste my hard earned money on this album. Its just horrible. Better luck on the next one Gwen. May be its time for a No Doubt reunion?"
2,Very disappointing...,"I feel terrible for saying it but this is not Gwen's finest. I have been a fan of Gwen's since No Doubt came onto the mainstream scene. I absolutely loved every song on Love.Angel.Music.Baby. but there are only three tracks on this album that I care for. Early Winter and 4 in the Morning both have sweet, intelligible lyrics and Wonderful Life isn't bad. The rest of the songs on the album are kind of silly and not in a fun way. Maybe my expectations were too high following her last piece of work but this album just didn't work for me."
2,"Is the the kind of music that sets a good example? Remember the effects and influences,","I'm not sure what is happening to the music nowadays; it seems like instead of heading forward and better, it's going backwards and worser. Good music as a good example to people should have meaningful, positive and moral raising lyrics etc. I hate writting negative reviews but it's a concrete fact. Did I mention how music moulds minds? Let's think..."
4,don't listen to the haterz kk,"much better album than lamb, imo. More sythenic and current, more confident. She doesn't seem as nervous and unsure of herself on this one. Of course this isn't in the same league as her stuff with no doubt. Don't even bother if you want another return of saturn, but you should have learned that the first time around. This is supposed to be a fun, guilty pleasure.Of course it does come across as a bit calculating and jerky. It has plenty of variety. It's just fun, dumb pop music. Excellently done dumb pop music. And it sure beats Fergie."
3,"Good, but not the greatest","It really makes me sad to give Gwen 3 stars for this album but I feel this album was too rushed, I think if she actually spent a little more time on this album I think it could of been soo much better. I really hope she goes back to No Doubt I really miss them.Best Tracks:Wonderful Life - I really hope she makes this a singleYummy - most catchiest song"
1,This album stinks!,"Gwen's last album was fantastic but, this album really stinks! I have only listened to it once and that is one time too many. I don't think there is one good song on the entire album. The best thing about it is the cover art!"
1,what people do for money,wow.. i didn't know she raps? or yodel. did she sniff too much cocaine?i'm glad she loves japan..but putting the word HARAJYUKU all over the purse and call it your own brand? no originality what so ever. they look like a rip-off superlovers.
5,Another amazing cd...,"I just purchased this cd last night and I listened to it all day today. I couldn't get enough of it. Gwen is fantastic! She's like a fine wine... she just keeps getting better and better with time. Her last cd, Love, Angel, Music, Baby (LAMB) was awesome and this one is just as great, if not better. I love that her songs are always different. It keeps your interest and attention. The best! I highly recommend this : )"
3,WTF?,"I think some of these artists are trying sooo hard to do something different that it ends up sounding like sh**.The tracks 'Breakin' Up' and 'Orange County Girl'What in holy hell was Gwen thinking with those 2 songs?? Why would she even put that horrible garbage on her album? I didn't buy the cd( glad I didn't), but I've heard the album and only a few songs stood out, some other songs just make you go WTF?"
2,Not too sure,"Maybe I was expecting more songs like Sweet Escape, but I was a little disappointed with the rest of the music on this. This IS my first Gwen Stefani Album, so maybe I wasn't aware of the genre of music she does."
2,Average,"No Doubt, Gwen's old band, admittingly was a wonderful band that excelled to a degree that met the demands of people and their liking. Now that Gwen has released her solo albums, she isn't making the same music anymore..she really changed. If you've heard her first solo (LAMB) and enjoyed it, you'll probably like this album also. But for me, eclectic, bopsy genre music just isn't my thing. The only good songs on this album (to me) are Early Winter, 4 In The Morning, and Wonderful Life. The rest are just too immature, even though you'd guess a 13 year old like me would take this music and call it ""some of the best"". This album just doesn't touch all the areas required to be considered quality. Try No Doubt, because if you do, you won't be let down by Gwen if you're like me."
4,"Hated it the first time, now I can't stop listening to it.","It really, really grows on you. Wonderful Life, Yummy and 4 in the Morning make the entire album. I can't stop listening to it - it's great for the gym."
1,Wind It Up?,"Gwen Stefani has lost her mind. Wind it up is the most onboxious song I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Her first solo album was hit and miss with me. This one is all miss. I'm devastated. When we lost No Doubt, I thought we would be getting something better. I was wrong."
2,Weak Sophomore Effort,"This CD is a big disappointment. I really liked her last CD but this one falls short. It doesn't flow well and some songs have sounds that you would make if you were cooing a baby. She talks about liking to ride, but I wouldn't be caught dead ridin' to this CD. Less motherhood, more rock please."
2,I expect better from Gwen,"it's cute, catchy, but not what Gwen's capable of. I'd like to see more... just more."
3,Not as good as the last one,"I was a little disappointed with this album. She went wierd for her last one, which was fine because I liked it. I liked it a lot but this one it was like the same crap but not in a good way. I think after maybe the 6th song I just can't listen to the album anymore. So I basic like only 5 or 6 songs from the whole album. I think I expected more."
3,Dissapointed,"Daughter using the account again!I'm VERY dissapointed with her music. I agree, she will lose her fans under 21, because it's practically a remake of L.A.M.B. except, she has tried to 1 up it, when the songs went WAY down.Her only really good songs in my opinion are Wind it Up, The Sweet Escape, Early Winter, 4 in the Morning, and Yummy.I wouldn't waste your money buying the CD though."
3,she can do better...,"I was so psyched to get this album. I love all of Gwen's and No Doubt's music. But I have to say, this was not as good as I thought it would be. I only listen to 4 songs on the album. Most of the other ones sound very unfinished and like they just put some demo stuff on there. #1 is the biggest hit off it and #7 is pretty cool. Those are my favs. I'm such a fan I'm still glad I got it just so I could have those 4 songs."
1,Escape from The Sweet Escape,I am a big fan of Gwens work and her first solo album was great. But I must say this album is bad...real bad.The first time I listened I thought...I love her work...give it another chance.I tried a second time and quickly repackaged it and put it in the pile of CD's I never want to listen again.So..bottom line..if you live in a cave and never heard her first solo album...ignore this album and buy her first solo album.Members of No Doubt..it is time to regroup and save this great singer from any future disasters!
1,Weak.,"What a disappointment. I thought her last album was garbage, but this one takes the cake. The only song that I would press replay for is Yummy. The rest of her songs are wack."
1,And you though the first solo CD was bad...,"This might be the worst album of all time. ""Wind It Up"" may have surpassed ""Hollaback Girl"" as most annoying song of all time. At this point, it's hard to tell whether this music is all a joke or not. The only problem is that no one's laughing."
1,I long for the days of No Doubt,"Aside from ""Wind It Up"", this album, as much as it hurts me to say this, is horrible. I think what defines Gwen is her voice and in this album it is completely lost."
4,With a risk comes failure,"This entire album was a giant risk for Mrs. Rossdale. By some parts of this cd can easily be compared to Rock Steady, the parts that are the most challenging end up being the most satisfying. The first single on first listen is definetely offputting but after repeated listens it becomes a great first single. Yummy is amazing with The Neptunes production shining throughout. The most amazing thing about this album is how much Tony Kanal has grown since L.A.M.B. and it will be extremely interesting to see how this effects No Doubt when the inevitable reunion occurs. (2007-08, please?) For every four songs that she takes a risk and triumphs on there is one that doesn't succeed, that's what makes a true artist and I'm glad Gwen decided to shine for us once more."
1,Be Careful: this is a remix! Not the original!,This is some lame Akon remix. Thanks for not telling me that. How do I get my money back??
1,TCP Global poor choice of vendors,I ordered a Logan 350-1 matt cutter from TCP Global but received a 301-1 matt cutter. Completely different model.My paper invoice list the model 350-1 and I was charged for a Model 350-1 but was sent the model 301-1.I tried calling TCP Global on the phone but after listening to horrible music for 40 minutes I gave up.Looking at the TCP Global web site I find they are a Paint supply Vendor and their catalog doesn't even list a logan model 350-1 but does have the 301-1. I suppose they figure it is OK to substitue my request with what every they happen to have in stock.Now I'm trying to contact them via Amazon email to efect a return and will have to start over again. It makes me furious that any company would consider my needs to be so trivial that wasting my time this way is justified. Now I'm going to be 2 weeks behind in my work and have to order from another amazon (phantom) vendor.
4,"Great Pictures, Good Design","I got this more for the plan lists and photos than the design concepts therein.The photography is tops, and it really shows what a good plant selection could look like. the one thing that I wish it had (and other landscape design books) is the stages of planting. Like what it will look like the day it is planted, and what it will look like in a year or two. You get the full, mature version of the designs discussed, which one will only see in their own plantings after many years.The plant lists were very helpful in narrowing down the options I had for my space."
1,Very complex for Small Business,This software could be good if you are an experienced accountant. However I think it is very complex and hard to work with if you want it to be simple and fun to work with. Good luck in your selection.
4,Not Cropped,"I hated this film on first vewing because I was used to the John Garfield version and I felt the sex in this one was just too perverse, especially the scene immediately following the 'accident"". The movie has really grown on me since then, though, and it has become one of my favorite ""new"" film noirs. As for the DVD being in full screen: it is indeed in full screen, but it is not cropped. Instead, the transfer shows information on the top and bottom which would have been masked off in the theater. You can see that this is so by looking closely at the trailer included on the disc. You can get the same framing as the trailer if you have a newer TV with an adjustable picture ratio (16x9 +1)"
2,PAN & SCAN MARGINALIZES THE PRESENTATION,"Unfortunately, the image is cropped to full screen. Ironically, the trailer included on the disc is in 16X9!"
3,No letterbox option,"Believe it or not, this dvd is not in letterbox format. I was surprised and very disappointed. This is a great film, moodily photographed and features outstanding performances by Jack Nicolson and Jessica Lange. This was Lange's breakthrough performance and finally shed her ""King Kong"" image. It is still a great film but this one begs to be shown in letterbox format. Why did they bother with this dvd?"
2,Story Falls Short,"I saw this movie hoping to see a steamy love story involving Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. It fell short to me. While the performances from Nicholson and Lange are both good, I thought the story just didn't back them up. Basically Nicholson, a con, wanders into this gas station/resturant where Lange is working, he thinks she is hot so he hangs around. Her husband is the owner and a good provider, but he and Lange don't have much in common. She hooks up with Jack(who is now working for them), things start to go wrong, and they end up on the wrong side of the law. To it's credit the end of the picture did surprise me. Nicholson can put a picture on his back and carry it, but in this case there is just not enough going on for him to do it. The movie is painfully slow and the characters while well acted are really not very interesting. Two stars for the two stars."
2,The postman always rings twice review,"I did not like this movie. I only purchased it because it is on disneys list and I am trying to own every disney movie on dvd/blu-ray. Anyways, I did not like this movie. Cora dies after she tells Frank she's pregnant with his baby... They fall in love but Frank was paid to have an affair with her. Not my favorite movie... I doubt I'll ever watch this again. I am with the one review on here that their is too much hype. I am surprised that disney signed with this movie considering all the porn and what not in it"
3,It was a decent movie.,"I enjoyed the movie. I didn't think it was Nickelson's best movie, but it is worth watching."
2,What happened to letterbox?,"As much as I love this faithful version of James M. Cain's classic novel, this DVD is flawed and useless. Warner Brothers, who released the DVD, failed to include a letterbox side...What gives?Wasn't the whole point of creating DVD to make EVERYONE happy: the Pan And Scan People, as well as the Letterbox People?Wasn't it about choice?We've already seen what POSTMAN looks like Pan and Scan: LOUSY. The film was shot anamorphically(2.35:1 aspect ratio), so that means approximately 42% of the picture is still hiding inside your TV somewhere...POSTMAN hasn't ever been released in a letterbox format. So until it is, I wouldn't reccomend this DVD to anyone...... unless NOT seeing what the director intended is your bag... END"
1,Boycott This Pan-and-Scan Butchery!,"Had I known this was not widescreen I would never have bought it. I knew it was a flawed film, but I wanted to see the performances AND the artistry of cinematographer Sven Nykvist--which is ruined in this cropped version. Apparently the film has never been released on DVD in its original format. Also, for those who refer to the Lana Turner version as the ""original"" version, you should see the Italian film that preceded the others, called ""Ossessione"" by Luchino Visconti."
3,Mistake,"I meant to lrder the original which it fantastic. This less so, but it has Jack in it. Always a treat."
3,Much closer to the book,"This movie was much closer to the book than the original movie, which for me was a treat. Filled with torrid sex and self centered reckless abandon, the two main characters convey those in the book as they were meant to be. This fleshes out the story quite nicely and keeps it moving through the twists and turns in the plot. Though there were a couple of minor changes in the story, what surprised me, and really let me down was the very ending. Though viewers should pick up on the irony of the situation, it is really driven home in the book!"
3,on one equation,"I looked at equation (3.22) for other purpose (than countingcosmic ray particle collisions) and there seems to be a sign mistake in the first equation (integrated mass <25g/cm^2): asit is, the equation indicates that the mass increases as theair column gets smaller (or higher altitude).It seems to be a pretty colorful ""fitting formula"" and itcould have been more useful if the reference to M. Shibata canbe found in the reference list (p.264: paperback) which mayhave information on which ""data"" (most likely a combinationof measurements/modeling/computations) the formula originates from.I presume that the next volume will have improved.** the rating should be dismissed: I did not read through thebook and do not have a judgement. I chose the middle because I did not have choice not to choose. It will affect thearithmetic statistics and if it matters, it is an unfortunate result of the limited survey method that mandates a choice of rating."
1,Sneeky!!!!,"The 4 volume collection of Danielle Steel's As it read 4 volumes and I got 14 CD's and 2 are not there. I too did not read the senders commet's and 2 of the so called 4 pack volume are missing.... I am very upset, this was to be a Christmas gift......CC"
1,READ THE COMMENTS OF MERCHANT,"I neglected to read in the comment section where the merchant said they were not actually seliing THIS item. I got 14 disks all separate, not boxed. Very disappointed."
1,Complete rubbish,This game was overly simplistic with the effect that I was bored out of my wits within an hour of game play. The graphics are poor and the game lacks any intuition whatsoever. Very repetitve and boring.
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,This game is horrible. I saw it at Best Buy for $9.99 so I grabbed it thinking it would have depth like most of the Tycoon series. I was sadly mistaken.It has 1 dimension of things you can do and that is about it.Don't waste your money.
2,Under cooked tycoon game - save your money,"Unfortunately this game was not done cooking before it was shipped. Although it is barely playable they obviously had a lot more work to go. It is quite annoying when game companies give up on a title half way through and sell it anyway rather than give the programmers a few more months to finish the game. It seems to happen a lot with ""Value"" titles and in particular tycoon games which don't have the biggest audience to begin with. Save your money, Spring Break or Roller Coaster Tycoon (1 or 2, not 3)."
5,"Every athelete should read it, it's a great book about life.",This book is about life and the determination it takes to make it. It's funny yet it made me cry. It takes a boy from humble beginings to being on top of the world.
2,not that important a read,"Very mainstream and showing and underwritten by trends of self-hate that would make him a ""minority"" and ill-treated in what once would have been a country where he, or his great-grandkids could have survived and even thrived. A good view of the anti-WASP-wasp, the voice that has internalized the voice of the ""other"" who sees him from a self-interested view. A great work if read from that perspective, of what happened to the internal ""hardware"" of Germans, English, and Scots (the latter of which made up half the revolutionary war)---all only to try to find a living space where they could thrive, actually keep what they earned, and have kids, soemthing their birthrates indicate they cannot do today."
5,This inch worm is a great pull toy for the crib!,This worm wiggles and jiggles when you pull it. It's really cute. I had it in my son's crib from birth through present. He is now 1 and still plays with it.
5,LOVE IT,"I think I purchased this toy for me more than my daughter. It's a great toy and fun, but my daughter has not yet shown any interest in it. (My dog has though, hehe). FYI: My daugher is 4 months."
4,ThrowBack Voice & Beats,This album caught me off guard. I actually borrowed a copy from a friend of mine who purchased it. The album features beats that are refreshing. It has a full sound and makes you want to dance. The girl who is singing has a different sound...kinda raspy but nice. I would like to hear more from this group with more diverse beats and more singing from the girl. I will be ordering soon.
2,Buy the paper book,No where near the full 100 stories and its just not the same with out Georges own voice. Buy the paper copy and hear George in your mind.
3,Wrong cord,Either Norelco had the wrong cord published for my razor or the wrong one was sent to me. had to buy a new razor.
4,Michael Angelo is on his way....,"I know Michael Angelo. He's been rockin' the Michigan music scene for over 5 years now. I suspect that Angelo's great music and songwriting will make a dent on the music scene around the world. I would've given Renaissance Man a five star rating, but I know the best is yet to come from Michael."
5,Angelo takes Rock n' Roll back to its roots,"Michael Angelo has arrived. I took a chance with this album, and it paid off! Angelo's pensive lyrics and cool guitar licks are in a league all alone. I would compare his acoustic style to the likes of Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and Tom Petty."
2,Review of Kindle edition features (not of book content),"The book itself is fantastic---I'm just telling you what the Kindle edition does and doesn't have. It's fine for straight reading of the main text, but there are some serious shortcomings for any other use.Pros:-typeface is nicely rendered-all images are includedCons:-OCR is not perfect---seems to have had particular issues with italics and numbers---so text is not 100% searchable-does NOT have page numbers (just location numbers)-endnotes are NOT linked (and the notes are organized by chapter, so hunting for the right note #33 is a real pain)"
3,Not very sturdy,"This press made great burgers, but on about my 3rd use, the handle broke off and the plastic seam cracked and it had to be thrown out."
4,"Great, But.......","This is a great device, however, the handle is the single point of failure in this product. I've used mine for over 3 years and the handle finally broke. The concentric rings that the product leaves in the patty aid in keeping the patty flat during cooking. I love this item, I just whis the handle was a bit more robust."
5,again a very nice surprise,"I knew the song Vamos A Bailar from when I was in Italy, and I already had it on a compilation CD I bought there. It is a very poppy summer hit, but I didn't think their album would be worth while buying. Then came Viva El Amor, which is very much in the same style. Since I liked both songs I was considering buying the album. Some time ago I came across it in a used CD shop and couldn't not buy it. And I must say, it is an excellent CD that is much better than I expected.Their songs are very easy to listen to, without being too cheesy. Track 8 sounds very much like Rain from Madonna, and in fact I can easily imagine all the songs on a Madonna album (even though some of them would have been on one of the older albums).I'm sure I will be playing this CD very often!"
4,This is the 1st version of this album,"This is the original version of Television. They released another version in 2001 with extra 'unplugged' tracks (and an mpeg video in English of Vamos a Bailar). They also replaced Viva el Amor with a dance version (the version on this album is better IMHO, gets inet radio airplay and is what drew my family to them).Either version is worth getting and if you don't speak Italian or Spanish, well, guess what: IT DOESN'T MATTER! You get to enjoy the music of their voices without passing judgement on the lyrics (BTW, the English versions out there aren't the same as the Italian; they'll be a letdown).Now go and buy this CD before it's gone and you kick yourself for letting it get away."
1,Not Pure!,"I almost bought this item because it appeared to be pure, as it states in the ingredient section. However, upon checking the Vitamin Shoppe website, I found out that it is NOT! It also contains: gelatin and magnesium stearate (along with water, of course). If you are looking for a pure product, this is not it."
3,3 and a half stars seems fitting,"you know what? i'm almost okay with the fact that a LOT of these songs sound the same because i enjoy The Minor Times' sound so muc. it's loud, simple, and extremely pissed. pleanty of breakdowns, (though that's never been enough to get me excited if does give kids something to do at shows) and some really tight grooves.the production kind of crackles a bit, and is very reliant on the tickness of both the rifs and vocals. i would call this an improvement from their earlier work, especially in the vocal department. much less high pitched, and ultimately much more powerfull. this album is far from perfect but certainly worth checking out. gotta support the philly scene afterall, right?"
5,nice earrings,these are very nice earrings. they shipped fast and came with free shipping and a coupon. nice packaging.
3,Stone fell out,"cute but disappointed stone fell out. Hard to say a lot about the product they look good but when the stone fell out you can't fix it, or do you want to pay to have the stone replaced return it after it is worn."
3,Classic 50's Republic Cliffhanger,"Good Fifties Republic serial, typical sci fi plot for the era, decent acting, lots of action,Pretty cheesy by todays sci fi standards, but a good Saturday night B movie of the era.One of the better Republic cliffhanger serials, Martians trying to take over the world are foiled by the good guys,Edited into a movie length feature called Missile Monsters in the late Fifties.My only complaint is the DVD picture quality is really bad, about the same as a VHS tape dubbed onto DVD,Watchable, but not nearly as good as it should be.Four stars for the feature!One star for the DVD picture quality!"
3,Fun trip back in time,"Memories of the ""semi-disc"" had flitted through my memory for years before I finally tracked down a copy of this old Republic serial. It's an entertaining diversion for those who can put themselves in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. The DVD has almost no liner notes and the most basic on-screen menu, but the video and audio transfer was clear and sharp. Recommended for fans of Republic serials; others could probably find a more useful way to spend the time."
3,Never Fear iTunes is Here !,I noticed you can watch these on iTunes TV episodes ( 2-27-13 as I write this; things change on iTunes all the time ) and the episodes are Free. If you get a list page way down to like #40. There were 12 episodes. Video quality was pretty darn good. Short in length. I clicked on it thinking it was a preview and I wound up watching a whole episode before I knew it. Mandatory fight scene was better than Radar men.have fun.
4,Fun,"Fun Republic serial from 1950, 12 chapters. The quality of this DVD is actually quite good. The print, though not pristine, is of much better quality than expected. Although only contained on one DVD-R, this 167 minute release has few compression artifacts."
5,One of the first UFO from Mars feature!,"This serial is a fun look into early sci-fi. A Martian crash lands on earth and gets an inventor of special ray gun to help him in his efforts to take over the world. The Martian builds another flying disc and uses an active volcano as a hide-out.Can the dashing air patrolman, Kent, thwart this plot? Plenty of fights and cliffhanger endings to each chapter. You can see the cold war paranoia in this serial, as the Martian has a vague Russian sounding accent. All in all, fun for any collector of retro scifi."
5,Fun Early Sci-Fi!,"This serial has plenty of action as a Martian lands on Earth and uses the help of an industrialist to help take over. He stows his flying disc in an active volcano, of all places. This serial reflects the fears of the times that foreign powers would infiltrate to seek atomic secrets for world domination. After all the cold war had begun. But don't woory, the Martian never gets close to his nefarious plan as the hero, who has his own plane, thwarts the Martian and his henchmen at every turn, although their are a lot of close cliffhanger calls!"
5,An interesting book with some very cool women,"This book was assigned in a course on American political history, and I have to admit I didn't expect it to be so interesting--I mean, Kansas??!! Turns out Kansas was a pretty amazing place in the 1890s, and there were a lot of very strong, interesting women involved in politics for the first time. The book is often pretty funny, especially when it looks at how freaked out men were about women getting the vote. I've recommended it to a couple of friends as a book to read outside of class (although it helps to like history, like I do), and though they thought I was crazy at first, they really like it to. I'm now looking for more books like it. Maybe I should start a list!"
4,Excellent translation and,"The Vedic texts are so full of wisdom and profundity that they take a real time commitment to appreciate them. The full text of the Yoga Vasista is no different. That is why I appreciate this condensed version so much. The meaning and nuances are all there, yet it is written in an accessible style. Make no mistake, this condensed form will take time to read also (perhaps one verse per night before sleep), but it is so sublime and so easy to use."
5,At least a book contains all the Fischer's games!!!,"I think for such a great player ( or greatest ) as Fischer, his complete collection of games should be published. Unfortunately for the time being , no one had done this job. Fischer's "" my 60 memorable games"" covers only games up to 1967. Wade's book only a collection and with a few games annotated and also has been out of print. Soltis book only covers 100 games, so for the time being this is only choice. I hope in the future someone can do the job produce and annatate all the games of Bobby Fischer!!! But for the time being what we can do is to buy this book, and play through and help with a computer to appreciate Fischer's games!!!"
3,Cute but simple story,"This is a sweet story about a mother, Thea Lockhart, who is hiding from her past and trying to care for and protect her scarred little girl, Nikki. When a reporter is murdered in Thea's building Nikki maybe the only witness. Nikkihasn't spokensince shewitnessed her own father's death. Nowher life andher mother's life are at risk and John Gallagher, the detective in charge of the case wants to protect them. But, will Thea trust John and allow him to save them?I rated this three stars but it could be three and a half."
5,This book is awesome!,This book was so suspenseful I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the next two in this trilogy. I recommend this book to anyone who's in the mood for a good mystery.
3,Rita's Guide...,"She covers the resorts.. compares ammenities & price ranges.. She covers all the resort restaurants with in depth reviews, food availability, sample menu selections.. and much more...As if this couldn't get any better, it does! For all of you internet accessed folks there is a special code that unlocks a wonderful & magical place on the web where you can read other WDW visitors reviews for evan more recent information, trip reports and tips.. not to mention some handy savings..As a bonus,this year's edition includes the standard top-quality you expect from Rita but also a small section on Universal's Islands of Adventure, a fantastic park that recently opened near the Mouse. I felt like this was such a bonus.. like getting 2 guidebooks in one.."
3,disappointed,"i purchased this book because i had read her ""walt disney world for adults"" several years ago and found it to be very helpful. this book however had many of the same descriptions and ratings. don't get me wrong she rates ""everything"" .i was hoping for updated ratings on some of the hotels to see how they were aging. her web site that you get a password for could be more interesting and up to date. i must say after reading her older book, i was a bit disappointed in this one. i also purchased birnbaum's guide to walt disney world and birnbaums guide to walt disney world without kids. i must say the most informative book is the birnbaums guide to walt disney world without kids, it has lots of interesting facts the other's simply miss."
3,see attached note;,"I have not read the book, and don't know the author, but I was looking to buy a guide to Disney World and did wish to direct Amazon's attention to the reviews. I've been checking your site a long time and rarely have I seen such breathless raves without details; they just don't ""sound"" right. I don't know how you handle such things but all I conclude from about nine of the 11 reviews is that the author must have a lot of friends!"
2,Rita's Book not the best out there,"I have 4 Disney guides, Passporter, Birnbaums, Unofficial and Rita Aero's. Of the 4 her's was a great disappointment. It did not have the detailed information the other three had and was difficult to follow. I would not recommend this book to a friend."
5,The Sociological Imagination,"C. Wright Mills successfully presents a powerful view of what science and social science should be while effectively criticizing close-minded, bureacratic, and limited methodologies within fields. The book challenges us to do better, and to think outside of the box, and even the perspectives we share."
3,"Marilyn, not John Wayne","There seems to be some confusion here. There are apparently two movies called Hometown Story. One with Marilyn Monroe and one with John Wayne. This is the one with Marilyn.It was filmed early in her career and she only has a small role in it. She plays the secretary to a newspaper editor that is trying to take down what he thinks is a corrupt businessman. The story is a typical post-WWII melodrama and doesn't really have any hold any cinematic history other than casting Marilyn.A must-have for the true Marilyn fan (in DVD, which is rare in the first place), other more popular movies might be better for the casual fan.Another person to look for is Alan Hale Jr. as the veteran reporter. He played the Skipper on Gilligan's Island years later and is very young here.Overall, Marilyn fans and film buffs will enjoy, others may just find it boring."
3,Not extraordinary but entertaining.,"The 1951 film, Home Town Story, was never released commercially. This film was produced by General Motors with the intent to propagandize American industry. Home Town Story is about a secretary (Marilyn Monroe) to a politician who is convicted that Big Business is behind his election loss. Marilyn does not have a significant amount of screen time. Out of 61 minutes, Marilyn is only present in approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds. However, this film is not utterly nor completely horrible. Perhaps Home Town Story is not a great first impression of a Marilyn Monroe film, but for an avid fan it is not her worst work."
2,Regret Purchase,"I bought this movie because its one of the last few Monroe movies I have seen. I knew that she would not be the main star and her time on screen would be limited, but unlike some of the other small role movies that she's been in, this one was BORING! Marilyn has a few speaking parts, but the movie itself was blah."
4,Out of Date and You Will Love It,"From the '70s, but if you are expecting Haight-Ashbury, forget it. The style is completely London Mod, more decadent than decadent. Nonetheless, weird things happen in this plot that is shamelessly convoluted. Now you see things, now you don't. Now you are certain, now you aren't. Drug hallucinations meet trick rooms in a carnival meet technological marvels, like the most advanced 'microfilm' projector I have ever seen."
4,Lost Classic,"Mod Sci-fi film from the early 1970's. Director worked on the original ""Avengers"", shares some sets from ""The House that Jack Built"" episode. It was released in the US as ""The Last Days of Man on the Earth"" in 1973. It has been out of circulation since HBO bought up the Thorne-EMI catalog about 1987, and buried it. I have diligently searched for a copy for years, never found one. Just the thing for an early Sunday morning cable movie. What does Miss Brunner do with the bones ?"
4,Good Movie (if you havn't read the book),You could call me a Michael Moorcock fanatic. I own over 65 of his novels...Although this was a good movie. It strayed from the original work far too much. There where several parts of the book that where skipped or edited to the point of obscurity....One thing is for sure. Moorcock was not close at hand during the creation of the film.Perhaps broadcast and media limitations at the time prevented him from creating the image he wanted. Or perhaps he simply didn't read the book. I don't know...All in all the story is basically the same. And the movie is a fine piece if work. Especially for those of us who enjoy the 70's genre. But if your a Moorcock fanatic. Your going to be disappointed...
4,1970s Britain Re-imagined,"OK maybe it's style over substance but I still find this film more alluring than most of the visual fictions I can be bothered crossing the road for. Not being familiar with Michael Moorcock's stuff (but newly curious to correct this) there was little to be let down by and this excellent period piece, an all-too-rare British film from an era that hasn't (yet) left too much else we consumers can wander about in, is full of great hilarious/horrible/stupid post-Oil-Crisis-Swinging-Greater-London characters going through their brittle numbers in a greatly-accelerated time-frame.Jon Finch is ace, and looks The Business as JC. Fave scene (today): the freaky 'UK counter-culture ala T Rex' disco-cum-arcade. Maybe some acknowledgment to Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange' should have been made for the look and feel and implicit-but-unspoken London-centredness of the piece."
4,It is ok!,I read the book years ago and was curious about the movie.It is a good movie. I think the movie was too short. If they added another hour to the movie for plot and character development I think it would of been very good.I would only recommend it if you are a Michael Moorcock fan orjust like unique movie experiences.
2,Not as great as advertised ...,"difference is not perceptible in semi-urban areas where some lighting existsmaybe on a pitch dark road, the difference might be seen."
2,Not what was expected.,"I actually ordered two sets of these, one for each vehicle. Unfortunately, one of them wasn't the proper one for my Avalanche. I have seen no difference in the effectiveness or brightness whatsoever. I'm very dissappointed in the result"
4,Excellent OEM Replacement,I bought these for my wife's '07 Hyundai Sonata which had a burned out bulb. Definitely seemd a bit brighter than the stock bulbs after installing them. She ended up following me home from somewhere the other night and I could definitely notice the difference in brightness. Good purchase.
3,Just as good as a stock light bulb,"There is very little difference between this light bulb and the stock light bulb in my car. It advertises that it's 30% brighter than stock lights; I highly doubt that. It's slightly brighter in total darkness, but performs the same in real life conditions. Don't waste your money."
4,Better than OEM,I used Sylvania Silverstars for a number of years but could no longer stomach the price versus the short life. I find these are a great compromise and I use them in a Saab 9-3 and a Saturn Outlook. I have gotten good service life out of these and they are way better than standard halogen bulbs.
3,Average I guess,"I got these when my lights burnt out on my 09 jetta. Didnt see much of a difference from the ones in there before but might be a little brighter. It sure beats one light being out, and the price was really good."
3,"Provocative title , little substance","The book discusses with a great detail the turkish military campaign against Constantinople. Furthermore, the author provides a quasi- psychological profile of S. Mehemet. But the book does not provide a socio-political research of the events that have preceded the Fall of Constantinople and it doesn't discuss the aftermath of this major event. I have expected a clear discussion of the implications of the city's downfall; something similar toThe Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World OrderThe author attempt to create a balanced picture of the event is irrelevant, albeit the result of the turkish occupation of Constantinople, according to the book, is that they all ""lived happily ever after"", the attack of an army of 150,000-200,000 strong against the impoverished city that had a defense of 7000 strong had fatal consequences that affected not only the fate of Byzantines but also the fate of Europe."
4,"Fast Paced, Readable History","The Fall of Constantinople was a watershed mark in history and Roger Crowley does an excellent job in retelling the story. Accordingly,many past and modern versions of the fall of Constantinople are deeply intermingled with both myth and religious narrative; narratives that blend what actually happened with notions of perception and what they believe may have happened.According to the author, (in his notes about the sources), his aim in retelling the tale of Constantinople has been to construct out of the various conflicts of blame, agenda, and religion, a robust central version of events.He does an admirable job of presenting a very objective story as told from both victor and vanquished.This is an excellent book that is very readable and paints a very vivid word picture of the events, actions and actors.Dr. Terry Tucker, Adjunct Prof History"
4,The strategy of war in 1453,"I enjoyed this book, and learned from it as well. The description of the siege was excellent: sufficient detail to provide context, not so much detail that the tempo was lost.Some fascinating facts about fortifications and arms, as well as some of the people involved.While as the title suggests this was a holy war for Constantinople, and a clash between Islam and the West, it was also a battle for a strategic trading port and a significant cultural jewel.Alas, much of the latter was lost in pursuit of the former.Highly recommended to anyone who seeks more knowledge about both the city we now know as Istanbul and 15th century power struggles.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
4,A must read book,I highly recommend this for any body who has any interest in the entire 1500 yearconflict between the Islamic world and Christianity. This event -- the fall of Constantinople --marked the end of Christian history in the Eastern Mediterranian area at that time.
4,reads like a movie,"Over the years, I must have read several books about the fall of Constantinople. I found this one to be the clearest, and most exciting of all of them. In many places, it becomes apparent how the author has actually walked the walls of the fallen city, touched the cannons that shot at them, walked the streets and churches where these events took place. He is fair to both sides, neither pulling any punches nor needlessly villainizing. He also has delved deep into accounts of the battle, bringing out both the courage and the bloodiness of Medieval combat, as well as the importance of faith in understanding this clash of Islam and Christianity. This book is well worth a read, to understand both the history of Europe and the Middle East, conflicts between the East and West, and the conflicts that continue to shape our world today."
1,not suitable for this age group,the pictures are graphic and the text is VERY scary for kids who aren't really sure about the difference between reality and imagination. Our four year old got quite upset. He wasn't quite sure if these things were in 'our world or not'. We say definitely NOT PG-13!!!
5,Great Product,Very helpful in aiding my monthly PMS symptoms. I will be keeping this in my daily vitamin routine. Great Product.
2,naughty tired by Nature,typical Naughty By Nature Theme a couple of Catchy Songs&hopefully that will get them over the hump.well not this time.Production&Overall vibe is off&Missing that Key Element to me.now they are given Props for hanging in the Game&maintaining there trademark of Party Grooves but on this set things come up short.
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,i thought this was going to be awesome but i was wrong.I liked two songs.this wasnt naughty at all.do not get this at all.
2,Not what they used to be...,"I'm sorry to all you Naughty By Nature fans and as much as I [respect]them, this garbage has put them in a new low. No acting grimy like in Uptown Anthem or O.P.P., but you got them dancing in videos with the song Feels Good with 3LW, and on other songs trying to act hard with Lil Jon. There are a few good songs here like Rock and Roll with Method Man and Redman, which manages to somewhat keep this album alive (suprisingly giving this album 2 stars and not 1), and I'm feeling the song with Pink, but the other songs are just swings and misses. I miss the Naughty By Nature's: 19 Naughty 3 and their self titled album. Hopefully there next album (if there is one) will be better than this right here, because if they keep this up, and they maybe down to the point where they won't be able to come back."
2,Naughty Not 02,not a horrible cd. but its only got a few songs on it that are good. a lot of ok songs. and few not very good ones. The Best song is FAMILY TREE and its the last song. every other naughty CD atleast a 4 rating. but if your a fan and a collector pick it up otherwise pass on this one.
4,"Great DVD, but a little misleading...","I have NO idea how this DVD can be sold for such a low price, unless it is being underwritten by the LDS Church! The first half is typical tabernacle choir-- always good. The second half is actually the ""Christmas With the Vienna Boys Choir"" video which is available by itself on VHS for more than this DVD costs. This fact is NOT given on-line, leading one to think the DVD contains some sort of combined performance of the two groups. The Vienna portion is an excellent production-- showing the boys not only in their usual sailor suits, but also in their everyday clothes as they go about enjoying the Christmas traditions of Austria. Most of the singing is lip-sync (to their own recorded voices), but that does not detract from the very colorful and inspiring production. You will feel better about the future of humanity after watching and listening to these boys!"
5,Wonderful for the Holidays,It's a great DVD to listen to or watch. Wonderful to have it around for the Holidays and get into the Christmas spirit.
1,Terrible,"Not worth purchasing, terrible quality especially with the high quality of equipment the church as setup in the main auditorium"
3,Reason for Return,"This 1994 recording of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was not very well recorded. Had you listed the date of recording, I would not have ordered something this old."
5,Wonderful Christmas Concert,"This was taped in the Tabernacle in 1994 with Jerrold Ottley conducting and the Tabernacle organists. The video isn't up to today's standards but the sound is glorious -- vintage Tabernacle Choir and before the orchestra all but obliterated the organ. Anyone who remembers the choir from its glory days with Ottley when they were still singing in the Tabernacle will love this ""souvenir."" It's all about the music, not glitz and glam and choreography. Ordering more for gifts."
2,Not what I expected,It was really disappointing; neither the Mormon Tabernacle Choir part nor the Vienna Boys Choir part was really good; too much talking.
2,karaoke with melody line accidentally left in.,"Music on CD is accurate, almost letter perfect. The only thing they forgot to do was to leave out the first sung line of the song, then continue with a cheezy sounding, quasi-piano melody line going throughout the song. I feel when I purchase a Karaoke Track , I'm getting just that, Just a track. Anyone with some experience singing and playing will know when to come in and maintain the melody without assistance from some space sounding instrument."
3,Not bad,"The songs on the CD are slightly different than the actual songs, but not enough to make a huge diffrence. All-in-all, it's a great CD!"
1,B.S. comfort substitute for the real deal.,"Really the guys name should be spelled Philip Toshy O'Pseudo.Zen banalities dressed up as some kind of internal easy-steps makeover for aspirant players.Heres some better advice-Crawl;Toddle;Walk;Jog;Run;and Sprint if you want/can/need to.Yeah Philip-playing guitar follows the Life Pattern.Wonder if I can work that up into a book-hmmmmmm----,AVOID!!"
2,complete garbage,"this book is page after page of tired 'zen' cliches which have absolutely nothing to do with playing guitar and, hence, have no application in terms of helping one become a better guitar player. the author has no right to be calling it 'zen guitar', either - a more apt title would be, 'quick zen reference guide', or 'general zen musings' or something along those lines. i'd like to know what all the reviewers giving this book 4 and 5 stars are smoking... highly disappointing and definitely not recommended. luckily i only paid a buck for it. i'll be selling this back as soon as i get the chance or, if i can't (which i imagine would be the case), i'll give it to my 'new age' acquaintances..."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is fantastic!! I highly recommend it to all musicians, not just guitarists. I've just lent it to my drummer and he loves it. A great insight into the spiritual side of playing. I've already seen effects this book has had on myself and my playing. There's so much great information and fantastic quotes from players too. It's one of those books I'll now leave lying around and pick it up every now and again to read a few pages."
5,Will Change the Way you Play,"This book really will change the way you play, but only if you play 'follow the leader' for a moment. The author applies Zen practice to the study of the guitar. It is done so brilliantly that one might not even suspect that anything particularly special has happened. But, if one records a typical practice session before reading this and then records a practice session after reading this book, I'd bet a lot of money that the guitarist is more happy with the sound of the second recording. If you are a classically trained guitarist, this book will help you break out of your caged way of thinking. That said, if you've never practiced Zen meditation, or you haven't a clue what Zen is before (or after) you read this book, the effect will be less powerful. SeeZen Mind, Beginner's Mindfor a wonderful introduction to Soto Zen Buddhism"
5,"Not just for the guitar, but for life","Zen Guitar speaks to that part of you (if you are listening) that gets so little attention in the hectic day-to-day chatter of this world. While it so happens that I have been noodling around with guitar for the past couple of months and is the reason that I picked up the book in the first place, this book is not just for guitarists. The approach that Phillip Toshio Sudo advocates in his book for approaching the guitar is a metaphor for how to approach life. I whole heartedly reccommend it!"
4,"A philosophy book, not a music book","This is an interesting book, sort of a hybrid between Zen philosophy and the reasons one decides to learn to play an instrument. At times vague (maybe the author's intention), it urges the reader to determine his/her motivation and approach to playing. I feel the reader would have a better perspective progressing through this book if he/she had some basic knowledge of Zen philosophy. Without that, some concepts may come across as unnecessarily simple or off point. Overall, this is a very good work....it compels one to become more introspective and realize ideas such as motivation and personal reward."
3,pretty much for performers only,"I bought this book hoping it would add a spiritual dimension to my practice of zen, and my practice of the guitar. I don't believe it did much of either, primarily because I'm not a performer and this book is definitely geared toward performers. I found the treatment of zen to be somewhat diluted as well. I guess it was just not for me! However, it's a wonderful topic and I'd like to see the author give it another go, this time perhaps with the guitar hobbyist/wannabe (e.g., moi) in mind, and a more rigorous treatment of zen."
3,Amusing but rather pointless,"I can't think of a reason why this book was printed, except to attract the attention of Pooh fans such as myself to purchase a cute-looking but overall rather irrelevant book on Pooh's etiquette. It's one of those coffee-table books that looks nice and is fine to browse through, but will not really start any meaningful conversations. A Pooh fan will already be familiar with the quotes in the book, and I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the summaries of the quotes. Regardless, it is a cute little book but do not expect anything monumental, nor should you expect to change your etiquette upon reading this book."
1,Useless,"It had no music, just words, it was not what I thouight I was getting. I threw it away in tyhe trash."
1,No music inside this book.,"This book only has lyrics, and doesn't have a note of music anywhere inside, and as such, is completely useless."
1,No Music!,Warning: This hymnal only includes the text of the hymns and chants. Imagine my disappointment as I expected the music to be included!
3,Kindle edition only has text,"This hymnal is one of the best. However, the Kindle download only has the text. If you want the music notation, you need to get the book."
3,This item doesn't include Russ's book,"Just FYI, if you are looking for an electronic copy of Joanna Russ' classic book, keep looking - this isn't it. No offense to GMU; this 3-page document presumably has notes on teaching this excellent book in a college-level class and would be useful for any teacher interested in sexism in general, and specifically how women writers are systematically marginalized."
2,Achtung!,"Want to add another layer of complexity to your already complex web projects? Add Hack Management. This book will teach you to write hacks that are being overcome through valid techniques almost daily. True, some hacks are still necessary. Most are not - at least not an entire book's worth."
1,Códigos incompleto o inservibles,"Este libro apesta... trate de desarrollar los estilos según las instrucciones exactas del autor y, es imposible obtener los mismo resultados que él... simplemente no funcionan los estilos o no da las instrucciones de forma correcta, además el libro no incluye ningún CD con los ejemplos o alguna dirección web en donde uno pueda ver que está haciendo mal, simplemente refiere a otras páginas que no tienen nada que ver con él y los ejemplos resultan ser totalmente diferentes o imprácticos.NO COMPREN ESTE LIBRO... NO PIERDAN SU DINERO..."
5,Natural Match,I am so glad I found this product on Amazon. It has beendiscontinued by the manufacturer and I will be looking for more of iton here. GREAT PRICE also and super shipping.
3,Hmmm...think of Ezra Pound....,"Iggy Stone was a terrific jounalist,holding the powers that be feet to the fire,as it were.Howevere, his undying Stalinist sympathies and loyalities suggest a blind eye,which discolrs much of what he wrote, for me anyway. Whether or not he was a paid soviet agent[professor Cottrell dismisses this] or not,would we be as tolerant of his leanings if he were a Fascist? Think of Ezra Pound, his vitriolic and poisonous braodcasts,and hgow he has been tarnished.Or Lindbergh.To be preached to on moral responsibility from soemone who ignored the atrocities that were day to day life in the Soviet Union is bizzare,if not wilfully ignorant.We have a responsibility to satnd up for all victims, as Albert Camus said,not to be on the side of the exucutioners. Stone was not, despite all his acumen and style..."
3,On the payroll,"Anyone who has read Stone's account of the Korean War (as I did a few decades ago) cannot be surprised at what is implied--strongly implied--by the Venona transcripts, and that is that Stone was a mouthpiece for Comintern in the US. Everything he wrote in Hidden History is not just wrong, but despicable lies...and Soviet records confirm this. If Stone had been an independently-minded journalist with a different slant, there is no way he could have been so far off on the origins of the Korean War. The only explanation for his take on it was...surprise!...it was the view being promulgated by the Soviets/Chinese/North Koreans.To call this guy an independent journalist is like calling Rush Limbaugh a socialist. He was, if not a spy, an agent of communism. And if you missed the launches of NK missiles and their nuke test lately, you missed the fruits of Mr. Stone's labor."
1,I.F. Stone: Confirmed Communist Spy and Traitor to America,"The Venona decrypts of Soviet cable prove beyond any doubt that I.F. Stone was a paid Communist spy. If you don't believe me, read the decrypts yourself (do a search here on ""Venona""). He worked to spread propaganda in America for a brutal Soviet regime that killed tens of millions, and he was paid to do it. When he died, his family burned all his private papers to conceal the truth, but ultimately he was exposed by Venona in 1994.I read this book with morbid fascination at how the liberal media touted this guy as ""a Gibraltar of journalistic integrity"" and ""The most honest reporter in America"" even as he worked to destroy our country. It's sad that even today few people are aware of the truth about this evil man who hated our American democratic, free-market values but embraced the monstrous totalitarianism of the Soviets."
2,Good but not for me,"I really wanted to like this movie, I heard alot of great things about it and the trailers I have seen for it really made it look good. Going to warn you gorehounds ahead of time, there is no gore or death here, I wouldn't even really consider the movie a horror movie, maybe more suspense had there been a little more horror elements it could have suceeded (in my opinion). The Story is very well put together, a couple of times you see holes in the plot but other than that it keeps your attention and its a pretty fast paced movie that keeps your intrest. If your a fan of cheap scares and not into over the top horror than this is a great movie, I prefer the later."
3,Plenty Of Room In The Back...,"THE HEARSE is a rather slow-moving supernatural mystery w/ Trish Van Devere as the central character, Jane. She moves into her dead aunt's house, only to find herself plagued by a town full of snotty folks, a cranky lawyer (Joseph Cotton), and the title vehicle. While not the best horror movie I've ever seen, it's not altogether terrible. There are a couple of creepy moments, and an explosive finale! Worth a watch on a dull afternoon..."
3,The Hearse,"The hearse tries very hard to be a scary movie, but sometimes falls into the classic 1980's horror traps of camp and cheap scares. The story is somewhat formulaic, but still entertaining and not hard to follow. We see a young woman return to her ancestral home after a nervous breakdown and try to become part of the community. Everyone hates her and thinks she is a witch. Well, of course, lots of bad things happened in that house and it doesn't help any that she looks just like her great aunt who died about 30 years earlier. The acting is not bad with some glimpses of outright good acting. Not lots of special effects, mostly moodlighting and the like. Good for a semi-scary film."
3,"Good acting & mood, a bit anti-climactic","Trish Van Devere does a terrific job as the lead, and the supporting cast is uniformly convincing. The hearse itself is somewhat creepy, and the story is entertaining. Unfortunately, the climax is abrupt and a bit of a let-down. The film also suffers a bit from the ""tameness"" of many movies from this period. Ironically, today it would doubtless be more graphic and technically superior, but the acting and mood would likely suck. I recommend this as a ""suspense"" movie, but it's not really scary, just a little creepy."
4,When creepy was less complicated,"What a great flick to pop in on a Friday night and let the storm winds and rain outside your window take you back to a time when that chill down your spine was brought on more by your spooked imagination and less by big budget blood,gore and computer run of the mill.Popcorn,please.Large.Easy on the butter.Large Diet Coke."
2,Not too much mystery here....,"""The Hearse"" is a typical mysterious house film from the early 1980s. The woman, who has apparently been going through therapy, decides to take a break and move into her dead aunt's old house. A similar plot was found in ""The Nesting"" with Robin Groves. Anyway, the woman sets up shop in this creepy old house, that has supposedly been taken care of for 30 years by a cantankerous old lawyer. One scare after another (mild at that) keeps our heroine on the run...boy can she get into that red car FAST. Odd blend of satanic references and creepy music. Some of the scenes are laugh-out-loud funny....especially the first time she is smashed up in her car on the way to the house. Fun to have running in the background of a halloween party... No real violence or nudity, just a few strong words here and there...and then that rambling old herse...It's cheap, check it out."
4,Hearse Review,"I remember watching this movie back in the 80's with my sister. It will put a little scare in you especially if you live alone. Even today, there are still parts of this movie that we still remember and talk about. I was going to give it 3 stars but I figured if we can still remember certain scenes and still talk about the movie, it's worth the 4 stars. This movie will spook you."
