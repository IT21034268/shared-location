5,THE best Tate/Labianca murder documentary available,"As an avid follower of the Tate/Labianca murders cases since 1984, I can EASILY say this is the most detailed and entertaining documentary I've seen, and I've seen them all! Scott Michaels and company put together the most detailed and in depth background story to the Manson murders and presented in a superior fashion.I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the subject, both new followers and old ones that can't get enough. Extras also include interesting on location scenes from Linette Fromme's childhood home, etc.Seeing this made me want to take a trip to LA just to go on Scott's Dearly Departed Tours- Manson tour.No question, worth the money for this quality work....just wish there was more on the way from Scott Micheals on the subject."
2,Disappointing,"I have been fascinated by the Tate/LaBianca murders since reading ""Helter Skelter"" way back in the early 70's. I have read many other books and have other documentaries of the murders, and after reading the glowing reviews of this DVD, I SOOO anticipated watching it. Afterwards, I am greatly disappointed. I didn't learn anything new from the DVD. Actually, this is nothing more than a Hollywood tour guide--where we see the outside of a home or some other site, while the guide recites verbatim information from the book 'Helter Skelter'. And in regards to the sites we see, I find little interest in seeing where Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate lived while dating, or where Frykowski and Folger lived prior to moving to Cielo Drive, or the school Steven Parent attended, etc.Again, very disappointing."
1,baaaaaaaaad,"i bought this program about 3 months ago and haven't had a chance to work with it until now. the best thing i can say about the program is at least i've had 3 months to get over the 80 bucks i paid for it - i may as well have thrown the $$ out the window. the program is the MOST user UNfriendly program i've ever used, the documentation is essentially worthless, and the virtual instruments are so virtual they can't be found! i'm more than disappointed - i'm ticked off. i wouldn't even pay the reduced price for it today if someone paid me."
1,"Lacks details, especially the wheels","There are untreated seams everywhere over the body, and lack of detail on the wheels is really eyesore.... This is worse quality than those $13 diecast cars sold in Costco, yet they charge $35 here!!!"
1,Watch out for expired ink,I bought a cartridge from OCinkjet and the date to be used by was 8-2008. I wouldn't buy unless they communicate that you are getting fresh ink. Maybe people don't usually check. I check the expiration on things like milk and ink. Maybe they usually deal with slow people
5,"Good product, great price!",This ink cartridge worked just as good as any I've bought and at a good price.
5,Antología de Toña La Negra,"Este album de 2 CD es extraordinario, pues contiene grabaciones de la mejor época de Toña e incluye un tesoro: la pimera grabació de ""La Gloria Eres Tú"" canción que fue estrenada en disco por Toña, antes que José Antonio Méndez y muchos otros, la grabaran. Recomiendo este album a todos los amantes de la época de oro del bolero.Emilio B. ANDINO"
2,Someone should have proof-read the book thoroughly.,This book focusses more on the RF part of GSM and not enough on the rest of the switching system. Chapters dealing with switching and transmission are dotted with errors.Good points are the message sequence diagram.The book by Gunnar Heine is better reading.
5,One of the best books on GSM.,"It is through and complete. Covers not only radio access network but also switching network in good detail. There is not so much maths inside. Call flow diagrams are particularly good. Although it doesn't cover GPRS, this book could be a good reference on GSM communications technologies. Warmly recommended."
2,More shabby chic than elegant,"I bought this to go with my elegant shadow iris dish set that is very ""zen"" to me. this tea kettle is not elegant nor zen. It has thick and very bright violet plastic handle and spout cover and a lid with a bluegray thick ring making it look very cheesy to me. So if you like cheesy or shabby chic this is for you. If you are looking for that elegant peacful understated beauty this is an eye sore! I returned it! The colander has the same ugly blue ring around the foot of it. Just to let you know."
1,Not as advertised,"This is advertised as coming with separate metal lids, which no other warmers come with. When it came, it only had plastic. When I called the company, they said metal lids weren't available, and I got my money back. This does NOT come as pictured."
1,Lousy Customer Service,"I ordered this product for Christmas for my wife, she already had something similar so I wanted to return.We have not opened the box this unit comes in, but I did open the large box it was packed in and discarded that box.They will not accept my return as I cannot send it back in the original packing box.I feel this is a ridiculous policy.Be warned when you purchase from this company."
1,Pretty sure these reviews are fake...,"I am utterly, utterly perplexed. This is in no way a 5-star rated book, and I am pretty convinced most of these reviews are fake, and Amazon should definitely investigate it.I could not even finish this book - I'm about 23% of the way in, and I simply can't get into it. The editing is dreadful, and the writing style seems very simplistic. I believe it would be a good effort for an amateur writer, but it is not particularly professional.The characters are very one-dimensional and the scenes seem forced.This is the first review that I have actually taken the time to write - My reason for doing so is that I hate the idea of other people buying this book for the same reasons I did (the wonderful reviews!)."
5,Wonderful!,Poppies is an excellent read! I read the whole book in 2 days. I was totally taken away from my life and thrown into this awesome novel. Deena Thomson is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading more that she has to offer! Keep up the good work Deena.
5,Poppies,"Wow;this book amazed me. All the action kept me reading, and wanting more. The excitement never stoped. I loved how once one problem was solved another one started, i think thats what kept the book flowing."
5,Awesome shirt,This is a really nice shirt. It looks exactly like it did in the picture which was good. It was everything I hoped for. Thanks.
3,"Good product, but some problem.","I really like it , but the Wolverine design was not at the center of the shirt. Was to low and to the left. Maybe just in the one I bought."
5,Chistoso,Loca y comica...me rei bastante...la tuve que ver dos veces para verla bien porque a lo que reia perdia parte de la pelicula. En serio.
3,It fits.,"Bought this to replace intermediate parking brake cable on 2003 Tahoe. The alternate replacement that most manufacturers provide (including AC Delco) eliminates the threaded end. Apparently this can make loosening tension on equalizer difficult. Since this generation of GM trucks has parking brakes that are high maintenence a real pain.Hence I bought this cable. It retains the original, easy to work with design. I only gave 3 stars because the cable is so much thinner than OE. Only time will tell if it holds up."
5,Delicious!!,"This jerky is awesome. The flavor is fantastic, and the quality of the beef is top notch. It's hard to find beef jerky with no hormones and antibiotics without paying a bundle for it. This was definitely a good value. I can't wait to try the other flavors."
4,Delicious things happen to these slaves-AND there is a story.,"This was the first IDOL book I read and I loved it!Gorgeous slaves on this isolated island are treated like cattle. Herded into pens, branded, put on display and auctioned off.YUMMY! Pascal surrender his mundane life to his secret fantasy and follows the alluring Casper. He feels he is a good slave until Casper shows him the indignities he will suffer before he really submits.sadistic lust, loving romance, bdsm. D/sIf you want to follow these luscious men into degrading slavery and also a good story...this is for you! 'screaming with delight!' :)Couldn't wait to read the sequel To Serve Two Masters."
3,Smaller than appeared in picture,"I like these but they are much smaller than I thought. For the price, these are very pretty. I wear them to work often!"
4,great for the price!,"I really thought they would be bigger, but they are exellent. Never have fallen off like other types might. All things considered I would deffinately buy again"
3,A Shot in the Dark,"""My work is not representative of dreams but comes from the same place as dreams"" -- This is perhaps the best explanation of the work of photographer Diana Thorneycroft.Using a range of sometimes disturbing props and masks, and naked or semi-naked models, including herself, Thorneycroft creates images in the dark using a flashlight and long exposures. Bypassing the visual, rational world, the often nightmarish images created explore issues of sexuality and vulnerability on a subconscious level. As she puts it, ""The body speaks a language the mind doesn't.""Intriguing, but not everybody's cup of tea, which probably explains why this book is so expensive."
2,Tiny Pendent - Super Thin Chain - TERRIBLE BUY,"This items is tiny. Not even worth 40 dollars in my opinion. I bought it has a gift and had to return it. The chain is so fine, it looks like it would break if you touched it. The pendent is the size of a finger nail. Terrible buy."
3,very small,"This is a very pretty dainty cross, just much smaller than I thought it would be. It arrived safely in good condition, from a good vendor, thanks!"
4,Liked it,"Though I liked the product, Amazon should not force customers to write reviews that have to be at least a certain length. Too often one says the heck with it and doesn't complete the review. Poor requirement"
3,Good but Brief,"Like most of the National Geographic films I've seen, there are lots of nice stills, some good facts, but not much depth. PBS and Biography should be bought along with this film. They all focus on different things. If I had to choose one film though, it would be PBS. You get more info for your money, plus their dramatizations are entertaining."
5,zar,I have been a fan of Russian history even before Ivan the terrible. He was a case. While serftom was wrong. At the top of the sceme was life ever good. It amaze's me that with Peter the Great and Elizabeth then Catherine the Great. Scemeing and politics was something else. She truly carried Russia to its top.
2,"Comfortable, but...........","""Blindfold is functional & comfortable as advertised, but after using it for 3 weeks, a 1"" crack in the plastic developed from the nose bridge towards the brow. Proceed at your own risk."
2,May not be worth buying,"I've owned four Mindfold eye masks in the past 10 years. The design is wonderful. The mask is comfortable, stays on, and blocks all light. Unfortunately, the material used to make the mask has gone down dramatically. They switched to making the mask with a low quality plastic in the late 1990's. The plastic cracks easily and quickly, within a few days. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the plastic edges are sharp enough to cut yourself. The worst part is that Mindfold didn't always use cheap plastic. The first mask I bought in the mid 1990's used a plastic that took 3 years to crack. I wish they'd use high quality plastic again. Then it would be the best eye mask."
5,Amazing Cookware Set.,"I ordered this set for my mother as a New Year Present and got it in time. It truly is an amazing cookware with excellent quality, pans and pots are really heavy. With all the promotions and discounts I ended up paying $45 which is totally worthy...I have actually ordered a lot of items from farberware for holidays and feel absolutely pleased with it.Happy Holidays!!!"
4,Great set,"This is a great set. Everything you need to cook a wide variety of dishes and ideal for a small family or someone who lives alone but likes to entertain. I wouldn't buy this if I intended to cook for an army, but it's perfect for small dinner parties and fits in compact cabinets."
5,Great service!,Great service! This is an older book that I have been looking for for years! It's in great shape! Thanks!
4,Stikfas are fun.,"I recently bought a ""Dark Samurai"" set at a local science fiction convention and was surprised at how durable and pose able these figures are. This one (the Black Ops Army guy) had one piece break off when I accidentally put the Right leg on the left leg. all the other Stikfas toys I have haven't broke or anything.. so it may just be the green plastic that breaks easily... he came with a TON of army gear (Mini-gun, knife, rifle, bazooka, flame thrower, binoculars, helmet, radio..) I'd say if you play with stikfas and you need an arsenal for your little army.. this is the one to get."
1,Not worth it!!!,"To be honest, I added these simple earrings to my purchase in order to qualify for free shipping. I think I paid around $5-$10 for them. They are garbage!! The clasp immediately broke. They are so cheaply made I was just amazed. Still, they were less than the shipping cost for my order, so I still came out ahead--but if you are buying these for themselves.... DON'T!!!!"
1,Amazon ships expired grocery items,Be careful if you are buying grocery items from Amazon. They ignore expiration dates on packaging. The cookies were dry and stale and over one month expired when received. I guess they assume everything is like books and CDs with an unlimited shelf life.
5,Unbelievably great!,"This is one of my top five favorite series of all time, and would be #1 if not for Firefly. Paul Gross plays the the courtious mounty with an almost reserved abandon, and I really wish that he would do more work in the U.S. like his equally excellent co-star, Callum Keith Rennie.Though this is on the surface a fairly normal plot-driven show, centering on a mounty, Benton Fraser, who comes to Chicago on the trail of the man who killed his father, the rock-solid foundation of this show is the friendships that the constable can't help but make, and the chemistry between all of the characters, and, indeed, between all of the actors. I could watch this show forever!"
3,no subtitles,"Love the show, very happy it was released. Got it as a gift to a 'hard of hearing' friend. To my surprise and dissapointment, the series was not closed captioned/subtitled. Very unusual for a new release."
5,Great Quality!,"My husband and I always loved this show when it was on TV and were so pleased to see it here on DVD. The quality of the reproduction is excellent. It's like watching it for the first time, but without all the commercials (GREAT big plus!!)"
5,Love it,I bought it for my mom...she will love it for Yule. I was very happy at how fast it came in the mail.
4,Amazing show; terrible discs,"You can believe everything you read about the quality of the series. It's quirky, touching, and thoughtful, even downright whimsical at times.I was thrilled to find this box set, and profoundly disappointed by the quality of the video on the discs. It looks at points as if it was encoded on someone's home computer. You can even see VCR tracking errors once in a while, and the third season is visibly compressed.In light of these quality issues, I'd rate the discs as 4 stars even though the series is 5."
4,what a wonderful series,"my girlfriend and I have been talking for years that we wanted to see this series again. and now, finally we bought it in this great complete collection. it gives you all episodes of ""due south"" on 11 dvds for a very reasonable price."
5,Just Great!,"Watched it when I was a kid, so it's a great trip to the past. Never seen the original version but it's actually better than the dubbed one that run on German TV. Truly, the quality isn't so great as there are quite a lot of episodes on one disc - but it's ok to watch and there's really no reason to complain when you consider the price."
5,Great set but could be even nicer.,"Really enjoyed this Series (which I discovered only recently) and this collection contains all of the programs including the series finale and the pilot. The DVD's are set up so that you can only watch one video at a time.Collection would be even nicer if they included some DVD extras. I also have the Canadian version of Season 4 (second half of Season 3 for US) and it has commentary from Paul Gross for the series finale. Including that plus some ""behind the scenes"" or ""making of"" videos would make this set even nicer. But, this set gives you all of the videos in one case and the shows themselves make this DVD set worth it."
3,Damaged DVD,"I was very disappointed when I went to watch the pilot of this Due South collection and watched 5 minutes, then the DVD stopped playing because of a flaw in the DVD. I could start the DVD playing again about half way through the pilot, which really left one trying to put the plot and characters together."
4,Great show! Entertaining for the whole family!,This series is good old fashion fun for the family. Our Canadian Mounty is a great example of what a gentleman is suppose to be. Great story lines and you'll laugh and never get bored!
5,Due South : How I miss you!!,"Due South was a wonderful series that was funny, wry, and enjoyable. The characters were lovable, and who wouldn't love Fraser and Diefenbacher, Ray (both of them), conversations with the ghost of his father, and Leslie Nielsen. If you loved the show and also the music (Due South: Vol I & Vol 2), which was great and oftentimes haunting. Get to know some very quirky characters and have a good laugh and some tears."
1,"Great show, lousy quality","I love the show, but when I got my dvds 9 of the 11 were scratched. My dvd player would freeze and I'd have to turn it off and back on again to get it to work. I sent it back and received another, but these are scratched too. I've never seen this before, but it is without a doubt the manufacturer's fault."
1,Poor quality DVDs,"I wrote to the seller, Standing Ovation, on 3/10/11 explaining the problems I was having with the DVD set Due South. They have not responded to my email. This DVD set cost around $25 which would have been a bargain if they were all of good quality. Unfortunately, they are not."
3,European Christmas,I thought that this would have more information on Christmas in Germany so I was somewhat disappointed.
4,Not a travel book,Lovely table book with information about how Christmas is celebrated in Europe. Complete with recipes and pictures of family celebrations. Because it was by Rick Steves I was disappointed that there was not specific information on where to stay during the actual Christmas holiday.
1,"NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS FROM ""EMERALD BOOK MARKET""","We purchased the Rick Steves DVD referenced through Amazon as a direct purchase from the above seller. The DVD did not operate when used in three different players. The seller, which is supposedly located in Old Town, Florida appears to be either bogus or no longer in business. Their website was nonresponsive and they do not have a genuine address or telephone number. AVOID PURCHASING FROM THIS SELLER."
1,Great if the DVD would work,I have seen this on our public station and had to have it. The problem is the DVD I recieved would not work. I tried it on 3 different players. I am really upset as I had planned to use this for a children's Christmas party at school and now I can not. Even ordering another one at this point won't get it here on time and I am not going to pay extra shipping for a DVD I am not sure will work. What a dissapointment. Has no one else had this issue? I guess I should have just donated to my local PBS the several hundred dollars to ensure I got a copy that worked????
1,I was looking forward to seeing it.,"I surely bought ""Rick Steves' European Christmas,"" and I was looking forward to seeing it. And I finally received it. But when I put it into my computer, I found nothing came out, no visuals, no sound. I think this had already paid by my credit. I have bought many DVDc from foreign countries, but this is my first experience. My computer is Mac."
4,European Christmas,Does not talk about a lot of cities (one per country). The cities it does talk about hold a lot of information
4,Christmas Markets,I bought this book as a gift for friends who went to Europe at Christmas with me a few years ago. It was truly a look at memories we have of one of our very best trips ever and Rick Steves gives a very complete review of how wonderful Christmas is in Europe.
4,"Added to my ""Must Watch"" Christmas DVD's collection","I watched this special on PBS several times but wanted my own copy to add to my Christmas DVD's that I like to watch anytime on my own during this season. I really enjoyed the European Christmas traditions as I have lived in Europe for several years and enjoy other cultures.The downside to my DVD was one of the choir performances, from Norway, would not play and I had to skip to the following one"
5,Rick Steves' European Christmas,"I loved reading about the customs in the varied cultures the book covers. I even used the Lebkuchen receipt. It makes for a great read to prepare you for Christmas! The photos give you a feeling that you are a participant, and no one looks staged, they look like they are genuiniely having fun and celebrating. Great for a curl up with a throw and hot chocolate."
5,"Easy assembly, sturdy, great value","Quick assembly (15 minutes, 17mm wrench). Very sturdy with no wobbling when standing on small carpet on garage floor. Using all 7 storage bars for York iron weights (275 lbs) and Best Fitness iron weights (70 lbs). Wife pleased that she no longer has to maneuver around weight plates on the floor. I should have purchased this years ago - it is a great way to organize your weights."
4,Nice Design - Reasonably Priced..,"Finally I have my weight plates off the floor! I gave this 4 stars as I wasn't that impressed with the frame welding. I guess workmanship isn't a top priority at the off-shore company that makes these, just quantity and functionality. Also, the packaging was sub-standard - the frame was protruding from the box upon arrival. Thankfully the frame is power-coated for a durable finish..."
2,This thing's crappy.,"The title's true. It's crappy indeed. It does work; just not how I, or I'd expect anyone else, would like it to. It wobbles on the floor and the spacing between the pegs isn't very good. The side with three pegs really can't hold any size plate on the middle peg without being in the way of any sized plate on the top peg. So that's a useless peg that also renders its neighbors useless for larger sized plates--35s won't clear the said middle peg when hung on the top peg and won't clear any other sized plate on the middle peg if hung on the bottom peg. Even though this thing would still wobble, it'll be much improved by sawing off the middle peg."
3,"A good, but uneven, book on close combat","Cold Steel is considered a classic book on close combat, and rightly so. It covers many aspects of the subject, including knife and bayonet fighting, stick fighting, knife throwing, and unarmed combat.The book's weakness is its section on knife fighting techniques. Based on classical fencing, these are deadly. For the person using them. They are totally unworkable in a real-world situation -- whether on the battlefield or on the street.On the other hand, the stick and unarmed techniques are easy to learn and brutally effective. These two sections of Cold Steel are well worth the price."
2,Looks nice but it scared my baby,"This item was also a pain to put together. When I finally did get it together, I put my premie newborn in it and she had this look of panic on her face. She was actually scared of it. If she moved, I was afraid she was going to roll out of it. I recommend the Natures Touch Cradle Swing over the sway lounger. She's more comfortable in it and sleeps much longer."
2,I hope its worth it!,"Let me just say assembly required products must have better directions. I have put together everything myself, mainly because my husband doesn't like to read directions, however, this sway lounger without a doubt has been the most difficult item to put together thus far. Don't buy this for someone you like! I sure hope our baby loves this swing and I can write a new review stating how the 4 hour frustration was worth it! The bouncer is also very large and bulky and I have to agree with the comment about the sound effects are poor. Hope you have better luck with assemble than I did!"
4,Useful and interesting,"Benton manages to write a thorough text on various vertebrate groups and their evolutionary trends, mentioning specific important species and basic morphology without making the book as dry as a bone. As one can always state about books that are overviews, one could wish for more thorough coverage of personal groups of interest, but as an overview, this is a great book. The diagrams and phylogenetic charts are very helpful, and the case studies that are provided in offset boxes are very interesting.One major complaint about the book is the number of typos and mislabeled diagrams...it can become rather confusing. I have taken a pen to the book and with careful reading, re-reading and cross referencing, have corrected the errors in my own copy to save me the brain strain...but on the whole, this book does what one would want from it."
2,Uninspiring take on vertebrate evolution,"I'm a big fan of vertebrates in the evolutionary theater, and so was excited to purchase this book. And thats why I was disappointed by this dry and uninsightful account. I'd recommend Pough's Vertebrate Life for a more interesting and conceptual read."
4,Not a typical self-help book at all,"More a philosophy of living your life well, for yourself, your family and your community. Although there's not a lot new here, I really admire the clarity of the writing and thinking. Unlike self-helpers, this isn't telling you how to get rich--in fact, Espuelas insists that if money's all you want out of life, you're bound to fail. This is about figuring out what will make you the most fulfilled human being you can be, then planning how to achieve that. If more people thought and acted like this, it'd be a much greater country than it already is. Lots of interesting historical anecdotes and stories keep it a vibrant read--in fact, the writing throughout is of a caliber you rarely see in these kinds of books. No, this book won't change your life. It doesn't promise to. But it may inspire you to do it for yourself, and that's a much better gift. Gracias, Fernando Espuelas. You're a model of what America's supposed to be all about."
1,Use an IPO to become famous?,"Fernando Espuelas is the pets dot com sock puppet of the Latino space. He's famous, but for what? Pets dot com blew up as yet another example of the excess of the dot com bubble. So did StarMedia. Espuelas is a brilliant public relations person, but I'd never hire him; he'd use my money to promote himself. I wish shareholders of StarMedia could recover all the free advertising he gave himself as ""ceo."""
3,Twin Pre-Schoolers Got Bored,"I bought this book for my 3 year old twins to read before bed. It's less about twins and more about ""two siblings"" that invite a stranger over. It's actually really weird. The story is way too long for 3 year olds. I had to just make up a little story about the pictures.A better book is ""Just Like Me"" by Barbara J. Neasi"
4,Cute story,The twins liked it very much. A great throw back for those of us who read this series as kids.
4,What fun!,"No sinister plot -- just fun! Sure, it does get overly complex a few times, but the positive factors outweigh the negatives by a big bunch, especially at page 150 when Danilo's about to - - - - - terrific. And, as repeatedly noted, fun."
2,the car charger destroyed my battery...,"if i'd driven farther it might have kacked my entire phone.Cingular dealer said ""You MUST use Motorola brand - or it will fry the battery!"" You are thinking (as did i) he's just wanting to sell me a new battery that costs more than i paid for the phone! (Battery = $25+, phone $18 upgrade). Nope. He GAVE me a free new battery and asked me NOT to use the car charger.The mini USB was fine. I agree with the battery-giver - get the real thing. Besides motorola won't so much as take your CALL if you aren't ALL motorola down to your ""Hello Moto"" tighty whiteys! Word to the wisenheimer."
4,Quite an Achievement,"Waldemar Januszczak must be proud of this documentary, which retraces the footsteps of one of the greatest and most notorious artists the world has ever known. Having studied Gauguin for many years, I found so much more information to learn in this film. The only things that were kind of distracting were some of the inappropriate choices of background music, the constant close-ups of Januszczak and his sledgehammer in-your-face delivery as narrator. The camera work could've been better, too - some parts are dizzying hand held jerky scenes that are annoying. Notwithstanding, the scenes were amazing, seeing the chronology of Gauguin's paintings and the stories behind them, and hearing the locals speaking frankly about what Gauguin was really like was captivating, to say the least."
3,true pulp comics.,"This follows Tom Strong from his chilhood on a mysterious island where his parents trained him on a harsh gravity, to his most recent adventures as he nears the age of 100.Teaming up with his wife, daughter, butler robot, and super smart ape.The first three issues are okay, but it really works in the last four, showing one of the coolest characters of all time, the Pangean.This is an okay book and if you like Alan Moore and have a few bucks, pick this up."
2,Moore Filler,"This is the least interesting of his ABC comics collections. Tom Strong, a comicbook version of Doc Savage, manages to be tongue-in-cheek without being very funny. Fortunately, it doesn't take long to read through this book, since not a great deal happens. Moore has written a lot better elsewhere, both with superheroes and without."
3,Disappointing,"Solid, but not inspiring. Good art and an OK set of stories, but something is missing."
2,TOM WEAK,"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Alan Moore fan, that I've been a reader of his for over ten solid years now and that I count some of his work (WATCHMEN, SWAMP THING and FROM HELL) as the best comic art ever produced. That said, I have to tell you that this collection was almost a PAINFUL read for me. As much as I hate to admit it, Moore has lost his edge. There is nothing new or exciting in the tales presented here. The charcters are flat and one deminsional; the dialogue is strained at times; and, worst of all, I felt no emotional involvement in the stories whatsoever. Simply put, these are comics for kids. If you're over the age of 12, you'll find Tom Strong's adventures pretty weak indeed."
3,Great Idea But Only Average Execution,"Tom Strong is a tip of the hat to many classic comic book heroes and cliches. Tom Strong is based on Doc Savage, Solomon is based on the intelligent apes that populate the DC Universe, Tom's wife is like a cross between Wonder Woman and Storm of the X-men and so on. Having said that, there is a lot of originality in the book too. Without giving anything away, there are at least two characters in this book that are truly unique. I can't think of any other like them. I think all the characters in it are interesting but I don't think the story is as well executed as it could be. It starts off well but the collection seems to become less fun as you reach the end, although its never bad. Its not the best of Moore's ABC line (according to my experience that is A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) and its no where near his classic works, but its worth checking out if you are a fan. I will buy the next collection, but I don't have very high hopes for it."
5,New Corporate Cultures,"Corporate leaders need to re-visit corporate values to keep on track. Allan Kennedy and Terence Deal have put a message for corporations in their book. Corporations depend on their people - and people need to feel positive about their work and work situation to make the company fly. The book gets into outsourcing, downsizing, mergers, globalization, shareholder value, and cultural leadership. A wake-up book, written in clear, simple terms, a worthwhile read."
5,Great Book,I was forced to read this book for a class. The information is a little dated but it still very relevant today. I ended up really liking the books view on corporate mergers and how the CEO's stuck it to the working class.
3,Bone Dry not dry; a fast read,"Bone Dry by Bette & J.J. Lamb is a thriller about the theft of bone marrow from a hospital, held for ransom by a loathsome creep. Reads fast, some sex & violence, interesting medical stuff."
3,"Alright, but somewhat weak by today's standards","My father, a Vietnam-era Marine vet persuaded me to rent this movie (I would like to join up someday myself). I rented it, and I was expecting FULL METAL JACKET without cussing.Well, there isn't one ""damn"" or any other swear word in this movie, simply because of the era it was made in.The movie bored me a little, but many things were interesting, like Webb's cruel sense of humor, and the struggle between himself and stubborn recruit Owens. I REALLY could have done without the useless semi-romance between Webb and some ""dame"" he meets in a lounge.All in all, an _OKAY_ movie, it has its moments. An older Marine audience will appreciate this more, but for a younger audience, this is out of date.Give it a try.P.S. I actually visited where this film was made on more than one occasion, San Diego MCRD."
1,the DI,"I haven't received the movie yet, to review it. I am extremely disapointed in this purchase. If amazon doesn't try and resolve this matter, I will never purchase anything from them again."
4,One of the Best,"This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it."
5,Jack Webb / The D.I.,"Excellent product - couldn't even tell that this is a re-make - great sound & picture quality. Purchased for my dad who is a die-hard Marine down to the core and he even gives this purchase a 5 star rating, as he was VERY pleased with this product. Amazon did great in shipping also - didn't take long at all!"
4,The D.I. is a must for military collectors.,This movie is great fun. Should be used as a recruiting film. Comes as close to reality as possible for its time. Jack Webb was excellent. A MUST fo military movie collectors.
2,The DI,"Although I loved this movie as I did in 1966, I sent the first one back to Amazon because it wouldn't play on my DVD recorder / player. I wrote Amazon about this problem and they sent me the same exact DVD ! I had to go out and buy a DVD PLAYER in order to watch the movie. SO, unless you want to add another component to what you already have, I wouldn't but it."
5,Collector,Bought it for a friend of mine which is a collector himself and knowing him this must be worse watching as well as keeping
3,A staple for every Marine video library,"It takes a Marine to tell a story of Marines. In The D.I. Jack Webb brings out the role that haunts recruits who ever lived on Parris Island. Crisp and understated, Webb takes a group of young men and turns them into Marines. Footage of the old wooden barracks will bring back memories to Marines from the 50's, 60's and 70's. All in all one of the best depictions of a Marine drill instructor."
4,Get down and give me fifty!,No-nonsense Marine boot camp flick. Jack jump-starts confused recruits. Especially rewarding to those viewers who know the drill.
4,A must have for your collection,This movie really shows what boot camp was like way back when. It's a must have for any person who collects WWII movies. It's Jack Webb at his best!
5,A very good movie that not too many know about,I first saw this film on TV a long time ago on a local station that aired afternoon movies at the time I got home from school. It's basically Jack Webb being...well Jack Webb as a Marine drill instructor. I think it's an awfully entertaining movie that the whole family can enjoy and is a positive reflection of the United States Marine Corp of that era.
4,Couldn't put it down a wonderful novel,I felt this is a story that could really happen in our life time. I felt compassion and tenderness for Jane and Alex. I loved the way in which Christy's novel made me feel like I was visting a lovely old town in Vermont for the first time. It was very imaginative and brilliant.. I loved the twist about the murder. In all I would say Christy is well on her way to becomming one of Boise's great Authors. Thank you for writting this beautiful novel.
3,Not exactly Hoffman.,"""Practical Magic"" ain't what this book is. Too often the prose goes overboard until it is substanceless. A greater crime is the treatment of the main characters - Jane is a stereotypical can't-trust-men doormat, Graham is your usual passive-SNAG-good guy, Devon is the usual rebel without a cause.Jane's oscillating emotions and clueless behavior when it comes to men causes her to come off more often than not an immature woman who would be the first to appear on Jerry Springer. And of course, she can't trust men and she's not worthy of any men, while Devon can't be decent because he loves the notion of being unworthy of any decent woman too much. And Graham waits in the corner, the nice guy he is.Maybe next time. Until then, it's still ""Practical Magic"" for me."
3,"OK, uneven quality","I loved some of the stories, which is cherished for a short story collection...the knife thrower, clair de lune, consortium, sisterhood of the night, flying carpets were the best ... some i could not even finish they got so monotonous ... I will say he researches the heck out of his stories, but to me, he piles on details that eventually detract from the flow ... also, the endings to most of the stories left me flat.I would be curious to see him get into people's minds a little more, his style is overall too detached from humanity for my taste. Don't get me wrong, some of the stories were def. worth reading, but some of them dropped dead."
5,Lyrical genius!,"Twelve full tracks and 1 ""outtakes"" track (#13) with some rather hilarious content evidently from the recording studio where the album was recorded. Overall the album features some rather interesting points: the lyrics especially stand out to me. The Redding Brothers are lyrical geniuses in my opinion, and they don't limit their content to drab love songs and such. They write of some relatively high philosophical idiologies, such as carpe diem, live life to the fullest, aspects of death, etc. Remarkable. My favorite tracks were 'Rosebud', which I assume was written about Orson Welles' famous movie ""Citizen Kane""...a brilliant idea for a song -- and 'Misled', which sounds like it is based on a strange psychedelic journey through the head of a man in love. Overall, I would recommend this album and the artist in general over many of the top artists out there today. Two thumbs up, Redding Brothers!"
2,well named,"well, it is really rose absolue: rose, rose and rose again.but it is not a strong rose scent, rather soft.I am sure it can please some people, but it reminds me of my grandma! not a modern take on rose for sure."
3,"I hate to say it, but...","I guess I found this album disappointing because I love Common Children's ""Delicate Fade"" and ""The Inbetween Time"" and was expecting something as exceptional here. Well, let it be said that they worship God and get an automatic 5 stars for that. But style-wise, it's comparable to anything on K-Love and rather boring. Mark Byrd's voice is always beautiful, but his down-trodden style is a horrible fit for a peppy song like ""Wake Up,"" and Christine Glass, unfortunately, sounds like she's trying to hit each note prettily, which leaves out emotion entirely.So if you like what they play on the radio, get this because it does have very nice ""contemporary Christian"" songs. But if you're a Common Children or ""alternative Christian"" fan, this probably won't suit you."
3,Sweetblood,"Lucy is a bright, depressed-with-goth-leanings diabetic teenager with a theory that historical accounts of vampires are based on the physical effects of untreated, undiagnosed diabetes, who starts hanging out with vampire-wannabes. Lucy's cynical snarkiness gets a bit anooying, but it was nice to see a diabetic character who wasn't part of a problem novel about ""oh no, I just found out I'm diabetic! Angst, angst, however shall I cope? Oh, guess what, I coped!"" However, be prepared for the vampire stuff to play a less than pivotal part of the book."
5,best book i read,this book is so good i cant put it down.if i did not find this book i would not be able to read any books at school.
4,A great book,Sweet blood is a good book and I liked it because of the way the author wrote this book. It's an interesting look at the life of a diabetic gothic that likes vampires. This book has a lot of emotions raped all together. There is rapid mood swings. Lucy is a 15-year-old girl who is rebelling against everyone. She received her diabetes when she was a little girl. She picked up a baby bat and brought it home. The bat scratched her hands a lot. Her parents took her for rabbi shots she did not need. This is a great book.
1,This book was pathetic,"This book has hardly any Vampire stuff in it, which was what I was looking for. If you want to buy this book, MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A VAMPIRE STORY. It was a very negative book too. If I could do it all over again, I wouln't buy it at all."
2,bad. just bad.,"So, the theory was great and all..it's not like I've never heard it before...but the story was just downright horrible. It was the most dissapointing book I've read all year. May I ask where the heck the ending is? Oh yeah, there was none. I'm 14. I know a few authors my age who could've written a hecka better story, than that.Sorry, it sucked."
3,This book takes away from the mystery,"This book takes away from the mystery, darkness, and romance behind what a vapire can really mean. Its a very good theory that is expressed in the book. But i believe most teens are looking to get into a good Teen Vampire Romance...not hear about every reason why vampires arent real but their are freaky people who want to be like them....its still a good read, but not the typical vampire novel."
1,PG-13 Language,"There was quite a bit of language in this book, as well as a lot of sensual thoughts. Not to mention it was very boring."
4,Freaking love this book,"I came into the libray lookng for a book, and when I found Sweetblood, I thought "" Eh, I guess"". Once I read the great description on blood, I decided to think otherwise. Once the story went on, Lucy having thought that vampire stories originated of untreated diabetics made me more interested. In the end, it was a really great book."
3,something different,gives good insight into a different world many dont know much about - interesting very short book
5,"Enjoy this novel about ""vampiric"" people","I read a fair amount of Young Adult fiction, and I'm a fan of Angel/Buffy, so I thought I'd give this novel a try. Wow. Loved it! The best part was her theory that vampires are really untreated diabetics because it appealed to my scientific side. In addition it was a good novel about dealing with ""vampiric"" elements, whether they are blood-drinkers or predatory people in general. Read and enjoy!"
3,how a legend began,"This book is about a girl who thinks the myth about vampires got started from diabetic way long ago, and this is how. When they didn't know about insulin or anything to monitor their sugar level and there sugar level got too low they would start acting really weird. They would start to stay inside more because they were very sensitive to light. They would not sleep very much because they were constantly in pain. They also bite people for blood so they could get the sugar that was in the blood.Something I liked about the book is that it gives you a different aspect of how vampire legends got started. It also gives you incite to what may have happened to a diabetic. I didn't like the way they try to show that anyone who likes vampire is Goth.I would suggest this book to people who like vampire books but don't like the blood and gore would love it."
4,Good medicine,This bottle of meds was just as I was looking for and less expensive than the Dr wanted me to pay for it.
1,See no difference yet,"I was told about this formula b/c I am having trouble loosing weight, loosing hair, fatigue, etc. (all the signs of tyroid issues) and when I did my blood work my thyroid #'s were just a tad bit high ""but not high enough to be on meds the rest of your life"", per physician. I was told by a homopathic to ""check your bocy temperature b/4 you get out of bed for a week and if your temperature is low then you do have a thyroid problem"". Sure enough, my temp was low every day for 7 days, lowest being *92. So, it's been 3 weeks on this meds and my temp is still the same, haven't lost 1 lb. and just cant tell a difference one way or another. I will continue to take the whole bottle to see if anything changes and will keep it posted. OH, dont panic when you see your urine is green, I THINK THAT'S NORM b/c of the color of the pill. Good luck to all!"
2,Didn't live up to product description,"For a product claiming to boost energy, I find the ""adrenal"" component lacking. I don't feel any change in my energy levels. Since this multivitamin is considerably more expensive than others, and contains less nutrients, I'd stick with centrium or any other name brand multi. If you are looking for an adrenal containing product, don't go with Nutri West."
5,Tom Adams banjo picking is absolutely superb!,"As a beginning banjo player I was looking for a banjo player as my role model - Earl Scruggs, Bela Fleck or Roy Clark were one of my contenders. But then I discovered Right Hand Man CD after typing the keyword ""Cumberland Gap"" at a bookstore listening post. Tom Adams's banjo picking blew me out of my seat. His banjo picking is so crystal clear with the active thumb lead. Every song has sheer energy to it. It's hard to explain, but the music is fantastic. Even the fiddle and mandolin playing in the album are superb. I immediately declared Tom Adams as my banjo playing role model."
4,Great Reference Book,We use this book extensively in our tea store. Most commonly known tea plants are listed in detail. What i like best is the lists for different ailments and the plants that can be use help aliviate the symptoms.
5,"Thorough, researched herbal analyses","The author of this simple yet effective book on herbal teas wins your respect because she picks out her favorite teas and does her homework on them. I only wish there were an updated version of this book as research information has changed somewhat and new information is available. Noteworthy and also respectable is the inclusion of important cautions about any herbal teas that might not be safe for persons with various medical conditions. This is not a scientific book as we think of it. It's written for the lay person and based on some research the author did, absent scientific writing standards. All in all, it's one of the few good books out there on teas."
4,MatureFan,"Not quite as good as his ""Live Gypsy"" album, but I can't seem to get it out of my car player. Amazing versatility."
3,Ok,"This heater is ok- it doesn't dry out the air as much as heaters that blow out air. And it heats up the whole room fast. The only thing I don't like is that the thermostat isn't accurate. On setting 2 for example it might make the room 67 degrees or it might make it 73 degrees, and that's a big difference."
5,DeLonghi heater,"Our DeLonghi heater has been working great. Our heat pump went out in a spare room; it was really cold weather. When heater came, we plugged in heater with both lo and hi going. In minutes, the room was warmer; soon, we turned off the hi heat and let the lo take over. We have had an old DeLonghi for twenty years or so. The whole family has used it from time to time. This new one is just as good and seems like it cost less than our old, original heater. If we ever need another, DeLonghi is what we are buying."
5,space heater,I purchased this heater as a back up for extra cold days. Iam very pleased with it. It heats up a a room very efficiently and takes the chill out of a room pretty quickly. DeLonghi sure stand up to their reputation.
5,Excellent!,"This DeLonghi oil-filled radiator heater is the best!It is totally silent, excepting for a slight click when the thermostat kicks in and heats my good sized bedroom through the night with total warmth and comfort. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants the same."
3,Arrived used but in working condition,When the product was delivered it was clear that it has been used before. But since it does work as described we decided to keep it. It'd be nice though if Amazon would note somewhere in the product description that its condition is not brand new.
2,hmmm,Good heater. Love that the surface doesn't get very hot to the touch. When turned to medium it clicks a LOT as though it's trying to start up over and over...not sure if it's just this unit or a typical issue...
2,Oil filled may not stay that way - Mine leaks and the Mfg will not stand behind it.,"The heater works fine, but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet. DeLonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period. I will not buy an oil-filled heater again."
2,One month of use.,I only had one month of use with this product. Loved it while it worked but then the wire on the inside burned out and the cost to fix it was about the same price as the product.
5,Good product for less than $50,It is good design with strong body while cute look.It warms up a bed room very efficiently.We actually bought another one soon after the first one.
4,Like it,"We bought this heater last winter and used it very well.I was worry about the wheels (they looked very week), but they are ok until now.If we need more heater this winter, I will buy the same one."
4,Can't beat cheap heat!,What can I say? It makes heat when I turn it on and it cools down when I turn it off. Pretty Neat Heat for the money!
1,Life-threatening device,"Bought this heater yesterday and plugged it in for the first time this evening. Had it on for several hours. About 1 a.m. my daughter woke to a sickening smell and a loud noise. Her room was filled with smoke. The heater had literally blown up-exploded! and sent hot oil about eight feet or more all over the drapes, her bed, everything in its path. The heater was blown backward. Fortunately, her face was at the other end of the bed, or she would have been covered with the oil! The smellwas tremendous! Got it at Lowes, taking it back to Lowes and contacting the manufacturer. Don't buy this item, anywhere. I just hope we don't all have cancer now, no telling what kind of oil this this was heating!!!! And just for the record, afterbeing on for several hours, the heating capability was pathetic. Had a Lakewood brand from WalMart of the same type that would run you out of a room it heated so well."
1,Amazon is EXPENSIVE!,Amazon is selling this item for $50.00 plus shipping. Try your local store first---found them for $35.00 each no shipping charges
4,"great heater, very quiet","This little heater works well! The snap-down wheels made it very easy to install (no assembly required). The thermostatic variable control works well (unlike some others I have tried). Some reviewers reported smelling an oil or paint smell when they first turned it on, however, I did not have that issue at all. Since I only obtained my heater at the end of this years heating season, I haven't yet fully tested the high heat setting, but on the low setting, it kept my 20 x 14 foot room quite comfortable this spring. It makes no noise that I have been able to tell, except a very slight click when the heater turns on at the thermostat setting."
4,"Works pretty well, not completely cool to the touch","I got this for our 3-year-old daughter's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater. It does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room, which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night. I wouldn't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room. The top and back do get hot, although you'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned; bumping into it should not cause any burns. I haven't noticed any odors or noises from it."
3,Takes a long time to heat a room,"I put this heater in a small bedroom. It is very slow to heat the room. You have to turn it on a couple of hours before you go to bed. And be sure to close the door to the room. If your house is drafty this heater probably won't satisfy you. Don't expect it to heat a large family room. It gets hot to touch and is absolutely silent.Update (Two Months Later): It's working ok in a small bedroom 11x11. There are three settings. Turn the setting to #2 for an hour then turn down to #1 for all night. You can set it to maintain a specific setting. If I keep the bedroom door closed when sleeping, the room gets very warm. This heater is quiet...no noise except for a click when it cycles on."
4,Nice even warmth,"This is the second DiLonghi radiator space heater I purchased. The first one was for my large basement studio, which rarely goes above 55 degress F. My husband appropriated it during this long, cold winter, forcing me to purchase a new one for Valentine's Day.Pros: Even heat, safe temperature. You can touch the radiator while it's in use and not burn yourself. It is safe for smaller rooms, too. Silent! The one handle on the side is welcome for dragging it.Cons: It takes a while to heat up, which is understandable. After all, there is no forced air, no flame, etc. It is also an energy hog. The lights dim slightly when we turn it on, and there is no chance of running the treadmill and the heater at the same time. A second handle would also be a good idea, which would allow it to be carried more easily.This heater is great, though. It's safe, adjustable and reliable. I recommend it for anybody!"
4,The Frog Prince-aple Returns!,"Mr. Bundy loves his school, but finds himself unexpectedly turned into a frog. While he waits to be returned to his normal self, he makes a deal with some students to let him, as a frog, be the principal while the ""real"" one is gone. The kids try to break the promise, just like ""The Frog Prince"" story, but Ms. Moore, a teacher, requires them to keep their promise. The students try hard to adjust to the new principal. Weeks go by, when one day, just as unexpectedly, Mr. Bundy is returned to his normal body. Well, almost normal. The illustrations are delightful; I especially liked the tie. This will be fun to read aloud. Be sure to compare/contrast with all the various Frog Prince versions out there for some fun activities."
4,a good reference.....,One of the very good references for study of Object oriented programming and understanding C++.
1,Buy this book if you want to acheive a state of confusion...,"This is by far the worst text on computer programming I have ever read. The layout does not follow any logical pattern, the explanations are sketchy and unclear, and in some places the author's tone is downright pompous. Within a chapter, the author skips from topic to topic without completely covering the material. There are too few exercises at the end of each chapter to allow sufficient practice. Also, the book should have been in a larger (i.e. 8.5""x11"") format, thereby making it less thick. (Try stuffing this monster in an already full backpack.)The author may have experience with the subject matter, but he needs lessons on how to teach it to others."
3,Repetitious but not all bad,"I used to do this video years ago and gave it away. I've since repurchased it because I'd remembered that it was a good workout. Now that I have had a chance to get reaquainted with the workout, I find it repetitious borderline boring. If I allow my mind to wonder, which I found hard not to do, I find myself in the position of talking myself out of it. The constant up, up, down, down, may have been all the rage when this video was produced but in the days of more exciting mores, it lacks the fun factor. Having said that it gets great remarks for showing the foot movements, even though I didn't need them, I thought if today's video's panned down to show us the foot patterns, we may not need to do so much reminding to get it."
4,Good job by Keli Roberts,"I like Keli Roberts and I have all of her tapes.This tape is good but Cher's comments and outfit really annoys me.Step workout is very intermediate level, I even did not sweat.I like abs workout and lower body workout on this tape. I use those in combination with a step workout from other tapes I have."
5,Most fun and challenging workout ever!,I've been doing this workout for years - I have never grown bored of it! I really wish it was on DVD though!
5,No-nonsense workout,"I have done this step aerobics tape since I was a sophomore in high school (I am now 22), and I still love it.The step aerobics section is divided into clear, concise sections and is easy to master. Once mastered, it is easy to push yourself by adding a step level or adding weights.The music is pretty good and the instructor isn't flaky or fake.I think the biggest ""negative"" thing I can think of for the step aerobics section is Cher's outfit. :-) But it's easy to ignore that once you get over the initial shock.The abs section is quick and effective for upper abs. It also helps strengthen your back.By far, this is the best and most-used tape in my collection. Tried and true, it's a no-nonsense workout."
5,BEST EVER -- Let's See it on DVD!!!!,"Cher, or distributor of Cher Fitness, please make this workout available on DVD! This is THE BEST fitness program that my sister and I have ever done. Challenging, fun, concise, EFFECTIVE, totally non-cheesy alternative with awesome music! We still do the abs program every week, and not a week goes by when we do not wish that it was available on DVD. Please, please preserve this CLASSIC workout by putting it on DVD format and introducing it to a new generation of workout aficionados -- it stands the test of time!"
5,"Best one I've got, and I've got a LOT!","This is the only exercise video that I use on a consistent basis. I do like my Kathy Smith videos, and Tae-Bo and others, but this is the one that started me on the road to looking good and feeling great. Cher is a hoot, and the instructor is natural and easy to follow and doesn't make me nauseated with fake sweetness and ""motivational pep-talk"". This video produced the first visible results in my body that I'd seen in years, and it holds a very special place in my fitness video library. I still use it often, and still get great results. Try it, you won't be disappointed. (As far as the ""dated"" comments go, this was made in 1990 or 91, so consider that.) I love the music, and Cher wouldn't be herself if she wore something conservative, now would she? I don't care what she's wearing, she motivated me more than ANY other person in any exercise video I've ever used!"
5,The Best Exercise Video Out There!,I LOVE this video! I used my old copy of the video so much I had to repurchase it! This is a great cardio workout with easy to follow instructions ...not like some of those videos out there with all the fancy moves that takes you a year to learn. The ab workout that follows the step workout is KILLER but it does work. Last but not least is the standing floor workout...as if your legs weren't tired enough from the stepping! Thanks Amazon.com for carrying this video as I searched all over in the stores and couldn't find it anywhere!
5,AWSOME,This is the best workout tape I have ever owned! I have gone to the gym and their so called fitness experts have never given me a work-out like the Cher tape has. You really see and feel the results after doing the tape two times. the tape is fun & the music is great! I'm waiting for her to put out a new tape. I would buy it in a minute!
5,Very fun and easy!,"I have had this tape for years, and it is the only one that I consistently use. Instruction is extremely easy to follow, and Cher has fun with it. Also, while this is Cher's tape, it is her instructor who gives the direction. Too many celebrities have tapes where they are demonstrating the exercises and it's not their place to do so. All in all, a great workout!"
5,"An excellent, definitive, ""user friendly"" how-to guide.","The Everything Get Published Book is a definitive, step-by-step, ""how to"" instructional guide for turning book ideas into published works. Peter Rubie's easy-to-follow instructions on how to write proposals, get an agent, attract the attention of editors and publishers are solid, sound, and essential.

Also covered is the new phenomena of electronic publishing, writing seminars, author networking, and a great deal more!"
3,dont even bother,"general information too precise that it doesnt really help you. Very very basic and you can find the information just surfing the net, but that its put in a book but it doesnt offer anything more or helpful."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. It seems to be outdated, and it did not give me much of an incite as to how to get published."
1,not everything,"When you see title ""Everything"" you expect everything. Well,it is not. Freedom of speech is not mentioned at all.OK. Copyrighted material use not mentioned at all.OK. Adult books industry not mentioned at all.OK. Publishing outside US not mentioned at all.OK ...and so on."
5,"Excellent, easy to use cleanser","This is an excellent, easy to use cleanser for oily, yet sensitive skin. I have been impressed with how well this product removes all makeup, even eye makeup, without irritation or causing dryness to my skin. Also the light fresh scent does not aggrevate my sensitive skin and I will continue using this product. It will be easy to travel and camp with also!"
5,"Great infant shampoo, too.","When my granddaughters were infants they would spend days with me while their parents worked. This included the morning baths. Despite all the hype about tearless shampoos and baby soaps, none really were free of some kind of irritation to their little eyes. During a morning shower using Olay hydrating daily facial cloths I got some suds in my eyes. I cringed as I waited to feel the burn in my eyes. It never came. So I deliberately did it again. No burning. So I used it to wash the babies' bodies and their hair. It worked perfectly. Very mild on their skin, a fresh cloth for every bath, and no burny eyes when shampooing their hair if suds got into an eye. And they smelled great. too. As they got older the girls switched to regular shampoo for kids, but they still use the cloths when washing their faces. I love these little cloths for infants, little girls, and grammas."
3,Great face cloths but cheaper at Target,"I LOVE these face cloths. Have tried others and they don't get my face as clean as these cloths. I will say though, you can find a 60 pack cheaper at Target. Rarely does Amazon's prices get beaten but I found out after I purchased these that Target has them for $11.99. That's why I only did 3/5 stars. If the price was cheaper I would have rated higher because the product is great."
4,Cox Family Crosses Over,"With ""Everybody's Reaching Out For Someone"" the Cox Family not only states the obvious but turns it into a beautiful theme explored through tracks that cover the range from pure-hick bluegrass to countryish ballads. Featuring clean vocal harmony and accomplished instrumental work, the star of the album is how the Cox Family brings it all together, not just in their conciseness of arrangements, but in their ability to make country and bluegrass accessible to more general listeners. ""I've got that old feeling"" has all the changeups of mellow bluegrass with enough hooks to catch the most burnt-out pop listener and take him for a delightful ride."
4,Liked it very much!,"Pretty much like everything the Cox Family do. Suzanne has the voice of an angel, such passion and soul. Altogether they are the complete package, although (being biased toward Steel Guitar) Steel does add another dimension to their songs.I just wish they could put out more material of their own on this side of the pond! (UK)"
4,The Best of Bluegrass Gospel,A wonderful group of family gospel singers. The harmony and instruments are outstanding for this type of music.The family has been singing and playing instruments since the children were small. If you like close harmony this is the best.
2,Not quite what I had expected,"In my opinion, this book reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a well chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It offers no insights of significance into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing. In sum, I would say that the title is grossly misleading."
1,Regurgitation of Merck's PR handouts,"As an ex-Merck employee who was there during the stellar days of Roy Vagelos and has had to watch Ray Gilmartin and Peter Kim squander the legacy and the public trust of a once distinguished phramaceutical company, I take great exception to this trite, inaccurate ""informmercial"" of a book. The give away is the opening page - the Merck superman, not above fixing his own plumbing problems. Clark Kent where are you?This book is pathetic - stealing directly from Merck's circa 2000 PR materials. No mention of the great pharmacologists and medicinal chemistrs who set the stage for P. Roy's success - Clem Stone, Karl Beyer, Ralph Hirschmann, Paul Anderson, Brad Clineschimdt - just the story post Roy - with a number of patheric legends in their own minds taking center stage and leading Merck straight into the COX-2 fiasco.Merck once had great leadership, now it has Gilmartin's Don Knotts to George Merck's Andy Griffith.This book is worthless"
3,good book on how pharmaceutical companies operate.,the book is an eye opener for those who have no idea of how a pharmaceutical company operates. it is very detailed from the conception of a drug to its marketing. it praises and also hits the pharmaceutical industry.well written and easy to understand. highly recommended.
4,Mormonism Really is a Cult,"I am a Christian and have many family members who live the mormon lifestyle, I hate that they are deceived and need to make sure I continually pray that they will see the light and that they will learn that Jesus is the only Way, Truth and Light! So thankful that these people were very brave to leave the mormon cult and do everything they could to prove by research that Mormonism is not real and is a cult. I hope all who can will get out and turn to the one true Lord!!!! Very thankful for the author and their friends to stand up for Gods word!!!! All Mormons need to read this book no matter how much they dont want to!"
1,BLECH!,"Can I rate this less than one star? I got through the first few chapters before I decided I could make better use of my time pulling weeds. I appreciate Ms. Robertson's desire to share her feelings, but she comes off as playing The Victim to a conspiracy to steal her soul. The story is ""true"" as far as her interpretation of what happened, not necessarily based on facts. Knowing that she was once a member, the use of ""Mormonism"" is particularly irritating."
1,Amusing,"This book is no more than amusing Evangelical Christian proselytizing. I giggled often, especially during the passages when Ms. Robertson described her and her husband's seeing the light when comparing Biblical scripture with Mormon doctrine. Yep, Mormon beliefs are weird. So are Scientology, Catholic, Muslim, etc... beliefs. And yes, so are even Evangelical beliefs.I was somewhat entertained by the first part of the book (though I found the writing to be unprofessional), it was a pretty quick read. But the second half was predictable and unpersuasive."
1,I am and will always be a mormon,I am a mormon and know that the mormon church is true and that god loves all of us Amen
4,Honest & Open,"Judy shares a lot of inner thoughts and practices of the mormon church. Her emotion is apparent in the book about how the church affected her life. I think it gives great insight as to how she discovered the truth and she provides biblical references. This may not be a book to buy your female mormon friends unless they have recently opened up as she suggests in her book. She shares about the temple ceremony, why mormon women have so many babies, how the mormon religion twists words & fails to teach individual thinking, a woman's relationship and role in the mormon church and how to witness to mormons."
4,Must Read,This book is very interesting. It's a must read for anyone who is interested in finding the truth about different religions.
4,Compelling story,The author did a decent job of allowing the reader to follow her family's journey through Mormonism and subsequent realization of errors she found in the Mormon theology.
3,"Interesting subject, very poorly done.","This is a interesting subject, she has a lot of avenues to follow but I found it was written like a jr high school term paper. There is a lack of depth to her writing and I am very glad I did not pay to read this book. So much more could have been done with the church functions and the references that dispute them."
4,Follow God,It was a great book. I'm glad they family got out when they did. My prayers go out to them.. May GOD Bless them
1,Boring Book,"This book was very boring. I was forcing myself to continuing reading, I finally gave up and started another book. Don't waste your time on this book."
2,Bitter and whiny,"I snagged this when it was free. I was curious because one of my best friends as a child was Mormon.The author claims to be a Christian but she is so obviously filled with hatred for Mormons, it very contradictory. She left one church because someone hurt her feelings, and she and her husband converted to Mormonism. She states they had doubts from the beginning, yet still converted. Her overall whiny and sarcastic tone is not at all Christlike.Additionally I don't think this book saw an editor. It was replete with typos and looked like a sloppy term paper.The only reason this book garnered 2 stars from me was because of the description on the temple ceremonies. It was interesting although the author's sarcastic tone is heavy here as well."
1,How sad for Judy...,"...that she feels compelled to break the covenants she made in the temple. There are no ""secret"" rites, but there are very sacred ones. To me, this is like someone who has a Top Secret clearance with the government, and once they leave government employ, they reveal everything they know.Many people do have trouble living the LDS lifestyle--for it truly is a lifestyle, and not just a Sunday religion. Jesus is the Way, and as Christians, we strive to follow that Way every day of the week, every minute of the day.If someone leaves the Catholic church or the Methodist church, you never see a book about ""out of Catholicism"" etc. Than why this need to justify leaving the ""Mormon"" church?"
5,Excellent Read,An amazing true story of how a family exchanged the truth of the Bible for the lifestyle and heresy of a false cult and how God brought them out of it again. A must read for any who are struggling with the man-made rules and regulations of Mormonism or other man-made religions. Jesus Christ is God...not Satan's brother!
4,Good book,This was an excellent book. I especially liked the way the author listed specific doctrines and the Biblical counterpart to compare. The whole part about the temple visit was astonishing. If it looks like a cult and sounds like a cult....
3,Heartfelt but poorly written,"Clearly not a professional writer, Judy Robertson offers a glimpse of her life and the tension she felt as a member of the Church of Later Day Saints which are not what one might expect from the glowing portrayal of life in the Mormon community a casual glance would suggest.I would offer that there is tension whenever you try to live both a public and a private life, especially when you are trying to live up to certain expectations as if your eternal destiny depended on it. Robertson finally realizes that ""doing"" to earn/maintain your salvation is not the grace that from God. If you are not familiar with many of the criticisms of the Mormon faith, you might be surprised at the theological points which differ from historical, orthodox Christianity."
4,Very informative,"Book was very informative about Mormans. Written from a woman's perspective. It told how as a family, they adjusted after leaving the Morman Church, and how they found a stronger Christian faith. A worthwhile read."
1,Blah,"Poorly written, not detailed enough to be sucked into the story. Hard time understanding why she didn't go to her bishop or missionaries to get her questions answered, all she did was rely on her own ""knowledge"" and let her confusion blossom into disbelief. Understanding Mormonism can be a challenge, and if her story is true as it's written, I feel bad for her she didn't have a better support system. I also didn't appreciate how many things she got wrong about the LDS church and she did an awful job distinguishing actual doctrine versus the culture. One example of this is when she says that every Mormon woman's job is to reproduce as much as possible. Not! It's unfortunate that some women feel this way, but the goal is certainly not to be turned into a baby machine. This is just one of many examples of things she twists around about the church. I feel very sorry for her and her family, but I wish her happiness."
1,"Most of the doctrine shared is correct, but not all","Most of the doctrine of mormonism discussed here is true, but not all. My biggest problem with this story is the fact that she includes details of the temple ceremony that she promised not to. Members of the mormon church view those signs and symbols as sacred.A cautionary tale to never join a church you don't believe in. Peer pressure is not a good reason."
1,Please don't believe everything you read.,"I thumbed through this book for about an hour. Being LDS myself and having gone through the ceremonies that she attempts to describe, I was offended at the half truths and twisting of facts in this book. Beware of literature like this and seek to find out the truth for yourself. People can write whatever they want but Jesus will never lead you astray."
2,Read for yourself.,"Not particularly riveting, as books go, but it is certainly good to read for one's self.If you were disappointed by this book, why not read what Thomas Stuart Ferguson wrote to the LDS church at the end of his career."
3,The most insight into Mormonism yet,"I read this book because I was interested in learning more about Mormonism; not as a potential convert, just as a Christian who's curious. It was definitely the most detail about what it's like living as a Mormon that I've ever read. I wouldn't give any awards for the style of writing-it wasn't very creative-but it got the point across. We know based on the title that she joins and then leaves Mormonism, but I expected more details on what Mormonism is like; she decided to leave around 60% of the way through the book, and the rest was detailing their plight to expose Mormonism as a non-Christian religion, help other Mormons get out, etc. In summary-I recommend it to get a glimpse into what it's like in the Mormon church, but once she decides to leave, you wouldn't be missing anything if you stopped reading there."
5,AWESOME!,"This book is amazing I recommend that anyone who is not a mormon, or has been a mormon in the past or whom may still be in mormonism to read this book it is radicale and very very insightful."
4,In's and out's of Mormonism,"Judy Robertson gives a layperson's view of how a family gets caught up in Mormonism, finds out more about its beliefs and practices, and then leaves it for Christianity. For Christians who have no understanding of that process, this testimony would be a good place to start. Its style is candid and unpretentious and not meant to be professional.Robertson's account poignantly conveys the hurts, rejections, and personal attacks which often occur in the process of leaving Mormonism. I especially appreciated her sharing of her children's perspectives on their spiritual journey--they are a feature unique to this book.My only disappointment is that this release is a retitled reissue of an earlier book. I think it would have been more fair to the buying public to retain the original title."
2,"Skip this one, there's better ones out there","I'm very interested in other religions (I'm Christian) and have read a number of books out there on Mormonism and my opinion is that this one just isn't as good as all the others. The main character is interested in the sense of community Mormons have, but seems to doubt and dislike all of the Church principles and ceremony... yet she still goes forward with formally joining the church?! I can understand having difficulty leaving a religion once you're in, but I had a hard time, and was honestly somewhat offended, with her joining something she didn't even believe in from the beginning. After her story of leaving Mormonism the book got too Jesus preachy for me and although I finished it's a few hours of my life I'm not going to get back."
5,X-cellent read!!!,"This book is a excellent read!!! Not boring, keeps you turning the pages! I enjoyed the book so much, I'd like to read it again. Very informative book. Clearly shows how controlling the Mormon church is. At the end of the book it compares Christian scriptures to the book of Mormon. Easy read."
2,The constant Mormon-bashing detracted from the story,"I understood the passion of the author as she recounted her life and experience in Mormonism. The first part of the book about the author's transition into Mormonism and her experiences living the life of a Mormon was interesting. The last part of the book was devoted to the author's efforts to ""expose"" the perils of Mormonism while extolling and preaching about her next religion. The author's bitterness towards Mormonism is apparent as she tells of leaving the religion and her efforts to denigrate Mormon beliefs through newspaper advertisements and presentations. It reminded me of negative political TV advertisements. I tired of the author's attempts to try to convince the reader that her invisible God is better than the Mormon's invisible God. A marginal read and not the best book I have read about Mormonism."
2,"Excellent Author, But Not This Time","I found this book to be tedious and confusing, I was glad when I came to the last page.Kathy Reichs is an excellent author, and she evidently based her story on some real facts, but it just didn't go anywhere for me."
2,Not Up To Her Usual Standard,"Unlike all the other Reichs novels that I have devoured as quickly as I had time to read them, this book was slow going for me. It's not that the story wasn't engaging, or that Tempe wasn't her usual smart self. The book was just missing the same level of intrigue and engagement that has made me someone who buys a Reichs book as soon as it is available. Maybe because the locale is so exotic, Reichs focused more time on it than on the interactions of her main characters such as Tempe and Ryan. I missed what I hoped would be the next installment of Ryan, Tempe's daugher, and Birdie the cat. Heck, I even missed Tempe's ex-husband who has been a bit of a pain in the butt throughout the series. Here is hoping that Reichs' next Brennan novel brings us back home to the U.S. and Canada with a less colorful, but more substantial mystery."
3,Book condition - price,I would have expected the book to be in a bit better condition considering a price of over $9.00. Cover bent and definitely had been well read.
2,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed in this book. I've been reading the Tempe Brennan books in order. This one seems never ending. It's kind of boring and hard to follow. I'm almost at the end and I can't wait for it to be over. I don't want to stop reading them. So, I hope this was just a bump in the road. I normally enjoy the other books."
2,Good watch but band mount broke,I gave this watch to my father and it worked great but the pins that hold the band on came out of the platic holes they go in. The holes got all enlarged and worn and would not hold the pins so the band was useless. Now the watch sits in a drawer and is not used.
1,"Good time, awful band/crystal/manual","Why go any further? It works well, but the manual is written on a pin head (get one off the 'net), the crystal is very soft, and the worst for last: the band has broken several times, replaced once at an outrageous price, then I finally gave up. Other Casio watches have decent bands, why not this one?"
3,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Atomic Watch #VA104HLA-8AV,The exact same watch I had before (purchased by Hammacher Schlemmer catalog in 2006) wore out at the wristband (which was made of leather) and therefore snapped and was irreplaceable. I wish this watch had a stretch band so that it would last longer. Hammacher Schlemmer stopped selling this model watch in early 2007. Perhaps Casio stopped making this model.
4,Casio does it well and inexpensively,"Casio's Men's Ana-Digi Atomic Watch (VA104HLA-8AV) is a bargain for us anal time-keepers. Inexpensive, reliable, more functions than anyone but an electronic fanatic would want, and looks ok."
1,Band broke,"Purchased this watch December 2005. The band broke July 2006. Casio would not replace the band, but would sell me another one for over $20.00. Very cheap band. Think I would order a better watch from a more reliable company."
4,A great watch with lots of features,"I received this watch about a year ago and am very pleased with it. The time synchronization feature works great! I travel alot, and I particularly like that I can have 2 timezones on the watch - I keep my home time on analog and show local time in digital. The watch has alot of features that I don't use: stop watch, timers, alarms, etc. The only downside is that it's difficult to remember how to access all the features - they require pressing several different buttons. But the manual is clear (although the type is miniscule) so I can figure it out.All in all, it's a great watch at an outstanding price."
2,Atomic Watch Review,"The watch keeps good time.However, the band started falling apart in less than 30 days.Also, very difficult to use the side buttons adjust settings and illuminate."
1,Looks pretty good. Works very bad.,"I picked this up because I liked the combination of analog and digital, especially with the atomic syncing and at about $30, it looked like a great deal.The watch NEVER managed to sync up with the signal, however, and strangely, the analog and digitial times ended up out of sync. The digital functions are unnecessarily complicated enough to make them all but useless.This watch has found it's way into the garbage."
2,Not that good,"As someone who makes her own lotion and has tested oils on the skin from regular olive oil to all natural shea butter, I will have to say that this product is overhyped. It doesn't do anything that it claims it does and it's moisturizing properties are not that good. While it is more moisturizing than olive oil, it pales in comparison to plain old pure unrefined shea butter. If you want ultimate moisture, this product is not it. Just go use shea butter."
5,Met all expectations,"Outstanding product.I am very happy with the craftsmanship and quality of the holster, the safety release is an outstanding system. A little stiff in the beginning but when you wear it for a week or so it will loosen up."
4,"High Quality,",Good quality leather and made well. You will need to practice the draw. The release takes some getting use to.
4,boot review,He likes them hasn't wanted to keep them on. We are hopping (hoping) he will start wearing them....get it... It's a frog that hops. LOL
5,Great value!!,I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for use around the yard when it's wet and soggy. She loves it! The hooks on the side lets here be able to pull them on. Word of advice - she needs to wear socks to prevent her ankles getting bruised while rubbing on the inside.
1,Buy at your own risk,"These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order. I emailed Western Chief for a size chart. I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me. Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot. I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots. I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back. Of course that was a week ago.I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong? The bad customer service was just the cherry on top :("
1,"Disappointing, Very Poor Quality","I bought these boots for my twenty-month-old. They cracked and began disintigrating in one week of moderate use in Springtime temperatures, mud, and puddles. They do not come in widths, because, as we parents know, all children are the same size. Hence, they fit REALLY well (note the sarcasm here).I'm amazed that anyone has given them a decent reveiw. What a waste of hard-earned money! I only gave it one star because zero was not an option."
4,Sized Correctly,"I followed the reviews stating to order a smaller size than your child wears and was very disappointed to find that they were too small. I had just had my child's foot measured at Nordstrom about a week before ordering these. His foot measured as an 8. I was planning on ordering a 9, but followed the advise of the other reviews and instead ordered an 8. When they arrived, they were too small. Now I have to pay twice as much in shipping to get the correct size, which defeats my savings of ordering them on here in the first place. I'd recommend NOT going smaller!!"
1,not so sturdy,"I am sorry to say that this boot, or any western chief boot, is not nearly sturdy enough for a 4 year old. He has had 3 pair of this type of boot and EVERY pair has split at the sole and upper juncture. They have also split near the frog's eyes. While we love the boot's look...it is not economical to buy a boot that lasts, at the most, only 6 weeks."
2,Cute but not durable,"My four-year old needed new rainboots and fell in love with these frog boots. They are very cute, but after just one weekend of kicking around on a beach, they are completely scuffed up and look like they are a year old. My son doesn't care, but it looks to me like they won't last very long before they develop leaks at this rate. We have had Xtratufs for kids before, and they are by far the most durable rainboot I know of (my second son is using hand-me-down Xtratufs that are still in great shape), but they are a dull olive color and, as far as my 4YO is concerned, they can't compete with more colorful versions."
3,Plan on buying a size smaller than your child usually wears!,"I agree with the previous mom who wrote a review. We actually bought ours at Target as well, and the sizing is quite off. Plan on buying a size smaller than your child usually wears! Other than the sizing issue, the boots are super cute and my son absolutely loves them. He likes to wear them around the house for dress up play as well.... we don't get much rain where we live."
3,Good Product,The boots were a little pricey for what they were. But my kids love them and they are sturdy rain boots. The delivery on them was super fast especially for Christmas season.
4,Cute and comfortable,"These boots are very cute and seem to be holding up well through gentle use. My son has worn them about 4 times. They are nicely and deeply treaded on the bottom. Since we use them only infrequently, I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars since I can't comment much as to their ruggedness. I bought them a little larger than his regular size, since their main purpose is for puddle jumping, and fit is not that important. I'd just as soon put an extra pair of socks on him now and get another year of use out of them! LOL"
5,My uncle's story,"This is the story of my Uncle Ralph who came to America from Poole, England when he was twelve years of age in 1913. It is an easy, yet informative story about growing up in the great northwest in the early 20th century. He moved to Seattle during the Great Depression eventually marrying the older sister of my mother in the same year as I was born. In 1960 he and his wife moved back to Duvall where he served on the city council and also as mayor.Taylor Park in Duvall is named after his uncle and due to his work, King County sold a strip of land to the City of Duvall for the price of $15 in back taxes that was named Taylor Landing on the bank of the Snoqualmie river.I heartedly recommend this to anyone interested in local history."
5,Stanley Garage door safety beams,"Received the package within 5 days after order was placed, which was much quicker than I expected. Took the old one down (which had not been working properly for some time) and replaced it with the new one and it works flawlessly . Thank you, excellent service and prompt shipping!"
1,History Book - Not a How too book,"This book is ok if you want a cute little lesson on the BMW2002 series. As to it being a restoration guide, well it leaves a lot to the imagination and very little helpful and practical tips and photos. Save your money and find forums online."
2,"A great book, but lacking.","I bought this book in hopes that it would be a manual or a guide, but basically it's just a tips and tricks along with what the author did to his various '02s. It is an interesting read, but it isn't really a guide in my eyes. It didn't really have any walk-throughs or anything of the sort. All of the information in the book I gathered before it arrived by reading various 2002 forums and websites and now that I think about it, it makes sense because the book was written over a decade ago. If I knew then what I knew now, I would still buy it, but I would definitely buy a proper manual along with it."
4,BMW '02 Rest. Guide,"This is a great book for both the first time '02 owner and the the long time '02 owner! This book is very clear and thorough and gives great tips on how to restore your beloved '02. Some time times this book is not technical enough though and if you are looking for a book with engine breakdowns and wiring diagrams you should get the BMW 1602 and 2002, 1959-77 (Haynes Manuals). I recommend buying both these books to get the best of both worlds!"
3,"Good ethics, but it's out of date","The ethics ideas presented are relevant, but the book is out of date. Most of the examples are from the early 90's. Since this was an assigned text for a class I didn't have a choice."
3,only one,"I purchased this snake for a work project and there was only one. The title was misleading. The item is fine, but was expecting more than one."
5,Fantastic cookbook for Vegans AND Vegetarians,"I really like this cookbook and use it just about every week.There is a great variety in here and every recipe can be adapted for Vegans like myself. There are great entrees,dips,desserts,appetizers, you name it.The five spice oatmeal cookies are a favorite in my home as well as the mexican casserole. Most of the recipes require ingredients you can easily find at your grocery store.I highly recommend this cookbook, I bought it for five dollars new and it was well worth it!"
2,Disappointed with recipes,"I really thought this book would really give more basic recipes from kitchen foods that one would have on hand every day, rather than chef prepared foods."
1,Wheat-meat anyone?!,"I looked forward to getting this book and am extremely disappointed! No pictures at all! I hate cookbooks without pictures! What makes you want to try recipes is when you can see the final product. I got this along with The Happy Herbivore and this book does not even compare. Unless you want a cookbook full of tofu and ""wheat-meat"" recipes this book is not for you! If i see the word wheat-meat one more time i swear i will scream! :)"
3,Robin...........Robin..............,"I enjoy Robin Millers' show in The Food Network. I'll use this book, even if it's Robin Robertson..............."
3,Only 3 burger recipes!?!,"Dang, I was really hoping this book would have more ""meat"" and potato recipes, you'd think right?!? Why are there so many desserts and salads? I'll admit the Fresh Strawberry Pie sounds good, especially being raw and all, but gosh darn it! I wanted like mounds of seitan recipes, cutlets, lots of burgers and recipes on just about every way to prepare potatoes..hey, there's only one red potato recipe!?! Robin Robertson's cookbooks are great, I love Vegan Fire & Spice, but this book wells up a few tears..."
5,WOW what a book.,"I did not grow up a vegitarian. I grew up enjoying My mother's hearty meals. I have been a vegitarian now for 18 years and have longed for one of those hearty meals. Over the years my wife and I have found resturants on our travels that offered hearty meals but we could never get copies of the recipes. On a recent visit to my brothers he and his wife recommended this book. The first recipe I prepared was a pot pie and was it good! My wife is waiting for me to make another one. We both enjoy researching the recipes and making them. But, we enjoy eating them even more! If you like cooking, but don't like bad surprises then get this book. We have never found a bad recipe."
4,Wonderful Fun!,"I wasn't enamoured with ""Going to Chicago"", but thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Having grown up in a town like Tuttwyler, I feel as though I knew each of these characters, and they all rang true. In addition, the author's style (always using full name each time a character is referred to) makes the story even more authentic. You will never look at anything green again without thinking of Serendipity Green. I may use the recipe and see if I can come up with the color!"
5,Levandoski weaves another Heartland gothic masterpiece!,"Levandoski has noisily dashed into the pantheon of great modern American novelists, manifest in his latest taking of the pulse of the Heartland. His characters are singularly striking, his dialogue is piquant and his narration drips with irreverent irony and delicious description. Levandoski is a genius!"
4,this book calms the waters of charismatic controversy,"As the author, I must admit that this book has worn well and stayed in print a long time. The testimonials I have heard are often pivotal in the lives of the readers. I feel rewarded."
5,"A tart, surprising character","In this small and tastefully-bound paperback, Terri Brown-Davidson has brought to vivid life the British painter Dora Carrington (1893-1932). Brown-Davidson's poetry is gritty and readable, the work arranged in monologues in Dora's voice. And what a subject Carrington makes: a self-described ""frigid"" artist who shares her bed with two or three men while truly loving only one, the writer Lytton Strachey, who--although he lives with her--happens to be homosexual. A tart, surprising woman born well before her time, Dora muses on such subjects as the damage wrought by her mother's obsessive-compulsive nature, her own lack of maternal instinct and of sexual desire (and how men are slaves to sex), her alienation in a community where she is viewed as a promiscuous oddball, and the death of her true love. It's a beautifully-written book about a refreshingly off-kilter character, well worth the read.Susan O'Neill..."
5,Remarkable and simply amazing...,"Terri Brown-Davidson's first full-length book of poetry is in no small measure a triumph for contemporary poets. Packed with intense imagery, compelling verse and a well-tuned ear for the sexual frustrations of Dora herself, this is a read not to missed by any serious poetry fan. From the first time you crack the binding till the last page, you're hurled into a world that is both luscious and revolting, a combination that keeps this reader begging for more.Brown-Davidson has created a place for the often wild and sex-crazed musings of the artist herself, giving the reader a taste of Carrington's mind and allowing us to know, if only for a moment, what it feels like to be stunningly brilliant and in love with one thing you cannot have. This journey is surreal and satisfying...worth several reads.If you're a reader looking to step out of your box and in search of something riveting and new, find this book and give it the attention it deserves."
4,Grassroots,Grassroots is a great movie. The cinematography is wonderful. It makes you want to move to Seattle or at least visit the city.
3,Great Vac with Significant Problem,"Couldn't ask for a better hand vac; however, it uses the VF08 replacement filter. I've searched for one high and low since I got this for Christmas, but they're not even available at the Black and Decker site. The lady at B&D just told me to keep calling and they'd have them eventually. I use this a lot, so I hope it's soon!"
1,poor design,"i have a battery Dyson downstairs and liked its power and convenience so i decided to put another hand vac upstairs. I didn't want to pay the Dyson price again so i thought the B&D; CHV 1568 A looked about right. Not. My issues with it are as follows.1. it'll chase little gravel nuggets all over but won't pick them up. For example, cleaning out the car floor mats... Dyson picks up everything ... the B&D; gets about 80 % and chases the rest.2. the on-off switch is so poorly designed that wet or slippery hands cannot operate it3. for ease of use the unit needs to be about 18 inches long to reach the floor. The B&D; has an extendable snout that does this but the snout has no detent and retracts during use ... what idiot thought that up4. yes, you could duct tape the snout out but then the unit won't fit on the charging station without modifying that as well.at that point i gave up and gave the unit away."
1,Looses Suction Immediately,"This looses suction as soon as a small amount of dirt gets into the filter. It's got a lot of power, but that doesn't help when the filter is clogged and it won't work. There are much better dustbusters out there, don't buy this one."
1,Don't waste the money,"Terrible battery life. After a year of use, the battery will not hold a charge at all. A TERRIBLE hand held. Whenever you hang the thing on the wall it points nose down and all the stuff simply falls out the end. One of these days, someone will make a handheld vacuum that has a good battery life or the battery is at least replaceable."
2,Cordless DustBuster hand vacuum,"This product is less useful than the 14 volt DustBuster that I replaced. the nozzle on the end of the device can be extended, but the nozzle is smaller than the 14 volt item."
4,Black & Decker CHV1568,This vacuum is as good as hand held vacuums get for under $75.00. My only concerns are the battery longevity and is Amazon a registered Black & Decker dealer that will process warranty claims. I read feedback on this unit from a few different sources and These people all had the same problems. They buy this to do big jobs with it and it doesn't work out for them very well. I use it for seconds at a time and this vacuum is the best one I have ever owned.
1,What a piece of junk!,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this model! But to be truthful, I haven't even had the chance to use it yet. Over the last 2 days I have had to buy 2 of them from Target (which I shouldn't have had to do since only the battery needed replacing, but doing that costs as much as a new model). In the first one, the black housing was separated, and I had to click it back together. There was also a large crack on the brush tool as well as a large chip on the dust bowl. I returned that one, thinking it must have been a fluke. With the second one, the unit would not sit in the charger properly so that the charging light would come on -- I had to wiggle it back and forth to get the light to come on, but it wouldn't stay lit. This is TERRIBLE quality control! These units are, of course, made in China, and we are getting TERRIBLE products from China! I have wasted three days of my time and $47.00 on this."
2,B&D Dustbusters,I just don't understand why Black & Decker got rid of the CHV 1400 dustbuster. I have one that's been working for 4 years now and love it. It seems like B&D wants to sell junk instead of sticking with a dustbuster that actually works great. It's like the Ever Ready bunny it keep going and going and going.
1,"Good at start, bad after 5 months","This item, a Black & Decker CHV1510 Dustbuster was shipped instead of the CHV1568 we ordered. We were told the CHV1568 was no longer available. The CHV1510 worked very well for about 5 months. After that it would not recharge sufficiently. The charge would last less than a minute when in use. We are throwing it out. Bought a Dirt Devil this time instead. So far, so good with that one."
1,Mine started to crackle and smoke :(,"I received this model from my mom as a gift. I thought, ""Wow, great! Black and Decker, a great brand."" It looks sharp and powerful. IT IS NOT.It began as an incredible disappointment when the suction started to get weak, which was pretty much after the first use. It turned out that the only way to improve it was to clean out the filter after just a few minutes of vacuuming. Even after realizing that was a way to improve it I just couldn't believe how poor of a product it was.The final use of this dustbuster started and ended with weird electrical crackling, smoke and subsequent burnt plastic/rubber/toxic-something smell.Unfortunately the money my Mom spent on this is went into the garbage along with the worthless vacuum.Time is extremely valuable and I do not want to be at the mercy of B&D; ""Customer Service"" so the only effort I'll put into this worthless piece of plastic is this review.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,Bad tools,The vac is built good and functions very well. It is a very good size for working in tight spaces. The crevice and brush tools are not designed well and the pull out extension doesn't lock in the extended posistion like it should.One use I wanted it for was to vacuum my car but it is only fair at doing that due to the poor design of the tools it has.
2,It was okay until...,"The suction was okay. I did have to clean the filter almost all the time. The battery last only 5-7 minutes or so, sometimes less. I wasn't very satisfied with it but I kept it for a while. Then all of a sudden, boom, it started making weird struggling noises and then completely broke down, just like that. I don't know what happened, but I am now shopping for another hand vac. I don't think I will buy black and decker agian."
4,DustBuster,"This little vacuum is handy to have. Although, I thought it might have had better suction, at least I had hoped so."
4,Most useful in evaluation the options of having someone else,"do the work.This is not a ""how to"" book as much as it is a ""consider the options"" book. The ""Consumer's Guide"" covers the basic home repair and improvement tasks, but offers beter insight into what these costs contracted versus do-it-yourself AND the relative difficulty level.For example, they examine different options for water heaters: gas and electric, tank and tankless, as well as heat pump. They note that gas heaters cost more to install, but you'll usually save the amount in the utility bill.They offer insight into add-on options. For example, an insulation jacket (for the above water heater) is worth considering if your exterior walls aren't well-insulated (<R7) or your heater is in a cold area."
2,Not true to ad,"The photo currently up shows the pack for sensitive skin (purple and white package), what arrived however was the one for normal skin (red and white packing). I had to send them back to the vendor. Beware"
2,Should have been limited to three,"This book poses some good arguments, but is tedious as a whole. Breese can only treat these individuals in a cursory fashion, where most of them have volumes written about individual facets of their lives and philosophies. To attempt a discussion about Darwin, Freud, Marx, Kierkegaard, Wellhausen, Dewey and Keynes (not to mention Einstein, whose ideas, Breese argues, gave birth to relativism) in a volume of this length is to create a good introduction, which I think this book accomplishes, but no more. Breese's style is at times witty and sharp, but the historical redundancy of his chapters and the brevity of the discussion on each individual leave something to be desired."
3,"Too Little Info Maybe Too Much ""Preach""","I think the book is short on actual info about each of the ""men."" It seemed to take so long to get to the meat of what each man theorized/proposed. The book is heavy on preaching which, normally I wouldn't mind, but that's not what I expected from this book. If you are looking for an easy to understand and concise book on the ""contributions"" of the men discussed, this may not be the best choice. You have to wade through alot of the author's opinions before you get to the few pages in each chapter that actually explain the ideas of each man covered here."
1,How many people can interpret Kierkegaard so badly?,"I have never read any who misinterprets Kierkegaard, one of the greatest Christian philosophers, so badly. He obviously took everything from Francis Schaffer, only he missed what little Schaffer got right. Horrendous book!"
2,Well written hogwash,"The reason for the two stars is the fact that this book is well written. Unfortunately most of the information contained within it is just a tired rehashing of all those old right wing demons (socialism, darwinism, psychology etc.) If God is as all powerful as people such as the author proclaim (and I for one believe He is) than why are they so scared of any philosophy that doesn't absolutely agree w/their personal belief system? Like most books of this nature, the choir will love it, the rest of us will pass."
1,Do not buy this book.,"Do not buy this book. It is an approach to christian fundementalism. It insists that all scientists are myopic and ignorant and that all theories are absolutley wrong no matter what, without any tests or expirements what so ever. The book clearly implies that evolution must be a lie, that the only truth is ""Jesus Christ"". That you should blindly put your faith in some God. The book also repeatedly quotes from the bible and offers no true insight on the seven men at all. Other than ""He's wrong"" and other of course, christin writtings. The author of the book is a baptist and by his writtings I see him as extremely dogmatic.Do not by books written by Christians if you are looking for truth. The truth shall set you free. This book doesn't even deserve one star. Remember, anyone can write a book. Don't believe everything you read. Alwayse ask questions."
5,Better than expected,I have wanted to read this book for several years and finely found the time.It has been more than I had hoped for.
3,Charming,"Light, no surprises, whiles away a plane ride, the ending out of character and a little rushed. As expected from this author"
3,A month later and still am waiting to receive it.,"Would love to be able to review this, but unfortunately it has been a month and still haven't received it. Did receive an e-mail stating it was coming from overseas -- maybe by rowboat!! My husband is very anxious so hope we won't have to wait much longer."
1,poor,"This is a very poor book on drilling techniques, JKD, or for that matter self-defense. I would not recommend this book to any one serious about JKD."
5,Night Angel 9,This is a GREAT book. A deffinate page turner. If you like real life drama you will LOVE this book. I highly recomend this book. I look forward to the next book in this series. Keep up the great work Peter!!!!
3,Not much on specifics.,"This book does cover a lot of subjects, but not in any depth. For a young hunter wannabe, maybe. For a young hunter that actually hunts, pretty skinny."
4,Sweet Bluegrass,"Alison Krauss has such an unbelievably soft and sweet voice that you could easily listen to her without any musical accompaniment. As a musician, her Fiddle playing is so tasty that you are amazed that so much talent comes in one package. Union Station is very good also, but it's Alison that makes everything work. When she harmonizes with herself on Lose Again, it's vocal perfection."
5,"Wonderful, bright, exciting sound","If you like bluegrass, or if you like a clean clear vocalist (like EmmyLou Harris) you will love Alison Krauss. Not a sour cut on the CD but ""Who Can Blame You"" is the leader. A real pick me up for rainy Seattle days."
4,Excellent CD,"I am a newcomer to Bluegrass - bought the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack and got hooked on it. I was intrigued by the Krauss songs on that album and came to Amazon looking for more. The reviews told me to buy this album, so I did. And I am quite pleased with the purchase.It is incredible to listen to such skill on the banjo, especially after hearing so much modern guitar strumming. That combined with Krauss' hypnotic voice make the album great. My only problem with the album was that Krauss didn't sing EVERY song!"
2,Not Their Best Effort,"I usually love Alison Krauss and Union Station, but not this album. Not ONE song on this album I enjoy...very odd. Don't waste your money. Get some of her or her and Union Station's earlier releases. Maybe they are coasting right now...smile."
2,No wonder it was on sale-,"The handset/cordless part seems to work just fine, however, the speakerphone on the base is terrible. Any time I use it people complain they can't hear me (even w/ the volume up) or the sound comes in and out. So I have to pick up the receiver every time. I'm bummed b/c it's the main reason I bought this phone. But if you don't care about the speaker feature you'll be in good shape."
1,Look elsewhere,"We have had this system for 3 years and am now shopping for a new system...one phone the number pads don't work, on another phone the menu buttons don't work."
4,Tells it like it is,Very interesting book. Makes you appreciate doctors for all they have gone through to get where they are.
4,Joe S,"This is a great book for non-medical people who want some insight into how a physician acquires and perfects his craft. Few people understand how specialists become what - and who - they are. This is an easy and entertaining read that avoids complex medical jargon and really sticks to the ""people"" side of the profession."
3,No editing or proofreading in Kindle version,"Skip the Kindle version and buy the paperback or hardback. The Kindle version is riddled with typos and (presumably) digital conversion errors. If I were the author, I would be appalled that my publisher deemed this acceptable. When I complained to Amazon, they suggested I send them a detailed list of all the errors. I bought the book for $9.99 and they would like me to do the proofreading as well? Although this is the worst book I have come across in terms of errors (I would never buy another digital book published by St. Martin's Press), other Kindle books are similarly poorly edited and much of my initial enthusiasm for this medium has been dampened by the poor quality."
2,Superficial and sappy,"While some of the medical discussions in this book are interesting reading, there is very little depth to most of the book. The parts of the book that are about Collins wife and the conversations with his colleagues are at times embarrassingly superficial. I was hoping to find something more like Atul Gawande's depth of analysis and thought about the medical profession. Read Gawande instead!"
1,Colors of iris do not match shadow iris plates,"I wasn't expecting much for $3, but I did expect the irises to be the same color as the irises in the shadow iris dish set and they are NOT!!!How does that happen? That is not sophisticated nor elegant as stated.Well, you buy cheap you get cheap, I guess."
3,Correlle spoon holder,"Plastic, could melt easily. Good pattern match but not great quality. Disappointing when arrived. Overpriced for plastic item. Not recommended ."
2,Looks are Deceiving...,"Unfortunately, this item is made of plastic and not the 'Corelle' type of dishware that the picture leads one to believe. Picture matches the dinnerware; but had I know it was just made of plastic I would not have bought (too expensive to send back)."
4,"listing is misleading, not 1500mah",Interstate Batteries said Amazon has the listing wrong. IB said they don't offer a 1500mah version. I found that out when I was sent a 2000mah version that is 1-2mm taller than my oem 1500mah. 2000mah barely fits in my Wahl beard trimmer.
5,Great read!,"Having lived 40 years with a criminal defense lawyer, I know plots. And this novel has a great one. I remember growing up in the '50's and putting my head on the desk to protect myself from an atom bomb. This novel takes me back to those days when Russia and the United States played ""mine is bigger than yours"" I'm definitely looking forward to the next Blish novel."
4,A adventurous summer read.,"I enjoyed reading The Taking of the King! I found the story compelling, and the characters well developed. It is apparent that the author has a great deal of knowledge about submarines and military life."
4,A page-turner under the sea,"Nelson Blish creates a vivid and detailed picture of life in a nuclear submarine, along with a page-turning adventure story as well. He has a witty and droll style that keeps the story moving. Recommend it highly."
2,"Sad, not even close to ""The Hunt For Red October""","The characters are two dimensional, the relationship shifts are inexplicable, and the story lacks cohesion and closure. Anti-climactic at best.Take a pass."
5,Great for those who care about this type of thing,"I just finished Heath's book and found it to be extremely fascinating and well thought out. The problem is, I can't imagine many people who wouldn't find the title a little intimidating.I am an economics PHD student at UC Irvine, with special interests in critical theory, so I found it useful. The book is esentially an argument against instrumental rationality, especially that used by game theorists, using Habermas' theory of communicative action. If you don't know what all of those words mean in that last sentence but want to learn, then this book is great. If you do know what all of those words mean, you should definitely get this book."
5,Body Art,This is a great video I just bought it and love it. I have done this workout a couple of times and already can see some results. I would highly recomend this video if you want a great toned body
5,Perfect,Great customer service.Product as described and technical help was very professional. Was able to talk with someone when i had a question. Very nice people. Highly recommend this store.
3,A Good Collection,"I ordered this Burt Lancaster set primarily for Jim Thorpe - All American which I'd seen as a kid and it truly holds up well. Surprisingly, Executive Action turned out to be a fascinating look at the JFK assassination made in the 1970s before Oliver Stone's JFK and I liked it even better than JFK. My third favorite was The Flame and the Arrow, with Burt at his hammiest and athletic best; a very entertaining film. His Majesty O'Keefe and South Sea Woman were lesser films but entertaining none the less. A pretty good bargain I thought."
5,Burt Lancaster signiture collection,Burt Lancaster has to be one of the most underrated actors ever to make movies. This is a good collection. Executive Action (not much Lancaster in the movie) and The Flame and the Arrow are worth the price of the collection. All the movies are excellent picture and sound. A real bargain at the price.
2,"again, you can never go home again","It was a series of Burt Landcaster old movies. Some really old, so old that a lot of the movies didn't make much sense. We saw two of the oldies, and haven't looked at any of the othersAgain, you can never go home again."
1,What a Piece of Crap!,This thing is a piece of crap! It is over rated and can move only in one direction. ounce it hits a wall it stopps and you have to turn it around. This is a crappy product
2,Disappointed,"After hearing that Tekno was amazingly like a real puppy, I got one for my 6 and 11 year old boys. We knew we were in trouble when we tried to get it out of the packaging, which required the removal of several screws (Why did they do that???). Once out, we discovered the limitations which make it nothing like a real dog. It can only walk in a straight line, can only stand, can not run, and the 'tricks' involve flashing lights and electronic voices (it can not roll over, sit, or any other 'typical' dog tricks). The kids played with it the first day, and it's been off since."
1,Absolute piece of junk,"This toy looks really cute, but it can't even walk! It takes about one-and-a-half steps and then falls over! You would at least expect it to be able to walk a little bit, but it just falls over and lays on its side moving its feet back and forth and barking. Like I said it looks cute with his light up eyes and such, but this toy is an absolute piece of junk! Don't waste your money like I did!"
3,Look before you buy Tekno.,"Just a few words of warning to those about to purchase Tekno online: go see one in person before you buy it. I went to Kmart today and looked at Tekno. He is cute but I don't think I'll get it. They had 4 boxes on the shelf. One of them had obviously been opened and/or returned. There is a demo button on the box that you can push on Tekno to make him bark and move. The opened one didn't work at all. The other 3 worked but all worked differently. Some barked right away, one the tail wagged really fast, others were slow and erratic. I tried them several times but they didn't impress me. It just didn't look very well made. If you're thinking about getting this I would suggest looking in person or you may be dissapointed like I was."
1,No fun with Tekno,"To get Tekno to do his advanced tricks was so complacated I (Mom) gave up. My daughter quit playing with him within the first 24 hours because she couldn't get him to do the tricks. His legs also went ""out of whack"" almost immediately. He'd take one step and then fall over. We returned him."
2,CUTE BUT BORING,WE BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR OUR SON. AFTER TRYING TO TEACH HIM HIS TRICKS WITHOUT LOSING THOSE ALREADY TAUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH TROUBLE. LOST HIS APPEAL ATER 3 DAYS AT THE MOST. IT NOW SITS ON HIS COMPUTER DESK COLLECTING DUST. IF THEY WANT THIS TO BE ENJOYABLE AND LIFE LIKE AS POSSIBLE THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THIS PRODUCT.
2,Huge disappointment,"This thing is so overrated. I was expecting something a little more fun and intellectual than this. It's a plastic toy that plays music on command, farts/burps on command and says ""excuse me"" (????), and it does several other meaningless ""tricks"" (as they call them). The programming is dumb. It's just pushing the buttons they tell you to push. That's not programming. That's just following directions. It's supposed to act like a dog, but it speaks words more than dog sounds. Don't buy this piece of garbage. It's not worth (it) at all.This is nothing more than a plastic toy with flashing lights and music. In any other form, you wouldn't consider paying for this. Don't let another holiday ""gotta have it"" marketing campaign convince you that it's worth it. Move on to something else."
5,What a Pup!,"This puppy is a wonderful toy for kids of all ages. I've heard and read so many mixed reviews on him...but then it appears that those who are negative expect more than just a toy. That is all Tekno is...A TOY! Yeah, it is frustrating getting it out of the box....but that is the box...not the pup. My children are having a ton of fun with Tekno. It's a riot watching them play with him....it is almost like having a dog without the work!"
2,ANNOYING,"TEKNO IS NOT VERY DURABLE. MY 4 YEAR OLD BROKE HIS BACK LEG THE FIRST DAY OF USE, THE DOG DOESN'T WALK WITHOUT A STUTTER OR AT ALL NOW. TO MAKE THE DOG DO ANY OF THE TRICKS YOU MUST PUSH 3-5 OF THE SENSORS AND I CAN BARELY REMEMBER THE COMBINATIONS LET ALONE TEACH A 4 YEAR OLD. I BOUGHT MINE WHEN THEY WERE $50, I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU REALLY WANT ONE FOR YOUR KIDS TO WAIT FOR A SALE. AND DON'T THINK OF IT AS A TOY INVESTMENT."
5,Fun Robot Dog,This robotic dog is very cute. He does quite a bit of tricks and walks. He is very fun to play with too. He evan snores and goes to sleep. Just dodn't make loud noises or he'll wake up. The only thing is that the batteries go dead really fast. But otherwise he's a great toy. He is a great price also. ...So nows the time to get him. Enjoy!
3,just so you should know,at the begining i was so happy that my parents got it for meso i set the time and taught it the tricks that the box said it could do and i was so happy in the first two weks and then it started to get annoying it barked and i could not get the buttons right it just fustrated me if there is not an adult with the child when he or she playing with it then forget it...
5,Sweet Little Puppy,"He is wonderful with my 8-year old granddaughter. The only problem I am having is after a day, he will not wag his tail or walk. Is anyone else having the same problem? I've e-mailed Teckno and am awaiting a response. Other than that, he is wonderful."
2,Not Man's Best Friend,"Tekno looks better on TV than in real life. Getting him out of the box is the first of several major challenges. He's wired in so tightly in his futuristic box that you'll need wire cutters AND a screwdriver (to remove 6 different screws) to get him out ---a 20 minute project! Finding the instructions was a stroke of luck, since they're up under the lid in a secret spot. Then, learning all the commands (especially teaching them to a 5 yr old who can't read) is nearly IMPOSSIBLE. Moving parts haven't broken yet, but there are several that look fragile. Nothing warm and friendly about this puppy. Save your money...this one is destined for the little toy graveyard. (Who thinks up these goofy toys, anyway?)"
1,Borrring,"I bought this toy for my six-year old daughter. She and her three-year old brother and two-year-old sister tired of it almost immediately. It is boring and tedious. It mostly just stumbles around blindly and barks annoyingly. It does seem to be pretty durable, though. I suspect that there are much better toys out there, for the money. I would wait a few years for the robotic toys to improve"
3,"Cute, but boring","We got Tekno for my sister's birthday, because she thought these electronic dogs were really cool. Well, as it turns out, Tekno isn't as cool as he sounds. He's really cute and everything when you first get him, but then he gets kinda boring. He's still fun to show to my friends and stuff, but we mostly keep him on the off button. I suggest you get this if you want a toy dog, but if you want a fake dog that acts like a real one, I think that you should get one of the more expensive kinds!"
1,"If you are not a kid, not much fun","I played with him about 1/2 an hour. The instructions are a little confusing. His tricks are not that neat. He only walks straight until he hits something. No turning ability, sitting ability. I was hoping for a truly interactive dog that could do cool tricks and entertain my friends and me. People will come over and play with the dog a little while, but they will get bored after a hour or so.I can imagine little kids getting sick of Tekno pretty quickly. ... is not much to spend on a toy, but I would imagine that for children there is stuff more fun to play with and more educational.Now I have to figure out what to do to get rid of the dog so it is not a waste. I think I will give it to my little cousins. Maybe they can get a couple of hours of play out of Tekno. Also, mine did NOT come with 4 AA batteries."
3,Tough! Toy!,"Can't imagine, that this toy would stand-up to the roughest conditions! Everytime it falls of the staircase, it doesn't seem to have any wear'n'tear on it... ""Two-Thumbs up!"""
1,need to change age recommendation,"We got 2 of these for our 5 year old twins. They are too complicated for a 5 year old and not much fun for them. The age needs to be more like 7 and above. Fortunately, they haven't gotten broken yet so maybe they'll still work in a couple of years and then we'll get more use out of them. It was also the most ridiculously difficult thing I ever had to take out of the box!"
3,It was ok,"I got this dog from my mom for christmas 2001. I'm not dissapointed exactley, but it wasn't what I expected. I got the dalmation, which, in my opinion, is much cuter than the silverish one, and it was more comical than hard to get it out of the box. Mom and I kept trying to get it out, but it was seriously strapped in, and it kept on trying to walk and was making these weird grinding sounds. Than, when I finaaly got it out, I set it, and it was pretty cool. I didn't like the burping sounds, or when it talked, so I unprogramed that, but then it was pretty fun. For a while. But it was really stupid. It walked into a wall and didn't move for three hours. It was sort of annoying, constantly crying if you weren't patting it all the time, and if anyone made any noise, it would start barking and walking. And I didn't like the way it could only walk straight. I finally turned it off a couple days after christmas, and haven't turned it on since. But it was an ok gift. It was pretty cool, overall."
4,Child's Play,"Tekno dogs are fun toys for children of the right age and maturity. (Most three to five years old need toys that are more durable than Tekno. However, a six year old, or older child, is likely to love Tekno.)I bought Tekno for my 6 yr. old nephew. He adores it! And aside from his enjoyment he is learning patience as he ""programs"" Tekno and fulfills the robot dog's needs. My nephew has even gone so far as to make a collar for Tekno, and his imagination continue to thrive with new ideas.Granted, Tekno does not walk backward and has generally been exaggerated regarding his programming and features, but kids enjoy Tekno. Kids thrive on things that need/want them as much as they need/want them. While Tekno won't prepare a child 100% for a reall dog that needs morning walks, vet visits, and the like, it's a step forward.Tekno is for ""child's play"". It seems like it's the adults who are the harsh critics."
5,Kelly's point of view on Teksta!,"I think personnaly,Teksta is a very fun toy which keeps u occupied when your bored.Your recessing how well you can look after something without making any mistakeable or wrong moves.I think this would be a great toy for a christmas or birthday present and all kids including myself would want such a delightful toy."
3,"Can some one tell me ""Who let the dog out!""",Man I cant believe what a pain it was to take this toy out of its box and i have the patience of a saint. it comes in a nice box with a carrying handle. when i tried to open it I couldnt figure out how after a while the only way to liberate this dog from his prison was to destroy the box it had tie fastners and it was screwed into place on a base. What a waste of materials(if your an enviromentalist you'll caringe at the excess waste this toy produces) the box was no more I was hoping it would be a storage device for the toy ...was i wrong. A little kid would probably have a fit trying to get this thing out. After about half hour of freeing the toy the robot was kinda cool and playing with it for about 10 minutes the toy got anoyingand now it sits on a shelf in it off position. remember if you get this toy get a long screwdriver. I'm hoping i-cybie turns out to be better.
3,It's ok,this toy is not bad. But do not expect it to learn or be like the Sony Aibo. You get what you pay for.
2,it stinks,"Tekno is not that fun. All he does is walk and bark. It is not very durable. My sister got mad and threw Tekno a very short distance (about six inches), and it stopped working correctly."
3,Be careful with young children and Tekno,"I purchased this toy for our almost-four year old son, and although he likes it, it has pinched his fingers three times in the leg areas while it was walking and he tried to pick it up. I would recomend it for older children that have large enough hands to pick it up without getting their fingers caught. I am returning it because he is now afraid to pick it up."
4,TEKNO is fun !!!!!!!!,"Tekno got here really fast. He was here in four days after I ordered it. When it got here I ripped open the box and took out Tekno turned him (off) and read through the manual. Some of his tricks are kind of loud but most of them are fun. It exercises your memory and reading skills to read and remember all those tricks so it's pretty educational. it ran off my chair a few times and didn't brake, concidering it's plastic. I think the only bad thing about it is having to open the box which I was about to get a sledge hammer out and see if I could brake it open. This definetly is a great toy. my mom said the thing thats good about that dog is that it doesn't stink and you don't need to clean up after it.Yours truly Harrison"
4,Very Fun,"Tekno is a wonderful toy! I got one over the weekend and I can't put her down for long. If you want something educational this isn't the toy, but if you just want a playmate, it's perfect. Though I was disappointed that Tekno can't sit, lay, or move in any direction other than forward.Other than these things and that Tekno barks constantly I am very satisfied. Tekno even barked when my dad walked in the front door!"
4,mixed bag,"This is a fun toy, but I think the age rating is off. It is quite complicated for a five-year-old, especially if you want to program it to do anything. I think unpacking it was perhaps the biggest challenge, though; they have to include a screwdriver just to get it out of the box and functioning! It seems like an amusing toy once you get the hang of it, but its responses to commands seem to be somewhat undependable, and its English words are almost impossible to understand. But my nephew still thought it was pretty fun, at least when he first got it. We'll see if it lasts."
3,I love the off switch,"Tekno is really cute. Some of the thing that he does makes us laugh but he is really needy like a gigapet. The commands are too much. There is no way I will learn all of the combinations. When he is on, all he does is yap so I really like the off button. Plus it took just 3 days to break off the ear."
3,This toy is pretty cool for a while then it gets boring!!!,I have all the other Tekno's and I think that there is a variety of different Tekno's. Especially after Tekno 2.0 came out. Tekno can be a good companion. (...) All the Tekno toys are pretty durable with snap off legs and all. I liked the card trick tekno does he tells you what card you are pointing at. I know its easy for humans to do that but for a robot its pretty cool. One of the things I did not like was it always kept bumping in to things instead of walking around them and it cant turn. But over all I think it is a pretty good product.(...)But any way I think Tekno is a pretty good buy. Although it is not half as good as i-cybie or any of those expensive ones it is good for a starter. because it is not to expensive. (...)
2,Tekno the disapointment.,I bought Tekno with some Christmas money. It was pretty neat. THen it got kinda boring. It would not walk. I changed it for a new one. It was fine. Then it would not STOP WALKING! Tekno is a big disapointment and to expensive.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"TEKNO IS ANOTHER TOY THAT WILL END UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TOY BOX UNTOUCHED AFTER A WEEK. IT ALMOST REMINDS ME OF A FURBY. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! I RETURNED MINE TO THE STORE AFTER I TRIED IT OUT MYSELF. GLAD I DID, BECUASE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST HYPED ""STUPID"" TOYS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! IT IS EXTREMLY ANNOYING AND NON EDUCATIONAL."
2,Let down,"Hi. I was really let down by this ""dog"". I did a lot of research before I bought two of them and was really excited about x-mas morning. We could not get him to stop walking for more than 2 seconds. His programming is disgusting. ... when he talks it scares you, his voice is so strange. The kids ended up having their dogs race each other down the hallway because all they could get him to do was walk forward. I guess I was hoping that the dogs could sit and maybe turn a corner toward your voice. They also do not recognize only their owners voice, everything they do is a series of button pushing. I would not waste your money!!"
1,Tekno the ... robotic puppy!,"Tekno is definetly over rated! In fact it['s bad]! When you pat it your actually pushing down a button and almost every time it does the same thing. It barks and wags it's tail. When it walks it almost falls over and it makes a stupid noise. You don't even need it's bone to feed it, you just have to push down on his mouth sensor button! This toy stinks! I'm going to get my money back next week. If you actually want a cool toy, buy a Razor scooter!"
4,REAL FUN TOY FOR EVEN YOUR DOG! IVE HAD IT FOR A WHILE!,"Hi! I've had this toy for about a year now and I love it! At first it was great and then I stopped playing with it (I don't know why) and then I took it out today to play with it and I had so much fun! My dog played with it, too and loved it! She can't wait to play with it again! It's like her playmate! It's a geat toy to me. That's my opinion. Some people don't like this toy and some do! I can't promise you that you will like it, because not all people do. But I am one of the people that do! I hope you find this review helpful! Buh-Bye!"
4,all hail tekno,"ok... maybe not all hail tekno...he's not that educational, actually, he teaches manners, my making an electronic burp, then ""whoops!"" or ""'cuse me"", and when you feed him, he can say, ""thanks!"" but you have to teach him to do that. It's very easy to follow the instruction manual, except getting it out was pretty hard...you might want to have pliers and a screw driver around...otherwise he's great! You can teach him a card trick, make him dance..(not like poo-chi, but his own cool way)he sniffs, he begs, he sleeps, we wags his tail, flaps his ears, and he grows like a real puppy!"
1,its way cool for the first hour and then...,"okay when u get this toy its just like getting a real puppy. youre all excited...! so after about an hour or two of playing with it and tripping out on how 'new millineum' you truly are, well, lets just say tekno is limited. apparently it does dozens of tricks, but after figuring out 2 or 3 of them, you wont want to bother. and it tends to get stuck in corners! now my tekno happily sits on my living room table, turned OFF, staring at the wall. the one lasting thing about this toy is when friends come over they will dig on it just like you did when you first got it, then they will be bored by it and stop coming over to visit you."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"My son had saved enough in his piggy bank to buy Tekno. However we had to return him twice because after about 2 days, he just stopped working. The instructions don't help and the web-site is a complete waste of time. He never did any of the card tricks advertised as well. And for all you parents out there, if you insist on buying this product, take it out of the box BEFORE Christmas Day. It took us a total of 20 minutes to get the blasted thing out. It is not only tied on (like most toys these days) to the box but also screwed onto a base. Save yourself some grief and open it before the big day. But just do yourself a favor and don't buy it at all. 'Nuff said."
3,Something better for the younger crowd...,"Tekno puppy is a fun, educational toy for children that are old enough to program it and watch their fingers(picking it up while it is moving it's legs can pinch!) Mega-Byte the Hound Droid, ... is much better for younger ones (older kids will enjoy it too). The remote control teaches coordination. He's bigger than tekno puppy and no 'pinching' parts. He has a space in his back for small 'valuables' and can be set to guard these items. Mega-Byte is also more cost-efficient."
2,Tekno the robotic dog,"I had bought this toy for my younger brothers, to who I am writing this review for the eldest one, expecting what I had read about the toy. I excepected for the dog to behave just like a real dog. It says it barks at loud noises like a real dog. I found it barking non stop even when it was quiet. It also had said it walks like a real dog. It did not. It would topple over and would not turn, walk backwards, or sit just like a dog does. And for durability it's legs popped off almost as soon as I put it down to test out what I read in the instruction booklet and soon followed was it's ear. But I do admit it is much better than poo chi and is more reasonably priced than aibo and many other kind of robot toy dogs. Just don't expect a hi tech ""dog of the future"" robot dog."
2,obsolete and missing code,"only covers servlet 2.1 spec and jsp 1.0 spec. in addition, the code for the connection pool is missing a class(RefreshThread) and an interface(Refreshable). if anyone knows where this code resides please send e-mail to joe.gatta@lmco.com thanks."
4,when will amazon get it?,"what will it take to convince Amazon that they MUST provide the date the original recording was made, NOT the date the transfer to CD was done?Tha later info. is basically worthless, the former essential to anyone at all knowlegeable and interested in the artist and the recording.Amazon get with it."
1,Radio controlled watches from third party supplier.,"I refused delivery on this watch. This was the third radio controlled watch that I ordered. I could not get the either one of the first two watches previosly ordered to work properly. I ended up paying the freight for the return of both watches, and did'nt want to take a chance with the third one, so I refused delivery. From now on I will not order from a third party supplier of Amazon. It makes me suspicious of the quality when not purchased directly from Amazon."
2,Not as good as they say it is...,"I have bought this device on july 2005 with the idea of saving my favorite shows from my satelite TV. Well, that is not possible with this device, you have to capture to a PC first and then burn the DVD. If that's ok with you, you are clear so far.Now, there is no way to run the included software if you have Windows Media Player 10 or later. On the device specifications you find that you need WMP 7 or later, well, I had 10 and it didn't work, on their support page they suggest you to downgrade to v9, if that's ok with you, you are clear.So, I haven't been able to use it yet, not for tv capture or to record my MiniDV tapes into a DVD.If you can wait, wait for a better version, perhaps one that works smoother."
1,"Nice title, but...","...falls short of delivering. First, the book does not cover creative thinking, or creative greatness. You better look for other great books on building creative thinking like ""Cracking Creativity"". Second, every page confirms the writer's background of a lawyer. While thinking, especially the unthinkable is undeniably very important in the court, the writer is kind of trapped in a ""black/white"" world. True vs. lie with topics such as ""concentrate on crucial facts"" or ""always make sure.."". Well, that might work in the court, but helps one little in thinking out of the box / thinking creatively. Thus, worst rating possible."
3,Not What is Expected,"This is a textbook. It is readable and interesting, full of stories and examples. But it won't really help you on your quest to think more creatively. No real strategies for that."
1,"Reply for ""GOOD, BUT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER""","(Don't get offended by the rating, I had to put one so I could post the topic) I see what you're saying, but I've read this on an Internet site, and I'll post the link when I can find it. I was just looking for the RE books and I came across one RE book that was in another language. When I translated it, it was in German, and it roughly translated into, if I recall right, ""Gate to the Underworld"" or something along that line, so just be patient, Mrs. Perry just might translate it and bring it into the English version soon."
3,DOES NOT INCLUDE FONT ALPHABETS!,"Beautifully packaged fold out set with work book and tools and a guidebook with great photos and ideas. Heidi's writing style is beautiful, and I would love to write in the fonts that she shows throughout her book, but sadly it is missing any complete alphabet examples to copy/practise with. If you hate your handwriting, as most of us do, then this book will dangle a carrot of beautiful writing examples, give excellent reasons WHY your handwriting is unique and important, but still leave you hating your own handwriting unless you can find some complete alphabet fonts to try out and develop a style that you are happy with using in your handwritten journaling. I would rate the whole package very highly, EXCEPT FOR it lacking the one essential item that could have made it a PERFECT purchase!!! So a 5 star presentation with a 3 star satisfaction overall!"
2,Disappointing,"Bought this book online on clearance elsewhere, and regret spending even those few dollars on it.It's a cute, feel-good guide to practicing and improving your own handwriting so that you feel more confident about it. It's NOT a guide on how to write in Heidi Swapp's style or any other style but your own.I knew that from the title, so that isn't the problem. It just doesn't grab me or inspire me to use it. It's too school-girlish.I tried using it a couple of times, was bored and now it just sits on my shelf. I've had more fun and inspiration just doodling on my own. Will try to sell it at my next rummage sale or donate it to my local library.If you want guided practice with your own handwriting with lots of positive encouragement from afar, then get it if you can find it on sale cheap. It probably won't be worth the full price to most people."
3,not up to the hype,"I guess I just don't HATE my handwriting. The only thing I got from this book was WRITE IN PENCIL FIRST! She really is just teaching you to work with your current handwriting, so practice ... THE END!"
4,love my handwriting,well i really liked this book. heidi writes as if you is there with you teaching you her techniques. i've had this book for a while now. and i still find it a useful referance when i need help developing a hand font for my pages.
1,bad customer service,"I did not buy this exact model, but I did by an ingersoll rand based on their name. The machine has had problems, that sometimes happens, the real problem is getting someone to fix the problems. The customer service at the distribution and repair center is terrible. I would never pay the extra money fr an ingersoll., you can get a better deal with other products and get customer service too."
3,Reggie's Left,"I disagree with the review below. Reggie is not right, Reggie is left. But still listen to him. KHOW 3-7PM."
1,Head injury?,"Did reggie rivers suffer from a head injury during football practice? His writing is amatuerish and boring. Do we really need another book by a washed up athlete? What's next, mysteries by OJ?"
5,One of the best.,Great two sessions from early 1958 with perfect production by great Orrin Keepnews. From his artistic peak with his legendary trio. With Till There Was You which plays Beatles some years after and great The Freedom Suite I feel like the band is playing in my room. Must for every jazz fans.
1,Label VERY Misleading,"This label is very misleading. The pills are not 1000mg each as it seems to say. Instead, it is 1000mg per serving which is 3 tabs so if you are looking for a decent price, this is NOT it. I will never buy their products again."
4,Pimsleur conversational English for Spanish Speakers.,"This was a gift for someone living and teaching in Mexico. He really wanted it, had heard it was great."
2,Atomic Watch review,"works well, but scratches easily. advertised as scratch-resistant but it manages to show every scratch it comes across."
4,Falco Travels Again,"In this one, Falco travels to North Africa. While a good read, I like the stories better that take place when Falco is in Rome."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Not a popular man.Not one of the better Falco books, this one. Marcus Didius still needs the cash to get himself promoted in rank in Roman society and make his relationship with Helena seemly, so to speak. As such, he stoops to tax collecting, but his investigative skills are put to more work with killings at some gladiator schools.Helena's scarpered brother and woman also give his family a headache, in the process."
4,Good Read,"I'll be honest - I actually had to buy this for a class in Western Culture and it was required reading. I had never heard of Lindsey Davis or Marcus Didius Falco. But because I am such an avid reader, I took the time and read the whole thing. I was surprised and I finished it quickly. The characters are likable and easy to identify with. The plot is very well thought out and ancient Rome sounds like a fun place to be solving mysteries. Maybe the historical aspects aren't as realistic as they could be, but Two For The Lions was still a good read and prompted me to go to the library and check out another - ""Three Hands in the Fountain"". As far as mystery novels go, it's fun to read on the beach or in the park in the summer."
3,Aileens Opinion,Pretty little thing - but sometimes phone turns off in case -Good value for the money
3,Not big enough,"The basketball portion of this combo set is pretty good. We have a ton of fun playing tackle basketball in the pool.The volleyball net is another story. It said it would fit a 30ft round pool....Not even close. The string that is attach to the net came off as soon as we tried to pull it tight. The top string is supposed to get tied around the poles. The bottom string is supposed to be anchored to the ground. The pole came out of the bracket everytime we tried to tie the other end. My husband was finally able to tie one end to our fence and the other end to the pole. He's eventually just going to put posts in the ground with hooks or something and not even use the poles that came with it. It will be a lot easier, we think, to do it that way rather than struggle to try keep the posts in and have to tie it off to the fence."
3,A Gift Idea,"I bought the wallet in error.It is a well made item, however it is not a style that I like. I don't care to fold bills in half.I like a true bi or tri-fold.This wallet will become a nice gift for someone."
3,Well...let's just say I like her short pieces better...,"NPR is Bailey White's home, and this novel, full of eccentric oddballs with a thin story line, makes me think she should stick to those short schticks in the future. Good characterization, especially Roger, a plant pathologist and peanut virologist who may or may not be falling in love with Della, a bird artist.White's gentle humor and affection for life's slightly weird travelers makes this a fun read."
1,Quite a Lemon,"Not what I hoped for; certainly not what I expected from the glowing reviews, nor from my previous experiences with Ms. White's writing. The characters are confusing to sort out (any non-Russian novel which begins with a character list should immediately be suspect), not simply because of their sound-alike names but because they are all so equally flat that no one character ever distinguishes itself from another in the reader's mind. Ms. White is a superior essayist, and unfortunately, has written this novel as if it, too, were a series of essays. No character development, no plot to speak of and no one to care about by the end of the book. Quite a Year For Plums is a lemon."
1,God I hated this book,"I amazed myself at my powerful dislike of this book. Half way through it I felt like I was Waiting for Godot. Or just waiting for SOMETHING to happen.This book begins with a list of characters. This is always a red flag to me that I am about to embark on a journey with an author who didn't bother to take the time to develop characters compelling enough so that I wouldn't HAVE to keep turning back to the list to figure out who I was reading about. I find them completely distracting and a major cop-out on the part of the author. In QUITE A YEAR FOR PLUMS, the list consists of grumpy old women and the men unfortunate enough to inhabit their lives. This was a book club selection and had it not been for my comittment to the group, I would have thrown this book in the trash before completing the first chapter...."
2,"Boring, lifeless, characters without a plot","This book is just a collection of everyday, ordinary events that weren't tied together in any cohesive fashion. The author described behavior of the characters but never portrayed any insight into their motivations and emotions. Better luck on your next novel, Ms. White."
1,National Treasure or National Bore,"Because of all the hoopla by Amazon.com and others for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I'm sorry, but I just don't see it. I read a great deal. I teach literature. The characters in this book, however, left me cold. They were not as eccentric or amusing as those in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I simply could not care about them. The plot was also absent, or so deeply buried that it never surfaced.I am really sorry that I spent my money on White's latest effort. She may be called a ""National Treasure"" by some, but I'll now regard her as the ""National Bore."""
3,not excellent but still good reading,quite a year for plums is not flawless like bailey whites short stories but still a good read. she captures the qualities of southern life that prove the south has risen again.
5,Brilliant reading for anyone with a brain & sense of irony & above average smart humor!!!,"First ""read"" as a book n tape on the road this inspired me to laugh and revel in subtle brainiac humor. AND it sure made driving down, down, down Interstate 95 meaningful. So real and so profund and so damn funny, as an over read over schooled sarcastic nerd cum grown up, I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable listen/read. What a cheering up hoot!!"
3,"An enjoyable, comfortable read, perfect for a hot summer day","I have to say this book didn't meet expectations, but it was still a great read. I could just hear Bailey White's distinctive voice narrating the lives of these characters. The text is rich with classic Bailey White one-liners, if you read it carefully. I suspect that her voice adds so much to her audio narratives that we feel something is missing when we read her stories on paper."
1,Sleeper,"I have enjoyed selected stories from Mama Makes up Her Mind for years. I was excieted to see that Ms. White had written a novel and bought it immediately. I understand life in small southern towns, they have been the essence of my experience, but I did not find these people to be quaint or interesting or worth reading about. By page 38 I had a real lack of interest into these characters and there was no plot that I could detect. I usually know a story when I see one and this book was a disappointment."
1,Novel? NO! Memoir? Maybe. ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT!!!,"The front of the book clearly states, ""a novel,"" but I'm afraid that statement was as much of a bold faced lie as all of the glowing reviews on the back of the book. While White's writing style is undeniably entertaining, it's going to take more than that to consider this book a novel. A novel has a set-up, a conflict, and a resolution, right? We all learned that in English class, I think. For that reason I was EXTREMELY disappointed to reach the end of this ""novel"" feeling like someone must have cut about four chapters out of the middle of the book without my knowing it. And do I care enough about any of the characters to reread it and find out for sure? Not a chance! If you are from the South and would like to read this book simply to muse about the preferences and surroundings you may have in common with these very elusive characters, go for it. But please don't recommend this book to anyone under the literary title of ""novel."""
1,What did everyone else SEE in this book?,"Sorry folks, but this book was a real loser. Perhaps it's just that I like plots that make sense, can't stand it when the author gives most of the characters names that start with the same sound, or that I literally had to force myself to finish it ---- but, I really did not like this book and regretted having spent the money to purchase it. I read a lot, and read a great variety of topics, but this one was a total wash!"
1,Ho Hum,This is my first exposure to Bailey White and after having read some of the other reviews of this book I am inclined to try her one more time. It couldn't get worse. The lack of plot was disturbing. She was going nowhere and was getting there. So many characters and for what? Slow and plodding with periodic tangents. There was no meat to this book. I was so glad it was over and honestly I didn't care if Roger ever did fall in love again. What a letdown.
1,"Boring, Unless You're Into Birds & Chickens","I really hate to write a bad review about a book, because I'm sure this book might appeal to someone. It just didn't appeal to me. In fact, I couldn't make myself read the entire book. I was soooo confused with the characters, I just felt lost most of the time. Although, the parts about the woman who thought aliens were drawn to her letter combinations was amusing. And I just did not get the ""celebrity"" status of the peanut man who every woman in town just felt obliged to protect from other ""preying"" women; in a big sister-like fashion. I guess I'm just weird!"
3,Very odd,"I don't really know what to say about this book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. As a matter of fact, it wasn't really a book. No plot, no climax, no resolution, no nothing. The humor is quite blah. It reads more like a play if you ask me. The characters were very quirky and eccentric, but I felt Ms. White could have made them funnier. Their qualities were hilarious, but she never talked much about them, just let us know they existed. I am only keeping this book because I like the cover."
4,I feel as if I grew up with these people.,"I listened to this book on tape as I drove to and from school. I laughed out loud several times when the characters reminded me of people I knew as a child in rural southern Virginia. Hilma, Eula, Meade and even Louise could have been my great-aunts. I wish we could all have a friend like Roger. The agricultural references as well as those related to birds and floriculture were educational, helped to set the scene, and marked the passage of time. I loved the sound of Ms. White's voice. This was a great book to ""read"" on the road, though sometimes my vision was blurred by a few tears. It relaxed me after teaching all day"
2,Quite a Year for Plums,"Yikes...what a confusing, unsatisfying book. I had to keep looking at the list of characters the author supplied in the front of the book to keep everyone straight. For a book this short and lackluster, another fifty characters wouldn't help. Off to the free book bin at the library with this one."
3,Started out funny and then...stopped,"When I started reading it, I kept thinking that I had found a writer I could read again and again. After page 143, I knew I couldn't finish this book unless someone put a gun to my head. The contrast between the beginning and the middle was not dramatic, there just wasn't one. The puns stopped being ""punny"" because we had read them too many times and the story started to drag and become dull like dish water. The characters were quirky, but nothing happened in the book and the lack of a plotline couldn't hold my interest in the quirky characters. We get to know a lot about Georgia and chickens and birds and forests and peanuts and oscillating fans and... But information does not make up for the snapshot this book is. Instead of moving along, it stays static."
1,Disappointing,"Although I normally enjoy Bailey White's books, I couldn't even finish this one. The characters were not developed enough to keep an interest in them. The things that the characters were interested in were boring. There was really no definitive plot line and the chapters were almost short stories themselves, with little or no connection to succeeding ones. It was hard to want to continue reading this book because I could not make a connection to the people involved or to the story."
1,What was this book about?,"The descriptions of the characters were enough to pique my interest, but not clear enough to remember from one reading session to another who was who. Now that we know a little about each person, could we please have a plot? This gentle novel was a bit too gentle for my taste."
1,Go elsewhere for a good read,"Based on my enjoyment of Ms. White's essays of NPR and some favorable press I selected this book for our book club to read. What a mistake! It isn't about anything. There is no plot! There is no story! The characters are paper thin and there is no reason to care about any of them. You will be glad to learn, however, that the author apparently spends a good deal of time at state agricultural conferences. I found nothing to like but I guess I'm just one of the city slickers she rather lamely pokes fun at..."
5,Genius Within,"If you're already looking at this page you don't need me to tell you about Glenn Gould. This was a beautifully-filmed, well-done documentary that will, hopefully, introduce Gould's genius (and eccentricities) to a new generation of fans. And, of course, the soundtrack speaks for itself. :) If you missed its limited theatrical release, buy the DVD; you won't be disappointed."
5,Travel video,"Purchased this and about ten other travel videos for ""senior"" entertainment ~ all of the travel videos were much enjoyed!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this DVD before our trip to Taiwan in hopes of learning about the country. It was terrible! It missed most of the main points of Taiwan and didn't add anything to learning about what to see and how to get around. The quality of the DVD was worse than any home movie. Don't bother with this one. I would have rated it lower if I could have, because it was so BAD!"
1,Very disappointed with this book,"I read all the reviews for this book and they were so good i decided to buy the book.I did not like the book at all. First of all there were so many editing errors that it was hard to get past that. I thought the storyline could have been stronger between the couple. I am not a writer so this is only my opinion. Usually when i read a romance novel and it is really good i get pulled in by the characters, and i did not feel that way with Caroline and Brian."
3,more like 3 1/2,"i only got through ths book by doing some major skipping. terrible writing, great story. somebody find this woman a better editor and a creative writing class."
1,Waiting to Exhale,"This has to be the most untrustworthy vendor trading on Amazon. It is the second time I have ordered a novel from textbooksrus and I am yet to see a page much less a copy of the book.You may steal a few dollars from me, but trust me, you will lose much more due to your perfidy. Karma always finds a way. Good luck with your cyber treachery."
4,"Loved It, Loved it!","I must have gotten a different edition than most people, because I didn't notice the huge amounts of typos etc.I thought the couple had chemistry. The it factor was definitely there for me. I enjoyed the fact that they didn't just jump into bed immediately."
3,Error city,"The story line was very good and the characters were believable. However, I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer, the misspelled words, the use of italics without any reason, the inappropriate use of pronouns (3 in a row), and the sentence structure (to list a few) were entirely too distracting. It was often enough to make me put the book down and take a break. I rate this book a 3-star because of the story line and the character development. The grammatical errors robbed it of a 4 or 5."
3,So - So,"I wasn't feeling the beginning of this book. It was a bit too stereotypical and I'm sorry to use an 80's term, but fresh. It did settle down towards the middle of the book and that really saved it from it's shaky start. Some characters weren't developed as well or just confused me to irritation, but overall it was a nice and okay read. Just not the best."
1,ONE WORD,THEY JUMPED INTO THE RELATIONSHIP TO DAMN FAST THEY SEEN EACH OTHER ON MONDAY THEN WHEN TUESDAY ROLLED AROUND THEY WERE MADLY IN LOVE. I WANT TO READ ABOUT FALLING IN LOVE NOT BEING STUPID.ASHLEY
2,Couldn't wait to finish it...,"for all the wrong reasons. It started off strong, but Caroline, the main character, becomes a whiny, self-absorbed brat as the book progresses. There are too many plot lines, and characters introduced for the sake of being there. This book had potential, but as it goes on, it just becomes tiresome.I really wanted to like it, but I just didn't."
2,Disappointed,"What a disappointment. Most of the book all I wanted to do was slap Caroline. What a whiny spoiled brat she was. I don't know how Brian put up with her. I would had left a long time ago but I guess love does strange things to people and they did love each other.It's not a book I would read again.I just read Simply Wicked by the same author which I thought was a great book, this one, not so much."
2,"The Ending, At Last...","My expectations were to high in reading this book. Caroline at times seemed to be a little spoiled and a bit of an airhead when it came to matters of safety and reality. Her and Brian seemed to be enamoured with each other but, to me, more so him than her. She was almost too needy and I think Brian could have personally been better off with the best friend. Caroline was suppose to have this stalker but halfway though the book, I was still waiting for the stalker to get his ""stalk on""! Not very well developed with characters and secondary characters. Book should have been over a 100 pages before the ending. AT LAST, it was.If you're looking for a book to pass the time on an airplane or to help you sleep, this is a good read."
2,The sequel is better,"I agree with the other reviewers, very bad editing and continuity problems. The IR factor was bludgeoned to death methinks. And I can understand mega instant attraction but unless it was gonna be a one night stand thing who really trys to kiss someone they just met? As for the stalker plot that should have been fleshed out a bit more. And another thing is it a standard rule that the black heroine can't be dark skinned or can't have hair that does not hang down to her bottom? Please!"
2,Not Feeling This One Too Much,"Okay, I just finished this book this morning on my train ride to work. I've been reading it for about 2 1/2 weeks, and normally it doesn't take me that long to finish a book especially if it is a nice flowing story. I think I was just expecting more out of this story. The two characters, Brian and Caroline met and started a romance fairly quickly which is fine, but then there wasn't really any substance to go with it. The author also had a way of just abruptly changing time frames and days that kind of left you feeling rushed to get to the end of the story and it just left you out there wondering how certain things came about. The editing errors didn't bother me so much as the lack of ""meat"" in the story. I couldn't even give this one 3 stars."
2,Didn't like it,The book's concept was nice but I could only get through about 3 chapters. In each chapter I read the female character mentioned that the couple couldn't work because he was white and she was black. The author seemed to place too much emphasis on their race. I also find two people having that strong of an attraction the day they bump into each other unbelievable.
3,"typos, Typos, TYPOS!","The book had a wonderful plot, but there were some glaring problems that significantly degraded the book.Official ""Ro"" Reasoning:(-0) It was a well-written novel, the plot was great and the characters were wonderful.(-2 Stars) This novel had so many random italicized paragraphs, words and pages, misspelled words, grammar errors, typos and displaced sentences that I wanted to scream. Horrible editing. Absolutely horrible horrible editing. FIRE this person's editor. If not for all the frequent mistakes, this book would have gotten 5 stars.Official ""Ro"" Rating: 3 stars, Borrow It."
2,Not so much....,"If you have very small and girlish hands they will be an ok choice as the company wiil happily send you size ""small"" of their very best thin gloves extremely well made for washing dishes or cleaning fish. Don't be fooled though if your hand are very manly as the only thing large is the length of the cuff. Adequately demonstration of size choices may have helped my happiness level but still the foundation of gloves is very thin and not likely to stand up to my use in more intensive tasks."
3,OK but not up to date,"Ms. Barrie has a good understanding of cockatiel personalities, color mutations, and training, and this is an OK guide in that regard. However, the book is very outdated regarding diet: Other than the all-important fresh greens, it recommends nothing but seeds, a diet that is guaranteed to greatly reduce your cockatiel's potential lifespan of 30 years and diminsh his health and comfort by leading to illness. This can also be costly and heartbreaking for you.Seeds are necessary for small birds because they contain enzymes they can't get anywhere else--but a tablespoon a day is plenty. Pellets, table foods, cooked grains and legumes, and fresh fruits and veggies should make up the other 90% of the diet. The book also recommends offering grit, which is no longer recommended by vets and other experts in avian health.For friendly, accurate, and scientifically current guidance, check out ""Birds for Dummies"" by Dr. Brian Speer, an excellent avian vet."
2,"Basic, but not the best","If you are looking for a Cockatiel book that is very basic, straight to the point, and somewhat blunt, then this is a good choice for a book. But for those who like substance, you might want to try another. Even though you can receive a broad point of view on how to care for your Tiel, I felt that this book just wasn't what I was looking for; too basic. But this book does come with a good explanation on variety of cocktiels, and I absolutely adore the pictures she used."
5,guide to owning a cockatiel,"great book! excellent photography,and highly recommended for those who own or those who are interested in aquiring a cockatiel."
3,"Big Book, Flashy, But Shallow","An okay book, but relys too much on gimmicks and not enough on the comic strips themselves. The result: an overpriced book with a lot of little toys in it which keeps you wanting more Charlie Brown."
2,Not what I thought,"This scale is not as described. It has no foldup top for large items. It takes 6 AA cell batteries, not one 9 volt. The only reason it is named USPS is because the United States Postal Service licensed the name. It is actually made in China for Motion Marketing of Kansas City. I thought I was getting a bargin but this item is made of cheaply molded plastic and has a very flimsy feel to it. I wouldn't buy another."
5,Great!,"I leave overseas and our postal service had change where I have to do everything online. There is not always people available to weight your package so I decided to do it from home. I bought this very simple postal scale. Very accurate and easy to use.I feel like I work now at USPS! I am very happy, I just sent the package with my husband to his work where they collect them and are ready to go!"
1,USPS PS200 22-POUND POSTAL SCALE,My first machine malfunctioned and would not weigh correctly within months of purchase. I returned it for replacement and the replacement malfunctioned just as the first had. The third scale was delivered with the very same defect right out of the box.I sat in my office with two of the WORTHLESS scales in my possession. One I sent back to Amazon for refund and the other one I threw in the garbage can. I bought another brand at less than half the price of the USPS PS200!Don't spend your good money on this JUNK machine!
3,worked for a while,"I can't remember how long ago I purchased this scale, several years ago, now. About 2 years ago, the tare function died and it now reads 2.4 oz, no matter what I do. Since it's electronic, there's no way to get in and re-set it, so now, I'm looking for another one. I've also found that I need one which will accommodate a higher weight, for those Christmas gifts."
3,Good Product,Bought this battery for my garage door opener but the opener still doesn't work. Probably not the battery. Battery came well packaged and looked to be great quality.
2,Item was received damaged,"When I received these items, one of the burner covers was stained. It was a big scrape across the white part on one of the large covers. The other 3 were in good condition, but I did return the set. Otherwise the covers were as pictured."
4,Burner covers,"This is a nice addition to our plate set and other accessories in this shadow iris pattern. They do look good on the stove and gave the finishing touch, but they are priced a lot higher than what I have paid for other burner covers. If you want everything to match they will work. Other than a bit high on price I am pleased with the set. Would recommend if you want all to match."
5,Horn slide and tube brush snake,Excellent price for this good quality product. The length of the snake is ideal for easy cleaning. I bought two of then just in case the manufacture decides to make them shorter to cut cost in the future.
3,Good CD player-but it doesn't play burned cds all the time.,"This is a good CD player, but when you turn on the E.A.S.S. (skip protection), it won't play alot of cd's that are burned. And even when it sometimes does play a burned cd with the EASS on, it will sometimes shut itself off. I know a kid at school with the same player, and his doesn't always work properly with the EASS on while playing a burned CD. Other than that, it is a nice player with good sound quality. I really like the light-up display and the lighted battery low indicator, though."
1,hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............................oh i get it.,"Godard's most intensive foray into the meaningless, blather of French philosophy in the 1960's. Throughout, you are treated (unfairly) to the director's whispering voice-over, which is unbearable, while the content of his narration is even worse. Even the child is a pretentious little wanker. Overall, an extremely indulgent film that does nothing, says nothing and above all means nothing. Godard is much more clever and effective when he uses techniques such as these in a more subtle, restrained fashion, such as in Pierrot Le Fou. More proof why Existenialism, Post-Modernism, and Structuralism should be laid to waste. I don't like Foucalt mixing with my Godard. Perhaps a treat for those who admire this particular school of thought, but I really cannot stomach it. Sorry."
4,My Little Pony Party with Pinkie Pie,I bought this my little pony for my daughter who has an October birthday. She loved both the book and the costumed pony.
4,"Good songs, sing-along quality","The songs are wonderful, and its great to see them available for everyone. The only drawback is the unprofessional production. Still it goes with the book and is a fun activity for families or a sing along for adults."
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book for my daughter, unaware that it explores the big bang theory. However, I was able to successfully remove the page this topic is discussed, and the book still flows well."
1,Author Uses Children's Book to educate own views,"I bought this book for my daughter Audrey's birthday and promptly returned it. If you are a proponent of the Big Bang THEORY of how the earth began and new age thinking, you will enjoy this book. We do not accept these teachings and I find it sad that an author would choose to use a children's picture book to present a theory as fact. We will not purchase any more books from this author."
3,CANNOT support WPA2 in Bridge Mode.,We purchased this unit to bridge our LAN between two buildings. But it cannot support Bridging in WPA2 mode. The manual claims WPA2 (which it can do) and Bridge Mode (which it can do) but it cannot do BOTH at the same time.
1,Misleading advertising and packaging,Netgear advertises in various places and documents and even mentions on the box that it offers wifi bridging -- it does NOT mention the caveat that it can only bridge open or WEP protected networks not WPA protected networks.Back to the store it goes.
4,solid for now,Just deployed one of these on a remote site over a VPN Tunnel to the main office. So far its rock solid..
5,one of the best cds ever,"Great album, having so many of the Johnson Mountain Boys' best songs. When they play concerts (eg MACC in Columbus Ohio every year), many of these songs are played. A ""must have"" for any bluegrass enthusiast."
5,Awesome,"I bought this CD on a drive to Texas from Northern VA. I must have listened to 50 times. All my friends rock out to it all the time, it's sweet!"
5,My Crippled Children's Home,"I heard about this wonderful book from an old friend who knew I had been in a hospital as a child. I entered Newington Crippled Children's Home in CT when I was 5 years old and stayed until I was 8. I have a hip disorder call ""Legg Calvo Perthes"". I went to school and received my First Holy Communion the hospital; I also met the real Superman!I was one of the lucky ones, my parents lived in Newington so they got to visit me for 2 hours on Saturdays and 2 on Sundays. My memories of my time there are hazy but this wonderful book and the pictures put a lot of my childhood into perspective.I highly recommend this book to anyone who stayed at the hospital or anyone who has an interest in the early workings of pediatric hospitals. Excellent source of knowledge."
2,Confusing and distortional presentation of historical facts,"Many major events were missing from the pre american colonial days. The author, well respected by his ""patriotas"", would concur with him that nothing happened or are ashamed to even mention them. The PPD and Dr. Carrion are no more than a torn of a rose bush grown wild. It is very true when you hear that history is written based on the needs of its author. Shame, I would have wished that it was more objective."
5,cool,"Man im not really into this music that much im more of a metal person but these guys give you that old school sound of rock and roll those were the days.IF you like this band get it,it rules!"
5,Believe it or not there is more!,"I have seen the Japanese release of this title and I won't get into it too much but I did want to let all the fans know that another season exists ""Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu"". At the time of the writing of this article the only thing available from Amazon.com is some import soundtrack. So for those of you who think that the ending to season 1 is a little ""lacking"" and doesn't tie up a lot of lose ends you will be happy to hear that this title is currently in plans for season 3. I still wait for Fumoffu to get translated and released!"
2,1DK Death Clutch Review,"No problems from the transaction and delivery viewpoint. Item shipped as promised. I only rated 2 stars because absolutely no instructions came with the shipment. While it's true that a person can search around online and find out how to operate the device, it seems very reasonable to me that some instructions would be provided, especially since someone could possibly injure themselves trying to figure it out."
3,"A decent read, but not great","Dean Koontz can write some great pieces of fiction (Life Expectancy, for example), but Velocity is not in that league. The book starts quickly and the main character, Billy Wiles, finds himself ensnared in a sociopathic's killing spree and putting Billy Wiles in situations that are unimaginable and frightening.The plot moves quickly for about half the book. Koontz knows how to keep a reader interested and turning the pages, but the book slows down and as the killer and his plot unfolded I found myself disappointed. The suspense collapses near the end and the book left me with a feeling of ambivalence when I finished reading the story.It's worth reading, but Koontz has written better books."
4,First time Koontz reader enjoyed it...,"I have never read any of Dean Koontz's novels, and just picked this one up randomly. I really enjoyed the story, but it is so violent & disturbing that I felt guilty for reading it. However, all in all, I did enjoy the book. Can anyone suggest better Koontz books for me to read?"
3,Did Not Live Up To The Hype,"I thought this book was just ok, just enough to keep you coming back. I only read it when I was on travel and had nothing else to do. The plot was ok, but it was way too drawn out with the mundane and the conclusion or climax was very simple. Im going give another of his books a read because I bought it already, but if its anything like this one it will take me another few months or so to finish."
3,A good read from a veteran writer,"I actually stopped liking Koontz's books a few years ago, as I felt that he had started to mail them in (as do many long-established writers). His books seemed churned out too quickly and at times not worth the paper. I had the same feeling about Velocity, but my brother insisted this one was different. It was. Very well-written, fast paced, and really kept me on the edge of my seat. I'm not saying I'm going to go back and catch all of Koontz's other books, but this one's definitely worth a read. Keep in mind that it's a suspense thriller, not a horror/monster story."
4,Brrrrrr.....,"Another scary one from Dean Koontz. Never high literature, but always an entertaining nail biter nonetheless. Koontz is a regular on my annual beach reading list and never disappoints! Nothing like being sucked into a madman's serial killing spree while hubby frolicks in the sand with the kids! Happy reading!"
3,Not as good as previous books,"This was the first Dean Koontz book I read. I thought it was pretty good, I was interested in the story. But it was a little hard to follow. I read The Taking and The Face afterwards and decided that Velocity wasn't as good as either of the others. Both The Taking and The Face had me eager to keep reading. All 3 of the stories take place over a span of a few days. But in the very end of the book, Velocity jumps ahead and tries to give a happy ending that you're hoping for. The story should have ended at the end of running around. It was quite confusing and didn't seem to make much sense who the killer was and his connection to the main character."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Great beach read. Once you get into the story (first few pages and you'll be hooked), you won't be able to put it down until you finish. Interesting characters and not too creepy. Scary, yes, but not overly gruesome. Great plot twists."
4,A fast read and a good book!,"If you have some spare time to kill you could do a lot worse than this book. It keeps your attention till the end. It is by far the best Koontz novel I've read thus far, but I've only read 4 or 5.There's really nothing I can see making this book a classic, but overall I really enjoyed the suspense and I thought it was well written.My only complaint is it felt like the story was rushed at the end. Then I figured that that is the point. With a book named velocity I would only expect to feel like the velocity of the book increased as you read it. If this is what he intended then I think he did a fine job."
3,Not quite good to the last drop...,"OK, so I was LOVING this book, until about the last 20-30 pages. It ended like a mediocre horror movie. The aspects of suspense were very well crafted throughout the entire story, but the ending was a HUGE disappointment. I've never had such a disappointment with Koontz. Too bad - it defintely had potential."
4,"Great book, weak ending","This page was definitely one of his better recent books. The plot was great, the tie-in of other characters was well done, and the detail was exquisite. However, instead of going out with a bang like Koontz' books usually do, I felt this one ended in a bit of a fizzle - like there should be more to the end of the story."
3,"In the end, a little disappointed....","I enjoyed this book - don't get me wrong with what I'm about to say - but there was one thing that nagged me until the end, and when I saw the Author's Note, I hoped it would be resolved. The note referenced all the T. S. Eliot quotes (and as a huge fan of Eliot's poetry, I loved seeing them used this way!) and some other things, but never once was the huge reference to the work of Philip K. Dick mentioned.For any who have read Dick's book Valis, the connection there is clear... the man and machine, the name, the colors, everything. I was profoundly disappointed that Koontz didn't at least tip his hat to this brilliant work when he pretty blatantly pulled from it.The book is still worth a read, but I doubt I'll buy any more Koontz novels for this reason alone. He wouldn't like it if someone ripped his ideas so clearly, I'm sure. A simple reference is all that it would have taken."
2,Disopointing,This book was fast passed then it lost my intereset I knew right away who the killer was but Koontz is forgiven this time
1,a real stinker like many of his newer ones,This novel makes almsot no sense and was so anti climactic it reminded me of richard laymons darkness tell us. Another pos The idea si to keep things moving so fast you wont realise that someone would never do this crap and would just goto the police. Like whispers in the pointless oow bet u didn't know this was the baddy crap at the end so outa left field your liek wtffftff
1,A sad attempt at a story by a pretty messed up mind,"I couldn't bother to finish this book. All the critics so far have been polite. What's wrong with Dean? He seems to be flailing about for things that will shock you. In the process, he develops grisly mutilation vignettes. Then strings them together weakly (oh look, a bottomless pit for body disposal). Do you need more mutilation stories in your life? As a community, do we need more fodder for future Columbine youths? Perhaps this writing is therapy for him in some way. But it's likely to be damaging to any one else. Books like this should carry some kind of rating. I'd never want my kids to see this. And I be happier having skipped it. Save your money, your time and your summer."
4,4 1/2 stars,"I don't think this is his best work but Dean Koontz rarely disappoints me, as I did enjoy this novel. His stories generally move fast and he always has some unique characters (one studies the art of Aruspicy. ""\A*rus""pi*cy\, n. [L. aruspicium, haruspicium.] Prognostication by inspection of the entrails of victims slain sacrifice."")A satisfying and quick read that should keep most Koontz fans happy.Recommended"
1,Give me a break,"I saw the book on a best seller stand at Barnes & Noble and decided to give it a whirl. It is ridiculous pulp fiction, a mismash of brazen coincidences with puerile attempts to go over the top in gruesome descriptions, and it never comes together. It became a bad slog about half way through, I finished it out of curiosity, not about how the plots end, but how the bizarre brain of the author would unleash itself.The book isn't shocking, or interesting, or anything other than a silly murder thriller piece of pulp fiction."
2,Made-For-TV-Movie Feel,"My first outing with Dean didn't start off so good. The premise is fantastic -- a man discovers a letter on his windshield and asked to decide who should die. He has 6 hours to decide. Great idea, right? Well, too bad Dean drops the ball and forgets about the letters a third of the way through. Only 4 letters are sent with choices for our protagonist to decide. The story then decends into standard psycho fare with a very anticlimatic ending. Anyone that has read serial killer material will be treading over similar ground with this one. I'm sure this isn't Koontz's best work, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and read a few more books before sending him packing."
3,"I love Koontz, but.....","Don't get me wrong, I am a loyal, avid reader of everything Dean Koontz, but it seems like many pages of this book were simply filler. The premise is terrifying, enthralling, but I found myself skimming through pages and pages of mindless detail. I feel like Mr. Koontz is writing too much, too fast. Each new book I enjoy less than the previous one. Seems to me his brilliant mind has too many great ideas, and he's just pumping out novels as quickly as possible instead of taking the time to really develop a GREAT story. Remember Lightning? THAT was Dean Koontz at his finest. If you're a Koontz fan, this book is definately worth the read. If you're recommending a Koontz book to a newbie, don't pick this one."
5,Excellent Original Story,"Billy Wiles leads a simple life. He is a bartender in Napa Valley. His Fiancée has been in a coma for four years and he is devoted to her, visiting her on a regular basis. Out of the blue, he has been chosen by a devious killer to make decisions concerning future victims...who should live, who should die and how they should die. The premise of this story is surprisingly original (hard to find these days). Some very unusual characters people this book and they are all very life-like (which is pretty scary when you think about it). Dean Koontz is sometimes unpredictable as a storyteller. I loved Odd Thomas. I didn't care for Life Expectancy. But, Velocity is one of those books that is very hard to put down. I wanted to make it last, but just couldn't do it. The pages fly by. An excellent read."
4,Overall a pretty good book.,"This seems to be one of Dean Koontz's better books. It is a fast paced book that will never leave you with a dull moment. One thing that made the book better was that there was no love story that took up half the book, there was no villain with a massive sweet tooth, and there was no villain that an over the top hatred for sex which usually is a staple in his other books."
2,Misses the mark,"The narrative dragged on and on... very little dialog, which should be expected from a story that has only one character - Billy Wiles. He didn't have anyone to talk to.In my opinion, Koontz is a hit and miss writer. I have read 11 of his books and found only one worth recommending... Watchers. The rest of his books have been duds."
4,Not One Of Koontz's Best But Still A Great Read,This is by far not one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels but I buy all his books. He is a great story teller and this book is very much worth reading. I would definately suggest this book to anyone who like Dean Koontz. It is very entertaining.
2,Quality of his work is slipping,"I don't know what all the fuss is-this book just didn't do it for me. I liked his earlier work but lately he is just getting worse and worse. nothing suspenseful about it. It was boring, boring, boring."
4,Nail-biter!,"I have read several Koontz novels and think this is one of his best. It is the prototypical psycho-thriller that he is so good at creating. This is one of the books that I recommend to first-timers that have never read his work. Invariably, they all get hooked!"
3,I can't decide if I liked it or not,"Was Billy a good guy or not? At the end was he justified in his actions?I empathized with his situation, but as another reviewer pointed out - the absolute helplessness which he seemed to be experiencing during most of the book became difficult to endure. I think most of us knew who it wasn't even though Billy thought otherwise. Many of the situations as the book developed were very much the suspend belief type of events.I guess in hind sight his obsession with protecting his wife seems to cloud his judgement on the best way to protect her. Stepping back it is a page turner, but sometimes turning the page to get away from the current action. Maybe an alternative title should have been Out Of Control."
4,One of the best Koontz books I've read yet.,"How would you like to get off work, walk to your car, and find this note on your windshield? ""If you don't call the police I will kill a beautiful woman. If you do, I will kill an old woman involved in charity work.""Most of Koontz recent books have disappointed me (with the exception of: False Memory, From the Corner of His Eye, and Intensity). This book kept me turning pages. The villain, as with that in most of his books, is a real evil incarnate. As with all of his books I've read, I had to know who he/she was, and I hoped he would kill them in a vicious manner. I haven't read many of his older works, so I don't know how they compare with his new stuff. I know one thing. I liked this one. In fact, I'd like to see this made into a well made movie. I still feel that Koontz has a super scary all time classic up his sleeve. Maybe he'll save that for his grand finale."
2,Koontz can do better,I'm a Dean Koontz fan but this book just didn't have it. The novel started off well but the characters were not developed enough to keep me enthralled. Plot was OK if not a bit gross. The story just wasn't woven well at all. The ending was no big thrill either.
4,Intense Thriller,"Koontz isn't one of my favorite authors but I did enjoy Velocity. It was quite the page turner for most of the book. The plot was suspenseful and not predictable. The ending of the book got a bit dragged out and I don't think he tied up the loose ends in an entertaining way. For the most part, enjoyable reading."
3,An average novel. . .,"I'm a little disappointed with this novel. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but it didn't live up to its hype (based upon other reviews on Amazon).It took me a week to read VELOCITY. On several occasions, I seriously considered giving up because it's such a dark, depressing and dumb storyline. The last time I considered giving up, I was less than 50 pages from the end. Neverless, I hunkered down and finished reading it.When I finish reading a very good book (but not with this book), I'll say to myself ""WOW!"" and I'll think back and savor what I just read. Sometimes I feel disappointed that the story has ended or I begin to make plans to read other books by that author. With VELOCITY, I felt nothing when I finished it. There was an emptyness. I just regretted that I wasted my time with a very average novel. It is not a book that I would re-read again. My biggest complaint about the storyline is that it's simply not believable."
5,Velocity,"This was my first Dean Koontz novel, and I loved it. From the moment I picked it up I was hooked. The ending was fairly quick and simple but the rest of the book made up for it."
4,A real page-turner,I really enjoyed this book. Blasted through it in a couple of days. Interesting plot keeps you on the edge of your seat pretty much the whole time. Ending could have been a little better but was still good.Koontz is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.
2,Very Disappointed!,"I love Koontz! Must have read 10-15 of his earlier works. I havent read in awhile(because of an injury), and now I'm back and Velocity souded good. What a let down. This is non-comparable to anything else I have read from Koontz. So much wasted words! Beware!"
5,Awesome!,"Time constraints prevent me from writing a lengthy review, but you can get those elsewhere, anyway. Suffice to say that ""Velocity"" is one of Dean Koontz' best ever. VERY highly recommended!"
1,Stop reading around page 250,"Every time I decide to give Dean Koontz another try, I'm disappointed and swear it will be my last...This author comes up with some really interesting story concepts, and this book certainly falls into that category. I LOVED the first 250 or so pages. Then it appears that he either doesn't know what to do with the story, so it takes a really lame turn towards a lame ending, or he throws in something extreme and unnecessary to the storyline in the guise of being ""fresh"". The latter applies to this story. Stop reading when our main character enters his coworker's apartment.Overall, a disappointment."
2,"Not so great, but still thrilling","I have read many Dean Knootz's books. Velocity is the one I enjoyed the least. The plot is interesting but weak. I cannot understand why in hell they did not report to the police and just play on with the killers' game. The ending is weak also. I will not recommend it. Try Life Expectancy or Odd Thomas, and you will be rewarded with a much stronger, much more interesting and more humane story."
3,Velocity by Dean Koontz - one of my favorite writers,"Velocity was a entertaining read. I gave it 3 stars because it was below Odd Thomas and Frankenstein which were extremely intense and I couldn't put them down. Velocity kept my interest and had several plot twists that were unexpected. Another captivating read by Dean Koontz who I believe can run hot and cold. But don't get me wrong - a good book by Dean can't be BEAT for a weekend escape into suspense, suprise and creepiness!"
5,Velocity -- a fast-pased performance!,"I have read and enjoyed most of Koontz's novels. I just about quit reading this one because it was a little more ""graphic"" than I like, but I did finish it and am glad I did. Koontz writes an intelligent and engulfing story. I look at his picture on the jacket and can't imagine that such a delightfully pleasant looking man can possibly carry such devious plots of murder and perversion in his head. He does have a mishevious twinkle in his eye, however. I always enjoy the perspective Koontz provides between good and evil, and, somehow, I am left with a peaceful feeling at the end, even though, at times the evil seems so encompassing."
5,"""Could not put it down""","The above overused cliche was true for me in the case of Velocity. Unbelieveably soon after his last book, Mr Koontz has turned out another great read that is a true ""page turner"". This time no supernatural or sci fi; just an old fashioned ""who done it?"", spiced up by paralleling some of the bizarre current events from our ailing society, as seen every day on CNN. For all the gore and bodies, a very touching theme centered around a loved one with a feeding tube (sound familiar?). Appearing are many worthwhile quotes from T. S. Eliot that work into the hero's struggle to find not only the ""fiends"" but also his sanity and direction in a purversely sick world."
5,Great read,Velocity keeps pace with the other thrillers in Koontz's collection. Good characters and a fast pace makes it very entertaining.
5,A return to top form,"I loved this book and found it extremely gripping if not a bit (okay, more than a bit) far-fetched. That said, I read this book alone and totally freaked myself out every night because it was really scary. There are some sections of the book that will blow your mind. I was not bored a bit, but I found myself thinking that nobody would do the things that Billy, the main character, did. I haven't read a Dean Koontz book in years because he started getting too weird. I only like to read books about people and things that could really happen. I highly recommend this book and look forward to his next book."
2,Doesn't Move Fast Enough,Velocity starts out interesting and then drags.The murderer is uninteresting and doesn't seem connected to the story.It is really a 2 1/2stars story.
2,I like suspense and danger but not this type of suspense and danger.,"I purchased this three years ago. I could not finish it. I did not do a review at the time thinking Koontz was not an author for me. Recently I read Lightning by Koontz and loved it. Therefore I'm now reading several of his books. I'm posting this as part of a group of reviews for comparison purposes - for readers who have tastes similar to mine.I was frustrated, afraid, and felt hopeless watching Bill being threatened and manipulated by the killer. Each time the killer killed someone he would plant murder evidence in Bill's home or property. Bill had to frantically search, find, and get it out. I prefer the protagonist be able to have some control over something.My feeling: The killer is laughing as he forces a bug to run around in a maze, eventually planning to squish him. I am the bug. This was no fun. Maybe it was good at the end, but I couldn't stand being in the maze long enough to get there."
2,Very disappointing,"I will start out by saying that this has been only the third Dean Koontz book I have read. The first two were brilliant. I first read False Memory and then followed it up with Intensity. I couldn't have been more pleased. So I wanted to read another and found Velocity. I have to say it was a major disappointment. Without throwing spoilers out there I will just say that there are a lot of things that he did not do his homework on. (the taser bit especially) I found the book to be predictable and rushed. Sorry Mr. Koontz, I just can not recommend this book."
4,WOOHOO,"The book really had action the entire time through, though there were numerous periods of two or three chapters where the character is walking around his house or something else and just thinking. There would be an exciting chapter, then 2 or 3 dull, then it picks up again, then puts you to sleep. In the end, it was one of the most exciting finales I've read in a while."
3,"I Love Koontz, but......","Koontz is an excellent author, so don't take it personally when I state my opinion that Velocity was my least favorite of his works (Out of the 18 Koontz novels I've read).Velocity is a popular read due to it's fast pace and excellent character development.....two strengths of Koontz.My reason for rating this novel ""only"" a 3 star is the overall dark/evil feeling throughout the novel. This is especially noted with his graphic character development of the antagonist....unfortunately, Koontz did this a little too well for my taste. Although he always spends a great deal of time making you hate the evil character, he usually spends proportionally more time dwelling on the light side. I personally prefer his ""upbeat"" style found in Watchers, Lightning, Husband, Odd Thomas and Christopher Snow series.Don't get me wrong, Koontz is awesome and Velocity was a page turner. If you're the kind of reader who doesn't object to the darkness, you'll love it."
2,sad,"Definitely disappointing. I wouldn't have finished the book had it not been the fact that I've already paid for it. Character development was minimal to non-existent. The only in depth internal analysis that the author gives is that of the main character, but I didn't find myself empathizing with the protagonist at all. I spent more time getting frustrated with the passiveness of the character than deploring his fate or anticipating what's going to happen next, which is the foundation for a decent suspense novel. The ending was also incredibly weak and contrived. Nothing in the plot shows any cleverness. The first chapter had some humor, that's the only positive thing about this book."
2,Seemed to get lost along the way.,"I think this could have been 2 good books, instead it was one fuddled book. I love the starting premise but as another reviewer stated, Koontz spent way to much time trying to develope the main characters excuses for his behavior. Unfortunately, I don't feel the excuses worked.I would have preferred pure Koontz dealing with the notes and maybe typical off-the-cuff Koontz dealing with the wife and the past history with the police.I will admit it kept me until the end, I was just disappointed."
2,Very disappointed,"Koontz's work is always uneven and I thought this was not one of his best. The premise started out very good but degenerated and all went downhill from there.Mysterious notes on your windshield and people getting killed from the choices that you make - what a brilliant and novel way to start the novel. But maybe I didn't like the choices the protagonist made to solve the mystery and I thought the ending was downright silly.That was the con. The pros of a Dean Koontz novel, they are always easy to read. If you are a fan, don't bother buying this one and waste your money, just get it used or from the library."
4,Enjoyable,"I would rate this three and a half out of five stars. It's not because this is a BAD book, but because it simply is not Koont's best work, or even close. It has solid parts, some great characters, some quirky situations and enough surprises and twists and turns to keep this book a solid page-turner, but it felt a bit more 'light' to me and not as serious as some of his other books - some of the things the killer did to our bartender felt a bit silly and over the top, as were his motives - he just did not feel that much of a plausible villain to me.Still, if you're a Koontz fan, you should find this a enjoyable if somewhat light read. Personally I enjoyed 'False Memory' and 'Lightning' better, but that's just me. I honestly liked this book."
5,Fast paced and very fun,"I know others were disapointed in this book, but I gave it a chance because I like Mr. Koontz's work. I really enjoyed this book. I would have to compare this to Darkfall, a fast moving, high energy novel. I was just hanging on every page to see what Bill Wiles was going to have to go through next. The horrible things he was faced with was making me cringe on every page. Having to deal with personal problems like a wife in a coma while trying to keep from getting caught for a murder he was framed for, that was just brutal. You also can't help but like Billy's character. The ending was well worth the read as well. It unpredictable leaves you satisfied. If you want a quick entertaining read where you can shut your mind off and fly through the pages I highly recomend this book."
3,Accidental enjoyment,"I purchased this book as a surprise gift and it turned out to be the wrong book completely. Apparently there is a book about cars called ""Velocity"" too!So,not wanting to waste the $.30 it cost me to buy this pre-owned book, I cracked it open. It was my first Koontz novel and I was happily taken along for the suspensful ride he created. Quick pace, interesting characters, a bit of gore, plot twists and a similar knee bouncing rush to a too much caff in your half caff latte! Recommended reading even if you find yourself paying over a dollar!CAO"
2,Review - Velocity,"I got this book seeing it on a NY Times best seller list and thought it should be pretty good. Boy was I wrong about that. This book was extremely slow moving and quite dull. I could not even make it to the half way point of the book, as ultimately nothing exciting or even significant was happening.I did give this book one extra star due to the theme of the book. The idea of a person having to make two agonizing choices and hold the lives of others in the balance is a phenominal concept. This book has a great theme but it is poorly executed.I would not recommend this book, however if you do like the murder genere of books than by all means pick it up. It is certainly not for everyone."
3,"Eh, Better Than ""Breathless.""","Interesting.Very interesting.Koontz did better with this novel than BREATHLESS, that's for sure. No dog this time around either, which came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.The killer or 'freak' in this novel had an interesting premise to him, in that he was a superhero mixed with demon all in one. He could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and it didn't matter what anybody tried to do to stop him.However. And there's always a however.The whole 'ending' section of this novel felt a little rushed. I didn't really understand why certain things happened, and I don't think it's for a lack of trying, or for paying attention. It was a neat little clean wrapup, but it did leave me feeling a little lacking. I would've liked to see either a happier ending or a darker ending, if that makes any sense. Just seemed a little mediocre.All in all, a great fast-paced Koontz read, but it is Koontz all the same.Reccomended beach or airplane novel."
5,Hold on Tight!,"Dean Koontz, in my opinion, is a pyschopath. And I mean that in a good way. I have not read a book by him in many many years, and this one had me checking my doors and windows several times to make sure they were locked. Which, according to the book, locked doors and windows were no defense anyway so I was wasting my time. It was a roller coaster ride from beginning to end.I do admire Billy for the decisions he made, even though they may have been different than the ones I made. Would I have gone to the police? Thousands of what-ifs went through my mind as I was reading this book. Since I've never been in a situation like that, I don't know for sure what I would have done. Cried a lot, I'm sure.The only thing that really irritated me was the ending. While it makes sense in some ways, I still felt it was just wrapped up WAY too nicely in the last chapter. Maybe I'm just a cynic."
4,High octane tension,"Exactly what you want for a summer read. Tense, high stakes and a twisted plot that compels you to turn the page as fast as you can. Billy Wiles is a laid back bartender in the Napa Valley. One night when he leaves work, there is a note under his windshield wiper that reads: If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher somewhere in Napa County. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have six hours to decide. The choice is yours.That's the moment you reach the crest of the hill on the roller coaster.And that's chapter one.Great fun, and the perfect antidote to a boring summer day."
4,Nail Biting suspense,"This is a tight book. My only complaint is the main character's reactions to what's happening to him is very understated and lacks realism. That aside, It rocks. Gets into you and creeps you out. Read with lights on."
3,"Fairly good book, not his best","If you have never read a Dean Koontz book before, don't start with this one. He is one of the better authors out there, far superior to Mr. King in terms of not overdoing the details, and I personally think his plotlines are not continuously recycled. That being said, you should also read this book with an empty stomach. There is an event that was so graphic I actually had to put the book DOWN, walk away for a half an hour, and return before I could continue with the description. The book itself is well written, Koontz had my attention from beginning to end, I actually wanted to know whodunit. However, I do agree with many of the reviews who said that most of this is not plausible. Exactly how many of Koontz's novel are plausible people? Lightining is all about time travel between the now and WWII! Enjoy it for the fictional story that it is and allow that even the best writer's miss their stride every now and then."
3,Disappointing,"This book was OK, but I wouldn't recommend it to people. I loved the concept of this book- the ethical dilemmas it posed for its main character- and I couldn't wait to crack it open when it arrived in the mail (I buy all of Koontz's books.) Once I started reading, though, I found it to be written in a very average fashion with characters that didn't feel real to me. I can usually give specific reasons for not liking a book; I really can't with this one. All I can do is equate it to a movie, The Truman Show, which was another instance where I thought the concept was fantastic but the actual result fell a bit flat. Maybe if you've never read Koontz before & you're just looking for something quick and entertaining, you could give this a shot. When I pick up a Dean Koontz book, though, I expect more from him. I know he can do better (if you want a fantastic thriller, give ""Intensity"" a try!)"
3,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book. I felt the ending was a bit rushed however, and it is definitely not Dean's best work. But it is a good read and should be read by any fan of his."
3,Koontz in it for the money?,I don't know..I have at least 7 books by Koontz and I know theres probably another 30 out there i haven't read. I got all excited to read Velocity but by the 6th chapter it felt like a script for an upcoming made for tv movie. Koontz seems to have turned into the formula man. A shot rings out and now we have to guess the why whos and wheres which wouldn't be so bad if it were well written and well thought out. I used to love Koontz's work after Steven King recommened him about 8 years ago but now...Koontz churns them out like a bakery. Maybe he needs the dough?
3,Beware,"I have read about one third of this book, and I'm not sure if I will finish it. I have been a Dean Koontz fan for many years and have read many of his books. Velocity is just way too dark and intense for me. Yes, it is extremely fast paced. Yes, Koontz' writing and characterizations are above par, but the unrelenting darkness is very hard to take. I suppose kudos to Koontz are in order because his protagonist is so real, so well-defined that I have to constantly remind myself that this is a work of fiction. Velocity should have a warning label."
5,Garden Tool Organizer is great,"This item is ingeniously constructed so that the organizing pocket cover fits snugly over the container and is removable for washing. It's lightweight, easy to assemble and a great improvement over the organizer bucket I've been hauling around."
1,Too dainty for kids...or adults,"My daughter received this as a gift. It arrived in a cute little faux velvet bag. My daughter took it out of the bag and it was horribly tangled. In an attempt to untangle the chain it broke, and all within a moment of having this dainty little necklace.I threaded a thin ribbon through the heart which will work for now. It is a very cute necklace, but because it is for children, it should be more sturdy."
3,Heart Pendant,"Sweet little pendant. Wish it had a finished back and a little prettier shade of pink. Gift recepient, 5 yrs. old, loved it."
1,DOA,Would not zero. Broken/misassembled erector mechanism. Returned to Woodbury Outfitters and replacement requested. No replacement received (yet). The rifle zeroed fine with a different scope.
3,"Good scope, not what they say it is though","I recieved this scope in 3 days, very fast. Opened the box, and it DOES NOT come with lens covers, hunter turrets or the windage mildots that burris claims this comes with. The scope works great, but whoever put this posting on here needs to change it."
2,Nice scope but mine was defective at full magnification,"At full magnification (9x) the image was very blurry. I've read great things about this scope and I'm surprised. Nice looking and seems well built, clear image, good light, but had to return mine. Have a bad taste in my mouth so may go to another brand but for the money you can't go wrong with this scope, if you get one that works properly."
1,the usual nonsense,"I am an elderly gay man who has read the entire KJV Bible, and I can assure you that it does indeed condemn, in no uncertain terms, all same-sex behavior. This is one of a number of silly books that attempt to pretend that these passages have somehow been misunderstood."
2,There's better Lit. out there.,"This book is sketchy and doesn't seem to have a voice of any human being. Reading it I felt like it was possibly written by a robot of some kind. A better title is ""What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality"""
3,God is Not a Homophobe,It teaches you how to study scriptures. This is important as not to be led astray by the conservative right. Tony at upwardedge.com
3,Nothing special,"I made this purchase after stalling on buying black CZ's a long time. Black CZ's tend to be sort of nothing and disappear, nothing to make them stand out. The thing that changed my mind was that these earrings were described as ""Brilliant cut"". I am not a jeweler so cannot tell you for sure that these are or are not brilliant cut, but the name has always meant to me that the gem will have numerous facets to display special brilliancy or reflective quality. These earrings do not have much sparkle, as the cuts are not numerous, seem small, and are restricted to the further-most edges of the stone, leaving the flat black top the most visible. Thus, the earrings appear like black buttons. If you want a very subtle dark gem, these might be for you, but I wanted sparkle to bring them alive and be a bit eye-catching, and it's barely there."
1,disappointing,"I did not read the reviews before purchasing this item, and wish I had. I have the 1617 EVS Bosch router, and as other people mentioned you need an adapter to make THIS adapter work-- very screwy! For the price, it's cheaper just to buy a whole new base for my router. It would be nice if there was a better description of this item, and what routers it fits and which ones it doesn't. The description on Amazon is really not accurate. Careful!"
5,needs RA1126,"This item is great, but you'll need to buy the RA1126 Templet Guide Adapter in order to use it with a Bosch router. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell the RA1126, so I had to get it from internationaltool.com. The shipping cost more than the part."
1,wrong adapter in bundle,Amazon sells this adapter in a bundle along with a 7 template guide set and a router fence. But it's the wrong adapter what you need is the RB1370 to adapt the template guides to the Bosch router base. McFeely's has them for $13. The RA1100 is used to adapt non Bosch template guides to the RB1370. Without the Rb1370 you template set is useless.
4,Works,"Not much to say, other than it works...My Bosch Router was not compatable with Porter-Cable jigs. This item definately saved the day."
4,Fits Nicely into My Bosch Router,"It would have been better if my Bosch 1617 router came with a base plate with a hole small enough to take P&G template guides--or if such a base plate could be bought separately. But, not the case. The adapter does do the job. However, the instructions that came with it are not so hot, so it takes some fiddling to figure out how to install the adapter."
3,Just not standard,"Almost every other router manufacturer uses the same standard design. Bosch has a 2"" opening in the baseplate that requires still another fitting. I am having trouble finding the part that goes with this adapter, so I haven't been able to use it yet."
5,Works great,"I used this on my router to cut a bunch of dovetailed drawers using a template. Worked great, no issues."
5,Just keeps getting better,By far this is the best disk yet in the pretear series. The show was great befor but now it just keeps getting better. The action has increased in this one especially in the last episode of this disk. Their are a few plot twist which are also very good and pretty much unexpected. The plot keeps getting better also. the animation is just as good as in the other disks and the dubbing is great. If you loved the las two disks you'll love this one. If you haven't seen this show yet buy it its just to good.
5,Essential Wolverine volume 2 is Essential!,"Essential Wolverine volume 2 is Essential! this collection reprints Wolverine #24-47 written by Larry Hama and art by Marc Silvestri and others! Wolverine encounters many experiences like fighting the Japanese Yakuza, Lady Deathstryke,Albert and Sabertooth. The book also has guest apperanced by the Amazing Punk,Nick Fury, and Cable! Some of the artwork is drawn by Top Cow founder, Marc Silvestri. This book is great starting point for fans who liked the run by Larry Hama and Marc Silvestri. Buy it! Highest Possible Recommendation!"
2,Black and White Only!,"What all 3 of the reviews posted ahead of mine and the missing product information on this collection FAIL to mention is that this book is NOT an identical reprint of Wolverine's first monthly ongoing solo book starting in 1988, issues #24-47. Those comics were published in full color, and this collection is black and white only with NO COLORS. So yeah, you can get the gist of the story and the art before the colorists worked their special magic on it, but this is certainly no replacement for finding the actual issues themselves. My low rating is for the misleading product, not for the content of the story or artwork."
3,This para foil could use more tail from the factory,"Para foil kites help make spring a joy. The small ones will fly in as little as 3 to 4 mph wind and the big ones pull so hard the kids giggle. Way cooler than old-fashioned kites. And, it gets them ready for using the para foil to lift themselves into the air when they get older. :-) This one needed more tail to be stable in normal winds, than was provided from the factory. But that's okay because it provided a teachable moment."
1,Wrong message,My review will be short. I have read Ms Donovan's other books and thoroughly enjoyed them. The dialog was witty and engaging between the characters and the plots if not real were what romance books are for. This book fails on all levels. First the premise is irresponsible and rather frightening. I hope younger readers don't think that an anonymous roadside sexual encounter with a stranger is romance. The dialog between the protagonists lacked spark and their inners angsts became whiny. Whatever Ms Donovan was attempting to portray in this novel was lost on me. If you must read this book go to the library and borrow it.
1,lets' flip roles here,"Sorry. Hated the book. Let;s just switch roles here, shall we. Lets say it was Joe who was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him; flips out and decides to have a fling with a woman. He then goes on to marry his girlfriend.Ladies, we would call this guy a cad! And the woman he had a one night stand with would be called a slut. Its interesting how people turn a blind eye to an act of betrayal if it is committed by the main characters of the story."
4,book review,"This is a great accompaniement to the Ennegram book I am reading. I decided since I started reading this book it would be great to have a workbook to go with it, making my journey with this book more meaningful."
2,Disappointing,"I picked this up in a secondhand bookshop having read the excellent 'Wisdom of the Enneagram' by Riso and Hudson and hoping to learn more. I just wouldn't recommend it. I got very little from it, and compared to the depth of R&H's model it felt insubstantial and even confusing. I highly recommend Riso and Hudson's books as a starting point, especially 'Wisdom..' ... I really wanted to get something from Vollmar's book but ended up giving it away to a charity shop."
1,I must have gotten the bad one,Worked for 1 minutes and then lost pressure. No matter how much I pump the pressure up it will not give a good stream of weed killer.
4,Just as listed.,Product works great. Sprays nice and even with no clogging. Great for small jobs that don't require a lot of solution.
5,Great,I bought this sprayer with talstar a few years ago and it worked great and did the job. Stream can be adjusted and can also get to hard to reach places. It shoots up to 20 feet when pumped up. I definately recommend this product.
3,Worked for 8 months,This model has a design flaw - overtime the mechanism to release solution from the chamber wears out and eventually fails. I bought a Roundup brand sprayer from Lowe's and it has performed more reliably than this one. I advise considering a different model/brand.
1,"Decent sprayer, once","I bought this sprayer to spray the lawn for ticks. It worked just fine the first time, and I was pleased. The second time? The plastic brace on the shut-off was already so worn it would just slip out. There's no way to fix it."
1,It's just ok until it breaks,"I bought this last September and had used it 3 times up until today. I didn't expect this sprayer to last forever, but it couldn't get through spraying 4 gallons. Yes, 4 gallons! If you look at the lever that activates the sprayer, you will see that is designed to fail. It takes a fair amount of force to activate it and the lever pulls out a plastic piston-like piece. The way the lever is attached to the piston is cheesy to say the least. It will fail pretty quickly. I highly recommend you buy a different sprayer unless you only want to use this a couple of times before you toss it in the trash."
1,Can't give a zero,"Unbeliveable after only two months the tank has split, spraying right out the side. I have had several pump sprayers over the years and never had one this bad. Maybe I can wrap it in duct tape :-)"
2,Cheap mechanism,I purchased this item because it got excellent reviews. I was very disappointed when the spraying mechanism failed within 15 minutes. I wasn't able to get through my small lawn before I had to rig the mechanism to work. Do not buy this device. Spend the extra money and get a professional unit.
3,Chapin sprayer,This product is OK for the price but it has it's shortcomings. One thing is that it shoots a stream and that's ok for what I need but it does not turn into a spray. I think you have to buy a special nozzle.
1,Does not work,"The sprayer valve is defective on this item. Fill the container with deer away spray, screw on the top, pump the handle, point the wand, squeeze the handle, NOTHING COMES OUT. Unscrew the top, face full of deer away spray. Wash self off and try to get rid of smell. Repeat process with water checking each piece. Get to the valve and that's it - nothing gets through the valve. Sold by Amazon. I'm 5 days past the return date so no I can't return it. Complete waste of $$$."
5,Lawn and Garden Sprayer,Excellent price and product. No problems when using this sprayer unlike a more expensive one that I purchased at a garden store before this one.
1,Won't hold pressure,"I must have received a bad product. My lid does not seal and will not hold pressure. I suppose on something like this I should have purchased locally, as sending it back isn't worth it."
4,Spraying permethrin,"Works well. No issues so far.Pros: small and mobile.Cons: the spray nozzle is omnidirectional, it sprays 360 around and outward from the nozzle. Would have been better if it was focused 180' or 90'. Not so much as a con but if being used for pesticides it better to focus them flow then having it go all over."
1,Failed Right Away!!,"I agree with the other negative comments. The sprayer did not work correctly when first removed from the box. It took several attempts of connection and disconnection of all parts to finally get it to spray. During my first use, the cheap plastic handle slipped off the valve and continued to do so over and over until the unit became basically unusable. I'll have to find another sprayer to complete the only project I needed this for. I bought this at Agway assuming that it would be of decent quality. Wrong!"
4,"So far, so good.",Quality seems better than what you'd get at Home Depot. I've used it several times and it's yet to crap out on me. Worth the money spent so far.
5,fantastic,"This is a great price for a 1 gallon sprayer. It's light and sprays well. Works inside and outside, love it so far."
4,Sprays well,This came timely and seems to work just fine. Cheaper if bought in store but as I was shopping for spraying items decided to just get it in the same purchase.
5,nice sprayer,as a man of few words i find the minnimum word req quite offensive. ive still got six more words
1,worked well... at first,"I was pretty happy with this sprayer when I bought it last in September. I didn't have any trouble with the canister exploding or anything like that, but it could be due to the fact that It would leak air when I pumped it too much. I probably got 4 or 5 gallons out of it before it started to give me problem. The problem I had was with the trigger and when I would squeeze it nothing would come out. This progressively got worse until nothing would come out, no matter how many times i pumped it. After breaking down the whole nozzle part, it seems that the valve is the part causing all the problems.Bottom Line:If you need a temporary sprayer thats good for 4 or 5 gallon, this would work well. But if you need one that last more than a few months, then stay away from this sprayer."
3,Lawn & garden sprayer,"The Chapin lawn & garden sprayer is easy to use, the control features are well placed and allowed me to spray the entire front, side and backyards of my townhouse with speed and accuracy in under 25 minutes. It's way better than the sprayer the people I brought the house from left me. Plus it's inexpensive to boot. If it had a shoulder strap it would be absolutely perfect."
1,Didn't work out of the box!,"Received this and followed instructions to the letter. My first order of this item. Does not pressurize the container after pumping, in fact, leaks air around top area where supposed to be sealed ... and I have the pumper mechanism fully screwed in. Not sure if it is missing some part during assembly, but based on my experience, I will not buy this item again and will go to another product vendor.I'm really PO'd lately with junk products or ones that come broken. Amazon has been good, but I wonder about the vendors' products and quality anymore."
5,Lightweight and easy to use,"I bought this to spray some herbicide around my yard (nut sedge!). It has more than a gallon capacity, but I was concerned that I'd have difficulty carrying it around or pumping it to build up pressure. It is ergonomic and doesn't pull at your lower back, and priming the pump was a snap (for a nearly 50-year-old woman with a bad back!). I love my little sprayer. It's easy to use and to clean up before putting it away. Terrific design."
2,failed within 20 minutes,I purchased this item because it got excellent reviews. I was very disappointed when the spraying mechanism failed within 20 minutes. I wasn't able to get through my small lawn before I had to rig the mechanism to work. Do not buy this device.
4,Nice sprayer,"Admittedly, this is the first sprayer I have ever purchased. It is easy to set up and works well. It's fairly small and is easy to clean. Only problem I had was in slowly unscrewing the top after I sprayed. Because the pump top was on tight and the unit is so lightweight, I did have to wedge it against another object to hold it in place. I'm also concerned that I eventually may break the plastic handle trying to unscrew it. Good thing I'll only be using it every 3 months to spray insecticide."
3,Good sturdy product,"This 1 gallon size is good, and the price is right within selling range. But, you can save your self some shipping charges and just go to sears or loews and such. If you prefer to order i would suggest getting the 2 gallon size, especialy if your dealing with insecticides. you wont have to refill as often. This is a sturdy little guy though, but be careful with handle.Great product A- but only for size and handel."
3,There is good and bad in everything,"For the price I too was impressed with many of the features of this sprayer: ease of adjusting spray from stream to fan, ease of pumping to get pressure, lightweight tank and ease of filling the tank. That being said, I also had to keep screwing down the cap which anchors the hose to the tank, about every 10 minutes or so, which means that I also had to re-pressurize the tank in order to continue spraying. I also have to keep dettaching and reattaching the sprayer handle itself, the yoke part of the handle which pulls the screw up and allows spraying to continue has partially worn out and so it will slip off of the valve screw frequently.If you are a person who needs just a sprayer occasionally this one should do the job. If you spray more than 2-3 times a year I would recommend a sprayer with with more durable(not plastic) fittings."
5,My Favorite,"I own almost all the Dick Francis books. I wish there was a Dick Francis collection that was available. I am in the process of trying to fill out my collection in ""used"" book stores to acquire the ones that are ""out of print.""I love his characters, although they are basically the same. I love the strong quiet men who always have great values and persevere against evil.Of all of his books, however, I think this is my favorite. I love the fact that the hero is a serious, constructive and committed father. His interactions with his children are fabulous!"
2,"yucky rubbish, but not a complete loss","Slow, yucky in more ways than one, unbelievable, but unpredictable."
2,Cannot get a response from Biddeford,I just purchased a king size blanket with a TC15B2 controller. I too had previously purchased Sunbeam with a lot of problems. I hoped this would be the end of looking for a good electric blanket. I have one side that works great and one controller that flashes the number 8 and the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. Has anyone had any issues like this?
5,Perfect for us.,"We purchased this after our sunbeam started acting funny, flashing control number, had to unplug and plug bach in almost every night. I did a lot of research and the Biddeford got high marks from users. This so far is the best blanket we have had. Would highly recommend this to everybody."
2,"Sigh, I had such high hopes for this","These books could have been wonderful. They could have been great. They could have been just ... okay. Instead they were just plain lousy.The dialog was contrived. Willow did not sound like Willow. As I was reading I kept having to stop myself from throwing the book across the room and screaming ""Willow would not SAY that!"" Same with Giles, and Buffy ... Xander had a few good lines here and there, but for the most part it was just lame.But still, I read on. I had hope that the ending of these books would make up for the rest. Not so. To jump back to the original ending of season 6 after everything that happened in the first 2 1/2 books just makes no sense at all.If you've got serious Buffy withdrawl, it's better than nothing. Otherwise, go write your own Buffy book. It's bound to be better than this one."
1,"As bad as the first two, maybe worse","Now we come to the last book of this unasked for series and what are we left with? Nothing.No really. Same bad plots, same juvenile characterizations of once liked characters. Same ineptitude of Xander, whinny platitudes from Buffy and the rest could have been balled up into just one character for all their blandness. And the same ending from ""Buffy"" the TV show from 2002!In the end I wanted Willow to tell Xander to bugger off and then destroy the world. At least then there would be no more books.This book should actually remove stars from the other two books in terms of ratings.Ms. Navarro once said in an interview she would have liked to bring Tara back. Well she had her chance and blew it.Boring, dull and just plain bad."
4,willow has had enough,"at first willow is distraught that the ghost of tara has left her becasue she thinks that she is the cause. but when she finds out that the scooby gang is responsible, her wrath knows no bounds. the evil plan that she sets into motion for revenge makes the monster of the first 2 books pale in comparison.most people did not like this series. this last book was quite interesting, had more deph and a better monster for willow to release."
5,Great product and a great value,I purchased this for my husband as a gift to go in his 95 Jeep Wrangler and he loves it! Great sound an the lights are a definite plus. And it was easy to install. I would definitively recommend this product and seller.
4,Sound bar NO UPHOLSTRY,this is a great sound bar but it does not have upholstery like it says just hard plastic. buy it
4,Soundbar,Easy to install. Sounds great. Put it in a 2009 jeep wrangler sport. I would recommend this product to anyone not happy with the sound of mfg speakers
4,When a Big Mac just won't do.. A very special cookbook.,"I doubt many folk will buy this book and actually use it. Its great for shock value and as a perfect gift for friends with a slightly warped sense of humor.On the other hand, it might be very useful when the neighbors dog or cat gets really annoying.."
2,30 year old cook book,That's all it is. A 30 year old cookbook. Although the publication is a reprint the statistics are all from 1979 as are the prices. I expected a tour of world cuisine. If it's a cookbook you're after then this is it. Otherwise give it a pass.
5,Love the Hollywood 101 Series!,"My son and I love the Hollywood 101 series! Not only are these books filled with terrific scenes for kids to learn and hone the craft of acting, they also include a ton of practical information for parents, too. For instance, I used to always tell my son to go practice in the mirror--I know now that this was the wrong advice. Buy The Ultimate Commercial Book to learn why. But what I like most about the Hollywood 101 books is how thoroughly encouraging they are. In a business rife with rejection, and often dejection, Chambers Stevens is positively optimistic--yet realistic, too. He calls for hard work, solicits confidence, and makes it all fun in the process. After all, what's more fun for kids than acting out!"
4,Cordless Nailer,"Have had the B&D cordless nailer for eight months now. Sorry the other reviewers have had such problems, but I've had nothing but success. Maybe I got the good one? Anyway I have used it to do all the composite molding in an 800-square-foot addition that we just built on our house. Also have used it to redo all the molding in the mainhallway and entryway, consisting of half-inch hemlock (includes 6 doors). And a couple weeks ago I built a headboard for our bed consisting of plywood back and fir, maple and hemlock. I've had no problem with it sinking brad heads, even in the maple, although I've found that the gun must be completely flush with the surface. I've used it with brads ranging from 5/8"" to 2"". We'll see how the tool works in the long run."
4,Keep it charged,I bought this strictly for quick household DIY projects and the only time I have a problem with jamming is when I use a battery that is not fresh. Since the product comes with two - this isn't really a problem for me.
4,The best tool yet!,"I received this as gift and after using it to attach trim & baseboard, I can't believe it did so well for a cordless nailer. I'm a homeowner, not a contractor so I don't need a huge setup with a compressor etc. This is a great tool because it has lock protection against accidents. You can change nail sizes in less than a minute and work in tight places that make hammering difficult. The only drawback is the availablity of nails - not easily found in the usual places like Home Depot or Lowes."
4,You cannot beat this for the price,"What a great tool for the price. I didn't want something attached to an air compressor because it wou;dn't be a tool I'd use that much. I did molding around two rooms using this with no problems. I never thought DeWalt tools were that good; Milwaukee always seemed the way to go when you truly want a refined yet durable and powerful piece of equipment, but I had to go for this given the price. Nice job overal B&D."
5,the best cordless i ever had,"I HAD THIS CORDLESS FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND KEEPS WORKING LIKE NEW AFTER SOME COUPLE THOUSANDS NAILS, BEFORE THIS I BOUGTH A DEWALT CORDLESS THAT BROKE ON THE FIRST NAIL,NO GOOD FOR A GUN THAT COST 3 TIMES MORE"
4,It is a good option,"this is a single CD have only two tracks: 1. Hold on (Radio Edit), 2. Hold on (Club Edit), it is a good option if you only want this song."
4,Solid Product as advertised,"This is a fine entry level component. Easy to install and set up --- if you have a little experience, 30 minutes. There are many videos online made by bike mechanics to illustrate how to set up."
3,Noisy but does the job,"I have owned 3 air pumps, one being a whisper. This one for sure is louder but more powerful. The kit that comes with it is nice and has everything you need to get started. The whisper broke so I decided to give this a try. Overall it pumps out a lot of oxygen and comes with everything but i can hear it across the room. I have tried on different surfaces and even just holding it in my hand. It might me okay stashed in a cabinet but if you have a silent room you won't miss it. It's hard even to hear the bubbles with it on. I may return this for a refund and try another whisper or a fusion. Good luck."
4,"Incredibly Quiet, Pretty Powerfull","This is the most powerful quiet pump available. Hands down. Now, it's not the most powerfull available, but then again, who wants a turbine running in their house that they have to listen to all day? This pump is plenty powerful (only mildly less than the louder models) and a great choice. Believe me: I've tried them all. Pretty long lasting as well - My last one kicked the bucket after 4 years of hard work."
2,"Awesome content, HORRIBLE production quality","This is a fascinating book on the ""radical"" take on Construction Grammar that Croft has developed. Unfortunately, the quality of the print-on-demand version of this book that I received from Amazon was simply appalling. The cover is low-quality paper, blurry with smeared and dulled colors. The printing inside has such bad resolution that it reminds me of old dot-matrix printers. Boo, Oxford, and shame on you for dropping all quality."
1,Misleading - it is a home video that should have stayed that way,"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. Very little of the actually race was actually shown - possible less than 1 minute... But there was lots of Karen hugging everyone and smoozing.... sorry but that was not what I bought the video for. All the reviews I read were 5 out of 5 stars - definitely misleading - they must have been your family and friends. This DVD should not be for sale on Amazon.com... it is a home video! for your own private gloating and bragging..... Argh. I spent my good money on this video. Please think twice before buying this video (unless you are a family member or friend of Karen - especially one of the many people she hugged on the video) - but in that case, you should get a free copy from Karen.Pretty Sled Dogs"
1,Pretty Sled Dogs,"We purchased this video for family viewing as we studied the Iditarod in our Homeschool studies. The information and video is outstanding - no question. The kids love it. However, if you are purchasing for 'family' viewing please be aware of the following: they refer to a female dog as a 'bitch' lots of times - which is obviously correct, but be prepared if your children are not familiar with the word. Also the vet at one point mentions 'abortion', again understandly from a medical point of view but be prepared for questions if your child has never heard the word abortion; but lastly, and most problematic, there is one point when they are wondering 'how' (of course we all know) the one female dog got pregnant and sort of under the breathe some makes the comment ""that little slut"". Not really what I wanted my 7 and 9 year old girls to hear and completely unnecessary in what is otherwise a great movie about sled dogs and the iditarod."
2,Picture is Not Representative of Product,"The picture for this item is not representative of this product. These knives looked completely different from the website photo - the shape and design were completely different. Additionally, the weight of these knives is not impressive. Sadly, when I tried to return them I was informed this was not Amazon's fault, therefore upon my return I would be responsible for the shipping costs for both the costs of shipping to me (which was originally free with supersaver shipping) and the cost of shipping back to them which amounted to half the price of the product. Needless to say, I won't be buying anything else off amazon unless I've already seen it in person elsewhere."
4,"Not like the photo, but exactly like traditional Beaded Antique","Maybe they're shipping different sets for these knives...? The set I received is the traditional Beaded Antique, very nice quality. The Continental Bead mentioned in the description is a lighter weight knife constucted out of one piece of metal. The knives I received have a heavy handle with the blade (very, very sharp) made of a separate piece of metal cemented into the handle. They don't have a slightly pointed handle - just rounded like the regular Beaded Antique pattern. I'm very pleased with them and will order another set (and hope I get the same ones again!). Not sure why the photo and description are off..."
2,bleh...,very very very cheap quality. get some laguiole knifes if you are on a budget. i tried to be too cheap this time. my mom has some laguiole steak knives that are pretty darn good and i love the fact that they are non-serrated. plus they come with a wooden case as opposed to the cardboard and styrofoam box these came in.
3,Mouthpiece Ok.,"I had tried and really liked a Denis Wick trumpet mouthpiece so I decided to try one with the new Conn Vintage One Flugel that I recently purchased. I was surprised that I had a little difficulty slotting with the new mouthpiece and slurring up cleanly was a challenge. Maybe getting used to it will help, but I'm about to go back to the mouthpiece that came with my horn."
4,"It is a very good book, which caters for young people","The book is about a boy, who is very alone and find some friends. There is an older boy, who always gives him water in his pants. As you reads it is lang time ago I have read the book, but it stands as the best book of my childhood. I just say ""read it"""
4,A Well Done Pictorial Review,"I'm not sure I read the same book as the previous reviewer, and feel compelled to offer a different view.Vanishing Gwinnett is a pictorial history of life and times in Gwinnett County, Georgia, which has evolved to be part of the ever-increasing metropolitan Atlanta area. The book is primarily captioned historical photographs provided by state and local historical groups. Early century Gwinnett industry, families and others pictures of interest are shown. It's a typical local history picture book. Perhaps some would find the included photo of an early 1900's lynching offensive. It's not an attractive part of our past, but is historical nonetheless. Fascism and pro-Nazi beliefs? Sure didn't see any references to any of that in the book I saw.If you have an interest in this areas local history, you will find the book interesting. I don't know the author, but the book is well put together and certainly not slanted in any direction."
5,Amazing software for an amazing price!,"I have had this software now for just about one week. And in that time frame, I have printed and mailed 5 cards (would have cost me $15), custom made 5 envelopes, made return address labels for friends and family, printed out the pre-made paper airplanes for my kids and soooo much more.I can't believe all this program can do right out of the box. I really can't praise this software enough. It has so many different options for cards, notes, labels, door hangers, origami etc. The possibilities are truly endless.The cards look professional, and if you download a UPC font, you can give that card the final ""store bought"" look.You can not go wrong with this purchase if you send cards or have kids. I figure I will this program will pay for itself in about another 2 months with the upcoming holidays and birthdays!I'm printing on a Canon i860 and have to admit that the quality is definitely store bought."
5,wonderful,"i was overly please with the amount of time it was delivered in. i truly needed it, and it came right on time.it was easy to use and i would recommend it to anyone from ages 6-99 years.thanks again for the timely manner that it was sent."
2,Here are the production stills... and a maybe a lame sketch or two,"I was very disappointed when I received this book.It's almost all production stills, they have hardly any developmental art, and what they do show is rather lame story board art.And instead of any sort of explanation for their choices, the making of the film etc. They tell you the plot of the film.It's a children's book, which happens to contain a few story board sketches...As someone who collects 'art of' books for animated films, this is by far and away one of the worst, which was a surprise considering the film itself.I'm a bit afraid to get the large one, for fear I will get nothing but glossy production stills and a few tepid sketches."
1,stolen name or doppleganger,"Hi. I'm Mary Freeman the mystery writer who also writes as Mary Rosenblum. I just want anyone who might be confused to realize that this Mary Freeman author of the Cock of the Wall is not me!Mary Freeman/Mary Rosenblum, Member MWA and SFWA"
3,It's lame to give no credit to the Interviewers.,Did the Editor of this book write the interviews themselves? Or did others write the interviews?Why is there no credit for who did the interview work?
5,simply marvelous,"haven kimmel is an extraordinary author of sublime and rare gifts; now she turns her hand to children's fiction/ as a mother who reads, i humbly submit that Orville is superior to what else is out there. in many cases, young children's books simplify emotions and stay pristine, surreal or silly. this one shines : the impressionistic yet spare illustrations and the bright, funny, often surprising story unfolds like a desert flower. lovely and worth purchasing in bulk so that the next time your child attends a birthday party, you're ready with a gift to cherish and be read time and again."
4,The old Plantronics are better.,"I cant put up the microphone, I use a tie. The microphone and headphone sound quality no are the best comparable with the old Plantronics, like Audio 90.Spanish: No logra aguantar el microfono en su lugar, uso un lazo. La calidad del sonido del microfono y las cornetas no se compara con los viejos Plantronics, como el Audio 90."
1,returned the item,"this is the first time i've tried a headset mic and would probably be the last. the mic did not work as intended. while most peripherals have updated to usb jacks, this one still has the audio and mic function, which means your speakers won't work."
3,"Great sound, poorly made","I have used this item for about 3 weeks now and have to say it both good and bad.The sound is clear and I can find no fault there. The ear cups are also large so to provide plenty of room and not get hot inside due to the open air of them.My problem comes from the microphone. There is no fault in the voice quality, as I have asked people I talk to and they say it is better than my old unit for clarity and no 'tinny' sounds. My problem is that after about 2 weeks, the arm for the mic now drops to straight down. That is to say that the part you talk into is on my shoulder. It is VERY loose, and I had to turn it up every few minutes to have it just drop back down.If this part were to be tightened in future models, or if there was someway to fix the current, I would have gave the unit a 5 for 5!"
4,Mic falls down,"Just like how everyone else warned me in their reviews, mic falls down. Didn't take long for it to start happening either. Headphones are large and make you look silly, but they don't touch your ears and are quite comfortable. Cord is nice and long."
4,Good Product. Great Value. Great Sound. What Else?,"While currently listening to the headphones listed above I can truely say that they are worth the money. In fact, the price is one of the reasons to get these.The sound from them is crisp and clean. The bass is a little low for me, but on the other hand I play the bass and if it's not shaking the house it's too low for me. :) The headset works great in games with the crisp sound.The microphone hasn't let me down yet. I chat online and the people I talk to say that I am clear and easliy understood. So no complaints there.These headphones are a keeper. They sound great. The microphone is clear. They are comfortable. Good buy."
3,Microphone Issues,"The headset is very comfortable and the sound quality is great. The clarity of the mic is not the problem but the boom and volume are.The company boasts that the headset has an extendable boom. What they don't tell you is that it is only another half inch of movement which is quite useless. That said, you can't get the microphone close enough to your mouth so that it receives enough db to transmit at a proper volume.I have adjusted all sound settings, put on mic boost, etc. and it simply will not transmit loudly enough to anyone in Ventrilo, Skype or other recording software.I replaced it with a $12 cheap headset which is doing the job of this $50 headset."
2,The cover is the best part,"Someone should do a decent book on Maximalism. The trend has already peaked and it is time for an overview. Sadly, this book isn't it. There is precious little text. There are no obvious references to artists nor a sense of obvious organization. Even the ""curatorial"" choices are poor. It strikes me as an entrepreneurial exercise. Someone got some images, crammed them together and went to press. It's really too bad..."
5,minimalist is out,"a non-artist can accidentally make a minimalist design look good. there's no way you can make something with this ""maximalist"" style look good accidentally. this book is an example of good art. a nice addition to your collection. remember, you get better with every piece of art you appreciate."
4,Inspiring,"This book is very very interesting to say the least. I think it belongs in every designers library. While the examples in the book aren't very practical (if you freelance or work for a normal ad agency this stuff wont fly), they are inspiring, and very beautiful (most of them)."
5,Great Book Series For Kids,"I bought a bunch of the books from this Horrible Harry series, for a friend's 8 year old daughter who was exposed to them at her school. She loves every one of them & was super excited to get these books from us!"
1,BioSafe Thyroid Test,"WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS TEST. I bought this test and sent it to BioSafe in their packaging and it was ""lost in the mail"". They sent me a second test which was also ""delayed"" in transit. When they finally located it and sent me the results, they were completely wrong. I had a proper blood test done though my doctor and it showed my TSH level at 6.2, not the 2.5 reported on the BioSafe results. I feel ripped off. Either the test sample deteriorated because it took so long for them to receive it or the test itself is not accurate."
1,"OK Product, Poor Customer Service","I have used Biosafe's home tests a number of times. I've had to repeat the tests a few times--their explanation was not enough blood was given the first time. I can accept this. What I cannot accept is the ""customer-service-with-an-attitude"" that I received with every dealing with the company on the phone. They are defensive and reactive with every query. I still have not received by mail my test results which they say were completed two weeks ago. When I called to query the delay I had to put up with a harangue. If a product is not backed up with good customer service, then one should look elsewhere."
4,Good product,The TSH test kit was easy to use and the steps were easy to follow. I had problems with the needle device in that the prick to my finger was too small and I couldn't get even one drop of blood to come out. I called the number listed for help and they sent me a bigger needle in which I had no problems. The results came back within a week.
2,Disappointed,"This product actually has a pretty easy follow along manual that I was impressed with. The finger prick was my biggest fear and that too was nothing to worry about. The problem came with the actual blood collection device. The manual doesn't give an estimate on how long the blood takes to absorb and the ""finished"" indicator to turn red. So after filling the whole fill port with blood - which took a couple of finger pricks, I came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with my blood collector. I called the 1-800 number but found it was a disconnected number. The website isn't much help either with the website copyrighted to 2007.No ""how to contact us"" with a valid phone number. I sterilized a pin as best as I could and tried to unplug the collector hole. The viewer window turned a dark pink but I'm afraid the sample won't be good enough to test properly. I won't buy this product again. The invalid phone number was a big mistake on their part!"
3,I must not bleed well enough,It's rather hard sometimes even to get the few drops of blood you need with the included lancets. I have some syringes in the house which I use to prick my finger and get enough blood. The results are fairly accurate... it was a big help when the lab my doctor uses made a big goof and my doctor wanted me to reduce my medication as a result.
4,"Good, but better lancets needed",It is a Good and very handy test. Problem is the lancets and it takes 7 days minimum to get the Results. Lancets is a big problem though.
5,Book is in print!,"Not An Easy Target is in print again. The publishers are printing it on demand. Don't hesitate to order it. Thanks, Paxton Quigley"
2,Mostly about defense without using a gun.,I was disappointed because I was looking for information about defense using a gun. This book says little about self defense using a gun. It is mostly about other forms of defense not using a gun. If that is what you are looking for it is a ok book.
2,Product Killed Some of My Fish,"This product applied according to instructions, 25 drops/ten gallons or 40 liters of water, killed all of my blue eye forktail rainbow fish, Pseudomugil furcatus, within 18 hours, first the females and then the males. None of my other fish, primarily three species of tetras, have been affected. However, I have not lost any plants to the product. The product is fairly effective against algae, but after the initial kill, it is necessary to continue treating the water weekly."
2,Didn't notice a difference in algae,"I noticed algae growing on my gravel & plants in my 10-gallon aquarium. I read the reviews on this product & purchased it, because apparantly this has helped some people with algae on gravel. Well, I used the item as instructed & nothing changed. After two weeks of working with the product I did what I should have done from the beginning: emptied my aquarium & scrubbed the gravel myself.All in all this did nothing to help clear algae from my tank."
1,Kills algae AND plants,"Front of bottle says, ""Will not harm fish or plants"". It wasn't killing the algae so I used a little more. It killed all the algae and all the plants. There is no caution statement about this that I could find anywhere on the bottle. Really bad product."
5,Excellent work by a strong new fiction voice,"I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. Schaap has given us one of the finer reads in inspirational fiction. In terms of quality, voice, style, and most of all, story, this novel stands leagues above many others that have garnered far more attention and plaudits in the ""Christian fiction"" category. In addition, his own Christian worldview shines through without hitting his readers over the head with the more common tactic of ""sermonizing."" It's too bad this novel hasn't received the recognition it so obviously deserves.I applaud the book and look forward to the author's next work."
5,An all-time favorite!,"I have almost all of Kate & Jody's CD's, but this is the one I keep coming back to. I LOVE it !!!! For the choice of songs, as well as for Jody's brilliant musianship and for Kate's angel voice."
1,Not good,The power is there if you work on it. The drill will slip a lot causing damage to the drill bits.The craftman drill has 850 torque but does not slip.The Black and Decker one is not a good tool to own even for the cheap price.
3,Well enough...,"It works well enough. Used it to build my fence. Drove 3"" deck screws through the 2x4's and into the post really easily. Only complaint is the battery life. Both fully charged batteries will only drive about 80 screws. I also tried to drive some six inch lag screws and both fully charged batteries only did about 6. But hey... if you got the time, it sure beats doing it by hand..."
3,One Great Impact,"I own this little guy along with a Makita 14.4 impact, and a Hitachi 18v Li-on impact, I love this drill for it's simple power, and weight, However the only drawback from this drill is it's batteries.It has the best power to weight ratio of all 3 items I own, but the batteries can't hold up for more than 25 - 35 minutes of continuous use. I have 2 batteries and a very flimsy charger that came with it, and it takes 3 hours to charge the batteries. I have seen online that you can buy aftermarket 2.6 amphour batteries for this drill but the cost to get 2 of them and a smart charger is more than what I paid for the whole tool.If you only drill a few small holes, or a few screws around the home than this would work for you, but if try to build a deck or work bench, you will not like this tool, or should I say the battery life. do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks and go with Makita, or Hitachi, the two I own can drill 3"" tin screws all day on one charge."
5,When Katie Wakes,"Connie May Fowler's memoir of how she endured and escaped domestic violence is brutally honest and well-written. I could not lay down this book; it is compelling to the last word. Fowler lets the reader take a ride in her mind in a kind of you-are-there recounting of her childhood experience living in a violent household and of her gradual realization that she no longer has to serve the violent narcissist with whom she lives. This is an amazing book. The rest of her books are fiction and they are wonderful, too."
4,Ecellent book,I used this book as a reference for a om line Marine Electrical course I am taking and it was excellent.
3,Disregards Best Practices Regarding Lightning Protection,"The author's suggestion that the lightning grounding system and the electrical grounding system be separated from each-other is very surprising considering that this practice is in direct contradiction with the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) and research regarding lightning protection in boats. To the authors credit, the fact that his recommendation contradicts the ABYC recommendations is clearly noted in the book.One good place to start for the theory and practice of lightning protection for boats is the work done by Ewen M. Thomson, much of which is available on the internet."
3,Takes a while to get going....but good overall,I actually like the sequel better than this book. THis book is very front heavy with character development and some level of detai that doesnt really add to the back end of the story. But it does show the bond of true friendship between the boys.I like the way the sequel wraps back around to this story.
3,so good ?,"Well after having read all those reviews i must say that i do not really agree whith what has been said. The fact that Simmons is a literary genius is a fact that noone can deny. Nevertheless, summer of night is not his best book in many aspects. Not having enough space to widen my opinion, il just mention the end of the book, which is rather hasty and really""american"". The plot is also a bit simple with that story of the Borgia's bell connected with... egyptian mithology ! No, no, if you really want to discover Simmons at his best, read lovedeath or song of kali which are far more interesting and less commercially oriented !"
4,Waiting for the movie!,"This book is touching, nostalgic, humorous, intelligent, and frightening. Well, maybe the ""monster"" here is not quite that scary (if you're past puberty) and the ending is a little anti-climactic.. but if you can put yourself in the shoes of these kids ( a group remniscient of the kids in King's It or The Body), you can feel their fear and experience the struggles of the kids. The characters are diverse and many humorous, and if you have relatives from small towns, you could even recognize your town here.. the picture woven by Simmons is very vivid. Great book, ought to be a great movie."
4,Summer of Night,"I've never read a Dan Simmons book that wasn't good, Summer of Night is no exception. Read Hyperion, Endymion, Ilium and Olympus."
2,Attack of the Killer Lampreys?,"What could have been a killer ""coming-of-age"" thriller was nothing more than a ""B"" movie with a weak plot. Why do horror writers keep rehashing the same themes over and over with no freshness. (Haunted schools, cursed objects, and burrowing creatures of unspeakable horror that take over the bodies of dead people) It's all been done before. If only writers like Simmons would explain the circumstances behind the supernatural occurrences rather than letting them just happen, leaving us to scratch our heads and go, ""What?"" Keep digging Dan. It's been said, ""There's nothing new under the sun"" but let's keep trying, shall we?"
4,It took me back to when...,"we were young and had summers off. There were adventures everyday, although not all were quite like this, thank God. I was looking for a different author to read and I found this treasure. It was good reading from the start. It held my interest through the whole thing. With some authors I end up skipping paragraphs while they drone on about inconsequential details. Summer of Night - I read every word!! I can't wait to read the next one, A Winter Haunting."
4,Summer of Night,I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It starts off a little slow but the characters are so life like that I found myself wanting everyone to survive the malevolence. His isn't as good as Black Hills but it's a close 2nd.
5,Dan Simmon's best,"Dan Simmons has made a lot of bizarre writing choices lately (the spirit of Custer entering a Native American's body?), but this novel from the early '90s stand as his best novel. He truly captured the wonder of childhood and turned it upside down. I couldn't put this book down. I would also recommend ""A Winter's Haunting,"" which is a sequel that involves the main character from ""Summer of Night"" as an adult. It's interesting to compare the tense, edge-of-your-seat writing style of these two novels to some of his more verbose works. For instance, I enjoyed ""The Terror,"" but it seemed to go on for about 200 pages more than it needed to, and the ending was more a dwindling of the story rather than a climax."
4,Summer Of Night,"Summer of NightDan Simmons novel takes us to a small midwestern town nestled in the cornfields of southern Illinois. A group of young boys are confronted by the darkest of evils and not only of the supernatural kind.A coming of age novel; yes, but also a good horror yarn which manages to combine things that go bump in the night with the monster that lives in every young child's closet, and the evil that lurks beneath every child's bed.This novel does have its flaws; once or twice I was left scratching my head and asking out loud "" How can that happen?"" However I would quickly conclude that this is speculative fiction and continue reading allowing myself to enjoy the book for what it is: good clean fun!"
1,"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice.....","The scariest thing about this book is that it made its way through the editors with about 50% fluff.Dan Simmons did it to me again. I had read Hyperion earlier this year, and was extremely disappointed by the same thing: he loves to write and write and write, but the plot is lost in the writing.More exchange is needed in this book by the characters, it seems to be about 50 paragraphs of description, then some action, then another 50 paragraps of description, ad nauseum.I was fooled once by Simmons, and I'll never read him again.The only positive thing about this book is that it does help you fall asleep quickly."
3,Great Story... But about 200 pages too long,"From Joe Shrader, author of the Action/Thriller novel ""Eden Falls.""I was torn between a 2 and 3 star rating for one reason - over description. Now before everyone starts screaming boo to that statement let me clear the air by saying proper description is necessary, but it often times can be taken too far. Such is the case here. ""Summer of Night"" is a great story and Mr Simmons portrays the young characters as if he is actually a pre-teen boy himself with a knack for writing. The action and horror kept me tense when it was on the page but then took a long time to reappear with unnecessary descriptive paragraphs that did not hinge to the story. All in all I would recommend this novel for anyone looking for a good coming of age scare but a great deal of patience is required."
4,3.5 stars is more fitting for a not so scary read,"This book of Simmons comes highly touted as one the greats in the horror genre. However, the only scary parts are found in midway through the 600 page novel. Once the story really gets descriptive about what's taking place in this small town, it becomes too unbelievable and unsatisfying. I do agree that the way Simmons writes (elogantly and almost poetically at times) makes this book a good read. However if you're looking for a book to scare the heck out of you look elsewhere. I would recommend Ketchum's older works, SK's Pet Semetary and the Shining, and Laymon's The Woods are Dark."
4,Excellent Book,"The story is well done and the writing is beautiful. Descriptions of the characters and the locations are masterfully written,and are of a much higher quality than your usual horror novel."
2,Is this the same Dan Simmons that wrote Hyperion?,"After reading the Hyperion series, which I found to be maybe the best SF books I had ever read, I jumped on this book when I found it on a shelf. What a disappointment! It was the silliest story I had read in a long time, only worth of the cheapest b-movie.I find it hard to believe that someone with the talent shown by Dan Simmons in the Hyperion series can write rubbish like this."
5,The best horror writer today...period.,"Dan Simmons is, without a doubt, the best horror writer working right now, and this is his finest work. The writing and story are beautiful and nostalgic one minute, suspenseful and horrifying the next. I could not put this book down. Read this book. Read everything simmons has written, especially his Hyperion novels, which rank as some of the best science fiction ever written. Stephen King has said that he is in awe of Dan Simmons. I know just how he feels."
4,Summer of Night in 4 Nights,"I picked Summer of Night up at a garage sale for a dime. All I wanted was a little entertainment to fill in the week before school started. What better than a book about a haunted school? On the cover Stephen King called it a ""must read"" book. After one chapter the reason was obvious. Summer of Night is the characters from ""The Body"" (Stand By Me) fighting the evil from IT. Regardless of the similarities, I had nightmares for two nights, compelling me to read the 600 pages in about 4 nights. As another reviewer pointed out and I agree, the wrap up was sappy. But, as I turn out the lights tonight, I may appreciate that often scoffed literary strategy. Very Scary. Read it."
3,Slow Moving; Badly Needs an Editor,"I almost give this book two stars, but the writing and prose are very well done at moments in the novel (not the entire time, though). This is not a page-turner, and I am disappointed by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews that name it such. This novel should be about 300 - 340 pages long; it needs that much editing. I really wanted to like this book, but the pacing is way too slow. Honestly, it is not a scary or mysterious book either. If you want something along this theme to read that is compelling, read McCammon's Boy's Life or King's It -- two far better books."
3,It's okay,"As a teen, I found this novel engaging and terrifying. Suddenly I was hearing sounds in the dark as I walked home from my friends houses. I kept it in my mind as a favoriteReading it as an adult, I find it much too unbelievable. I'm now quite over the entire concept of plucky children that save the day while oblivious adults don't hear bells ringing in the night, see giant rending trucks plough through town at odd hours, or notice the strange ghostly shapes trying to break into their homes. Really? You didn't notice all that going on? The children are too mature for their ages and the adults too immature.I also have serious issue with the way Dwayne and his father are written. It's pretentious. He has an answering machine and thinks computers are the future? Sure he does. Dwayne is still an 8yr old boy. He'd spend more time in trees and a lot less time contemplating Faust."
4,WOW!! Serious page turner!!!,"A creepy, scary, fear inducing, terror filled ride - Summer of Night is a great read for anyone who loves their horror!!!! Simmons does a great job of introducing all the main characters and ratcheting up the suspense with each page. I love the scenes where all the boys are hanging out together and acting just like ""boys enjoying the summer"", but I was quite shocked and upset at the death of my favorite...Great novel - I just listened to Mr. Simmons speak and he's a very down to earth, funny ""superstar author!! and I bought Carrion Comfort and Song of Kali - all classics by Simmons that I can't wait to read!!"
3,I had so much hope for this one,"SUMMER is not a bad story. I had trouble staying with it. At first I thought it was because I had recently read King's IT, and the stories are similar in some ways, but when I resumed it a year later and finished it, I realized that it is just a slow and uneventful book for the most part. It's a good premise, it's coming-of-age, it's unconventional horror, and all of these are good things. The real problem here is that it's 400 pages of book streched to 600 pages. If you're patient and like to spend a lot of time with your charaters outside the main plot, then I would say, you wouldn't be worse off for reading this one. It just seemed like it was going to be much better."
4,This one is a reader.,"A good book. I am more of a suspenseful, physcological thriller reader, than a boogie man reader, but otherwise this was very good. The character developement was very good, and it felt as though I was right there in the town with them. As a person who grew up in that era-it was very believable. Without being a spoiler, the ending was a bit far out there-but all and all-I would recommend this to the next reader."
1,AWFUL,It's starts out pretty good - creepy - but the best character dies and it goes do hill fast after that - a waste of my time and money.
2,"no original packaging, no original manual","This watch is cheap, and you get what you pay for. Cheap plastic casing, not steel. No mineral crystal but, yes you guessed it: plastic."
4,Good watch for the price,"I am happy with this watch. Set up is a bit confusing but I was expecting this, thanks to other reviews, and did not have too much trouble.Pros: Accuracy. Looks nice. There are a lot of things I like about it but they are mostly personal preferences: Has Arabic numerals, a second hand, minute hash marks, twenty-four hour markings, water proof to 50 meters.Cons: At certain places along the dial the minute hand does not line up right on the hash mark when it is zero seconds after the hour.The hands are luminescent but it is very weak, although I have been able to tell the time with them when in bed for the night. The numerals are even weaker. They glow for a few seconds and then dim from view.The manual does not go into enough details in some sections.I didn't care much for the leather band, but that is just another personal preference, as it is of good quality."
3,Waveceptor Watch,A little complicated to set. Would also be better if it self corrected when moving from one time zone to another and when changing to daylight saving time. I don't do this often and have to get the book out each time.
4,Cute,"Those are cute. I wish they were bigger, but for the price, I'd get them again. The shipping cost a lot though for something so light."
2,Kraftwerk gone industrial,"In three words: Kraftwerk gone industrial. The tinny beats, wispy melodies, and vocoders are all here, just with a darker edge. One can't deny the quality of the production - it's tight, minimal, and *very* German. But unlike Kraftwerk's doe-eyed futurism, which concealed a throbbing sexuality, the attempts at menace here feel calculated and fall flat. The album succeeds most when it stops trying to frown; highlights include the playful title track and the charming ""Heimcomputer."" This disc is basically a 10-track album; tacked on at the end are six tracks of ""other stuff,"" including hit-or-miss remixes by luminaries such as Wumpscut and the Suicide Commandos, and two long ambient tracks. Maybe inside those goth lunchboxes lurk some pocket calculators..."
1,UNREAL,Spotted a customer with this one. Couldn't believe the price tag on it. Sure hope it holds up for this amount of money.
4,Very Satisfied,The instalation directions need to be followed carefully. The cover fits tightly and is exactly the same as the original. I'm ordering another one just in case this line is ever discontinued.
4,Iron,This iron is a great product it is easy to use and very good value this is our second one off this model my wife lady the other one on flat down and melted the board to it stupid woman :-)
2,Great.. If you don't mind spending $10 on batteries every month.,"I got this remote thinking it would be great for my wireless music setup that I achieved with my stereo hooked up to my Airport (then wirelessly to my laptop), and it was, until I started replacing batteries every month and leaving the store thinking, ""Did I even spend this much on the actual remote control?"" It's since ended up in the bottom of my remote control box (yes people, hide them when you're not using them...they're ugly!) and it's small enough that it'll never be heard from again."
3,No Vista support?,"Worked great with iTunes on my XP PC, to control through my airport express. Updated(?) my PC to Vista and it no longer works. Seems to be incompatible with Vista. Sigh."
1,"Okay for iTunes, not okay for much else","I purchased this remote for use with some research software I run on a Windows XP machine. The software seemed to allow one to map individual keys on the remote to match the research software, but this never actually worked at all. I found the software to be cumbersome and not user friendly. I did test the remote with iTunes and it worked fine with that, but $60 for an iTunes remote? I returned the remote and since have purchased a unit from Interlink (more money, but actually works as advertised...)."
1,Doesn't work with OS 10.5,The Remote only works through 10.4 and the packaging is misleading. I had to send an email to customer support to find out the problem. Now I have the headache of returning the item.
5,A snap to set up and easy to use!,"I took the Keyspan remote out of the box and was set up and using it within 5 minutes. I'm streaming music wirelessly via itunes and an airport express. The Keyspan remote is connected via usb to the airport express, enabling me to remotely control the music on my PC."
2,Works but EATS batteries!!,"I bought this remote several months ago and it works as advertised and was easy to setup and use. One complaint I have about is it EATS batteries when not in use. The batteries that came with it were dead within a couple of weeks. I purchased more and they too went dead in a couple of weeks. I don't use it all that often and store it in the receiver as shown in the pictures. Emails for support request to the manufacturer went un-answered. So, all in all, I would say stay away from this item. Not worth the money wasted on changing the batteries in the remote."
5,Recommended,"I've had this for two years. Using with Winamp, ATI Multimedia Center (TV tuner software), and other media players on Windows XP. The software can be cumbersome to set up for each program you use, but having the ability to customize for any program that uses the keyboard to execute commands, it's worth it. Also have used it with PowerPoint presentations.If you want to transfer your settings to another PC, you can copy the install folder from ""C:\Program Files\Keyspan"" to your new computer, then reinstall the software.The keymapper uses about 4MB memory. The remote's battery lasts me about a year with daily use, and are $2 to replace."
4,You (and I mean you) win with this one.,"Blessed with one of the most heart wrenchingly beautiful songs I've heard in a while (The Rejection Letter) this album is full of wonderfully evocative lyrics set to very nice, quiet, hooky tunes. This is one that grew on me. I didn't really appreciate it after the first play but decided to que it up while I did a bit of woodworking in the shop. The quiet, contemplative songs wormed their way into my head while I was hand planing a craftsman light and it all just seemed perfect. This is one that will be at the top of the stack for a while...at least until I get their other release: ""Fair Store"".This is a good one. Don't miss it."
4,Good book,"I liked this book very much and found it to be the only one worth reading in the trilogy. It is credible and offers a window onto a conservative Egyptian family at the turn of the century. The second book is really just a prelude to the third as the last few chapters inartfully divulge -- they do not say, but might as well say ""To Be Continued."" The last book in the trilogy ""Sugar Street"" contains so much tragedy as to be truly lacking in believability. ""Palace Walk"" should be considered a stand-along good read, as the other 2 books are not worth your while."
4,Palace Walk,"Book in nice condition, did take a long time to get here, but otherwise satisfactory service."
3,Intricate characters but repetitious,"This book is filled with fascinating characters and is definitely worth reading. However, if you have a short attention span like me, you will get frustrated with the repetitions of the characters' traits and appearance. I am glad I read this book, but there were times when I felt like I was slogging through. Being a woman, I found the attitudes of the men in this book to the various ""classes"" of women to be quite eye opening; I thought all women were treated roughly the same way in strict Muslim societies."
2,No PLOT,"This book was extremely well written with an intricate use of vocabulary. However, it lacked a plot. The author seemed to forget to include a beginning, middle, and end. It was written somewhat like a soap opera, where the author allows the reader a glimpse into the INDIVIDUAL lives and thoughts of each separate character. There were a few parts that grabbed the reader's attention, but most of the book seemed to drag and be very repetitious."
5,"I have traveled to Cairo, and never left my home,facinating!","As I read this book, I became familar with the area and the family. I liked them both very much!I was enlighted to a culture that is very much different from my own. I commend Naguib Mahfouz forhis wonderful storytelling gift. Anyone who would like to travel to another place and time shouldcuddle up with this book, and go to Cairo in their mind. I just ordered (Cairo Trilogy II) andanxiously await my next trip!"
5,The Fantasy Of Mahfouz,"Palace walk is one of my favourate novel i ever red, if you want to know how the triditional life was after the World War II , then this book would be ideal for you, it also describes the drmmatic changes an Egyptian family had to go through at this time. Beautifully structured."
2,"Sorry, too wordy for me","I am sure this is an amazing book, and I am just some kind of short attention span, shallow person. Was just too wordy for me! I loved how you got introduced into the culture and political situation, but I guess I need more action, or more passion. Every time I turned the page, they're back on their cushions, drinking coffee, exchanging pleasantries!The other thing I wondered about: I don't think this book really represents a female angle (well, it's written by a man). These women are just too happy to marry strangers & bob around in their houses behind lattice-covered windows. No complaints? Ever? Only bowed heads & apologies? Again, maybe I'm too far removed to be able to imagine that.Read it; it comes highly recommended - above are just my thoughts. And hey, it's a trilogy: read ""Palace Walk"". If you like it, you got 2 more books to look forward to! If not, put it away & know you didn't miss out on anything."
4,A delightful mixture of both learning and entertainment.,"Although this book starts out a bit slow, I found that it is a mixture of a text book and novel. I was enlightened about the Western culture as well as some religous aspects of the Moslem faith and the Quran. I will definately read the balance of the trilogy because this first piece left me in suspense.I recommend this book to any literature class or reading group. Endless converstation pieces are presented here with the multitude of topics in the book."
2,Stylistically intolerable for me,"I understand others' comments about ""culture shock"" and related issues, but I simply cannot enjoy this novel due to its style of naive, florid hyperbole. This may be due to the translation, but as an American reader, I find myself unable to stomach such passages as: ""He nourished his eyes and spirit with glimpses of her face. Even though the looks were furtive and fleeting, they took control of his spirit and senses. [...] They were like a burst of lightning glowing for a brief moment, its flash illuminating vast expanses and dazzling the eyes. His heart was drunk with a mysterious and intoxicating joy..."" or sentences like: ""His concern was quickly transmitted to her sensitive soul.""The whole book reads like this. Is this a result of the translation? Are Arabic writing styles so different from what is typically accepted in English writing? Or is it just me? Email feedback would be welcome."
3,Palace Walk,I was disappointed in this purchase. It was described as New. The cover was folded and the pages were yellowed. Would have preferred a more honest description of it's condition.
3,Long and drawn out story,"I only finished this book because I had chosen it for my book club, based on all the wonderful reviews it had received. It was a painful and long read though--and the lives of the women were so depressing, which made it even tougher going. I must be fair though--out of the four members of the book club, two loved it, while two of us didn't like it at all."
3,Could have been so much more!,"Is it entertaining? Well. Yes - but I'd qualify that with the note that it is somewhat boring. It mostly consists of viewing him at his house in Russia (summer house I think) and that's pretty much it. I was hoping that it would include a lot more about the Caps and the way he interacts with other players. A team view with a focus on what he means individually to that team. Interviews with more Caps players and others. While some things were included it mostly had the flavor of ""here's where he grew up and what it was like"".I am a huge Caps fan - and though I did enjoy this it was not what I had hoped it would be. If I'm judging fairly I'd say it was o.k. (hence the 3 stars) but the potential for a 5 star DVD was entirely missed. It's too bad really."
5,This was a requested gift,My friend is a fan of Alex Ovechkin and requested this DVD as a gift. It arrived promptly and my friend says it was very interesting.
1,Collectors Guide to Wagner Ware and Other Companies with Prices,Save your money. This book has almost no information in it. The book contains only pictures with few dates and some old prices which don't take into consideration the condition of the item. It is very incomplete. I have a dozen Wagner skillets and couldn't find any meaningful mention of them in this book. I wanted to learn about the products that Wagner produced and when each series was manufactured. This book doesn't have any of that information in it. I hope I can find a book that does! Anybody want a used book for half off?
1,WORST MACHINE MADE!,"Singer should know that they scared away a lot of customers by having such an inadequate ""top of the line"" machine. This is a worthless piece of trash. I tried 4 different machines, returning each time because of various problems. I am very experienced in embroidery and this machine is more frustrating than useful. Save your money, this one is way over-priced! I wouldn't give $100 for one! BUT, if you insist on buying Singer, the company that is not what is used to be) then by all means join FuturaEmbroidery yahoo group. Save yourself a headache because this machine is discontinued and no dealer will support it!"
3,Lamentablemente estan decayendo,"Es una música demasiado tradicional y común, aunque siguen con el virtuosismo instumental, lo están desperdiciando haciendo esa clase de música."
5,this is excellent,"This picture is excellent! You can see the strokes of oil pencil in it, even though it is a copy. My husband is an artist and he is equally impressed how nice it is. Note: the framable portion is 14x11, the actual picture is smaller than I imagined because there is a white border of around 1 1/2 inches around the photo. The white border makes it frame ready though!"
5,"beautiful sound, beautifully packaged","This windchime was so beautifully and carefully packaged, wrapped in paper and enclosed in a heavy outer wrap with label and tag.The sound of this windchime is incredible, beautiful, I just love it. It looks pretty hanging under my tree in the garden. Even the wood on the top of the windchime is rustic. Every leaf was wrapped in foam in the package, it was so protected. It would make a marvelous gift, -- in presentation, packaging, appearance and sound. I highy recommend it. Probably everything Caramba makes will be like this. It is from Peru, a plus,--- makes it more interesting!"
3,Don't be blind to critics,"This is a great album. But not the greatest.Don't believe all these critics. If you listen closely, you will see how the drummer destroyed Evans' music. He ain't nothing but a sad drummer.Good to have this album, but try Evans' later years.......Just who is that praising this CD too much under me? Seems to be a foreign student. Learn to listen! There are a lot better music."
5,Impeccable of course,"Bill Evans was an early jazz idol of mine. This is a classic album:if style,sophistication, and elegance are to your taste this is a must."
5,Beyond category,"Most of Bill Evans' work is great and timeless. Much of it, like this record, transcends jazz or any other stylistic category. It is simply gorgeous, intelligent music. As some writers have said, he seemed to distill beauty and nostalgia out of thin air."
1,An unsuccessful gift,I'm a New Agey type of person and am not averse to the idea of decorating my lawn. But this was not to my taste. Plus I don't think it will stand up to a storm.
4,Good stand Poor shipping,"The stand is good looking and easy to put together. However, the first one shipped from Amazon was broken and had to be returned. Shipper charged me $10 for return of item"
5,Cool Item!,I found that ordering from Amazon and receiving the item of the Immortal Spiderman T-shirt was in excellent condition. Thanks for your services. I would recommend others to buy the t-shirt. It is very detailed the drawing and the paint job was superb!
4,good for you,Snaps on and stays on. Should have been sold with the container when I bought that at Lowes.. They sold it with an inferior plastic lid that cracked after a few months. One Problem: the flat surface allows rain water to collect.
4,Top of the Garbage,I found a lost garbage can on the side of the road. I need a top or lid. It was what I needed.
2,Hard to Hook,I found this clip to be a little hard to get to hook onto my belt. They should have made the bend in the outer part a little more and the difference in length of the two parts a little more.
2,Not very well done.,"I was able to borrow this video and the companion ""advanced"" video from my library. Neither video is particularly well done, and there are only a couple of interesting drills in the advanced video. Many of the people demonstrating the drills in the video are beginners and I found watching them make mistakes to be a bit distracting. This video might be good for someone who has never played and just wants some very basic drills to try. For those who are more serious I'd look into one of the Wiel Coerver videos."
5,Fun for little trainers too!,"If you have a Pokemon-crazy kid between preschool and second grade, a dust-collecting original Memory game, and a nearby Pokemon retailer, then this game was made just for you and your kids! Bored with matching pictures of apples, rocking horses, airplanes and other everyday objects? Tell the kids they're going on a Pokemon journey and Professor Oak (you) wants them to catch two of all the Pokemon in the game. Then send them off to search for Yadoking, Elekid, Pikachu and the others, and try to remember where you saw them so you can go back and catch them. They like it when you play it like on TV or in the video game. My only complaint is the plastic tray, which can make it harder for little fingers to lift up the tokens. I usually play without it."
2,Dense and Not User Friendly,"While it seems heretical to give such a low review to a classic book, I did not find this a good choice for canning/preserving reference. It has plenty of variety, but the material is extremely dense and hard to follow. Recipes are written in block paragraphs instead of steps, with ingredients and amounts in bolded type embedded in the body of the recipe rather than cleanly listed up front. Plenty of information but not user friendly at all."
3,An epilogue would have improved the book,"Loved Cal, the hero of the book. So loving and caring. We read about his struggles with PTSD, and his struggle with getting over (or not) his one and only true love.Laurie was not so easy to love. In fact, I was was pretty indifferent toward her from beginning to end. Although she did finally realize what was truly important in life, she took us on an adventure to get there.The story had potential. But it somehow missed the mark, at least it did for me. I never felt a connection between Laurie and Cal. It was just a ""story"" rather than something I felt part of. An epilogue would have improved my over all opinion of the book. Although there was a happily-ever-after ending, a glimpse into the future would have pushed the rating up.This was one of the authors older books. Her wringing style has, in my opinion, improved tremendously over the years. If this was your first book by this author, read some of her newer books. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,Too much regret,"I regret reading this book. It is not horrible, for it does has areas where there is/was promise, but I found the book and the premise especially simple and not challenging enough. I came away disappointed and empty from this novel that was mostly empty although it came with a promising intent."
4,4 Star Effort,"Jordan Blake was infuriating @ times with his controlling ways and seemed a bit more Italian than black. I loved the way he spoke Italian and called Macy ""Bella"". The book had great sex scenes and you always got the feeling that Jordan and Macy really loved each other despite everything that was going on. Quick,great read that I'd recommend to anyone."
2,another ok read,The book starts off interesting enoughI was immediately turned on by Jordan's take charge attitudebut everything just moved too quick after there meetingand as the book wore on I began to not care for Macy too much.The fact that she gets kidnapped in the story and is fearingfor her life and she tells the kidnapper that its 'not very hospitable of you'---jordan of course saves her in a non descriptive way that seemedlike a cop out for the writer to lazy out of writing it.the descriptions of italy are very cold like something takenverbatum out of a travel magazine and dont flow with the rest of her book if you want a quick read with a foreign male characteras your i/r lead try and get your hands on a copy of delaney'sdesert sheik its short but really good
4,Casio Waveceptor Atomic Watch,"I like my new watch. It keeps absolutely accurate time. The instruction book is small and hard to read but got me to the right place. We travel so move between time zones. That's not real handy with an Atomic Watch, especially if you leave the booklet at home. It is a wonderful buy at less than $40. The band and bezel are good and durable stainless steel. Buy one if you want to deal with the details of an Atomic Watch."
5,"Casio Wave Ceptor Atomic Timekeeping Watch, WVQ201HDA-8AV",I like the watch very much. It is exactly what I expected it to be
2,Deadly to Some Fish,"This product, applied according to instructions (25 drops/ten gallons or 40 liters of water, killed all of my blue eye forktail rainbow fish, Pseudomugil furcatus, within 18 hours, first the females and then the males. None of my other fish have been affected. However, I have not lost any plants to the product. The product is fairly effective against algae, but after the initial kill, it is necessary to continue treating the water weekly."
1,Cannot control brown algae,"I bought this product about 1 month ago, because my fish tank was experiencing a algae crisis. The plants were dying because brown algae grow on top of their stems and leaves. I tried this product for several weeks, I cannot say it didn't work at all: it seems it worked a little, for example, the green algae seems to be controlled. But the most dangerous brown algae seems was not affected at all, and the plants are even worse than before.I should point out that it is safe to the fish, at least based on my experience. In fact I almost doubled the dose, but the fish are still OK."
4,Algae serial killer,What can I say except that this stuff works. Economically priced and way less work than scraping the aquarium glass weekly. The one problem that I have noticed that the few living plants I have in the aquarium don't seem to be thriving like they used to. Be forewarned if you have real plants. I like my plastic plants better anyway.
2,Steer clear,This product simply does not work. I used it for three weeks following the instructions and everything remained the same. I have a 20 gallon tropical aquarium and I instead replaced the substrate after giving up with multiple products. I'm not sure if this works with other forms of algae (mine was green)but i'd be hesitant.
5,Well made plush.,"This plush is durable and very well made. The picture is a very good representation of the item. The ""Fullmetal Alchemist Edward Sitting Pose Plush"" Looks great on my shelf. Your life will not be complete without the ""Fullmetal Alchemist Edward Sitting Pose Plush""."
2,Book review,"Might be interesting to an academic....but the majority of the book is the introduction, and I didn't enjoy this book at all. I expected more of Evita's words than the editor's."
4,Very insightful,"Good short history in introduction. Although some doubt cast about the authenticity, it is still very insightful of Evita's last and final thoughts and feelings and enlightening about her character and personality added to her previous work My Message aka Evita by Evita."
3,Evita Peron: who was she?,"I have read much about Evita and also visited Argentina in search of the real person. She still is an enigma to me, part Mother Teresa,selfisness, part not with the program. She had an somewhat misguided attachment to Juan Peron that could have been honest admiration or self serving mechanism for her desire for immortality and rising above her humble beginnings. The writings in this book do not sound like they are from a completely mentally healthy iondividual and ramble to the point of distraction. I have no concrete idea of what she was trying to say and I think her lack of education had much to do with her not being able to articulate her thoughts into cohesive prose. When I read of all she did for the poor people, it is hard to really find where all the money came from. How much coercion was needed to fund all of her projects? I guess I will continue to wonder and read about her, especially material written by those really close to her."
1,"Dull, Tedious, and Repetitious!","This may be the worse book I've ever ""read."" It contains 46 pages of tedious arguments regarding the validity of ""My Message"" (which Evita may or may not have written), followed by 46 pages of the actual message in English, 5 message pages in Spanish, 13 pages of (good) B&W photos, and a 5 page ""chronology"" (bare ""facts"") of her life. I hoped to gain insight into Evita herself by reading her ""message"" and maybe I did. It is this: she's the most boring person I've ever read! Her ""message"" consists entirely of ranting and raving about how wonderful and downtrodden ""the people"" are and how drippingly adoring she feels about Peron and ""the people."" Awful, awful, awful! Much more interesting is ""Santa Evita"" (by Martinez) which is a novel but a fascinating one with a lot of interesting historical surmises. I'm still looking for a good biography, unfortunately!"
4,Overview Compilation,"A compilation of contemporaneous stories about pirates, which was compiled in the early 1800s. It is a very, and I want to stress very, general overview on pirate lives. It sounded to me like a good compilation of stories when I received the book however; it seemed to be information obtained for a child's use. This is not a scholarly type of source in the least and should not be read as such. It is however, a good general overview of the basic biography of major/famous pirates."
1,Not for everyone,"Kiyosaki warns you stright away that this book will not suit 9/10 people. Still I proceeded to read the book and found the information presented to lack substance and detail.Some of the infromation contained in this book is indeed useful but it is very hard to asborb what is useful when the book has been written in a non consise and repetitive manner. Kiyosaki mentions the stock market bear run of 00-03 and investors losing 7-9 trillion dollars in detail so many times that you begin to look for any other information this book has to offer. No mention is given to the stock market rally after this time and the gains that followed.For someone that does not seem to like the idea of mutual funds and the stock market in general, Kiyosaki loves to quote Buffet. He seems to understand the market better then people such as Graham and Buffet in the way he can predict market cycles and is able to time his investments.Based on Kioysaki's own statement, this book will not suit 9/10 investors."
1,Not useful at all,Same thing gets repeated over and over without a real insight of any thing. Waste of time.
3,This book is not about how to make money,"If you are getting this book to make money quickly, this is not the book for you. Actually the whole purpose of ths book is to inform you that you have to make money step by step in a continuous way but the proccess takes a long time."
1,Worst Book Ever,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! OR ANY OTHER BOOK WRITTEN BY THIS AUTHOR. HE IS A CHARLATAN, A CHEAT, A CROOK. THE ONLY PERSON THAT MAKES MONEY FROM THIS BOOK IS THE AUTHOR. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PERSONAL FINANCE LOOK UP JOHN BOGLE OR WILLIAM BERNSTEIN. THERE IS NO WAY FOR YOU (THE READER) TO GET RICH QUICK BY READING THIS WORTHLESS BOOK."
1,Who Took My Money - Robert Kiyosaki took my money that's who,"At this point, I feel that the Rich Dad series is nothing more that the same philosophy repeated over and over again. Invest for cash flow, act like a business owner rather than an employee, and play the game to win. Its all very philosophical, but provides very little actual advice. Its pretty clear that Robert Kiyosaki and his staff are just milking the popularity of their concept and success of the first book (which probably bankrupted thousands of people once the real estate bubble popped. (9-1 leverage yikes, collapsing real estate prices, tight credit, there is so much that just isn't possible without loose money and hot a real estate). They are printing money for themselves yet provide almost zero actual useful advice.So to answer the question, Who Took My Money? Robert Kiyosaki took my money, that's who."
4,skip a few,"""Movin' Along"" is a mixed bag. I have no problem with the miking of James Clay's flute, and he's good. His sax is a little low in the mix when he's riffing with Wes, but otherwise it's fine. He's not a smokin' tenor and should have stayed with the flute on this date. Victor Feldman (piano), Sam Jones (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums) are a great support group. Feldman is a standout.The real problem is the song selection. Some of these tunes weren't good vehicles for Wes. The up tempo stuff works better. And I prefer that alternate takes are lumped at the end of the disc, rather than paired with the master takes.But it's Riverside Wes Montgomery, and his fans will want it. Enjoy it for the numbers that do work, and hit Skip on the remote for the ones that don't."
4,Great Traditional Bluegrass Sound,"A friend lent me this CD and it took me over two months to give it back. There is some great powerful singing here - the album really delivers that driving traditional bluegrass sound. Nice full harmonies coupled with some great instrumentals. Loved ""Leavin"" - sing it at your next jam. The song ""These Old Pictures"" really moved me - a tear-jerker. I recommend this CD to those who like powerful singing in a traditional package."
2,POOR RECOMMENDATION,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR A FRIEND BUT DECIDED TO GIVE IT A QUICK READ BEFORE GIFTING. LET ME SAY FIRST.. I AM NOT A READER... BUT WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE BOOK FROM OTHERS HAD ME WANTING TO TRY. THIS BOOK DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST PAST 13 PAGES. I GAVE IT A GOOD EFFORT BUT COULDN'T SUFFER ANYMORE. MY FRIEND ENJOYED THE BOOK THOUGH.
5,City & Errand,"""City on the Edge of Forever"" is the best of the 1st season. The ending is a real tear-jerker.""Errand of Mercy"" gives us a ""first look"" at the notorious Klingons featuring the late John Colicos in his unforgetable role as Kor. He really steals the show with his snarling,his laugh & his acting."
4,Just Curious....,"Has anyone noticed that the overlay picture on the back, for ""City..."", shows McCoy in his distressed state, however the inset shows a totally diffrent episode? Anyone?"
1,way too overrated,"it's a rotten script written by a manipulative novelist.There are several flaws in the episode. For example, why didn't Kirk try to take Edith Keeler to the 23rd century like he took Gillian (Star Trek IV)not to mention he almost brought the pilot John Christopher until he learned his offspring is important to the future?"
3,Why only two episodes on each DVD?,"In Australia,where I live,I can go into a store and buy a Star Trek video with these episodes on and it has a third episode on it as well.The 3 episode videos of the series also have new filmed introductions by Star Trek actors such as James Doohan and George Takei.So why is it that the DVD versions have only two episodes and little else? Not good enough Paramount."
3,Classic Treks Involving Time-Travel and Klingons,"Star Trek presents two of it's early landmark episodes that introduced the world to the Guardian of Forever and the Klingon Empire!""The City on the Edge of Forever"": Captain Kirk and Mister Spock must travel back to the 1930s in an attempt to prevent Dr McCoy from changing history. Will Kirk have to sacrifice Edith Keeler to put things right?Then in ""Errand of Mercy"", the Enterprise crew are tasked to their limits when faced with impending war with intergalactic opponents the Klingons! How can Kirk stop what seems inevitable, and can the Organians help?Order this exciting release at once and may the wind be at your backs!"
4,Older mounting for car docking unit,This is for the older model Sirius radio for your car. This won't work for the current model that is out now. Works great for the correct model!
5,alison krauss and the cox family,grrrrrrrrrreat grassy cd. i've always loved this group. this was the beginning of alison's bright bluegrass future :) the voices of angels... i promise :)
2,"great voices, shallow arrangements","Well, I love Alison Kraus, and the Cox Family, but I'm very dissappointed in this CD. In my opinion the arrangements (sorry Alison) are vapid, and keep the great vocals from ever reaching beyond light entertainment. Basically, even on the ballads, the parameters are set to ""light"" rather than ""deep and soulful."" Perhaps I just go in for a more pure and traditional sound. The title track is lovely, and Suzanne Cox is a fabulous singer, but even here the arrangement holds back on power and depth. The cut ""In the Palm of Your Hand"" is beautiful, but it sounds like something off an Alision Kraus album -- no problem with that, but I sure would like to hear the Cox Family in a less controlled setting."
2,Not So Good,I had high hopes when I purchased this cd. It is by far the weakest collection that Allison has put together.
3,music,"Of all the Allison Krauss discs, this is my least favorite. Who ever sings with her is too much nasal."
4,Great Noir Vibe,"I found this through daily deals! I loved the book, but when I went to purchase the next in the series-the prices were out of hand! $12.99 ? For paperless? Granted, I would pay half that but nooooooooo way $12.99. Sorry Penguin Publishing, but dream on. The author is very talented, and the writing style harks back to classic, gritty hard-boiled detective novels where the good guy learns you can't trust anyone- especially dames ;-). Bring the price down for e-readers and I'll buy them all!"
3,March Violets,"It could have been the same story anywhere---Chicago, New York---just the place names and time period changed. Lots of slang words that sounded like low life in Berlin"
4,Good detective story in pre-war Nazi Germany,"My first Philip Kerr book was Field Gray, an excellent spy-police thriller. I decided to start the Bernie Gunther series from the beginning with March Violets which is a very good book even though I enjoyed Field Gray more.If you plan on reading the full Berlin Noir trilogy by Philip Kerr I recommend buying ""Berlin Noir"" straight awaty. One gets three books for just over the price of one single volume.I enjoyed the March Violets so much that I bought the trilogy too."
3,The Beginner,"Now I have read all of the Philip Kerr Bernie Gunther novels. March Violets proves to be the weak one in the pile, as I guess that Kerr was just trying to thresh out the character that he later made into such an intriguing and fascinating detective. The time frame for the novels, usually in the Hitler days or shortly thereafter is informative and seemingly historically accurate. In March Violets I felt that the story and character of Bernie Gunther had not been as well fleshed out as it later is. It was also disappointing that Gunther used, as an interrogation tactic, the threat to turn a person over to the ""queer squad,"" knowing full well that the interrogee was not gay, and that the sick squad would make short order of him anyway. Gunther is later presented as a man with more integrity, and this episode is a stain on his record."
4,Sam Spade in Berlin,"I read the three Bernie Gunther books after reading Kerr's current ""If the Dead Not Rise."" They fill in the gap between the two sections of that book, detailing what occurred between 1935 and 1954. They are very enjoyable, especially as a window on pre-WWII Germany, and are quite ""film noir"" in style. Not quite as dark as Alan Furst, but in the same mood. Gunther is a former German policeman turned private detective when all non-Nazis were purged from the force. He is very much Sam Spade in Berlin, the cynical, wiseguy PI in the style of Bogart's Rick. If you like the era, you will really enjoy the Gunther series."
2,Wilted violets,"This book contains a lot of interesting details about Germany right before World War 2. The author has certainly done some serious research. I just couldn't get past his style, however. He seems to be trying to channel Raymond Chandler or Ross McDonald, but his writing is clunky. Every other sentence includes an overworked and unnecessary simile, and he winds up just sounding lame and boring *like a drunk sitting next to you at dinner and holding forth on some uninteresting topic* (see what I just did there?--that's the whole book). Also, his treatment of the female characters is troubling and a little overheated. But then, at the end, the main character gets sent to a concentration camp, and the book becomes much more serious and much better. It was a weird reading experience. Afterwards, I ended up reading ""In the Garden of Beasts"" by Erik Larson, a factual book about the same period in Germany. Much better and much more interesting!"
2,Read Robert Harris instead!,"Do yourself a favor... read FATHERLAND by Robert Harris instead if you like this sort of thing. I was very, very disappointed with how predictable this book was. It was written with the knowledge of what happened, but not written as if the characters didn't know what happened.I give it a 2 stars instead of a 1 because I liked how Kerr handled some of his descriptions of Berlin, but I would not recommend Kerr, and this series, to anyone."
3,More of a Survey,"A nice collection or survey of textiles, but not very good for more detailed research.Because the price is right, this is a worthy book to add to your library.Not for the advanced collector."
5,Katherine Pierce,"When Jessica and Rachel are watching tv,well rewinding a Katherine Pierce movie,Katherine is on tv,and it says that she is the spokesmodel for Slenderella Spa Chain. Rachel calls Slenderella and gets her friends in the Unicorn Club,Ellen-The President,Jessica,Lila,Kimberly,and Mandy. Rachel is rich,so Lila and Rachel outdo each other by buying 6 Purple Unicorn Workout suits,and Diet Supplements.Lila and Rachel try to have tea with Katherine as much as possible,to make each other jealous.The Unicorns notice something isn't right about Katherine,like she isn't healthy,She hasn't eaten much."
2,"Did I hear her say she's a ""professional belly dancer"" ??","I really wanted to like this, but there's an elephant in the room and I just can't be silent any longer...professional belly dancer? The instructor may understand the mechanics of basic belly dance moves, and may be able to execute them technically, (and maybe even kind of explain them), but devoid of the spirit of belly dance: she is the most ungraceful belly dancer I have EVER seen. And Belly dance *is* grace. I nearly ejected it from the player when she was demonstrating a step with arm movement and her arms were just FLAPPING like a CHICKEN, literally. It was painful for me to watch. I gave it a chance, though. She seems friendly, sweet, and her heart is in the right place? But it didn't get better for me. In the end I just don't want to learn anything from an instructor I'd be embarrassed to dance like."
2,"It is OK, but not for the lng term","I bought this because it was recommended to me by someone in my beginning bellydance class. I went through it a few times and found it helpful, but I prefer other practice DVDs a lot more. I have loaned my copy to other beginners, who have liked it for a while, same as me, then were ready to move on to something else."
1,Poor dancing,The dancing in this video is terrible. Please do not spend any money learning bad habits that will be hard to correct later. I spend more time watching bellydancing than doing it and this was painful to watch. Please save your money.
1,Skip this one,"I just finished this DVD and had to immediately come to the computer and post. The instruction and pacing is terrible. It teaches at a snail's pace, which isn't bad in and of itself, except that the instructor also talks so much between every single fraction of a movement that you never catch the flow--and her personality and speaking style is grating and self-conscious. Definitely skip this one..."
1,Beginners Owe it to themselves to buy something else,"This is the Worst Bellydance Video I have ever seen. Natasha's posture is terrible. She can't isolate. Any dancer worth her salt on that slice of pizza on the cover would never do a choreo, even a beginner one, standing in one place the entire time! She has a beautiful space to dance in but even in her bonus dance, she makes no attempt to fill that space. Maybe that is a blessing considering that weird arm thing that happens when she body rolls in a circle. She may talk about posture but doesn't actually model good dance posture. She communicates none of the information on stetching, warm up, or cool down that is necessary for a movement teacher of any kind, much less dance movement. Students model what they see and if you follow this DVD you risk injury at worst and learning terrible bellydance and something that is not bellydance at best. Natural Journeys should be ashamed for irresposibly publishing something this bad."
3,Belly Dance for Wimps-Not Serious Dancers,"Belly Dance for Wimps is perfect if you want to add a fun little dance routine to your usual belly dance workout, especially if you use any of the DVD/VHS belly dance exercise routines. I received this DVD for Christmas and found I was too advanced for it. Surprisingly there was no warm-up before the belly dance lesson section. I highly recommend you do some stretching before performing any of the lessons.Natasha Senkovich is spicy and sassy as an instructor. She gives very detailed explanations of belly dance moves. And in the end she puts them together in a great little spicy dance perfect for someone who has never danced before.If you are curious about belly dancing and want to explore the sensual side of being a Goddess, I recommend this for you. It's a good beginners DVD and easy to follow. But if you've been dancing a while and know all the basic belly dance moves, then I suggest you skip this one. It's for ""wimps"" but not serious dancers."
4,i was wrong!!!,"yesterday i left bad feedback about my new hx-d77. a wire had shorted and the subwoofers were not functioning. after finding and fixing the problem,i'm happy to say it sounds just great!!!"
2,Look elsewhere,The JVC HX-D77 is a great sounding unit. But it is hard to pull in local FM stations. Very old fashion inputs in the back of unit. Needed to buy another radio.
3,Why can't JV CCCCCC,okay im going to start out by saying i am a 19 year old kid so you can stop reading if your bias right now. But i like to listen to songs with bass on a unit and i used to have the old jvc system with the giga tubes when the were new and it had very deep bass. but this system really dosnt seem to cut it its decent but not worth the month i dont think. I was pretty disapointed but i will give it this...its a monster with sound. I also am experiencing problems with the volume control now so im about to send it in for repairs. other than that it is a pretty decent system if you can get passed the little bass issue.-JaY
5,jvc hx-D77 540- WATT DVD MINI SYSTEM,"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD PURCHASE FOR ME,AND IT ARRIVED AT A TIMELY FASHION THANK YOU VERY MUCH"
2,Very disapointed,Im very picky about sound. To me this stereo has very little bass I hate ports and the speakers are very light and start clipping at 10 on the volume knob. I have some old aiwa speakers that dont look as fancy and output more bass.
5,Lest we forget,"The night (Australian time) that America shook, had such a deep impact on me that I'm determined I'll never forget.They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and that is especially true of the excellent images contained within the covers of this book.Although there are many images of the horrific moments of that morning in New York, the most significant aspect of the book - in my opinion - is the way that it covers how the people reacted and recovered from the event in the days and weeks following Sept. 11. These moments are significant to me because I'm sure that, while I'll never forget the indellible image of seeing planes hitting buildings, it's the human side of the story that must not be forgotten."
3,great shoe - runs VERY small,"if you love platform wedges, this killer shoe is for you! unfortunately, it runs VERY small, so order up a whole size. i've ordered this shoe three times now - hoping to find a pair that fits. i wear a 9.5, and even the 10 didn't work - it fit my size 9 mom perfectly. i've searched the web, and jessica bennet doesn't make larger than a 10 (really a 9). what's the deal?????"
5,Simply divine,"Great book! A gripping start, a large and complex cast of characters, and a strong moral all combine to make this book compelling reading."
1,"Danger, Will Robinson",This book glorifies violence and Christianity. It should be kept out of the hands of vulnerable children and banned from all schools!
1,missing bible,ordered at the beginning of august 2010. est delivery was SEPT 14th. as of Sept 17th have still not received order
1,unbelievable nonsense,"The bible is a long, boring book about a cruel god who requires the killing and torture of his own son. God is constantly ordering or sanctioning the killing of millions of people - specifically telling his followers not to spare women, children, or animals. It contains teachings that are inconsistent with the laws of nature and with the structure of the physical world. It asserts that the world is flat and sits on pillars and that the sky is a solid vault. It contains talking snakes and donkeys, as well as dragons, unicorns, and cockatrices. It is historically inaccurate. It contains numerous unfulfilled prophecies. Not for the shoddy intellect? This book was written by the shoddy intellect, about the shoddy intellect, and for the shoddy intellect."
4,Pretty and Functional,"Considering that they're metal, the bowls are pretty and coordinate beautifully with the Pink Trio dinnerware. The lids fit well, and the bowls stack nicely in the refrigerator. Foods in them maintain their temperature nicely.The bowls are not microwave safe and the instructions state that they should be hand washed. No mention was made of the oven, but I assume they're not meant to go in the oven & that they're for serving and storage only."
1,Don't Be Fooled By The Image,"Maybe I'm slow on the 'take-up', but this is NOT a standard tool bag. IT HAS NO BOTTOM!!! One of the images on the screen does show it 'open', but I assumed it was showing the large TOP opening. WRONG!!! It's completely open on the BOTTOM. It's made to fit over (and down-around) the top 'seat' of a ladder. You cannot use it as a standard tool bag to carry around tools. (Live an learn!)"
2,Feels like a hack,"I bought this kit because the regular lumbar support kept splitting (since it's basically made of foam). While this looks like it will be more durable than the lumbar support, and does provide some support - I found the design of the kit and the installation wanting. Despite Herman Miller's reputation for elegant design, this kit feel like a hack, requiring you to stretch (and potentially tear) into the pellicle backing of the chair in order to run a control cable thru. I guess I expected better from HM."
5,TESTED SET,I have a set listed for sale.I tested the set by running this under water for 5 minutes.IT DOES NOT BLEED. Perhaps the customer who left a review received a defective piece.Hopefully they returned their defective piece.
2,watch out for water,These good looking salad servers have one fatal flaw--if the handles get wet the colored pieces in the handles 'bleed' and can stain your countertop and linen napkins and towels.
3,Hot & cold!,"One huge problem I have always had with the DC Universe is that their heroes are created too powerful. The likes of Superman, Flash, Martian Manhunter, etc. are shown here to do some unbelievably feats yet they are also succumb to things that wouldn't seem to make sense given their power displays earlier. It's the unevenness that bothers me and its quite evident here. This story, focusing on Martina Manhunter isn't bad but at times it was hazy as what exactly was going on. That could be Joe Kelly's fault or the artist, Doug Mahnke, might not have been clear enough. Mahnke does provide some spectacular visuals. There are certain scenes here that I will always remember. They are that good. However, there is are a lot of pages that seem to lack that same effort. Overall, this is a an interesting book that is a little convoluted but worth your time."
4,Thyroid cancer book review,"This is a great book for someone recently diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. It covers just about everything and answers many questions you may have and doctors don't have time or the inclination to answer. I think it's valuable in providing you with basic knowledge of this disease, so you can talk to your endocrinologist and become an active participant in your treatment."
5,Louisiana Dawn (The Louisiana History Collection),Love Jennifer Blake ~ Great Author ~ It keeps your interests from start to finish. Really hard to put down.
4,Louisiana Dawn (The Louisiana History Collection),I liked the book. Even tho it was the second time I have read it. I like all of Jennifer Blake books.
4,Louisiana Dawn,"I've only read the first book but will now definately order the rest. Extremely interesting, you cannot put the book down."
3,Chimes,"These are nice windchimes but the price is a little high, i would recommend them if youve got the money."
4,Even More True Now Than it Was a Decade Ago!,"Ralph Schoenstein wrote ""Toilet Trained for Yale"" a decade ago, long before ""Tiger parenting"" came into the spotlight. Sadly, the insane competition to try to create ""trophy children"" has only intensified since then. What Schoenstein wrote as satire and hyperbole now looks like prescience. ""Toilet Trained for Yale"" is both hilarious and sad. Hilarious because Schoenstein uses razor-sharp wit to lampoon the absurd lengths that ""Tiger Moms"" (and dads) will go to in order to get a leg up on the competition. Sad because so many kids today have been reduced to mere status symbols akin to a Birkin handbag or Mercedes SUV plastered with OBX, 26.2, and other assorted ""look at me, aren't I amazing?"" bumper stickers. Recommended."
3,Toilet Trained Tots - How True!,"I don't have any children of my own but was drawn to this book based upon my own encounters with the increasing number of ""Toilet Trained for Yale"" tots and their stop-at-nothing push-parents.The author delivers an insightful, biting commentary on this parenting trend, that in the effort to produce the brightest and best baby, these parents will do and try almost anything!""Parents are not raising a child. They are raising a living resume.""Through laugh out loud passages, the author takes us a step back to look at the hilarity and obsurdity of the ever prominent baby and me classes, music for the womb cd's, and all other gimicks that are touted to insecure, compensating, over-achieving parents.A funny, quick read. However, based on the content and length, I would reccommend waiting for the paperback!"
5,Grounded again,"I was given this book as a gift from my in-laws. I can't thank them enough. It's very hard to look around at other kids whose parents are taking them to gymnastics class, 2nd language class, music class, scheduled play class, etc. and not feel like you are deficient as a parent if you're not doing the same. I easily fall into the trap of panicking that my daughter, who is 18 months old, isn't being exposed to enough, or talking enough, or climbing well enough. This book really helps me keep my feet on the ground and remember that Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't have the benefit of ""language flashcards"" at 12 months and she turned out just fine. Oh, and the ""reading"" 6 month olds...give me a break!"
3,The Best of Mediocre Poetry,"I bought this one for a buck at a library sale, and I think I just about got my money's worth. The introduction by A.R. Ammons wasn't all I'd hoped for from a poet I admire so much, but included in the collection are poems by the likes of John Ashbery, Charles Bukowski, Amy Clampitt, James Merrill and Charles Simic. (Yeah, they're in alphabetical order. Weird, huh?) All things considered, The Best American Poetry 1994 seems to confirm that 1994 wasn't exactly a banner year for American poets."
4,Wonderful book for the preteen horse lover.....,"The book I have is from Scholastic Book Services, copyright 1963 with 1st printing April 1971. The book is illustrated by Sam Savitt.My 7 year old daughter enjoyed this book because it had many different stories about young girls and horses. We would read one story each night before bed.When she is older and able to read this for herself she will enjoy it even more.Many of the stories have underlying issues about interests in boys as well as horses. Several of the stories are about self sacrifice in the interest of family.If you can find this book your preteen horse lover will enjoy it very much."
4,Its a great movie,If you've ever seen Menudo when you grew up this is a movie for you. It will bring back chilhood memories from Puerto Rico and how much fun it was to see Menudo back when you where a kid. Buy it and you will see that is was worth it. Plus this is a grat way to show your kids what YOU used to like when you wher a kid. Enjoy with the entire family.
2,Cheap Plastic!!!,"Looks nice. This is plastic. Did not last even for 2 months. We use very light items like cookies, etc to move around ."
3,NOT a coordinating Shadow Iris item...,"This is a nice tray, and seems sturdy enough; however, I was expecting the usual purple Shadow Iris pattern. That is not what it is, however...the irises are PINK, and the design is done in all pastel colors which totally clash with my kitchen. I'm very disappointed, and never would have bought this tray if the listing photo had been clearer."
5,It's AWESOME!!!,"Love this movie... The guy here who posted whatever he posted doesn't know what he is talking about. He never even watched the movie because he says it is 2.5 hours long and it is actually 97 minutes... This film show what one can do with a limited budget and a lot of ability... If you are a filmmaker or want to be buy this movie! If you are a ""critic"" say what you want...................."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this in hopes of losing weight and lost nothing. It didn't seem to do much of anything for me, except have me go to the bathroom."
3,Do not buy this product!,"I am sorry to say, that you will never be able to play this MMO: on August 31 of 2007, PlayNC had to shut down the last server. There were just never enough paying subscribers to make the game financially viable.R.I.P., Auto Assault ... your potential greatness never had a chance to bloom. 8("
1,way to soft.,it hurts my back. its not a good quality chair at all that pushes down and is not hard enough. no wood under the seat but you cant tell from the picture. not worth anywhere near $100.
1,Total nonsense,"Pleeaase! This is not the dark forbidden, but a real nonsense starting with SP - almost nun deflowered ritually with drugged dagger by a spy/sexually abused/sex maniac hero..."
2,Adventures with catholic school girls.,"This is confused, muddle-headed romantic suspense.The Author starts with a simple love and redemption plot.Then adds four potential lovers, two catholic vocations, one unsolved prostitute murder, a little international intrigue and finally some bondage and drugs. Then these items are shaken and stirred until you have a confused blend of The Flying Nun meets the Marquis de Sade.Too many story lines. Unbelievable lead characters and situations. A cartoonish evil villian who is too inept to represent a threat to the hero and heroine. Uninteresting, unconvincing foreplay with knives.Offensive Catholic stereotypes. Skip this one."
2,full of contradictions and it wanders,"There is supposedly some big conspiracy in the background of this story, but the details are never clear. The inconsistencies drove me crazy. For instance, in one place, a character's throat is cut with a machete but it takes her hours to bleed to death. Later, a character is poked in the wrist with an embroidery needle and is unconscious and near death from blood loss within moments. A thousand more instances like this. Also, lots of hinting and promising of hot kinky sex, but very little delivered. A big yawn."
5,Sizzler from the first page until the last.,I haven't read a book this exciting in years. My first for Suzanne Forster. Cannot wait to find her other books. The exotic sexual content was captivating and the storyline was just as great. I just could not stop reading this book
1,This Book's Plot is as Thin as the Paper it's Printed On,"This was my first Suzanne Forster book, and I won't be reading another one. The plot is impossible to believe, the ""hero"" of the book is a sadist who constantly puts the woman he ""loves"" in jeopardy by handing her over to his enemies and giving her mind-altering drugs. And, the outdated representation of Catholicism is borderline offensive. There were some stabs at character development but they were lost amongst the befuddled ""mystery"" plot."
1,ROUND FILE MATERIAL!!!!!!,"READING THIS BOOK WAS LIKE PLAYING WITH A POISONOUS SPIDER. I TREATED AS SUCH, KILLED IT AND ROUND FILED IT. I THEN TOOK A HOT SOAPY SHOWER."
2,too difficult a stretch of credibility,"Great sex but even that stretches my ""willing suspension of disbelief."" Impossible situations and characters, but - interesting sex."
1,Sick,"I agree with the reviewers who labeled this book sick and offensive. The ""hero"" abuses the heroine. Also she acts so stupidly, you don't really care what happens to her. Save your money and your time."
4,A wonderful page-turner,"I have read most of Ms Forester's novels and while this on does not rate as the highest, it is still a page-turner. The transformation, or rather the manifestation of the inner being, the true being, of the female protagonist from would-be nun to the companion and lover of one of the most passionate men I have had the privilage to meet between the pages of a book, is indeed something to behold. The action in the book is racy and keeps a reader on his toes throughtout the novel. The addition of the secondary character Blue, and her unattainable love for the ""good"" revrend is a receipe for a sequel. I hope to read more about this character in a subsequent publication. I was loath for it to end, but end it did. I would suggest reading this novel slowly, if that is at all possible, to savour the book, because its difficult to find a replacement once one has finished it. Definately a keeper"
1,Horrible..,"This is my first book by Suzanne Forster and was excited to read it but I didn't enjoy the book at all. Firstly I loved the concept and the darkness of it but my main problems were: 1.) Very little ""page time"" with the main characters. 2.) The secondary love story took up half the book. I wanted to read more about the main characters, not them. 3.) Too wordy and introspective...there was very little dialogue in the book. Too much description. If a character asked a question, the other character answered it --one and half pages later! 4.)Webb was not developed enough! I couldn't get a sense of WHY he loved this woman...I couldn't understand why Mary Frances loved him???5.) The priest and the hooker plot bored me to tears, not enough sizzle between them.Basically I was lost in the book (and not in a good way). Confused was more like it. The Golden Needle thing was not believable."
3,If you like your heroes to be controlling . . .,"Innocence - Mary Frances Murphy, poster girl for young novices everywhere, is expelled from the convent when she is found praying that she should not die without knowing the pleasures of the flesh. Now, why couldn't she have been praying silently, I do not know, but then we wouldn't have this story, now would we? Ask and you shall receive, said the Lord in his infinite wisdom, Hallelujah! and Mary Frances meets Webb Calderon, a manly muscled millionaire who more than makes her wishes come true. He could also be the man responsible for her sister's death, but you can't be picky about everything, now can you?"
3,"listing may be misleading, may not be 1900mah",(Preface: I ordered a 1500mah version.) Interstate Batteries said Amazon has the listing wrong for the 1500mah and 1900mah. IB said they don't offer a 1500mah or 1900mah version. I found that out when I was sent a 2000mah version that is 1-2mm taller than my oem 1500mah. 2000mah barely fits in my Wahl beard trimmer. If you order the 1500mah or this 1900mah from Interstate you'll most likely receive a 2000mah that may or may not physically fit your device. Order with caution.
4,"A very readable, intelligent thriller","This book was listed a few years ago on a respected reviewers ""best bets"" and although I recorded the title for reading at some future time it was only recently that I remembered the title again while browsing and decided to give it a try. In the book, Ignatius has captured the essence of a young reporter's conflict between writing a good and important story and compromising his beliefs. The development of the central character, Eric Truell, is masterful and the inside look at the workings of the intelligence community is fascinating. The plot moves quickly and keeps you interested. I particularly like the way in which the chapters and the scenes flow which makes the reader want to continue reading even beyond bedtime! I recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers and adventure but is looking for something a little bit different than your typical international espionage fiction. It's very readable and worth a try!"
4,A journalist's novel of high-wire journalism and espionage,"I am an admirer of David Ignatius's journalistic work, so when I saw a favorable review of his then-new book, I rushed to buy it. Then, I put it on a shelf, where it languished until I rediscovered it a few weeks ago. A story by a journalist about a journalist cum CIA operative, it's a great read. I am not a fan of most thrillers, but Ignatius manages to keep tightening the screw without splattering blood all over the page. The ""novelistic"" aspects of the book were of a little lower level of craft than the descriptions of high-wire espionage and journalism. The ex-girlfriend and his almost unrequited relationship with her were a little too perfect, his career was a little too successful, and at the end of the book, he wrapped up the loose ends a little too neatly. So he's not John Updike yet, I still give this book high marks and a strong recommendation and I am looking forward to his newest book."
3,"This ""Tender Escape"" did not move me!!","Ok, if this book seems that this book as not too hot, it wasn't! But it did have great characteristics of a mystery/suspense novel. Hello, where was the romance? A fellow reviewer said something about not to expect good things from Poarch, but her pervious works are the bomb, it was just this book. Poarch is my girl, but I felt this book could have been more romantic than it was. Olivia and Clifton seemed to fall into the some type of partnership, before I know it they were in love and in a personal relationship, what's up with that! One minute their on a steakout, then all of a sudden in each others arms. I just felt there should have been more romance, since it is being called a romance novel!! I loved the way Poarch brought to light the delicate issue of loving someone for who they are on the inside, instead of just the outside! It was a very easy read, but not at all what I am used to from Poarch to produce! But I'm still a big fan!"
2,"Alright, but definitely not the best","that I've seen. If this is any indication for Ms. Poarch, then I say not to expect great things from her. I mean, the plot seemed like it could've gone further if only she didn't make it seem so dull. It's almost as if they (the characters) fell for each other too soon and she felt like she had to drag it out to meet a page quota or something. I dunno, maybe somebody else will like this book better, but for me it seemed more like a stretched out mystery, with a drawn out love story attached."
3,For the completist only.,"Maybe, I'm just spoiled by all of the new Slayers movies, but this latest one seems significantly more derivitive and less funny than the rest. Not that it's bad, far from it; it just seems like this movie has less original material to offer. We've got another royal family feud, Lina and Naga choose opposite sides again and have another duel (though this one has a definitive winner), and so on. The last few releases gave me full on laughs where this one gives me a few chuckles (Lina's slipper slappings are one thing that never get old for me) but I didn't fall out of my chair this time. Still, you've got to love the princess in this one and the conclusion of her battle with Lina is pretty hilarious. Lina's ""dragon-spooker"" reputation also gets a good workout (much to her dismay) on this one as she faces off against a whole army of them. Cool stuff, but kind of a letdown in comparison to ""Slayers Great"". If you haven't seen that one, pick it up instead of this one."
2,I'm Disappointed by another Slayers OVA,"I bought this w/o having seen it first. I made a mistake. I love the Slayers series, but most of the OVA's are not very good. This plot has been done before in the TV series. With Prince Phil in Seiran. Lina and Naga enter a kngidon that has been usurped by the dragon master, Marlene. An ancient beast is unsealed and comes to destroy the kingdom. You know who has to stop it.What a waste of everyone's time. I have all of the Slayers entries and this one is tied for the worst with the awful ""Slayers Great"". Unless you're like me and prefer to own a series in it's entirety then avoid spending money on this OVA. Like the other Slayers OVA's Lisa Ortiz isn't Lina Inverse. The animation is also poorly done. I know animation isn't one of the more impressive parts of the Slayers series, but this OVA is particularly bad. In addition to bad voice acting and animation, the story has been done already and has no interesting new characters. You're not missing anything."
3,Weakest of the 3 Latest Slayers Movies,"I love the Slayers movies and OVAs. I love them because of the interactions between Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent. This movie puts Lina against Naga in a battle between some king and his daughter. The story is very weak, but the strength of the story is never the reason we become fans of Slayers anyway. This movie provides the reason why Lina is a dragon spooker. My main complaint about the movie is the change in character designs making Lina and Naga less cute.I recommend this movie only for die hard fans of Slayers. Others will probably be underwhelmed."
1,Not a good choice for me,"It may be unrelated but I am unable to give this product a second chance. Perhaps it was a coincidence or perhaps the dosage was too high but after1-2 days of trying this product I had extreme intestinal cramps like I never experienced. I had started this product and had also changed to a new probiotic. The Monday after my Saturday/ Sunday cramping I just happened to have my yearly physical exam with a stool sample and it showed blood . I had to have this test repeated in several weeks and all was fine. Our guess was some problem with diverticula....was it coincidence that it occurred when I started two new products.. maybe...but I am unwilling to try it again. I regret saying this in case it was totally unrelated, which is possible."
3,Segements either great or disappointing,"Tanja and Suzanne save this video. Anna is just okay. Rodney, although beautiful to watch, the sound muffled his voice and there is no instruction for the asanas (poses). He offers no cautions or modifications to the viewer and is hardly therapeutic yoga practice. The Rodney segments are more yoga dance with the backup ladies in snyc. I was truly disappointed as I bought this video hoping all the yoga segments would be useful. Unless, you are familiar with Rodney's work his segments/routines. I have both Tanya's and Suzanne's DVD's and practice with them frequently. We all approach exercise, yoga, and fitness from different viewpoints and different levels, as well as, ages."
2,meh,"I know it is not a reflection on the dvd itself but it really annoys me that Gaiam repackages some if their workouts and markets them like they are new. I actually already owned two of the workouts, but the pictures on the box were different than the ones on the dvds that I own. So, clearly I recommended the cardio and one of the yoga sections :o) The other yoga section (not the one with Rodney Yee) is a little too simple for me and I feel like it is more stretching than working out."
2,Annoying Voice - Tanja,I just bought this DVD and feel as if more than 1/2 of it is wasted. More than 1/2 of it is led by Tanja Djelevic who uses countless cliche little workout phrases and a cutsy little voice which is cute once but not all the way through the workouts. Many of the routines seem to have beens stolen from Karen Voight who is a professional trainer.Rodney Yee and Suzanne Deason are professional and are the only thing that saves this DVD.
5,Waiting on Haley's Comet,"What a great selection of inspirational, real-life stories. I have all of John Eades books and recommend them all."
4,Food for thought,"It has been a few years since I have read this novel; however, I remember its message as though I read it today. This novel not only explores how the life of a clone would be like (in this case, the clone is made from tissue from John F. Kennedy), but it also explores the moral issues our society is just now starting to deal with. Is it right to clone; can the clone live up to the success of the origional; can we expect the clone to behave the same as the origional; can our society accept clones into its ranks? I found myself turning page after page to find out of the new JFK would meet the same standards as the origional."
1,Not about JFK,"This is NOT, contrary to what others have said, about a clone of John F Kennedy. The book does not mention John F Kennedy whatsoever."
4,Invisible College Curriculum,"For those who faithfully collected the late great (and sadly missed) esoteric journal ""Gnosis"" over the years, you have all of these articles already. For those that don't or who want a collection of some of the more outstanding articles and essays from Gnosis in one volume- Eureka, this is for you. The standard of writing and scholarship in Gnosis was superlative, as this collection will demonstrate. A study of this work comprises a sound Intro to Western Esotericism 101 for anyone. I am at at loss to single out one article over another however, Gary Lachman's essay on Swedenborg is one of the finest pieces and lingers in the mind long after you have put down the book itself. Highy recommended."
1,Written by a student who hasn't yet gotten over school,"I don't typically not finish a book, but this one holds the top honor for me of unfinished books. Not only did I not finish it, but I remember exactly why. It's incredibly long (longer than War and Peace? I don't know), has no plot that I can notice, no suspense, and builds no sympathy for the main characters. The book sounds like a hot-air balloon written by a graduate student to disprove a theory of one of his professors. If you're 14 years old, then maybe it'll work for you. But if you're over 30, then forget it."
1,Not a good program if you want to add your own recipes,"I was very disappointed when I tried to add my own recipes -- the only reason I bought the software. If you do not add chapters in alphabetical order, you cannot alphabetize later. The ""enter"" key does not advance to the next box when adding ingredients, you must use the arrow keys which is time consuming and annoying. I was unable to abbreviate words like tablespoon, teaspoon or pound. I purchased this software to replace 5 year old software -- think I'll go back to the old stuff, it's much better suited to my needs."
1,Unhappy customer.,"I bought this program to use along with my Palm. Well, it caused a fatal error on my Palm and I haven't been able to use it since. It was still using it on my computer but the grocery list part doesn't work either. I asked the programmer for help but they ""have no fix at this time"". I have since purchased a MAC computer so I don't use this program at all anymore. I consider that it was a waste of money."
5,A blast from the past,"The instructor reminded me of a Home Economics teacher from the '50s. That said,I can finally crochet. Her explainations are clear and it was very helpful to be able to easily re-run them. I have never been able to figure out how to accomplish the stitches from pictures in books, but now that I can render the basic stitches, diagrams for in books for more complex stitches than were taught on the disk make sense as well."
3,Learning to Crochet,I learned something from this DVD but I sort of regret getting it. You can barely see the picture. Its not very clear to me.
2,Low Resolution video,"Just Got the video today. I'm so excited and play it right away. And when it's play, the video is blurry and i use mac to preview it. Maybe you should remake the video and make the slow motion also."
3,VHS outdated,"Info good but VHS is outdated. Item should be DVD. Had I realized this was on VHS, I would not have purchased it. My bad."
4,Good introduction and review,"If books are not enough for you then buy this DVD. I bought books in the past and usually got stuck. After watching her do the granny square, the instructions I read in the book make sense. The best part is that you can replay as often as you need until you get it."
5,Crochet Instruction at it's best,"I have owned this on video for years. I have not found a better instruction DVD on crocheting . The DVD format makes it easier to review the area of interest. I consider this to be a Must Have DVD for crocheters of any level. If you can only own one DVD this is the One. The project book helps you to develop skills as you crochet along with the DVD or learn new techniques like the Lovers Knot stitch. Her demonstration makes it a snap to learn, and then her shawl gives you ideas of how to apply this stitch to different projects."
5,"All You Will Ever Need. Thank you, Bev.","I couldn't learn crochet from books. God knows I tried. I enjoy being with other women in classes, but they take place after work and keeping up when you're tired adds pressure, and when the class is large I feel guilty taking too much of the teacher's time if I just don't get something. I thought Bev's video was pricey, but I considered classes are $25 a pop and at 2-1/2 hrs. this is more like two videos in one. I swear this is all anyone will ever need to learn to crochet. The video is comprehensive, from absolute beginner to more advanced crochet, and Bev is calm and clear. Being able to watch the stitches being made, as often as you need, is far superior to trying to read a diagram or keep up in class. No pressure. I've since ordered Bev's knitting video. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'm really crocheting and LOVING it! For the first time, I can say ""I really CAN do that!"" Thank you, Bev."
4,good for the price,"I like these clips - they keep the quilt tight, and I don't feel like I need to worry about it falling down. They look great once they are on the wall, and are easy to hang. That being said, they are hard to get straight since there is only one keyhole mount in the middle of each clip. I would buy them again - for the price they work well enough."
1,Not like they used to be,"Sadly I ended up discarding the unused tablets. Very weak flavor, I had to use 2 or 3 tablets for a glass of water. Also artificially 'sweetened' so be prepared to add some more sweetener of your choice. Not what they used to be, which is sad and strange considering the original recipe was a winner for decades! But someone had to improve it, and in the process destroyed a classic. Save your money, and treasured memories. Pass this one up."
2,Not the original!,"I loved Fizzies as a kid and my own kids loved them when I could find them 10-15 years ago. When we saw these we looked forward to having the fun drink again, but we are disappointed! These do not have the same full taste as the originals used to have. We have tried to double the amount we put in one glass of water and still the taste is off. These have nothing in them, no calories, no sugar, no caffeine, no (good) taste! If you've never had Fizzies before these might be okay, but they are a washed out version of the original."
1,Fizzies Fizzled,"We were talking about candies that were around when we were children and Fizzies were mentioned. I use to love Rootbeer flavored Fizzies when I was a kid. I couldn't get them out of my mind. I checked on Amazon to see if they were still being made and to my surprise they were available. I bought a 6 pack. When they arrived, I was ready to enjoy my first Fizzie in 40 years, but discovered I hated the taste of them. I remember them being sweet and tasting good without having to add anything. These were not good tasting to me. I gave a pack to a friend and she disliked them too. I threw the rest away. Sorry makers of Fizzies, who ever you are, you should have kept the orginal formula. What a disappointment!"
1,Fizzies flop,"One star is too many for this product. it doesn't deserve any. I couldn't even drink it. When you pop the fizzy in water, it ends up looking like the dirty water in the San Francisco Bay!.. yucky and foamy.... I dumped it out and threw away the whole box... awful! I remember fizzies as a kid when the actually had some flavor....don't waste your time (and money) on this one. If you're felling nostalgic for the 50's, watch Howdy Doody in stead or buy a hula-hoop... just not fizzies!"
1,fizzies,very disappointed with this. Has a lemony flavor and tastes nothing like the fizzies from years ago. There's no rootbeer flavor to it.
4,Garden Art,An unusual addition to the flower garden. Average quality but interesting design. Not just for Flamingo lovers. Good use of discretionairy landscape dollars.
5,Memories,When I was growing up music meant everything to me. This CD has brought back some happy childhood memories. I have recommended it to all my friends and family.
2,Breakeys: By Redapple,"These Breakeys are okay to play with. I bought a starter pack, and it came with a bunch of keys and a cord to put them on. What I didn't realize then was that it was a one-time toy. After you use a key, you can't use it anymore. You also need someone else to play with you. You put two keys together, and snap them. Whoever has the longer key wins. For durability, I gave it 1 star, because you can only use each key once. It got 1 star for education because what does it teach you? Nothing. If you want more keys, you have to either buy another starter deck and hope to get new keys or buy booster packs. I hope this review helped you!"
5,perfect for the upcoming cold-weather months!,"I had eyed this book for quite some time before I purchased it, and I am so glad I did! The pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book! Most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based, so don't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks (though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy, such as a s'mores hot chocolate). The recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes. Order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty, piping hot drinks!"
2,"One I got was perfect, another came apart.","One I bought was perfect, and cute. In a 34g. The other, the strap promptly came apart. I was really upset. So, I guess it all depends on each individual product."
5,Sensuous Sexy and Versatile Bra,"I was a bit skeptically upon ordering the Whimsy, but it looked nice on the model. WOW, fits great, looks great feels even better. It's hard to find a nice sheer bra. This one delivers. May not be an every-day bra. But I'll be working it into my wardrobe as often as possible. Only wish the product line wasn't so thin. Good delivery and packaging too! The hobo-ham sandwich is a great analogy. Pair this with a fitted brown satin or semi sheer blouse and sky rockets delight."
3,Some big laughs sabotaged by too many songs,"This could've and should've been one of A&C's funnier movies but whenever things get moving Dorothy Shay starts singing and the movie grinds to a halt. At least Costello mugs his way through most of the songs. The voodoo doll scene is by far the funniest and the scene where the hillbillies crawl into bed with Lou is a hit. Definitely worth a look for fans, but the songs are hard to endure."
2,Not so good................,"I agree that this film has some fine gags in it, but it moves with the pace of a vaudville show. Bud and Lou will have a scene, then Dorothy Shay will sing a song, the Bud and Lou, the Dorothy........and so on and so on of about 75 minutes. It isn't an awful film, it just doesn't live up to the standards the boys set for themselves. For the most part they had grown out of this sort of pacing by around 1946, and this film seems to set them back quite a few steps. It took a few films before they'd find their stride again."
2,"""Comin' Round the Mountain""","I wish I could have been on the set when Costello and the mountain witch (Margaret Hamilton from The Wizard of Oz) face off and repeatedly jab pins into each other's voodoo doll. This is a rather weak film, but it's livelier than some A & C outings and the ending gag involving gold is a delight. You might say that ""Park Avenue Hillbilly"" Dorothy Shay sings too often, but the songs are amusing, and you will hear Abbott try to convince Costello that he and a 10-year-old girl will eventually be the same age."
3,Meeting Distant Relatives,"The film begins with a comic song for cafe, society. The Great Wilbert pops up on stage. He is a magician who escapes from his chains. Wilbert may be the heir to a buried treasure back in Kentucky. So they return to the land of the Winfields and the McCoys. [Was this the inspiration for 'The Beverly Hillbillies'?] Dorothy sings another comic song. There is a funny skit about target shooting. Conflict over the results restart a feud. [This tells about popular culture of that time.] How many can share one bed? Wilbert learns about their marriage customs. Can love be created by a potion? ""Voodoo."" ""Who do?"" There is a joke about drinking that potion. Can a marriage end a feud between families?The staged conflict goes on and leads to comedy at the old mine shaft. There is a quick and forced end to this drama. Did a need for money force Abbott and Costello into overexposure by too many films? [This is one film that seems less funny than when I first saw it.]"
2,warning,if you read the green beret series book titled z by the same author you will not get much enjoyment of this book as a lot of the story line was lifted from that book i would say half of the book uses the same sub plot word for word so beware
1,Not the best one yet!!!!!,"Having read the 2 prequels and The Rock I was expecting alot more and was sorely disappointed!The plot was just too complicated and I found myself 'lost' more than once.I had difficultly keeping up with who was who,The Watchers,Those that wait,Staar....aaaaahhhhhhh.It took me over a week to finish this book whereas it took me days to finish the other ones.I hope he does better with the next installment and finishes the series soon too!"
4,Low Writting Level,"This book is a very good continuation of the area 51 series, and at times even has you on the edge of your seat unwilling to put it down. This being said, while the book has a good plot and exciting action sequences, it was written on a non-professional level. Doherty ""ghosts"" his characters all over the planet. Some examples would be one of the protagonists is having a dialogue with herself, instead of a dialogue between herself and a scientist. Another protagonist is in another continent and is mysteriously is in another place for just one line... It seems that he couldn't keep his characters strait.This being said, if you read it as you would a high-shcooler's rough draft, it is a very good book."
3,More Great Escapism From Doherty,"This series is always fun to read. And The Mission is probably a little more involved of a story than the previous two. Besides finding out there are groups that are in cahoots with the alien Airlia, there's also a devastating plague spreading throughout South America. I loved all the obstacles Doherty put in the way of Special Forces Captain Mike Turcotte in trying to find out who's responsible for the plague and how to stop it. At times you seriously wonder if he and his buddies are going to get out of this alive. Then there are the always cool re-writes of history that show how much of an influence the Airlia have had on humanity, including starting the Black Death in the Middle Ages and pushing the Inquisition. Some pretty decent action too, especially the assault on Devil's Island. Look forward to continuing on with this series."
4,Very imaginative and a fun read,"I very much enjoyed this and the other books in the Area 51 series. Granted, no book is perfect, and readers will without doubt find their share of weaknesses, but I found the premise of the series to be enhanting and the easy flow of the characters to be refreshing. Were I to log a complaint, it would be for the frequent harsh language used in the first book, and the less frequent harsh language used in the second. Thank goodness by the third RD had figured out that few if any books need gross explitives to make a good story. If you're looking for serious science, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun read, these are great books."
2,Too many people,"The first two books in this series were wonderful but this one misses the mark. There are too many people involved and so much military language and jargon that it's easy to get lost in the language. There is almost as much going on in as many different places as the previous books but the snippets on each location are very short and bounce around like a ""bouncer"". I hope the next two are better than this one."
4,A good read,"This book was another good one from Robert Doherty. Although it starts out slower than the others, it picks up pace before long. The only thing is this; if this is the last book of the Area 51 series, Doherty has done a bad job of concluding the series. Microrobots appear at the Easter Island gaurdian to do an unknown task; the Airlia are still on Mars; Kelly Reynolds is still trapped with the gaurdian; and the foo fighters are back. Hoping for more!"
2,Area 51: The Mission,"I really enjoyed the first two books in the series. I probably would have given them 4 or 5 stars. The third book, however, is not as intriguing as the first two. The story leaves too many questions open ended. There are also several technical errors but I guess one can overlook these. M."
3,I liked it fine.,I usualy only read comic books and stuff like that. This book was real easy to read but it was a long story for me.
5,Very realistically written. Scary. Spellbound.,"I really enjoyed the first 2 books of Doherty. I am looking forward to the next book :""The Mission"". Highly recommended"
2,Not The Best,"Area 51 the Mission that was written by Robert Doherty was not the best. For three differant reasons one, it had tech. terms that nobody would understand; for example DOD, FLTSATCOM. It also had to many characters and you could not keep up with them and forget who everbody was. Finally it was pretty much boring the only action in it was when the man litteraly tore the girl in half with a pistol. When rated it would probably rate a TWO!"
4,Fun Series,"The Area 51 series is good, pulp fiction. A bit over the top, but if you like UFO conspiracies and history, this book is for you."
2,Not another Area 51 book.,"I really enjoyed the first book in the series. I probably would have given it 4 stars. The second book was more of the same and a 3 star at best, but the third book, however, is not as good as the first two. The story just goes on and on and gets sillier and siller. The author is talented, but the real mystery is why he's writing all these Area 51 books? Try Alien Agenda for some facts and exceptional research."
2,slightly interesting,"It's not a solid book or series. The Mission was slow in several places. Like several other reviewers, I have to question where all of these 5 star reviews came from (Many of them sound WAY too similar.) Some of the locations and objects that the author ties together seem a little far fetched, so I read it with a few grains of salt."
1,The Book Lost Me,"I agree with the person from North Platte. The first book was good, but then it just becomes more boring. I DON'T RECOMEND THIS BOOK"
1,Area 51 series started out OK,But fairly slowly descended into tripe. It also could have been condensed into one book. I won' t be buying any more of his books and can' t believe I bought so many. It was like watching a really bad movie and not being able to turn it off because it was so bad.
2,What?????,"I enjoyed the first book. I mostly enjoyed the second by skipping whole paragraphs. I've only partly enjoyed this one by skipping whole pages. Too much plot and counter plot, way too many people and organisations, and all in too many different locations. Maybe it's me, perhaps if I had three brains and four sets of eyes I could take it all in. But I mostly found this plodding and in places incomprehensible. I got the gist of the story, such as it was (although I'm not convinced any advanced alien species would find it worthwhile travelling light years through space just to cause trouble on a developing planet), but boy it was heavy going. That's me finished with this ""series"". In future, if I want a serial I'll read a magazine. I prefer my books to have a beginning, a middle and a decent sort of ending. I now understand some of the other negative reviews. I gave this two stars for the imaginative premise, but am nearly crying with disappointment that it didn't live up to its promise."
1,Repeat,"Mayer should be ashamed of himself. This book is ""Z"" repeated moving ths story from Africa to South America, changing a few names and adding aliens."
3,high anticipation,"I'm ordering this now, all the past ones I've read have been very good, so I hope this lives up to the standard. Always a good selection and stimulating amount of stories. Cheers to them!"
2,Mangled and deformed,"Seriously, this is the worst formatted Kindle book I've ever seen in my life. You could give my cat a scanner and a copy of Stanza and he could do a better job. This is just a quick $9.99 for an existing product for the publisher--and they SHOULD put out all the backlist in ebook, and I'm GLAD they're doing so--but good grief, try a little?How angry and unsupervised are the interns manning the OCR machine?Anyway. I will continue to buy all the books in this very good series, because I appreciate the hard work that goes into the editorial product, but I'm not happy about the fact that the publisher doesn't care about me."
4,Not Boynton's best but still a keeper,"This book is good for little ones learning colors, practicing identifying animals and their sounds, and understanding how not to wear clothing (a coat isn't worn arms first, for example). There really isn't any narrative -- each page contains just four examples of an item of clothing in four different colors, one inevitably worn incorrectly (""Blue hat, green hat, red hat, oops!) -- and I miss the fun of Barnyard Dance, but this is still a fun, educational book."
3,"Cute, but not my favorite Boynton","The pictures were cute and I liked the concept, but this isn't my favorite from Boynton. I don't think there's a problem with the writing or flow of the book though. At the ""oops"" moment you'll want to stop talk about what's wrong about that picture."
5,So good you'll hate it...,"I'm not entirely sure why, but my 18 month old absolutely loves this book. She has a shelf of literally hundreds of books. Blue Hat, Green Hat and But Not the Hippopotamus get read at least 20 times a day... every day.Blue Hat, Green Hat is a book that will grow some. Initially, they will likely enjoy that every set of pages ends with ""Ooops"". From there though, they can learn about colors (the colored articles of clothing really stand out well on the pages), and about where each article of clothing should be worn.It's nice to be able to add to the story with your own details. Trust me, you'll get tired of reading it otherwise."
5,Serious Silliness!,"My four month old LOVES this book. He gets very excited every time I sit down to read it to him. I swear he is mumbling ""oops"" when we get to that on each page. We have several of the Boynton books and he recognizes the characters from one book to the next. This is his favorite however. I love reading it to him too. A definite must read!!"
5,the Washington Color School,"Here in the Washington DC metro area, we parents are always trying to impress other parents with how brilliant our children are. This book is key for that purpose. If your toddler knows colors, he or she can ""read"" this book with an accuracy that will be the envy of all within hearing. The book also, quite practically, teaches the reading eye to start at the top left and move right.It also teaches the little imp to be a comedian, screaming OOPSIE or WHOOPSIE instead of the orthodox ""oops."""
2,Ok but not as good as some others,"I bought this in conjunction with several other books, including Goodnight Moon, Barnyard Dance, Peek-A-Hoo, Silly Sally, Time for Bed and Is your Mama a Lama. Compared to those books, this one is not that good. My daughter is 2, so maybe she is too old for this book. In all, I think there are better books out there and definitely better books by Sandra Boynton."
1,not what I ordered,"I just rated this before looking at it closely. Upon closer inspection it is not even the book I ordered (pictured online it is blue; mine is white). I suspect that the one I received is an early edition. It has a used price tag of 59 cents on the shabby cover. On the back cover, the original purchase price was 3.95, while my used Amazon price was 5.99. Also two pages are glued together. There is also water damage across the bottom. I am thinking twice about ordering used books in the future. I have never been this disappointed."
1,Bad Boynton Book,"I usually like Boynton books but I'm not a fan of this one. It's subject matter and writing is terrible. ""Blue hat, green hat, oops."" It's that same sentence repeated for about 6 pages, switching out hat for socks, pants and shoes. There is no story. There's nothing to teach my daughter from reading this book, nor anything that could spark creativity. It's just boring."
5,Great for early readers,"My 4 year old and 2 year old both love this book. The 4 year old is a beginning reader and has had this book memorized for years now. She is able to identify simple words as she recites the story. My two year old also has the book memorized and loves to pretend to read. Both of them call this story ""oops"" and laugh every time the turkey does something silly."
5,"Parent friendly, too","Like Dr. Seuss books, Boynton's little board books are cute enough not to generate nausea for a parent/grandparent who must read them repeatedly. Sturdy and appealingly colored."
3,Fun book but a little odd,"This is a cute book for teaching your child colors. It is fun but a little bit odd because each page has a couple of colors like ""Blue hat, Green Hat"" but then it has a Turkey that is wearing the hat someplace weird and it says ""oops"". My daughter is only one so she just like for you to read it and turn the pages so I still like to read it to her."
3,"Okay, but not exceptional","It's a cute book, but I don't think it deserves a 5/5 rating by close to 100 people. I had high hopes for the book, but was disappointed."
5,toddler loves this,"This book teaches colors, name of clthoes and toddlers and twos go crazzy for it."
5,if you like to hear your kids laugh...,"I bought this book for my 2 year old son because it had such great reviews. During the first reading he was absolutely hysterical with laughter. We read it another dozen or so times, cracking up all the while. My son already knows his colors, so he has fun pointing out the blue hat, green hat, etc. but the ""oops"" is what gets the laughs. And his laugh is so contageous, we have a great time reading this together. What a simply wonderful book."
4,Not my favorite but daughter still liked it,"This story didn't have the rhyming in it like most of her others she has written. When I read it to my daughter though and when the animal kept putting the clothes on wrong and said ""Oops"" I would say it loud surprising her and she thought it was funny and would start to point out where the clothing was suppose to go, so it was somewhat educational at least."
5,So sweet,Sandra Boynton's books are so much fun to share with little ones. They're easy to read (over and over again) and fun to look at. My girl wants to keep her Sandra Boynton books forever. She has about 25 of them and has memorized most of them.
5,Oops! She did it again!,"I am so impressed with these series of books from Sandra Boynton! I LOVE this book! Yeah, I know, it is supposed to be more about my kids, but let's not underestimate the importance of a parent truly enjoying what they are reading out loud to their child!!!This book is AWESOME! I think the turkey is hilarious in this book, and my children do too. I know my children like this book for themselves, but I think they also like how excited I get when they pick this book for me to read to them.Not only is this book witty, smart, and visually appealing, but it is educational as well. This book teaches colors, articles of clothing, and how NOT to dress! LOL! That can be VERY important!This book is a MUST, as well as ANY book from Sandra Boynton!!!"
5,"Blue Hat, Green Hat","All of Sandra Boynton's books are wonderful, but this one in particular made me laugh out loud. I'm not sure if it is because of the turkey, or if it is because the turkey is wearing his clothes all wrong, or both. It is definitely on my shelf of favorites.The book is the perfect size for little fingers to grab onto. It puts the child in charge of story time while teaching them what clothes go where. At the end of the book we know for sure that hats do not go on feet, that pants do not go on heads and that socks do not belong on arms.The illustrations are so great, from the detail of the animals to their facial expressions.The Ahgoo Review rating is definitely 5 out of 5.ahgooreview.blogspot.com"
5,Short and funny,"My 15 months old son is, since last week, asking me to read to him. I've read to him since he was 8 weeks and now is paying off!His very favorites from Sandra Boynton are The Going to Bed Book, and Moo, Baa, Lalala, but today I read this book to him and he started laughing at the 3rd page, then there was no one to stop him, and I had to read the book about 6 times before he got enough of it. Everytime I read it he would just laugh and laugh. I think this book is going to become his favorite now!"
5,Powerful narrative,"Ms. Staffel has used her obviously prodigous power as a narrative writer to present three generations of spellbinding people. This is a novel of people that have accepted their lives but refuse to allow their lives to overwhelm them. Were this not such a powerfully written work I would find it comparable to the writing of Carson McCullers, but it is not. This is a more beautifully conceived and intricately crafted book. I have read it twice and will read it again."
4,A great book for a book group,Our book group read and we had a very interesting discussion. I recommend it. She's a wonderful writer.
1,A complete disappointment,"Megan Staffel doesn't seem to think very highly of her readers. The German she uses in the book is a joke. She translates ""cuckoo"" with ""rooster"", gives the German uncle a woman's name, and invents nonsense like ""Sauerkraut Sandwiches"". Asides the lack of any intersting story line, there are typos in the book, and for the price this book sells, I'd expect at least some editing. But as said, Staffel can't even open up a dictionary for her book, so there's not much else to expect."
2,Speaker Bar,Very hard to mount the roll bar brackets. Unable to get the bolts through the fabric into the speaker bar. Had to make holes in the fabric in order to pas the bolts through to mount the brackets to the speaker. A hole lot of trouble considering the cost.
1,total idiots! missing 4 poles cant even assemble!!,total idiots! missing 4 poles cant even assemble!! what am i gonna do with this stuff now? its such a big package its not even worth returning just use for scrap !!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was just a piece of junk. The whole rack collapsed on me during a trade show. I was unable to hang my clothes properly. I barely got to use it for 30 minutes before it fell into pieces. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this hunk of junk. I wish I could rate this item without any stars but unfortunately I can't...
3,Needs Sturdier Base,"We liked this at first because we were able to store a lot of winter coats, dresses and suits on it. But the base frame snapped, rendering the entire thing useless. Besides this design flaw (a plastic base over tiny wheels for a load-bearing object isn't so smart) it WAS a great product."
2,Melted in the attic,"This was easy to put together and is rather sturdy, but in the heat of the attic it melted and fell apart."
1,Worthless,"This clothes rack has a nice design and is advertised to hold up to 200 pounds. However, the vertical support depends on a tiny plastic tab being pressed against a steel pole. This plastic tab is inside a plastic collar with a ""locking"" mechanism that is 100% inadequate. I only had shirts hanging on the rack and multiple times the upper vertical pole telescoped itself into the lower vertical pole.After ""locking"" the tab several times, the collar cracked and now the closed position is all that is available for hanging and the shirts almost touch the floor. Don't waste your money!! I'm just sorry it's past the return period."
3,Organizer Needs Bracing,"It assembled very quickly and appeared to be working fine. However, over time, it has developed a significant list to one side, despite our having removed more and more garments to try to correct the situation. It obviously needs better bracing. Fastening it to the wall would also help (but this is not an option)."
2,Double adjustment rack,"Item arrived on time as expected. Easy assembly and no tools required. After loading rack with clothes, I noticed a crack in the plastic which supports the weight of the of the rack. The crack appeared in 4 locations rendering the use of the rack to only its lowest position. I had originally purchased a similar rack from a local retailer and have not had this cracking problem. I believe it is because the plastic is much thicker."
2,Meh.,"It's okay... looks sort of chintzy and not made well. But heck, it's cheap, right? Be careful of how much stuff you put on it, it's not made to hold a huge amount of clothes. When mine arrived, it had a broken wheel. Maybe yours will arrive with all the wheels intact. All in all, I would say my life would've been just a little better if I'd chosen a different product."
1,Not worth $1,"I can't believe anyone can look themselves in the mirror everyday selling this product - they are stealing your money. It is so cheap that it can not even hold up the weight of itself. You are suppose to be able to adjust the height in order to hang clothes. Before you can even hang clothes the bars slides down. I had to use duct tape abour the bar to prevent it from sliding. The locking mechanism for the height adjustment is cheap plastic and as soon as I hung clothes on the rack, the cheap plastic mechanism broke in half. This rack didn't even last 1 hour!!!!! Don't buy this piece of junk."
5,Handy,I bought this for my mom who has issues with her shoulders making reaching difficult. This is great as she can lower it so it is within her reach. I like it also because of the double bars and shoe rack on the bottom which others don't have. It makes good use of floor space.
3,More soldier then soul,"Soul Blues takes advantage of Hawkins's ability to weave at such a slinky pace, unfortunately much of the rest, while decent, is unable to solo out of predictability."
5,"Moving, Powerful CD","I have become a big Fernando Ortega fan because of his moving lyrics, calming melodies, and inspirational music. This CD is one example of Ortega's outstanding contribution to Christian music. I love it!"
5,Hymns of Worship,I love this CD! It is extremely worshipful and beautifully arranged. Mr. Ortega could not have done a better job with these familiar (and new) songs. I listen to it while I'm unwinding or working on other things and it is a great accompaniment. No weak songs are on this one!
5,The way learning should be,My little boy loves this book and has loved it since he was a year and a half old. It combines great pictures that have lots of action with action words that really grab a kids attention and without any effort they learn their ABC's along with the words. For little boys especially I think they enjoy things more that come with a sound track and this fits the bill perfectly.
4,Great buckle & seller,"Ordered this belt buckle as part of my boyfriend's Christmas gift. It is a great product, not the highest quality, but it is pretty solid. Also, kudos to the seller (2bhip) for getting it in before Christmas and promptly posting tracking information."
3,Miss Eartha is Blond,"This is a wacky one from 1979 which will probably not make it to DVD. It takes place in the Florida keys. The highlight is Miss Eartha Kitt as Lola, not perched on a barrel, but in a blond wig and purring her way through some tacky numbers. The bi husler with the butterfly patch on his jeans is a riot as well as Barbara Baxley as a socialite who uses his services. Tom Ewell, former co-star of Mansfield and Monroe, has a comeo role.It is directed by famed adult film maker Bob Chinn, who directed some of john Holmes most memorial films.Maybe this was his stab at the big time. He failed- luckily for us camp film lovers. Silly fun soap opera with a hunky star who can't act and never wen't on to anything much."
3,"Eartha Kitt's in it , that's enough !!!","I bought this video, because Eartha Kitt acts and SINGS in it , and with a spectacular , bizarre WHITE wig on !SHE 's always fun!For me, as a fan of Eartha's, that was more than enough .Story is a thin one. Matt Collins is a goodlooking hot'n juicy hustler(or should i say GOLDDIGGER ?) Altogether not so bad, but definately NOT an A or even B-movie. Dated too ( it's from 1997!)Fans of Eartha should definately buy this one though."
2,"Tedious, sterotypical and one sided","This novel has a great title. But, some of the intertwined characters that were fleshed out were absolutely cruel and unlikeable, others so unidimensional, that I didn't really want to know more about them, and didn't care as much as I should what happened to them. Donna and Peter deserved each other. What was there to like about Mike? I, too, was reminded of Margaret Atwood's style when reading this, but she's not one of my favorites either. To be fair, perhaps to really appreciate this book you had to have read it during the era in which it was written."
5,Great collection!,"This is a great collection of Martha's many popular hits with some new songs included too. I love this album! The only songs I think should've been left out would be ""Everybody Dance Now,"" ""Come,"" and ""It's Raining Men."" I 'm really not too fond of those songs, and I usually skip them. Songs like ""Leave A Light On,"" ""I Found Love (C+C Club Mix),"" ""Gonna Love You Over,"" ""So What'cha Gonna Do"" and ""Just Us"" should have also been included in this collection, so why weren't they?? I don't understand. Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good collection. My personal favorites are ""God Bless The Road (That Leads Me Home),"" ""Takin' Over (Feel The Groove),"" ""Catch The Light,"" and ""Keep On Jumpin'."" They're great songs and really show off Martha's talented singing ability. She's one hell of a singer and can definately belt it out. This is a must have for any music lover or true fan of dance music. Don't hesitate to get this great collection!"
4,"Incomplete, but wonderful collection of true vocal talent","I have to agree that ""The Collection"" is an incomplete compilation of the works of one of the most talented vocal artists of this or any generation. Martha has the talent and range to go from soft ballad delivery to a belting club phenomenon in the blink of an eye. It's true, there are many great songs that are not represented here, but one that is, and my personal favorite is ""God Bless the Road"". This song will truly set you free. It lets you in easy with ballad-style vocals, and steadily increases till you find yourself engulfed in a movement worthy of any chorale concert. What's true of all songs on ""The Collection"" is that Martha delivers each one like nobody else would ever attempt to. Buy it, and despite it's shortcomings (which have nothing to do with her talent) you'll still love it."
1,Horrible execution,You're in front of some of the greatest investors of our time and you ask them what a P/E is?
1,"I would rate this a ""sell""","I bought this book hoping to learn some real insights. What I learned is that this author understands little about investing, and doesn't have a clue how to ask the right questions."
1,Not worth the money,"I have read all the investing books, and this might be the worst. My favorite one is: ""Secrets of the Wealth Makers: Top Money Managers Reveal Their Investing Wisdom""--at least the author knows what he's talking about."
2,Interesting History but Too Lightweight for Investing,"If you're looking for deep investing insights from the masters, this is the wrong book. The author seems to have missed a golden opportunity to ask good fundamental questions and then pursue them more deeply.If you're looking for short biographies of famous investors, coupled with a high level discussion of investing philosophy this is the right book."
1,awful awful awful,"this is the worst investing book i have ever read. this guy managed to get 20 great investors like Marty Whitman to participate. . .and the best he could do was ask every single person the same dumb questions about P/E ratio and book value. what a painful and frustrating read. kazanjian manages to pull nothing insightful, nothing interesting, and nothing even remotely personal out of these interviews. this is an awful book that gives us nothing but 20 case-studies in bad journalism."
1,Nothing Profound,"It is a bit promotional, giving the interviewees a chance to boast. I didn't like the interview format because the author didn't ask in-depth questions."
1,I returned this book,"I expected far more than what this book had to offer. Surprisingly, the author didn't really ask questions that examined and probed these successful value managers. This was really a shame because he had their attention, and he had my money before I returned the book."
1,Where's the Beef?,"The author picked some great money managers. He could have picked better questions to ask them. I would think that as long as you're in front of these stars you would ask some intriguing questions and seek their insights. Without the right questions and probing, you'll never find their secrets."
1,Big Disappointment,I was hoping for some real insights into these professionals. Instead I read about the current markets of two years ago!
1,I was very disappointed,"This book doesn't have any substantial information--it focuses too much on current markets, which was a year or two ago when it was written."
3,Cheap Costume,My daughter is almost 5 and is tall for her age. I ordered the 6-8 since you never know how the item runs (large or small). This dress was Huge. The material is Very cheap. The first time she tried it on the ribbons that tie in the back started tearing away from the dress so I had to sew them back on. She ended up looking beautiful once we hemmed 6 inches at the bottom and fixed the dress. We had no problems with the order and it arrived quickly but overall we were disappointed with the poor quality.
5,What the Doctor Ordered!,"If you are using the Tomcat, MySQL, JSP configuration, this book is the absolute perfect marriage of these technologies. It covers every aspect of the implementation. It is required, however, that you do have a little background in 1 or more of these technologies. The examples are excellent and at times the book is a lighthearted read. Kudos to the author."
3,"Beautiful presentation, inconsistent content.","This guide is beautifully set out, and a must-have for Soul Calibur fans who like to ogle the gorgeous characters (without leaving unsightly smears on their screens). The summaries of character strengths and weaknesses are fun to nod along to and murmur sounds of agreement. Unfortunately, there's no updated character biography, so it feels incomplete, but the setting out of main moves for each character is a nice feature. My main quibble with this guide is the stats page for the weapons. It's an unwieldly fold-out page, and the stats provided are inconsistent, and in most cases non-existent. The bonus soundtrack CD is quite decent, and a good alternative to ordering a much more expensive import over the net."
4,Hard drive style of banjo,"Alan Munde, in my opinion, he's the finest 5-strings banjo player in the world! He plays the instrument with precision, the sound it's clear and clean and distinctive.In these recording you will have the pleasure to hear the virtuosic picking, and inventive arrangements."
5,Like A John Wayne Movie,"This is the funniest western I've ever read! My favorite along with Lonesome Dove. I love his country sayings. I laughed out loud and was sorry that the book ended. Didn't know this book existed until I stumbled onto it in a library. A Lewis book is like a John Wayne movie, based on history, spurred with suspense and spiced with humor. The perfect formula for any book. I'd love to have the Lomax set! Why are they out of print???"
4,The great jazz messengers,"One I forgot to add to my jazz collection, but now recovered. It's a must have and jazz at its best."
5,Excellent in every way,"This recording features a front line horn section of Curtis Fuller, Wayne Shorter, and Freddie Hubbard. All are very exciting. Blakey and Workman do a fine job. The tunes are unusual and Cedar Walton adds some wonderful material. I think the Walton is often under-rated. Get this record. You will not regret it. It is every bit as good as any of Blakey's best Blue Note recordings from the 1960's."
1,Student Work,"With a desert landscape, I wanted to add some beauty with this stake.Unfortunately, when it arrived today, my disappointment was expressed as UGH!It does not look like the picture (this is ok) but the quality and workmanship is substandard. If I had ordered this item from a copper tooling school where students were learning how to work with copper, then it would have been an acceptable quality.Since, I have ordered other items from Amazon.com which have been of superb quality, I will continue to shop here!"
5,This is a powerful book,"I picked this book up thinking it might help me with some time management issues. It went way beyond -- it is literally life-changing, because it shows that what we need to manage is not so much our time, but our priorities in life. The exercises are amazingly revealing and the advice is right on target."
4,Using the Lancets,"Just a tip for other people with thick blood. I have found that I get better results if I use both lancets immediately. That is I don't use one, squeeze until I run out of blood and then use the other. Instead, I jab myself twice right away. The blood seems to flow better and I can usually get all the circles filled in that way. Also it helps to warm your hand and stand up while you are trying to squeeze the blood out of your finger."
1,Slooow Response,"This product is a blood lipids test where samples are summitted, lab tested and results returned via mail. I mailed the samples approximately one month ago and still have NOT received the test results. Very slooow or, worse yet, perhaps no result will be sent."
1,6 weeks later... No results,"Though the BioSafe packaging claims your order will be processed in days, I haven't heard a peep after 6 weeks. I just tracked my order online, and they claim the lab just received the sample 3 days ago. I'm extremely skeptical that a 1.5 month old sample can be analyzed with accuracy, though I'm not sure these folks could accurately analyze a 1-day-old sample after reading the other reviews (plus that first five-star review on here is so obviously someone from the company, it's gross). The website is also covered in misspellings and bad grammar, which doesn't exactly speak well for the company and their professionalism. I feel like such a sucker."
5,Cholesterol panel at-home testing,Very convenient for at home testing for those who wish to track their results on a more frequent schedule than their doctor's visits. Instructions are easy to follow and results are sent in a timely manner. The company also can build a profile so buyers can see their results over an extended time period.
4,Modern kicks,"Zippy punk served up '77 style, from the shoutalong girl-group-derived melodies to the dayglo cover art to a mix that boasts all meters buried in the red. Lotsa fun, in other words, if just shy of greatness. Full marks for effort, though. This is what punk rock sounded like before it got codified into simple barre chords and zitty whining. If you've ever heard the Vibrator's classic ""Pure Mania"" then you're already well-acquainted with the game plan. And although it's all highly derivative, the Exploding Hearts at least show good sense and smart album collections in their choice of idols. It also helps that the band possesses an infectious exuberance and a seemingly limitless energy supply. With any luck, a million and one Good Charlotte-lovin' teenie punks will clutch onto this as their favorite album ever and all their subsequent bands will be formed in the image of the Exploding Hearts. And then the world will be a better place. Or something."
5,Great Album,"This is a great album. If you love rock and roll, punk rock, or hell, any good music at all - buy this CD. Every song is so catchy and fresh that you'll want to listen to the tracks over and over again. This is real punk rock and roll, and if you love guitars and good times, then this is a must buy."
5,can't be put into words,"literally, this cd is just amazing. you will be hooked after one listen, guaranteed. i can't think of any cd more deserving of your money right now. it really is a tragedy 3 of the 4 of them died so young in a recent car accident, i know they would've been great. do yourself a favor and buy this, you won't regret it.rip exploding heartsto the person a few reviews down, the tracklist can be found on interpunk.com, but ya might as well buy it ;)"
2,Uninspired...,Too religious and biased for my taste. Doesn't explain the Kabbalah as well as I thought. Just some personal opinions trying to convince the reader of biblical meths with scientific 'evidence.' His ideas are also very polarized and slanted towards the religious mind.
1,Not a book about Kabbalah at all,"This is a watered-down, overly simplified book about a subject worthy of much more serious and accurate commentary. The author has taken one tenet of Kabbalah (receiving for the sake of sharing) and basically written a whole book that repeats the same thing over and over. This is true of all of the books published by the Kabbalah Centre, an organization of questionable origins and fundraising methods. Beware of the underlying yet hidden message in this book-give the Kabbalah Centre your money and you will get more ""light"".Please do yourself a favor and read serious works by authentic Kabbalists like Rav Michael Laitman and Rav Yehuda Ashlag. This book trivializes Kabbalah and its true teachings."
4,not bad,"I don't think this is Michael Berg's best book, but it isn't a bad place to start your spiritual search."
4,Excellent book.,"I really liked this book. Michael Berg does a good job. Is Michael related to Yehuda Berg? I think so. Check out the ""Power of Kabbalah"" by Yehudah Berg. This is also a very good book.Also check out Peter Cayce's ""What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information."" Check out the reviews. Among other things, Cayce covers Kabbalah, reincarnation, and the fact that Jesus may have studied / practiced Kabbalah.What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information] -- by Peter Cayce"
2,Not an accurate study of Kabbalah,"True mastery and understanding of the kabbalah comes from years of study. Far too complicated and esoteric for the average Joe to get from one book; this is really more publicity for the ""Fad Faith"" practiced by the Kabbalah Centre. Celebrities should be aware that those red bracelets may be sending another message; girls with anorexia wear them on their left wrists to recognize each other in public."
5,The real WAY for people who want to change their WAY !,"I never really understood what is to change till I read this book. In a very light and remarkable way it describes what life is really about. In a very practical way it shows how each one of us can fit to this game of life, how to really change and become part of the way of life. A real genuine tool about really understanding who you are and how to accomplish a change in your life. I found it so real and so related to my personal life - it came exactly in the right time. If you really look to change yourself, and tired of other ways - this is THE WAY !"
5,The Way by Michael Berg,What a powerfull and unexpected surprise. I couldnt put it down. From the second i began reading this book i was taken by the unique and simple presentation of the universal spiritual principal that it reveals. I have been searching for years for a book about Kabbalah that a novice like me could understand. I was very moved by Michael Bergs analogies and i think anybody intrested in spirituality in general would gain by reading this book.
1,Ripped after 1 year of careful use,"I got this bag for my two children, and researched many bags before hand. I got this bag because it's stylish, and practicle. I also liked the inside stroller straps on it! However, the bag ripped after only on 15 months of use! I feel like a bag for $85 should not rip! It was also rather small, and I did not like that it had no zipper on the top, so anyone can look in your bag, and things fall out!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The Tellington TTouch for Happier, Healthier DogsThis DVD is homemade and created by your classic Snake Oil Salesman. And I was dumb enough to not only believe, but to purchase. I am writing this review so no one else wastes their hard-earned cash like I did. It is the most homemade DVD I have ever watched - love how she wears her 1980's jumpsuit, posing in front of a dirty wall with an outlet as her background. If you want to feel stupid, buy it. You will feel like the biggest loser like I did. You just have to laugh at how poorly it is made and her ""touch"" - basically massages and pets that we pretty much all give our dogs anyway. Give me a break. It should be taken off the market. YIKES."
2,An overly academic writing style,"The concepts are adequately explained with enough mention of real-world applications, but get ready to skim the unbelievable amount of text devoted to referencing other materials. The most annoying thing about this text is the constant references to thousands of other books and articles. It is also one of the most poorly indexed texts I have ever seen; good luck finding what you're looking for."
5,Neat little unit,"At the price I paid for this refurbished unit I figured I couldn't go wrong. It is just a neat little unit. Haven't used it much yet but am very happy with what I have seen. I am using it with a Mac, with OS 10.5.5. Software CD did not work, you have to download from the Brother website."
1,the printer did not work,"Buy the printer after reading the opinions of other shoppers, but the printer NEVER worked and I could not return it and send a gift to a person outside the U.S."
5,Great Labels,"Easy set up, easy to load and the software that comes with the lable maker makes it easy to use from word, excel or from the software its' self. Prints a good b/w photo as well. Would recommend to anyone that needs to make a lable for ant reson."
3,Bug Kit a Big Success,I purchased the CSI Forensic Kit for my 11 year old grandson. He loves bugs and really likes the kit. It is different than other bug collection kits that he has. He and his brother have rid my house and outdoor area of a variety of insects.
3,Very easily destroyed,"It's a nice toy, but Doberman destroyed this toy far faster than many others. Without playing/tugging with me - destroyed in two days on his own. If that's a concern, would not recommend.He still loves playing with the plastic squeaker he extracted from inside though. So in that way, I guess it was good for the money."
2,software user,"I've been using print shop for years, it has many bugs (still) so I was pretty excited to try this program. Unfortunatly I was really dissappointed. The graphics were OK but there is no way to search through them, you have to open a file and just scroll through all the graphics until you find one you might like, this becomes extemly time consuming. It did come with 2 extra disks of graphics but I don't have the patience to look through all the folders then open a CD and look through more. There is also no way to keep 2 pages open at the same time, so you can't jump back and see what you used on a previous page. Some of the starter pages are pretty cute but I really don't see myself using this program much anymore, I'll go back to Print Shop even with all it's glitches."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was over excited to get this product after reading the description, especially about the 500+ fonts it has, as I am a bit of a font freak... Well, after installing the program, I come to realize that there is no way to automatically install the entire program, including the fonts and graphics, without going in to each individual one and doing it manually. Not only is this time consuming, but really a pain in the butt. And, of these 500+ fonts, most of them are just variations of a traditional one, that you would be able to get yourself by simply using the bold or italic options. There were NO original or unique fonts, only a handful of script ones, and NONE that I would want to use on my style of scrapbook pages. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this product and only wish that I was able to read this kind of review before wasting my money on a product I will probably never use."
2,Way Too Cartoonish,"I wanted to boost the creativity and ""wow"" factor of my scrapbooks, so I decided to try Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 2.0. What a bitter disappointment!I kept thinking, ""Boy, this is hard to get started with!"" but as it turns out, I wasn't stuck in ""beginner mode"" - there was just nothing more available! I suppose this is a positive - it's certainly easy to learn.The graphics are all cartoonish. If you want to create an elegant scrapbook page, forget it. A rustic, outdoorsy page? Forget it. Effects like torn edges or crinkled paper or anything subtle at all? Forget it.This was not the software for me - just not my style. However, if you are the type who, for example, decorates your Christmas tree solely with licensed cartoon character ornaments and neon colors, you will probably adore Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 2.0. Since I can't return opened software, I plan to give it to my children and nephews - I'm certain they'll love creating silly door signs and coloring pages."
1,Don't Bother,"This program really disappointed me. The graphics are so cheesy and cartoon-like - nothing I'd feel proud printing and showing to friends and family. The art reminded me of 'Print Shop' greeting cards from the early 90's. I couldn't find enough appropriate artwork to make more than two scrapbook pages.I recommend 'Simple Scrapbook Boutique' instead. 'Simple Scrapbook Boutique's artwork is stylish and contemporary, and the designs remind me of Martha Stewart's line of scrapbooking supplies."
5,Dragonfly stake,"This item is BIG, and very pretty. I left it out all winter, and it made it through very well, with no rust. Would definitely buy again!"
2,Not Worth It Unless You Need Cheap Copper Pieces,I received this product as a bonus for buying the Lg Woodstock P. Garden Bells. I like it more than the Garden Bells but it is still a really crude lawn ornament. The product design is crude. The actual dragonfly in the picture looks far more detailed and polished than the product I received. The copper is decent and if your garden features copper this might be a nice addition.
2,not impressed!,"The fan is very noisy, even on low. The small screws used to assemble the fan were almost impossible to put in place. Very cheap/like fan-would not advise anyone to buy it."
2,First and last westinghouse...,"The noise!! It's not rattling nor rubbing, nothing externally off balance. It's all internal. The sound you get when the magnets and the rotors are not aligned. It's awful... worse on lower speeds. rotors designed wrong?!? Contrary to other reviews, it dosen't move air better than a 52 inch.... not even close. It vibrates too... this was installed in my finished basement and the flush mount made it so the rotor vibration was louder upstairs than it was in the basement. Moving to a seldom used bedroom and putting the old one back in."
3,Defective light switch,"The fan works fine....but after installing, it was determined the light switch did not work. This caused a lot of extra work....getting a replacement switch (which was done without a hassle)."
1,Used fan purchased from Amazon,Beautiful fan but when I received it it was missing on of the most important parts; the base which you hang the fan from. It cost me half the purchase price to return it so I am in the whole because of this pruchase
3,Westinghouse ceiling fan/light,"This product required 80 minutes installation time by a professional, and one of the glass globes arrived broken. Otherwise, it seems to work well."
2,Noisy,"I was hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones, but my brand new fan is making an annoying noise like a metal sound all the time. I paid $50 for someone to remove my broken ceiling fan & put up this new one. I read several other reviews & took a screwdriver myself up on a stepstool but all screws were tight. Maybe something is hitting inside but I can't afford $100 for a licensed electrician to find out. The person who I paid $50 had also put up my broken fan 7 years ago, so he knows what he's doing. Maybe he made a small mistake but he's not willing to spend another hour to find out. Or maybe it's a cheap fan & I should have spent 3x as much for better quality. I'm so upset I can't even turn it on anymore cause the noise is so annoying. And, I wasted an additional $34 on 3 cfl candelabra based bulbs. I just can't afford to hire someone take it down to return it & then pay another time to install a different model."
1,Does no last!,"Westinghouse 7850900 ceiling fan. I purchased this on December 19, 2011 it is now June of 2012. The fan started to make noise about two months ago. Now it slows down and will even stop for a moment or two by itsewlf. I will need to replace this fan soon. I cannot recommend it even at the great price I payed for it. The last fan I had lasted 21 years and was still working when I replaced it with this one. You get what yo pay for."
1,Very poor air flow,"This is a nice-looking fan. And very quiet, but it produces almost zero airflow. It is time to replace it."
3,ceiling fan review,I bought the 42-inch Westinghouse ceiling fan and it is very quite and and looks really nice. I didn't realize how big it makes my room look. The fan is small but provides a well suround airflow.
1,"Quiet, but produces almost no air at all","This is a nice-looking fan, and it's fairly quiet, but it produces almost zero airflow. Before you ask, yes, I've checked, and it is turning in the right direction. It turns quickly enough, but something (the blades might be at the wrong angle?) keeps it from doing any good at all.Also, as mentioned before, it takes candelabra bulbs, not standard, so be prepared for that. It's really a nice fan, and maybe if the blades were adjustable, it would be worth the money. But they're not, so don't expect it to cool you down at all."
2,Loud fan noise - annoying,"Installed one of the four fans I ordered in a play room. The unit emits a loud, low frequency hum that is vey annoying. I returned the three others that were destined for bedrooms. The hum would definitely keep me from going to sleep. I think that the noise level emitted by these fans should be included in the description so that buyers can make an informed decision for their application. For me, the noise level is tolerable in a play room but unacceptable for a bedroom or a media room."
1,Don't do it,"The seller of this product is wonderful. It's the fan itsself that has many problems. It's hard to install and very noisy when it runs.Once again ------------the sellers are wonderful folks, just don't purchase this particular fan."
2,bad light kit,"The fan is nicelooking,fairly quiet.But it does NOT take standard base light bulbs as described,it takes candelabra based.After installation,we discovered the light fixture is defective because one of the glass globes does not fit properly, one of the sockets extend out too far,was not visible until we tried putting the glass globes on after we paid an electrician to install it.I called Westinghouse for replacement of the light kit and they said we would have to take the whole fan down, send it back and exchange it for another whole unit.They should send us a light fixture replacement,but wont. BAD SERVICE AND POOR QUALITY CONTROL from westinghouse, Not willing to stand by their guarantee to replace defective or missing parts as in manual."
3,Bad description,"FYI, It doesnt use standard light bulbs, it uses candelabra type bulbs. Its quiet, works well. Quality seemed fine to me and came with extra parts like screws and such."
3,They lied about standard bulbs,"The fan is ok for the price, but I would not have purchased them if I had been told the truth that they don't take standard bulbs. Booo Westinghouse ,now after installing them I can't put energy saver bulbs"
1,Unacceptable quality,This fan looked good enough but it sounded like it had loose marbles inside it when it was on low speed. I returned it.
3,Nice Fan but no support from MFG,"Bought 2 fans which were very nice looking and easy to install. Have only used for about 2 weeks. However, one of the light shades arrived chipped and the Westinghouse has not responded after submitting several forms on their website to get it replaced."
3,what u pay is what u get,"Item arrived in time. Is not a bad buy for the money. Pretty easy to put together. Nice looks. Only 2 things I can complain about. One of the glasses came broken in pieces. Amazon had to send another fan so I can take a good glass out of the box and return the second fan back. They paid for shipping. They couldn't just replace the glass. Well, in the end it worked out w/o too many head aches. The Amazon customer service was very nice and efficient in solving the problem. Second complain I have, it's a bit noisy on the low speed when it's quiet in the house, during the night. It has something to do with the glasses. When I touch the glasses and hold them firm, the noise stops. Not a very big deal, I can sleep well anyway. Overall, I'm happy with what I got for the money I paid."
4,Easiest to install (& cheapest!) compared to 3 different ceiling fan brands I purchased.,This one was very easy to install and it was the cheapest of the 3 fans I purchased. Hunter and Hampton Bay R&D may need to look at this design. It was that easy to install compared to those expensive fans!
3,"Not bad, Not good","Purchased the fans to install into our new home we had built. Upon receipt of the packaged, one of the light fixtures were broken. Installation instructions were easy to follow. However I noticed that the fan makes a loud knocking noise when it's turned on.:( It's to late to return."
4,What you will not realize,"The fan itself is actually quite nice for the money and fit my application perfectly. All was going great until I realized that the fan used E12 bulbs which are only available in LED form locally. Needless to say, I did not expect to pay as much for the bulbs as I did the fan. I could have opted for an adapter which would have looked funny but reduced the price. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to buy bulbs that will probably outlive the fan. Unamused."
2,Buyer beware! Picture is misleading,"The second picture, showing the fan in a bedroom, is quite misleading. The fan is actually quite small, and it does not have an extension rod to extend it from the ceiling. This means that if you live in a fairly new house with high ceilings, the fan is essentially useless."
3,"Nice, quiet and easy to install","Fan was a great buy and i bought 2 of them for bedrooms. I recieved them in 2 days. However during installation, i realized that the blade screws included are about 1/4"" too long, therefore all the blades wobble when installed. I imeediately realized that this wa snot normal. I had to use the 15 of the 16 nuts included (which are not called for installation anywehre in the manual), screw them in the blade screws, then screw the blades in. This is how i fixed the 1/4"" problem. I thought it was just me, but one of the reviewers here posted the same problem. Besides that, hope it works fine for years to come. These were $30 more at HD. Hope they stay quiet as well."
3,Decent for the price,"This fan was easy to assemble. When first turned on, it made a grinding noise. Not wanting to detach, disassemble, and exchange, I left it running for several hours and the noise eventually went away."
5,Better than what I had,"I bought this fan when I decided to change the light in my kitchen for a fan. I wanted it to still look nice but, I needed some air flow. I think this fan looks and feels great. I liked it so much I bought another one for my living area And, they both work so much better than what I had. They are silent, easy to put up, and just look nice! so I would say if you are looking for a new fan to highly consider this one."
5,nice fan,"Very nice fan. Easy install did my self alone on high ceilings im 5'7 150 male. the only thing is that my ceilings are so high i wish i had gotten a bigger 1 but i still feel the breeze on this and im sure when i start running the AC itll make a big difference. The pull strings are very short i have high ceilings and short height but ill string it up, lol and make it work! i love this fan its nice i feel the breeze and would reccommend to anyone. Good Luck Guys and Gals!"
1,false advertising,Be VERY careful to read the blurb as Westinghouse is deceptive. They advertise standard base bulbs as included. Wrong on both counts. You must go out and buy expensive chandelier bulbs which are unavailable in energy-saving form.I contacted Amazon but they refused to change their misleading description.Go for a more expensive fan.
1,i just bought a new to me used fan!!!,when i purchased this fan it was titled as new in the orginal box. WRONG! this fan has been installed before and is missing the hardware pack. also the wire nuts dont match and are already twisted onto the wires which have been striped prior to my delivery. i am not happy about this. oh yeah and i bought this for a customer and attempted to install it now at $4 a gallon i have to make another trip at no charge to finish the job once i get the missing parts from westinghouse. :( the next time i buy it will be from ebay instead of amazon so that way i have someone to address with my issues!
1,looks good by noisy!,it makes the old sound that an old fan in an old house makes. We will just get rid of it. Too bad it looks nice.
5,Product as described,"This product just as it said it would be. It was very easy to put up too. It only takes decorative lights and at first I thought I wouldn't like that, but its PLENTY of light and it looks a lot nicer than those big bulbs that my other ceiling fans had. I will be purchasing more of these for the rest of my house."
4,Exceeded expectation,After reading the reviews I expected to have problems with the fan - not so! A friend with expertise in electronics put up the fan without a problem (we did have to get wall screws-832-instead of wood screws that came with the fan) other than that is was a breeze - pun intended!
4,Great price great fan but difficult to setup,"It was impossible for me to install this fan completely by myself, I was forced to beg somebody to help do it for me. I simply could not figure it out for the life of me.This fan has an incredible 3 speeds as well as a summer and a winter setting. When placed on a low ceiling it actually has a pretty remarkable cooling effect as opposed to when its higher in which then it just circulates the air. I am saying this because I actually ended up buying two of them for different parts of my house.I hate the way air conditioner air is, giving me all sorts of sneezing attacks and whatnot. I prefer ceiling fans and open windows no matter how hot or cold it is outside.This fan serves its purpose and even provides a nice ambient light to any room you put it in my favorite being pure yellow light.4 stars all the way minus one because of the weird installation."
5,Great product!,"This fan is the quietest fan in the house. Great product and a great price, too! I would definitely recommend this product."
3,em,"It was easy to install and looks great in my daughter's room. However, one of the the light covers shattered on it's own and now I have to replace all three glass light covers. No big deal with the bulbs, just get the right ones. I don't notice a humming sound as mentioned by some other reviewers and it works rather well in cooling the entire room. I am pleased with the purchase overall."
4,Prety much what I expected,"I wasn't expecting anything amazing from this fan for it's price. I needed something small and fairly quiet for my bedroom and this fan is perfect for that. It was easy to install and it pushes a decent amount of air for it's small size.It does use smaller, chandelier-type bulbs, but after I got 3 60w bulbs it puts out a good amount of light.If you need a small ceiling fan for a low price, go for this one."
4,Nice fan,Very nice looking fan. My only complaint... the metals arms that attach the blades to the motor came improperly drilled. I had to wait 3-4 weeks for Westinghouse to send new arms.
2,Junk,I have installed many ceiling fans and this is the poorest quality fans I have dealt with. The product you get is not the same as avertised. The bulbs are not standard and the light kits are very cheaply made. I had to replace the light kits on both the fans I ordered. I didn't even try return as I did not want to take the fans down and ship them back just to replace the light kits. I would not recommend buying this fan. Quality is not comparable to other fans I have installed in this price range.
2,Innacurate description,"I ordered one and when it arrived, the lights were candelabra base. Customer service had another shipped to me and it was the same. Do not buy this if you want standard base bulbs. I asked customer service to have the description fixed and they said they couldn't, but they did confirm that none of the fans came with standard base bulbs."
3,Looks good but...,"It is a bit noisy. Even with a bit of modification, it still hums. The light kit on mine was standard."
2,okay but can be better,It makes too much noise and it is starting to annoy me I will never buy another product from this company
3,Lid came cracked,"Basic box made of cheap plastic. The lid was cracked when I received it. It's not completely broken & still useable, but buyer beware. Don't set your expectations too high."
4,Lots of fun!,"These markers are super fun and are great quality. But watch out - the tops can come off kind of easily in a pencil bag, so be sure to check that they are on tightly to prevent ink from bleeding onto things."
5,LOVE 'EM,I love my Mr. Sketch Stix!!!! I have the fat ones in my classroom and now I have the Stix both at home and at school for correcting student work. These are wonderful and I am certain I will be getting them again and again!
3,Mr. Sketch Scented Markers,I work with markers on a daily basis and I grew up with Mr. Sketch Scented Markers. I didn't realize until now that they made a skinny version. They are nice to use to write with..I love the different scents. They aren't as strong smelling as the original sized ones but you still get a whiff when using them.
1,Not RV Related,"The title of this book is deceptive. The author's major RV experience was in driving an 18' motorhome and she definately feels that anything larger is more like staying at home than camping. If you are interested in RV related material, this book is not for you. If you want a so so travelogue with minimal information about where to park your RV, you might like the book. The author obviously has no experience in using RVs in urban environments--something than most owners of large RVs do on a routine basis. I think the title is highly misleading."
5,We are the envy of the neighborhood,Great little wagon!! The canopy is nice and the fold down seats are very useful!
4,A great wagon to take around the block,"We got this wagon for my son's first birthday, because we knew there would be many occassions that he would enjoy being toted around in a wagon. This is a great wagon for taking around the block or anywhere that it is going to be on flat land, such as paved roads, sidewalks, etc. The tires are pretty much plastic, even though they say they are rubber. You would not want this wagon for taking walks through any type of rough terrain, because it would make for an uncomfortable trip. It would be nice to add some padding to the seats to make it more comfortable for the kids, but overall it is a great wagon and my son loves it. I am looking forward to taking him around in it for Halloween."
5,IN LOVE,"I received mine in 2 days!!!! We were so excited. This is for my 20 month old daughter. She is so happy with this and loves this much better than the stroller. It is pretty durable and stable during our walks. I live in Arizona so it can get pretty hot! It is really nice to have the canopy to protect from the sun.Honestly, it was worth every dime!! It is great to take to the zoo, park, and craft activities!The wagon has so much room for a toys, food, and carry items. My only issue is that the holders do not fit sippy cups for toddlers.I could not find this anywhere in the store! But you can always count on Amazon to not only have it in stock but to get it shipped FAST!!!"
5,wonderful Wagon,"We love this wagon. My son has been using it since he was 9-months old. We take it to the zoo, and around the block. Great for 2 kids too. The canopy works fine for us. I rated it 3 stars for educational because the child just sits and rides. Our son is learning while riding though. Not too hard to put together."
2,Very disappointed,"Unfortunately we are very disappointed with this wagon. When we first received the box we suspected that this might have been returned by a previous owner by the looks of the packaging. The wagon was missing some parts, however Radio Flyer quickly sent them after a quick phone call. Now the canopy won't snap it securely to the wagon on two of the four sides. I can't put my one year old in one of the seats because he will pull the canopy out. I have to stop the wagon every few minutes and stick the sticks of the canopy back in the holes because they keep coming out. Overall, it just seems to be made very poorly and cheaply. Which is ashame, because my little boy loves it and it certainly wasn't the cheapest choice!"
3,Frustrating,"The most annoying thing about this wagon is that the handle falls down when you let go of it. So if you need to touch your children, the handle crashes loudly to the ground. Secondly, there is no storage space except for drinks. This means you will probably be carrying your purse around in addition to hauling two toddlers in a wagon. Side doors would have been nice on this wagon as it is hard for my 19 mos. old to get in and out. And lastly, mine didn't come with seatbelts, which would also have been nice for the same kid, but I'm sure I can call and get that thing fixed, but I'll probably just return this one and upgrade."
5,3 years old loves it,"it even flies of wett sand for clam digging. easy to clean, assemble, an definitely lots of envious people......goodbye stroller hello fun... did i mention it makes toting coolers,or just about anything a breeze."
5,JLM Rocks,This is a band with so much going for them that the world has not even begun to comprehend what they are going to do to the music scene. This is an album to throw on at a party and let everyone experiece the awesome talent these guys have.
1,can never have in stock even other companies.,Have tryed to order with many/Never instock.Dissapointed.
5,Prostate test,I was very pleased with the test. It came quickly and the instructions were clear and simple. Once I sent it in to Biosafe Laboratory the results came back within a couple of weeks.
1,Biosafe test versus regular lab test,I did biosafe PSA test and at the same time went to a local clinic and had another PSA test made the result that came from the local clinic was almost 40% higher than Biosafe result. I am completely confused are there differnt methods with different results??? which one is the correct one.!!!
1,"Biosafe Prostate Test, Purple (1 test)",It seems I never received this product but was charged for it. Can you give me a refund?
5,REAL...,"I haven't finished reading it, but so far, this book is very well written, it gives unbelievable descriptions and informations on the most popular gangsta rapper Tupac Shakur's life, family, friends, death, and his beefs with some others. It's a MUST GET for all Tupac Shakur fans, or just anyone, because it's a huge shock to the music world. Also to the US...fantastic job by Cathy Scott...peace :)"
4,Very much worth the read,"I place this book beside another three books on Tupac which I feel are must reads: [1] ""Back in the Day"" by Darrin Keith Bastfield, [2] ""Holler if you hear me"" by Michael Eric Dyson, and [3] ""Got your back"" by Frank Alexander. These three plus Cathy Scott's book paint a complete picture of his life and death. Cathy Scott's book is thoroughly researched but some facts that are commonly excepted as fact are expressed differently by her. It is evident in this book that she wishes she could talk about the investigation into Pac's death but the sad fact is that there is no investigation. Witness's refuse to cooperate and the incidents on the night of his death make the whole situation difficult for the police. Scott tries to circumvent this very hard but in the end she fails. The book also deals with the murders of Biggie, Orlando Anderson, Yafeu Fula and discusses how moronic the ""he is alive"" theories are as well. Very good book overall and a very quick read."
5,HE IS ALIVE,"Nice book, too bad he's alive. Isn't it obvious? The 7-day theory alone says it. Come on, All Eyez On Me is released on 02/13/96, and he dies 07/13/96? EXACTLY 7 months later? And he writes & records Don Killuminati in 7 days? And he was shot on 7th, 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 = 7 DAYS!@$ he died on 13th .. at 4:03 pm, 4+0+3 = .. duh! 7! He's alive every1.. returning in 2003 to prepare for the election campaign, when he changes the world truly .. oh yeah! All Eyez On Me, ""BOOK 1"" and ""BOOK 2"" .. hmm, what were Machiavelli's 2 Writings called? BOOK 1 and BOOK 2 .. :)"
3,very informative & straight to the point,"this book is a great book for someone who doen't know alot about ""the killing of tupac shakur"". i reccomend this book as a starter item for soon to be fans or fans that do not have any information about the killing. for a hard core 2PAC fan like myself its was a waste of my time reading info i already know."
3,Worth the 5 bucks,"This book went very indepth with the Night of the Shooting, and Investigation after the fact (slim to none investigation) of Pac's Demise. The book was full of little facts that I never knew and most likely the majority of Pac fans don't even know. Alot of the times this book sounded very redundant and went off onto other issues such as a chapter on Suge, a chapter on Biggie, etc. This book didn't really captivate me as the book Vibe put together did (5+ starz for Vibes joint). On the real, this book gives you interesting information you never knew and at 5 bucks you really can't go wrong if you are a true Pac fan, but don't expect to read this one until you fall asleep."
2,another white (wo) man hoax,"tupac may not be alive, but i doubt this woman would be the ""one"" to know. she talks about the obvious, making it seem like she is educated. as for the autopsy pic, it was a disgrace, she claims she could of sold it for 100,000 dollars, but she chose not to, and why would she? she made well more than that in this book. tupac was the greatest artist ever, and may he rest in peace"
3,"""BELIEVE THIS""","IF THERE IS NOTHING YOU ALL BELIEVE, BELIEVE THIS. EXIT TUPAC ENTER MAKAVELI. IT'S ALL TRUE MAKEVELI WILL BE BACK SOON. HE'S NOT GOD BUT HE WILL BE BACK. LISTEN TO CD 1 ON UNTIL THE END OF TIME NUMBER 7 WHAT DOES IT SAY ""I PLOT MY DEATH""------- TUPAC'S FAVORITE AUTHOR OF THE ART OF WAR STRATEGIES WAS TO FAKE YOUR DEATH AND THUS FOOL YOUR ENEMIES. SORRY TO SAY IT BUT DRE, JAY-Z WATCH OUT THE GREATEST IS SOON TO RETURN. ONE LOVE PAC WHEN YOU RETURN I WILL SUPPORT YOU AND I WILL SAY TOLD YOU SO.""THUG LIFE"" *TRU FAN Div@* -thats a thugs nature"
3,It was a good book,"I liked the book but some of it was what I had already known by looking online. It was insightful as to what happened to others such as Yafue Fula, Biggie Smalls etc. and makes you wonder what the motive for it really was. I did find a few discreptencies, but all in all I enjoyed the book very much. I think I would have liked to have seen more pictures of Tupac then what was there since it is about him."
4,Still more to be told...,"Kathy Scott has done some good research (although she still appears 'unfamiliar' with 2Pac and the rap scene at times), and deserves credit for the fact that this book is, on the whole, well written. Her big mistake is presenting the 'autopsy' picture and coroners report without really questioning the very suspect origins of the photo, and the incorrect details of the report. 'Pac really is gone (despite what some insist), but his legend lives on - and a legend as big as his deserves the whole truth to be publicly known. After reading this book and Frank Alexander's, I'm left feeling that there is still so much more which has to come out about the circumstances in the year before 'Pac died, as well as some wrongs said about him which have to be made right. 2Pac, wherever you are, keep ya' head up!, and rest in peace..."
5,An easy to follow account of a real life tragedy.,This book took me into a world I have never seen before. The book helped me understand some of the things that go on in the rap world. It is well-written and I would recommend it to anyone interested in humankind.
4,Cathy Scott did a good Job,"Im not gonna hate like some people. Cathy Scott made a good book with good investigating. Its really hard to make a book when there are no killers or suspects, and i think Cathy Scott did a great job showing what happen up to the moment he died and the aftermath of his death. Cathy Scott also has a book about Biggie's murder, i havent checked that out yet but im gonna."
5,tupac was a real talented person in my eyes.,you really should read all of his books you will find out things you never knew about him some good and some bad. but i think you will like what you read about him
3,A good book with shocking photos,"I picked up the book because I wanted to know more about his death. He was the greatest rapper of all time. Scott uses great details to to describe everything. I felt I was there. However, the worst part of the book is the autopsy photo. How humiliating must it be to the family of Tupac to have photos of a loved one all cut up and gruesome. Scott wrote a good book but definitely disrespected Tupac and his family. RIP Tupac. One love to Afeni"
4,"This book is pretty good, but","This book is adove average, but written by a person who has no clue about life in the ghetto(growing up and living there). The author always talks about how the Death Row entourage would'nt talk to the police, I would'nt either if the police treated me like that. Why tell the police, if you can deal with the problem better than the police can, retaliation."
3,Mystery,"When pac talks about being shot and coming back resurrected and asking if you think he died in his lyrics, he's reffering to his 1994 shooting in New York.Pac was a thug he knew he would die early, we all have to go sometime, he just got there a little quicker.Outlawz is whats keeping his music flowing, Yall just have to keep it real, face reality,I love pac, na mean? See yah on the otherside, peace out."
1,My dog could write a better book.,"The book had a few interesting points.But other than that I did not beleive most of the crap in it.I love tupac ,he is my favorite rapper but the book was unbeleivable i do not think tupac is dead and that book could never convnice me."
5,THE BEST,This is an excellent piece of work from Cathy Scott. She has indulged into the real happenings of Death Row and the investigation. Cathy Scott is not black but she has more knowledge and facts right about 2pac than some of these other so called authors such as Armond White. I recommend this book to any 2pac fan that wants to know the real. The picture gives evidence that 2pac is really dead and can no one dispute that.
1,Horrible,"She makes many mistakes in this book, and she is very disespectfull in my mind by posting the autopsy photo."
1,Wack as *?%@%@#*%&@,"this book is just a quick buck, if its about 2pac y does she talk about every thing else throughout the book? She acts like we dont know wut a gang is.. and that photo is wack, anyone in the movie bussiness can make that, or anyone with a nice scanner.and how did cathy scott get it in the first place. I dont think so.. and let us not forget its written by someone who writes for a tabloid, gee they never lie, this book is one big hoaxyou can fool some people sometimes, but you cant fool all the people all the time"
1,How can someone who NEVER Knew Pac write a book on him?,"Is this book a JOKE? 2Pac was 200+ pounds? Do some research lady. Your idea of 2Pac gaining that much weight in jail is a straight out LIE. He wasn't 6 ft either. Why is the autopsy photo so blurry? and WHY is it in Black and white? We got better pictures from when JFK was assasinated. If you are a 2Pac fan, or want to learn about his life, STAY AWAY from this book. Its Junk."
1,She should have left him alone,"I've read many books on Tupac. Cathy Scott accounts several things that contradict what everyone else has already stated as fact. The only new thing, that everyone already didn't know, she brought to the table was the autopsy photo. Which being a big Tupac fan, I could have lived my entire life without seeing. It took me two hours to read this book. I want those two hours of my life back!!!!!!"
2,OUR FEELINGS TO THE HERO OF THE RAP,TO MY BROTHER 2PAC I REALLY FEEL STRONG AS SOON AS I LESTEN TO YOUR SONGS MUSLIM PEOPLE LIK EYOU AND THEY CONSIDER YOU AS A MEMBER OF US .YOUR SONG (PANTHER POWER) IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONG I HAVE EVER LIKED I REPRESNT ALL OF MY FAMILY TO SAY PEACE AND LOVE TO YOUR SOUL AND YOUR MOTHER.
2,"looks nice, but don't be fooled","Good looking product, but drips within a few months.For the price, not very good.Will not recommend purchase"
4,Burst of italian flavour,"Received the first batch over a month ago and let me say that upon opening the first bag and trying my first piece it completely blew me away. Suffice to say that my waistline wasn't too happy but my taste buds were singing in flavour! I ate the whole bag in one sitting and from that point forth had to make a concerted effort to ration the remaining batch. Note, if not sold on this on their own try it in almost any soup, instant noodles and the flavour enhancement is sensational. Cheers."
4,Homes of American Royalty,"See my review for another listing of THE HOLLYWOOD STYLE by film historian Arthur Knight and LIFE magazine photographer Eliot Elisofon. This is a fun Time Capsule look at the homes of film stars, directors, producers, writers, etc. The coverage varies, but the homes of the following are among those included: Mary Pickford, Cecil B. De Mille, William S. Hart, Tony Curtis, Pamela Mason, Jennifer Jones, John Barrymore, Eddie Albert, Will Rogers, Edith Head, Rudy Vallee, George Cukor, Jean Negulesco, Ira Gershwin, Natalie Wood, Gypsy Rose Lee, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda, Rock Hudson, Bobby Darin, Richard Crenna, Eva Marie Saint, Elke Sommer, Charlton Heston, James Coburn and Steve McQueen. Too often the names of the architects and interior designers are omitted, but Hollywood favorites, Paul Williams, Tony Duquette, William Haines, Peter Shore, and even Welton Beckett are among those noted. This book will be appreciated most by fans of pre-1970 Hollywood."
3,good pump.,needs the magnet mount. i really don't think this pump puts out 1000 gph as stated. My tunze controlled pump puts out way more flow. but for the price it is a good pump. big though and i have it in a 75gallon tank
3,Who Did the Research for This DVD?,"In just looking at the cover for the DVD I'm wondering who did the research for it? The Britannic was near carbon-copy of the Titanic and yet the picture shows a more modern oil-powered ship with two stacks and not the four that these ships had. I'm a little disappointed that the History Channel let this obvious blooper slip. I hesitate to order the DVD because if this was so obviously missed, what else is wrong with the DVD? I gave it three stars mainly because I have seen previews and wasn't overly impressed."
1,Don't bother,"Marxist and post-modernistic verbiage from a cartographic historian who ought to have stuck to his area of expertise. This book is a mish-mash of politically correct essays on the evils of imperialism, racism, eurocentrism, etc. as expressed in maps. Harley was never one to let a trendy leftist ideology go unabsorbed and it shows in these tepid and unreadable essays. A fine example of what's wrong with contemporary academic thought."
2,Could have been better,"I am a huge Spider-Man fan. I know pretty much all there is to know about the wall crawler. I had just finished reading ""Spider-Man: The Darkest hours"" and was impressed. It was a great book. I decided that I would keep on the streak and move to this book.""Down these Mean Streets"" was a disapointment to me. The plot itself was very good, but the exacution was lacking. I encountered several spelling grammar errors which were not caught by the editor. There were also a few parts that were worded funny.All in all I'm giving it a 2/5. Like I said, good plot, but the writing in and of itself was lacking."
5,The best alblum of 2003 you didn't hear,"This record is one of the most rewarding CD's that I have. Its deep, but its not depressing. Its happy and dark at the same time. Kinda like Death to Smoochy. They are just as impressive, if not more so, live. You can definately hear some Flaming Lips influence. I guess they have that Oklahoma thing going on. This just barely tops Golden West, so to someone who has never heard Ester Drang before, I would suggest Infinite Keys."
4,Gets better every listen.,"...And it does!Ambient backgrounds and delicate arrangements. It's not as if Ester Drang are extremely original, but they're awfully good at their craft; Quite a bit different & better than most I've heard this year.I wouldn't say they're easily accessible, given their atypical structures, but for some, they'll fall nicely into the lap.On a side note, I'll say this is a quintessential night-driving album. Preferably by yourself...You'll want no distractions while enjoying this spacious album."
3,Take A Lot!,It works for me if I take about 8 capsules 2 hours before any sexual activity. I was more aroused and just plain horny after taking it. Hey its better and less fattening than oysters ;)
3,A Bit Biased?,"This book is great for reviewing a perspecitve on Hiroshima and the atomic bomb. I would use it for that. However, there are aspects to this book that are a bit controversial. The book talks about how the father dug up his son's bones. To me, that's not necessary. Also, one reason I feel this book is biased is because the father says that people always die in war and that it is a bad thing. We should let students and individuals make their own opinions and not be swayed by a book. The pictures are quite graphic, but do portray feelings of emotion. Before reading this book to children, one should think about what he/she is trying to say or what message he/she is putting out towards individuals"
3,Nice but missing something,"I don't like to buy audio products without going and checking them out in-person first, so I went and looked at and listened to the JVC EX-A10 at a local store. It sounds very nice. The wood speakers with real wood cones are beautiful and would be a conversation piece. I'm sure it would sound even better with a good subwoofer backing it up (using the included output on the back). However, the main flaw with this DVD stereo system, and the reason I didn't buy it, is that it does not have a DVI or HDMI output for plugging into an HDTV. DVI debuted in 1999 and HDMI debuted in 2003, so I cannot understand why JVC would fail to include this important feature on such a high-end DVD mini system. You can currently get HDMI outputs DVD players costing as little as $99, but not on this system - it only comes with analog video outputs. JVC, get up to speed and I'd buy this!"
1,Life's best lesson is to learn from others' experience...,"This ""Radius"" brand is utter junk...I should have listened to others instead of taking a risk. Two discs out of 25 are bad, and now that's a 8% failure rate. Now assuming each disc is stamped independently from each other and I randomly pick a disc from the spindle...each disc should have a 8% chance of being bad. On average each spindle will at least have 0 to 4 discs being bad...your take."
1,Faint Smell and Doesn't Last,"Maybe I got a watered down bottle?There is hardly any smell to this and 20 minutes after I apply it, even that is gone.I'm disappointed..."
2,"NON-INSULATED BOOTS SENT, does NOT match product description.","The boots received do not match the description on Amazon website. The product description reads: ""Certified steel toes, 200- gram Thinsulate or 400- gram Thinsulate Ultra Insulation..."". The boots I received were model #21210 (gray interiors) and per Danner, are NON-INSULATED.The 200 gram insulated boots have a maroon colored interior and are model #69210. The boots I received will be returned, unfortunately your customer service person told me there is no way to guaranty that a replacement pair of boots will be the correct model and I have to buy them elsewhere.Make sure you know exactly what you are getting before placing an order. Danner makes an outstanding boot but you will want one to match your needs!"
5,Great work boots,"This is my second pair of Acadia's from Danner and they are identical to the last pair. I work in construction and do concrete, and I'm terrible about cleaning/oiling my boots. The last pair still held up for three years, and for almost three hundred bucks I still think they are well worth it. As someone else pointed out you might have to buy better insoles, and the laces that came with the boots seem thinner compared to my last pairs. Great looking pair of boots all around, and it's nice that they're made in America. You can definitely tell the people crafting these take pride in their work."
3,Definitely Durable but still not that comfortable even after 3 year break in,"Cons-Extremely Stiff-Way to narrow-Long soles (like short snow skis)-Heavy-Squeaks at the ankles.Pros-Very DurableEven after 3 years, these boots are still taxing to wear. However like many others, my partners on duty love these boots."
4,Danner Men's Acadia,These boots are great! They look good and they are comfortable. Danner also offers reconditioning for this style after extensive use.
2,long break in,"I have had these boots for about 2 months (working 12 hour shifts) and they are still as stiff as the day I got them. Make a funny squeeking noise when I walk. Got the ""wides"" but still seem to be narrow."
2,"Well made, not very comfortable","This is a nice boot but it did not fit my feet very well. The foot bed is hard with not much arch support and the plastic orthotic inserts that came with the boots didn't help much either. I tried several types of insoles and arch supports but the bottom line is that they made my feet hurt and I returned them. It looks like a great boot and I can see where many people will probably like them but if you need cushioned support, you may want to look elsewhere."
