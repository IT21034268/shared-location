1,zzzzzzzzz,"An utterly boring subject on Kerouac. Hidden life? What do you expect? Gore Vidal, Capote et al surely approved."
2,not good enough,"i watched this movie just to c how much worser tha movie could get. still not funny enough. tha movie is better than part one. but not very funny. it had too much to do with breasts and stuff. which i find not fuuny. it funny in a crude way. which i dont find funny. i only laughed at tha superglue part!!! he gets his hand super glued to a porn tape and his "" man object"". u have to c that part but otherwise tha movie is....... not funny."
1,1 star = 1 laugh,"this movie was terrible. the dialog seemed as if it was written by a high school student, the plot devices were more than contrived, they were ridiculous. there was 1 good laugh in this movie. it was such a poorly made movie i had no desire to watch the extra features. i just wanted to get the dvd out of my player. thank god i rented this piece of garbage instead of buying it.if you liked the first one, you may like this. i thought the first one was marginally funny. i personally think i'm too intelligent for this movie. the humor was soporific and generally appeals to the LCD in everyone. it just so happens my LCD is way above most people Highest Common Denominator.whatever."
4,American Pie 2 (2001),"American Pie 2 starts out about a year after the original American Pie ended. Jim, Kevin, Finch, Stifler, and Oz have all returned home for the summer after finishing their first year of college. They don't really have a good place to party, so they decide to rent a summerhouse on the beach, and decide to cap off the end of summer with a huge bash.Most of the cast from the original returns. While there aren't too many jokes here we haven't already seen, but the movie itself is pretty entertaining. Highlights include the lesbian scene, and Jim's superglue incident."
4,Solid Sequel,"This movie may not be as uproariously funny as the original but it does seem to have more to say. Instead of being about a bunch of guys trying to get laid, this movie, at times, explores becoming an adult after high school. It's a fitting compliment to the first without trying to outdo it which would have been nearly impossible."
5,A VERY FUNNY SEQUEL TO AMERICAN PIE!,"I got a VCD of this movie from my friend (which was in terrible quality) and thought it was hilarious. I even invited a couple of girl friends over to watch it with me, and they liked it. I of course saw the R-Rated version and thought it was good. But now I have seen the Unrated version and it is 6 minutes funnier! Altogether this is an awesome DVD to own, with 10 hours of bonus features and it looks great in the full-frame format. I can't wait to own this movie!"
3,the sequel,"""American Pie 2"" has the gang from the first film back for more sex, drinking, partying, basically everything teenagers do in comedies these days.This time around they are in college, and of course, there is another humiliating scene for Jason Biggs, no baked products this time. You'll have to see it to find out.If you liked the first film, you will probably appreciate this one as much as I did. I liked it just as much as the first one. I laughed just as much here. 2001 was not the best year for movies, but this is one of the few that is tolerable and actually made me laugh. Worth the rental fee."
4,Not as Good as the original...But GOOD,"This movie is not as funny as the original but it is funny as hell. One reason you were not expecting the super funny stuff in the first one, but this one you were kind of expecting it so it took the element of surprise out of the movie (a little) But it is definitely worth owning if you liked the first one."
3,"The first one was better, but still a good movie to rent.","I really liked the first American Pie movie, and saw this one because I though that I would like it a lot too...but, I just found that the first movie was way better and funnier than this one. I recommend just renting it and not purchasing it."
4,A Better Pie,"American Pie 2 was an excellent sequel to the first American Pie movie. The story is pretty simple. Everyone's now in College, and for the Summer Vacation, the guys try to make it the best one Ever!To me AP2 is even better than the first. American Pie contained more of the everyday sexual encounters that teenage comedies now have. When I saw the first movie I wasn't really up for it because I already knew what was going to happen (except for the bedroom part). But, For American Pie 2, I was really surprised that even though it still had sexual situations (which I thought was even funnier that the first) it also had heart.It really made me realise that the characters have grown up and are taking things a bit more seriously. From their relationship with friends and family.This Second Pie is totally a must-see to anyone who's seen the first."
5,Hilarious with a Capital H!,"And, I thought the first one was funny! Well - the kids of ""American Pie"" have taken the jokes, gags and humor even farther in this sequel. Let's be honest - usually sequels are terrible. Rarely are they as good as the first, much less FUNNIER! Well - I must confess I loved this one even more. The guys are willing to take that joke just that much further and it's a great ride. The lack of the original girls is evident (they are hardly in it) but, it's the guys that are this movie anyway! Who doesn't love to watch Stifler? It's a gross out - sex feast at it's best! If you are in the mood for a hilarious ride - with very little room for thought (it's just plain OLE' fun) check out ""American Pie 2"". The collector's edition has some really great extra features - well, worth the cost!"
5,Good Old Classic,"good old classic. I was watching the series, so rented it out,good funny movie...not as good as the original and ofcourse not for young kids"
3,Better than the first....,"Aside from the extremely unnecessary lesbian scene, this one was actually tamer than the first, which made it easier to sit through. Basically, the guys from the first movie go to a lake house for the summer and party every night, get reaquainted with old friends, and get into trouble. Some scenes were hilarious. All in all, a good sequel. I enjoyed it, although, as with the first movie, I probably would not recommend it."
1,"Bad plot, bad acting, boring, etc...Just plain bad!!","Why do people make bad movies like American Pie 2? Must be because dopey people keep going to see and buying bad movies! This one isn't only boring, it is just plain dumb. The first one was just ""ok"" but the second one is really bad! Please save your money."
2,Cute In Spots but Overly Sophmoric,This sequel is definitely not a movie to take seriously. There are some good laughs especially in the opening scene when Jim's Dad interupts a sexual escapade by Jim. Eugene Levy undoubtedly is the highlight of this sequel.The rest of movie is just a non stop sequence of undersexed college/high school students striving to get laid. The characters are slightly amusing but the film as a whole does not add much to the more successful original. The script is oh so repetitive. Not bad but certainly not great either as a 2 1/2 star rating sounds right.
1,not worth the wait,"The first American Pie was interesting and done well. The plot wasn't that brilliant but the esemble cast was able to make a decent movie. However, American pie 2 falls short of its predecacor. The movie is weak at best. The whole creative team, directors, producers and writers seem to have lost tough with what made the original so great."
4,Have another slice.. won't you!,"You've seen the movies, you know what the Ameican Pie films are all about. A group of young people starting their adult lives. We have seen them in high school in the first one, now college with this second slice of pie. And the third film takes place after their first year of college. Where of course Jim & Michelle plan their wedding. I recommend the entire series. You should go for the unrated versions. The DVD's are loaded with extras. American Pie 2 takes the guys to a lake house for the summer of their lives, where they plan to party and get laid of course. Laugh out loud humor is the result as you get to know the characters a little more. Also one of the funniest moments in the trilogy.. Stifler's golden shower!"
2,Huge disappointment,"After thoroughly enjoying the first American Pie movie and reading all the positive reviews of this sequel, I came in with high hopes. Instead, all I got was a simple rehash of the same jokes from the first film, only this time, without the humor. It's as if the producers simply said ""okay, I want everything that worked in the first film repeated, only let's make it louder and even more obnoxious"". The only reason I give this two stars is because the entire cast at least attempts to inject some of the same spirit that they brought to the first film. Too bad the script lets them down, hard..."
4,excellent sequel,"American Pie 2 was something of a surprise, I didnt expect it to be as hilarious or as intelligently written and directed as the original American Pie. To say I was pleased with the overall movie is understating the fact enormously. After seeing American Pie 2 on the big screen I immediately went home and viewed the original American Pie and found the sequel has faithfully followed on and picked up where the original left us thirsting for more, it doesnt disappoint."
3,twice the pie,"very funny, very rude and crude , and if college boys in America are all about sex and little else as depicted in this film, then..well, thats too bad...Jim's dad was definately a highlight, and the original cast were all there, less innocent, more daring and more everything they were in the first. At times you might find yourself thinking 'okay..this is too much..'but the film quickly redeems itself when it finds it's heart again and regains some balance . A good helping of something else, like in scenes between Michelle and Jim . overall, a fun excursion for the under thirties."
2,Disappointing,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, having been in stitches of laughter over the first American Pie movie, and expecting some more of the same.Well, I got to see the movie, but was quite disappointed. I figure that if you are going to cash in on the fame of the first, you have to expect people to reflect & review.There was far too much reliance on crass humour, there was too much swearing, and the movie lacked any real flow.There were a few truly funny moments, but these were few & far between.Bottom line, watch it on weekly release at the local video store, have a laugh, but save your money something better.And, if you don't own the first release (American Pie 1), buy it."
1,Get a Plot!,"While watching this lame movie, I laughed only about 3 times. It uses only tired old sexual humor that I've seen a million times before. But the main problem is that its got absolutely no plot. I kept waiting for the story to start - it never did. Scary Movie 2 or even Bubble Boy were so much funnier and they had decent plots."
5,"""Wickedly Funny""","Budgeted at 30 millions dollars and eventually grossing over 260 million, ""Amercian Pie"" became a certified hit upon its release in the summer of 2001. The film centers on four best friends who embark on a camp during their first summer after their freshman year at college. Not Oscar worthy by any means, the movie is filled with sex crazed teenagers who drink and simply try to have a good time with hilarious results. Seann William Scott, who had a minor role in the original, steals the film as the funny and foul-mouthed Stifler and Scott would go on to a wonderful movie career because of this role. There are a ton of bonuses on the DVD including a documentary on the making of ""American Pie 2"", screen tests from the first ""American Pie"", videos, trailers, outtakes, and more. Even Ebert and Roeper give the movie ""Two Thumbs Up"". This movie would spawn three other sequels."
4,"If you liked the first one, you'll love this one","I'm a sucker for teen movies and this is sure to please everyone who even mildly enjoyed American Pie 1. Great to see the entire cast (even the monkey and the MILF guys!) back together. Tons of laughs and definately a fun, feel good movie. Can't wait for American Wedding!"
3,Alyson Hannigan Steals This Movie,"The dirty little secret of the ""American Pie"" movies is that underneath all the raunch they are very sweet and conventional about romantic love. This is embodied in the character of Michelle, the band geek, played by the great Alyson Hannigan (Willow from television's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."") Her role is expanded in this sequel, and Hannigan walks off with the whole movie under her arm. She's as sweet and goofy as Willow with way fewer inhibitions. She lustily helps Jason Biggs go after the exotic Shannon Elizabeth, all the while secretly pining for him herself. And she gets to deliver the film's moral: ""it's just sex"" and sex without love is meaningless. ""Uproarious"" and ""touching"" is a tricky combination, but Hannigan pulls it off with style."
2,Absolutely terrible,"I was so disappointed when I saw this movie. The original American Pie was so funny that I figured the second would be as well.While on summer vacation, the guys decide to rent a house by the beach. How predictable.. single, college freshman.. house on the beach.. This movie wasn't even funny, it was just dumb."
1,Sucked Beyond Sucking,"All I have to say is that this movie sucked. I liked the first one. However, this one was one of the worst films I have seen in a long time."
3,"I hate to admit it, but it's funny.","Really funny, actually-- I only gave it three stars because it was not nearly as good as the first one, nor as witty as I like comedies to be. But to suspend reality for an hour and a half, to put your worries aside, and laugh at the asinine jokes-- it's worth it. For all of you escapists out there, watch this movie."
4,Not RTF's strongest effort.,"Consisting of a 3-part 'suite' that is dispersed throughout the album, plus 5 other compositions, this is not the best laid out RTF album. Stan Clarke's 'Vulcan Worlds' is a great piece and a smart opener. Lenny White contributed 'Shadow of Lo', which is good, but not spectacular. I was hoping for an Al DiMeola original, but only got 'Earth Juice', which is a group effort.This is probably their low point, yet it is still a good album (note the 4 star review). Every group has its ups and downs. I would suggest this not to be your first RTF album. Start with Romantic Warrior (for the heavier stuff) or Light As A Feather (for the lighter stuff)...."
3,classic funky fusion,"If you're a fan of fusion then this is one of the classics. Funky, jazzy, electronica as delivered by Chick Corea in the earlier stages of his career."
1,This stuff won't dissolve,"I bought this last year so I could just use bleach as a chlorine source. BUT, the granules never dissolve. All the granules end up eventually being swept up by the automatic pool cleaner. I couldn't tell that they did anything. I used test strips that check for stabilizer content and it never did increase my readings. I have even left a pound or so soaking in 5 gal. of water for weeks (stirring occasionally) and still no dissolution. It could be white gravel for all I can tell."
5,Simply and utterly fine,"EWF's 70s' LPs were just outstanding, and this may be the best (aside from I Am -- I'm indifferent on the two personally). Leading off with ""Serpentine Fire,"" the band segues into ""Fantasy,"" which may be the best ever EWF tune. ""Fantasy"" is a musical masterpiece, combining harmonious vocals, funk, and horns into one of the most thoroughly enjoyable refrains of all time. After that, it continues to please -- ""Jupiter"" moves and moves and MOVES, and then evolves into the slower ""Love's Holiday"" and then to the wonderfully brilliant Philip Bailey vocaled ""I'll Write a Song For You."" ""Runnin'"" is easily one of the best instrumental contributions I've ever heard, with outstanding trumpet and saxophone solos."
5,A Musical Masterpiece,"I was only 9 yrs. Old when this album was released and even then I felt it's power! The Album cover alone was awe-inspiring! It was because of that cover, I began a life long fascination with Ancient Egyptian history. Anyway, who understood the meaning of ""Serpentine Fire""? We just knew it was one of the tightest jams we had ever heard! ""Fantasy"" brings back very special memories and my favorite, which should've been a hit, ""Love's Holiday"". This was when EWF was at their zenith! I just wish I could've seen them live during this tour and felt that power first hand.This album is a classic. For someone who is not familiar with EWF, this album is a good place to start!"
5,CD filler,"This was, no doubt, one of EWF's greatest achievements! I agree with Dave Huber that ""I Am"" is probably as fulfilling as ""All N' All"", which is definitely saying something. I think aside from a couple of individual songs here and there, ""Faces"" may have been the last truly exciting release from the greatest band that ever was!"
5,EARTH WIND & FIRE AT THEIR BEST!,"I was a senior at Queens college when the album hit. Anybody who was anybody had this album and played it as much as time and school allowed. It was THE JAM and me and my friends knew the lyrics word by word. Played it and sanged it every chance we got. Talking 'bout something for the people? ""ALL N ALL"" was all that and bags of chips!"
4,Interesting look into the past,"After seeing single versions of the Almanac from the early 30's in an antique store (at about $10 each), I was thrilled to find this book on Amazon. If you like to grow and use herbs (cooking, and with this book, perhaps more uses) and have a curiosity for ""how things used to be"", you'll enjoy this book."
5,Magical Mystery Tour,"A fella from Madrid (I'm above 13 years):I think Sgt. Peppers; Ziggy Stardust, ............and Jazz Samba Encore! are a must have. Luiz Bonfa's solos takes your heart and Getz fills all the amazing space. Smoke something, fix yourself a drink andenjoy the Magical Mystery Tour."
4,"A collection of romantic, relaxing, beautiful music","This CD is a great addition to a Brazilian music collection. I have the three Gilberto compositions on some Gilberto CDs, but it's good to hear some different interpretations. The Bonfa compositions are great. Some of the arrangements and vocals have shades of Esquivel, giving it more of a ""space age"" feel than the Stan Getz-Gilberto collection. This CD is full of romantic, relaxing music, and is perfect for a party."
3,Not as good as the original Jazz Samba,"Sequels rarely satisfy like the original work. It's my guess that the music producers didn't really understand what it was about the original Jazz Samba that made it so special a collection of music pieces. I'm sure the musicians had a lot to do with the choices, but sometimes (because their work by inspiration) you can't make the magic happen again."
5,HALL OF FAME GAME,This is the best video game ever created that is out there. Even if you hate football you will like this. If you own SONY PLAYSTATION and don't own NFL BLITZ go get this game NOW.
5,Wrenching Memoir,"Anchee Min's story is astounding, not because there aren't thousands like it, but because it's written not from the perspective of ""this is what happened when Mao ruled to the people at large"" but from a personal, painful perspective in that Ms. Min chronicles her emotions and actions as though she were telling her diary what happened that day. The potent overtones of living a life of fear are gut-wrenching; I cannot imagine living in a place where nobody is an ally, justice does not exist, and evil men are obeyed to the letter according to their own whims. That people could live lives so ordered by terror and yet accept it to no end boggles my autonomous American mindset. A real-eye opener, so much that I can't seem to write a proper review in coherent sentences. Just, wow."
5,Powerful and Captivating,"This is Anchee Min's best book, in my humble opinion, and it happened to be the first I read of hers. I was drawn in by it almost instantaneously. Since, I have read Becoming Madame Mao, Empress Orchid, The Last Empress, Wild Ginger and now I am reading Pearl of China. Min's stories are intensely relatable and she articulates herself beautifully. I probably won't stop until I've read all of her novels. They are as haunting as they are intriguing."
4,"Good, but can get boring","This story is a good story. It is not a bad story in any way. Anchee portrays her life during Mao's rule in an interesting light. She has explained it from both a personal and political side.The story gets boring from time to time, but it is a good book if you have a day or two to kill."
4,RED,"While I found the syntax a bit off putting in the beginning, the story conveyed a view of the culture and mind set of China which I found engrossing. Enjoyed the read."
1,Not for me,I have read several Chinese women authors dealing with the Cultural Revolution and found Red Azalea by Anchee Min to be most unsatisfying. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs because she would dwell on a particular incident so long that I didn't care about it anymore. I would not recommend this book.
3,Great Story,"I learned so much about communist china in this book and all the others by this author, the things they don't teach you in school are amazing to hear. Even if its a book based on fictional characters. They history is true. I would recommend this book to all my friends and family."
4,shows the inside of a culture quite different,This book is well written and shows someone living in a political and social climate very different than ours; it does a good job showing how the author felt as she starts by believing in the Cultural Revolution and as her experiences progressed grew dissolusioned and bitter. It shows the true emotions and attitudes of someone living through this time period on the inside. I disagree with the reviewer who believes the China of today is much the same; I am visiting China right now and it is much changed.
4,I still think about this book 5yrs later,Lovely book. Well written. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese history.
3,A great memoir destroyed by writing style.,"The story and her experience was very interesting, at times enthralling. However, at times, usually the most critical, her writing style would fall very short of what one wanted.Describing a very intimate, vivid experience in short, basic sentences grew old with me very quickly.I hope maybe her writing, and perhaps her relationship with her editor, has grown over time, as I am going to check out her other books."
3,"Well written, engaging with a disappointing ending.","An engaging and emotional account of a young woman's struggle to escape the confines of the Cultural Revolution. Miss Min draws the reader in to her life in such a way that the reader feels her pain and joys. The book reads well at a consistent pace until the end. Unfortunately, Miss Min ends her story abruptly. There is no transition that takes the reader out of Communist China and to the U.S. The pace of the book changes dramatically in the last several pages, leaving the reader hungry for all that happens in between the death of Mao and Miss Min's arrival in the U.S"
3,Interesting but flawed,"Anchee Min tells the story of her experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Most Americans understand too little about the Chinese political situation, and Ms. Min's story can help us to understand the human side of the story, the suffering and humiliation suffered by so many.Unfortunately, her story doesn't bring much new to the table, except perhaps the lesbian aspect of her sexuality. This aspect remains unexplored, and instead seems almost inserted as an afterthought, for the purposes of titillation rather than real exploration.There are many books about the Cultural Revolution. If one is interested in Ms. Min's story, they would do well to use it as a starting point for reading, rather than as a destination in itself. Too much is left unsaid; the situation leading to the Cultural Revolution was incredibly complex.As light history, Ms. Min's book is interesting, but her writing is often stiff and without the fire that moves the rea! der."
3,Nice memoir,"I read three of Anchee Min's other novels before this - the Empress duology and Becoming Madame Mao. Compared to these, this book is not as good, especially since Min uses a lot of short sentences, so some parts almost feel like 'See Spot Run'. This offers a nice firsthand account of the Cultural Revolution, but does not offer a whole picture - not that Min can be blamed, since she had been confined to Red Fire Farm so much. I do wish she could have provided more detail on her home life - what was it like for her and her family to live in just two rooms after being forced out of their bigger apartment?I wish that Ms. Min could have focused a little more on her family, childhood, and outside events, because compared to 'Empress Orchid', this book comes out as rather dry and lacking when it comes to description. If you're new to Anchee Min, I recommend that you read Empress Orchid before this book. It's a enjoyable read, but not the best memoir."
5,Awesome,If you are a fan of Stan during his Bossa Nova period this is the ultimate must-have for your collection.
4,Nice CDs,"Got these in 2 weeks but without the Firstclass mail in the description. CDs arrived with broken shell but fortunately without any scratch. Really nice Bossa-Nova. Only left me one doubt whether they are brand new as described or not, since I didn't find any plastic membrane in the package."
4,Great Flick,"I loved this movie, have looked locally and could never find it - thanks Amazon for hooking me up! Perfect condition - if you like suspense this one really delivers - Goldie Hawn at her finest (not funniest) shows she can do drama."
1,This DVD has not been released yet,Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received. I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04. Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet.
4,Goldie's Gold,"When I first saw this movie in the theatre, Goldie surprised me with her command of drama. I was blown away. I have been a fan from the Laugh-In days, falling in love with that ditsy blonde that just literally cracked me up! Then came ""Private Benjamin"" and the love affair continued. The critics were not kind with ""Protocol"", but it was a gem again showcasing that incredible comic-timing perfectionism. But when I saw ""Deceived"", the love affair grew into respect for the talent this woman possessed, and I was possessed by the movie, loving the hell out of the twists and turns the movie provided. If you want suspense, intelligent writing and a stellar cast, this is the movie for you. Simplistic in its presentation but punching you in the gut every chance it gets. If you like plots that take you places you were not expecting to go, yup, this is the movie!"
3,Not bad>>>,"I've always liked this movie. The acting is good. There are a few plot holes in this movie[which is why I give it a 3 stars and not a four]. Besides that, this movie holds up."
3,Not Anything Special,"I saw this at Movie Trading Company for $3.99 and on sale for $1.99. So I went on a big limd and bought it. I wasn't that suprised about it, it wasn't that good. Goldie Hawn did a pretty good job. The actor for the husband was a little pradictable. The ending was a suprise, but all in all a pretty good movie."
3,"Good ideas, but written in an unclear manner","I just read this book and found some good ideas I will try and implement this coming school year. However, the authors, for some reason have felt it necessary to rename simple ideas with more complicated, and often hard to recall language. For instance, procedures to reduce problem behaviors are called ""practical reductive techniques"" (basically punishment with a moral lesson) and the ""compliance Matrix Program"" is just bingo for good behavior. In one summary the authors mention the technique of ""maximizing antecedents through precision request"" and I really have no idea what they are talking about...unless I go back and find out that what they are really saying (I think): is stop problems before they happen by being specific about what you want. The title ""The Tough Kid"" is crystal clear; I only wish the rest of the book was as succinct."
5,A wonderful educational book on losing weight forever,"I purchased this book originally in 1980 for my ex- husband. He was an overweight guy (26years of age) Very unhappy with himself because of his weight. He had tried several diets but to no avail. This book changed his life. He regained his confidence, got back his sex appeal and now 19 years later is still going strong. My new partner needs to trim a little so I am repurchasing the book for him. I will go on the diet with him (not because I need to lose weight- but purely for the fun of going on it with him.) The food variety is great.Well worth the investment!!!"
1,This diet is very unrealisitic to follow.,"After reading the Scarsdale Medical diet thoroughly, I don't know how any person that leads the normal fast paced lifestyle which most of us today do, can suceed at this diet. I think the meal plans are very unrealistic and don't know how they could possibly satisfy the average person. I will try the diet, and then maybe I will feel differently, but am not going into this with a real good feeling....I wish I wouldn't have even bothered with the book."
1,Don't buy from Amazon,I ordered a used book and never received it or the replacement that was promised. Now I shop at Borders!
5,Easy to follow and worked well,"If you plan to lose weight, this book may be you answer. At the advice of my Dr, I bought the book. The key to the book is to read the whole book. I was able to lose 44 lbs in 10 weeks. Buy the book. Read the book. Go visit you Dr for his advice."
3,good for QUICK weight loss,"Great book for really fast weight loss. This diet works fast, but you need to keep your cool for the first 3 days until you go into ketosis"
5,Great way to rapid weight loss and still have a lot to eat.,"The diet is palletable, has a wide variety of foods, that change daily, (with the exception of breakfat) . The diet was highly recommended to me and I came back on line after one week and 8 pounds to purchase a copy for my sister. I recommend that you read the book in it's entirety however before beginning. I plan on using this long term.(3 months) as I wish to lose up to 60 pounds. What a Find!!!!"
4,My Go to Program,"My parents have used this program literally my entire life. My mom used this book to loose the baby weight from carrying me. As kids we ate the dinner menus everyday, so much so that I still find myself making BBQ chicken with green beans on Thursdays. I gave this book 4 stars because it is slightly dated. However, I love the program as a whole because if I want to lose a pound a day, I know I can always use ""Scars"" as my family and I lovingly refer to it. Everyone in my immediate family has this book, we love it!"
5,A great diet program to follow for weight loss.,I have used this diet before and lost 15 lbs. in less two weeks
4,The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet,"I used the vegetarian version of this diet in 1981 when I needed to lose around 10 lbs and I did lose a pound a day. In 1987 when I needed to lose weight, I found I did not lose as quickly and resorted to diet pills. I am about to give it one more try with 35 lbs to lose this time, I will post my results.Anyone else have similar problems losing weight with multiple attempts?"
4,Would have loved to see it updated,"Scarsdale is one of the ""classic"" diets. I wish Tarnower were here today to give us his overall feelings about the Atkins and other Protien diets. I find they work as well as Scarsdale. The only difference is, on Scarsdale I was constantly hungry. It's a good read, nonetheless. Especially the mention of Jean Harris in the Acknowledgements."
5,This diet works!,"I ordered this for a friend who had been prescribed the diet to decrease the size of the fatty tumors in her kidneys. Years of poor eating habits had caught up with her. This diet includes foods that seem to interact to slough off the fat quickly. Upon embarking on this diet, she was never hungry and in the first two weeks lost 20 pounds. The next two weeks she went on the maintenance diet and continued to lose weight. She is now on her second two week ""diet"" and the weight still comes off. So... I think this diet works very well. It provides for weight loss and also a maintenance diet for a lifetime of good health. Be careful, though. She is under a doctor's care and you might want to do the same."
2,Terror-able,"Sluggish pacing and some questionable shots make THE TERROR a recommendation only for those who want to see a very young Jack Nicholson and a very old Boris Karloff in something other than the immeasurably superior THE RAVEN. Director Roger Corman lays the atmosphere on with a trowel and leaves continuity, consistency and coherence far behind in his wake.Karloff plays the Baron of a dark and brooding castle and Nicholson plays a misplaced French lieutenant in circa 1805 Somewherevania. There's a long dead wife, a diaphanous maiden prowling about a crypt at night and an old crone with a falcon borrowed from the set of Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. The plot? Well, you can mix those ingredients together and probably come up with something a little more substantial than this one.Not recommended."
2,"Low-budget, snail-paced movie...typical Jack Nicholson stuff","This movie moves at a snail's pace as a soldier takes shelter at an old Baron's castle while searching for a mysterious woman he discovered at the beach near the castle. Boris Karlof's performance as the elderly Baron is the only one that makes this movie worth watching for the first half hour, and even then his acting gets lame and overleveled. Just like other typical Jack Nicholson movies, the movie is very slow, and extremely boring. It is not scary, and it is very easy to see that it is fake and stagy...Rent it, don't buy it."
2,More like The Snore.,"OK, it's Corman so you gotta cut him some slack, but this one couldn't terrify a tourist in Disneyland. Karloff is you're typical SOB--Scary Old Baron; Nicholson's a miscast as a lovestruck Napoleanic officer (French lieutenant? Stick to LA gumshoe, Jake.); and what about that Community Theater witch?! Maybe they should have burned the sets down while filming--a la Gone with the Wind--in order to add some excitement to this one."
3,Too many cooks?,"This movie is a legendary mess - Roger Corman wrapped filming on THE RAVEN early, and not wishing to waste a castle set and the remainder of Boris Karloff's contract, started a gothic movie, then handed this unfinished flick to a series of proteges to complete. Jack Hill, Francis Ford Coppola, and Monte Hellman all took cracks at trying to make sense of an unfinished script. THE TERROR is often referred to as a movie without a plot - there's a plot in there alright, but you've got to be prepared to fight for it. Worth seeing if only for the combination of Karloff and an alarmingly young Jack Nicholson."
3,famously b-nicholson and -coppola,"Unbelievable as it may seem, this awful horror film is actually a cut above the rest. It is mysterious and scary, and has a love interest, excellent actors, and plenty of atmosphere. I did not for a minute guess what was really happening until it was revealed and there were not simple good guys and bad guys, but pretty interesting characters. OK, it is a little hokey, the effects are not great, and it doesn't make a heckuvolotta sense except for the fact that they must have been making it up as they went along.Recommended if you want to see the actors and an early Coppola effort."
3,The Terror,Come on its not that bad!Jack Nicholson is as great as always & Boris Karloff is...well...Boris Karloff.The plot is thin & the production is only fair but even Francis Ford Coppola(asst.director) had to start somewhere!
1,one of the worst movies ever!,"No wonder there are no reviews made. I saw it on tv yesterday. It was terrible. It had a disgustingly simple plot.(One of the things I hate most in a movie or novel)The locale was far from being scary.By the way,I am a Jack Nicholson fan.(He was awesome as ever!)His existence was the only thing that kept me from turning off the tv. Well, worst vice is advice but please take it. Do not even bother to check out the details on the net.PS.This is the first film that I've seen directed by Roger Corman. I will buy his book on making movies in Hollywood and never losing a dime.If his other movies are directed in the same manner that won't be a surprise for me.(But you never know! )"
4,Master Movies offers best quality DVD of The Terror,"WARNING: If you are looking for a DVD of the Terror, there are some awful copies available! The disc from Master Movies is by FAR the best available. There are no extras to speak of except for some biographical info (some incorrect) but the film looks surprisingly good, especially if you boost the black level on your player. AVOID THE OTHER VERSIONS. The Master Movies version is the one with the non-descript grey cover with a small picture of Nicholson. No extras, blah cover, excellent picture for a public domain film."
3,"Boris and Roger, you gotta love 'em.","For some reason, I like this film. It had atmosphere, a deserted castle, lightening and thunder, and Boris Karloff. The price of the ""Master Movie"" edition for this DVD is unbeatable, but then you're not getting wide screen, which is a let down. But as far as I know, there are, at this time, no wide screen editions of ""The Terror"" on DVD or VHS. However, the picture quality is great, and sound quality is acceptable. I'm really disappointed, though, not to see more of the Poe classic Corman films on DVD, yet, in wide screen, of course. A better buy, though a little more expensive, is ""Tales of Terror"". Excellent color, wide screen, beautiful sound, and of course, Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone, and Peter Lorre."
3,"Yes, We're French--Can't You Tell?","2 1/2 stars for movie, 3 1/2 stars for cult appeal: I know many people consider this Roger Corman film a minor classic, but for my taste--it's a bit too earnest for its own good. I've watched it about five times in my life, I'm not sure why, and it always strikes me as an interesting curiosity without arousing much passion. Notable mostly for a lead performance by a young (and relatively expressionless) Jack Nicholson as well as an elderly Boris Karloff, the film plays as a otherworldly love story. Nicholson is enchanted by a mysterious woman and his pursuit of her leads him to an isolated castle and a secret long past. It's methodically paced and not particularly surprising--but there are simple pleasures to be had to see Nicholson stomp around in a fit of entitlement. Pretty straightforward and dignified considering some of the other movies Corman has put his stamp on--perhaps that's why it sticks out for some. KGHarris, 8/11."
4,"""Begin"" is masterful, a 3 CD set is a bit of overkill though","Sundazed should issue ""Begin"" separately...it is a superb LP for those into late 60s AM pop music. The first two CDs have some excellent cuts, but the set approaches overkill for casual fans of Boettcher's work what with all the instrumental tracks and such. It's a shame that the early 1990s reissue of ""Begin"" is out of print."
5,Using Gravity for Flight,"This fascinating book is packed with exciting text and brilliant color photos. You will discover the Army Parachute Team: The Golden Knights, what they do and how they do it. This book provides a history of the Team and of parachuting, describes their mission and maneuvers and then looks to the future.

1,Blah.,"This is not what I wanted to spend my cash on. Dont get me wrong, Screaming Lord Sutch is great but these are not the original recordings I am interested in. These songs were probably re-recorded in the 80's giving the songs a real slickly produced make over. Cd's like these never make the buyer aware that these are not the original recordings. This is the second time i've been duped in less than a month. Get another Sutch album. Now I have to stab my roomate with somthing rusty. Oooh i'm hot and bothered."
5,Great Film,"This is a great sleeper. Just happened to see it by chance. Wasn't really promoted (at least, not that I saw). It's well written, directed and edited, with some great scenes. If you enjoy understated comedy, you'll probably like this. Very funny, touching movie."
4,Perfect!,"This disc is perfect! I mainly bought it for the game robotron but the graphics are superb. I bought a similar disc and it just wasn't the same, close but not as close as this one! Now I don't have to waste quarters on that game Defender (I used to hate that game). Sure it's different than using the joystick and fire button but what do you expect!?"
4,very entertaining,"I just met Mrs. Byrne's dictionary at the home of a linguist. A houseful of brilliant linguists, and almost none had heard of any of the words. But they laughed and enjoyed them tremendously. Now I'm ordering a copy.Though the author's intro says that all the words have been found in at least one reputable dictionary, some of these appear to be nonce words (no more established in use than a sniglet), while others are merely obscure. But both kinds are entertaining!"
5,Great plants,The order is exactly what I was expecting. The order arrived very quickly. They are the perfect size for my 6 gallon tank.
4,Great story telling,"Being Swiss and remembering the day when the story happened and was broadcasted in all newspaper, this movie captures all what I felt at that time. It tells the story with care and insight, and does not try to be too emotional. This movie was brilliant in story telling (of a TRUE story)."
1,I hated this movie,"In a nutshell, the actors were good, the filming was good, but the story was not much different than what happens everyday with Mexicans crossing into ht US illegally. What I hated about this movie was the part about the mother and father abandoning their small children to seek a better life in Switzerland. And I HATED the ending. The only redeeming character was the Swiss nurse. For entertainment, I prefer the Sound of Music. At least it has a happy ending."
4,good,"I enjoyed Miss Starner's music but i have heard her compared to Tori Amos quite often. I can make only three comparisons Miss Starner sings with the same strength in thoughts, she sits at her piano like Tori and she may play it with the same fervor. I love Tori Amos, and i just don't think that Miss Starner can really be called the same as her. Though I will say that Miss Starner has good taste in music being a TORI fan herself, and even borrowing a line from GIRL my all time favorite song. SHE DOES HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL. I do however think she sounds more like Ani Difranco, and Jewel, and even Kristen Hersh."
2,"Nice, Good, Talented-- Nothing Special","Shelby Starner sound like a bit of an egotistical 15 year old. I, being a 14 year old singer-songwriter myself know that all her lyrics can't come from real life (and thats ok,) but rhyming ""Don't try to hold my hand, don't try to understand"" leaves me stone cold. Don't get too full of yourself, Shelby. It was just luck."
3,"They, of course, overrate it, but it deserves a listen.","This is an electronic alternative album that is caught quite uncommercially-favorably between industrial and pop-rock. It's been described as a brighter NIN and a darker, harder Arkarna. I don't think it has the (sometimes obnoxious) bite of JunkieXL, but that can be a good thing. Mostly, though, is a condemnation in that nothing particularly stands out or sounds radically different from anything else. Repeated listens would surely produce favorites, but to ""earn"" a listen a catering, inane single must break into commercial radio, which obviously didn't happen...a small shame. This is a pretty safe bet."
1,Leave your brain and taste at the door,"""Danger Kitty"" has mass produced some of the worst music in the history of Pop. To all of the BJ fans out there, look up the word, ""cliche"". Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes. It's ahem !! like a ""wet, slippery, loaded gun"". If you're going to write lyrics this horrible, juvenile and unimaginative, why bother finishing Junior High at all. Drop out of school, get yourself a job at Hot Dog on a Stick and say goodbye to every one of your brain cells. Patriotism demands that you rid your CD player of anything that makes you look like you couldn't finish the 4th grade. Do it for your country!"
1,So incredibly overrated..,"Bon Jovi are in close competition with Nirvana for the ""Most Overrated Band in History"" award. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the cr@ppy ""Living on a Prayer"" played on the radio, I'd be able to retire in comfort, and I'm only 21! I can only reccommend this album to people who like to annoy themselves with $hitty music."
1,Shallow music for shallow people,Who actually likes Bon-Jovi anyway? Mullett wearing rednecks and Heretics.
1,0 stars,"I agree with Motorbreth 100%. This is the absolute bottom of the barrel. This is the album and the band that made heavy metal/hard rock about hair instead of music. The WORST band of ALL TIME.COMPLETE and UTTER GARBAGE.There isn't one second of music here that dislays the slightest bit of talent or musicianship. Jon Bon Jovi is the WORST singer in modern music. Period. Steve Perry and Journey are more credible (...ugh. I can't believe I just wrote that! - DAMN YOU, Bon Jovi!)A complete waste of time and money....."
3,State of pop metal in 1986!,"I remember back in 1986 this was the album to own!! Everyone of my friends had it and so did I. We were all young once!! The music today is dated to say the least, but still fun. When I hear songs like ""You give love a bad name"" or ""Living on a prayer"" I remember the good times!! Worth having for memories alone."
4,"By Far Bon Jovi's Best Effort and with Remastered Sound, Never Sounded Better!","A very good rock album that appeals to the ladies as well; from complaining in the past that their cds of their prior albums sounded worse than the cassettes of other artists, they can have no complaints here as the remastered versions sound very good indeed. Recommended!"
5,An 80's Classic!,"I just got into 80's music not long ago because I wasn't old enough to appriciate the decade back then. I bought this album about three years ago, and now it doesn't come out of my CD player. The lyrics might be a little cheeky, but this album is all about being young and free and appriciating the best days of our lives. As a fifteen year old I can relate to this music better than any of the popular music today. It's not just the lyrics that make this album great either. Richie Sambora's guitar wails and illustrates the hair metal style of the 80's. The melodies are extremely infectious and every song has a lick in it that will rock you. It's no Blonde on Blonde or Sgt. Pepper's, but this album is truely memorable. My favorites: 1) Never Say Goodbye 2) I'd Die For You 3) Without Love 4) Livin' On A Prayer 5) Wanted Dead Or Alive."
5,Awsome CD,This is one of Bon Jovi's best CDs and I would recomend it to any fans of rock! It has an edge to it but it isnt hard rock. There are some catchy songs on here that would be great for parties or jamming on long road trips!! A must have!
2,Ehhh not that good at all,"Slippery When Wet some think its the greatest album of all time but personally i think its just one of those albums you can just pass on as nothing. Whats so special about, ""Let It Rock"", oooh so they used synth and guitar and just played one note and than bon jovi's singing comes in who cares. The reason i give it two stars is because its okay i guess i mean livin on a prayer and wanted dead or alive is okay but besides that its too glammy. not great not good"
3,BUBBLEGUM AT ITS BEST,"IF you like bubblegum rock, totally cold and formulatic and full of cliches, this is the best that you can get. If you don't like this kind of sound, stay asidew from ""SLIPPERY WHEN WET"". From the sleeve inside you know what kind of cheesy lyrics and stupid rock you'll get. But Bon Jovi does it sound at least with quality."
1,Not That Good,"this isn't the worst album ever, but it's not good. Now, i'm a huge fan of the 80's rock scene, but for some reason, i never caught on to this album. Livin' on a prayer, for god's sake, i'd rather listen to an old guy crap his pants. The only worhtwile song on here, in my opinion, is ""I'd Die For You."" Now that's a good song.If you're into bon jovi, GET IT, BY ALL MEANS!! but if you have a taste in music, buy van halen's 1984, or Def Leppard's High 'N' Dry instead. GREAT 80's ROCK!!"
1,Bon Jovi = bad joke,"I used to think Korn was the destroyer of metal, boy was I wrong...after hearing this I knew it was Bon Jovi. I really think that this is the worst music of the 80's, even worse than Modanna or Paula Abdul. Even hairmetal fans dont like this! Hairmetal fans listen to Twisted Sister and Skid Row, and avoid pop like this, White Snake, Poison, Warrant, and Europe. This bad joke here made it so other pansies like Cinderella had a chance to make it, when all they were were talentless hacks who ripped off Van Halens 1984. I couldn't imagine anyone listening to this without having their ears bleed, this makes disco look like Led Zeppelin! Well, at least its better than Good Charlotte and Linkin Park (although not by much).Anyone who hates Jon Bon Blowme and Bad Joke is commendable, because they (Socialist Metal Head, Cotton Hell for example) are smart enough to realize how p**sified this is. I feel bad for anyone who doesn't see through Bad Jokes haze.DIE JON BON BLOWME!"
1,Candy Coated Pussified 100 % Certified Garbage,Here it is - Slippery When Wet . I believe Bon Jovis 3rd album .This album is a turning point if you follow heavy metal . Its the watershed album that turned heavy metal from an up and comming genre into a laughing stock . This band doesnt get the flack it deserves . This is the 1910 Fruitgum Company with flangers and fuzzboxes. Its candy a$$ crap aimed at 13 year old girls. Its part of the reason music is in the sad state it finds itself today. This is what Nirvana( the most over rated bandin history )and a host of grunge bands revolted against ... and successfully so. Why ? Because this music is so bad that anything would make it look good. You can directly thank Bon Jovi and crue for the pussification of heavy metal.
3,"Playing a 12-string, singing about a 6-string. Pooptastic.","""You Give Love a Bad Name"" is ostensibly the anthemic tale of a succubus in angels' garb taking advantage of a mullet clad bohunk. ""Livin' on a Prayer"" instantly seduces with its opening riff. (What instrument is that?!) Presumably our two main characters' narrative continues here in an unlikely New Jersey love story. In ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" Mr. Bon Jovi ditches the star crossed lovers for a classic Western motif. I dare you to find a more infectious 12-string riff. That he references a 6-string in the song only adds to the mystery. The rest of this album is garbage, but these three tunes keep it floating above the poop."
5,"I bought it at age 13, enjoy it still today.",I'm 27. I love the 80's hair metal scene. I like this CD a lot. My favorites are:1) Wanted Dead or Alive (best song they ever did) 2) Livin' on a Prayer (excellent) 3) Never Say Goodbye (very good) 4) I'd Die For You (cool) 5) You Give Love A Bad Name (kicks serious booty)Please pick up this CD. E-mail me at: hairmetal80@mail.com
2,Vo5 charged hair metal,"Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like ""Let it Rock"", ""You give love a bad name"" and ""Livin on a Prayer"". ""Wanted:Dead or Alive"" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic. IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car."
3,Hmmmmmmm!,Actually 2.5 stars. Slippery When Wet by Bon Jovi is an average album. It is cleverly produced and written and their looks probably had some big part to due with their sucess. However this is album is very dated and is indeed pop rock. I can hardly call this a hard rock album because this is pop rock. The lyrics are often dull and childish and really this album won't sound fresh to the ears nor unique. I don't hate Bon Jovi I'm not just feeling them. This album is not my cup of tea.
2,Not impressive,"Bon Jovi mixes rock and pop on this album to make something that has a complete 80s sound. This album, especially the hit livin on a prayer, is a complete Bruce Springsteen ripoff. After seeing how well Springsteen had been doing (in particular 2 years earlier with Born In The USA) this band tried to use the same themes in their music but it didn't work so well for them. Buy Springsteen way before this."
4,A masterpiece of 80's Rock,"Take yourself back to the days when your hair was long and Rock was cool as only Bon Jovi know how (Stay away from his Pathetic solo albums though!)Slippery When Wet transformed Bon Jovi from minor-league wannabe rockers to global superstars like Def Leppard and G'N'R. On the back of hit singles ""You Give Love a Bad Name,"" ""Never Say Goodbye,"" and, of course, ""Living on a Prayer"" this album goes from strength to strength. From the scantily clad car-wash girls on the inner sleeve to the ""You lost more than that in my back seat,"" lyrics, the album is blissfully untouched by irony and subtlety, which actually adds to its charm. Slippery When Wet won't change your world, but it will, undoubtedly, rock it"
3,Mountains of money kept me afloat,"I own a small record shop, and this album saved my hide last year when it came out. The newer, spiffier Musicland opened just across the street some 18 months ago, and, as you might imagine, its broad selection and lower prices nearly put me out of business. With a wife and three kids to support, this was not a promising time in my life.Enter Bon Jovi's ""Slippery When Wet.""As stated, this album singlehandedly saved my shop from going bankrupt. In point of fact, I could barely keep it in stock. And while I myself don't much care for this loud style of music, I've got to admit that this Jon Bon Jovi guy is on to something. Thanks for saving my hide, Mr. Jovi.The new Def Leppard comes out later this year. Be interesting to see how it does."
2,Highly Overrated!,"When I first wrote a review for this album I was a little ""hard"" on Bon Joi and this disc. After reading my review several times I realized this wasn't a ""bad"" album, it's just that it sold a lot more copies than I thought it would. I just don't understand why Bon Jovi has remaind so popular while other bands like Dokken and Ratt have not enjoyed that level of success. Was Bon Jovi that much different than Ratt or Dokken? Of course not! Those three bands first appeared during the '80s and pretty much recorded the same kind of music (hard rock). Although this album does contain some of Bon Jovi's best tunes (Wanted Dead or Alive and You Give Love a Bad Name) those songs are really no better than Dokken's In My Dreams or Ratt's Round and Round. Ratt and Dokken may have rocked a little ""harder"" than Bon Jovi, but if you compare this album to Ratt's Out Of The Cellar or Dokken's Under Lock And Key I feel the Ratt and Dokken albums are much stronger and contain better songs."
3,Simple Review,"Highlights: #2 You Give Love a Bad Name, #3 Livin' on a Prayer, #7 Without Love, #9 Never Say Goodbye. Lowlights: #1 Let It Rock, #4 Social Disease. Good album."
1,The most pathetic waste of time I have ever seen,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Usually, a truly abhorrent film offers at least some opportunity for entertainment, by either laughing at its stupidity or poking fun at it Mystery Science Theater style. Not A Knight's Tale. There isn't anything resembling plot continuity. The anachronisms are incredibly awful...you cannot suspend disbelief enough to actually accept these things happening. What's worse is the fact that the attempts at humor fall flat as well. The only redeeming qualituy this film has is an attractive cast, but eye candy isn't nearly enough to save it.Don't waste your time. I know I wish I hadn't."
2,Gack!,The music in this one really puts you off the mood. Jousting and rock-n-roll just don't feel right together.
2,Pulleeezze tell me,"That it was Heath Ledger's twin brother Heath BAR in this movie.I hated the ""new found"" rock music they played to try to upscale the movie. I probably would have liked this so much better if they'd stuck with more...periodic music.By far the most amusing and most fun was Heath's would-be harald most of the time naked companion.Overall I wish this had been a much better movie."
1,Fairly Poor Show,"Now I can forgive all the historical inaccuracies in this movie (and there were many) but what I cannot forgive is the vacuous plot that frankly came across as if having been written on the back of a Starbucks napkin minutes before shooting on day one.Ledger seems a decent actor but here he was trying to hold this abomination together almost single-handed and failed miserably. As I mentioned, the plot was so obvious, I felt like maybe they producers had stumbled across one of my 4th grade essays and cribbed the movie from that. The acting, bar Ledger, was pretty ropey and the whole hi-hi-hilariousness of the movie failed miserably.A pleasant watch for teens and impressionable young women I'm sure."
1,It fails on so many levels!,"P.U.!!!OK, the obvious thing is the horrible idea of using rock music as a soundtrack for a period movie. It is such a ridiculous and horrible idea that it's hard to imagine anybody actually going along with it. Did the direcor have nobody to discuss these things with? But the rest of the film is actually so bad that the crappy choice of music doesn't really stand out the way you'd expect it to.I'm granting the single star here for Rufus Sewel who was put to much better use in Dark City. This movie might do to the cinematic knight what Don Quixote did to all those literary tales of knight errantry, i.e. kill it dead as a stone.If you see this movie in your local rental outlet, turn around and walk away quickly. It really is that bad."
3,"Wonderful cast, interesting story. Distracting soundtrack.","It's too bad such an interesting, well acted story was waylaid by the constant barrage of anachronistic music, costume design and dialog. There were so many good things to recommend this movie, but every time they would break into a rock song or the lead love interest would show up with magenta streaked hair, the net effect was jarring. I'm glad we rented rather than bought this one!"
5,This movie is great!,I really thought that this movie was so much fun. That's all I have to say! I'll be sure to buy it here when it comes out.
5,An excellent adventure,"It's a rare thing when I actually want to see a movie that's released into theatres. I find that all too often movies are full of violence, swearing, and sex. I was very much relieved when I heard about this release coming out--and I was not in the least disappointed. In fact, it was better than I imagined! The story is funny, exciting and inspiring. It's message is to reach for your dreams and to not let circumstances stop you. As for the cast, they were all great in their roles. Particularly noteworthy, however, are not its stars but rather the actor who turned in a fine performance as a young Geoffrey Chaucer (another reason why I wanted to see this film--it was supposedly what gave Chaucer the idea for his ""Canterbury Tales""). All in all, it is a great film for the entire family. I wish it the best of luck at the summer box office."
5,Wow!,This movie was so funny and great! I'm going to go see it again for my 4th time. It gets better each time!
4,"Exciting and Enjoyable ""Knights in Armour"" Romance","It had to happen eventually - Hollywood updating mediaeval European Chivalry complete with Jousting, Heraldry and Fair Maidens. But fear not, dear reader, for this is a finely crafted and handsomely presented tale!Never taking itself too seriously ""A Knight's Tale"" manages to pull off a presentation which is lighthearted, exciting and also amusing. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Geoffrey Chaucer, roving poet and wit, who finds himself employed as Herald to our hero Knight with amusing effect. The film moves along at a fair pace and keeps the level of action and interest high as well as bringing in a frisson of romance. Top marks to the Director and Cast for having created exactly what they set out to do.In short this is a film which is very enjoyable though one which will not set the earth alight with originality. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it for an enjoyable night in."
3,Harmless fun!,"A Knight's Tale is a fun good natured medievil film with rock music ? When I first saw people in the stands stomping their feet and singing ""We wil Rock You!"", I was like ""what the hell?"" but then I realized that I was actually enjoying that. It's not every medievil film where a knight is treated more like a jock and at parties dance to David Bowie, lol. It's pretty clever and original actually even if it may seem corny to some. Plus Heath Ledger proves that he's more than ready to be a leading man. Rufas Sewell (Dark City) is excellent as Ledger's rival. Mark Addy (The Full Monty) is good as his loyal friend as well. A Knight's Tale isn't a great film but it is an entertaining one that just might put a smile on your face if you don't take it too serious that is."
3,It's called a lance... hello,"This movie had alot going for it, but it really fell short in the end. The ending with him jousting without armour and strapping the lance to his arm is just silly. The movie is modern in every sense of the word and that is it's greatest failing. As much as I like the music on it's own it fails to inspire in a story about jousting. There is an MTV mentality that prevails throughout the film. It is a big disappointment. It's strongest element is the characters as most are likeable and interesting. It tries hard to be fun and fantasy, but it's modern influences are so heavy and overdone that it is difficult to appreciate the rest. It is no Excalibure or Ivanhoe."
3,Light entertainment,This Heath Ledger film isn't supposed to be an historic epic. Rather a light spoof of the historic movie. Entertaining and I always like to watch the late Ledger.
4,Knight's Tale extended cut,"The extended scenes were interesting, but ultimately added nothing to the film. I enjoyed the edited version just as much."
4,Great Movie to have,"Great Picture and great story, Great discounted pirce (Bought it BOGO deal) Great movie to add into your Blu-ray collections."
5,Very entertaining,"I love this movie. Good story, funny when needed and serious when appropriate. The acting is very good and the location is beautiful."
3,1500s,"This is the story of a jousting knight at the end of the Middle Ages and begining of the Renaissance. As if the Middle Ages were so cool. Plus a pulse pounding metal score make it worth seeing for knights in armor devotees. It's not bad, i kindas liked it."
2,I'm Different: I Didn't Like It,"I notice the other Amazon reviews are high on this film. I wish I could say my opinion were as high of it. I found it flat throughout and I can't say that Heath Ledger, who I'd heard was the next big leading man in the movies, did anything for me either. The rock music set to the medieval setting was good and the Chaucer character was a very good one and interesting to watch (a supporting role). Rufus Sewell also made an interesting villain. However, those are the only virtues I could find in this action adventure yarn set in the medieval jousting world. If you are looking for a knockout script and knockout acting, look elsewhere."
4,Enjoyable Movie,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Moves fast, good characters, sense of humor, and good music."
4,A very enjoyable movie,"I have to be honest. When I first saw the preview for this movie, I thought teenagers in the Middle Ages, and thought I would hate it. How wrong I was. To take a line from the movie, its all about rising above your simple beginnings and ""changing your stars."" The soundtrack, a wonderful mix of rock and classic, really hightens the viewing pleasure, and the jousting scenes are just fantastic. You will not be disappointed."
4,Down and Dirty Jousting,"Heath Ledger plays a servant of a Knight that Jousts competitively, but when the Knight dies of natural causes, Heath decides to take his place in the tournament. From here, Heath goes on to compete in many other tournaments fraudulently under the name of his now dead Lord, and does well.There is a cast of many great characters including William Chaucer, and the result is a well rounded action movie with rags to riches Cinderella-like twist. That's not to say that this is girly film, it's actualy quite gritty and dirty.Overall it is a quite enjoyable film that I highly reccomend!"
1,An embarrassing fiasco,"I watched this terrible movie on the recommendation of a friend, recently. As soon as I heard the music of Queen, I knew that I was about to be subjected to a slice of dumbed down unfunny Pop culture schlock.I wouldn't be surprised if Aussie thesp, Heath Ledger, prudently leaves this dud off his resumé. I wouldn't blame him, either! However, he did make ""Two Hands"" and on the strength of that film alone, he deserves our respect."
1,"Gen-X, MTV Fair","This movie is awful. Implausible does not bother me. A few anachronisms can even be appreciated. But this movie goes beyond the pale with music from 1970's rock bands and the characters clapping in time.Maybe it got better. I walked out after the first 15 agonizing minutes. Fortunately the theater let my wife I swap tickets to see the ""The Mummy Returns.""If you like the Hercules TV series, you might like this movie. But wait until it goes to video."
1,A Shallow Tale,"An idiotic film about the Middle Ages set at the pace of modern music, fashion, and values. The fashion and mannerisms are as far off from reflecting the period as the music; why bother making a movie about that time then? For this genre, I prefer silly films such as 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' which never pretend to be anything else than absurd. This is a film more suited for those of infantile dispositions rather than children proper."
5,What a Knight,"loved this movie. If you are a person who loves the times of the knights and Heath Ledger, this movie is for youA Knight's Tale: The Shooting Script (Newmarket Shooting Script Series)"
5,A Knight's Tale - -- FANTASTIC!!!!,"One of the best movies I have ever seen!! My daughter and I went to see it for my birthday and we had to go back and see it again for her birthday!! I love the music, the humor, the romance, the action, the cast --- it's got it all and then some!! I rarely buy movies but this is one I am definitely going to buy so I can watch it again and again!!"
3,A fun way to spend a rainy afternoon,"I really enjoyed this movie. Sure it was a little predictable and cliched but overall I found it entertaining. The anachronistic music and costume design gave a new, interesting look and sound to a story that has been told before. For every flaw there is an equally creative, original element to balance it. Am I the only woman over the age of 15 who thinks Heath Ledger is a cutie?"
5,Good Drama!,I was really debating rather or not to buy this movie cause I thought it be corny. I did buy it and watched it 4 times already. It a great movie! Lots of ups and downs. Having you cheer for the underdog and screaming at the Tv. I really liked this movie!
3,A lame but Rock and Roll fairy tale,"""A Knight's Tale"" is a silly little movie that has a rock and roll heart and soundtrack. It's a bit offbeat in that sense. Hearing ""We will Rock you"" in a knight movie seemed a bit strange to me at first, but I just decided to try and enjoy this movie for what it was...a somewhat laid back attempt at a fairy tale romance involving a jousting knight and the beautiful girl he falls for. It had a few laughs and the actors were all fine. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun movie that happens to have Heath ledger as it's main character. He is certainly as good an actor as he is good looking. FOR YOU DIE HARD HEATH FANS: this is a must see!!he is perfectly charming as ""William"", who wants to be a Knight, fight the bad guy, and win the girl.It was a little predictable, but cute.Worth a rental fee."
3,Not Exactly What I Hoped For...,"I saw this movie expecting to really love it. I liked the soundtrack, but I didn't think it really went with the movie. To me, it made the movie kinda cheezy and like a movie spoof. There was great acting, good story (predictable, but still good), and I wasn't really happy with the girl he won in the end. I'm glad I watched it, just to see it, but I would never watch it again."
3,SILLY FUN,"Heath Ledger confirms his star potential in this fluffy, midbrow-concept fable, which is utterly predictable. His performance is one of the more compelling elements in this corny story, set in a nameless medieval jousting era. The fun concept of using 70s rock tunes such as WE WILL ROCK YOU and TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS is never exploited fully, and so falls flat, with the single exception of a delightful dance sequence set to David Bowie's GOLDEN YEARS -- for a few moments, the movie musical comes back to life. One wishes the movie went full-tilt into the anachronistic fun of music and story/setting -- it might have been a camp classic while rousing pre-fab emotion. As it is, A KNIGHT'S TALE has its limited appeal, but is only half-baked."
1,"Great movie, terrible blu-ray edition","This is a great movie full of fun, humor and a little romance! The Blu-ray edition has NONE of the special features from the regular DVD releases. Not only is this NOT the extended cut, it doesn't even offer the deleted scenes on a special features menu. In fact there is NO special features menu. I've noticed this issue on a lot of Blu-ray releases. Sure you get the better looking film but no interviews, no commentary, no deleted scenes. Nothing. I am so disappointed in this release. I will be getting rid of it and going back to my regular DVD and researching the Blu-rays before purchasing. They are absolutely NOT worth it if you don't get any special features. How sad! Boo on the studio that did this."
2,Had potential,"Ok maybe it is just me, but this film had the potential to be great. Especially with the budget it was given. Classic rock had no business being in a film like this. Especially in the beginning with the spectators singing along. Plus there sounded as if there was a jukebox in the French pub. Not to mention some of the Gen X fashions and hair styles that were worn. You make your own judgment but was very unbelievable for the period they were portraying."
2,Oh dear...,"Absolute ... the director seems to have been trying for a blend of medieval and modern culture which worked VERY badly. Also, bad plot, unlikable heroine.One star earned by the fact the Heath Ledger was quite astonishingly good looking in armour and growled at people a lot. A further star earned by Chaucer, who was really quite amusing.However, neither of these things will convince me to buy it."
3,a good jousting movie,"there's a lot of great jousting scenes in this one, a great cast and a very funny part by Alan Tudyk(28 Days, TV's Firefly) who is just great. though it lacks with its music choices and the signing and dancing really hurt my corneas. otherwise its enjoyable for its time."
4,Modern Knights,"A great movie - and lots of fun. The people who put the soundtrack together did an incredible job at bringing the romance of knights in shining armour into the modern age. It may not be necessarily believable, but who cares? My whole family really enjoyed it, and I recommend the Soundtrack CD as well."
4,"Not the best, but certainly not the worst","I really question the judgement of some of these reviewers. A work of Satan..??! Oh, please! First, I am an English teacher, and a big fan of Chaucer and his times. The first time I saw this movie, I was screaming in disbelieving horror throughout. However, my sons loved it and it was on HBO, so the second time they watched it, I could see some merit. By the third time, I was forced to agree with the reviewer who said Chaucer would've loved this. He would have. The commoner rising up on his own (basically) honest merits comes straight from Chaucer. Yes, some of the dialogue is cliched, the Black Prince was not noted for progressiveness, but the cast makes it rise up above such picayune things. Ledger is great, and Jocelyn actually has a mind of her own. See it with an open mind and see for yourself. One other note - mute the volume during Robbie Williams attempt at Queen (final song). Now THAT is desecration!!"
1,Disappointing,I had expected this to measure up to Terry Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm - but - was sadly disappointed. Cartoonish and immature.
4,Hilarious,"Anyone's imagination can run wild, so why not screw up the jousting world? Queen is one of my favorite bands, and if you think about it really hard "" We Will Rock You"" makes complete sense at a match.For all you history freaks (including me ), stop all the hard-core facts and bring your nose out of the texbooks. "" A Knight's Tale"" still sticks to the real thing with the terrific exception of funny modern twists. Come on , who doesn't want to laugh at something as silly as this ? It would be a miracle if someone didn't laugh at all the whole movie. Say it's utterly ridiculous and that's the honest truth, but it's still a great film."
4,Not bad.,"This was a fairly good film, but honestly - if you like it - you will love it. You don't like it - it will be one of the films you despise for this year.It was a very risky film, and most people I have spoken to, tell me they were a little disappointed. Me - I thought it was okay. Worthy of 4 stars at least for the cool action sequences and the co-ordinating of that opening sequence"
5,I LOVED THIS MOVIE,"I loved it beyond all comparison. I'm a large movie person, and I know my stuff. This movie was a mixture of hard action, romance, hot men, and a great soundtrack! I think everyone should see this movie, and forget what the critics say. You know what you like. And I think you'll definitly love this movie."
4,Good.,"I would say this movie is more of the old swashbuckler type. It's got lots of great heavy hitting action. but I would say it has a little too much of it. It almost seems like it's on repeat sometimes. But the action is great and if you want to watch a whole lot of it. I would say go for it! I really did enjoy the movie! It had a generally good story line. A little predictable, but well covered. At times I think the characters were hard to believe in, and the modern intrusions (Like some of the costumes and a lot of the music) could be annoying to some people. But I think most everybody should like this, and probably most people will really like it!"
5,fav,Ordered this for myself and just love Heath Ledger in this wonderful movie with excellent music and great story plot.
3,"THIS MOVIE JUST DIDN'T ""CUT"" IT FOR ME","I got this movie because HEATH LEDGER was in it. I like him, But I didn't really like this movie. All the actors were good. The sound tract was good (rock&roll;). The story line, for me, was lacking. Mostly. I felt it was a movie for teenage girls.I will recommend an early HEATH LEDGER movie I really like. TWO HANDS. It's Australian, as is Heath. The story is GREAT, INVENTIVE, FUNNY and all the actors are great. Even though TWO HAND is HUMOROUS, it's not really a comedy. It's a gangster movie. I love Australian cinema and TWO HANDS is very representative of that genre."
5,Very Good,This movie brings the thrill of knights and jousting to life with a great Rock beat.Heath Ledger is great as the hero. This movie is very entertaining .
4,This is why I like to watch movies.,OK the bottom line is that this is a very very watchable movie. Enjoy every minute.
4,"old story, new music","I love this movie with its story of the poor boy making it to the top despite all the odds of a lowly birth. There is a message to teenagers about how anyone can achieve a goal as long as (s)he has the desire and the right skills.The music didn't fit Chaucer's time, of course, but it did carefully fit the plot. In fact, I bought the movie soundtrack right after I bought the movie. Both are excellent additions to my music and movie collections.I am glad to own both movie and its music."
5,Just plain funny...,"I never watch movies more than once, but thanks to my teen daughter this movie has been played in my home about five times since I saw it in the theater. I never ""find something else to do"". I watch it straight through every time, and it gets better with age! I find the silliness, funny references, rock soundtrack quirky and wonderful, and yet the romantic story remains compelling. Now I watch it just for the sheer fun of it."
4,Fun mix of Josting realism and Rock N Roll,"Good script, interesting characters, plenty of fun moments mixed with 1970s rock n roll make this a family favorite. It is family friendly and has the two things that make a movie great for my 7 year son.. swords. sword-fighting. Throw in a good love story and a dreamy star, according to my daughters when describing Heath ledger and this is an above average movie worthy of 4 stars - very good.The story is about a commoner who pretends to be a nobleman. he gathers a ""pit crew"" of sorts and enters the josting circuit. I immediately makes a friend of an important person, but an enemy of another, creating the main tension in the story.If you haven't seen this one yet, go rent it tonight."
1,Garbage!,"What a waste of time, a total load of garbage. By this tale David Bowie is about 1000 years old. I would have better spent my time watching paint dry!"
2,Cliched,Lacked the ability to keep my interest. Story was all to common. I could not even relate to the two leading characters.
1,Work of Satan,"This is a zero star film.A real abomination... why was it made? How can anyone actually like it?The humanity...And besides, such low born scum could never aspire to the lofty goal of knighthood... ha!Take your wet dreams elsewhere..."
1,Typical,"Let me just start off with saying that the editorial review for this movie was. . . unhelpful. So the movie has rock music in it. Who cares?With that aside, this movie is basically a compilation of things I've seen in other movies many times before. For example--the ""common peasant"" making his way to greatness-storyline, the teach me how to dance because I don't know how to dance-scene, the two opposing characters with a love interest in the same girl, and of course the bad guy getting beaten in the end while the good guy steals the girl. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bad guy wears black armor and rides a black horse. This is orginality at its best."
1,Worst movie ever.,"I consider myself to be a pretty open movie watcher. I enjoy watching period style movies. I even thought the movie Black Night was pretty entertaining. This movie was just a bad movie. Not even bad in a funny way. If you make a movie about people in the Renaissance period, you don't have crowds singing ""we will rock you"", and doing ghetto dances. The story, in itself, is hard to digest on it's own... and has been done before... many times over... and better. It's your standard happy-feely random kid goes from rags to riches doing what he loves to do with the help of a couple other down-and-out characters who end up being miracle workers with ingenuity. There is absolutely no historical truth in this movie, and apparently no research done at all to even make it seem somewhat believable.Bottom line is, save your money. This movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it."
1,Absolutely hated it!,"This is by far the stupidest movie that I have had the misfortune of sitting through in the past decade. The preview looked intriguing, until the Queen dance number. I hoped that Heath Ledger, whom I loved in ""The Patriot,"" could somehow make up for the obvious deficiencies. The ONLY reason that I even went was because the movie was playing at the local pizza-and-beer movie pub, and friends wanted to see it. Overall, it just seemed like the director could not decide between making a period movie and making something silly. The combination just didn't work."
1,not so pleasing,"I haven't even finished this video yet, but I already know that it's not one that I'd watch again. There's nothing really bad about the dialogue, theme, or the actors and actresses. However, there are many parts that aren't convincing in the least, or even realistic for that matter; such as the hairstyles and dancing. My advice is if you want to get a realistic movie, don't bother with this one; but if you want a movie with a hot leading actor and a funny cast tending to that actor, go for it."
1,Save Your Money,This movie ranks right next to Red Tomahawck as one of the worst movie I have seen. The acting is not bad but the story was as cliche ridden as the fifth sequeal to a Rocky movie. You see better stories in old Tarzan movie's. How many time's can you watch a knight get struck while riding a horse. Heath Ledger is the Babe Ruth of knight's. There are no odd's he cannot overcome and man those he overcome the odd's. Superman better watch out. Now if Sylvester Stallone was a knight then you would have a contest. Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish.
2,"Heath Ledger, the only reason to watch this movie.","Very lame movie, if not for my liking of Heath Ledger the movie would be a flop in my opinion."
3,What were they thinking?,"If you can ignore the occasional modern-day outfits clumsily juxtaposed into the medieval scene, and the fight scene at the end, the movie is not too bad. Not great, mind you, but not too bad. See it when you have a party (a girl's slumber party), and can afford to talk through the really silly parts. See it if you think that the knight is ""oh so dreamy"". See it for some of the cool fight scenes ... but don't expect much. One can only wonder at its potential amusement value to MST3K fans."
2,Give me a break!,"This movie and garbage, if you ask me. 1970's pop tunes in the jousting? just plain ridiculous. I saw that they tried to make it funny, but it did'nt hit me at all. Heath Ledger was pretty good at acting but the rest were terrible. The jousting was awesome, that's the only I liked about it."
3,Just Have Fun,"Don't expect too much and have fun. The music, the action and a few good lines. NOT a can't miss movie, but a fun little flick."
1,Where are the 12 minutes of the extended version????,"I was very sad and disappointed that the Blu-Ray version does not contain the extended cut, though the cover shows a picture very similar to the DVD extended version. I really like the movie and I think the High Definition format deserves more."
4,Another summer blockbuster- just not excellent.,"""Thumbs Up!""Tired of boredom? Head off to see A Knight's Tale for historic adventure fun. I just love the battle sequences. Sure, some of the acting was different and some of the scenes in the film, don't quite fit- but the film is great fun. One thing that surprised me about this film was that it had modern day music, which I guess is okay, just not usual. But who wants usual? This film is all around fun."
5,A Knight's Tale,I saw this movie it was the best movie ever. I like movies that have action and romance. You should see it it's worth your money. I can't to wait own on DVD
4,Knights Tale is Fun for the whole family,"A knights tale was a very very entertaining movie, it was cheesy, but was very very fun, the directing was not great and teh acting was not great, but the premise was soo much fun you overlook those facts. I know girls would love it, seeing as my girlfriend did, and for the guys out there, take your girlfriend out to see this, its well worth your money and time enjoy."
2,The perfect movie ...,"... for those who ask little more than sound, motion, and color of a film. The jarringly anachronistic soundtrack will heighten their experience. Viewers possessed of more refined sensibilities beware."
1,Not worthy of Braveheart of Gladiator status,"I bought this DVD expecting an action packed entrancing thriller.This movie has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Others have written saying this movie is in their collection with Braveheart of Gladiator. Let me clear something up. This movie will NEVER be in the same class as Gladiator or Braveheart. Nor can you watch it over and over again like you can with Gladiator and Braveheart. This movie attempts to entrance the audience by it's mix of knights, with modern day music and a sad attempt at comedy. But it comes out as a goofy, boring movie.This movie should be under ""comedy."" Though it is not even worthy of that classification.Have seen better B rated movies. Do not be mislead by the majority of the reviews. Wasted over an hour on this movie."
2,sappy,"this 'movie' was pathetic! Not just because of the bad inapropriate music, but the relationship between this young 'knight' and the 'priestess' or whatever she was. Just another attempt at making men look like saps! The guy begs for this girl(she ain't a women, she doesn't act like one!) and she wipes her feet on his face like so much refuse. I find it insulting and degrading! If woman find they get treated like that in movies made in the past, I find that men get treated that way today in the present! Don't watch this filth! Your only encouraging producers to make more of this gutter trash! Moreover, it isn't a very good roll model for young boys and it makes teenage girls act this way(which they do!)"
2,just plain bad,These are the cleanest looking peasants I've ever seen. Not at all acurate-from music to hairstyles to dancing. This was by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. The saddest part? I paid to see this in the cinema.
5,HEATH LEDGER CAN'T GET ANY HOTTER,This is the best movie EVER! Heath Ledger will TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY! If you are addicted to Heath Ledger (like me) you NEED TO BUY THIS DVD!
2,Painful to watch,"If you are looking for something that is period, or anything even close to serious drama. This movie offers nothing for you. I find it a rather indignant thing to open the the first scene with Queen's We Will Rock You, (being a fan of Queen). The movie has a dull plot. The best lines are delivered by secondary characters only. Chaucer is a riot, and is the whole reason to even give a passing glance at this one. The jousting scenes are ...[bad], and somehow, althought not surprisingly all the same."
4,Great!,"I went in thinking this movie was going to be a sore adventure movie with a lot of romance, however, that was not the case at all. It was highly entertaining, lots of great action and the jousting scenes are fantastic. Not too much overkill on the romance, but enought to keep the story moving. The soundtrack is good ole' fashion rock and roll and there's plenty of laughs. I definitely plan on getting this DVD when it is released."
5,Great movie!,I saw this movie the second week it came out and was so excited. It was such a great movie. The way they added some modern flair to it made it original and an overall fun ride. One of the opening scenes is great and a must see. I can see how some people don't like that some stuff was modernized but I found it funny and enjoyable.
4,HEATH LEDGER is America's hottest new star!,"Hey i'm no David Manning but I think that Heath Ledger is America's hottest new star. So far he has brought us nothing but quality films with THE PATRIOT and now this brilliant film. The only thing that I can't figure out is why Sony felt that needed to make up false reviews for yhis film..it's great! It has everything, action, comedy, drama. There is never a dull momment. Oh yeah, Anjelina Jolie watch your back because Shannyn Sossamon is great as Ledger's love interest. writer/director Brian Helgeland (PAYBACK) has created a brilliant piece of cinema."
4,Rock and Roll Jousting,"The soundtrack is a character all its own in this film. This is the story of a poor young boy who grows up in the shadow of a jousting champion, who like all champions must one day face the fact that he can no longer be the best.The boy's father is his hero, even though he basically sells him into servitude. He tells his son he can change his destiny, that nothing should stand in his way.This boy lives by those words. This is a typical story of society boundaries and poor boy meets rich girl. With the added character of classical rock and roll matched with medieval backdrop, you'll sit rivoted to your seat anticipating the realistic jousting matches and playing name that tune!"
3,Not meant to be historically accurate,"This film was amusing enough, it was straightforward story-telling, somewhat predictable, not meant to be historical fact, nor that realistic. However, Heath Ledger did a good job and was convincing as the knight/thatcher. The pairing of rock'n'roll music to the film was somewhat strange, I wasn't sure whether it was distracting - drawing my attention away from the plot since the music was so outrageously incompatible, or did it serve to wake me up every once in awhile with it's outlandishness? (Just be prepared for that).Either way, my favorite quote from the movie and the one which resonates the most: ""Can a man change his stars?"""
3,disappointingly unrealistic,"The setting for the movie was supposed to be midevil Europe, but it wasn't very midevil. Since when do peasents chant ""we will rock you""? Other than the setting it was OK, but it was definitly a chick flick. The romance between the hero and the noble woman did not fit in with the action and jousting. If you don't mind a misplaced romance or midevil cheerleaders this movie is alright."
2,An IQ of 75?,"For very little kids, or young girls who want to look at Heath Ledger. He died but that didn't improve the film.History is so boring. It needs to be jazzed up?"
1,What I woudn't to do forget this obscenity...,Having had to endure this obscenity was beyond revolting... what I wouldn't do to forget the horror...I would rather stick foreign objects in my rear end than have to see this again.Pure filth.
5,A Knight's Tale,This is more than a tale. It defines what it means to be a real man. It demonstrates how one can show their love by listening and by following the wish of the one they love over their own will one moment. In another moment one may be required to make a decision that is contrary but proves the pure moral fiber of ones character. It is truly inspiring.A Knight's Tale
3,"Cute movie, good music. Outstanding acting by Sewell.","There really isn't much of a storyline to this movie, but I enjoyed it for what it is - simply entertainment. I liked the soundtrack. Yes, I realize the movie is set in mid-evil times, and the music is rather more of a modern pop rock, but it seems to suit the events. Rufus Sewell is the star here and plays the villian very well, as usual. Has some funny one-liners. Good blu-ray quality."
3,Overall Not That Bad,"Overall not that bad of a flick, but to me, as with others, the intrusion of the modern music really hurt this film. Still it's nice to see an American movie from this current decade set in the past, and the scene in which the camera flew over a panoramic fourteenth-century London was worth an Amazon star in and of itself. Heath Ledger is likable here as everywhere, and the sub-story of Geoffrey Chaucer's pseudo-inspiration for his own Knight's Tale added some much needed grounding to what might otherwise have been way too free-flying a production."
2,"Love this movie, hate the blu-ray edition","I have always loved this movie since I saw it in theaters, so this review has nothing to do with the actual movie, but with the blu-ray edition. I have this movie on DVD and there are special features on it, commentaries, deleted scenese, extended scenes. This blu-ray has no special features menu at all. I felt kind of jipped, on this blu-ray."
3,Just As Good As the Arcade,"This game is awesome, a whole lot of fun. I remember when I used to plug so many quarters into the arcade version of this game, and spend hours shooting alien scum. This version for the playstation has all of the same pros to it. Only one con: without a gun (like the Interact Lightblaster), control is hardly worth attempting. A definite riot for two players."
4,good game if u have the right gun,AREA 51 is a cool game just like the arcade. but it is only compatible with a few guns. and if u dont have the correct gun it is not that great. so before u get the game make sure u have the right gun.
2,Fun but little replay value,Its a fun game but there is no reason to play it much more than a few times. Only good with gun controllers rather than the normal ones. Better left to the arcade.
4,A New commer,"I though this was a grate movie, I love scary movies so i hope this become another Friday the 13 or Halloween and its drag on for a long time."
1,The worst movie ever made? It just might be.,"I won't bore you with a description of what's wrong with this movie because nothing at all works in it. From the derivative plot to the lame acting to the ridiculous ""twist"" ending, this movie is bad from start to finish. If you like bad movies or just want to torture yourself, then this might be a film for you. OK, it probably isn't the worst movie ever made (in a world with Baby Geniuses, Glitter, and Showgirls how could it be?), but it is God-awful. Renting this film would be a mistake. Just stear clear altogether."
2,ONE OF THE WORST HORROR FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN,"The idea for a good slasher film is there, nerdy guy gets dumped on by hot chicks, comes back to get even in the end. Unfortunately the best I could say about the movie was ""it's a good idea"". From the opening sequence (kinda looks like a copy of Carrie), this movie lacked originality, taking ideas from other films and making them seem cliche, from the killer in a mask to having a victim hiding in a morgue only to get caught. Overall this flick was disappointing at best, at some times I wanted to shut it off and put myself out of my misery. DON'T WASTE YOUR HOUR AND A HALF ON THIS ONE! IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST HORROR FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN."
2,"WELL, HERE WE GO AGAIN","JUST WHAT THE WORLD NEEDED, ANOTHER SCREAM-TYPE HORROR MOVIE. A MISTREATED BOY GROWS UP TO BE A SERIAL KILLER. JUST YOUR AVERAGE TEENAGE HORROR FLICK. HAS SOME OK MURDER SEQUENCES, BUT IT LACKS SUBSTANCE. DENISE RICHARDS IS GOOD FOR EYE CANDY BUT SHE CAN'T HELP SAVE THIS CLICHE'S HORROR MOVIE. IF YOU WANNA SEE THE AVERAGE MASKED MAN GOES ON A KILLING SPREE MOVIE, THEN THIS ONE JUST MIGHT APPEAL TO YOU."
1,Stupid and ilogical,"Valentine started out good. It could of been a much better movie if they handled it well. The movie is predictable as nothing i have ever seen. Some of the killing scenes are ilogical and not original. For example: At a party girl hits the killer who falls unconscious, but instead of running were are all the people are, she runs in a room and hides, and I think you can guess what happens next. The story plot was original, but the movie overall was bad. The movie gives us so many clues as to who the killer is. There are scenes that have nothing to do with the movie and are put anyway. The ending would of been nice and surprising without the obvious clues. If you want to see a good scary movie see Scream, Urban Legend, Halloween, etc. Valentine could of been better. In the movie every time the camera follows a person who is alone, that person is killed, And I mean always except of course for the main character."
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible movie, if it were not for Denise Richards I would have turned it off after 10min. Watch it on mute if you do buy iy."
3,"not a love storie ,but another slasher flick","AS far as low budget Slasher flicks go this was good.in my opion better then most of those 90-slasher flicks.In a Nut shell A Rejected jr high boy 13 years later goes after the girls who turned him down @ the school dance ,all those years ago.The movie over all is good entertainment,the surprise ending &who done it format help push this movie up to a 3 (plus the 2.5 isn't a choice here-lol).If you go ,Watch the charecter with the nose bleed-this part of the movie leaves ,it open for the series that is sure to follow.HORROR HAS A NEW HOLIDAY IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY!!"
1,Return to Sender. Unopened.,"""Valentine"" is a toothless, vapid rehash of the slasher flick, done straightfaced with zero irony or chills. It's beautifully shot and well-produced, but, Lord, is it boring. Ripping off ""Scream,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Carrie,"" and at least a half-dozen other horror films, it doesn't stray far from what we've seen before. Someone, somewhere, was convinced that Denise Richards can act, but her blank performance says otherwise. Ditto the wonderfully bland David Boreanaz, whose screen presence has all the flavor of rice cakes. Despite the well-staged slashings and so-called surprise ending, ""Valentine"" is much ado about nuttin'. Return this baby to sender."
1,Really BAD,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I have rarely seen such poor writing. The ""twist"" at the end was stupid and tried to be confusing on purpose. It wasn't. It was just stupid. If you took out all the scenes that were not needed to advance the story, you would have a 15 minute film. Without David and Denise, I doubt this film would have ever been seen in theatres. It isn't scary at all. It's just BAD. For proof, listen to the director commentary. Most of his comments are about everything he did wrong and why certain scenes do not make any sense at all. That's right - the director of the film explains why his own movie is bad. Don't believe me? Listen to it. Oh, wait - Don't. Peel some wallpaper instead. It is much more fun."
2,Disposable,"'Valentine' gets firmly lumped into the post-'Scream' series of horror movie clichés.Like the 'Urban Legend', and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' movies, 'Valentine' isn't by any stretch the worst movie I've ever seen, but creatively, it leaves a LOT to be desired.Just as it's predecessors, 'Valentine' is an ultimately-unfulfilling clone that's only to be viewed on basic cable or the WB network. You'd kick yourself for buying it."
3,"Mixed feelings, scary yet predictable","I really have mixed feelings concerning this movie. It is kind of thrilling and scary but at the same time too predictable. I guess that if you are the type of person who likes to figure out what is going to happen before it does, this would be good for you. It does have a twist at the end if you haven't been following the movie too closely. A definite rental for a Halloween party.A group of friends from school suddenly start ending up murdered, along with a lot of other people! Is it the nerd from their past who they all suspect? Or is that just what someone wants them to think? Put your detective skills to use and crack this mystery before everyone else watching it with you does!"
4,Look Out! Cupid's Got A Knife!...,"VALENTINE is a terrific homage / tribute / throwback movie. Watching it takes me back to the gory-glory days of 70s and 80s classics like HALLOWEEN, PROM NIGHT, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE, etc. I love the cherub-masked killer! There's just something very unsettling about a giant baby w/ a butcher-knife! As for the gorgeous gaggle of gals, I must say that I was impressed! Denise Richards (Starship Troopers, Wild Things) and co. are all knockouts, even while being knocked off! So, if you pine away for those good old days of SSS (Silent Sinister Stalkers), beautiful victims, and mobs of red-herrings, then VALENTINE should do you true..."
2,This movie just sreams originality..,"Ok, so I lied. This movie is a ""painful"" film with an unbelievable plot and too many plot holes to point a stick at. The performances are dismal, and the actors hardly look as though they were remotely interested in their characters. Although ""Jamie Blanks'"" previous attempt 'Urban Legends' was not a box office breaker, at least some of the ideas worked. This film has poor dialogue and generates no sense of atmosphere for the viewer. Personally, I would rather stare at my eye lids."
2,"in the tradition of other slasher flicks, not the worst","its not the worst of the slasher flicks but it lages in its wooden characters and its dumb twists and turns, though the end with Boreanaz is great, a must see for fans of Boreanaz"
4,Good Scares in Valentine,"I am now proud to say that I like scary movies, for these recent movies like ""Urban Legend"", ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"", ""Scream"", and... VALENTINE. ""Valentine"" surprised me; itá a very good slasher. The cast is great, with Denise Richards (Wild Things), Jessica Cauffiel (Urban Legends: Final Cut) and David Boreanaz (Angel). Jamie Blanks done a very good job again. (He is the director of ""Urban Legend""). I can't hardly wait for the DVD."
2,"Good kills, great end but, what about the plot????","Great things here: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Blood, great music and great kills,The plot is so stupid, that it's even bad for a slasher film.And it's a little boring too, it gets good only when it ends.Denise Richard, AHH!, such a lovely girl, but such a bad actrees.She only use two facial exoresions in the film, she [stinks]!!!!But, like i say in all my horror/slashers reviews.If you like this genre, you'll love this film."
3,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be...,"with that said this movie isn't a masterpiece either. the killer is obvious,but thanks to a nice little twist in the ending it becomes less so. the actresses make good eye candy with Denise Richards never breaking her sex pot image. it's only a shame that Katherine Heigl wasn't in more of the movie because she was one of the better actresses."
1,buy the dvd and play frisbee with it,"unless you are a 15 year old adolescent boy who likes to look at full figured female bodies, dont bother"
1,David Boreanaz Fans Don't Waste Your time.,"I was so disappointed with this film. I had hoped this movie would show off David Boreanaz's talent. Who knows. Maybe he doesn't have any, beyond what we see on Angel (I doubt that though). This role was a re-hash of Angel. Brooding and skulking. Don't ask him to try something new. Don't take advantage of his obvious comedic abilities. The ending was so obvious about 5 minutes into the film. Of course the ugly boy will become the handsome, sexy male. Gee, who'd a thunk it."
3,Nothing too special,"Ya know it's sad. I was that kid on Valentine's day everyone, even like my best friend ignored. Hence why it was called Singles awareness day. And to be honest, I didn't even give a rat's (censored to be allowed online... please webmasters, we love you) about this movie. I mean Denise is a little hottie who married stupidly, much like Catherine Zeta Jones, and the rest are people I didn't know about.Then i started watching Angel.Let's face it, this movie would have been idiotic if it wasn't for Borenaz. Look at all the other reviews, the biggest shout outs over and over go to David. So I'm going to go with the crowd. The movie is a slasher film that shows how cruel highschool and beautiful women can be. But in the end, it was actually pretty funny... all because of Angel lol."
5,Valentine delivers sweets and candies,i loved this movie and i own it on DVD and you should get it now because it is a clever thriller for all horror fans and delivers real valentine sweets!
1,Nobody want's to be this Mama's boys Valentine.,"Your typical, average, unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn't like. Not only that, People that don't like him. That don't love him. This whole things has been done to death and I'm sick of it. Enough with the killer's in masks. Many others have come before this one. Some where more entertaining than others but still, give it a rest already. Nothing is done different and everything is flawed in this movie. It's a complete waste of time.Here's a list of all the others that seem EXACTLY similiar to this undying tune:1. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER2. I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER3. SCREAM4. SCREAM 25. SCREAM 36. HIGHSCHOOL DEATH7. THE ENTIRE JASON VORHEES SERIES8. THE ENTIRE MICHAEL MEYERS SERIES9. URBAN LEGEND10. URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUTfINAL vERDICT: This deserves to be forgotten."
2,There was Capshaw's Bf There was that other guy why david?,"I have to say, wasn't Angelus Evil enough that they have to give away Adam too?I am really Angry with the writer!all though i liked the way the killer killed and the Sexyness of the party, and the Dromatic killing scene of Paige (DANISE RICHARDS) and especially the killing scene of that girl, you know arrows, Falling into the garbage box, and i really liked the killing scene of shelly, it was really scary and looked painful, one slash and kill finished.Anyway, i didn't like this insult of Boreanaz, so i can't give it more than 2 stars."
2,"Two-Three Star Beginning, Spirals Downhill Fast! Terrible.","It is a real toss-up whether to give this One Star or Two Stars. In my opinion, I give it 2-3 stars for the first half of the movie, 1 star for the last half, and -1, for the ending. this movie starts out decent, including a funny 'speed dating' segment. The movie just spirals downhill getting worse and worse until it finally ends in a STUPID UNINTERESTING INSULTING MESS. Denise Richards is beautiful, but her character is really very dull. This is basically a cheesy teen slasher that insults anyone with even half a brain. I gave it two stars because it had some decent moments in the begining. I'd pass on this terrible movie. You should see the director and his commentary--he is terrible. I can't believe he could actually film a movie :-)"
1,Blah,"So, who was the killer? Was it the kid they picked on? Was it Adam? (was he the kid they picked on in disguise?) Was it Dorothy? What about the psycho guy in the beginning (Jason)? Why does he show up later? What point does the neurotic chic that keeps bugging Cameron have? Talk about loose ends! The cast was great and showed great talent, but I think that talent was severly wasted on pointlessness. The movie could have had great potential, but really kinda wanders off and doesn't make any sense. It's basically a big gore-fest. If you don't have to pay for it, watch it all you want, I don't suggest wasting the money to rent it."
2,Not much of a horror...,"Well, I do not say it is not entertaining, however there is a long way before I call it 'horror' etc. Actually it is addressed to teenagers rather than adults . When I went to see this one,I was expecting murder cases with investigations, like I read in some mysterious -horror books by skilled authors. Then it turned out to be the sort - creating horror by force so the customer will think it is horror and get scared, which it is not so.All based on girls' valentines - this movie is just an empty plastic bag with some nice colours."
4,Decent movie - The book is much better!,"Believe it or not - this movie is loosely based on the book ""Valentine"" by Tom Savage. Really, the only similarity between the book and the movie is the concept of five school friends being killed on Valentine's Day (even the characters names in the book were changed for the movie!) While the movie turns out to be a slasher flick, the book is more of a murder/suspense novel.Surprisingly, even after reading the book first, I liked the movie. However, while I give the movie 4 stars, I give the book 5 stars and definitely recommend that you read the book."
1,NOT AGAIN!,"This movie is another ""teen slasher"" movie. It is just the same instead of Denise Richards. You wanna watch Denise Richards? Buy this movie.. You wanna watch a good movie? DO NOT waste your money please. --Let me tell you the movie: there is a killer, and he naturally kills the beautiful girls one by one.. THE END"
3,Good movie!!!,"This movie is o.kIt's not the best movie I've erver seen but it contains great acting. David Boreanaz(TV's Angel), Denise Richards(Drop dead gorgeous, undercover brother) and one of my all time favourite actress Katherine Heigl(My father the hero, TV's Roswell).This movie is a great horror flick but it's not so scary. I really liked the little appearence of Katherine Heigl as Shelley. She died too fast but it was good. Great fans of Angel and Buffy could see Charisma Carpenter as a guest in Dorothy's party. Overall, you should see this movie late at night when you feel to listen to a scary movie."
1,Garbage,"Dumb revenge flick most-likely inspired by a writer's negative experiences with women. I recommend playing this while waiting for your flu medication to kick in. Might be an okay movie to have on as background noise. Other than that, avoid this one."
1,Tom Savage should sue,"This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen. Whereas the book was a five star thriller, the movie is just another cheap slasher film with absolutely nothing to redeem it from the crap that it is. I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear ""Valentine"" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie. In fact I recently reread the book and realized, with the exception of the title, the book is an entirely different story. If you have not seen the movie, don't waste your time, read the book instead."
2,"It Could Have Been So Good, but... Spoiler","I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film. But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out. Scream was good everything else is just redundant. Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that. He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better. This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good."
2,The usual sex and violence flick,"Come on guys, why use your acting talent on an average script like this one?David Boreanaz basically transplanted his Angel good-guy persona onto this movie. We never see him being bad. He is capable of much more complex work, as he showed several times in the Angel TV series.The same can be said of Denise Richards. She is beautiful, and she plays the vixen well, but the complexity is beneath her talent.The script is average, and the premise is tired. I know you moviemakers and team all have to earn a living, but we live for your work, so don't disappoint us so!"
2,Wait For Cable,This is a routine slasher movies that lacks the stylish murders that Argento or Bava would have created.
2,Valentines Day Never Looked So Bad. 3/10,"I am a huge horror fan and was expecting a really good horror but instead I got a boring thriller. The death scenes are so boring,there is no action the killer just kills his victims and there is no chase. I mean the story was okay but it did drag a little and you could tell who the killer was right away.I think Denise Richards did pretty well but her death scene was too cheasy. I feel her character was a pretty strong woman but her death was weak, they could've used a little more action on her part. Also there is a character named Lily who I enjoyed and then she died it was so stupid because the killer shot her with arrows and she just stood there. The ending was so stupid and way too dark believe me this is one valentine you will wanna skip."
3,So-So,"At first this show is, I don't know how to explain it besides saying DELICIOUS! It is about 3 stars at first but after watchin it once or twice it gets slow very quickly and becomes a one or two. I would give it that rating, BUT it IS a horror movie and it is basically the most blood-and-guts movie there is."
1,This game sucks,"Yes, the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time. I rented it and I'm glad thats all I did.Tip to the people who are considering on buying this game, rent it first because you don't want to get stuck with this game."
2,Not as good as I thought,"When I got this game I was expecting some fast and furious gameplay. Thats all I got. The graphics are good, but the gameplay is horrible!!! For some one like me, who loves statistics and seeing how well your players are doing individually midway through the season, forget it. NO STATISTICS!!! You can't put players at different positions, and create players or have roster changes, because it simply won't let you have this simple option. Besides that it has dumb gimics like playing against a team of dolphins, why??? There is no point to playing the game since you can't see h ow well you team is doing individually or any of that stuff. It's just play play play, and it gets boring and redundant after a while. I recommend renting it first, thats what I did."
4,Every Italian Should have the game!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best soccer game i every played, u can foul someone so hard the reff will just be like, what, what, what happen who got hurt. The only thing i think that the game should have is a practice shootout, pentally kicks, and cornors kicks. So u get to know the game better and know how to the mortal combat kicks. Buy the Game its the best!!! ... Buy it!!!"
4,Good Mix of Simulation & Fun,"In a nutshell, this game is a cross between EA Sports' FIFA soccer series and NBA Street. The flow of the game and the controls are similar to the FIFA series, pretty easy to learn. The slant on this game is the relaxed rules, where almost anything goes unpunished. Built into the controls are flying kicks, head butts, and take downs. On the offense side are Matrix-like goal shots. The game has just the right mixture of arcade and simulation to be enjoyable both in 1 player and 2 player modes."
1,not worth it. ..,"Game is simply not fun. Graphics are good, but the game play and ai are horrible compared to the competitors. Rent it first"
2,NO GoooaaaaaLLLLLLLLL!!!!! FIFA is Better.,"I expected alittle more from this game. I thought the game would be easy to play, but the controls are very awkward. I prefer FIFA alot more. You never get a good ""feel"" for the game where it feels like your really playing.--BUT.....I really love the announcers!! You can change the announcers to a few other languages!!! This is the first time I ever saw this! I love the Spanish announcers--GoooaaaaaLLLLLLL!!!GOL,GOL,GOL,GOL,GOL!!!!!--They sound awesome just like on t.v.--But if it weren't for the feature of changing the language of the announcers, I would probably trade this one in tomorrow!!I think Fifa World cup is the best, I just wish they had more teams."
1,If you like to smash things and nothing else...,"If you like to smash things and do nothing else, then this game is for you. While it is fun at first, choosing your giant character and crushing things, it gets real old real fast. The cities you encounter look remarkably (unremarkably) alike. The controls are tight but there are very limited actions to perform. There is very little challenge to this game, as it offers unlimited replays. Playing with or against friends will offer another avenue, but still, it is more of the same. The music is also repetitive and the so-called enemies (police, tanks, civilians) are the same with every level. While the cartoonish appearance of this game may appeal to some, it doesn't make for any real substance. Rent it first before you buy...replay value is minimal at best. Try Spiderman if you want more action and substance."
1,Here's a game I could have done without,"Is this series still around? Why? This game gets old REAL fast and is a waste a time. I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about this game. The music is...nevermind. Well, the graphics are...forget I said anything. Thanks a lot, Midway."
2,A fun game... for the first 20 minutes!,"This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long.I think I'll sell it the first chance I get. I don't care what kind of games you like, don't get this one at all."
1,Extremly desapointing!!,"I first read ""Kane & Abel"" also by J. Archer, this one book was so good that even though I know that second parts are not as good as first parts I wanted to read it.This turn out to be an incredibly disapointing book, so much that I had to make a huge effort to keep reading and dont put the book on the trash.More than half of the book only repeats what we already knew from ""Kane & Abel"", and the rest was just the worst plot ever.How can someone writte so well first and then just be the worst writter ever?I just regret to have buy this book in the first place."
3,A well written book,"The book is okay and is well written, but I would be severely puffing if I said it should be a must read,"
5,Excellent series,Read this one at least 3 times over the years and it never fail to entertain. Nice pacw and depth of characters
2,Too slow of a read.,"I am used to reading more exciting mystery stories. I enjoyed Honor Among Thieves but this one is too slow of a read to keep me interested. I only bought it to be the preview of the other Shall We Tell the President, which I hope will not be as slow."
3,Somewhat tedious.,"Was really enthralled by the initial historical references, but felt I was slogging through the latter part of the story and feel the constant victories were off-putting. Predictable at best."
5,The Prodigal Daughter,After reading Kane and Abel I was told that this was a sort of sequel to the book and I had to read it. Once again I loved this book and the author. Its one of those books where you just want to keep reading and never stop. I highly recommend reading Kane and Abel before reading this book so that you understand the characters more completely. This book does give a shortened introduction of the characters in the beginning but it is recommended by me that you read Kane and Abel which you will enjoy!!!
2,Soap opera,This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
4,"I enjoyed the book, but the prologue...Fantastic!","I enjoyed the book itself, but the prologue is one of the best pieces of writing I've ever encountered. Loved the punchline! If you want to read a satisfying and plausible account of how Florentyna becomes the first woman President, you'll enjoy this book, but be sure to read the prologue!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,An ambitious woman who sacrifices her family to try to become President. I don't know if I was supposed to feel her pain and suffering at her losses. I felt for those who were affected by her ambition. Family comes before ANY job.
1,Just Doesn't Cut It,"As an avid reader of politics I must disagree with popular belief, and say that this book thoroughly disappointed me. Personally, I expect a lot more of Archer and this juvenile, embarrassing excuse of good writing completely stuns me. I have one word for him - edit!"
1,Who Cares?,I read Kane & Abel and think it was perhaps the best book I have ever read. I just could not relate or get care about the 'Prodigal Daughter' Being ambitious is great but not at the expense of your family and loved ones. Very dissapointed.
5,Recommendation with Enthusiasm,"Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one."
1,Wasted Hours.,I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. By the time I realized I had made a mistake starting this book I had so much time invested that I was determined to finish it. A very long book with little to keep you interested and every predicament had a predictable outcome.
3,"Dated, But a Further Taste of Kane and Abel","I was happy to read this book because it was so hard to come to the end of its predecessor, Kane and Abel. The latter was a better book and in Daughter there seemed to be a lot of formulaic replays in presenting the characters and what they'll do next. When it was written, the idea of a female president thrilled the American imagination as we had had a real contender for that happening in our country. Now, with a black man in the White House and women's lib a bit of a banality (with Rupert Murdoch, the inspiration for a character in another Archer novel, The Fourth Estate, rapidly feminizing the Wall Street Journal as we speak) this story's innovative edge has been lost. Still, as with all Jeffery Archer's tales, it offers an entertaining escape by a writer who knows how to put together a decent read."
4,great table,This table is perfect for my two girls ages 2 and 4. It's not built to last a decade but I am very pleased with it. It's pretty and practical.
3,Another Skimpy Hits Album,"Missing a lot of songs, particularly from Head To The Sky. Concentrates solely on radio hits and does not add too much else. You could probably add about five more songs onto this CD."
5,All the goodness wrapped into one.,This cd is exactly what is needed for those of us who want it all in one shot. No need to fish around for each seperate cd. It's all right here wrapped up into one beautiful sensual package.
3,Tastes have changed,"I haven't enjoyed this as much as I did when I was younger. This band is still very talented, but perhaps not as ageless as I had hoped! I grew tired of the CD very quickly."
5,What's not to like?!,I don't purchase many CDs so I wanted the best of EW&F. That's what you get on this disk. Yeah!! :)
5,Can't stop the groove,"I love this CD. I play it over and over. You can't help a smile from creeping across your face when you hear it. And ""September"" forget about it..you're off the chair and dancing. Don't fight it. It is a feel good album that pleases all."
4,Modern and concise approach to the subject.,"This is a clearly exposed text on Statistical Mechanics, with a very modern approach. I find the problems particularly interesting (look for the Solution Manual of this title)."
4,Novel thoughts but too concise,"The book starts with an adiabatic system instead of isolated system, which makes the following derivation more pretty and casts a new insight into the stat. mech.. The only flaw is that it is too concise."
3,Not a good book for beginners,"This book is very brief, and a nice reference to have, but I would not recommend for an introduction to statistical mechanics. McQuarrie's text is much more thorough, and great for a upper level undergraduate or graduate course. For a very basic overview of the canonical ensemble Molecular Thermodynamics, by McQuarrie and Simon is a nice resource. Overall, Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics is stat mech in its briefest form, and useful for a physical chemist's reference shelf."
1,Joke is in your hand,"Worst movie I see this year the trailer was better then the movie. It just gets lamer as I watched and the movie is 40 min too long. For a hall pass movie you would expect to see some nude females but this movie is PG when it comes to females then it has a scene with two naked guys showing it all this is the reason it is Rated R but come on. Except for that jokes are those you taught were funny in high school, the guys pretend to be super stupid and lame whats with all the nasty bathroom humor and I mean real defecation, do not while watching this or you will be puking next out of nastiness rank 10 out 10 on nastiness level."
1,Hollywood is clamoring for the life boats.,"Most of my favorite actors have already abandoned Hollywood and are wisely pursuing their own careers. The rest, of course, have signed on to this mess of a movie. This film contains every single actor and actress that are still aboard and rapidly sinking with the ship.Sure, there are very talented writers out there trying to pitch their ideas to Hollywood, but Hollywood is still going with horrible scripts written by their first cousin's brother-in-law. And their lack of vision shows. Nay, it shines!Inspired by a book of 100 dirty jokes, this flick fails to amuse, and least importantly, completely wastes your time. Instead, I encourage everyone to turn this stupidity off, and go out and do some good in the world!"
1,Item is not as described,"I order this item, and it is not a blu-ray/dvd/digital combo pack. I only received a blu-ray disc. That is it. I love the movie, and was extremely disappointed when it arrived. I have processed a return, but I don't know how to get the combo pack, since this is described as a combo pack???"
3,Fake Chowder,"The Movie Was Pretty Funny Not Great Tho, I Thought The Sound Track Was Great! Alotta New Kewl Tunes In It!"
3,it's just ok,"this is an ok movie with a couple of funny moments, but leaves you wanting. If your real bored, then it might get the job done."
4,"Cute movie, good transfer",This is a very light hearted comedy that is fun to watch when you want to forget about your work day. The AQ and HQ are good transfers to HD.
3,It's weird....,It doesn't start at the beginning... it skips to about 5 or 6 minutes into the film. Not a big deal.. just seems kinda sketchy. There's no menu or previews.
2,Interesting idea but didn't work out,"This seems like a great potential story: two men are given a week off from their marriage to do whatever they want. It didn't work out that way. The movie bombed. The acting by the male characters, especially Sudekis', was marginal, and the ending was trite and predictable--and a lame car chase scene didn't help. Of course, these guys were not going to cheat on their wives, duh.What could have been a decent movie was almost unwatchable. Of course, a mandatory car race occurs at the end, which does nothing to enhance the quality of this movie. Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate did a respectable performance as the idiots' wives, but it wasn't enough to save this stinker."
4,Very entertaining,"Some people complained about the male genitalia being shown, but it was part of a joke, a disgusting joke, but still women have to see topless girls in almost every film this is our turn to take one for the team. All in all the movie is funny. I'd recommend watching it atleast once. Ending is pretty hilarious and Alexandra Daddario needs more roles, she is stunning."
2,Flatulently unfunny,"Another comedy with no actual comedy. Who watches this trash? The IQ level is sub-moronic. Now, I like gross-out humor as much as the next guy, but, please, entertain me while doing it. This mess never gets off the ground. The concept is dumb, as two middle-aged white guys get a hall pass from their wives to live it up like they are single for a week. Chaos and boredom ensue. ZZZZZzzzzzz."
2,Lost interest after the hot tub scene.,"This movie had plenty of laughs, but I lost all interest after the two naked men pull owen wilson from the hot tub. Could have totally done without seeing that. If you can overlook that scene then I guess it was an alright move, maybe 3 1/2 stars."
3,Funny and dramatic real life tie in,Hall Pass starts out as the typical comedy and ends up a drama that illustrates the fact that the grass is NOT always greener on the other side. The movie has some great funny scenes and I believe it factually portrays that a spouse may feel there are better options out there when they should be happy with what and who they have. It's a good movie with comedy and a good message overall.
5,Love it!,"Awesome and fast service. Also, love the movie. Almost had a role I'm this film. Great to see the outcome."
4,Great,"really funny...must see. was not sure if it would make the cut but surprisingly did, ha d me rolling. its just a must own DVD."
3,Not A Life Changing Event Movie,"The Farrellys ruled the roost in the Nineties with ""There's Something About Mary"" their masterwork. Somewhere around ""Stuck On You"" they lost their way. Meanwhile Jud Apatow and Todd Phillips passed the boys in the outrageous comedy department. The Farrellys try to reclaim their throne here but no dice. They appropriate elements of Apatow and Phillips with some of their own fluorish but it's an uneasy mixture. This is far from a bad film but it's hardly a good one. I did like Owen Wilson but Jason Sudeikis was something of an oaf. This is a case of the Farrellys being victims of their previous success and being overcome by their progeny."
4,Every Married Man's Dream,"Parts of this movie could be just too real, but if I had the chance I'd use my hall pass and make my wife participate. She'd never cook up a hall pass again.Or, would she? Hmmm."
3,just alright,"i'm an Owen Wilson fan so I had to watch this movie. there are some really funny parts on it like when they didn't know they were being watched on the video camera at their friend's house. but there are some scenes that I didn't really like too much. it's an average comedy I guess, but it's definitely not great. i was a little disappointed."
1,Inversely Proportional to # of Songs,"Besides a poorly designed and viewer unfriendly DVD menu (e.g. lack of chapter or subtile options) the next obvious criterion for quickly discerning the quality of a movie is the number of songs used as a filler for lack of acting, story, script, directing, etc. and this production had 42, yes 42 songs of mostly poor unknown quality at that. Possibly a record for any movie in history thus far. The over 17 rating forewarning at the beginning tells of ""crude sexual language"" that plus filler music plus the principal theme of old guys looking at young females should tell us something about the value of 90 minutes of American time. The only explanation is that these rom-coms must be produced for lonely dissatisfied American men and women still stuck in some adolescent fantasy world.The only surprise is that neither a N.Y. or L.A. studio was the customary cash cow assembly line source for this well worn redundant genre. Money speaks and Atlanta listened."
1,Farrelly brothers no more,"they ruined the careers of some fine actors. Everything was bad, even the lighting was horrible like I had a bad copy (no this is NOT special effects). The acting was as if they said, here read your lines. Out of an hour and a half I maybe laughed for one minute. While the idea would make for a great story, it was like a home movie trying too hard."
1,Not as advertised,"Item description said that this was the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy, the product I received did not have the digital copy..."
1,Horrible,"Another movie with good actors but a stupid, predictable plot.Did I mention it was horrible and a complete waste of time."
2,"had a couple laughs but,","hall pass had a somewhat cool concept, but could've done way better. it had a couple laughs here and there, but it wasn't anything super hysterical or anything i would bring up to someone in conversation. about 3/4 into the movie i was over it and just wanted it to end. i probably wouldn't watch it again, even out of absolute boredom. worth a try, but it won't be anything spectacular."
3,So so so so disappointing,"I was expecting such a good movie out of this one but some parts where so bad I had trouble watching it. It's not really even a comedy it has some funny parts but to me it felt more like a life lesson movie that tried to use stale humor to get people to watch it.It had some funny parts don't' get me wrong I just would not consider this a comedy nor would I recommend owning it. If you really want to see this rent it and enjoy, I would love to hear feedback on this one.....Maybe I am just missing it"
2,A recipe to cure a dull marriage,"The men of the movie take their wives for granted so the wives grant them a hall pass - do what they want for a week. Of course, the men are so out of practice and completely tame from years of marriage that they really do nothing...a little unbelievable, given the married men I know. Of course, the wives have an effortless time getting something going with new men, so the Hall Pass kinda backfires. It was funny in places but the ending is bad, with one of the characters getting away with her transgression a little to easily to be rewarding. Not the Farelly Brothers best."
2,"Pathetically Derivative Screenplay, Predictable Average Direction","What does it say when the best parts of a film are in the outtakes?Pathetically derivative screenplay and predictably average direction. Pretty much what you would expect mixing 'Fried Green Tomatoes' with 'The Hangover'.The best gag: Stephen Merchant in one of the outtakes. One could say that his most prominent presence comes at the end - and takes place there too. X-DYikes, I'm going to have a difficult time watching/listening to the man when he does his bit on the Ricky Gervais Show and the upcoming 'An Idiot Abroad, The Bucket List'. {:-DBut you can't really rate one funny scene and one sexy scene beyond anything execpt barely palatable. And it's only Merchant's outtake and the outtake with beautiful Christina Applegate pulling her head out of a lap (yahoo!) that saves this from the one-star garbage pile."
3,"Funny, But Nudity Was A Bit Much","This movie was overall pretty funny spare a few things. I was mostly appalled & kinda turned off of it by some of the nudity that was in it. I don't much care for nudity, especially full fledged nudity. In this particular movie, you see 2 dudes fully naked, and it keeps panning back & forth between their private parts. Dude...I don't watch movies to see that kinda crap. I don't know why some movie producers & directors feel that there needs to be that kinda crap in movies. It was perfectly funny on it's own without that kinda stuff. There was also this part where one of them brings a girl to a hotel room and she has an issue...was kinda disturbing. Didn't care for that. Anyway though, that aside, this was a pretty funny movie. If you're interested in watching it, just be warned of the nudity & such in it."
2,Not as funny as I expected,This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).
2,humor needs some grounding,"You're 40ish. In your dumbest hour, do you go to Applebees to pick up easy women? So so dumb. The couple of laughs can't save this sad excuse for a comedy."
5,"funny, funny, funny movie","I haven't laughed this hard since, Animal House, Vacation, Xmas Vacation and Hangover....loved the movie.....you have to love ""stupid"" (and I say that with a great deal of affection) to love this movie.. I didn't need to try to figure out what was going on and who dunnit and why...just laughed the whole way thru."
2,A few funny parts,Not nearly as funny as I expected but there is some very humorous dialog. I would like to have given it 3 stars but I can't because of one revolting sight gag and the presence of the talent-less Joy Behar. Okay to rent not to own. I doubt that I would ever watch it again.
4,Hilarious,Humor is a bit crude but if you are good with that then this movie is funny. I laughed my %$$ off.
1,I am sorry,"Dear friends: I am sorry I didn't stop this movie after 30 minutes. While any one of us could have done it, it was my house and my responsibility. I had the remote. In my defense, I felt paralyzed, like some sort of reverse stupid-sucking vampire had latched on to me, and was injecting me with stupidity blood. I am also sorry for the previous sentence: it was dumb, like the movie. I will endeavor in the future to recognize that I do not have to continue on a path once I realize that path leads to madness, or at least dumbness."
1,"Funny, if you are 13 and have an IQ of 13.","I usually like Owen Wilson, but this was just awful. It was predictable beyond reason, it was so predictable maybe a computer wrote it. I do not think we laughed one time, which is pretty sad.A good cast, Wilson, Fischer, Applegate, Campbell and so on just completed wasted. Don't bother with it, more hype than results."
2,Terrible.. for even me...and I usually love these guys!,"repetative and boring. One of their first movies that I actually could not finish. I'm not going to write a huge script as to why this movie doesn't work, just know that it didn't. I am very easy to please when it comes to movie selection and almost always love movies that these actors are in but through this movie it was just lame. sorry."
4,As funny as The Hangover,"Disregard the nay-sayer reviews here of this very funny film - to me, it was just as funny as The Hangover (which I feel was way over-rated). Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis make a great team in this, and the rest of the cast is great as well."
2,Hall pass,I was disappointed that this movie used unnecssary nudity and graphic language about sex to get a few laughs. It would have been just as funny without them. I will not recommend this movie to any one. The story line could have been better. Do guy really want to be portrayed as stupid sex addicts?
2,Terrible,Good thing i only spent 99 cents for this movie. There were only a couple of scenes that I found funny and the rest I only felt obligated to see because I spent money on it.
2,Sucked,"Some funny parts here and there, but mostly sucked. It definitely wasn't worth paying to watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but if you could get it free, it might be ok."
4,hillarious,"me and my wife watched this movie, at first we was like ""i dont think so"". but after a few minutes we was rolling on the floor laughing. i would reccommend all married couples to watch this movie."
3,Hall Pass,"It was not as funny as I thought it was going to be...a little flat sometimes and corny, but it was enjoyable."
3,GUN DIGEST,"WAS HOPING FOR MORE MODERN GUNS THAT I WORK ON, NOT GUNS THAT I WILL PROBABLY NEVER COME A CROSS, GOOD BOOK, JUST NOT WHAT I NEEDED."
3,Functional Book,"This book luckily covers most of the guns that I needed, but not enough recent products. Most of the disassembly directions are good, sometimes there are steps that are skipped or not detailed. Not a lot on reassembly, I would prefer more than just reversing the disassembly order."
4,Good pictures,Of the two books on assembly/disassembly I purchased this was the more thorough. It has good pictures on tear down but is a little lacking on reassembly. I was torn between a three and four rating. This book would actually be helpfull if you had not torn down the project firearm before. So I rated it at four. A little more attention to reassembly would be beneficial for us novices and make this a really good book.
3,A Muddled Map,"While this movie offers a terrific performance by Julianne Moore, Signourney Weaver's highly praised interpretation of Alice Goodwin was somewhat uneven. The movie itself suffers from inconsistency, mostly because Alice's motives and attitudes aren't always easy to interpret. It's a frustrating experience, watching ""A Map of the World."" For every powerhouse scene, there's an awkward, muted one. In the end, I don't know how well Weaver conveyed what Alice was supposed to have gained from her troubling experiences. She still seemed somewhat caustic and distant. Was it the screenplay or the direction? Whatever the reaason, this is an uneven and frustrating film, full of good moments and weak ones."
2,To be missed,"""A Map of the World"" adaptation of Jane Hamilton's novel is a sad story of bad luck changing the life of a woman and her family living in Wisconsin country. Snip: (...)"
3,Pare it down,"Sigourney Weaver gives an excellent performance as Alice Goodwin, a woman who undergoes trying times when a friend's child dies while under her care, followed soon after by charges of child abuse against her by members of the small community in which she lives. This is a well-made, sincere film, but I couldn't help feeling that it was just trying to pile on too much drama. I was frustrated by the introduction of the child abuse angle and Alice's subsequent prison stay because I felt that the film had never dealt adequately with the horror of the dead child and all of the emotional consequences of it. The parents simply moved away so we could get into the next crisis before their return. Jane Hamilton probably handled this more successfully in her novel, which was the basis of this film, because she didn't have the time constraints of a movie."
3,Well acted.,Julianne Moore had her usual stellar performance. Sigourney Weaver was just as good with her believable portrayal of a shunned woman.
2,"Flat ambiance, poor scripting","I was really disappointed in this movie. So disappointed, in fact, that I couldn't watch more than the first third of the movie (I kept hoping it would get better). The overall feel of the movie was flat. I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the lack of background music in many parts, but I couldn't get into the emotion that should have come with the movie. Some of the scripting was preposterous such as when some investigators just show up at a school meeting. That just didn't ring true. After that, I quit watching. I couldn't imagine that things would get better."
1,Piece of junk,Bought this shower head/hose for RV replacment. Hose is not very flexible and already has permanent kink in it after 1st use (inner shealth is metal). Waste of money.
5,An expose in the best traditions of THE JUNGLE,"What Gruenfeld does to Wall Street is like what Upton Sinclair did to the meatpacking industry, only a whole lot more entertaining."
5,HIGHEST Recommendation,"I loved every word of this book. Knock your socks off story, rich characters, and as about as relevant as you can possibly get. Will now go read more of this writer's books and hope their half as good."
3,three good pieces - didn't add up to a good whole,"I tried to like this book a lot, and there are several admirable qualities: good writing, excellent sequencing, timely subject, and a quick pace. HOWEVER,It could have been a good suspense story . . .It could have been a great satire . . .It could have been an interesting and thought-provoking investment tutorial . . .Unfortunately, it moved back and forth between them too frequently and left an empty feeling by the end of the book.Too many ""doesn't work that way"" for an investment tutorial, too much informaion about the stock markets/economics for a thriller (all the details are great if you're a WallStreeter but most didn't advance the story), too much of an attempt at mystery for a satire."
1,Plagarism?,"The plot and story, as far as I read, appear to be copied from a Toby Peters mystery written by Stuart Kaminsky quite some time ago. I don't recall which Toby Peter's Hollywood set mystery. I don't intend to finish reading this book, since the Toby Peters' novels aren't my favorite among Kaminsky's many fictioal characters, so why read what appears to be a knockoff. If I am wrong, I apologize to Mr. Woods whose previous novels I've enjoyed."
4,A Nostalgic Take on Hollywood's Beginning,"I had never read anything from Stuart Woods, but I had heard from others that he seemed to be ""writing for the money"". Fortunately, this novel provided an afternoon of pure enjoyment! Telling the tale of disgraced cop turned movie security chief Rick Barron, Woods paints a Hollywood pulled straight from the great noir films of the 30's and 40's."
3,it's a hoot!,"All while I was reading this book I could hear the soundtrack of a 1937 black and white movie. This book has all the elements of a sappy, romantic one, which includes a patriotic view of the war. It has the stilted language of a B movie script. The author even gets Clark Gable, David Niven and Hedda Hopper to do cameo roles. If that isn't enough he gets Bugsy Siegel to make a menacing appearance. Mr. Woods warps history to make the story work, well almost.Even with all this it is still an enjoyable ride in a cream convertible, with the top down."
1,His worst book,"Woods' leading characters seem to be the same person only in different clothing. They also tend to come into money and success repeatedly through pure accident. In most of his books, the story is sufficiently well done that I gloss over this and enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, The Prince of Beverly Hills carries forward the worse aspects of all Woods' plots, but with little plot or story; it meanders around, miraculous things happen to the main character (through little effort of his own) and then ends."
2,Beverly Hills Sleeper,"Definetly not one of Stu's best. I think he needs to stick to the Stone Barrington character, or make Rick Barron's adventures a little more interesting. Maybe Stu needs to read a couple James Patterson novels."
2,"this book sucks, read like a tabloid","mr. woods kept going down the hill but still so actively churning out bad almost barely readable novels year after year. this hollywood detective/cop turning bad story really sucks big time. very bad dialogue and storyline. guess woods simply couldn't get away from hollywood too far.now i rank him under sidney sheldon and harold robbins. give it a rest of this kind of hollywood junk, don't waste too much paper again."
3,Not Your Typical Stuart Woods Book,"At first I was somewhat turned off by the 1930s setting, only because it's out of character for Stuart Woods. Normally he gets my interest the first chapter or two; this one started out a bit slow. But as I continued to read, it did deliver. Woods is one of my favorite authors, but I would have to rate this particular book my least favorite."
2,Fairy tale,"Gossamer thin plot, calling the characters 'characters' is an overstatement because there is no character anywhere. But there's room in popular fiction for fairy tales: Clancy did it in ""Patriot Games,"" Parker has inumerable ones featuring Prince Spenser; so why not join the exploit-your-reputation band wagon of prince-based stories where everything works out perfectly albeit incredibly?The quality of writing in this book is a disappointment for a well-known author, but an entertaining, mindless read."
1,Not up to usual standards,"I have read all of Wood's various books starting with the sailing book he wrote years ago. I have always enjoyed his writting and looked forward to every new book. Sorry to say this book was an extreme dissapointment. Very simple plot lines and a new character who was so much like Stone Barrington I don't know why he even created a new one. Every characteristic of this ""new"" character screamed Stone Barrington to me. This looks like a book that was just tossed out and it is an insult to all the fans of Woods for him to give us a book that he obviously didn't take pride in. I will be more careful with his next book and not just buy it because it is written by Woods."
5,Yeah! Stuart Woods is back!,This is a rollicking read - Woods is at the top of his game - a big improvement over his last book. But the unresolved hit-and-run at the very beginning of the book was unsettling.
3,Not his best work,"I am an avid Stuart Woods reader and eagerly wait for his books.However, this is not up to his usually high standards.Don't get me wrong, it was an easy read but it lacked something. Whether it was the the wit of Barrington or the sensual nature of Holly, I don't know but it definitely was missing some key ingredient. For such an easy read as Woods books are, I didn't get into this book until around page 220 when it finally got some substance.The ending was just not Woods. And what was the fishing trip to Oregon all about?I look forward to reading another Stone Barrington adventure next"
1,This book was just terrible,"I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny."
4,A fun novel to follow along,"I enjoyed this novel for a few reasons. First, it's a new character for Stuart Woods and not one that will spin off his other world of Stone Barrington and Holly Barker. Second is that the setting has changed. Now we are in 1939 Hollywood versus today New York. The mingling with movie stars, media moguls and mobsters was good. The story keeps moving and stays interesting though filled with some how-to-make-a-movie facts. The charater, as usual, continues to follow a string of good luck with wealth and women. And, as usual, is a pilot. Since this is a new character I go along with developing him, this time. Hopefully there will be less ""development"" in the future Rick Barron novels."
4,Enjoyable Mystery,"The MarginThe 1930's, the era of so many things we now take for granted. Illegal booze, motion pictures, commercial airline flights, the depression, and the rise of the Third Reich culmenating in WWII. A perfect setting for a young cop and his misstep, or two.Rick Barron found out that getting his police supervisor's niece pregnant wasn't smart. Demotion from detective back to beat cop was the inevitable outcome. Working the streets one night, he saw an accident at the hands of a drunk driver. Barron recognized the driver, a famous movie star, and he helped him avoid blame in the fatal crash. This, of course, appeals to the star and Barron is offered the prestigious Chief of Security position at the famed studio. The story takes the reader through Barron's various experiences including baby sitting the star, mixing it up with gansters and his eventual act of atonement. You'll not regret reading The Prince of Beverly Hills by Stuart Woods."
4,Essential but should have looked overseas,"If you are really interested by making your own mutual fund, this is an essential book to have. It gives you the require amount of work, the required capital value, the minimum costs, what to do, what to expect, how to team up (you can't do it alone), common mistakes, and good other advices.However you won't find a line on how to set-up your mutual fund in another country than the USA, but it will give you the general idea of what this industry is like (even if you are not creating your fund in the US, what makes your fund a good mutual fund? Find the answer in the book). Since the US has the tightest regulations, making your mutual fund in another country will be easier. Having this book will help you compare the USA with other jurisdictions.Warning: it is illegal to set-up a foreign mutual fund targeted for US-investors."
2,Not for $165,"I'm in the investment business and have sufficient assets under management to start a mutual fund, thus my interest. The book was informative in a basic way but somewhat out of date and no way is it worth $165."
3,Loud and a Struggle,"This little device does chop evenly, which is the only reason I didn't give it a lower rating, however, it is very loud and a real struggle to get unlocked once you are finished chopping. For the money, it will do, but I should have spent a little more and gone with a better brand."
2,Did I just get a lemon?,"I find the reviews that extol this as a long-serving workhorse quite interesting -- and frustrating. I had this chopper and used it only about a half dozen times, though had it over a year. It just stopped working. B&D customer service didn't even express regret at my experience and refused to do anything about it. Since I had a B&D toaster oven (almost $100 on sale) that also gave out after just over a year, I won't be buying any more of their products."
1,waste of money,Very poor quality. Parts don't fit well which makes it difficult to take off the base and put back on. Power button must be pressed HARD.
3,Small items only,"It works just okay. I use choppers mostly for onions when cooking. With this, I have to cut up very small before using. You can't put in too much or it will pulp the stuff on the bottom & not touch the stuff on top.It was cheap. I got what I paid for."
3,Black & DeckerElectric Chpper,"Product does the jobbut container is somewhat flimsy. Should be a more solid plastic cup, Chops the way it is expected to."
1,Doesn't work at all,"i opened it today, after a month of getting this. I doesn't work- when i connect it to power, the blade doesn't turn..Is there anything i need to do and have missed? I have never had a bad experience with anything Amazon sold me before."
2,Used,The box had been repackaged. The push button only worked if the pressure was applied in one small particular spot on the button...my assessment is that the device had been returned as faulty and was resold. I will not be returning so no one else can receive the same faulty item.
5,Very good product,Very good product. Chop or use it for tomato puree. The jar seems to be of weak quality. Hope it lasts. Product received as ordered but was delivered later than what was promised.
4,Good Chopper,I've been using this chopper everyday since I bought it. It made my job of cooking easy by chopping away everything I put in it :)
1,So hard to use I give up and get out my knife,"The chopper will not work unless all parts are lined up exactly right. Although I have had it for several months, it is still very difficult to get them lined up (or know if they are lined up - you just have to try it, then take it back apart and try again). I often give up and get out my knife.If there were very large arrows or something it might help, but a royal pain to use.Note also for many items it is more of a fine shred or puree than a chop; not everyone will like the consistency."
1,Worthless,"I just threw this away. I am a cook and I know what I need and what a good product can do. The pieces don't fit together easily and jiggling and fooling around is necessary to get it to close correctly before it will turn on. Then it jams unless the raw food is already basically diced up. That is why it is worthless. If the food has to be diced up small (carrots, onions, etc) ahead of time, then I don't need this product; I will just continue to cut it up smaller from a basic dice. I will look for a manual hand chopper; this one is not worth the time and frustration."
5,Works great!,"This little chopper does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it very fast. You basically just plug it in and push a button. I will say that because of it's small size, you need to cut the veggies or whatever into manageable chunks. You also need a deft touch on the button because this chopper works so fast you'll have a veggie slush if you're not careful. All in all, a great gadget for the price."
4,Great little chopper!,"I don't have the exact model shown in the picture but a very similar sized B&D chopper. I only use it occasionally if I don't feel like chopping manually and if it's a small enough amount that it's not worth pulling out the full size food processor. Great for mincing onions or garlic and chopping nuts. It chops quickly and as long as you don't overload it, it will chop evenly. I've put the plastics (never the blade) in the dishwasher and it survives just fine. It's a handy tool to keep around and it doesn't take up much cabinet space."
5,"Excellent Appliance For Quick Chopping of Garlic, Onions, Carrots, Seranno Peppers, Jalapenos When you don't Need Full Food Proc","Really handy for chopping garlic, onions, seranno peppers, carrots etc for making items like guacamole, salsa verdi when you don't need to dirty up the whole food processor. This does so well for the veggies above and easy to clean.Great for any cook.Justin"
2,Very Noisy,So noisy. It disturb everybody at home when in operation. Chopping capabilities are okay but not very good. Not suggesting to buy.
2,A chopped chopper.,"This is a cool little appliance, but the only thing it's worth chopping is about half of an onion. It's great for chopping up small amounts needed for certain recipies that may call for a table spoon of minced pepper or garlic, but other than that, spend the extra money on a full sized food processor. I would have to say cute, not functional."
5,Nice Little Chopper,"Lightweight and easy to clean, this is an excellent buy for the price.We have used it to chop everything from fruits to nuts and it has never failed to please."
4,Black & Decker Cup One-Touch Electric Chopper,This little chopper is great for small jobs and when you are in a hurry; I will buy another when needed.
5,the little kitchen workhorse,"I own an older version of this appliance, which I mainly use for chopping nuts, herbs and sometimes onions. It does a superb job on all these tasks. I like that you can readily control the operation with the pulse button. It's so easy to clean. Best of all, it's still kicking after *fifteen years* of use. I would buy another one in a heartbeat."
1,don't buy this piece of junk,"I bought this processor to replace the wonderful B&D mini chopper I'd had for over a decade (only because they finally stopped making new blades for it.) I expected similar quality, but was totally disappointed. The blade assembly does not fit snugly in the cup, so it slips around and doesn't chop well. The base cracked within the first few times I used the unit (with no abuse whatsoever). Shortly thereafter the lid cracked too. At one year old, it is completely worthless and I am replacing it (with a cuisinart)."
1,Big Disappointment!,"The photo on the box displays perfectly diced/chopped veggies. However, I got this item as a gift and when I used it I was greatly disappointed. It recommends ""pulsing"" the button. This does NOT help. You either have to constantly open up the lid and re-adjust the veggies, OR you can hold the button down and you just end up with inedible, unusable vegetable mush. I was really disappointed. I'm trying to figure out how to return mine."
5,Love love love,"My friend had one of these, and I made sure to ask her exactly what kind hers was to get this one - and I'm just as satisfied. It's quick, easy, and very easy cleanup. I used it the first night to chop roasted almonds and it did a beautiful job effortlessly!"
2,Ehhh,"Not very good at all, I bought this to make hummus and it didn't do well at all, never got the mxture to blend well at all and the machine was very noisy also!"
5,Speedy Chopper,This great little gadget makes choppin easy and fun. A great time saver with a minimum mess very easy and quick to clean up.Black & Decker HC306 1-1/2-Cup One-Touch Electric Chopper
5,Easy to use,"This little chopper is just exactly what I was needing. It is small, easy to clean, and does an excellent job of chopping, and mincing. It is not complicated, in fact it has only one little button."
5,Great little chopper!,"This food chopper made be small but it is excellent! Compact but powerful,easy to use,easy to clean. I have a full size food processor and this is a great addition for smaller jobs. I love it and highly recommend this product! You won't be sorry!"
2,Disappointed!!,It really doesn't do what i needed it to do.It was cheap so you get what you pay for.
1,hunk of gunk,"this is a piece of gunk,it does not work.bought 2 of these and it is very loud,do not buy this you will be very dissappointed."
1,"Didn't work, not worth it to exchange under warranty","I received this as a gift and it was dead on arrival. I called Black & Decker customer support and was told that I can exchange it for a working chopper if I paid all the shipping & handling costs of mailing them the plug (for proof) and having them ship me a new one. The total cost comes out to about $9, which isn't worth it considering the $11 price of this chopper. I'm just going to throw it away."
5,Good Chopper,"I bought one recently to replace the one my daughter broke accidentally. Not an issue of quality by the way.This is a good product. However it does not chop the nuts equally....depending on what you are using it for that may not matter. I don't mind most of the time.Although, Grandma has taught me to use the old fashioned hand crank one when needed :)"
1,do not buy this,"i receive it, now to plug and go.Smoke came out of itlow money=low quality......................................."
1,Lousy at chopping and surely doesn't pulse,"$15.99 wasted on this useless gadget. The positives: small and portable, looks nice and cleans up easily. The real deal: it doesn't really chop or pulse (ironically with a pulse button), except making loud noises and spins the food around in the safety-locked bowl. I would have packed it up for return had I not kept it in the cabinet for months before taking a test drive. After one use this shiny toy is going into the donation bin.Usually I am pretty good at reading up reviews and doing research before making a purchase. Guess I bought into the hype of glowing user reviews and Amazon Best Sellers Ranking status. Who wouldn't want a good looking, portable, cheap yet powerful food chopper that also pulses amazingly? Sadly, this isn't it."
2,Hate It!,"I bought this bigger chopper to replace a much small one, to save time. What I ended up with was a chopper that took more time to chop because the blade keeps popping up when it is turned on. The food pushes up against the blade as it chops, there is nothing that holds it down to stop this from occurring. What a waste of money and time, I would not recommend."
1,"Chopping? Uhm, no.","This B&D is the right size and its small footprint would make it perfect for my kitchen...if only it did what it's supposed to do! It doesn't really chop, it turns things into mush - as if you had used a blender. Even experimenting with pulsing time and length doesn't yield chopped produce for, say, making salsa (I wish it turned out salsa as good-looking as the product picture). May be good for baby food, but if chopping is what you need, this isn't the right tool for that. Oh, and let's not forget to mention that it is also extremely loud. No, thanks."
4,good chopper for the price,"If you are a single person or don't do all that much sophisticated chopping this is ideal. If you want a bunch of controls for a variety of chop styles then this is not for you. Controlling the time of chop by learning to pulse the chop button does the trick for most items. Simple, easy to use for most people. The only negative I have is cleaning, WATCH OUT! those little wings on the chopper are sharp. Overall, a good rating and if it holds up ( I just got mine about a month ago) it is well worth the price. Quick chop on onions, peppers and ham slice for western omlet is just the thing."
2,Marginal utility,This product varies little from a small size blender. It is a stretch to label it a chopper. It is incapable of chopping raw carrots and minces onions into small particles. It lacks the power to handle difficult chopping assignments.
4,Black & Decker Chopper works well but...,"It does a nice job of chopping up my veggies, but sometimes the size it chops to is too fine for when you want a thicker cut. Otherwise, it's a very good product."
2,Motor died after few uses,"This machine worked fine until it just stopped. Although we'd had it maybe two years, it was not used often, maybe 20 times tops. So rather disappointed. Called Black & Decker customer service, but they were neither helpful nor sympathetic. Since we had a Black Decker mini oven that also died an early death, will not buy that brand again. They just don't make things as well as they used to."
2,you get what you pay for,"the chopper is super load when it's turned on. it does not really chop big pieces, you have to sort of manually chop them first to make the pieces small."
3,Black & Decker Electric Chopper,"This is not as fine as the old model that I used for years, but it will do for now"
2,"Quality issues, not unusual for B&D.","Motor on this product barely turns at first, makes awful noises, and then seems to ""loosen up"" after using it for a while. Had the same product previously and it worked great, so second one is obviously a lemon. However, 50/50 on product quality gets you a 1 in my book. When it works, it is a handy little chopper, especially since my wife likes to make everything from scratch and size and form factor are good. Buyer beware of quality."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to replace an older model because the plastic basket had gotten very worn. Unfortunatly this new one is more difficult to use because the plastic basket is very difficult to properly engage in the base. It seems that the plastic nubs that engage are just a bit too big, and every time I have to force it together I am afraid that I am going to crack the plastic basket.I loved the old model I had and that is why I replaced it with this one.I have been tempted to contact Black and Decker about this, but haven't so far."
1,Did not chop,I purchased this product in January and today had to chop some herbs for a receipe and guess what it did not chop Rosemary or Basil. I am really mad that it is to late to return!
3,"USeful small chopper, good price",It is easier to use this little chopper since I cook for one. The price is right and it does its job
5,Great little Chopper,"We originally got a similar one for a wedding present 21 years ago. This past Christmas, it died, and my wife was in the middle of crushing up nuts for cookies.We got this one because of the similar size of our old one. The power in this chopper is great! The blades are strong enough to basically handle anything you can throw at it (well, maybe not nuts and bolts...but food items!)Nice, small, and does what you need it to do. No need to pull out the big food processor, and put the blade that is needed into it. Just plug in, open up, pour your nuts (or tomatoes, or cukes, or whatever), close the lid, and hit the button. In a half second or so, it is chopped up nicely!!Plus, dishwasher safe is a winner in my corner. My fat fingers cannot reach into those small spaces to dry it!"
2,not big enough for an onion,"the small print says that the onion has to be in 3/4 in chunks to start. Well, that is not much help at all. Also comes with a little tab lock on the plug to ensure that you cannot return it as new even though it most certainly does not work for my needs. May work for salsa or herbs. Don't know yet, but this is certainly not what I wanted! Back to my big kitchen aid."
1,Useless,"I got this based on the many positive reviews here and I'm totally disappointed. It does not chop, a little bit of the peppers I experimented with turned to some unedible mush, the bulk just spins around in the bowl. Totally useless."
4,Good chopper though with limits,"This chopper works well with shrimp, tomato and other materials. But it cannot chop vegatables with much fiber. It cannot chop some hard materials like gristle. Also the machine is very hot after long time working. Anyway it is a qualified chopper in this price."
2,The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.,"The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than 1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one."
2,disappointed,"This compact chopper was a replacement for one that finally wore out after many years.This new chopper does not get the job done. I used it to chop onions/celery etc. for use in stuffings, eggs etc. It took way too long to get things chopped and even then they weren't chopped enough. It ran so long it felt like I would burn out the motor.Can not recommend."
2,Not as good as the original,The origial model 300HA was better because the blades were closer together and did a better job of quick chopping small quantities. This model is still worth while and a valuable addition to any food preparation area. Too bad you just cannot buy replacement blades..
4,Black and Decker mini-processor,"This is a great little kitchen helper. It saves your having to take out and wash up a large processor for smaller quantites to be chopped. I must say, however, that this newer version is not as well constructed as its predecessor!!!"
5,Perfect,"Even though it is small, it is quite handy. It works well and is perfect for a single person or small family."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I bought this chopper to replace a similar one that broke after 3 years of intense use and that worked very well. I've used the new one to chop carrots and the blade can't chop through the pieces of carrot, it ends up just spinning uselessly. I'm very disapointed that a Black&Decker product is of such poor quality. To the garbage bin it goes!"
1,"The worst chopper I have ever used, from the first use!","We had high expectations with this, based on other reviews.We make pesto for home use with our old one that was my grandmothers for we don't know how long. Grandmother's was a different brand too.Anyways. We opened it, put the stuff in to make a small batch of pesto and we had to trash that batch and the chopper started smoking, as if it were overloaded.It's bad if you need to chop anything more than water, and even then, I think it would be bad at it."
4,Hollywood is an ugle place with madmen stalking the halls,"The cry of the fishmongers is heard in the Hotel Earle.The New York playwright meets his deadlineon a wrestling picture...And heads roll, but we at the last wonderif the head that is rolling isn't the writer's?The plot is a bit dreamlike where the great American novelist is a drunkwhose secretary writes his scripts for himand the New York fellow keeps writing hissame literary play over and over in writer's block.Who is this ""burleyman"" he makes his leading characterin the screen play?Who escaped from the mental ward to writethis one?"
4,A Real Cast of Characters,"I really didn't know what to expect when I rented ""Barton Fink"" but it wasn't long before I found myself drawn into the movie. The plot has some unusual twists and turns but the thing I came away with was the characters that emerge from the film. John Goodman certainly was one of the top characters in the movie but also noteworthy are the Movie Mogul, the writer (a cross between, I believe, F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner), the secretary, all the way down to a couple of hard-boiled cops. I couldn't get enough of these zany personalities that create a circus of insanity around our otherwise stuffy ""hero"". It gets crazy at times but it works."
5,Great film that ran out of creativity at the end...,"Five Stars for the Superb actors, but the writers and directors get Two Stars because they ran out of creativity and ideas at the end of the film...threw in some gratuitous murders and violence...so they could finallyend the movie...sad and disappointing for the Coen family film team..."
4,Barton Fink delivers twisted thoughts,"John Tuturro is a writer who moves to LA on a deal with a movie business, who suffers from writers block and starts to go insane. John Goodman consoles him becomes his friend, but he turns out to be a madman who kills a lot of people. Both Turturo and Goodman are terrific and this movie will take you an a twisted look at insanity."
1,Worst Cohen brothers film by far,"I'm a big fan of the Cohen brothers as well as John Goodman and Jon Turturo, but I did not enjoy this film. They wrote the film while they had writer's block during the creation of Miller's Crossing and it shows. The plot is incredibly flat and slow. The climax with John Goodman is completely predictable and that makes for a boring ending to an incredibly boring film."
1,Don't Bother with This One,"Barton Fink is a poorly written and directed film. It is a string of random clichés with some bad language and a little violence thrown into the mix and little more. Calling this a movie is an insult to the real movies out there.My advice is save your money and buy almost anything else. A more descriptive title would be ""Rotten Stink"" John Goodman is a fine actor and this is the worst film I have ever seen him associated with. I am also a fan of the Coen Brothers, but this is just a bad movie.The movie has no action, it is not funny, it is not romantic, it is not intellectual, it has no plot and it just sort of flops around on the screen like a fish out of water."
1,This movie stinks.,This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Do not watch it. Save two hours of your life. Trust me.
1,Don't watch this movie!,"This movie is total Bull! anybody who claims to like it, is probably faking it. The people who appreciate this movie, are probably like those who go to an Art Exhibition and appreciate Picaso's paintings, even though they know that the paintings are total Bull! hahathe other movies of Coen Brothers rock! but this movie is total bull!I hope nobody goes thru the same pain I did while watching this movie.Bottom line: This movie has no story! really! so, if you wanna spend time watching a good movie, then this movie is NOT for you!"
3,Interesting but flawed,"Barton Fink works quite well on two different levels. On the surface, it is the story of a playwright gone to Hollywood to sell out only to suffer writers block under the weight of producing bad material. Underneath the surface is a political parable about the 30s and 40s left wing intelligentsia being so wrapped up in idealism and abstraction as to not notice the rise of Nazism right next to them. The film works on both levels, but it also suffers from some rather slow spots and a main character who is often insufferable. Barton Fink never fails to hold interest, and is occassionally riveting, but falls short of being a superior movie."
3,They did improve.,"I enjoy Coen brothers' movies... usually. This was an exception. I'm happy it was not the first of their movies I viewed, or it might have been the last. It had its moments, but overall it just wasn't worth the time."
5,Writing is a Hell of an occupation,"A brilliant movie: comedy, tragedy, horror, satire, allegory all wrapped up in a hatbox-sized package. So much for the Artist going to Hell and back for his Masterpiece...."
4,That barton fink feeling.,"The film gets five stars. The VHS tape gets three stars. So it evens out at a solid four star rating.Barton Fink is quite possibly the Coen brothers strangest film. Their most symbolic, perhaps. I dunno- its a great ride and you need to take it. John Turturro and John Goodman give fantastic performances. Without Goodman's character, or performance, this movie would have been dangerously slow and low-key.And the VHS. Its pan and scan, hence the three stars. Still waiting for this and Miller's Crossing to come out on DVD, maybe with a few extras even. But I'm not holding my breath."
5,"Quite amusing, but with some dark twists","This Coen Bros production is typically off-beat. While a young John Turturo comes off well as the blocked playwrite trying to come up with a movie script, it was the comic turns by the Hollywood studio boss and the overwrought producer that really steal this show. They are very funny. John Goodman as the psycho neighbor plays himself, as usual. The two Hollywood detectives are pretty funny, too. Overall, this is an entertaining piece of artistry."
5,Excellent Quality - Affordable Price - Quick Shippping,This movie far exceeded my expectations. Only the Coen brothers to produce such a master piece. Entirely entertaining - This it a movie that I'm proud to add to my collection.
5,A Beautiful and Thought Provoking Picture,"This is one of the best Coen brothers films (they're all great, but this one is REALLY great). The ending is a little confusing the first time you watch it (what's in the box, et cetera) but if you watch it again and give it some thought, the message is simple. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!"
5,Most influential movie of our time,"There are many movies on the market that make a statement, this makes one of the most powerful statements in film. In the classic Coen tradition the dark motif of the film is underscored by layers upon layers of symbolism. This is a film that has recieved none of the recognition it deserves. I recommend that it be in every household. John Goodman provides a brilliant depiction of the devil (or so I believe). Barton Fink is the by far one of the Coen boys best putting it far above and beyond the feild of modern film."
2,what the heck did I just watch (spoiler alert),"What was in the box?How did he take off the handcuffs?Was John Goodman real? or is this like the fight club thing?Why was the fire accommodating him,is John Goodman the devil?Why did the last scene look like the picture in his room?Who killed the girl?What the heck did I just watch.I'm not going to pretend I understood this movie just to sound smart or cool. I didn't understand it, it was boring and that is my opinion."
5,Cohen Brother's Early Masterpiece,"If you are a fan of period dramas with meticulously crafted dialogue you must watch this film. Gabriel Byrne is the shizz and John Turturo shines in this as a wannabe thug. The gunplay, fights and music are all top of the mark. Will leave you wanting more."
1,the rating is for the dvd,"barton fink is one of my favorite movies. i flip-flop between the big lebowski and barton fink as my favorite coen brothers movie. however, this dvd could have come with more extras. we've waited a long time for its release.the 8 ""deleted scenes"" are the same familiar scenes from the film with the odd line re-inserted here and there. it adds up to maybe 30 seconds of new stuff and if you have the coen brothers screenplays vol 1. it won't be new to you at all.where's the commentary? come on coens, you did a commentary for ""the man who wasn't there"". this movie won the palm d'or for pete's sake. isn't there some cannes footage you could have stuck on here at least? or have the cast revisit their work in a new interview?i bought the movie anyway, and it's not a bad price for what you get, but i'd have paid more for more."
5,Makes the Sopranos look like big ...,"(Refers to the vhs). The late Mario Puzo's the Last Don is a fine example of the ""mob"" drama, with fine acting throughout; including two of my favorite actors, Danny Aiello and Joe Montegna, last seen as Justice Novelli on the short-lived First Monday (i.e., Montegna). The feature length version I have has material not included in the other version. I look forward to seeing Part II, which I also have. In the tradition of The Godfather, a fairly good example of La Cosa Nostra (Our Thing).See it."
2,Just a soap opera. Mario's great works are past.,For me the movie seemed like a soap opera and was very disappointing. Perhaps because I had seen the earlier Godfather series my expectations were too high. In every way this movie is inferior.
5,Well done,"What else would you expect from an amazing story. I watched the mini-series and i absolutely loved it , then i was hoping for the movie to come out.My prayers were ansewered later and am i glad they ever did. The movie is just as captivating as the book or the series, but the problem was that some interesting parts concerning the development of the main characters that were shown in the mini series, but not the movie. Overall this is the best movie ever edited into a videotape coming from a 6 episode series. It should have been in theatres. Well done."
2,The Godfather it isn't....,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid...was a television min-series type deal. If you really like mafia movies, this one is adequate, but not spectacular. The characters come off almost goofy at times, and the acting is a bit over dramatic. It's certainly not close to Godfather quality...but taken for what it is, I've definitely seen worse movies too."
3,"Mafia Drama, good in its own right","I believe that, for a smaller production ( ie less expensive ) this is actually a Great movie. However, it doesnt compare to Godfather for example. Still I almost loved this film. But I believe that This movie , unlike other gangster movies, could have a bit more of cruelty and extreme violence ( who saw Casino and Goodfellas know what I am talking about ) which are an indispensable *sauce* for any gangsta movs. still a good Mafia production, alutought, not 5 stars ( Id actually rate it 3 and a half stars if it was possible )."
2,dissapointing,"The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first 10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors."
4,The last don rewiev,"I bought some time ago both The Last Don I and II, and I saw them. They are a great serie from Mario Puzo. I recomend you these complete serie."
4,one of mario puzo's finest.,"this is a great mob story,it shows almost every angle and position in a mafia-""family"".danny aiello was terrific and jason gedric did very well and should be considered in some future mob movies with most experienced mob actors getting older.i appreciated how it told story of a full decade.(also,the book is well worth reading)R.I.P. MARIO PUZO"
3,I've got space for this,"Kept in suspense every minute. Danny Aiello finally displays his finer talent as the Don. Has the required skill. Kirsty Alley portrays dreadful hate and darkness toward the Don, the Clericuzio. Jason Gedrick, innocent from the start, a given for the future. Serious family business headed toward the flame. Ruthless to the point, perhaps wiser.Never cross the Don. Ever."
5,ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING,"I really wasn't too interested in the mafia...but after watching the whole Last Don series, I really got it to it. These movies are very well written and acted. Jason Gedrick and Danny Aiello are wonderful. I give thes movies 10 stars!"
2,"Mediocre drama, poor love story, does not reach potential.","This movie is a disappointment, stick to earlier works by these artists. Danny not used much, mostly as a narrator, no character delineation. Main characters are young kids growing up in the mafia."
2,WELL ACTED,"THIS POWERFUL MOVIE WAS WELL ACTED BUT, IT HAD A VAGUE PLOT AND TERRIBLE SCRIPTS, I DO RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE THOUGH"
2,Little dissapointment,"I bought this book to learn and understand the mechanics that lay behind bridge monevents, especially Howell movement. Namely, tables for Howell movement can be found everywhere on the Net, but how to create a Howell table is not such a trivial job. The book dissapoint me in this, for it explains movement on the level of using ready-to-use cards.Second big dissapointment is graphical design of the book. Graphics in the book are hand-made, tables are copied in poorely quality. It was understandeable for the first edition, dated in 1967, but second edition, the one from 1993, had to be graphically revised, too.To resume, if yoe are looking for simple guide to help you to comprehend bridge tournaments, to use ready-to-use tables for movements, you could consider to use this book. On the other side, if you want to understand the movements, you will be dissapinted with this book."
5,Golden Hits Indeed!,I was first introduced to Sarah Vaughan from a compilation jazz cd from the Verve label. The song was Misty and since I haven't heard anyone sing that song any better than Vaughan. This cd contains most of her greatest hits but indeed she's song countless more. A few songs are okay but the majority are truly golden!
3,Decent book.,"This book has lots of interesting information. The author has done his homework. However, it gets boring at times and also the entire first 1/3 of the book just assumes that you believe in the theory of evolution."
3,"Early polar exploration, with a British point of view","Safe Return Doubtful is a very interesting and well-written book, but suffers from the common disease of polar writing: glorification of suffering. The British being the true pioneers in the field of needless suffering, the book naturally emphasizes the British view of the polar expeditions. As a consequence, Amundsen is villified and Scott glorified, for example. Strangely, the book doesn't discuss the greatest, most heroic, polar expedition-Shackleton's attempt to cross Antarctica.All in all, this is a worthwhile read if you are a polar exploration buff."
2,Ug...!...,"This is a pointless game with very little story. Not very hard but with very VERY limited controls it make shooting the path in front of you even impossible. Not my idea of a good game, try somethin' else."
2,Classic was better,"This game gets old quick. Despite the list of weapons listed on the box, you really only use 1 (the heatseeking missles). This game as a whole lacks any options for jazzing up gameplay, and it's pretty easy to beat! The only good thing was you can unlock the '83 classic game and play it! You might consider renting this game, but there's no need to spend money on it!"
1,Dont bother,"Of the 15 or so games I own for the X-box this is the only one I think is a total loss. This game held my interest for all of about 5 minutes. And the ""Multiplayer"" games that you have to first unlock by beating tracks in single player mode are a complete joke. Dont waste your hard earned money on this one."
2,Not as fun as arcade original,This game is short and has glitchy graphics that slow down and freeze up all the time. The game itself is pretty good but is way to short. I beat it in 1 afternoon. The xbox version comes with the original also. I played that longer than the actual game. This game is good for renting if you want a night of gaming but way to short to buy.
5,I Don't Know Why People Say This Movie is Bad,This movie is not bad. It's actually very good. One person on the reveiw list gave it one star. This movie is good enough for five. The movie is well down. Sean Penn has made a very good movie. Jack Nicholson was very good in it. The movie has great music and a very good ending. Don't listen to whoever says it's a bad movie. They just don't know a good movie when they see it.
2,Not for the average movie-goer,"I was sadly disappointed by this film. There's an amazing amount of talent that was involved in it, and I had very different expectations. I admit, I'm a sucker for Hollywood endings and neatly packaged films. However, I also like movies that explore characters rather than follow a strong plotline.This film was a character study. The serial killer plot was really secondary to the psychological exploration of Jack Nicholson's character. However, as is a real danger with this type of movie, I found it to be excruciatingly slow and unsatisfying. Penn teases you repeatedly, making you believe that there will be a conclusion, that the killer will be caught (or at least, will kill again), then never satisfies you. By the time the movie ended, I was frustrated and saddened. If you're just looking for a two hour escape from life, you probably won't enjoy this film.."
3,NICHOLSON DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!,"Jack Nicholson is, to me, one of the best actors of this generation, and his acting in this movie was typical Nicholson. Powerful!Although the movie was electric and spell binding, it left far too big a question at the end. This may work for some movies. For this one, it did not.I did not like the ending."
5,Excellent! I want to give it 10 stars,"A study into the depths of madness. Jack Nicholson delivers the performance of a lifetime as an obsessed cop who will do anything to catch the killer.Does this film move at a slower pace? Yes. But it is extremely thought provoking and the ending leaves you stunned and mesmorized.For those that do not like movies that make you think, I'm sure you can watch the mindless, dull and unoriginal spectacle that is the Lord of the Rings instead."
2,BORING!!,This movie is quite boring as for most of the movie he is watching his back and and getting freaked out. Nothing really happens until there is about 15 minutes left. The storyline is somewhat good but there should be something happening for the first hour and a half.
1,dull and pointless,"This movie starts off like a mystery/thriller, but quickly becomes a slow-moving and ultimately unsatisfying attempt at a character study. Do not watch it expecting to see a cop movie, or anything other than nicholson playing drunk."
2,Disturbing,"I liked this movie up to the point that I realized that he was using the girlfriend's daughter as bait for a serial child murderer. After hearing about all the horrors that happen to children today, I didn't need this."
1,"very, very, very bad!!","First, I never write reviews! However, I must warn you DON'T BUY, RENT OR OTHERWISE SPEND MONETARY UNITS ON THIS MOVIE!! Despite all the previous reviews, this is the most accurate because I'm a professional couch potato. Now that I've just finished wasting MY time with this movie, let me save you what seems to be days of horrible film footage. Honestly, giving 1 star to this movie is just too generous. Anyway, choose as you will, but realize you've been warned!!"
2,So mad,"My boyfriend and I couldn't believe it. At the end of the movie we just wanted to call Sean Pean and ask him how he could do this to us! What a let down. I can't believe we will never know who the killer is. After all that suspense. What were they thinking. Even though we enjoyed the movie while we were watching it, the end was such a let down that it's not worth it. Jack is great though..."
1,THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL...,"I THOUGHT IT STUNK. I THOUGHT WITH JACK NICHOLSON IN IT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MOVIE. SEAN PENN HAS DIRECTED BETTER. THERE REALLY IS NOT MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN THAT.JACK NICHOLSON'S CHACTER COMES ACROSS AS A DIRTY OLD MAN, AND A CHILD PERVERT. THE MOVIE DRAGS ON AND ON. YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER TIME WATCHING THE SQUIRRELS RUN AROUND IN YOUR BACKYARD."
3,Decent,"I would just like to say that this movie was not all bad, but it could have been a lot better. It ran quite slow, but it was nicely acted, written, and directed. The ending was OK, but I was suspecting one to be a lot better, and it left me with a feeling of ""is that it??"". I found some scenes quite annoying like the questioning of Benecio del Toro. In short it was alright but definetly not a keeper."
5,"Great film, unorthodox yet entrancing","Its easy to get wrapped up in this film. Its classic film noir, unorthodox, grim, yet completely satisfying. Penn did an excellent job, and nicholson givesa magnificently understated performance. If you appreciate realism, psychological interplay, and plots that stray from the norm, then check this film out. However, if you are intent on watching a movie that wraps up everything into a tidy superficial package, then stay away. Not your typical hollow-wood pulp."
2,Not one of Nicholson's better movies,The Pledge had some moments to it but really could not stay focused on the film for some reason. Got a little lost in the middle of it and did not take much away from it which almost never happens in any Jack Nicholson movie I had seen. The plot seemed to be interesting at first but could not follow the movie well. Maybe for the die hard Nicholson fan but otherwise didn't think was one of his better performances.Peter J. Miller
3,NICE TWIST AT THE END,"This movie was nominated for several awards but didn't win the prize for them. It's based on a novella by Swiss author Friedrich Durrenmatt, focusing upon a man whose paranoia drives him slowly into madness. It's disjointed at times and I found out that it seems to focus on the subplot more of the novella than the actual tale. Maybe that's why it didn't feel right to me. That said, it has a nice twist to it and doesn't follow the typical parameter of its genre which is refreshing. STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; PAYOFF: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B minus."
2,Unsatisfactory,"Nicholson's mannered portrayal of a man in a leather flying helmet polishing furniture was practically telephoned in. Penn seems to have fallen prey to a fundamental misunderstanding in his direction of Nicholson's character development - that was Mr Sheen, not Pledge.The disappointment was ameliorated somewhat by the trailer for Penn's next film - a CGI animation for all the family inspired by the lady in the Shake n' Vac commercial."
1,Avoid this movie,"I thought when I was going to the theater to see this,I said hey it has Jack Nicholson in it,how bad could it be?Well,it was really bad,and really long and boring.Jack Nicholson is usually a pretty good actor,but not this time."
1,The worst Jack Nicholson film ever made!!,"Man, what was I thinking when I saw this movie?! I mean, from the previews and such, I thought that ""The Pledge"" was going to be a really good movie. But now, when I saw it on DVD, I began to question myself as to why Jack Nicholson even bothered to make this movie. I haven't seen Nicholson ever since ""As Good As It Gets"" and really, I just have to say, ""Why, Jack?!"" I've seen better Jack Nicholson movies than this, such as ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Batman"", ""Wolf"", and ""The Crossing Guard"". But ""The Pledge"" has to be among the worst ones. And I really don't know what to say about Sean Penn's directing in this film right now. In conclusion, this movie may be great for renting, but it is not great to own, whether it's on video or DVD! And by the way, ""The Pledge""? Looks more like ""The Plunge"" if you ask me."
1,Seen the trailer? Don't get your hopes up!,"This movie was quite the let down. I'm not just talking about the ending here either. It starts with a good premise, then drags on at length with a less than entertaining story of an old man.Don't get me wrong, it's well acted. The fact that the ending was disappointing isn't all that bad either. It's more the fact that you get slowly dragged along, waiting for the interesting/exciting part. Afterwards you're left to think about the film and reflect on what little went on. Some people turn that into ""boy this movie is great because it's different from other movies."" Originality doesn't mean entertainment though. The ""lesson"" it leaves you with is not very powerful or thought provoking. You'll come out feeling a little sad, and that's about it."
1,I should sue for my time back,"I can not overstate how much I disliked this film. Despite what appeared to be an all star cast, the plot and dialogue of this film is depressing and pointless. It is one thing to be melancholy when there is a point to be made or human aspect worth exploring. The sole purpose of this film, however, appears to be the infliction of the writer and director's morose outlook on the human condition.The plot of the film takes forever to develop, then goes nowhere. The characters are not at all engaging, and the filmaking is a disjointed mess.I would not recommend this film to anyone. It has no redemming value whatsoever. I should sue the film company for the 2 hours they stole from my life, I want that time back."
1,Everyone Smokes In Hell,"The Pledge is an overly long and overly slow film that demonstrates that Sean Penn is no better in front of a camera or behind it. The writers do their best to add a twist to the overly predictable ending. The film is also a two hour long ad for the cigarette companies. Almost everyone smokes and they smoke constantly while awake. But, ""everyone smokes in hell."" Jack Nicholson gives a good performance and is the only cement that holds this film together. There are lots of cameo appearances from big name celebrities. These appearances do nothing for this film other than add some well known names to the DVD box in hopes that you buy it due to ""star power."" We purchased The Pledge as a part of a two-for deal with The Departed. The later is a fairly good film by Leonardo DiCaprio, the former by Sean Penn is a flop."
4,"Huh, interesting",I know many people were ticked off by the ending of this movie but MY GOD at least it was something DIFFERENT. Not the usual ending for this type of film.The film was well acted and suspenseful. Great small guest parts and Nicholson was great. You think you're going to get a Hollywood ending and you don't. What's wrong with that? Check it out.P.S. TOTALLY heartbreaking if you are a parent.
4,A different type police story,"In some respects this would fall in the police procedural genre, but it is a different type story. Nicholson plays the role of a retired police officer who has made a pledge to track down the killer of a young girl. The way he does that takes up most of the motion picture. It is a psychological drama as he deals with his obsession. You realize what he is doing, while the people around him do not. His obsession eventually destroys friendships. The story takes a major twist at the end, and you somehow feel that he has been left hanging.It is not the type story that appeals to everyone, but it is a solid performance by Nicholson who carries most of the story."
4,Cheers to Penn and Nicholson!!,"Best buddies Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson show what decent work they can turn out when Penn is in the director's chair and Nicholson is on the screen in all his splendor. The film is sluggish at times and the feel of the whole thing is nothing cheerful, but the performances alone make it worthwhile. American audiences have come to expect happy endings in their movies, which is why this one didn't fare too well at the box office. In any event, highly recommended."
5,A Nicholson tour de force!,"I can't say enough about Nicholson and his acting. He plays a cop in such a way to make you believe that that's what he was always supposed to be. One has to wonder how he totally immerses himself as he does.This was my first Sean Penn movie, and while his style does take getting used to, it's worth it. He builds suspense in much the same way Hitchcock did. There were a few scenes I could have done without, but over all it showed a master's touch.Don't buy this movie unless you're ready for an intense, involving experience."
2,Depressing...,"I have said it before, and I am saying it again I DON'T LIKE MOVIES THAT MAKE ME DEPRESSED! (real life is depressing enough!) The only good thing about this movie was the acting, and the basic plot concept. Benicio Del Toro was in this movie for all of 5 minutes (so don't see this just for him). The first scene of the movie shows you exactly how it is going to end, yet I was stupid enough to sit through it anyhow. Good concept, Great acting, VERY Bad Movie"
1,Bad Movie,"Typical excellent acting by Nicholson, but the movie was SLOW, poorly organized and had nothing besides Nicholson. The ending was very poorly done."
1,Stinker!,"This movie was a waste of money. It had big name actors and a good plot, they should have done more with it. My advice is: don't bother."
5,one of the 10 best films of the year,i bought THE PLEDGE on dvd a few weeks ago. I didnt enjoy it the first time i watched it. The second time i watched the film i liked a whole bunch. I guess its a real good movie if it is a lot bettter the 2nd time around.i was excpecting a lot more action in it but i didnt get very much. All we get to see is a dreary suicide. We get to see a lot of stars in brief roles in this picture. Look for veteran actor HARRY DEAN STNTON as the guy who JACK NICHOLSON buys the gas station from.I thought that the film had a certain unique feature about it. Maybe i just like movies about cops. That could be it. The certain twist at the end of the film puts a grin on your face and meks you think jack nicholson went crazy. i sure thought he did. I highly recomend this movie. You will enjoy this more if you like police movies.
2,For the film school set. Pointless.,"Not only is this drawn out and frankly, boring (despite a fabulous cast) the end literally cheats you out of even the slightest satisfaction. Be prepared to fast forward."
2,Very Disappointing!!!,"I can't believe how this movie started out fairly interesting and plunged into a downward spiral from there!! What a waste! I can't believe so many people like it, as well as they did. For those who haven't yet seen this movie -- beware of the totally dud ending!!"
1,Just bad,"Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance in this slow plodding movie.Jack clearly made this movie as a favor to his friend Sean Penn.Penn should stick to acting.The cut aways the distracting music,very disapointed."
1,I sat in the theater thinking of 100 other things to do!,"Okay first the whole reason why I went to see this movie was because I am a BIG fan the director and some of the actors in the film. BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I EVER SAW AT THE SHOW! If you like Sean Penn like I do then rent Carlito's Way or The Game; If you like Jack Nicholson (and who doesn't) then rent The Shining, Hoffa, and A Few Good Men; Finally if you like Benicio Del Torro I have to go with Way of The Gun, or the Usual Suspects...I was soooooooooooo disappointed with this movie, I am really trying to refrain from usual foul language to really describe how I felt as I left the theater! I can only compare watching this film to being forced to sit in a classroom with someone raking their nails on the blackboard! This was probably a much better book then a movie. One question why the hell is this on DVD and Hoffa isn't????"
1,The Pledge,"I didn't like this movie at all. At first, I was captivated by where the story seemed to be going, but the ending was so, and the only way I could voice is, dumb. Its as if the movie director wanted to put in a different sort of ending, instead of the usual crime is solved, killer caught. I found the ending a big let down. It would have been a great movie..."
1,One of the worst movies of all time,"Please don't waste your time with this movie. The only people who like it are the ""artsy"" types who will like it simply because the unwashed masses hated it (we don't understand ""art"")."
5,Thought-provoking,"Not many movies have me thinking about them days after viewing. The Pledge did that for me. There are so many questions left unanswered, so many what if's...The significance of The Pledge may easily be lost while watching the story unfold. It's only at the end you are reminded again of what The Pledge means.Truly a great conversation starter."
2,Spend your time elsewhere.,"Although it is a well acted and well filmed film. I found it pointless. If you like sad tragic endings then buy this, otherwise buy something else."
5,A must see!,"This movie is a delight all the way through: Good acting, good, slow-but-deliberate pacing, undestandable motivations, unpredicatable plot.The end is incredible, both from an acting point of view, and from the view that it fits so perfectly with the rest of the movie, but is so unexpected from a Hollywood film.I was thinking about the film for days...Bottom line: The film would be best described with the phrases dark, slow paced, actor's showcase, good dialogue, unconventional ending. If that describes your kind of film, see this, 5 stars. If not, stay away.dap"
2,Good movie until the end,"This is a good movie and it is an interesting story and it flows well from the beginning. It isn't predictable at all which is always good also. I was enjoying the movie until it got to the end. I understood the ending, I got what they were telling me but all I can say is it was stupid!!! The end of the movie wastes the rest of the movie for me. Until the end the movie was probably a 4 for me, the ending was a 0 so I gave it a 2. I wouldn't watch this movie again and I don't recommend it for others."
2,Dreary,"The critics thought this was Jack's best pic, but I thought it ""bit the big one"". Jack Nicholson has more talent than this. It did not do him justice. I LOVE Jack Nicholson, but hated this movie. I didn't think there was a JN movie I would dislike, but here it is."
3,The Pledge is Unoriginal,"While Jack Nicholson supplies a good performance, Sean Penn's directorial debut is anything but original. The screenplay is almost identical to a little-known 1994 British production of ""In the Cold Light of Day,"" wherein Richard E. Grant plays the role of the protagonist detective with even more intensity than Jack Nicholson. The Pledge's screenplay appears to have a few plot elements altered in order to distinguish itself from ""In the Cold Light of Day;"" however, these changes merely add to story-line non sequiturs. My advice: buy the British version of this story ""In the Cold Light of Day"" which is also available through Amazon."
2,Falls Well Short of Promise,"While the cast of characters, setting and storyline all indicate a fair amount of promise for this movie- it is hurriedly directed. The rush to plot resolution leaves critical pieces of the storyline like Nicholson's decent into insanity and his increasing manipulation of mother and daughter hanging out as disjointed scenes. Without the development of Nicholson's character the sequence of events that lead up to the movie's end make it difficult to suspend disbelief. Very disappointing."
2,What happened?,"If you want to watch a film that's fairly decent all the way until the end, this is a good choice.At the end I felt like I'd wasted the entire time I'd spent watching it, which, obviously, isn't a good impression to have lingering at the end of watching a movie.I highly recommend renting this one first, I can't possibily imagine seeing this one twice."
1,"1 or 1.5, WHO CARES?","This movie was a big disappointment, and a waste of time. I was pulled into the plot at the beginning because it was fast paced, and suspenseful, but as the movie progressed, I was really starting to get bored. After the ending (Which was really strange and very unsatisfactory), I was kind of mad, at having wasted a perfectly good weekend with my friends watching this. I suggest you definitely rent this one before even thinking of buying it."
3,"I ""Pledge"" to avoid this.","The movie starts out very nicely. You get a clear since of direction from all the characters. Jack is Jack. Different kind of role, but he does it nicely. As the plot gets deeper, and the story becomes more twisted, you are waiting for the climax, or release from the story. A resolution so to speak, but I don't feel it ever happens. I think it was a very strange way to end the film. I will say that the movie does leave you in constant anticipation of ""something's about to happen."" That part of the movie I liked"
5,"beautiful art and a cute, clever story","Auntie Claus is an original take on the goings-on at the North Pole each year. Not only do we find out about Santa Claus, but we find out about his whole family and what they do during the rest of year. The story is cute and funny and the illustrations are beautiful and set the tone for the book. The contrast between New York City and the North Pole is wonderful - in both the story and the pictures.My children loved the book and were on the edge of their seats waiting to see what would next happen to Sophie at each step of the story. Ms. Primavera has really captured the feeling of what it's like to be a child and my children felt like they were at the North Pole with Sophie going through her adventure."
4,An Enjoyable Book,"This is definitely an enjoyable book, but I agree with a previous reviewer. It's definitely missing something.While this book teaches children that it is better than to receive it doesn't do much else. We know certain things about Auntie Claus and her niece and nephew, but not enough. I think a lot more could have been added to this book, but wasn't out of a rush from the publisher.If you are looking for a book with beautiful illustrations this is for you, if you are looking for a great story, keep searching."
2,Not a favorite,I read this to my 7 year old and she was having trouble following the story. Just very choppy and a strange story. She didn't even want me to finish it. Not very well written at all.
2,way too dark and creepy for our 6-7 year old daughter,"This was disturbing to my very bright daughter when she was 6-7. She asked me to get rid of it, which she never asks me to do. Auntie Claus is very strange and more than a little creepy. The pictures are gorgeous, but the story just didn't make a lot of sense. Another writer said that better, but then we dumped the book several years ago. However, the author is great and my daughter is now 10 and she adores this author's Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls."
2,I'll Pass On This One,"Cute premise, but...this book just doesn't do it for me. I have been holding this book in my Amazon cart for a few weeks, waiting until I placed a large Christmas order. I'm glad I read short bits of this book in the bookstore before ordering it. The storyline is not entertaining in my opinion. Also, holidays such as Valentine's Day and Halloween are mentioned. My family and I do not celebrate Halloween, so this is another downfall of the book."
5,Great Christmas Story,"This book is a really good story. I like it because it is a really happy story about Sophie's aunt who she thinks is Santa Claus' sister. Sophie stoys away in one of her aunt's suitcases to discover that she arrives in the North Pole and is mistaken for an elf. The story is a great example that giving is better than receiving. Sophie learns that she likes herself better when she gives.I would recommend this book to any child 5+ - it has great pictures, creative story, and likable characters. I want to read the sequel."
1,"Delightful drawings, poor plot","Seeing mixed reviews, I read this book in the bookstore and I was glad I didn't order it. The plot is very weak and the morale of the story is a stretch. The story never shows or describes why it is better to give. It just throws the morale out in the end. Too bad. Because the drawings are delightful."
5,A Christmas Treasure!,"As a First Grade teacher, I found this book to be one of those that I will look forward to reading over and over again with my students. The artwork is stunning, and the story truly captures a child's imagination. It is a wonderful story about remembering what is really important during the holidays. My students can't wait for me to read it again!"
3,average,"the books were as promisedthe delivery technically was within the deadlines promised, but when you pay for ""expedited"" delivery, you expect it soon not at the very end of a deadline; upon follow up, i learned that it did not SHIP as quickly as it should have; the delivery time was normal"
3,"Vivid, lively, unique illustrations.","A nice oversize book, good for reading aloud and showing the pictures to the kids as you go along. These pictures are gorgeous and exciting. But what am I missing here? The story is odd -- it seems to be missing a lot of pages. We know almost nothing about the aunt herself -- what is she like and what does she do, esp. between Christmas and Valentine's Day? It's a wonderful premise, and would make a good animated film, but somebody would have to do a lot of work developing a much more complete storyline. So many things are never explained -- even things in the pictures. For example, what is the smoking thing she's holding on the cover? I did like the ""salvation"" of Sophie, though. So don't pass it up, because the pictures are just glorious."
1,MLB 2006: The Show should be cancelled!,"I was quite upset to hear that there would not be an MVP Baseball 2006 and after buyign and playing MLB 2006: The Show I was even more upset. This game is a joke compared to the MVP series. The fielding is horrible, trying to run the bases is impossible, and the absence of the throwing meter on outifeld and infield throws just plain stinks. The graphics are great, the music is good but the gameplay is horrible. Compared to MVP Baseball this game would be like going from PS2 back to Atari!"
2,"""Average Game""","Pros: 1. Copied many concepts from MVP 2005 such as hot/cold zones, pitching meter, anologue stick power.2. ESPN like replay quality with the two teams playing each other shown.3. Good broadcasting.Cons: 1. A clone copy of the two other games from LAST YEAR.2. Poor Graphics.3. Limited announcing phrases.4. Wasn't having nearly as much fun as with usual video games.Overall: This game had more negatives than positives. I liked last years version better."
1,The worst baseball game ever!!!!!!!!,"This game is horrible!!! I played it at Best Buy and it sucked so bad I couldn't play it for that long!!! The graphics are horrible, I mean the players don't look good!!! It looks like they have generic faces!!! The graphics are nowhere near Major League Baseball 2k5 or MVP 2004 or 2005!!! The gameplay is the worst I have ever seen in a baseball game!!! Don't buy this game!! Wait until MLB 2k6 comes out!! It already looks like it has alot better graphics and gameplay, plus it has the World Baseball Classic!!!"
4,Very solid game,"I could go on and on about all the good things this game has, but I will just list a few problems that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.1) There are no bloop base hits, everything to the outfield is either a line drive or a can-o-corn fly out.2) Diving is pretty much useless, the player seems to flop on the ground rather than extend at all.3) Not a lot of in-game injuries, they only seem to occur when you simulate a season game.4) Sometimes it's too easy to throw a strike when you have to, even when a pitcher is tired and wild, you can usually get it over the plate w/ 3 ball counts.Overall, this is a great baseball game though. Very realistic statistics and the computer can play you tough and actually strike you out. Nothing is too easy or too difficult."
5,MLB 06: The Show,"MLB 06: The Show is by far the best baseball video game ever made!!! The graphics rock and there are so many new features. I would personally recommend this game to anyone! My favorite mode is Career Mode, in which you create a player go through the minor leagues in hopes of one day making it to the show.*****5 Stars*****"
2,"Little data, lots of space, only good to hit batters","When I was told I could have this game I was pumped. When I loaded the game and saved my data, it took 3000 kb for rosters, profile, and dynasty. That and it was hard to play without setting everything good and taking about 750 kb. The only way to set the ball in the strike zone is to try and pitch it high. My way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens. Hitting was fairly easy, and playing on easy, I was losing 19-1 in the 3rd. My favorite part of the game is to......... hit batters with fastballs. So overall, 2 over 5."
2,coaster,"everytime a game system seems to become outdated for the next bigger and better version, the companies seem to dump games like this on us,if you liked MVP baseball by EA sports previous efforts you will definately not like this release from SONY, and please don't anybody say the graphics are better because they are not..........i just bought a forty dollar coaster...mmmphh"
1,The worst baseball game i own.,"If i could give this game a lower rating i would. This game is the worst basball game I own. The graphics are average at best, but i dont buy a game for graphics. This game plays horribly. If you have ever played a version of EA sports mvp baseball you should avoiod this game like the plague. Its hard to hit, hard field, and the overall game play is just plain terrible. Go buy a text game before you buy this, it will be more fun. Not to mention it locks up from time to time. Save your money and buy a pizza or something for dinner, you will get more enjoyment out of it"
4,Flashback,"It is so awesome to play this game again. It's one of the all time best shooters, and will probably remain that way. The only problem is getting used to the controls again. I'm too used to having two analog sticks, and 14 buttons to press for shooters now. The only real hang up I had with the controls was straffing with the L and R buttons. Other than that it plays wonderful, and the old graphics still hold up. A great way to remember being a teenager. I'd say this is a must have for any fans of shooters."
4,More carnage,"If you are a lawsuit happy whacko stay away from this one. It's not for the family, unless you happen to be in the Manson family! This game is a one player, 1st person shooter. There is a cable link option and if you are lucky enough to have two TVs, two game consols and two game CDs then you can have some real battles (same goes for the original DOOM)as you blast your way through violent, disguised communists or declare war on your playing partner. There are several levels and most get a little tougher as you finish each level. The music can be turned off to make the setting even more realistic. Lots of suprises and weapons keep this body count classic fresh. Nothing like a point blank double barrel shotgun blast to the face to really make you mad! A great deal at this price for sure."
4,Final Doom - PS1,"Final Doom is an excellent game. I own both Ultimate Doom & Final Doom for the playstation and enjoy playing both of them. This game is a lot more exhausting than Ultimate Doom, too. Most of the levels are huge, extremely mazy, and difficult, so you'd better be a good thinker! That's right, each level is a dark, scary labyrinth of evil soldiers & monsters, so you'll need to use your brain if you plan to make it out alive. The whole key to Doom is survival, and it's not going to be easy this time. The graphics are a bit sluggish, which is why I give the game 4 stars instead of 5. But everything else (sound fx, music, controls, gameplay factor) is fine. The soundtrack in this game is very disturbing, to say the least. It helps create an incredibly eerie atmosphere that few games have ever done. The sound fx are realistic and the gameplay factor is superb.Do I recommend Final Doom for PS1? Yes, I do. So order it now while supplies last, or be ""doomed"" forever!"
5,Awesome!!,"I finally got a copy of this game on Saturday- Since I played my first doom game on a computer over 10 years ago, I've been hooked ever since. I got slaugtered a few times during the first level, so I had to cheat and get all weapons-For now, it's the only way to get through, at least for me-I'll be up late again tonight Gil"
3,Harder Game Levels,"For those who hate gore, violence & evil creatures, this game's not for you...For starters, it's a violent shooting game sequel from PSX's DOOM version...Unlike in Duke Nukem 3D, you cannot jump nor crouch...The enemies are the same but they're more plenty...The mazes are harder but your weapons are still the same...Even though they've added extra levels like Plutonia and TNT, the graphics and the handling are quite the same...But don't fret, idSoftware would release DOOM III sometime this month on PC."
3,Writing's On The Wall? Not So Clear To Me!,"I first bought this CD the day it came out 'cause 'Bills Bills Bills' was kickin'. The next day, I was fixing to take it to a pawn shop and at least salvage some of my dignity. But then I thought, hey, I'll listen to it a couple more times and see what happens. Nothing changed. Still hated it, the only good song was 'Bills Bills Bills' but then 'Bugaboo' was released and I liked that one, then came 'Say My Name' liked that one too, and now 'Jumpin' Jumpin' came out and I love that one, so I guess this is a good radio friendly CD, worth buying if you like those tracks, and for the last track, the acapella version of 'Amazing Grace.' This is a good party album for the songs I mentioned, but there are no standouts, no other catchy songs like 'Bills.' Three Out Of Five."
5,This is the HOTTEST ALBUM OF '99!,"Destiny's Child-""Wrintg On The Wall"" is without a doubt the best R&B/Urban album realesed in 1999 along with TLC's new one. This album has got really great beats and smooth voclas from Beyonce & the rest of the group...there is even a little remake of the kid classic ""This Old Man"" which is transformed to a cool R&B song with catchy lyrics...If you dont have this album....GO GET IT! You wont be dissapointed at all =)!"
4,"Destiny' s Child ""writings on the wall"" ...","Cd Is Off The Hook. The Production On This Cd Is Solid wit a lil bouncy-feel groove to it. That's Why I Gave It 4 Stars. Beyounce Was Looking So Good On The Soul Train Awards Recently, And Sings Great Live, But She Couldn't Have Done It Without The Rest Of The Ladies That Helped Put Destiny's Child Where They At Now. In The Future I Would Like To Hear The Other 3 Members Bless Us With A Solo Every Now & Then On The Albums, & Continue Having Much Success With The Group As Well As The Two New Members Who Recently Joined. To The Other Two Ladies That Are Now Ex-Members Of Destiny's Child, Thank Yall For Blessing Us With Vocals On Both Albums. Congratulations, & You Deserve Every Bit Of The Success From The ""writing's on the wall"" CD. Sorry I Couldn't See You Two On The ""say my name"" Music Video. God Bless You Anyway. Go Pick The This Latest CD Now. You'll Enjoy It."
3,Love It But........,"I love Destiny's Child's latest album. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because by the time the 3rd track rolled around, I had gotten tired of listening to Beyonce's voice. If you are reading this, you can sing but give someone else a chance to sing once in a while. If not, you'll just end up like S.W.V., has beens."
4,Success for Destiny's Child,"These Girls Rock I really love their first album but this new one really really show their vocal abilities and growth in the music industry. I just wish Latavia & Latoya would have stayed on because their vocals were making it work as well as their beauty and charm! Im going to miss them dearly they made the group, but time will heal i hope they work out their differences ! But much SUCCESS with Beyonce', Kelly,Farrah & Michelle The album is Real!"
3,It's Alright,"Destiny's Child is a group of four talented young women. The active word should be four. My major gripe with the album is that most, if not all, of the leads are done by Beyonce. I do understand that it might be easier to designate a lead singer, but aren't the other girls capable of handling a song or two? Come on. Let's hear them. However, most of the songs are pretty good. I actually like Say My Name, Bug-A-Boo, and Bills Bills Bills. The rest are passable as well. So if you're looking for an album made by a group of talented sisters, get this one. Just don't be mad if you only hear one."
5,I'F YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD YOU BETTER GO GET IT!,"WELL I THINK THAT DESTINY'S CHILD CD IS THE BOMB AND IT'S ABOUT TO BLOW UP UP UP! I THINK THAT THE MUSIC ON THE CD HELPS THINK ABOUT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP YOU ARE IN IF HE KEEPS PAGING YOU HE'S A BUG A BOO. I'F HE DON'T NEVER SAY YOUR NAME THEAT MEANS THAT HE EITHER FORGOT YOUR NAME OR HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND,WIFE OR ETC.... I ALSO THINK THAT A GIRLS ARE VERY TALENTED."
5,EXCELLENT CD,DESTINY'S IS THE ONLY CD WHERE I LIKE EVERY SINGLE SONG I MEAN EVERY ONE. I MEAN THE ONLY REASON THAT NOT THE MANY PEOPLE ARE RESONDING TO THE VIDEO IS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THE ALBUM.
3,The C.D is Okay- I'll tell you why...,"Destiny's Child are good singers BUT why are most of their songs about blaming the man? Why aren't their songs about lovin' the man or somethin? They need more positive lyrics. Plus why is Beyonce' always singing? It's called a group. I got tired of hearing Beyonce' all the time anyway. The C.D should be called ""Beyonce' and Friends""Unless you really like them don't buy the C.D"
3,Eh...,"Ok, for starters, I'm not a really big fan of this kind of music. I'm more into Tori Amos, Indigo Girls, etc. etc. I also must admit that one of the reasons I bought this CD was because Missy Elliot helped out (though not very much help at all, I later learned) on one of the tracks...and Bills, Bills, Bills caught my attention. The slow songs on this CD, for the most part...SUCK. There are some really tight songs though. Jumpin' Jumpin', Where'd you go?, Bills, Bills, Bills (of course...probably the tightest), So Good, and Hey Ladies. I say, buy a Tori Amos CD and borrow Writing's on the Wall from someone else :o)."
4,The Writing's On The Wall - Destiny's child,"On this CD I have heard great r'n'b. I like Destiny's child music, and every single which I saw on TV was great. It was great to get their CD, songs are in their tipicall r'n'b sound and I could find some for dancing, some for cheering me up and some for thinking (emotional). But, I gave CD four stars cause some songs are very good, different and so and some are pretty similar and not so good. You know what I mean... Maybe Destiny's child could put less songs on CD but quality ones. Well, on whole CD I like strong voices of their singers, even thought La Toya and La Tavia are not in the band any more. But, if you like r'n'b you should definetly but this CD!"
4,I LOVE DESTINY's CHILD,"I loved this CD, there were a few songs that I didn't really enjoy, like Temptation, but otherwise its great. I'm not to big on hip hop but I love Destiny's Child and TLC, but Destiny's Child is better in my opinion. I RECCOMENT IT"
3,So-so but not TLC,"This cd is ok. If you like all their hit singles so far then you should get it. But they can't even compare to TLC. Destiny's Child is just trying to sound innovative and they succeed at this...but there's no feeling in these songs. TLC and En Vogue, real R&B groups, have much more emotion in the songs and they are more poignant. But DC is very catchy, it's kind of a guilty pleasure."
3,It's on you.,"What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said by hundreds of people in this review section? Well, let's see. It's a good album, yes. Is it groundbreaking, no. Is it ego-driven, yes. Is it the best album of the decade, no. Is it full of radio hits, yes. Is it generic, yes. Will it be remembered 10 years from now, no. Hmmm, I'll let you come to your own conclusion on whether or not you want to shell out the money to purchase this disc."
5,THE BEST!,"This album makes their old album look bad, this cd has WAY MORE good songs. Lots of sweat beats, bug a boo; bills, bills, bills, hey ladies, and jumpin' jumpin' (also on matrix soundtrack)"
1,I dont even want to make a catchy title for THIS album,"Imagine that you're walking down the street and some idiot hits you with a car. Better that than THIS. The constant annoyingly catchy songs just nver seem to end (especially once the chorus just wont stop playing in youre head) and the lyrics just become more and more pointless. bug-a-boo? couldnt they have come up with a real word or phrase like ""for god sake dont touch our album"". All they sing about are boyfreinds, clingy boyfreinds, cheap boyfreinds, lazy boyfreinds, etc etc. Oh yeah and bug-a-boos...? Basically this album could be described perfectly in one wod. Unfortunately I cant say that word so these will have to do ""PUUURRREEEE EEEEVVVVVIIILLLL"". Debate with me whenever you want."
2,Get Out,"Ok now No,NO,NO was a hit but it got played out after while just like this new cd. I mean after while Beyonce's voice becomes annoying and begins to make u wonder can any of the other members sing? I am not hatin or knockin these girls dreams but get another singer please! I don't advise anyone to buy the album find a friend that was a fool and bought it already."
4,beyonce is destiny's child!,"First off, I have to admit that the latest Destiny's Child album was one of my favorites. Most of the tracks on the album are very well produced, and most would make for hit singles. The obvious classics are ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" and ""Say my Name."" Others are ""Hey Ladies,"" ""So Good,"" and also, ""Now That She's Gone."" But now it makes me literally sick to my stomach to even look at the album cover and be reminded of the way that they broke up. I feel that it was a total slap in the face to the two ""dropped"" members of the group, Latoya and Latavia, to be so easily replaced like that and not given a second thought. In my opinion, I feel the fact that Beyonce sang lead on all sum-odd 15 tracks on the album, should have never happend. Though she has a lovely voice, it's a little 'forced' on the track ""Temptations,"" and sometimes gets a little irritating."
4,The Writings on the Wall.... rocks from beginning to end,I would recommend this CD to anyone who's interested in hip hop and R&B even in the slightest. Every song is awesome. There's a great variety of different beats and different sounds. It puts out a great dance mix: everything from fast to nice and slow and everything in between! Listen up for the awesome vocals in the last track.
5,Great CD,"I love this release from Destiny's Child. They have progressed. The only thing I don't like is the way they totally ditched two members and replaced them without any formality. Still I like them and I do enjoy this CD. My favorite songs are ""Confessions, Hey Ladies - Mad tight, Temptations, She Can't Love You and If You Leave"".Great Listening!"
5,This is a great CD.,This was a great CD. The music is really good and the lyrics are fantastic. I strongly recommend it.
4,say their name!!!,"They may be young but they are definitely going places. I might have expected a bit more from DC's sophomore effort but all in all it was more than okay. I totally loved the commandments for the songs and Say my name is my most favourite track. I also love So good, Bug a boo, Temptations, Where'd you go, Hey ladies (pretty fly), If you leave (totally a bom track!), and Stay and She can't love you are also awesome. All of you should definitely say their name!!!"
2,Pay my CD Bill,"It's hard to lump all the songs on this cd together however as a true fan of R&B I find the riffs on Jumpin Jumpin embarassing. I understand this music is selctively geared toward african american females 12-30, but the singing is flat and the hook lacks melody. Did I mention the lyrics? As for Bills Bills Bills it too lacks creative musical arrangement but I must admit it was catchy enough for the usual cd consumer, Female. I like some TLC. Erikah Badu can be great at times. The monotonous sound of Destinys Child is prevelant now in 2000 and aside from their good looks and relationship with female peers their music is candykorn dispensable!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ,"This is a GREAT CD for those with insomnia. I requested the CD for Christmas and that was the last day that I listened to it. Most of the songs are corny and the rest are over played on the radio. So if you are thinking of buying this CD Run, Run far! I hope this helps!"
3,Ehhh..,"This album was definetly mediocre. Maybe it was because I expected Beyonce to share the mic, or at least a variety in the topics on the album. THis album would probably be a favorite of a teenager heavily involved in drama, but if you are otherwise, i suggest you leave this album on the shelf. The only songs i like were the ones released, and the amazing grace outro (which is the reason for all 3 stars). I am posotive that if any other song had been released in place of the ones that were, the album wouldnt have reached the sales mark in which it did."
5,Destiny's Child not just your average R&B group,"Destiny's Child's first album received mild reviews, but much praise. Their second album is to be commended. They have proved their mettle against groups like 702 and TLC. Not to mention the fact that these girls have achieved superstardom at such a young age. The main force behind the group being only 18. Their songs are catchy, and you will find yourself singing them at the weirdest times. Bills, Bills, Bills, Bug a Boo, Jumpin Jumpin, and Say My Name are truly worth listening to. Their intro (a spoof of the Godfather) is well worth the first 30 seconds or so of this album. Not all the songs are about male bashing. Some have their points where the singer is trying to tell her guy the truth. All in all the album is definitely a must listen and must have for any music fan. The group was also nominated for two Grammy's proving that they are definetly a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. TLC beware!"
4,Nostalgic...,"I love alot of Destiny's Child's and Beyonce's songs, but this is not their strongest album. I would recommend their debut, or ""Survivor."" I like ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" and ""Bugaboo,"" and ""Jumpin'"" has a nice beat to it, but I skip over everything else.But I still love Destiny's Child...they are my favorite R/B group."
2,Simply standard,Say My Name is the only cool song on this.The rest is just weak.Bills Bills Bills is blatently ripping off No Scrubs.Go by a real r&balbum instead.
5,Destiny's Child: The best female singing group in the world,"Destiny's Child is the finest female group in the world, they come up eith one catchy hit song after another. There are 4 #1 hits on this album alone. The hit songs on this album are irresistable, you can't help but love how catchy the songs are. The best songs on this album are the #1 hits ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", ""Bug a Boo"", ""Jumpin Jumpin"" and ""Say My Name"". Other good songs include ""So Good"", Hey Ladies"". While the group has changed significantly since this album, there are now 3 members instead of 4. The vocal talents of this group are amazing. The lead singer Beyonc'e has a phenomenal voice as does 2nd lead singer Kelly Rowland. I love thier music and I look forward to many great things from them in the future"
4,The Destination is Multiplatinum,"This Cd is practically perfect. The beats are Burnin' and the Vocals are bangin'!!!! I love there style. My favorite songs are Intro(hilarious), Say Good, Bills, Say My Name, Hey Ladies, and outro(so sweet)! The hottest slow songs, Confessions and Temptations are So HOTTTT!!!! they just burn by themselves. I love those songs!!! there slinky and sexy. I only wish that everyone else got vocals too. Beyonce got 99% of the songs. I love her, but I would also like to here everyone else also too. other than that IT was off the hizzy!!!! anyone email me if you wanna talk about DC, Brandy, Aaliyah, Missy, Timbaland, or any other I am a guy and guys will love it!!"
5,These Women Have Some Skillz!!!!!!,"They have some mad pipes!!! I love them. Will all four of you marry me? The album is real tight even though they did a little male bashing. They are so fine. I'd do anything to meet them. I wish them more success. Did I mention how fine they are?? All of you other young ladies:DON""T HATE THEM!!!"
5,Glad I bought it!,"This CD is one of the best to come out in this year of tired albums. So stop hating, all true music fans go get it every song is good, you don't have to skip anything. Much love DC"
3,It Ain't all that!,"There are only a few tracks I like. The rest of the tracks are garbage. ""So Good"" is good but ""Say My Name"" and ""Jumpin' Jumpin'."" are the best. The last four tracks are not up to par. But it's worth buying."
3,good r&b album,"This cd isn't as good as TLC's ""Fanmail"", but has very good songs, for example, the Missy Eliott produced tracks, like ""Where'd You Go"", the great Rodeney Jerkins penned ""Say My Name"", among others. All tracks are great, may be ""Bug A Boo"" is the only bad track here. Beyonce is a great vocalist, and even if she sing almost everything on the whole album, it proves that she has talent."
4,Destined for More Success,"This sophomore attempt is successful! There are beats and lyrics that make your hips swirl, your neck pop and your arms sway in the air. These ladies are maturing in the industry and it shows in this album."
3,da bomb or a bomb?,"this is not my type of music, but my sister's subjected me to it enough in the car that i feel like i own this album. what i will say about this album is that for the type of music it's trying to be, it succeeds quite well. these songs make you want to dance, and more horrifyingly enough, sing along in the car. the problem with this album is overexposure: since all of these songs were so omnipresent on the radio, they feel distinctly of the year in which they came out. this isn't a lasting album, but it's a fun one, and one made before everything in the world became ""Beyonce Beyonce Beyonce"""
2,"an OK album, not great",This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
2,"Well...there are a few good songs, I guess","""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" ""Bug A Boo,"" and ""Say My Name"" are pretty good but....that's it. Even those songs aren't nearly as catchy as the ones found on Survivor. And their beats are so feverishly all-over-the-place, these songs are nearly impossible to hum along to. I've really never liked ""Jumpin Jumpin,"" it's SO overrated. It's way, WAY too slow to be a dance song, and the verses are incredibly aggravating, the chorus is the only fairly catchy part. And what in GOD's name these girls were trying to accomplish in the Intro is absolutely beyond me, it's downright disturbing. It is NOT the DC I know and love. It's like a scene out of Godfather or something....wtf are they smoking putting crap like that as the first track on their album, it gets it off to a horrible start!! DC's first two albums suck, and Destiny Fulfilled sucks too....the only album of theirs I can really recommend is Survivor."
3,The Gorup Destiny's Child is Better Than TLC !,"This next gorup Destiny's Child is can sing!, and dance's andcan do some badest beoiver on them selevs, So I think this alubmcan deiven themsleves. Like the songs ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and""Bug a Boo"" and My faviorte song is ""Temtaions"" Pece ya`ll."
2,Where's the groove? Where's the concept?,"The cats who are programming the tracks on this album are:1) Drinking way too much coffee...or... 2) Can't program/or produce to save their livesThis album is so fidgetty, so nervous and so random in it's concept, that it took all my energy just to survive one listen. It's really hard to stomach.This is the same ""cut and paste"" disposable R&B that seems to be polluting the airwaves these days.In contrast, check out TLC's Fanmail...it has alot of jittery, nervous stuff going on, yet it's balanced by some incredibly creative productions including hard core rap, techno R&B and a couple of Babyface cuts. The TLC girls also reveal many sides of themselves where as the Destiny's Child ladies.....just WHINE!"
3,Stop over-rating the album...,"Basically, the majority of the songs on the album are good. 'So Good' is a gem. However, all of Destiny's released songs actually let the standard of the CD down. Songs like 'Bug a Boo' are just really bland compared to the more emotive songs, such as 'Sweet Sixteen'. Ok, we all know the girls are beautiful, but i don't agree with everything they are singing about, for instance, all men aren't evil. I think that if Destiny's child used a more varied subject content, and that Beyonce let the others sing more, then then album would be greatly improved."
3,Ho-Hum.,"Beyoncé is a really good singer, first of all. Since I'm pretty sure the group will fall apart after their third album, I'm really anticipating her solo debut. For now, however, we have this. The album is okay. The songs I like best are ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" (It has surprising endurance), ""Confessions"" (It gets old after a while but I like it, and Missy's presence is limited to a few ad libs so I'm not sure why it's ""featuring"" her) and ""Say My Name,"" which is da bomb. Everything else, while well produced, is your average shiny electro-pop/R&B fare, circa 1999. I never really listen to this album much. Most people will probably like it well enough, but this won't be something people will be calling a classic in 20 years."
5,Off The Hook,"This is R+B music at its best. These girls can get any party going. The CD is soul searching, teen style. And they do a good job of it."
4,awsom,"Destiny's child, the writings on the wall, is a really good cd. its a mix of r&b and soul music. If you like the smash hits Bills, Bills, Bills, and Bug A Boo, you'll LOVE this cd."
4,YES YES YES!,"THE LATEST OFFERING FROM THESE 4 SOULFUL LADIES WERE TRULY AMAZING.INDEED THEY CAN REALLY SING ,DOIN' SOME FANTASTIC TWISTS AND TURNS,TRYING TO BRING THE BEST IN DELIVERING THE MESSAGE OF THE SONGS.THE EXPRESSION,THE EMOTIONS INDEED IT CAN SEEN. THE ALBUM RECEIVE TOP 10 STATUS IN ITS FIRST WEEK(#6)IN THE STATES.IT WAS ALREADY A PLATINUM SELLER,COMING DOUBLE. 'BILL BILL BILL' WAS A #1 GOLD SINGLE FOR THE GROUP IN THE STATES. 'BUG A BOO' SET THEIR POPULARITY ONE STEP HIGHER. THE SONG IS SIMPLY FABULOUS.OTHER GREAT STUFF LIKE 'GET ON THE BUS','AMAZING GRACE' MAKE IT EVEN BETTER.THIS IS REALLY A TRIBUTE TO R&B MUSIC. BUY IT IF YOU LIKE BLACK MUSIC!"
5,Destiny's Child have done it once again!!!!,"Oh yeah. Oh baby!!!! This album is just TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT!!!! If you haven't bought the album yet, you're missing out on one of the best albums of the year. I'm am not just saying this because I like Destiny's Child but it's true!!! I got the album the second day it came out and I was just so happy because ever since radio stations and commmercials talked about it, I was like, ""I WANNA GET IT!!!"". I was just so crazy. So get it!!! It's already gone platinum in USA. Forget Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, BSB and all those other teen pop singers. Destiny's Child can REALLY REALLY REALLY sing!!! The album deserves to be #1!!!! GO GET IT!!!!"
4,"Like their voices, but some songs are drab","I really like this album, but there are a few songs that let it down- mainly the slushy ballads which don't really stand out. However, 'Bills Bills Bills' is absolutely pumpin and 'So Good' is such a success anthem! Other best songs include 'Get on the Bus', 'Jumpin Jumpin' and 'Bug a Boo'. Oh and 'Say my Name' is great too. The Godfather intro is really funny and they also have good voices that harmonise well together. In short, a nice R&B album, but girls, stick to the fast tracks- which tend to have more enticing melodies."
2,"Vocally talented, but so what?","These girls have got a lot of talent, yes. They can really wail out a tune. But the production side, which is obviously responsible for the crisp finished product that is advertised as ""Destiny's Child"", could have steered this release a little further toward originality, and not just the same old tired ""my man cheated on me"" and ""I cheated on my man"" nonsense. Still better than bubble gum pop, but lacking the soul that makes some acts great while others are, as the reviewer says up front, ""disposable"". I saw them live on their first tour several years back, and I wonder... if Wyclef hadn't pushed them so hard, would many people have been saying their name in the first place?"
2,So-So,"Compared to their first Cd, Destiny's Child hasn't gotten better. Too many songs on here sound alike, too much alike. And the lyrics are sometimes corny and simple. The only standout tracks are ""Bills Bills Bills"", ""Say My Name"" and ""Where'd You Go"". Other than that it is just average, very unorignal R&B. I recommend Pink's ""Can't Take Me Home"" which is far better."
4,VANESSA SMITH,I THINK THESE GIRLS HAVE A GREAT VOICE AND A GREAT ATTITUDE THERE IS ONLY ONE THING I DON'T LIKE IS WHY IS BEYONCE ALWAYS SINGING DON'T GET ME WRONG SHE HAS LOVELY VOICE BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HEAR KELLY FARRAH AND MICHELLE SOMETIMES BUT YA'LL KEEP DOING WHATEVER CAUSE YOU IS TEARIN THE CHARTS UP.
5,It is excellent!,I think this album was really great because they also did a song to god.Hope you come out with more.bye
5,This is like the 2nd best music ever!,"This CD, is like the next best to the top, And it's music has this deep beat that makes you dance. I would recomend this allways!"
4,It's obvious these girls have skillz!,"This album from the beautiful quartet is a big step up from their debut a couple of years ago. This new album offers nice beats and great production. It has good uptempo tracks such as ""Hey Ladies"" and ""Jumpin', Jumpin'"". There are also some nice ballads like ""Now That She's Gone"". Other noteworthy tracks includes ""Say My Name"" produced by Rodney Jerkins, ""So Good"" the song dedicated to all the haters out there and ""Sweet Sixteen"". The sophomore album is definitely more mature than the first and shows off their talent more. The album can relate to basically anyone and has originality and potential, so it would be a good purchase for anyone."
5,The Writings All Over The Wall. 10/10,"This is bar far Destiny's Child's best album yet far. This album features nothing but hot tracks. Even though Beyonce may steal the shine on every track the album is still blazing hot. ""So Good"" is the anthem for people who have made it and this is a for all the haters also. ""Bills Bills Bills"" is another banging jam, this joint you all know and I love this song. ""Confessions"" is an amazing slow jam oh this song is so seductive with Beyonce's voice sounding so good. The best party songs on the cd are ""Where'd You Go"", ""Hey Ladies"", and ""Jumpin Jumpin"". You all know the hit ""Say My Name"" and you know this joint is on fire. My favorite tracks are ""Stay"", ""Sweet Sixteen"", and ""Temptation"", but hey pick up this album because this is ""THE BEST R&B ALBUM EVER, EVER."
4,THEY ARE YOUNG AND ENREGETIC,"I'M A YOUNG FEMALE IN COLLEGE OF WAYNE NEW JERSEY,BUT THAT DOES NOT EVEN MATTER. THE POINT IS THEY ARE DOING THERE THING. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BECAUSE WE ARE CONSIDER THE X GENERATION!"
2,"I liked this movie in the theater, but...","I liked this movie when I saw it in the theater, but... this isn't the movie I saw in the theater. Hey, if a director wants to get his or her jollies by recutting a movie, go for it, but at least make sure the original theatrical version is available. I've seen this movie many times, but the additional mish-mash of scenes on the bloated director's cut detract from the drama and tension of the original. Historical inaccuracies aside, this was a thought-provoking movie when it was released; Now, in it's current incarnation, it only provokes. When I see the director's cut, I am taken out of the movie with thoughts of how much better it used to be."
1,Typical Overblown Tripe,"I always find Stone and Costner movies overblown and their supposedly knowledeable insider views misleading at best. This movie is for conspiracy and other nuts only. It assumes that it is right and a realistic view of history. I'd like to see a JFK movie without the opinions and based upon fact, at least that which is know or can be realistically supposed. Turn your brain off when you watch this movie and it may be alright. I can't get past the santimonious attitude."
1,JFK - T'aint O.K.,"""Director's Cut? I don't think so- unless Stone is as sloppy as some of his plot ideas are questionable."
4,"If nothing else, watch it for Gary Oldman's performance","There's a lot to like about this film--the direction and editing are fantastic, many of the performances are very good. Kevin Coster is a little out of his depth, but since he plays the investigator that leads us through the conspiracy theories his usual blandness is excusable. The standout for me was Gary Oldman's performance as Lee Harvey Oswald. I didn't even recognize him at first because of his perfect accent, mannerisms, etc. Take the ""facts"" with a grain of salt and enjoy the cinematic experience."
4,Everybody is in this movie,Kevin Costner does a great performance as Jim Garrison. Joe Pesci(GoodFellas) makes an outstanding role as the hyperjenic David Ferrie. John Candy is great for an Oliver Stone role. Brian Doyle-Murray has a suprising role as Jack Ruby. The mixing of B/W is beutiful. Tommy Lee Jones is Clay Shaw. Gary Oldman is rivieting as Lee Harvey Oswald. Director: Oliver Stone Cast:Kevin Costner(Jim Garrison)Joe Pesci(David Ferrie)John Candy(Dean Andrews)Jack Lemmon(Martin)Walter Matthau( Russel Long)Donald Sutherland(X)Tommy Lee Jones(Clay Shaw)
3,Director's Cut Worse Than Original Print Released,"In the director's cut, James Garrison (Kevin Costner) ends a scene by telling an aide (Jay O. Sanders) that they're going to have to bring in Clay Shaw for questioning--BEFORE Garrison learns that the real name of Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw! This makes no sense. The added 17 or so minutes do not enhance the film, which was terrific in its initial release. Sorry, Oliver Stone, but whoever persuaded you to drop those minutes & alter sequences was right. Bring back the print first released: it was a great film."
4,An real historic testimony,"A very nice & elegant digibook! This movie that i had never seen before is a real historic testimony! Very good picture and immersive sound trackBut one small problem with the authoring of this blu-ray disc (i have a Sony BDP-S550) : the popup menu and item selection (language choice, bonus choice) do not seem to work correctly! In fact they works, it's just a bug of item selection displaying! You need to count each keystrokes and moves on your remote controller to guess the position"
3,The Conspiracy,"I don't have an opinion on the events of November 22 1963, perhaps its because I don't live in America or had not yet been born. In spite of that I have always found this story intriguing. While it does make you think there are some scenes in the film which make you think that Garrison is incredibly naive. Nevertheless, the final half hour is gripping as his theory of events unfolds.The picture quality of the DVD is excellent and the sound is good. On the negative side this DVD not only lacks any features it is also a flipper. I don't mind too much as after the first 100 minutes the break was welcome. For those who hate flippers or want features - avoid this one."
5,JFK for real,"Having recently gotten back from my first trip to Dallas, this movie brought back some deep emotions as to what actually happened. First rate in my book."
4,"Great film, interesting opinions",I thought this movie was great. Oliver Stone's theory on what happened back then seems like the most likely. Super interesting to see it all unfold in a well acted movie.
5,Great movie,This is Kevin costners best film besides dances with wolves. This movie will defiantly open your eyes. Very well made and the cast is perfect. This is a must own film . The directors cut is the one to buy. Could watch this movie a hundred times and never lose interest and each time you will pick up more and more out of this film. Greatttttttttt
5,Great film,In my opinion no matter if you agree or not with this movie it is still very good. I thought that there was some very good actors playing the parts. I thought it was strange that they got Jim Garrison to have a bit part as Earl Warren.One strange thing i noticed in the trial portion was when they were showing the film of the killing.When the last shot that they saycame from behind the picket fence.If as soon as the film shows the guy firing the last shot slow the film down on one frame advance and see if you see anything that looks like a bullet coming toward his head. Maybe i am wrong but it sure looks like it if you keep one frame advancing until the bullet hits. I may be way off base on this.I would ask that you check it for yourself.If i am wrong it wouln't be the first time.
4,CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE,"I don't understand why people gave this movie such a hard time when it first came out. Some people saw it as an awful piece of Stonian propaganda; I saw it as a film about a man's theories on the JFK assassination and his quest for the truth--not necessarily, THE truth, but Truth in general. (To you historians--lighten up! However, I will agree with you about the ""enhanced"" Zabruder film --a complete and total abominable fabrication.) Whether you disagree with me or not is besides the point, however--politics aside, JFK is still a brilliantly made, compelling and breathtaking film about a particular point in American history (the mid-1960's) that's rarely been captured on film--of when people started questioning those very institutions that up until then had seemed rock solid. If you missed that, then I really feel sorry for you, 'cuz you missed a really great film."
5,great movie,I have had this movie for several years but wanted it on Blu-ray. It is the very best movie about Kennedy
5,big brother and veracity is an oxymoron,"Oliver Stone's magnum opus based on speculation and searing fact is a plea for sanity,truth and the call for accountability to the masters of the universe who treat the honest and the dissident with so much contempt."
1,"Oh, please!","I find it incredible that anyone could take this badly directed, badly scripted piece of historical revision seriously. Even if you ignore the homophobic, paranoiac re-writing of facts, the film seems to be the work of an over enthusiastic college student. No, make that junior high school. Agonizingly bad writing, self-indulgent acting . . . Oliver Stone used to be a decent film maker, but I wish he would just get his frustrations out on an analyst's couch and leave the rest of us in peace."
1,Nonsense by any other name is still nonsense,Persons who think this movie to be based on fact would do well to examine the evidence a tad more carefully than this travesty of a film does.
1,JFK,Was VERY saddened to the fact that this is a two disc special edition and the second disc was MISSING!!!

3,"Fascinating, Overbearing","A fascinating catch-all of every possible JFK conspiracy theory. Brilliantly made and edited, the narrated flashbacks are dazzling examples of cinema. Unfortunately, every now and then characters have to sit and talk to each other, and the writing becomes laughable. Poor Sissy Spacek bears the brunt of it, as Jim Garrison's neglected wife who dares to look askance at her husband awakening in the middle of the night with assassination on his lips.Also, the film insists that it's own particular view of the events that took place at Dealy Plaza are the only accurate ones, and that anyone who dares to think otherwise is a dupe, and hence a conspirator, and part of the problem rather than the solution, and so on. Since when did Oliver Stone get the monopoly on Truth?"
5,Great!,My husband & I both loved the movie. It was very well done and had our attention the whole time. It has a lot of very good actors and they all played their part so well. We highly recommend it.
4,Generation X's Version of JFK's Assassination,"As I was not born when Kennedy was killed and therefore have only an academic understanding of those troubled times, this movie struck me as a particularly potent form of propaganda. Perhaps it was the fantastic craftsmanship and skill with which JFK was made that transform it into such a powerful instrument of revisionist history.I am afraid that this will become my generation's only point of reference to this event. We are not, sadly, very well equiped to sort out fact from fiction. JFK is neither balanced, nor fair, but it is mesmerizing and it will probably stand the test of time better than the truth itself."
5,Something to think about for the critics of this movie.,"Once again the minority of people who think they are ""the enlightened open-minded"" have spoken against this movie. I've found that many people take movies so seriously that they can't enjoy what it really is. This is an excellent movie that may not have all the facts, but presents a few areas of this tragedy that cast some doubt on the way this assasination was carried out and possibly covered up. It may not be the absolute truth of how the assasination took place, but it points out very well the established fact that there is something not right about the entire incident. An excellent film that you should draw your own conclusions from."
5,JFK : The Questionable Assassination,"Oliver Stone's film JFK addresses the underlying questions that every American has in back of their mind: How many people were involved in the assassination of JFK? The concept of this film raised many questions and concerns that have been unanswered since the assassination. This film tries to explore every possible aspect of the assassination, with the conclusion, as Oliver Stone and Jim Garrison believe, a massive cover-up by the government, media, and every possible person that has been in contact with President John F. Kennedy. Not just one person, but many were involved. This film is an excellent re-making of that horrid day in Texas. Oliver Stone has made this film with the same intent that every other person wants to know: Who is involved and why?"
5,The Best 3 Hour Film I have ever seen,"Stone has created a masterpiece. The monologue of Donald Sutherland and the scene where Costner explains how he believes JFK was shot make this movie one of the most memorable that I have ever seen.The only problem with this film is that the viewer is not sure if everything that is presented as fact, really is fact and not the invention of Stone for dramatic affect."
5,JFK,"In my opinion, this is one of Oliver Stone's finest movies. There is not a moment throughout the entire movie that you are not captivated with the story. Excellent picture."
5,Oliver Stone's masterpiece,"This controversial film by Oliver Stone on the JFK assasination has taken on a life all its own. I recently saw it again on HD Net and I was drawn into it all over again by the brilliant performances, Stone's direction and the story itself. Many people have criticized Stone for taking liberties with the story but this is not a documentary this is a drama!! Costner is brilliant in particular and his summation scene in court is belongs to his best work (also counting his role in Eastwood's ""A Perfect World""). The aim of an artist is to make us question the truth and Stone has certainly succeeded at that. Remember how many people felt the plot in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" grows eerily factual as time goes by!! If you are repelled by the current events now unfolding before us--the Iraq war, the recession--do see this film again!!"
4,It's about doubt!!,"This is an excellent film. Because it makes you think, and rethink, the facts. I don't understand how anyone could be CONVINCED Oswald was the lone gunman. There is so much doubt everywhere you look. And that is ALL Stone asks his audience to do with this film: question the facts as presented by the government, who's case is pretty flimsy. By his own admission, Stone has referred to JFK as an ""alternate myth"". He doesn't know. But if you look at all the facts, you can't help but be led in other directions. I think he does a pretty good job of busting up the government's story, if not creating his own."
1,JFK....well....not really,"As a movie, it's fine. As history, it's absurd.Based on one man's neurosis (albeit, hard to tell if that one man is Stone or Garrison), JFK purports to explain the ""conspiracy"" behind the Kennedy assassination. If you choose to believe it, you delude yourself. No good evidence exists that has not been explained logically in coherence with the single-assassin-Oswald theory. Sadly, many more people will believe Stone's fraudulent tale than will ever consider investigating the details of the murder in a logical, un-hyped analysis.Better not to see it at all....."
2,overblown junk from an over blown director!,"When this movie came out everyone was talking about it. It was up for Best Picture against Silence of The Lambs, Bugsy, and Beauty And The Beast. Looking back at 1992's Oscars, JFK should never been in there.The Acting, from great actors, is over the top like in so many of Stone's films. Not everything is supposed to be like a Greek tragedy! Too many cutaways, and too many half assed historical ""facts"".Stone's best work will always be Platoon. That movie had it's over done scenes, but, it never went overboard like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday . . . well, all his flicks since 1987's Wall Street.For anyone foolish enough to still retain affects from the conspiracy talk . . . it's just a movie from a bad director."
1,Utter Bull,"If Garrison could bring his load of bull to court,I can see why their are innocent people in prison and on death row. Fools are easily fooled. I hope Garrison had to pay court costs for wasting the people's money. SHAME ON YOU STONE."
1,Oliver Stone's Lies are criminal!,"This is a great film except the only factual event portrayed by Oliver Stone was that JFK was assassinated! Jim Garrison is one of the more despicable figures in American history, and Stone glorifying him is downright wrong. I find it interesting that Stone's version of events stops short of Garrison getting hauled into federal court and ordered...ordered! by the sitting federal judge to leave Clay Shaw alone. If you don't believe me, read False Witness by Patricia Lambert. She de-bunks the Garrison myth with actual facts. In fact, the History Channel just aired a documentary based on her book, and Oliver Stone refused to be interviewed for it. Read the book, throw away the movie. Distorting history like Stone did is shameless."
4,Entertaining,It looks back on a disturbing moment in my personal history (I was only four years old) and the countries history with some feeling of the times.
2,"Conspiracy Movie - No More, No Less","If you want to watch Oliver Stone's take on the JFK assasination, by all means, watch this movie. But don't take this film version of events as gospel truth. Its a conspiracy movie, pure and simple. Oliver Stone's version of what HE thinks happened.John F. Kennedy was a conservative democrat compared to today's liberal democrats. I can't believe people actually considered this movie as uncovering the TRUTH. Give me a break. This film bored me to death."
1,"Poor history, bad acting, terrible movie","This is truly a bad movie....The historical ""premise"" is incorrect. JFK expanded the war in Vietnam, and there is no reason to believe that he would have changed his mind if he had not been assasinated. The conspiracy plot is laughable. I did not think it was possible for me to feel sympathy for Lyndon Johnson, a failure as President, but the movie almost invoked those feelings by portraying him as a conspirator against JFK. Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison. His accent is amateurish, for example. Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor who puts in a credible performance."
1,Slander,"This movie is pure slander and libel against a man--Claw Shaw--who was found innocent in a court of law. Would those rating this movie highly care if, after they were dead, I made a movie claiming they had killed John Lennon or Tupac Shakur? That this movie ever got a budget from a major movie studio is highly highly disturbing. But, of course, ........ will probably think my pointing this out is too controversial for my review to be posted. More controversial than Oliver Stone accusing an innocent man of murder. I'm glad his and Kevin Costner's movie careers have slid into the abyss. It's what both men deserve for slandering Clay Shaw. If you want to read the true story of the Kennedy Assasination, read Gerald Posner's book CASE CLOSED. Oswald killed Kennedy, and he was a lone gunman."
1,Tedium,"This was one of the most boring and uninteresting movies that I have ever sat through. The message was just as dubious. ""Is the government worth preserving when it lies to the people?"" My answer: ""Since when have governments ever done anything else?"" It was just a big waste of time."
1,Idiotic from start to finish,"Oliver Stone managed to create a quilt of lunacy, fantasy, some facts, and downright lies. Anyone that comes away thinking that they saw some facts regarding the JFK murder, is actually fooling themselves. Don't waste anytime with this tripe."
4,Great movie...kinda boring in some parts though...,"This was an awesome movie. It's one of my favorites. Oliver Stone did an excellent job directing this gripping movie about the assassination of JFK. It really makes you think about how HUGE the conspiracy was, how it stretched through all braches of government, just for money. While it is boring in some parts, I recommend this court room drama to anyone curious about the assassination of the President on November 22, 1963."
3,Interesting but implausible,"The viewer is left with a lot of questions, the biggest one being: ""So, WHO exactly was responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy?"" Oliver Stone offers an extremely complex, incredibly unconvincing argument that the CIA, exiled Cubans, the Mafia and big business were somehow all involved. William of Occam could offer a much more likely theory, but that story wouldn't have been as interesting. Still worth seeing, but don't take it seriously."
4,Good But Facts Mixed Up!,This movie was very good. But some of the facts in there are either misleading or VERY false. I do like the mivie and for someone learing about a history event I am glad I pick this one
3,A great FICTIONAL account of JFK's assassination!,"Oliver Stone has a story to tell, and he won't let the facts interfere, at least that's how I viewed this one. The setting up of that fateful day in 1963 was well done, but casting Ed Asner as some right-wing conspirator was the beginning of what turns out as a ludicrous, unbelievable plot. And Kevin Costner's over-long court scenes had me squirming in my seat, just waiting for this one to finally end! The people who love the JFK conspiracy theories may have loved this movie, but I thought it was forced and over-long."
4,JFK Movie,Saw this on the History channel. Have wanted it since. Excellent movie. All about JFK. If you like history I would recommend this item.
4,My review of JFK blu-ray,I would definitly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good introductionto the whole JFK assassination conspiracy theory and facts surrounding his death.
5,NEVER WAS MEANT TO BE COMPLETELY FACTUAL!,"Mr. Stone accomplished exactly what he started out to do. Bring renewed public interest in the crime of the century. Anyone who watches this film and assumes that everything in it is exactly the way it was, has been led down the wrong path. How could anyone know EXACTLY what was said and done by the conspirators and key players before and after the assassination? Oliver Stone has done an excellent job in his INTERPRETATION of the events surrounding the murder. Those who criticize it are either wearing blinders or are afraid of something. Maybe the truth? Highly recommended to every American citizen."
3,Well-written but somewhat bleak historical melodrama,"This is a somewhat grim historical melodrama/romance. It's well-written and enjoyable and I personally did not find it depressing, but I imagine that others might. Not exactly a fluffy ""beach read"" nor a cute, happily-ever-after type of romance.This novel is far, FAR better-written than the type of crappy ""romance novel"" you'd find at the grocery store.But yeah, there's lots of tragic events, the overall tone is rather melancholy and it's not quite a frothy ""guilty pleasure"" type of book."
5,Melodic death metal with a kick!,"If you are a fan of Arch Enemy, In Flames, or Meshuggah, pick this disc up instantly. Every song is grand and well put together. Vocals can get a bit annoying at times, but technicality and talent make up for it rather nicely. This is, in my opinion, one of the best metal albums of '99.Infinity Driven (ICQ 42007137)"
5,The SH|T,"Intelligent, intricate, melodic thrash, with absolutely incredible vocals by Lawrence Mackrory. Well produced-- I use this CD to test new audio systems.This is the CD I play when I want to make my neighbors nervous... when Morbid Angel and Meshugga are too soft. When Soilent Green and Cannibal Corpse are too slow and Goatwhore and Death are too soothing. This CD makes Six Feet Under sound like Brian Gumble on karaoki night. It makes Slayer sound like the Mormon Boy's Choir.They might try to be too pompous with the orchestrations and too serious/literal with the lyrics (definitely not Ana1 C*nt.) But then let's see you write something in Swedish."
2,"Some good advice, but not worth buying","I started reading this book, and while it seems to have some good points, the writing is pretty bad (strange for a book on writing to be poorly written). She keeps repeating herself over and over, about how successful she is. While trying to inspire, she is also depressing, that it may take years or decades to get yourself established. I don't think so...sounds like she's just trying to make money from this book, yet wants to discourage any new competition! Take my advice and buy the ""Well Fed Writer"" by Peter Bowerman. His advice is better, his writing is funny and very readable, and he doesn't speak to the reader like they're a moron. Which Flynn does, by the way."
3,A mixed review - but mostly I liked it,"...Overall, I found the thoughts shared in this book to be valuable for anyone who wants to be a freelance. And frankly, I appreciated Nancy's honesty that earning a six-figure income from writing takes time - sometimes 10 years or more. Personally, I'm weary of reading authors who promise overnight success. Nancy's views on long-standing hard-work to success seems to be more in keeping with my experience..."
4,This book is ok,"Bought this as a reference book for a class I was taking, like most of my reference books, it didn't get to be used at all."
5,Wouldn't Be Without It,"I cannot imagine not having this great little book around. Even in these days of Vista, I still find many uses, and learn new stuff, from it. A must-have for any administrator, or anyone just wanting to get more from the command line (yes, it still exists). ;-)"
1,Do not waste your time with this movie,"While the DVD was technically well done; transfer was good, sound was good. The content was without merit. It seemes to strive for a Short Stories feel but it fell far short. I for one, do not need to see a bunch of ""walk-in"" scenes. They have no real dramatic effect.Do not waste your time or your money on this dog.D not waste your money on this dog."
4,Beautiful and Erotic,"I was at the video store, and I saw the cover for this movie and though ""wow, this looks interesting"", so I rented it. The cinematography in this film was very well done, and Saffron Burrows was really good in it. The film dealt with a lot of differen't character's problems, so I can't explain all of it. Saffron Burrows's character was a twin that was seperated at birth and when she sees her twin in an airport, things get a tad confusing for her. Also, this movie talks a lot about the creation of man and woman, very much like a modern day ""Adam and Eve"". I suggest you see this if you like the less main-stream movies."
3,thinks it's more clever than it is,"The film itself, on an aesthetic level, is quite stunning and beautiful, but the non-linear narrative, which weaves in two modern (? ) tales with an inventive representation of Adam and Eve starts to unravel a bit as the story progresses--which is unfortunate, because the film does such a subtle job of telling a story without spelling it all out for the viewer. My only strong reservation is that the funeral scene characters were never woven back into the narrative concerning J. Sands--a frustrating omission that derails an otherwise compelling essay on the issue of desire, sex, love, and loyalty. But it's definately interesting and beautiful to watch."
2,Thoroughly disappointed,"I read a few reviews here saying things like, ""brilliantly ambitious"" and ""not your mainstream movie"" ... how the movie makes you think and how colorful and amazing it is.Well, it's not. I've seen and enjoyed plenty of other silent, artsy, foreign, or otherwise ""non-mainstream"" movies, and this is one of the most dull and boring by far. Make that painfully boring. No message, nothing to chew on, no insight. How can a film be considered poignant when everything in it is so blatantly obvious? Not to mention pretentious. The slow panning landscape shots were lackluster and poorly chosen reeking of a low budget and lack of creativity. The only moment that broke the mold was when full nude Adam and Eve urinated in front of each other. +1 star for WTF factor.I tried to like it, I really did. I sat through straight to the end thinking ""surely it has SOME insight..."". Alas, I was thoroughly disappointed."
1,huh?,"i watched it tonight. i am confident that most of this film was shot without the benefit of a script or direction. most of the movie makes no sense; the scenes play out of sequence and bear little relation to one another (except the adam and eve stuff).there is a hilarious incident with a blind woman and her... aware dog. i would not watch this movie if i were you, though."
2,I'm sorry I saw this,"...and you will be if you decide to make the same mistake I made.I kept hearing and reading good reviews about this films. Now, I knew that Mike Figgis's work is not always accessible, but I never expected this kind of a mess. Not only does this film move at an excruciatingly slow pace, but it avoids making sense most of the time. The different stories sort of intertwine but they never really connect.Saffron Burrows acts as if she was bored throughout the filming...All in all: avoid this film now...thank me later."
2,Too artsy and boring,"After his masterpiece ""Leaving Las Vegas"" I was looking forward to the next film from the talented Figgis but this is one of the most boring films ever made. I love slow, art-house films and having more music than dialogue was intriguing but this one just put me to sleep. A cure for insomnia. How could the twins at the airport not talk to each other? Maybe I missed something."
2,dull!,its a dull film- theres not nearly enough JRM in it as id liked and some unknown reason we keep getting these pictures of rivers and babies and this Adam and Eve duo! does anyone understand what its about except the director?
2,Too Artsy-Fartsy,"I will grant that I don't watch a lot of art or independant films, but I checked this one out because I think Saffron Burrows is a fine actress and incredibly beautiful. This movie seems to be trying to impress people with an ""artistic"" re-invention of the Garden of Eden tale woven with a more modern tale. I got what he was trying to say with this (or at least most of it), but I thought the movie and its' message just didn't work."
3,why original sin anyway,"There is so much symbolism and obscure reference in this film that I am not at all certain I grasp what the producer/director had in mind. There are some wonderful moments - like the twins who almost meet - well, they do meet but the moment of recognition is shattered by a breaking bottle of wine. There is quite a lot of nudity in the film - but it's certainly not erotic.The most obvious interludes relate to the Garden of Eden and original sin. I don't think the intention of the film was to shift my perspective, but it did. Why was the tree of knowledge forbidden, and the serpent the tempter? Why wasn't the tree of knowledge intended for man's indulgence, and the serpent the opposition man (and woman) had to pass through? The reward would then be the gift of life - the greatest gift of all (even though it is tainted inevitably with death) - and sex, far from being the corruption it is so often seen as, would be the wonderful instrument of acceptance and the mantra of life."
2,Don't Blink...,"this movie was definitely a mind-engager. It isn't the sort of film you can chat through, or you might not understand it at all. When I purchased this DVD, I expected something entirely different...This film has sort of a lost, lonely feel to it. The scenarios are loosely jointed and have little to do with each other, but the characters' emotions are poignant and realistic. The ""stories"" within the movie just kind of fall together; there isn't a climax of any sort. It was interesting, though-worth checking out just for the experience."
4,Gotta see it to believe it.,"2001: A Space Odyssey meets Blue Velvet. It's as carefully paced and music-laden as the former, as far from redemption as the latter. Don't read any blurbs or summaries, just watch it."
4,Pants for golf,I got these pants primarily for golf. They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free. Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn.
2,too baggy,"I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them, so much so that I have not worn them at all."
5,Great weekend pants,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."
3,Pants look good,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
2,Very poor DVD Quality,"Yes this was dubbed and would have been much better with subtitles. The really disappointing aspect is the very poor quality of the video picture. The quality does not even rise to the level of an old VHS copy. It is not only very poor, but the picture tends to jump and skip. The colors are faded and the sound quality is also poor. The technical defects render this product almost unwatchable."
2,"Great movie, bad DVD","I was misled by the review which stated that this was the DVD from NoShame. My fault, I didn't read the comments under the review. When I was about to order, I saw that the label should be Koch. I have several DVDs from Koch and am happy with the quality. The item I received is from EPI (Entertainment Programs Incorporated). The movie is full screen, blurred, and dubbed. I was very disappointed. I should have bought the version released by Eureka. The movie itself was great. I love Vittorio de Sica works."
3,A full Italian experience,"This movie is divided into three different love stories, definitely takes you back to Southern Italian living about thirty years ago, and as such it provides the full spectrum of charming,humorous and manupalitive dynamics played out between a man and a woman - mostly from a female viewpoint.If you love Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroiani at the height of their popular common career point and want to get some cultural impression of Italy it is worthwhile to dive into,but it sure is bit too ""yesterday"" for today's movie expectations."
5,don't be confused is right!,"there is a remastered version of this available on amazon. blue cover bad, brown cover good. look for remastered in the title line. remastered version is going for about $45 used, $49 new. version not worth buying about $10 new."
2,Poor Reproduction of Great Movies,"This is an extremely disappointing copy of 3 great original movies. Looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old, used VHS tapes. No wonder it's hard to find out who made this. I wouldn't want to take credit for it, either. Hard to enjoy in this poor format. My delivery took place in February, 2006."
5,The NoSHame edition is the one you want,"After putting up with horrendous prints of this Academy Award winning Best Foreign Film, there finally comes a version that may restore this movie to its rightful classic status. A beautiful widescreen presentation in Italian w/English subtitles and the English dubbed version. (Don't frown. Loren beautifully dubs her own voice. And I don't know who dubs for Mastroianni, for some reason I never thought it was him, but it's a great job.)Also included is a deluxe booklet, alas from the japanese pressbook, that has lots of photos and some English."
3,"Sophia Loren's ""Yesterday""","Product in good condition. However, the movie is in Italian with English subtitles, and this was NOT clearly stated in the ads. I would not have purchased it had I known."
5,Classic Loren -,"Marcello Mastroianni is a most willing foil to Loren in this tripple vignette (total of 118 minutes) production. From 1963, the style is just as classic as the scripts and acting. Loren is so beautiful - - - ah, that has all been said before; she was/is an icon of the sixties (and more, of course) and a treasure to film."
1,A Defective DVD,"This DVD is of very low quality. The resolution reminds me of low-grade video tape. The sound is at times compromised by a low-level rushing, roaring sound. The color is washed out in places and several degrees off in hue at times. I'm quite certain that Carlo Ponti (Producer)and Vittorio de Sica (Director) did not produce films of this poor quality. The DVD was judged to be unacceptable."
1,YesterdayToday & Tomorrow (EPI),"I am a Loyal Amazon customer from Australia with a large collection of Laserdiscs-DVD's and Blue Ray Discs.This Dvd Yesterday Today & Tomorrow is the ""Worst copy of any format that i have seen even worse than a cheap budget VHS Tape,(Claims to be Digitally Remastered by EPI)i would not even give it one star for picture or sound.Please Amazon do not stock this Junk and send it to your customers.There must be a quality version available from a reputable studio.W.Davies"
1,"Yeasterday, Today and Tomorrow","I watched this DVD for three minutes, then threw it in the garbage.The quality was that poor."
2,"A disappointing, mediocre copy","The product was extremely disappointing in quality. The photography was sometimes blurred, the soundtrack uneven, and the editing uneven as well. For example, the famous striptease scene near the end of the film on this version on screen consisted only of a women's stocking flying in the air from the right border of the picture. While stockings and belt are the only clothing items removed by Sophia Loren, the viewer does not see her take them off.I have seen other versions of this movie and bought this copy only because I could not obtain one of them. The copy I purchased compares unfavorably with the others I have viewed, especially the DVD copy I later borrowed from the public library."
4,"yesterday,today and tommorrow",marcello and sophia at the top of their game togethermust see movie u willlove it
1,snookered at Xmas...,"Buyers Beware-do NOT buy this item from the company advertising it at the attractive $10.48 cent price! I did, and instead of the version from NoShame that the seller promises, what I received was a low quality dvd that was dubbed in English, with a completely different slimline box cover from an inferior no name manufacturer. I saw this dvd 2 years ago at the old Tower Records in the bargin bin for $5.00! I did't want it then, and I don't want it now. Online sellers shouldn't advertise items that they have no intention of delivering."
1,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow should Never be like this!","I believe the Amazon.com Editorial Review is self explanatory. This film is a masterpiece, an important component of Sofia Loren's filmography and one of her most admired performances.Now let's address this DVD release! It was apparently transfered from deteriorated film elements, horrendous (jolts) pan and scan with an annoying monophonic dubbed soundtrack. This DVD release does not do justice to this Italian cinematographic jewel. It should not be in the market. Perhaps it is best to visit Italy, buy its PAL version and play it back in one of today's fine multi region DVD players. Don't spend a penny on this monstruosity."
2,"Don't look for a bargin,buy the No Shame release.","Not paying attention to the reviews, I purchased the Entertainment Programs International release of Yesterday today and tomorrow. This is a classic of Italian cinema. Well worth owning for any fans of european cinema. I am however not impressed with this transfer and urge buyers to look to the widescreen, No Shame release. I own boccaccio '70 (another Italian classic) from No Shame And it has excellent audio and video quality."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD...,"It is tragic to see that such a great Sophia Loren flick has beenreduced to this awful transfer on DVD.Don't buy this DVD, the picture quality is so bad that the entiremovie is out of focus, fuzzy, blurry and hurts your eyes.The sound is all distorted as well.This DVD is from a company called Entertainment Programs Inc., in California and they have obviously transfered a pan/scan version of a really bad washed out VHS tape on this DVD.The Picture and the sound quality is worst than a VHS tape recorded in slow mode. I am surprised that Amazon is actually selling this junk.This is the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen.I have a VHS version of this movie and the VHS tape is muchbetter. Hope some reliable company will transfer this gem of a movie on a real high quality DVD, in the meantime save your money and watch your VHS tape. Don't buy this DVD, it is really badquality."
2,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION,"Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty."
1,Wow. Terrible DVD.,"This DVD is insultingly bad. You can only watch the movie dubbed in English. It's 2008, yet this manages to be worse than some of the DVDs I bought back in 1998 when I bought my first DVD player. I don't need a 4 disc extravaganza for every movie, but at least give people the option of watching the movie in its original language. Find any other way to watch this movie that doesn't involve this atrocious DVD."
1,Poor,"Films are good early Sophia but the DVD quality is terrible. Hesitation, washed-out color, unpredictable pauses and flashing color pixels make for poor viewing pleasure"
3,Poor quality video,"Be warned, this video has extremely poor video quality. The colors are mainly muted browns. It is a print of a projected film with all of the defects of a worn out film. I was very disappointed with this copy of these entertaining films. The stories are as good as ever, I just wish I had found a good copy of them."
2,sophia loren short changed.,"I JUST RECIEVED THIS DVD TODAY FROM AMAZON, WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH SOPHIA LOREN DVD. FIRSTLY IT IS EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY,VISUALLY AND SOUND. ITS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AMERICAN MOVIE, AND ITS AN ITALIAN THREE SHORT FILMS WHICH SOPHIA LOREN STARRED IN. THOUGH SOPHIA IS AT HER COMICAL BEST, THE PICTURE QUALITY , NO SHARP TECHICOLOUR HERE,OR SOUND. THE FIRST FILM IS FUNNILY BUT YOU HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR SAYING. I HAVENT SEEN ANY OF HER FOREIGN MOVIES SHE MADE, UNLIKE HER AMERICAN PICTURES, WHICH ARE EXCELLENT QUALITY, AND PERFORMANCE. THIS DVD HAS DIFFERENTLY SHORT CHANGED SOPHIA LOREN. BIG WASTE OF MONEY.CANT GO WRONG WITH AMERICAN SOPHIA MOVIES, BUT BE CAREFUL WITH HER FOREIGN ONES."
3,Sophia times three,"This DVD is unusual in that it contains three separate and unrelated stories. Sophia is, was and always will be an icon of the cinema. Her looks have not faded as have those of so many others. She is almost timeless. I would not rate this particular DVD as amongst her best work, but it is worth watching. Marcello Mastroianni is also a legendary performer."
2,not worth the money,"Arrived with cracked lid. Cooler has thin walls and is easily broken. For those of you who are old enough, it is like the disposable coolers you used to pick up at the grocery store when heading out to the beach or a concert, only this one costs much much more. I ordered a replacement becaue I had no choice, but know what is coming. Not good value, but hopefully not broken, yet."
2,size,I bought this to replace a different cooler that was about to wear out. I had a basket made to fit inside the old one. I measured to basket to make certain it would fit. By the demensions given it should have fit easily. However the given demensions were for the very top and the basket does not fit.
1,Surprisingly Unoriginal Schlock,"Not one original idea! Which is the biggest shock, since this was written by David Webb Peoples, the on responsible for Blade Runner, 12 Monkies and Unforgiven. Here he is trying to cross the Sci-Fi genre with the Western genre and comes up with a boring knock off of every movie in those genres. And what should have made up in unorginal ideas in the script should have been the action scenes. But yet another surprise happens. These action scenes are no good, even boring. The surprise being that the movie was also directed by Paul Anderson, who directed the fun martial arts film Mortal Kombat, which was supported by it's incredible martial arts scenes. Produced by Jerry Weintraub's JW Productions, which also produced The Avengers, and like The Avengers, Soldier had everything going for it, and just collapsed by it's lack of originality."
2,"Dumb As Hell , But Watchable","Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at. Everything about this film is familiar. The plot is basically Escape From New York meets The Road Warrior. Russell and Busey deserve better than this. The action is a joke, and the acting is hilarious. Just watch this to laugh."
2,"Kurt Russel fights the good fight, says 2 words in movie.","The plot and content of the movie was very origional and different, and the director had a interesting way of showing scenes which was out of the ordinary. Kurt Russel says all of seemingly 2 or 3 words the whole movie ""yes sir"" and ""No sir"". Wow, that really exictes me. Dont ask me why they thought that having Kurt Russel practically mute and socially completely retarded would make the movie more entertaining. I would have thought it would have been cool if he learned how to get along with everyone and actually start to speak at one point, but I was let down cause this never happened. The action in the film was exciting and different, but the movie ended and I was like ""Thats it? "" Its a movie to rent, not to buy."
2,"Well, lots of guns and gore do not a movie make...","Well, the previous reviewer,I categorically disagree with you: if actions speak louder than words, let's make a mute movie! True, there are moments in the movie (in its first half), when Soldier's terse behaviour arises pity in the viewer, for this is the man robbed of normal human behaviour, who can't even name the feelings that rack him. And curse the ones that created him such. However, when they pictured a flashback into the past when Soldier kills a child, my sympathy evaporated for good, and no other cheezy scenes of him saving and holding children could not save him.To make things even worse, when the ""bad gyus"" landed on the planet, I went to ""fast forward"": guess who smashed and routed two dozens of ""death machines"", regained support of his demoted comrades and blasted the whole planet with a nuclear bomb without uttering five words in a row? If it comes to that, I'd better watch an old copy of Rambo..."
3,"Ugh, this old theme again?","...Anyway, I would call this movie mediocre. Okay plot, but nothing to expansive. The acting is okay, but over emotional and predictable. The plotline in particular is very predictable. From the moment Kurt Russell falls off the rope wall fight event, with his opponent, whom he scars, you know that you will see his scarred opponent again elsewhere in the movie. The movie's main villain, a westpoint snob, is like a Snidley Whiplash ripoff, with a weapon wielding Dudley Do-right ...The action is decent, but the usual predictable implications of honor, and veiled morals are evident.In short nothing special. Seen a million others just like it."
3,Soldier,"Kurt Russell is good as a future solder in a special unit. When the new improved versions are introduced his years of experience almost kills one of them but him and two others are killed and left on a dump planet. The only problem is Kurt wasn't quite dead yet. Some survivors of a ship crash that has lived there for years nurse him back to health. Although he was raised to have no feelings and be the best soldier he could be he develops a liking for these civilians. So much so when the improved versions do an Op on the planet and anyone there is considered hostiles, he defends the civilians. Good action movie if you enjoy movies like ""No Escape"" and ""Universal Soldier"". Good quality DVD and fair replayability. - C. Luster"
3,Blade Runner 2,"One aspect of ""Soldier"" that a lot of people miss is the fact that the story is set in the same universe as ""Blade Runner"". For instance, Tanhauser Gate gate is mentioned. This was the same battle in which the replicant Roy Batty fought in. In addition, when Kurt Russell arrives on the waste planet, you can see a discarded spinner vehicle in the background. Very cool. As the colonel says something about DNA recombination, I would assume that the replacement soldiers are replicants as well."
4,Good sci fi,"I thought this was an OK developement of a short story scifi idea. Kurt Russel didn't have to work his way through sonnets (which seems to be the main critism) he played the part to fit the role perfectly. I think if you look at this as a story, rather than a vehicle for actors, it's really very good."
4,Kurt Russell does it all with his face.,"As much as I like the storyline, what makes this film is the fine job Kurt Russell does with only a half-dozen or so lines. It is the lines on his face that convey what is going on inside this charactor whose only feelings are ""fear and discipline"". This is a terrific story of awakening humanity in an individual deprived from birth of such things, and some of the best scenes are between Russell and Connie Nelson's character as he tries to fit into the frightening world of normal life. I knocked off a couple of stars for ""borrowed"" plot lines from similar-themed films, and gave one back for Russell's fine performance."
5,5 Star Soldier,"This movie is a must for every action fan.The DVD contains a perfect video- and audio transfer + some nice extras. Kurt Russell did a great job. He must trained so hard to come in superb shape for that movie.I think he is a great actor and shows the audience that there is still hope and love in that destroyed character ""Todd"", not with words but with mime."
3,Good Action; Simple Plot,"Well, it ain't no terminator but there is pretty good special effects and good action. Kurt says maybe 50 words throughout the whole movie but he certainly did bulk up for the role. Worth renting."
3,Realistic... But need MORE 'surprising' action stunts!,"Kurt Russel plays the 'old-fashioned, obsolete' soldier whose squad got 'replaced' by a better team. And towards the end, he alone, single-handedly, down-ed the whole 'other' squad before setting course for refuge, at the Trinity Moons.Being a fan of science-fiction movies, i might be biased in saying that this is a good movie to spend your weekend watching.However, much of what's portrayed in the movie, i believe is already in practice in the military workforce. So much for the 'tough-guys' thang ! :p"
4,Soldier,Had this in video and wore it out. Loved the premis and concept. Russell is no slouch eitherI gave this as a gift.XC
5,Kurt did a great job,"Personally, I think that the lack of lines for Kurt enhanced this brilliant movie. The music of Loreena Mckennit is beautiful."
3,Entertaining,It's a B+ movie that doesn't rise to greatness but is much better thanaverage SF mostly due to Kurt Russell.
1,Poor plot and script cannot be made up for by special effect,A big disappointment for anyone but the most die hard Science Fiction and/or Kurt Russell fans. Take out the action & special effects and there is nothing left to see.
3,could'a been great.....,"Kurt Russels performance was way more deserving than the B movie budget that backed this film. Same thing with Snake Plissken, a great character stuck in a low budget movie...I loved the concept and again Russell's performance was outstanding, but I have a bit of a problem with generic set pieces and low budget explosions. It kinda picked up for the big finish but still has that 'made for cable' look to it. Darn shame."
2,Whiz Bang Ending But it misses the mark.,"Well after watching a wonderfully violent, strangely poetic ending I found myself liking this film alot more than I did the first hour into it. They try to make us like the main character who has no personality and they try to make us care for the community he falls into, but the film is so full of cliches and poor characterization that the first hour meanders and the ending though fun and exciting , a bit more hollow than I'd like."
5,it's about something else,"Here's another movie that was marketed to the wrong audience and therefore died at the box office.I found Soldier to be a profound meditation on violence and beauty. Kurt Russell delivers yet another exemplary-but-unacclaimed performance. His Sgt. Todd is an Everyman who does his duty, no questions, and is tossed out with the rest of the garbage when the next new thing comes along.From that point, Russell's facial expressions combine with the sensuous camerawork of the cinematographer to provoke the questions: Do I deserve love, beauty, and community? and: When, if ever, is violence necessary?This is a flick I'd recommend to the content guardians who are knee-jerk haters of violence. Soldier uses violence appropriately, intelligently. It is a film for grown-ups. Then again, censors rarely get that point.Bottom line: When you watch this film, you have to watch everything that is going on. It's not just another action flick."
5,Whens the sequal,"I cant imagine why anyone wouldnt like this movie. I recently discovered it didnt do well in the box ofice. that was a surprise to me, I've liked this movie since the first time i saw it on TV and I think with creativity a sequal could be made. If you agree say this review was helpful to you."
5,Aha!,"I saw this film years ago. What got me about the character is his pent-up emotions.We soldiers all have feelings and sometimes we cry. ""Soldier"" kicks ass!"
4,Great Flick,"This movie proves without any doubt, that New, is NOT always Better! Kurt is an Old School Soldier, Talk is cheap, this Sgt. knows his enemy and takes the fight to Him!"
3,Mediocre action fare,"The Bottom Line:Soldier, a ""side-quel"" to Blade Runner that should in no way be considered in the same league with that far more visually inventive film, has nothing to recommend it aside from a cool fight scene fought on chains suspended from the ceiling (imagine climbing the rope in gym class...then ripping out the eye of the guy climbing on the adjacent rope) and the fact that it moves reasonably quickly and could be a lot worse; don't look for anything approaching creativity and you might have an okay time.2/4"
4,"great,but a little pale","this movie is pretty cool,it has good action,violence wich keeps you watching it.one thing i didn't like was the lame story about todd getting trashed,the movie in a way was pale,but still cool."
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,Kurt was pulling a arnold job. I think he had about two lines of dialoge through out the intire movie. The story is pretty good.I'm sorry I purchased it. Should have rented it first.
1,Not worth the room in a dirty garbage can,Avoid this movie like you would encountering a dog foaming at the mouth: stay away- stay far away- you have been warned.
1,Please stay away,"I'm sorry but I feel the need to protect the general public from this movie. Bad story, Bad acting, Bad action. Just bad. Don't waste your time."
1,Non-starter,"I can't believe anyone could enjoy this film, theres nothing there to enjoy. The storyline is virtually non-existent, the acting minimal, dialog.... what dialog ? I think Russell must only say about 10 words total in the whole film.If you like pyrotechnics then you'll like this film, otherwise avoid at all costs. Absolutely dire."
1,Did Ed Wood directed this movie?,"Down below you 'll see the commentery of my comerade Tevfik with whom we 've seen this movie together. He already talked about how funny it was to see a very bad movie.I consider this movie as the worst i 've ever seen in my life . The movie doesnt mean any thing and it doesnt have any good points. Some movies have good points and bad points , you can say the script was very bad but special fx saved the day. But it is not like this at Soldier. You can see better sepecial effects while playing Atari version of Moonpatrol.I generally like Russle's acting but in that movie there was nothing to act i think Kurt was unnecessery for the movie a good crafted wood would do the trick.I hope they stop making that bad movies ... And i cannot finish without prpmpting my best regards to Ed Wood . He was a great man . Thanks to him for inspiring the producers of that film."
1,total junk!!!,"This movie was so bad, I regret even watching it on TV.Don't your money on a movie that is SO bad! It's one of Kurts trashy films (like escape from N.Y.)."
3,An Average Sci Fi Action Movie,"I love sci fi action movies. Totall Recall, Demolition Man, Judge Dredd, the list goes on. Soldier is no different.The movie itself is nothing special, soldiers are raised from childhood to be tough. Kurt Russell though is good. I used to like it when the tough guy made smart ass comments, but now it is way overdone. I loved how he said so little, yet his face could tell it all. When he did speak during the film it made it all that more powerful and important.I hate snap cases, and this DVD has one. The extra features are good though. I loved the commentary by Paul Anderson. The trailer is funny though. Take a look at it and it looks like an entirely different sci fi movie ala Starship Troopers or something. The rest of the extras are text stuff which I dislike, I'd rather just read it on the internet."
3,Much Maligned Film Deserves to Be Seen,"Critically smashed at the time and DOA at the box office, Soldier was one a huge run of mega budgeted flops Warner Bros released in 1997 & 1998. But the suprise is how good this by the numbers sci-fi actioner really is.Kurt Russell gives one of his most phenomenal performances as the emotionally stunted lead character. It's a true tour de force of cinematic acting-he hardly says a word, but his eyes, expression and body language surge through the screen.Paul WS Anderson's direction is efficient and tight, it's more his approach to the the look and feel of the material that's the problem. David Webb People's script is terrific and you can't help but wonder what Ridley Scott or John McTiernan might have be able to do with this.This is kind of an 80's throwback that you could imagine being an absolute blockbuster for Schwarzenegger in his prime- but it's 10 years too late, despite the brilliant work of it's star."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"This has to be one of the worst sci-fi movies of all time and definitely the worst movie Kurt Russel has ever done. A total waste of time.The genetically-bred/robot soldier story has become so cliche and overdone that it would now take a lot more imagination for such a film to be good than what this trash has to offer. Kurt Russel doesn't really act in this movie as he has an even smaller script than Schwarzenneger had in ""Terminator."" In terms of quality, ""Escape From New York"" would really be Oscar material in light of this garbage.The story is utterly predictable and the action is weak. Terrible film. Don't believe the great reviews for this movie and save yourselves both money and time."
2,'Science' Fiction it's not....,"The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society. Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise. The plot was adequate.The acting was believable - no complaints there. I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'. And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.But what ruined the movie for me was the science. I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies. And I realize that movies are not 'real'. But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie. My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night. It spoiled the whole movie for me."
2,El Sucko!,"I am a big fan of Kurt Russell but this movie sucks. And as Forrest Gump said, ""thats all I have to say about that."""
1,It doesn't get much worse than this!,"You know when you're sitting around on a Saturday afternoon, and some pathetically terrible, 1980's sci-fi movie comes on and it's SO bad that you end up watching it all? That's exactly what happened to me with Soldier, but this movie was made in 1998!!This is the kind of movie, acting, and directing that gives sci-fi a bad name outside a few franchises, and ensures we don't get much in the way of original movies. Kurt Russell packs wide-eyed looks into the camera as a substitute for acting; the director uses generic music and sudden and *dramatic* slow-motion shots to add 'feeling' to the movie. The world is eternally dark and gloomy, only lit by the constant over-bright fires.Kurt Russell is too big a name for this movie, and none of the other parts are done any justice by the terrible acting.One of the worst movies I've seen in a LONG time! Ranks up there with Battlefield Earth and Lost in Space."
1,abysmal,"If you are going to make a film in someone's back yard, at least there should be some gripping dialog or novel character development. This film was horrendously bad, trotting out all the scifi and action movie clichés, without adding anything to them. Russell's macho posing can't hide the utter lack of thought that goes into his character. This movie was made on a shoestring to take advantage of people (like me) who are stupid enough to see anything that smacks of scifi and action. No more."
5,Wow,"This movie is a must-see. I have never seen acting this good.In writing, people say ""show, don't tell,"" meaning that it is better to describe a person's emotional state through actions (so-and-so clenched his fist and his jaw bunched tensely) rather than just saying it (so-and-so was angry).Kurt Russell's perfomance took this to heart. Without hardly any words to ""tell"" his emotions, he conveyed them beautifully through subtle actions. I especially like that little head tilt at the end when he--to the astonishment of his fellow soldiers--picked up the little boy. Such a tiny motion, yet it said it all.This is a movie I will watch again many times and enjoy it no matter how often I have already seen it."
5,Soldier,"An inspired and authentic Science Fiction movie. Trust me, if you don't like it, then you haven't managed to grasp even the most basic subtlety of the film - perhaps you should try something a bit less intelligent like Star Wars."
2,Suspension of disbelief is difficult,"Good Kurt Russell. Interesting conflict setup. This would make an excellent story if explored better, but there are inconsistencies in nearly everything. In retrospect I should have just watched ""Escape from New York"" again."
3,"Better than Stallone, still falls short of Schwarzenegger...","Nice idea that seems to be missing something. One of Russell's better movies, due to his lack of actual dialogue. There's still a little life in his waning career. Character typecasting is way overdone. The movie will NOT appeal to a multitude of groups; automatic to fans of Starship Troopers and Schwarzenegger's futuristic flix. Worth the money to rent, but not full theatre admission price."
4,The last half-hour boosted it up 2 Stars.,"A very promising idea is not fully realized in Soldier. It opens exceptionaly and is looking extremely promising, but then Kurt Russel lands on the trash planet and he starts becoming more human, which takes far too long. Russels charactor Todd speaks less than his Snake Plissken charactor and he is pretty uninteresting. But then in the Last Half-hour Action takes over and there is a full-on violent on-slaught which makes you forget all the films flaws. Acting is credible and the set designs are great. Paul Anderson has proved with Soldier and Event Horizen that he knows what he is doing when it comes to Sci-Fi. All around.. It's no classic, but the last half hour is reason enough to buy it. Plus.. It has Kurt Russel."
4,Really liked the idea behind the film,"First of all, I like most things militaristic. This movie is sort of inspiring to the military types; with Kurt Russells utter lack of visible emotion and stringent discipline. Perfect! It is what every truelly dedicated soldier/sailor/sniper/grunt would LOVE to achieve. The only thing that I feel keeps the film from being in the five star catagory is just a couple of things. I would have liked to see more of the childhood. Maybe a touch of inner dialog from Todd. And then towards the end...wish I could know what happened to the colonists and the soldiers. Wanting to know these little details is what promoted my interest in the film to the point that I wondered if the movie was based on a Sci-fi book of some kind. If anyone is aware of a written version of this film I would certainly like to know."
1,Disappointment! Pugster- Unacceptable Customer Service!,"The 3 charms I ordered from Pugster could be described in a word, disappointing. The items were not as they appeared. They were much smaller, the graphics very poor.When I attempted to send the charms back I was directed to a very time and energy intensive process to return the charms. At one point in the return process, I did not receive return emails or phone calls after 4 attempts to contact Pugster?Needless to say, I will not be ordering from Pugster in the near or distant future."
5,The Stressless Home,This book revolutionized how I managed my home with four children and their many needs. The tools it offers for prioritizing tasks and helping us sort through what was really important was invaluable. It saved my sanity!
3,Buber...on Buber...on You,"Classic Buber...insightful, introspective...a good read...you wil learn a lot about Buber...and if you think about it...soemthing about yourself."
4,very engrossing,"I would give this a 4.5 because hardly anything is a ""5"" for me. Almost every page was engrossing. There were only a few sections that I skimmed through fast - but that's probably because I have a 3 year old with little time to read. I very much enjoyed the writing style. You really feel part of what is happening in the book. It's gritty stuff, but very engrossing and enlightening. I am looking forward to the sequel. I understand there will be 3 total."
5,great book,It starts off good then gets even more engrossing as you get to know Toomer better. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to meet the author at the local bookstore and coffee shop in San Pedro when he visits in November to find out how much is based on fact. The style is such that you really feel like Toomer is actually writing the story. The slang that he uses and problems that he comes up against are so real. It was sad to turn the page and get to the end.
5,"Sad, yet emotionally uplifting tale of inner city life","I happen to read a chapter of this book in an brochure from Doubleday and decided to test my interest in novels about minorities and gangs (I'm intially from small town midwest). Wow, what a blast of truth and a fresh new realization about everday life in south central Los Angeles. Toomer, narrator and main character, lives a life and experiences things everyday that most people could never deal with. I never expected a book that deals with all the bad things about inner city life to focus on the little bits of happiness and joy that its inhabitants find and turn those bits into something much bigger and more meaningful. I laughed, cried, and did not want the book to end."
4,Simplifies Programming Insteon dimmers,"This controller connects to your laptop or computer via USB and makes it easy to program all of the Insteon devices in your house (with additional software). Without this device, you can set some of the dimmer options manually, but I found it confusing and sometimes my changes didn't seem to take. To cross-link one dimmer to another, you have to set one up to listen, then run to the other one to talk; a lot of running back and forth.This device, along with the ""Homelinc"" software (there are other packages available) discovers new devices, allows you to set ramp rates and on-levels for each dimmer, allows you to cross-link one dimmer to another, tests dimmer controls, saves backups of your entire configuration, and can control all lighting from the computer, either immediately or by a schedule. That's a nice feature that can cost thousands in a custom home solution!"
2,Lack of information,Falta de informacion de el hardware y software hay que dedicarle mucho tiempo para un funcionamiento regular es mas sencillo el uso de x10
2,Turns lights on by its own schedule,I use one of these to set timers for a couple of lights and it works fine for that however it also decides to turn on the lights during the day and no matter how many times I download timers it doesn't fix.
1,Returning this one,"First off, the lights aren't bright enough. Second, the fan is too loud. Third, and the reason why I'm returning it, the magnetron blew out after 2 months of lite use. Luckily, Home Depot will still let me return it, because Maytag will repair it but they won't replace it."
5,A Hit CD,"This is one of the best Crystal CD because it includes songs from all of Crystal's previous labels (Liberty, Columbia, and Warner Brothers). In most cases, labels never combine songs that were recorded under another label. That is the reason that most artists have more than one greatest hits cd. Additionally, this cd includes many songs that were not singles, but some that I always felt should have been released as a single (specifically, Aint No Love In The Heart of the City, Same Old Story (Same Old Song), Let Your Feelings Show, and After The Best, which I think can compete with any country song currently out there)."
3,A Change in Style,"I have been a long time Cryatal Gayle fan. Her voice is extremely pleasing and she has put a definite touch on what she has done.This collection to me represents an unfortunate turn to a lounge singing style.If you are familiar with ""Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,"" - the original, the version in this collection is faster, lacks some instrumentation due to a poor job of remastering another version that is faster in tempo. As B.B. sang ""The Thrill is Gone,"" it is apropo to this collection. The Original version of this is the best."
4,Excellent Home Schooling (or any schooling) Viking Story,"I bought this book as part of a home schooling curriculum for my ten-year-old son. Although the book is recommended for young adults, my son reads on a much higher grade level than most of his age group. That being said, he still wanted this to be a duet read;I would read for a while, then he would. It's a challenging read, but well worth the effort. We had been studying Vikings in our history lessons, and I chose this book as the companion reading for these lessons. It really brought home the tumultuous, often violent, and complex times of the Viking world. I highly recommend it."
4,the Shop Around the Corner,"I tried throughout NOT to compare ""You've Got Mail"" with this movie. To me the remake ""You've Got Mail"" is a great movie. It's funny, light & totally romantic.However, ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is different. It is interesting as one reviewer said that it takes place in Poland, but only one or two have accents. Good story line, great performances by supporting cast and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart? Everything he did was always top notch! Morgan puts out a great performance in this movie, sad & rejected! I don't want to say too much & give away the plot.I thought maybe this would be more in line with the remake & about a book store!Still a good wholesome movie & good performances by all! Recognized many faces in this movie."
4,Mistaken Identity,"I believe some folks may be mistaken about the premise of ""You've Got Mail."" It was my impression that it was not a remake of ""Shop Around the Corner"" but more of a continuation. Meg Ryan was the daughter of the woman who owned the shop in the original and Tom Hanks' grandfather used to date her. Perhaps they were the original characters. These two movies shouldn't so much be compared for inconsistencies as rated on their own individual merits. My only complaint about the original is why was it set in Budapest?"
4,Great story,"The Shop Around the Corner is a delightful ""classic"" movie, fun, upbeat, and nostalgic. Even though the plot is fairly predictable, the characters are witty and charming, drawing the viewer into an era in which people valued right over wrong rather than political correctness. The takeoff from this movie ""You've Got Mail"" utilizes only the basic plot as the skeleton and softens the characters' reactions to each other. We enjoy both movies and consider ""The Shop Around the Corner"" a welcome addition to our video library."
5,Great filmmaking,"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is a wonderful movie, and lends credence to the argument that they just don't make 'em like they used to (""you've got mail"" can't hold a candle)The director, Ernst Lubitsch, uses his effortlessly witty story-telling and well placed plants for plot points to carry along the viewer. The movie constantly seems to play into your expectations and then swerve into something even better. The cast does a great job in all the roles. Essential to own for all fans of romantic comedy, Stewart, Sullivan and especially Lubitsch."
4,Wonderfully understated Lubitsch,"Other than wanting to kick Margaret Sullavan in the teeth now and then for her arrogance and presumption (a reaction I think much-intended), I thought this softly played romance was excellent. Jimmy Stewart is perfect as the store employee craving love and intellectual depth, Margaret Sullavan is the lovelorn shrew with a beautiful soul, and most of all, Frank Morgan puts in the performance of his life as the belligerent but sensitive store owner suddenly confronted by betrayal and his own tragic mistakes. The real magic is that Lubitsch has told a bittersweet story with a light touch and such tender humor that no one can come away brutalized by scenes of jilted love and attempted suicide. It's a movie meant for rejoicing."
5,The original classic,How could you not like a James Stewart film. If you like You've got Mail I highly recommend this movie. It's fun to see how the original story unfolds.
4,....,"After a long search of not being able to find this film anywhere in retail stores, I decided to search here. My mom and I really enjoyed this movie. The movie was a great price and the delivery was fast."
3,She's no Meg Ryan,"This is the original, later remade into ""You've Got Mail"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Jimmy Stewart gives a sensative performance worth seeing, but Margaret Sullivan is no Meg Ryan. Her performance is melodramatic by today's standards although not an unusual style for her time. In addition, her character lacks empathy with Stewart's, a depth that the remake has managed to achieve nicely. If you loved ""You've Got Mail"" it's worth at least seeing, if not owning, a copy of ""The Shop Around the Corner."""
2,Shop Around The Corner,"Same story line as In The Good Old Summertime movie. Jimmie Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are the best combination in this movie.Two employees of the same shop have a romance by letter writing through the mail, In the end they find out they are writing to each other. Cute, cute movie."
2,NOT FOR ME,"BOUGHT FOR MY SISTER AT HER REQUEST. SHE LOVES 'YOU'VE GOT MAIL' AND THOUGHT SINCE IT WAS BASED ON THIS MUCH EARLIER VERSION THAT SHE WOULD LIKE IT. SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN 'THEN AND NOW' IN FILMS. WE ARE SPOILED TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES AND ACTORS."
2,Shop Aroun The Corner,"This was the original black and white movie starring Jimmy Stewart on which the Toom Hanks / Meg ryan movie ""You've Got Mail"" was based -- that's why we bought it. I thought it was just too old to be really interesting as so much of it was no longer plausible"
5,"Great Anytime, Not Just for Christmas!",This is a wonderful charming movie about two coworkers who can't stand each other but they each don't know they are penpals and each can't wait to get each others penpal letters. This was remade into a musical starring Judy Garland (Don't know the title) and than the movie You've Got mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Both James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are wonderful in this movie and they had great chemistry together and whoever first thought of casting these two together is a genious! This romantic movie has some comedy in it but there is also drama so it's not one of those screwball comedies that is filled with slapstick. I just watched this movie for the first time this summer and even though some of the movie takes place around Christmas I don't think it's considered to strictly be a Christmas movie so I think it really can be watched anytime of the year and is very highly recommended!
5,Charming no matter how many times I have seen it,There have been other takeoffs of this theme in later days but noone makes this so real and believable as the two stars. Margaret sullavan's throaty voice captivates and holds your attention at all times.
5,Excellent espresso machine,"I am Italian and if I tell you that this is a very very good espresso machine you must believe me! If you are not familiaron how to make an espresso, read the instruction (which are very clear and usefull) and you will be a master on the art of making espresso."
2,Fake widescreen!,"While this 2003 version is better color corrected and clearer than the full screen 1999 dvd release, it is just hacked off the top and bottom. (same studio too ""omega"") Like so many hammer films, they take all the trouble to clean up the image, but then put black masking over it and sell it as ""wide screen"". A big waste. All modern wide tv's have a zoom feature that allows you to watch 4x3 video in 16x9 if you wish. The only way to see all the nice tidbits (especialy actress wardrobe malfunctions etc) is to view a full screen version. (dvd releases that are especialy bad about this are; ""1 million years bc"" with Raquel Welch, and ""Vampire lovers"" with Madeline Smith. 2 good releases are, ""embrace of the vampire"" (alyssa milano) and ""Two Moon Junction"" (sherilyn fenn). They have both versions on the disk. Though like I said, black masking is worse than useless. The up shot is that there is still no good dvd release of this little gem of a movie. Too bad."
4,"Low-budget yet very effective, forgotten thriller","This is a neat little suspense film. Meg Foster (The Stepfather 2) plays a writer named Sian Anderson who takes a trip to a deserted village in Greece to write her next novel. Wings Hauser plays the deranged handyman who begins to stalk her in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. The low budget and production values betray The Wind because it is a very unique, engaging thriller. The isolation and spooky atmosphere full of high winds are the films biggest strengths. The Wind is a film that can easily be watched repeatedly because of it's high entertainment value. You may also recognize Robert Morley in a supporting role who likes to refer to Sian as ""dear girl."" I am glad this film made it's way to DVD. I remember watching it as a child and never forgetting it. It's a fun thrill ride for a quiet evening at home."
1,Do not waste your time with this book!!,"I usually take recommendations from friends about books or make sure I get a credible review before I invest the time in reading a book. I did not do that in the case of Every Sunday. This book was horrible from every angle. The characters were stereotypical, one dimensional at best, the dialogue was childish and the plot a complete and utter joke. To be brief: Before the older father dies, he tells his son to say goodbye to his long time mistress. Turns out the son meets and falls for the mistress after they meet. The mistress is a professor at Brown University. The son is an uneducated goombah with gold chains around his neck who runs his dead father's hardware store. The son's big claim to fame is he knows someone at the parking violations bureau to get your parking tickets expunged. You couldn't make up a dumber plot. And have I mentioned how weak the writing was? Unless you want to laugh at how bad a published book can be, stay from away from this trash."
1,Don't waste your time,"On the premise, this sounded like a great easy read. This has got to be one of the worst books I have read. The plot was predictable. The writing was amateur. There was no substance. I didn't even finish the book. I didn't care to see how it ends. The one time I don't check reviews. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,ONE WORD SAYS IT ALL,"This book can be reviewed in one word 'INSIPID"".Life is too short to be spent reading dull storiesabout adult characters who behave like adolescentsand a storyline that is better suited to a 40'swomens magazine like ""True Confessions"". Thewriting is amateurish, the story boring.If what you crave is a novel about folks you canempathize with and whose lives you really care aboutyou'd be much better off investing your hoursin reading Evening Class or Tara Road(both by Maeve Binchy). Both are easy, enjoyable reads."
3,"Tough design, weak performance","These metal alloy earphones look unique and help you to stand out from the crowd. However, they are no better than the Coby earphones that came with my player. The stems are very thin and slippery making it unnatural feeling when trying to put them on. Once you get them on you will be startled by the chilly sensation from the metal (depending on the ambient temperature of course). Sound quality is on the low side and thin sounding. Bass was not warm or punchy, and highs not soaring and sparkling. An unfortunate example of form over function."
4,Suprisingly Good,I can't do the in-ear headphones so I searched for something in this style. There aren't too many choices so I was willing to settle a little. These headphones surprised me. They sound very crisp and detailed and seem very well made. The bass response is a little restrained even with the iPod EQ adjusted but that is my only complaint. The accessories are a nice bonus at this price.
2,Good as regular earphones but not for phone.,"I bought these headphones because i thought they were a 2.5mm headphones that i could use with my cellphone. It's a 3.5 mm headphone that comes with a 2.5mm adaptor.When I tried it out with my cellphone, music only came out of one ear since it isn't a ""stero"" adaptor.The sound was good, but it didn't fit well in my ears.It did come with a lot of accessories, but I'm dissapointed that it doesn't really work it a cellphone. Whenever I plugged it in, my phone recognized it as a microphone/earphone headset and went to voice command each time - even though there is no microphone on this since they are earphones.So, if you're looking to buy this as regular headphones, they're decent.. But if you want them for your cellphone... look elsewhere."
1,Ouch!... hey this song is cool!... Ouch!,"Eeeee... Kindda-ok. But naaa... shouldn't recommend them.Ever wanted to look cool but be hurting and pretend like your just feeling suave?Well these earphones do exactly that. You'll look cool but your ears will hurt like if you'd be wearing new shinny shoes 2 sizes smaller than your feet.Could they have not put a little cushion to these very heavy earphones?I mean, so you don't have to feel like ""metal tubes"" are sticking and hanging out of your ears.Although the sound is ok; I don't think the engineers had any ""comfort factor"" considered in the equation. The ear pieces are very hard and heavy (dudes it's just hard metal all around.) That black ring you see in the picture is super hard rubber heck it could almost be ceramic for all I care, and your ears don't appreciate the intruding material in your outer ear canal.I just wouldn't recommend them... Wait! You can put duct tape around the black ring for a little extra comfort! AND it would look even cooler!"
2,Fell apart,"The sound and fit are fine and I do like the cable length. However, after four months the left bud fell apart. The rubber gasket came loose then finally fell off and I can't get it to stay on. Sure, I can replace them because of the warranty but do I really want to bother with another of these? I'm going back to the Apple buds."
2,"too much treble, not enough base",I am not sure I like the sound out of these headphones. The base is a bit weak and they have a very high piched treble that hurts my head/ears.
4,Well Worth While,"Music is great throughout, worth watching for that alone. The idea of cowboys in space goes back aways of course. I think it's presented very well. The low budget effects, the black and white photography seem appropriate to the theme rather than detracting from it. Lots of very dry humor. Dialog and acting come off very natural, whole thing seems well written. Good, old time serial type plot premise. The only disappointment for me is that the story isn't actually resolved. It simply stops (as the first installment of an old time serial might). I was ready to watch a few more hours."
4,Weird but worthwhile,"While this film is not quite a masterpiece, it deserves a place on the shelf of anyone who likes low budget oddness. However, The American Astronaut is more than just weirdness. It has a story, strange as it may seem, and it has down to earth characters, odd as they may appear on the surface. The FX are nice. Not fancy or impressive, but simple and effective. Not that they're really the point.Astronaut has many strange musical interludes, which just pop up without reason. And the dialogue is often full of intentionally awkward moments. The movie has a leisurely pace, and doesn't rush where it's going. And when it gets there, it doesn't mind stopping with a simple resolution. I recommend renting before buying because it won't be to everyone's taste. But it's a good, unusual film. And I enjoyed it."
2,Not too good.,"But hey, they made a movie. If you go through the process, you deserve a couple of stars. Nice black and white."
4,I Love That Dog!,This book is for people you don't [or do] like poetry. You don't have to love poetry to love this book. This quick read will keep you laughing throughout the entire story! If your in a situation where you just don't want to read something happy I would not reccomend this book. Have fun!
5,Love this book!,This is a fantastic book and a great way to get kids interested in poetry. This book demonstrates how children can explore and express feelings through poetry and learn about themselves in the process. Love That Dog will pull you in and you will not be able to put it down. It is a wonderful story and a MUST read! Adults and children will enjoy this book. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry as we can all identify with Jack at some time in our lives. Thank you Sharon Creech for such a wonderful book!
5,love that book!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Love that book! I said I love that book. For all dog lovers, poetry lovers, and those interested in something truely unique this is a great book. I read it to my grade 3 class and they loved it. The voice of the Jack, the narrator, is so fresh, real and honest. As a result students connect with the poetry of the book. I have read it over and over and it remains at the top of my favourites lists. For adults and students alike."
2,Love That Dog,This book was a very old copy of the book and the pages had turned brown a little. Good book but a little disappointed with quality. Would have at least liked a heads up.
5,Love That Dog,"This book will touch your heart everytime you look at it. I just read it recently with my 6th grade reading class and it touched my heart. I almost cried when his dog got hit by a car. I suggest you read this because it is a book that most of us can relate to,because most of us know someone who has lost a dog to a car,or maybe your that person.Anyway I suggest you read this book."
5,My daughter's favorite book,"My 10 year old daughter does not like to read - she's pretty clear about that. So I'm always looking for books she might like - I gave her this one for her birthday last year, and she read the whole thing in one day, and just loved it. She's always telling me that she'll read more if I can find her another book like this one, but nothing seems to measure up. I highly recommend this book, especially for kids that love dogs, and would be intrigued by the poetry, the funny type changes, and the very real-sounding voice of a kid as the narrator."
5,I Can't Stop Smiling,Love this book. I felt as if I were one with Jack as he blossomed with Miss Stretchberry's gentle urging into the world of poetry. Jack's sheer pleasure in his new-born appreciation of poems read to him by Miss Stretchberry passes right on to the reader. Thank you Sharon Creech. I recommend this feel-good book highly.
5,Love That Book,"Love That Dog is purely awesome!!!I think the main reason I love it is that it appeals to so many different types of people. It can appeal to poetry lovers, since it is written in poems and there are several famous examples at the back. It can appeal to poetry haters, because that is exactly what the ""author"" of the poems, Jack, is- a boy who considers poetry for sissies. It can appeal to teachers, because it gives you some great ideas for classroom studies of poetry. It can appeal to people who are looking for a humorous, touching book that's a quick read.I have read it many times simply because it is so immensely enjoyable.Buy this now- It's cheap, and I really don't think you'll ever regret it!"
5,"It's short, sweet, and can't be beat!",This was a great book. It's written in the form of a poem. The kid in the book does not want to write poetry because boys don't do that. He is in a poetry class though and writes poems about his old dog he used to have named Sky. I finished it in one night and really wanted to write poetry.
3,Good book for teachers,"This book shows us a school child reacting to poetry and slowly finding his own poetic voice. It's a cute book, but the audience it's intended for is a little unclear. I think the book is good for teachers, but although it is written in a format that a child could read, I doubt they would connect with it as well as adults who have more knowledge and perspective."
1,Love that dog,"This story takes place in a boys head writing poetry in the day. He thinks about a blue car speeding down a road saying the car still gets many miles still needs to go before he sleeps.The main characters of the book were Jack, Blue, Yellow dog named Sky it just talked about the day. The main idea was how the dog was and the boy Jack the book described them about how they look and how the boy took care of Sky.I think this book was interesting because what it talk about a blue car and a yellow dog. But it was of for a person that likes poetry cause on every page it was pages. It was a little hard to understand and when you read it changes what it talks about."
4,Britni's Review,"Love that dogBy: Sharon CreechI don't want tobecause boysdon't write poetry.Girls do.The plot of the story in this book was that a boy named Jack who was scared to write poems because boys don't write poetry girls do. With the help of his teacher, pencil and some paper he gets the courage to tell his story. With some twists added in. He even gets to meet his favorite poetry writer when he comes to his school. The genre of this story would by fantasy.I found this book really good because the interesting way the author wrote it by only showing the boys side of the conversation. I would recommend this book to kids able to read all the way up to 14, and people who enjoy fantasy books. This book really made me enjoy the style of writing. I had never read a book with that style of writing. I think anyone who read this book would enjoy reading it. Its not a page turner but there is something about it that made me keep reading."
3,POEMS,"If you want a spectacular book this isn't quit for you. I didnt love this book because it is written in poetry and most of the parts are dull and boring. But it can Also be sad at times. When You think of Love That Dog would you think that it would be mostly about a dog but only half of the book talks about a dog and the other half talks about poems. So I guess this book is half and half but if you like battles and things like, once again this book isn't for you."
5,LOVE that Book,It is perfect for my 7 & 9 year old boys. We read it to each other and we laugh. I read it aloud and they immediately quiet down to listen. What a delicious piece of imagination!
5,Love That Dog,"Love that dog is a great funny poetry book for anyone. This book is a marvelous book. I didn't want to put it down. Its funny every which way. It's a great page-turner. It's poetry but it has lot of talking to the teacher, which is not in a normal poetry book. It leaves you hanging at the end with a bunch of ideas. Did the boy became a famous author? Did he end up working at the dump? Did he became a teacher? Read the book, its great in everyway. You never want to put it down, it's funny, and it's like no ordinary poetry book."
5,A book that grows with the heart!,"Love That Dog by Sharron Creech is one that can touch the heart at any age. I have read this book at least 5 times. The first reading of Love That Dog brought a smile to my face, and the next tears to my eyes. What seems to be the story of a boy and his dog can be interpreted into so much more. I would highly recomend Love That Dog to readers of all ages. Its a book that can heal the heart and bring tears tears to the eyes.-Passion Writer 123"
3,"A Picture of Poems -- a review by Chris, age 10","Love that Dog is about a boy named Jack who had a dog that died, and now he is writing in his poem journal, but he believes that poetry is not for boys. Yeah, right. He writes some beginner's poetry but they are inspired by other professional poetry, and he gets better and more confident at writing poetry throughout the book. He writes poems inspired by the works of Robert Frost, Arnold Adoff and many more.This is a book of humor and poetry, similar to Amelia's Notebook and a Shel Silverstein book combined. The author writes this way because emotions are better expressed in poetry than in prose. It shows young writers how to get ideas inspired by another author. It is a good book for people who like letter books where the whole book is letters. It is for young readers who like poetry. This is a very good book by a very good author."
5,Love That Dog,"This is an excellent book for ""kids"" of all ages. I am 49 and loved it! It is the story of a boy who thought he could not write poetry. My 12 year old niece started me on Sharon Creech books and I have read as many as I could find. ""Love That Dog"" is fun to read and made me feel like a kid again. Buy this book to read yourself or to your kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids....you will enjoy it."
2,love that dog by sharon creech,"love that dog is not that great in all because he just buys a dog then at the end it gets ran over by blue car.I don't like it because it repets the same thing over and over and it gets anoing, like at the end of the book it says that blue blue car speeding down the road road road so fast. That is anoing and boring.If you want to read this book go ahead but if you are board then you shood of have listened to me and not of have read the book. If you like reading boring books than this is the book for you!!"
1,Love That dog,"This story takes place in a boys head writing poetry in the day.

2,I've Seen Better,"Love That Dog by Sharon Creech is written in a poetry form. Normally I would enjoy that type of story, but the poetry was a little dry. The reason I think that is because when I was reading the book I constontly thought of ways to say things that would make the story more interesting without changeing the plotline. If you were to read this book, the story is about a boy who hates poetry. Later his teacher teaches him to enjoy poetry. If you would like to read a book in the format in poetry I would reccomend Witness, by Walter Dean Myers."
1,love that dog,"~*LOVE THAT DOG*~Love that dog is about poems, and only poems. You would think it was about dog, because of the title but its not, I thought it was about dogs so I got it, but its not at all about dogs, It's hard to follow because it's written in poetry writing. It's very boring. And also that it only about hundred pages, and its really easy to read. In conclusion, if you don't like poems then don't check this book out if you do like poems then go ahead."
1,Love That Dog,"Love that dog is nothing about dogs what so ever, and I thought that it was going to be all about dogs. This book is about Poems. I would have never read it if the cover never said Love That Dog. This book is hard to follow because it written in poems and it is really boring and does not interest me at all. I think that if the poems were about dogs then I might have read it?Another things that I thought was that it is are easy to read because it only had 100 pages. Some other things I know about the book is that it switches from poems to poems. I am just trying to let you know that this book is about poems. If you like dogs then this would not be the book for you to read. In conclusion I do not recommend this book unless you like poems."
3,"CAUTION, DOG DIES","Bought this to read with a young person with a sensitive heart, and glad I read it first. The author ruins the fun of the book because the dog dies. OK, I know loss is part of life, but there is such a trend today to make everything so ""realistic"" that warm stories are not warm any more and peaceful thoughts (especially if reading at beadtime) are ruined, that readers should be aware that this book may be disappointing to young children. I loved the idea that it is written very much in poem - good poem. But won't share it. What a shame the author did not think more about this, or if she did, that she decided she needed to include a grisly accident, sadness, and the dog's death in the mix."
4,jack can write poetry,I think this book is okay. You have to read between the lines to fully understand it. Jack thinks only girls write poetry and he can't. Thoughout the book his teacher guides him to be very succsesful. This book almost reminds me of my life.
5,Love that Book!,"It's a charming, delightful, true book about 10 yo boys and poetry. My 10yo boy agrees with most of it (he's not quite as in love with poetry by the end, but he's getting there) I would recommend this to anyone with a child struggling to appreciate poetry but especially to boys. It's so loving and light filled. It's a delightful book and a real treasure. We're keeping it!"
1,The most boring and without the point book EVER,"The poetry was lame and the story told even worse. It was a nice attempt to a poetry story book, but, well lets just say that the author should try better next time."
3,why such a classic?,"I never understood the cult status of this movie. The plot is good and entertaining, but one thing about this movie annoys me - it is supposed to be set in WW1, but the producers have made little or no effort to alter the fashions. People weren`t dressed like that in WW1! Shown is the fashion and ways of 1940. What is the point of making a period piece if you are not sensitive to the changes having occured since the period you want to portray?"
4,a great film,"I bought this film, cause my grandma at 81 years old had seen it in her youth. I got it for her as a gift. She cried when I sat down with her and watched it. I loved it. It' s a romantic film about what can happen in wartime. Great actors and a brilliant plot. I recommend this film."
5,Excellent classic movie,"A love story between a soldier and a ballet dancer torn apart during war time.She gives up her dream as a ballet dancer to try and marry a soldier when they fell in love at first site. They only have a weekend to get thru the red tape of the service and the church to marry before he ships out. Believing that he died in action, not being able to go back to ballet she goes into the unspeakable profession of picking up soldiers at a train station when she believes that she sees her love ......Stopping here since I don't want to give away the rest of the movie. Once you see this movie it'll stay with you."
3,1940 Tearjerker,"Remembered from LONG ago, it still is poignant and indeed a tear producer. I am particularly happy that the ""oldies"" can be found and can be readilty obtained through Amazon's stable of contractors. The disc had a few audio gliches which did not interfere with the sound track. Being in black and white it was a reminder as to how far our Hollywood people had come with color. The screen writers take a few liberties which left me thinking ""How could she/he be so stupid!"" and the story seemed very simplistic. Well acted and definitely cry-over material. Recommended for The Oldest Generation who want to go back to the Forties in early WWII Britain."
3,This Jarreau fan is a little disappointed,"I wanted to love this CD. Really. Al Jarreau's voice is one of my favorites, and I am a sucker for the whole Johnny Mercer era of songwriting, but this CD was a letdown.The music is pleasant enough, and Al's singing is, of course, smooth as velvet. But there's nothing groundbreaking here. There was no song I listened to that made me think, ""Yes! That's way better than the original! Al has really made this song his own."" And I guess as a fan, I had expected more.On the positive side, this recording provides a glimpse into Al's scat style in a controlled setting. Having seen him live, I know that sometimes he gets off on a tangent and it's hard to follow. On these tracks, the scat is lively and fun but not too out there.This wholly inoffensive CD would be a fine choice to play in the background during a dinner party, but for a true Jarreau aficionado, it comes up a little short."
1,A lot of cheap plastic,"It looks nice, it looks metal, but everything but the bar itself is plastic (the shower clip, the knob, and the parts that keep them on the wall). It will break as easily as your cheap waterpik shower, except replacing each part costs more than a whole waterpik showerhead."
4,God's Dietary laws verified by science. DON'T EAT PORK!,"God's Key To Health And Happiness is an excellent book to learn what the bible says about man's diet choices vs God's choices. The first couple chapters are somewhat dry, but necessarily so, as the reader finds out in later chapters. You will never again eat pork after reading the chapter on TRICHINOSIS. Elmer Josephson gives DETAILED reasoning of why science classifies certain meats as unfit to eat.... and why God calls such meats UNCLEAN and an ABOMINATION. Many dietary bible verses explained. Science verifies Gods wisdom again. Man learns the hard way after 2000 years of poor diet choices heart disease and cancers. This book was largely responsible for my conversion to Christianity. Feel free to Email me if you have any comments. I have searched for copies of this book for many years. The ONLY place that has it is AMAZON.COMDavid Michael Mundy"
5,The Key to every door...,"Although it is NOT what we want to hear, Mr. Josephson definitely is speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He reiterates throughout the book that the KEY to our physical health and happiness is obedience to God's Word. Pretty basic. But if you don't want to believe the Bible, then you choose not to receive the key to physical or spiritual health and happiness as given us by God Himself in His Word, the BIBLE.He explains that he is mostly discussing ""physical"" health & happiness...that our spiritual condition is only established through salvation -- forgivenss of sin through Christ's blood. But WOW, he has some really good, though truly basic, insights on what God says about food.Definitely 2 thumbs up!!"
4,How to have great health,"This is a remarkable guide to good health, based on the oldest dietary laws know to man. It is a remarkable study on nutrition and tells what foods are dangerous to man's sytem and reveals how to correctly prepare the foods that are good and healthful to eat. I recommend it for everyone."
5,Food from the Bible,Excellent. Highly recommended. Any one who is interested in this topic needs to read this book. It also has good references. And Amazon delivered it promptly.
5,Recent recipient,"I just recieved ""THE HEART OF THE APPALOOSA"" CD. I haven't heard Fred Small in many years, he use to do concerts at my Church in Chicopee,MA and his songs really make you think about the problems in the world today."
3,Gota love the 90's,I purchased this recently because I had sex 3 times with a girl who claimed she was in this issue. Turns out she wasn't lying. I hope to purchase many more issues as I continue my conquest. The girls name in this issue is Lisa Carr but I will always remember her as puddles.
2,"""The Nightingale""","This is indeed a lovely story and beautiful interpretation...but simply lacks the ""pizzazz"" and ""sizzle"" necessary to capture the attention of today's electronically charged child...too slow moving... such is our digital, electronic world. We need to slow it down, but ""The Nightingale"" is not a part of the solution. The translation of this story from the book to the screen, in this case, does not work as the pages are too similar in artistic content and graphics, they do not add to the story, unfortunately. Glenn Close's narration is soft and soothing, but ultimately becomes ""just words"" as the pace, tempo is too languid.One classroom teacher's opinion only, take it for what it is ... or is not!!"
4,Authour recreates his own life story.,"Neil Albert's ""monthly series"" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do, basicly jobless buy with a job. Until he is presued to find his father, his biological father. He sets out to California where his mother stayed during her pregnancy with her family. He hopes he will be able find the truth there but it leads to nowhere. With a twist of fate and a confession Dave is sent on the right track and you are left with a great mystery."
2,Annoying arrangements,"One of the greatest jazz singers, Sarah Vaughan, was also a great pop-singer, one of the best produced by the USA. However, although some interpretation's on this album are quite acceptable, and some of the material quite intriguing, the arrangements used by Hal Mooney's orchestra are at times really IRRITATING (only a handful of songs is recorded with other orchestras).Even when the emphasis is not on the strings, the music still sounds corny...Just in order to be sure I'm not too strict (being a jazz fan) i gave this album more than one star."
1,A Thing of Beauty - Lost Forever,"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Hedy Lamarr had a body which was absolutely beautiful.One scene in Ecstasy showed her beauty, with full frontal nudity, at the young age of 18. It was included in this movie for all the world to see, and appreciate, forever. However, when I puchased this DVD, that particular scene was not included. Some idiot editor deleted that scene.So, now, thanks to some idiot editor at Amazon, that thing of beauty is lost - forever!"
4,Schöner Beginn für einen österreichischen Weltstar,"Danke, daß es in USA diesen Film in Originalfassung gibt.Deutsche Untertitel sind ja auf US-Filmen kaum vorhanden undverringern den Kaufreiz erheblich !!"
3,Separate Lives: Pretty cool story,"This was a very interesting film. It combined a split-personality theme with a smooth detective thriller. It wasn't really hard to figure out the mystery surrounding the plot, but it was very entertaining to watch."
3,Mediocre film with a good Belushi performance,"SEPARATE LIVES is the story of an ex-cop turned psychology student (JAMES BELUSHI) and his professor (LINDA HAMILTON) who asks him to follow her for a few days because she's been blacking out and waking up in strange situations. He discovers that she's living a double life, and that she is involved in a recent murder case as well as a 20-year old murder case.Hamilton delivers a solid performance, easily slipping from one personality to another. Belushi, however, is the real impetus behind the film. This is the first film I've seen him carry, and he does it deftly.The story is mostly predictable with a few clunky twists and turns, but it ends satisfyingly. Having viewed a lot of ""thrillers"" in the past few years, I can say that this one is in the top half of those. Belushi's performance is what makes the film worth watching -- he gives a great performance in an otherwise mediocre film."
5,My Favorite so Far!,This is my favorite Abraham video. The atmosphere and the responses enhance the words presented thru Esther. Love it!
4,Abraham is good.,I never get tired of listening to the wisdom of Abraham. Ester does a great job and all is so uplifting. It works too.
5,"""The letter of Marque"" Patrick Obrian","Historically accurate as usual, characters come alive on the page- my knees are sore from holystoneing the deck!""The letter of Marque"
5,Superb Reading!,"There are no finer, accurate to a flaw, naval historical novels - all 21 of them - than O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series."
4,"A welcome series ""reset""","The last few books in this series had gotten very complicated and very dark. This book hits a much-needed ""reset"" button. Captain Jack Aubrey, who in the last book was stripped of his rank and convicted of a crime he did not commit, blazes his way to exciting, glorious redemption. Doctor Stephen Maturin, while still flirting with disaster with his laudanum addiction, reconciles some of his personal problems and resolves a confusing, multi-book story arc with a bang.The Letter of Marque is a fun and exciting read, though the story was not especially emotionally involving, so did not stick with me as much as thought it would. Great history and wit as we've come to expect from this author. On to the next book!Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel ""To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark"""
5,Best Read in a while,Continuity & action from page one & I would recomend this book to the movie fraturnity as it's better than Master & Commander in my view.
5,short recommendation,"There are numerous fine performances of Mahlers 3rd symphony, to name a few of my favourites:Kubelik (DG and Audite), Haitink (RCO studio and live), Boulez (DG).This performance by Bernstein ranks at the top in my opnion(Which I like best I don't know, probably Kubelik live or Haitink live)Never did I hear Bernstein give such a natural reading of a Mahler symphony, his spontaneity this time is more subtle, it doesn't interfere with the music or with the natural pulse of the music.I particuarly am very impressed with the performance of the second and 3rd movement. (my favourite movements of this symphony), the right balance between refinement, subtlety (beauty of tone) and sharper edges, brighter colors.(The perfect balance between Haitink and Kubelik if you like)The sound of this recording however isn't that good..."
4,A Mahler 3rd to treasure,"It is especially nice to have this 1961 recording back in the catalog. The playing is very representative of the NY Philharmonic during that portion of the Bernstein years. In particular, the playing of first trumpeter John Ware is atmospheric in the famed posthorn solo in movement 3. This has helped give a cult status to the recording and establish it as a benchmark, albeit an analog benchmark.The remastering is very good, making this a worthy addition for the collector."
1,1973 filming,"The plot of the story was, i admit, enticing and well thought out. However, the film quality is horrible. Mel Gibson himself stated that he wished the film never saw daylight. It's a cheap flick you can find in bargain bins for a buck fifty, i know, thats where i got mine. The only reason it's part of my collection is because im a die hard and dedicated mel fan...thats it. You can't get through the entire movie without turning it off...the sound is horrible, and the picture is very unclear. Very low grade flick."
5,"Taos, New Mexico","This book was my Christmas present to me. I loved all the pictures and the commentary. Ansel Adams was a genious, he saw the world with the eye of his camera and the vision of a real artist. I will display this book on the ottoman in my livingroom and know my family will enjoy it as much as I already have."
3,Uneven but excellent at times,Still for my money the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band is one of the great bands of the 60s. They are up there with Love bidding for the greatest overlooked band of the 60s. This CD is not their best due to its uneveness. It does however have some ***** songs. It is hard to find a some better 60s classic than the 'Smell of Incense'. 'In the Arena' and the classic 'What If They Had a War and Nobody Came' are well worth the money. The rest of the material is hit or miss.
3,Perspective is Everything,"If I hadn't already heard Love, Clear Light, the Byrds, Peanut Butter Conpsiracy and even Jefferson Airplane I would probably have a stronger review. Highly derivative of the era, the strong songs on this album would be average for the aforementioned groups. Everything you've heard about Bob Markely is true, but I doubt this group would have seen the light of day without his financing.My recommendation? Buy this, Vol 1 and ""the guide"" album and make one really good CD compilation of the good tracks, omit the narrative songs except Arena which eventually gets cool."
1,No Thanks,"I bought this out of a nostalgic yearning that came from good experiences with other dated but good stuff like Country Joe's 1st two albums etc. I had owned the 1st West Coast Pop album back in the day and although hokey, I liked it and I had never had this one, so I picked it up and man it was not real groovy for me. These guys weren't all that as they say today and it shows. In order for material to be ""timeless"" it's gotta be good and the people that made it have to have real talent and expertise. These guys were half-baked players at the time they cut this stuff and they are garbage band players even by today's standards which means they suck. They are so bad that I don't even think MTV would let them posture and jump up and down, even if they smoked cigs, had tatoos, and jammed all kinds of metal shards thru their lips."
1,DO NOT BUY,THe hard case broke with in 10 days with out any dammage. I would not buy even fro free. Waste of my time and money.
4,Great underrated band...,"The bluesy hard rock band Great White have been around for over 20 years. They got some attention in the late 80's with their cover of Ian Hunter's ""Twice Shy"" and (unfortunately) recently with the tragic fire at their show in RI. Of their many compilations, this is easily the best. I'd rather have studio versions of ""House Of Broken Love"" and ""Desert Moon"" and the blues mix of ""Face The Day"" is too long, but those are minor complaints. It's missing some good songs (""Lady Red Light"", ""Afterglow"", ""Can't Shake It"", ""Rollin' Stoned"") but what's here sounds great. The MTV Unplugged version of Led Zeppelin's ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"" is good to have (GW cover Zeppelin better than any other band I've heard), as is the B-side ""Wasted Rock Ranger"". A good overview of a great band."
4,Must have for hard rock fans,"Their greatest hit was One Bitten Twice Shy, but all of their songs showcase great guitar playing, strong songwriting skills, and passionate singing. The lyrics are all about sex drugs and rock and roll, nothing to write home about except that they are sung with a strong stance and are creative about saying the same thing in different ways. For Example, Rock Me keeps the sexual tension going strong throughout the quiet verses and then explodes into the choruses and guitar solo. There is a strong blues influence at the root of most of their songs and riffs and thing that makes for a timeless rock sound. Finally, not to be missed is their cover of Zeppelin's Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You which is impressive even when compared to the original. You can't pick a few songs, do yourself a favor and get the whole album, especially if there are some songs you're not familiar with. They're all good.- Gary Letona"
4,Great White,"I had never heard of 80's rockers Great White until they made the news a few years ago when a band member was killed in a concert fire, in a too crowded night club in the east. Numerous people died and they were part of an intense blame game investigation into violations of fire safety regulations. I was curious so I bought their first album. I liked them after the first play. Good hard rock/// But with some soft rock thrown in. Almost every song was great . House of Broken Love and Rock Me are stand outs that I play over and over//. Great guitar work by Ty Longley who died in the fire."
1,Jams alot,"Worked for a couple months, no problem. Then started stalling mid-shred. In order to get it going you have to reverse it out and push down on the paper to get it to start shredding again, and I'm talking about 1 or 2 sheets of regular paper. Another way is to shove more paper in, that seems to start it up. So, unless you like manhandling your shredder, get something else."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Priced for about $40, this shredder is quite expensive for what you get: A Piece of Junk! I bought this and it jammed the first second I used it! I put in three sheets of paper and it made a motor-grinding sound, generated a burnt plastic smell and then completely stalled. I had to constantly hit the reverse and forward buttons until the papers cleared. I decided to give it another chance and kept it for a month longer before I threw it out."
2,Aurora shredder,This works great if you have small amounts of stuff. BUT I was shredding old income tax forms and it is presently not working. Just found the info that came with it and it says 2 mins on and 4 mins off. It says not to oil--combustible--yet Fellowes says to oil especially cross cut. ???
4,The Wasp Eater,I thought it was an ephemeral novelette with several thoughtful descriptions of characters. Very good read.
5,A lovely small book ....,"A lovely book, written in a spare style, with a lot of underlying emotion that just barely ripples the surface ... Reminds me a bit of the delicate touch of Penelope Fitzgerald, nicely captures the feel of 1970s Connecticut, of a family falling apart, of a father who is kind of charming but more importantly a scoundrel, of a ten-year-old boy who doesn't know whether he wants his father back in his life (after the father cheats on the mother) or permanently out .... Definitely worth reading ...."
3,A Romance Junkie,"This was a really nice story but I almost felt like kicking my kindle across the room for the first five chapters. The constant mental dialogs of Jenine and Nikos was driving me nuts. I like when the story shows actions because it moves the story forward. The first five chapters drag and drag. I gave this story three stars because the ending was nice. I did read a story very much like this one but the hero was Italian coming to the rescue of his sisters marriage. Unlike this story, that book was wonderful from start to finish. In this story I really didn't care for Nikos untill the end, and I didn't like Jenine much either. I recommend this book if you have nothing else to read."
3,About the aspect ratio problem,"The aspect ratio issue addressed by other reviewers is genuine: stock NASA and USAF footage was massively used in this picture, but as this was shot in the standard aspect ratio of 1,37:1, it had to be stretched horizontally to match the 2,35:1 Panavision framing used for the rest of the movie. Hence the annoying distorsion that makes all aircraft look like some giant inadvertenly stamped his foot on them. Unfortunately, this is a flaw inherent to the movie itself, and the DVD is not to blame. The basic mistake was to shoot in widescreen a movie that relied so heavily on 'external' footage."
2,The lazy way to put out an old film,"""dhoggan"" is right on the money. This is the lazy way to release an old film. Nothing could have been easier than to have re-worked this film in a full-frame version with the NASA footage sections returned to their original dimensions, which are naturally full-frame. You'd think it would have been a breeze with the available technology and software. Instead of being able to advertise a newly restored version that's better than the original theatrical release ever was, they end up with a DVD that's getting pathetic reviews and which isn't likely to sell. Sales from the corrected version would surely have offset the cost of the easy re-working of the film. The problem here lies with whoever is responsible for marketing this stuff. Come on MGM - you're supposed to be better than this. How about actually THINKING first."
1,"Hideously distorted visuals, lousy plot and characters","As others have said, the archival NASA footage that makes up much of the film is s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d to fit the Panavision format, resulting in grotesquely distorted aircraft and people. And unfortunately, the film wasn't very good to begin with. My advice: stay away from this stinker. If you want a good (not great, but good) rocket test pilot movie with undistorted archival footage, try ""Toward the Unknown."""
4,none,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining. The actores were great. Having first hand knowlege of the X-15 project, Ihought it was fairly accuarte."
1,Slow suicide....,"What a piece of garbage...Amazon should immediately refund everyone's money and then bring legal action againest whomever is resposible for this abomination of a DVD. Did no one attempt to watch this prior to it's release? Probably did and were promptly bored to death....Lynn Stubblefield, Nashville, TN...btw, one star because there is no way to leave them all blank..."
5,"Buy this, now! You will not be disappointed!",I have and now I wonder what took me so long to 'get into' Dinah and Brook. You will enjoy the heck outta this...
5,Dinah & Brook: A 5 star pair,"It's too bad that Dinah and Brook only cut 4 numbers as a duet. Through the years, I've often wondered why they didn't. The write-up in the album tells why, and it's a sad story for aficionados of these two great voices.""Two of Us"" is a superb album and worth the price. I would consider it a must-have for any R&B; fan. Don't hesitate; go for it.RPB"
1,greekgodawful,"On a budget that makes Blair Witch seem like a Hollywood blockbuster, with production values that would be shamed by your child's high school play, with actors designed to make Arnie seem like Lawrence Olivier, with a director whose only experience was apparently shooting his kid's birthday parties, with a writer who doesn't know he writes comedy, here is a movie you can laugh at, not with. It fascinates like a train wreck and speaking of children, watching our governator get his start makes you feel proud. It also makes you feel that no matter what you have done, you can still be a success. I read that the guv donated a couple million of his 30 for T3 back to help finance the special effects. If he has any pride he will do the same to re-do this one. I think it was all done for about $29.95."
5,Excellent,This product was brand new as you always say and the picture and image quality is clear and easy to understand.Thank you for a job well done and I look forward to doing business with you now and in the future.Once againthank you for a job well done and keep up the good work.
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING!,THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW. THE ONLY LAUGHTER WAS AT MYSELF FOR ACTUALLY SITTING THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. ITS SAVING GRACE WAS DUE TO ARNOLD STANG. HE'S AN AWESOME ACTOR AND EVEN HIS PART WAS KORNY. HOW COULD THEY EVER HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE?Hercules in New YorkIF YOU ARE CRAZY ENOUGH TO BUY IT PLEASE PLAN TO GIVE IT AS A GAG GIFT. IT'S NOT FOR PRESERVING.
1,even schwarzenegger must hope this one goes away,with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!
1,"I don't care if it is Arnold's first film, it is so stupid!!","Arnold Schwarzenegger's worst film, obviously this one, is so lame- even for 1970! He voice is dubbed for Gosh sakes!!!!! I fell asleep in this film, as will everyone else who watches it! HERCULES IN NEW YORK (1970) Rated: G 1/2 star out of 5."
1,What the Hell!!,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this film. ... Not only did it look [inexpensive], but the acting, my God the acting! I am usually a fan of Arnie's films(other than Batman & Robin)but I couldn't stand hearing that voice of his, well actually it wasn't his voice. Just a campy dubbed version of what a muscular guy would sound like. I guess I could give Arnie a break, after all it was only his first film. If you haven't seen this film yet, I strongly recommend it just for a laugh."
5,One of the rarest movies is now brought back to movies!,I've been waiting 2 years for this movie to be on video. it's arnold schwartzenegger's debut movie. i haven't seen the movie yet but im sure it's going to be funny. hurry up and buy it. enjoy (Note. Arnold Scwatxenegger's voice is dubbed in the movie. that what makes it funny)
3,Super Schlock,What would you expect from a movie with a title such as this? Can't be taken seriously... Amusing.
3,AAHHnoldtt is kool,This was a very funny movie. It shows how green Aaahhhnolld was in his early acting career. I bought it to complete my Schwarzenegger collection of movies.
1,Dis-ass-trous!,"I love Arnie, but I just couldn't finish this movie. Thank God he's like fine wine and improved with age. I have all his movies, so I guess as far as collection value goes, I'll have to keep it, and maybe someday I'll even finish watching it!"
2,Get Real,"This is Arnolds fakiest film. I mean, a demigod? I can't believe this at all...fakiest film. Yes Arnold is in peak condition in this film, but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow...come on Arnold, no one talks back to Zeus!"
3,hercules,this movie is ok but not thebest ther are one thing I likeabout it.it has arnolds real voiceto select on the menu
2,Didn't Like It,"See Arnold Schwarzenegger as the mythological Hercules! Toga clad andripped to Mr. Universe proportions, Hercules is bored with life on Mount Olympus and declares his desire to live among earthly mortals angering Zeus, his Father."
1,Governor Arnold at His Worst,"I realize that there has been an increase of interest in Arnold movies ever since he became Governor of California, however if you want to see an Arnold movie go see ""Kindergarden Cop"" or ""Twins"" (which even both of those movies aren't that good). It's no wonder this movie never did well at the box office. The storyline and the acting was extremely bad and very cheezy. It should be considered a spoof, rather than an actual movie. I would not see this movie, but if you must see it, do yourself a favor and rent it first."
5,This is funny!,Any Arnold fan Needs to See this Movie. This is great you won't believe it. Arnold is dubbed and it's so cheesy.
2,so bad that it's...really awful,"The dual billing of Arnold Stang and Arnold ""Strong"" is the first hint to this film's cult legacy. Old-timey comedian Arnold Stang and the future gubernator team up in this hammy and cheesy fish-out-of-the-Mediterranean film from 1969. Most of the supporting cast is made of petrified wood, though veteran actor James Karen was somehow enticed into this Z-grade effort. Horrible production values approach the night-as-day scenes inImpulse, including car horns evident on Mount Olympus.It would be eight more years before Schwarzenegger made a proper introduction to audiences inPumping Iron, and I suppose there is a certain charm in seeing the big guy for the first time. But Hercules in New York would really only be worth watching with snarky commentary. The only reason I didn't rate it one-star is because of the laugh factor. But the laugh factor isn't high enough. The pity factor, on the other hand, is off the charts."
4,Bought this for my Dad,"For many years my dad has been wondering where to find this movie. Being that he's computer illiterate, I took it upon myself to purchase the VHS version here on Amazon. It was supposed to be a Gag Gift for Christmas, but I caved in and gave it to him on Thanksgiving. It's amazing how such an inexpensive gift can make someone's day ."
4,Dubbing Arnold's Voice= Genius,"The main reason to get this movie is to hear the dubbed voice it's so ridiculous I could'nt stop laughing the movie starts with Hercules going to N.y. where he meets an older gentleman named Pretzy who coincidentally sells pretzels late he meets a pretty women and try's to woo her more hilarity ensues, the begining of the movie is great where you hear the voice actor the most,Later Hercules goes into wrestling to pay his debts(it gets boring themovie slows down from here) later is chased by mafia men who he owes money(the chase scene is way too longthe editor needed to do a better job) another thing I love is Arnold mannerism's in the movie and pretzy's facial expressions I only saw the movie with the voice actor's voice It's painful and very hard to understand Arnold but it can be funny at times."
4,A good book of Memphis Jewish history.,"A well written and researched book of Memphis Jewish history especially if you live in or around Memphis and the Mid-South.The book sometimes gets out of chronological order as far history dates are concerned but it is still interesting and easy reading.There are a few typos but they don't interrupt the story line.All in all if you are from this area,as I am, you will find many names and places that have significant meaning."
5,Must have if your Jewish family helped to found Memphis,The author has dug up the names of all of the Jews they could find. It was very helpful to find neighbors and relatives and kind of a thrill to see my family members named.
3,It was just okay,"I have read many books by Ms. Alers and this was my least favorite. The story was so unrealistic. The fact that one statement by one person could keep these two lovers apart for 14 years is ridiculous. This story was missing the usual background and character development that her books usually have. At the end of this book, I found that I did not connect with any of the characters and barely liked the female character. I don't think I am going to read the other Blackstone books."
1,Disappointing,While the plot had all the makings of a good love story it failed miserably in bringing it together. The story was rushed and there were times when the author skipped months and years without as much a preamble and left you guessing. Not a fan and I'll try one more book in the hopes that the writing has gotten better. Wish me luck.
3,Compared to her best this doesn't measure up,"I wanted to like this story, but it felt rushed and disjointed. She builds up a romantic story line and then skips over into another story entirely. I must admit I like the stories about settlers better than the more modern settings and situations. I suppose the wars aren't that modern but they're a less innocent time. I felt like she had cheated her readers by rushing this to press before taking the time to edit it properly. She had proved herself in the past and I'll buy her books again but it was really disapointing. A writer who can write Roses For Mama can do a lot better."
3,When Tomorrow Comes,"Being a Janette Oke and looking forward to reading her books, I was disappointed that the book did not end in the way I had expected. I was pleased to see that I wasn't the only one who holds this opinion. I thought that it would have been a much better ending had it been Christine and Laray, especially with him going to the North as well rather than Eric. I hope Ms Oke writes another one in the series where Christine changes her mind for laray, i really liked him!"
5,A Good Read,I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. I couldn't put the book down until I finished. I would recommend these books to anyone who likes good Christian reading.
3,First four books better,Love the author. Love most of her books. But I am having a hard time working my way through this book. The first four in the series are great. These last two having something missing.
4,A must read,A very well written book to the Canadian West series. A seventh book is needed to make a final read in this adventure...
4,When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6),I have read all the Canadian West Book Series writen by Janette Oke. I find her stories wonderful and exciting. It gives me a bit a of insite to how hard things were in the early day.
5,Fantastic!,"I heard Eric Darius perform on Warren Hill's Smooth Jazz Cruise and immediately bought his CD ""Night on the Town."" This is one of those rare CD's where every tune is great. The single ""Night on the Town"" has hit written all over it. This is currently one of my favorite CD's and I listen to it constantly. Eric plays with subtleties, flavors, and expressions of feelings that will have sax lovers proclaiming that he is one awesome player!"
5,The best,I have this and i love it i have droped it so many times and it still takes grate photos i have droped it in coke and let it dry for a day and it still works i have had this for 3 or 4 years and i love it the video is so good to the best ever i am still useing the fist battery that it came with i can not say enough about this camera!
3,Beautiful Pictures Problems with Video,"I love the quality of this camera's photos but Ive had a problem with the video mode recording the moter sound inside of the camera. I sent it to sony repair but they sent it back without fixing the problem. I can hear fluttering sounds when playing back the video both on the camera and on the computer. They say nothing is wrong, but, this didnt happen when I first bought it. I have owned it 9 months now. Wish me luck."
3,Not good at night,This is great camera during daytime.At night the lcd picture is hardly visible specially when tele is used .Iwish there was a viewfinder .
3,Not for use in dim light,For the most part this is a wonderful camera. The touchscreen makes it incredibly easy to use. My only issue is that in dim light it is impossible to see your subject in the LCD screen. This issue becomes worse when you are zoomed in. The issue is significant enough for me that I am returning the camera. I have used other cameras where the LCD brightness was increased as you zoomed in. Cameras with a viewfinder of course do not have this issue to the same extent.
3,"Great Camera, except for when its in the mail.","I've had this camera for about 2 years. paid $450 for it new at best buy. Cool features, touch screen, ability to draw funny faces....It also takes great pics. I've had a few cameras and cant help but update every year or so. Normally i won't hesitate to give and old camera away but luckily i kept my last one. My DSCN1 has gone home to Sony twice. And is now broke for the third time. Not broke from misuse just broke, The first 2 times it was under warranty, but now they want $200 to fix it? I think I'll move on. The EN V line from samsung looks good."
3,LCD screen,"great touch screen features. makes life easyyyyy. problem: at night you can't see what you are aiming for and indoors at night, no clue what you are seeing or shooting. too much orange in the pictures indoors too and not good colors."
5,Love it...Love it....Love it,"I owned 2 Kodak digital cameras and they both broke after a year or two....Was looking into another camera and after much research decided on this camera.I love it!!!!-The pictures come out great-Love the touch screen, although sometimes get a little lost trying to get to where I want-everyone I show is really impressed with the slideshows.-I am able to keep the pictures I really want to show on the camera without taking up room on my card.-Haven't used the paint feature much, but can see several uses for it.Overall it is the best camera I have owned!"
1,Quality issues,I'm in the process of getting my second one of these gizmos repaired/replaced. The lense will not retract after being shut off. This should not be happening. It goes off to Sony next week for warranty repair. Not even 60 days old. Not good.
5,BEST CAMERA!!,"I had my share of digitial cameras and received this as a gift this year (2005). It's the best digitial camera I've owned. It's light weight works great in the dark and because it's not big, my daughter doesn't think I have a camera one me. That's the best! Sony did a great job with this camera."
5,Top marks Great camera,"so far this camera has beaten all my expections for staters3"" touch screen,8.1 Mega picels,video and stills then theres the quality of pictures that it produces i have only had it for a week but this camera has best seller writen all over it small and high quality top marks to sony !!!! 5*"
1,Touchscreen broke after one week!,"I don't know how many times I have to get burned by Sony's poor quality control before I give up on the brand. I really liked the design of the N1 and the first batch of pictures met my expectations, but the touchscreen died on me during the second day of our vacation! It turned into a bunch of colored bars like your TV does during emergencly broadcast tests. Given there is no optical viewfinder, this meant I was out of luck. Additionally, most controls are accessed via the touchscreen (many inelegantly) so when it goes, the camera goes."
4,Sony Cybershot,"I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use. And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen. The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible.ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it."
2,I hate this unit!,"I purchased two units--one for our home and one for our vacation home. Within a few days, the unit at home was no longer making good crema. The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then. The design of this unit is ""odd"". I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird. If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over. I also suspect that the thermostat is broken. It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.Overall, I hate this unit. I'm going back to shopping!"
1,"If it is George, it must be very bad","I have met and seen George in his true enviornment, if he must submit this ruse, I suppose his must live with it. ONE MUST REMEMBER TO FEEL HIS ROOTS, and remember to live them.We are not larger than life itself, K."
4,well done biography on 1st moonwalker!,"this profile gives the reader all the basics; covering neil a armstrong from childhood, through present; with basic facts about 1st human on moon. tells reader enough to help better understand him, and his life"
5,Work Great!,"Love these wipes. I use them on my eyeglasses and camera lens. No residue, no lingering odor to irritate your eyes."
1,Not what I received!,"I ordered the cloth version of Zeiss Lens cleaner but I received the ""standard"" version. I ordered a count of 200 and the items were ""dumped"" into an express mailer - perhaps I received 200 or just as likely I did not receive 200."
1,Zeiss Lens Cloths Suuuck,"I bought 2 triple boxes of these to replace the overpriced Sight Savers. I use these to clean my polycabonate eye glasses.I am not sure who came up with the solution for these , but they leave streaks and foggy areas- each and every time. I am shocked that a company like Zeiss would put their name on this product. I have tried these on binoculars and camera lenses- same result.Save yourself the grief and go get some lense cloths without the smudgy solution, and get a streak-free clean eyeglass or camera lense for pennies."

1,Poor Service,Items in the package was missing and when contacted for replacement... the seller was more distasteful.The resistance bands (the two that were there) were weak.
2,Supermodel workout?,"I graduated with a degree in exercise science....this is not a workout a model would ever do. The women accompanying the instructor are BEASTS of women. I have no desire to look like I can kick my husbands butt. I would describe this as P90X for women. He goes VERY fast and VERY hard. A muscle building series for sure. If you are wanting to look thin and fit, this isn't the workout for you. Want to look like you are on the edge of female body lifting?....this is just the dvd you need! I modify it by never going beyond level 1 and it seems that it is light enough to only build lean muscle. Not my favorite. Turbo jam is a much better workout for a woman."
1,No weights or bands,The package did not include the bands or the weights that are pictured. Only two dvds.
3,Not too happy,"I ordered this item after seeing the infomercial on TV.I was already pretty upset that Amazon doesn't list what is included in the package, all I had to go on was the picture provided. The package only comes with ankle weights, red and green exercise bands (not yellow), and the 2 discs seen pictured. There are no instructions or work out plans or anything. I thought there would be a calendar or something like the infomercial shows to tell you when to do each work out but there isn't. I guess you are just left to randomly do the workouts."
1,Little variety. Not pleased,Such little variety for 80 dollars. Very deceiving advertisement. Amazon should have stated more detail in the review or description box. Buyer beware. Two DVD s for 80 dollars what a rip off
4,Super Reader,"Not as good as the first, as a little slow in the middle, however, the start is interesting, sinister bad, guy, death trap, and the Shadow fights an ape-man at the end, on a ledge. An interesting SF note is that The Shadow uses television, in 1931, so watch some of his assistants, to improve on his 'portable wireless set'.We also get to see him in his Lamont Cranston identity and see that it is pretty definitely him."
4,Strange Mix of Guitar Pop and Zappa-Inspired Weirdness,"This band was made up of a bunch of kids, one of whom, Michael Lloyd went on to produce records for The Osmonds and Shaun Cassidy(and put together the Dirty Dancing soundtrack) and one Bob Markley, a tone-deaf millionare in his 30s who thought being in a rock band would help him get chicks. There are some instant classics on this album like ""Transparent Day"", ""I Won't Hurt You"" that make the album a must-buy for anyone interested in 60s music, as well as a cover of The Mother's ""Help I'm a Rock."""
3,Its all perspective,"If I hadn't already heard Love, Clear Light, the Byrds, The Circle (Transparent Day) and even Jefferson Airplane I would probably have a stronger review. Highly derivative of the era, the strong songs on this album would be average for the aforementioned groups. Everything you've heard about Bob Markely is true, but I doubt this group would have seen the light of day without his financing.My recommendation? Buy this, Vol 2 and ""the guide"" album and make one really good CD compilation of the good tracks, omit the narrative songs."
2,Everything sticks,"Simply put - I wish I'd ordered a non-stick version of this product. Even when you coat the basket with oil, fish ends up sticking to it and falling apart as you try to remove it. It may work fine for other items, but if you plan to use this item to grill fish, I'd get a non-stick one instead."
4,Seems nice,"I got this for my husband. He hasn't used it yet, but it seems like it's decent quality. The handle is VERY long, much longer than I expected. Looking back at the dimensions, it does say that it is 29"" long."
3,Catan Card Game (for Two Players),"My husband and I love to play Settlers of Cataan although it is meant to be played by three or more players. We were told this game, Catan Card Game, was the solution for playing Settlers with two people. After playing it several times, we find we still prefer Settlers of Cataan. We usually play to twelve points. Maybe this one will grow on us but for now it lacks in strategy."
5,Fun two player game,This card-based version of the Catan game is a lot of fun. Part of the fun is figuring out the best strategy to use and trying out different strategies. The game is very replayable and great if you want the Settlers of Catan experience with only two players. The materials are high quality and the instructions are easy to follow.
4,Great game for a lazy afternoon,"We're avid Settlers of Catan board game fans, but always need to find a third person outside of our family to play. Designed for two players, this card game solves the problem. Once you work your way through the not very clear rule book, it's lots of fun pitting your strategy and luck against your opponent's to try and expand your medieval principality to gain 12 victory points to win. The small square cards are designed in vivid color and detail that add sparkle and interest to the game. There are enough devious maneuvers to keep the most avid gamer happy as well as the casual once-in-a-while family player. This is not a quick game. The card game can take several hours to play because it is hard to acquire sufficient ""resources"", needed to put into play other cards that will get you to your end goal. In other words, a great game for a lazy afternoon."
3,Disappointment!,"I ordered this product for my husband and they sent me the wrong game! The game was supposed to be new, but what they sent me was already opened, there were scuff marks all over and even game pieces had been previously opened and cards were wrapped with rubber bands. When I contacted the company to let them know that they had sent me the wrong item, they were very polite, but did not even have the product that I had ordered. Very frustrating, especially since I paid for the shipping and it took longer for the item to arrive than it did for the free shipping items I had also ordered!"
4,Swiss Army By Swiss Army For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces Swiss Army By Swiss Army For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4,the product is of very good quality time I get to not present any kind of problem I'm very happy excellent condition recomeindo provider thanks
5,swiss army for men,"excellent; responsible, very good handling of the goods, Everything arrived in order, I received it in the stipulated time, thanks"
5,muy bueno,"para todo aquel que le gusten los perfumes esta es una opción excelente, llego sin problema y muy bien envuelto"
1,malo malo,amazon should not sell these restricted products to their customers and make them waste time and money seems a mockery and a delusion of amazon and more when they do not accept the return of these products really arrependido to buy and waste my money.
2,BAD CONDITION!!!!!,The product was in bad condition!!!It doesnt smell like a real Swiss Army.I have real doubts about this product!!I think I will never buy again this kind of products by this way!!!!Please send my a REAL Swiss Army or give me back my money
2,Picture provided by Seller is not exactly the same as product,"Product is exactly the same but seller provides one image, which does not represent what it delivers. This fancy cloth black bag does not come together with the perfume!I want my fancy cloth black bag!"
5,Swiss Army ROCKS !!!!,This is most definitely one of Swiss Army's greatest works in their line of male scents. Lasts all day and has the scent that brings you the compliments you look for in a great cologne with a good bargain price.Definitely would buy again.
4,I received it in good conditions,"Hello, I received this product in good conditions! It is certainly an original article and category. I highly recommend the essence and aroma of the perfume does not equal another."
4,Nice Eau de Toilette,"This perfume was a gift for my father, he says that it is a nice perfume, he loved it, he has been wearing it since 5 years ago, he likes this one and the ""altitude"", so it is good."
1,It is fake and does not last as the actual one,I regret buying it. It is the worst cologne I ever spend money on. It is totally fake and it is not the actual product of Swiss Army. Don't buy it.
5,Very Down to Earth and Practical,"You know, one thing I always feel is, of what use is religion, What ever the religion may be, if it doesn't better the quality of the life we live, doesnt pull us out of the difficulties and challenges we land ourselves in. . Usually the vedic interpretations are too metaphysical and tedious to understand and relate. Here is a surprisingly wonderful interpretations of the millennia old wisdom of the Vedas as applied to our day to day lives. It takes you step by step from the challenges of the modern world or the Technology Age to its woes, the reasons and how to overcome them in a more generic way. This could be life changing. Swami Adiswarananda has epitomized the spirit of his Guru.Enjoy!!"

FOLOWED BY PIKACHU PARTY .
5,A Tall Tale about self esteem and determination.,"""John Henry"" is one of Rabbit Ears finest classics since ""Pecos Bill"" as it details the adventures of America's greatest African American hero going up against the steam drill. Denzel Washington's narration is energetic and proud as he narrates John Henry's adventures as if he was really there ( which he points out somewhere in the beginning of the story). B.B. King's music is probably the best part since it is jazzy and soulful, which brings life to this story. Barry Jackson's illustrations are colorful and beautiful, especially of the image of John Henry wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans. This Rabbit Ears classic will certainly be a favorite for both children and adults. Also, I would strongly recommend you watch the other Rabbit Ears classics such as ""The Fool and the Flying Ship"" my personal favorite, ""Pecos Bill,"" ""Princess Scargo and the Birthday Pumpkin,"" and ""The Emperor and the Nightingale."""
1,Buy the hard copy,"I really wanted to love this kindle book. But i dont. The problem isnt the recipes, they are well authored, there is a lot of information about the ingredients, there are several variations of many recioes. The problem is the kindlization of the book. There are two indexes, Subjects and Recipes. Neither contains page numbers or location numbers or hot links. So they are just a list of things you could,at best, consider to be search terms. However, you cannot rely on their finding anything useful. Case in point: the subject index contains the phrase ""tips for starters"" as in sourdough starters. If you enter this term in your kindle search, you get one result: the listing in the Subject Index. Circular and useless. I own many Kindle cookbooks. This one is poorly crafted and frustrating to use. Stick to paper on this one."
3,Many recipes don't work,"I am an experienced bread machine baker (over 10 years). While many of the recipes in this book are excellent, beware of the ingredients ratios. In my machine I had to cut back a lot on tne yeast. I used both the recommended SAF and Fleishmans Bread machine yeast with similar over-risen results. My pages are filled with notes on ingredient and baking modificatiobns. You may have to adjust your proportions according to your machine or do the baking solely in the oven after an observed rise. I even had a case of oven baking where the loaf ""exploded"" out of the baking pan due to way too much yeast."
5,I have to buy this book.,I had this book from our local library. Started marking pages to copy but there were too many. Tried the sour cream bread; it's great. Kept the book overdue at 0.25per day! Best bread machine book I've seen. I have to have it on my shelf.
5,Excellent Book!,"This book has it all! We got it before our new breadmaker arrived. It not only has tons of great recipes, but troubleshooting solutions to common problems, general information about different flours, etc., a great learning tool for beginners."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This is an outstanding, comprehensive book, with just about everything you could possibly need to know in one volume. I don't understand the below review complaining about the order of ingredients; I've never found it really made any difference what order I put the ingredients in, but if you like to, say, put liquids in first, who's stopping you?If I could only have one bread machine cookbook, this would be it. Fortunately, I'm not limited so I have many, and this is still just about the best."
5,The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 30.,nice cookbook to help you with homemade bread baking.even tells how to make pasta dough in breadmachine even if you don't have a pasta setting on your machine. so much info in this book.
4,Really Good Cookbook,"I found the book fairly worthwhile! Some of the recipes were a little difficult for me to follow, but all in all my family enjoys it. The best tip I can give anyone who purchases this book, if you're not sure read it again!!"
1,Make note: MANY of these recipes don't work!,"I rarely write reviews but I was so disappointed by this book that I felt moved to share my dismay and even warn others not to buy it. I've made lots of good bread in my Zojirushi from borrowed recipes, but the first recipe I made out of this book just yielded a panful of baked crumbs! I couldn't even imagine what went wrong--I had followed the recipe to the letter, and it wasn't a case of bad yeast (although the author's discussion of yeast is confusing and makes one doubt the validity of every recipe in the book). I wasted 4 and a half cups of good whole wheat flour on this recipe, not to mention 3 and a half tablespoons of vital wheat gluten--now if that couldn't make the crumbs stick together, nothing could! I wish I had taken these one-star reviews more seriously before I bought this book. I'm wondering now how to return the first book I've ever returned to Amazon...."
2,Poor,Almost all of the recipes involve using gluten of which I have unfortunately not been unable to find in the stores.
2,"Too hard to read, too much like a text book","This book had many, many words and great descriptions, but it was a lot to read - probably great if you're a serious baker, but we're much more casual and would have preferred more pictures, fewer words, and something more simple to take you from the beginning."
5,The Only Bread Machine Book You will Need!,"Bought this book along with The Zo bread maker. It is an excellent reference on bread machine baking and the only one you'll need. It is very detailed and will give you all the information you need to make excellent breads no matter what machine you have. I don't use the manual that came with my machine except for looking at the order to add ingredients and how to use it. Otherwise, I make the recipes from the book. They have all come out well. The two I recommend most highly are the SOUR CREAM BREAD and the BRIOCHE. These breads are the best I've ever had and get devoured by my family within a day. Yes, if you follow Hensperger's recipe for the BRIOCHE bread exactly you will be amazed that such a bread would come from your machine. I've made Brioche by hand, and I can tell you the result from the machine using her recipe is awesome!It's french bakery quality. Buy this book; you won't be disappointed."
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I was thrilled when I received this book for a Christmas gift. I am an experienced baker and I would not recommend this book for a beginning baker or bread machine user. I have made a couple of recipes with great success. I have also had my share of failures. Like another reviewer of this book, I find that you have to watch closely and continue to add more flour than originally stated in the recipe. There are some recipes that will not turn out unless you use vital wheat gluten or SAF yeast. This book however does have numerous helpful hints and sidebars stories of interest. I agree with another reviewer who does not like the index. This book is not a total loss for me, but again I wouldn't purchase it unless I was an experienced bread machine baker."
5,This book makes you want to experiment every day!,I got this book for Christmas along with a Zojirushi bread machine. The two make a great combination! Anything I have tried from this book has turned out great. A favorite so far is the biga recipe--it's a kind of starter.
3,Did not like the basic recipes,As a beginner i felt that this book had many complex bread recipes but not enough high quality basic ones. I didn't like the basic white and light wheat recipes. The coconut white bread didn't work at all. Perhaps more advanced bread makers will find it useful.
4,Bread Machine Cook Book,"When I first received this cook book, I was going to return it as it is quite large. After reviewing several comments from the Author, Beth Hensperger, on how to make a really good loaf of bread, I decided to keep it.My original objection was the detail she goes into about what to expect from a Bread Machine as well as the types of grains and flours to use along with the results you may receive.These explanations make for a large cook book (a total of 643 pages).I have tried several recipes that were very good, even better than the ones that came with my Bread Machine.The price is resonable and if you are new or accustomed to a Bread Machine it is worth the price."
4,"From the simple to the complex, many recipes to choose from","I have made several recipes from this book and all have come out really well. The franskbrod bread came out just beautifully multiple times. There are recipes ranging from the simple to the complex so if you are in the mood for easy or challenging, this book has it covered. The measurements are very clear and easy to use with items you probably already own such as measuring cups and measuring spoons. As with any bread machine recipe, it is well advised to also own a water thermometer so the water temp is in the correct range unless you own a bread machine that takes the extra time to bring ingredients up to temp, which I do not. The only ingredient that you may have a hard time finding if you live in a small town is Vital Wheat gluten which is used in many recipes. If that is the case, the Betty Crocker Bread Machine cookbook doesn't use gluten in the ingredient listing so you might want to try that one instead."
5,Perfect bread every time,"I received a bread machine and this book for Christmas and they have been used at least once a week since then. I usually make 1 lb loaves by halving the 2 lb recipes and it has worked really well. The 1 lb size is ideal for two people and the shape of the loaf works for sandwiches. None of the loaves have been a disappointment so far. I had never used a bread machine before and found the introduction to bread machines and their ingredients very helpful. I compared it with the user manual for my Cuisinart machine and there were no contradictions. The book provides more information than the manual. I used to make yeast breads by hand, but I think those days are over for me!I love the Honey Wheat Bread and Vienna Bread recipes in the book. They're great, and the Vienna bread has a wonderful texture - I have a loaf on the final rise in my bread machine right now and can't wait to eat it!"
4,"Tremendous Effort, A Bit Overkill Though.","Wow! What a large bread-book! This is a must have if you are a serious bread machine person. It is loaded with lots of information regarding a wide spectrum of breadmaking. The recipes are abundant. This is the kind of recipe book that you read in bed at night and imagine cooking the next morning. But overall, the tremendous amount of info can be overwhelming at times.If you prefer simple little cookbooks that get to the point quickly and can be laid upon the counter while measuring, this may not be your best choice. The text and lay-out are often busy and sometimes difficult to focus on.I prefer simplicity, lucidity and spiral spines in my recipe books.This particular bread-book reminds me of that creepy white guy with glasses on the Food Network, you know the guy, the one who provides all the history and scientific reactions behind the food but in the end you don't really care.....you just want to see it and eat it."
2,Eh...,"This book was just okay. Some of the recipes are nice and then there was the disaster I tried to make! I should have known better too! I tried the sweet bread with the crushed sugar cubes mixed in (I forget the name of the recipe in the book). Adding sugar cubes (even crushed!) to a non-stick bread machine bread pan is NOT a good idea! It totally ruined my bread pan by severely scratching the non-stick coating. AND I got nice non-stick coating flakes in the dough. Did I do something wrong? I don't know, but it seems some of these recipes have not been thought out very well or not tested or something.It has a lot of recipes, but it's almost too many. If this is your cup of tea and you want some more exotic breads, this might be for you. Just DON'T use the sugar cube bread recipe or you'll be shopping for a new bread pan for your machine!! I never used this book after that incident. I have found other, much better and simpler bread machine books since then."
3,Good variety and very detailed...,"...but almost all the recipes in this book require gluten. There are books available that include recipes with bread flour, but no gluten. It seems that the gluten in bread flour is enough for those recipes. Why would I go to all that trouble to get gluten which is not a naturally found ingredient in ordinary kitchens. And by the way, not everybody who uses Amazon lives in US. Gluten is NOT a convenient ingredient and makes a simple white bread unnecessarily expensive and inconvenient to make. There are very good alternatives."
1,Celiacs beware!,"I was reading through this book and noted recipes for Gluten free bread. One of the recipes listed ""White Spelt Flour Bread"" This recipe also included oat bran. Further reading found that the author suggested Kamut as well.The simple truth is that both Spelt and Kamut are in fact wheats. It is a violation of FDA regulations to claim such products are wheat free. Recently, January 06, a popular bakery was raided for doing just that.This book simply perpetuates fallacy and risks the health of the reader."
2,"Good ideas, bad execution","I bought this book because it had the largest and most creative selection of recipes, but that's just not good enough.After two failures today I referred back to some ""old standards"" and discovered that the proportion of flour to liquid is different by almost 3 ounces in some cases. The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour. In one case, adding flour never did compensate for the combinations of other ingredients (chocolate and orange segments).When I read the book more closely, I discovered that the author recommends standing by during mixing to make this adjustment on all the recipes. So much for having fresh bread ready when you wake up in the morning.The author's credentials seem good, but she doesn't understand the breadmaker's approach.I suppose I'll use the ideas in this book and adjust the liquid as needed, but it certainly won't replace the recipes that I've used for the past ten years. Too bad."
5,AWESOME collection of recipes - a must have!,"This hefty volume of bread machine recipes offers a little something for everyone. And then, it offers it in a variety of ways. I have found 4 favorite wheat bread recipes alone. The dinner roll recipe is an absolute favorite!There *are* some difficult or time consuming recipes in this book. But, there are a number of 4 ingredient recipes as well. It has something for the novice as well as the expert wanting to try something new.One reviewer took exception with the ubiquitous use of vital wheat gluten. Yes, it is in many of the recipes. Until I got this book, I'd never used it and now I won't make bread without it. It makes an incredible difference in the texture and rise of each loaf. It is pretty inexpensive and definitely worth the effort."
4,Beware of the Dutch Sugar Loaf,"Wonderful book, lots of variety and kinds of breads. Also very informative and gives great explanation where the bread machine manual leaves off. But beware of the Dutch Sugar Loaf recipe. It calls for semi-crushed sugar cubes and the cube bits scratched my pan and paddles quite badly."
5,Very good Recipe's,"Every one I have tried came out very well. They are a bit more complex than the ones that come with the breadmaker, but are so much better that it is well worth it!"
3,Needs more instructions for more whole grain flours.,"This book has amazing breadth, many different ideas for different types of loaves. But I want to make bread with all (or nearly all) whole grain flours. I was amazed at how many recipes had a large percentage of regular while bread flour.Even the breads in the section for Whole Wheat, Whole-Grain, and Specialty Flour Breads the recipes had lots of white flour. For example the following all have over 50% of the flour as white flour: ""Nine Grain Honey Bread"", ""Barley Bread"", ""Whole-Greain Daily Bread"".I like the heavier dark breads, and admit that most people like lighter breads than I do. This book would have gotten more stars if she would only tell me how to adapt the recipes. The author does mention that in time beginners will figure out how to adapt recipes, but I would like some hints rather than going through the school of hard loaves."
5,Should be shipped with every bread machine,"I've made quite a bit of bread but never used a bread machine. When I ordered my first bread machine, I wisely ordered this book at the same time. That was a very good decision. The first loaf I made was using a recipe in the bread machine's manual - it turned out so-so. I immediately grabbed this book. The machine hadn't even cooled down before I was pouring in the ingredients for Honey White Bread. The result? Homemade bread with the flavor and texture I remember as a child. I've since made two other breads from this book and they were flawless as well.This is not just a bunch of recipes. The first chapter is 'Orientation', providing enough information to give you the confidence you need. Confused about 'active dry yeast' vs 'instant yeast'? Page 13 has the answers. etc."
5,The best bread machine book I've found,"I bought 3 books when I got my bread machine and I got 4-5 from the library. The rest are collecting dust and this book is in my kitchen at least once a week. No recipe has failed me yet and there are a variety of interesting different breads (many whole grain!). It also explains how to go about changing or creating your own recipe with the correct proportions of ingredients. Like so many other small kitchen applicances, my breadmaker might have been relegated to an impulse purchase if it weren't for this book. It's a must buy!"
5,Works like a charm!,If you stick to the recipe and watch what happens after the kneading cycle your breads will turn out perfect time after time! Make notes if you adjust or alter and you have an amazing source for bread making (machine or oven) recipes.
3,Too many hard to find ingredients,"This bread machine cookbook has a wide variety of recipes; however, there are too many hard to find ingredients. I have had to go to multiple stores looking for things like barley flour and fructose powder."
2,this close to throwing this book out the window,"PROS: Good recipes.CONS: 1. print that is IMPOSSIBLE TO READ it is so small and light green in color, because presumably elves are the major audience. Trying to read ingredient amounts even with a magnifying glass will make you crazy.2. a useless index. If you try to look up recipes you can make using the delay timer, forget it. You have to go page by page and read the whole recipe through because this useful information is close to HIDDEN.3. directions that you often will guess at. In one, for Tecate Wheat Bread, the author says check the dough after ten minutes. She means ten minutes after the first kneading. Many users will know this. But even those who do will have to waste time wondering if this is what she really means. In another recipe, she lists molasses as an ingredient. Dark molasses, light, blackstrap? You're on your own, reader.Who designed this book? Who edited it? Someone asleep at the bread machine. no doubt"
2,Disappointed,Disappointed in this book. Not enough recipes for plain bread. Gave the same information as the booklet that came with the bread machine.
1,Disappointed,This is not the bread book that I thought it was. You have to be experienced with your breadmaker to enjoy using this book....it isn't for newbies for sure...
2,Bread Machine Book,"True, it may have everything in the world about bread, butI found this book tedious and not at all what I was lookingfor. I wanted simple bread recipies and this ""ain't it""."
3,Good Book,I purchased this book at the same time I purchased my bread maker. It's good book. Very well written and easy to read. Some of the bread making ingredients are pretty hard to find in my area of the country but I've enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.
4,Great for those that want to experiment.,"I just bought myself a Zojirushi bread machine, so I bought this book to go with it based on the overwhelming positive reviews. The recipes in this book seem quite amazing and surprising at the same time. I never knew you could make bread with so many different kinds of ingredients. While I haven't tried very many recipes yet, I have booked marked all the ones I want to make in the near future. I only give it four stars instead of 5 stars because it takes a week to get the book ready to ship, so even with Prime, you are waiting a good week and a half to get your book."
2,Add 1 tablespoon gluten!,"Nice recipes but the reason I make my own bread is to have healthier bread then what I can buy. To me, that means more alternate grains, no preservatives and less gluten. Most, if not all of the recipes in this book call for added gluten, not just the gluten that is already present in the flour but an extra tablespoon of gluten. Not very useful for me."
2,confused,"This seams to be a well writen book. But, I can not figure out the plus listed refers to. It doesn't appear to be with the gluten. I am thinking it is additional water if you have a welbuilt machine."
2,Don't Be Fooled By the Title!,"This is a great bread book, but a stupid bread machine book as almost all the recipes you only use the maching for initial kneading of the dough; after that, you take the dough out and bake it in the regular over - totally defeating the purpose of having a bread machine!"
4,good basic book,"Great book, gives you great ideas and works well with our bread machine. The only thing I wish was more receipes that do not require adding gluten."
5,THE ONE TO HAVE,EXCELLENT BOOK. GREAT VARIETY OF RECIPES. ALSO INTERESTING SIDE-BAR ARTICLES ABOUT MANY ASPECTS OF BREAD MAKING. I USE WITH THE BREADMANULTIMATE WHICH IS THE BEST BREAD MACHINE (I'VE TRIED OTHERS THE B-MAN ULTIMATE IS THE ONE TO GET .
3,One major weakness!,The recipes and information about breads and flours are extensive. It's fun reading.Major weakness: The recipes are written in a small font on a medium green background. Even with my normal reading glasses I have to use a magnifying glass to distinguish numbers in the fractions of cups.This means that I will have to type the recipe and print it out in an easily readable font size. I will not be able to assemble the ingredients straight from the book.
2,Not For a small Bread Machine,"I bought this and did not realize that this book is NOT for a small loaf. I have a 1lb loaf machine .The recipes are all for a medium 1-1/2 or large 2lb loaf. NO SMALL RECIPESYou cannot just halve the ingredient amounts, unless it's truly a large, pretty full 2 pound loafThe larger recipes are too large for the small machine but too skimpy if you halve them.I don't want to practice getting the amount ratios.Also, Almost all the recipes call for Gluten."
5,Can't go wrong,"After trying many recipies from scratch that just tasted blah, this book gets a thumbs up! I thought I was doomed to use mixes as that was the only thing that came out tasting great. iI have even left an ingredient out on some of the recipies because I didn't have it or made a small substitute and it still came out great. I've made several of the breads, all wonderful."
5,Best Bread Machine Cookbook,"This cookbook has the widest selection of bread recipes for bread machine bakers that I have ever seen. I purchased this book because my parents used it frequently for ""Tacotti Ranch Bread"" - their go-to staple. I love this recipe, but have also discovered many other favorites.Not only are there multiple sections for the different kinds of breads (white, wheat, sweet, herb, etc.), the ""other"" section is outstanding. I can't tell you how many times we've made the calzones! This cookbook is my go-to. I rarely buy bread from the store because the results I get from the recipes in this book are outstanding."
5,This book is a MUST for BreadMachine Users!,"After buying my Bread Machine, I had little luck with making breads. This book - all 600+ pages is the best book purchase I've ever made. Aside from the hundreds of recipes, the history, pointers, etc. found in this book are invaluable. Buy it! You'll be a winner with baking breads via your bread machine."
5,GREAT BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK,This bread machine cookbook has many great recipes to choose from. I would recommend it to anyone that has a bread machine!!!
3,Lots of recipes but...,I have owned a bread machine for over 16 years averaging 2-3 loaves per week. I have never used gluten in my bread nor have I really used over 2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast for a 1 1/2 pound loaf of bread which is called for in a majority of the recipes in this book. I wish I had known before I bought the book that gluten was a required ingredient for these recipes. I was hoping to make lots of new bread with 300 recipes to choose from but could not.
3,Just not that easy to find recipes,"While it's nice to read an overview about bread making and bread machines, I wish the recipes were all together in a section rather than having 'intros' to the various types. It would make browsing the actual recipes much easier."
4,Would benefit with pictures.,"Love this bread recipe book. Not only does it have the recipes for sooooo many breads, it also has an extensive first chapter on grains and tricks or facts that are very useful."
4,Yum...,"Really like this book. It's fun to sit down and pick a new and exciting recipe to try for my husband,myself, friends and family. There are many different bread styles to choose from than can help inspire new meal options. My current favorite is C.R.O.W.W. bread which stands for cinnamon, raisin, oat, walnut, and whole wheat. Yummy bread that takes me back to the says with my grandma. Another nice thing is trying different flours and ingredients broadening my my horizons. The only criticism. I would have is mot having weights of the ingredients versus cup. Thank you Beth for a great resource."
5,Helpful and easy!,I like that there were a lot of different recipes with additional suggestions recipes for meals to accompany the tasty bread. Easy to use and follow.
3,volume problems,"I just bought the Prokeys 88sx from Amazon. I'm having a problem with volume, or lack of volume, coming out of the earphones. The volume slider control kicks in about half way up, and a maximum setting it's still very soft. The keyboard is good quality for the lower price for this keyboard, and the sounds are authentic enough for a digital instrument. I just bought a keyboard amp for it, so perhaps the headphone jack on the amplifier will be more effective. The touch of the keyboard is OK, but don't expect the feel of a real piano. Update: I'm returning the keyboard because it's defective. After a few days it started doing strange things like turning off and on in the middle of playing it, and it would come on with a loud cracking sound. I hope it's just the fact that I got a lemon, and the volume problem mentioned above is part of this defect and the new replacement keyboard the Amazon sends is OK."
5,specs are for prokeys 88,"The description are indeed for the Big brother version , the 88..the SX is indeed lighter, 17 lbs, has 7 instruments, and semi-weighted keys ... my only gripe is the tremelo rate is not adjustable.. the depth is controlled by the mod wheel, but some of the rates on the E.P.s don't seem to ""feel right"",, could use a faster rate the organ patch isn'y very convincing; to much percussion, although you can obtain a pseudo fast leslie by selecting the highest chorus setting and cranking the mod wheel all the way.Other voices pretty good, it might benefit to use some external EQ on the sounds .."
4,satisfied customer,"I'm not a professional pianist by any stretch of the imagination.But I bought this keyboard a month ago and so far, I'm satisfied with the features. I had to buy a speaker and an amplifier as I did not realise you need them for sound.I wish they had stated that in the desription for amateurs like myself."
3,Not Bad,This keyboard sounds pretty good -- it's a full keyboard and light. The action is little harder than I thought it would be compare to the other Yamaha keyboard.A very annoying thing about this keyboard is the blue LED lights (not pictured) are extremely bright and distracting.
3,Great but not for high speed playing.,"I play pieces such as chopin's fantasie impromtue and ballade op. 23. This piano simply wont fly for such high speed songs, so I returned it. I got to this piano because I was on a search for the most realistic and portable piano out there. By realistic I was focusing on the touch. Like steinway touch. Because when you practice professionally, the sound isn't as important compared to the touch of the keys. Any pro would agree with me on this (yes, sound is important but again, NOT as much as touch). Also by realistic I mean full sized. I can't play pro piano pieces without the whole 88 keys available..So I got to this one, and judging on the reviews I thought it was a safe bet. It isn't if you're looking to play fast on it. It isn't if you want the best key touch on it. My search continues from here. I hope someone comments on this again to tell me if they've found that perfect touch and portability keyboard out there.."
5,Be careful which model you are buying,"I purchased the 88SX model based on the description on the site. However, portions of the description are for M-Audio's model ProKeys 88, the more expensive model. The 88SX has 7 great voices, is lightweight, easy to use and well worth the price. However, it does not have keyboard splitting functionality, 14 voices, sound layering capabilities or some of the other features mentioned in the description on line. I suspect that someone combined the descriptions of the two differnet models. I phoned Amazon and asked that they make a correction.Bottom line - for a basic keyboard, the 88SX is wonderful. It fills my needs perfectly. I am a gigging musician who doesn't want to lug a weighted 88-key piano around. The 88SX has good voices, simple operation and is very easy to pack around."
4,Suprised!,"I bought this keyboard to take with me to college. I was looking for something that would be portable, but play like the real piano I had to leave at home. This keyboard is definatly everything I was looking for . . . BUT there was one minor glitch when I got it out of the box. THIS KEYBOARD DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKERS!!!!! You have to buy them seperatley!!! Any you have to get special headphones. This keyboard really is made for people who are in bands and the like. It is still an amazing piano!!!! I love playing it! But it doesn't say anywhere on the product info that you need headphones or speakers to attach. Still love this keyboard though. It has a great feel. Even beethoven himself couldn't imagine how great the moonlight sonata could sound on this keyboard!!!!!!! I shopped around forever for a great keyboard. You would have to pay over 1500 for a keyboard this good anywhere else."
1,Never buy this item from 3rd party,After two months all LEDs were blinking. Thirdparty refused ti take it back. Amazon also refused after there phony A-Z service. Once the things are bad you are in for a big trouble. I bougtt quite stuff from Amazon but I am done for now. Will buy from costco which stands behind there products.
4,nice keyboard!,"playing this is close to real piano, and price is very reasonable. Sounds it has isn't that great but I should say it's fine unless you get some from other instrument."
1,Causes cancer and birth defects?!?!?,"Purchased this keyboard wanting to learn how to play the piano. However, on the inside cover of the instruction manual there is a big sticker saying there are chemicals used to make this keyboard which cause cancer and birth defects ""so please wash hands after using"". Is this for real?!?!? I cannot believe Amazon would sell such a product."
1,bored to death,"at school last week we watched this movie, history class. It was exteamly borning. I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST, PO"
2,BLU-RAY DISC. RED RAY CONTENT.,Please. If you love this movie wait for an official U.S. release. What should be BREATH TAKING visuals are rendered merely impressive by a low quality transfer. 2.0 audio track is uninspiring. no chapter or scene selections. At least they didn't cut the film length...
2,Excellent filmmaking;distorted facts;BLACK ROBE is a dull film,"Having watched this film several times over the years, I am still forced to come to the conclusion that as beautifully filmed and musically scored BLACK ROBE is,it still is not the absorbing film that perhaps it could have been. Long treks up and down rivers and over mountainous terrain and dense forest with little dialogue is not compelling enough for me to rate this film higher than 2 stars. Historically, it is not accurate in regards to the tribal customs of the Iroquois people.Lothaire Bluteau as ""Black Robe"" is a far more effective actor when left to speak French in his other film credits. He seems unsettled and unemotional in his English speaking roles.Bluteau is far more effective in JESUS de MONTREAL.I enjoy historical drama and actually prefer a well developed story that might move slowly; but BLACK ROBE still fails to inspire me in any way, other than looking at the mountains of Canada to Georges Delerue's music!"
3,A confused Priest in a Black Robe,"After reading the reviews about this movie, I had great expectations from it. The story is quite good, about a missionary Jesuit putting his life on the line for his convictions. Unfortunately, the priest is confused about his beliefs, and even shaken. At first he is determined to prove himself right, but later is confused. Secondly, this movie has a few explicitly sexual scenes, and frontal nudity. Not the kind of scenes you would expect in a movie about a priest. Compare this to the movie The Mission, about Jesuit missionaries in south america."
2,"Okay, not a barn burner though","Interesting movie, little short on the story line, some of the actors were not as believable as they could have been (the native americans), the romantic scenes were over emphasized, ...I love the period in history, is the only reason I remotely like the movie."
5,"A demanding story of courage, dedication, and faith.","A young French priest (Lothaire Bluteau) travels into the frozen Northwest wilderness of New France (169?) to serve as missionary to the Hurons. He sees the brutal life lived by natives--war, hunger, sickness--against the massive backdrop of a beautiful but indifferent, dangerous natural world. As he grows to respect his Indian guide, Chomina (August Schellenburg), he tests the limits of his own faith and discovers his love for the people to whom his mission may in the end be irrelevant. A stark and occasionally violent film that rewards re-viewing."
4,"Powerful, scenic, violent, with tremendous sound.","Similar to recent ""Last of the Mohicans"", but more factual, showing the difference between the French and English methods of dealing with the Indians. The priest, (Father La Forgue) and the Indian guide, Chomina, gave notable performances. The enmity between the Iroquois and Huron, apparently dating from before the white man's appearance, was highlighted."
1,Terrible. Hateful and cruel.,"This movie has a scene of a young girl being blackmailed and raped. It's disgraceful and hateful. Totally unchivalrous. Disgusting. Don't watch this movie if you want to sleep well at night, or if you have a conscience."
3,Mysterious film does not use all its resources,"This movie was actually a little too powerful for my taste...the characters seemed flat and forced me to look directly at the events, which are a bit intense. The actors, despite their excellent work, weren't given much to do. Father Laforgue only looked helpless and lost throughout the film. Also, Aden Young in the role of Daniel, Laforgue's young companion who falls in love with a Native woman, is an absolutely breathtaking male, completely beautiful. His performance is very quiet and honest, and the character was interesting, but the story was allowed to mask the people. But that story is excellent."
3,!,"Well, Black Robe is a very interesting and powerful film, and is a lot more realistic than Dances with Wolves. For people interested in history it is worthwile to see."
5,Black Robe,"Wow,is all I can say after watching this movie.I was really surprised that I liked it so much since I'm one of those people who rarely likes anything especially the movies in this day and age.There's forbideen romance,adventure,beautiful scenery,a good soundtrack and more.All the actors in this movie did a great job.This movie had me glued from start to finish.If you like Native American movies(like I do),then this is a must see!I love Dances With Wolves as well but this movie is more realistic as Dances With Wolves is more Hollywood.Just goes to show that you don't need big special CGI effects for a great movie."
4,"A Very Good, Haunting Film","""Black Robe"" is a movie that you think about the day after. It is gorgeous and gritty with its portrayal of early Canada.The story is not partisan or ""preachy"", yet it shatters the modern romantic and PC depictions of the idyllic life of the native tribes before the evil white man appeared.The scenery is stunning. The acting is superb. Dialogue? I don't remember any - the communication between characters is 90% accomplished by silent looks due to a rudimentary understanding of each other's native language. This too adds to the honest feel of the film."
4,The storyline is quite nice,"This book begins with a mystery for the birds of prey to solve. The plot is well written and the art is not bad. Though the superheroes are not dressed that appropiate for teenagers (i thnk), but it's a good read if you're interested in girl power and things like that.Overall, this book is quite interesting and suspense was accumlated throughout the book. In my opinion, I really did enjoy this read and I hope whoever that is going to read this will enjoy this book"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Gail Simone's work with Birds of Prey is of an high order. This trade is a compilation of four issues dealing with the kidnapping of the Black Canary by the cult leader known as Savant, after a mission gone wrong.The other Birds, with a bit of help, must work out how to get to her, and get her out."
2,Average,"The quality of paper is very bad, artwork of ed benes is very ordinary and nothing special. You can easily skip this ""first"" volume and go to Sensei and student (quality of paper is also very bad, but artwork is better and story is far more interesting). This comicbook is 7 years old so maybe I shouldn't have expected much..."
5,Fun!,"Never read a BoP before but I'm hooked now! The story was engaging and fast paced (it does taper off a little towards the end). The art was good - Huntress was especially well drawn, though unfortunately, the book really isn't about her.The concept for the villian was cool. I instantly liked and despised him and that, really, is the most important part of any good superhero story....The story also raises moral/ethical issues that are relevent to our time. It doesn't beat you over the head with them and it doesn't preach - nice balance there.All in all, a good, fun read. I just ordered the next BoP tpb..."
4,Good Stuff,"The star of the show is certainly Gail Simones writing, there is nobody working in US comics today who writes better female characters and more enjoyable dialog in general. The artwork is very capable and slick, though tending towards the cheesecake poses rather too often.If you like well made US superhero comics then you will like this."
4,Lots of Fun,"People were not kidding when they told me how great Gail Simone's writing is. I loved the story to bits. The artwork made me a bit embaressed though. It is very high quality, but the ever-visable nipples feel really... high school, you know?"
1,"""The Genealogy of the Sarchet family"" was a disappointment.","""The Genealogy of the Sarchet family"" was of lesser quality than expected. I have purchased other historic reprints from Amazon and have been well pleased. The quality of this particular reprint was a disappointment!"
4,works okay,"i bought this to prevent my computer chair from sliding away to easily, this solved the problem although it can come off from rime to time"
5,Pre-Bird Visiting Mingus,"Charles Mingus / Mingus Revisited: This Great album was originally titled ""Pre-Bird"" and then changed to ""Mingus Revisited"". By whatever name this album comes by, it is an excellent collection of songs. This one has Mingus' compositions plus two well known Duke Ellington numbers that are wonderfully interpreted by Mingus. This is a very entertaining CD. Five Stars"
3,Could have been better,"I was rather dissapointed in this Dummies book. There are tons of editing mistakes. In one chapter about the Vala, the author refers to a section about Melkor repeatedly. When one seeks out this section it is nowhere to be found. He completely forgot it!What I feel is the biggest problem with this book is the authors choice to analyze the text of the The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings apart from what Tolkien wrote about the books in other texts and letters. How can we write an accurate book about the origins of Middle-Earth and completely ignore Tolkien's opinions and thoughts? Especially considering that Tolkien put so much of himself and his Catholic faith into the books. Is Tolkien himself not the ULTIMATE origin of Middle-Earth?"
1,bleh x 5!,"If someone wanted to write a book about Tolkien & Middle Earth, they should have researched a little better. Not *this* garbage! Tolkien was a CATHOLIC -- & a hard-liner at that. Catholic. Not Buddhist, not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic (sheesh! Some of this stuff in this book was hard to read because it was so WRONG)! Yes, he got some of his ideas from mythology (the myth part of the book is ok, I guess. But, there are so many *other* *better* books about myth out there than *this*... I know I've read better). But, the books are basically Catholic. Just read the Sil & you'll see what I mean! There's hardly *anything* in here about Tolkien's Catholic upbringing as it pertains to the books. If I want the *real* story on Tolkien & what he believed & wrote, I'll stick w/Tolkien's Letters & Joseph Pearce.I shouldn't have bought this book, but... well, I'm a sucker for anything Tolkien....."
1,"Terrible, Full of Errors","I sat down in Borders and read this in half an hour. I am a huge Tolkien fan, and know all his works backward and forward, and this was such a terrible thing to see shelved in the bookstore. It mistranslates names, gets dates and events screwed up, and is simply a terrible reference material. If you want to know about Tolkien's Middle-earth, pick up Tolkien's books and *read* the things.Don't take this crappy short-cut."
3,"Good Information, but too much babbling","The first two-thirds of this book is an excellent reference on the people, places, history, and languages of Middle-Earth. It reminded me of things I have forgotten, such as Elrond's brother being the first king of Numenor, and Galadriel being Elrond's mother-in-law. It made clear some things I was fuzzy about, such as why the three Elven rings are not evil. It is flawed only by the author's pathetic political correctness. The last third contains the author's worthless babbling about his interpretation of a book that needs no interpretation. He should have stuck to a more factual account of Tolkien's influences. Without the last third, I would have rated the book four stars. Without the political correctness, five."
4,Not Bad!,This book is a great resource to read with the The hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. An excellent guide.
4,Review of The Origin of Tolkien's Middle-Earth for Dummies,"What I really like about this book is that it provides information on howTolkien developed his Middle Earth countries. (I haven't finished the book yet.)As all the books in the ""for Dummies"" series, the text is well organized with titles and subtitles.The map of Middle Earth does not give enough detail of Middle Earth.Additionally, a character analysis would be desirable."
4,An overlooked gem,"This is one of the most obscure movies ever made by Peter O'Toole, undeservedly so. It's by turns whimsical, dramatic, romantic, and heartrending, with a cast that makes the most of a rather peculiar story. Nobody does the absent-minded professor bit better than O'Toole, David Odgen Steirs is sanctimonious and self-centered as usual, and Hemingway was an outstanding choice for the flaky Mellie. Even the theme (String Trio Rock, which has, sadly, never been released) will reverberate in your head for days afterward.The biggest disappointments about this disc are the pan-and-scan presentation, which was poorly executed, and the lack of extras on the disc; no background, commentary, soundtrack information, discographies, or featurettes were included."
5,Creator,This was my favorite movie till I saw Random Harvest. This may be silly and sappy but I just love it.
4,Best Copy,"Best copy of this I've seen. Only a little was trimmed of of the opening, and that is a credit, so it doesn't really count."
3,original story ahead of its time,Peter O Toole makes the dialogue work but Mariel Hemingway's weird character didn't work for me. Weird oversharing isn't necessarily refreshing and intriguing. And I think trying to plug up a loss with a substitute is desperate and doomed to failure.
5,Wonderfully Thought-provoking,"Creator is a delightful movie combining comedy and drama and raises questions about life and ultimate issues. I loved the continuing reference to ""the big picture"" which is something we keep losing sight of because of day to day concerns. Don't miss this film."
2,Just barely so-so,I must have watched a different movie from the others here because I thought this one was pretty bad! Slow moving and not worth my time to see. This rates 3 big yawns.
3,Perverted sex and graphic violence for the history buff,The third book in a series that puts the myth of Camelot in a real historical context. Plenty of action and a very clever interweaving of myth and reality. The violence of the times is graphically described with lots of blood and guts being spilled. This volume includes descriptions of violent sexual perversions that you may consider unsuitable for younger readers - a thought to keep in mind if you are thinking of buying this as a gift. For adults that want an all action historical novel this will probably not disappoint. Very similar to the Bernard Cornwell series of King Alfred novels but with rather more explicit sex.
3,"Tower to Whyte! Pull up, Jack! Pull up!","Jack Whyte achieves a mildly unsatisfying semi-closure in The Eagle's Brood. In an apparent attempt to tidy up the landscape before Arthur's arrival, he manages to kill off most of the characters from the first three books, including a sexually perverted Uther. At least, I hope Uther is dead. On the positive side, The Eagle's Brood is fast-paced and entertaining, and it promises more of the same in subsequent books. However, Whyte is beginning to demonstrate that he is assuredly not Mary Stewart, Parke Godwin, Stephen Lawhead, or Bernard Cornwell. If he wishes to join such august company, he needs to do a better job with continuity and cut down on the sordid sex and violence. The Arthurian legend is a more than adequate vehicle to propel a good writer like Whyte in to a truly exceptional author. So, Jack, get with it! Let's see a compelling and exciting transition to the life of Arthur. And please, no psychological baggage!"
5,My Brother Loved It,This is one of my brother's favorite authors. He was thrilled that we got this for him. He gave the book a ten.
4,One step closer to Arthur!!,"I enjoyed the third book in the Camulod series slightly less than the previous two.I felt that the author got bogged down with detail in both the battle scenes and the theological discussions.Merlyn comes through as very human rather than the complete mystic that he's been portrayed in other stories,being brought out of his rather pompous attitude towards right and wrong by his cousin,Uther. If you are planning to read the entire series,this is an important bridge between the earlier times of the Roman occupation and the first emergence of Arthur,as a baby.Now for number four-The Saxon Shore."
1,A good series gone bad,"A wonderful series with outstanding military and historical foundation and detail, gone bad. The writer doesn't even seem to know his own characters anymore. The sex scenes seem like they were written by a 14 year old kid. When I began to get the distinct impression that the author had lost his way, I put the book down. As a historian, I'm disappointed that Whyte has chosen to sell out with this drivel."
2,"Good ideas, tiresome writing","I like what this guy is trying to do: like Tolkien, he is trying to revive a world of epic meaning. Unlike Tolkien, he writes with constant dramatics, thinly disguised allegories as characters, and frequently rambles on for dozens of pages on completely irrelevant points. The author's asides contain plenty of great information, as does the character of Merlyn, but this is often painful to read from the sheer repetition of technique and emotion..."
2,American TV in 1944? Heh-heh-heh!,"This WIN PRODUCTIONS DVD is curious and highly suspect.There was no AMOS 'N' ANDY TV show in 1944, nor did Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (pictured here all corked up) appear in the early 50s television sitcom. (Amos Jones was played by Alvin Childress and Andy 'Hogg' Brown was Spencer Williams.)The three episodes divided into parts on this item's Editorial Review (""Invisible Glass,"" ""The Gun"" and ""Kingfish Gets Drafted"") are single-episode programs that run 25 minutes each. As for ""the best episodes of Amos & Andy,"" that's a matter of opinion. They're typical A&A; shows, to be sure.I doesn't know 'bout dis one, Andy!"
2,"I am missing something, right?","So this is a ""London Times Funny Music Cartoons"" mousepad that features Barry Gibb of laying on a psychiatrist's sofa quoting the beginning lyrics to....""I Started A Joke""???. But Barry doesn't sing a single note on the song which everyone knows is pretty much a Robin Gibb solo, so the selection of this lyric for this cartoon makes no sense. Clearly the artist was not very knowledgeable about the subject they were rendering a cartoon about. And oh yeah- how is this cartoon funny? I know the lyrics make no sense (many early Bee Gees lyrics don't), but how is this cartoon funny? The London Times actually published this at one time (I guess it was a slow news day. And now some 20 years later, I would want this cartoon as a mousepad because why?? Oh- and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too."
2,Heavily Censored 'R' Version,"Sadly this DVD being offered is the Good , but heavily censored version of 'Anthropophagous The Beast'. While this version is good and has it's moments , it is sadly missing many minutes of footage due to the United Kingdom and the United States moral censors with too much time on their hands!..."
1,Dvd release that you can rent at a video store?,"Okay, this butchered version of ANTHRPOPHAGUS:THE BEAST just goes to show how in a hurry DVD companies are willing to put out a film. People not familiar with Joe D'Amato's work shouldn't buy this film. People who already own a copy may want this version for comparision purposes. My advice for people is to either look for an uncut dub copy or try to seek out the Astro DVD version which was released in Germany but sadly is in German with no subtitles."
3,Movie better than DVD,"Anthropophagus is a fairly fun, cheesy Italian exploitation film. It's not really that gory. Yes, at one point the dude rips a lady's fetus out and eats it, but the gore effects are really too cheap and amateurish to be all that intense. I still recommend watching it if you're into this type of movie, but you might have some trouble with the DVD. Half the time when I put it into my player, I get the message ""bad disk"" even though the disc is clean and unscratched. But the other half of the time it plays fine, so it's really just a minor annoyance."
2,"BEWARE OF THE DVD LTD ""GRIM REAPER"" EDITION","And I mean really beware. It's not about the movie itself which is quite good and considered by many as a classic horror - it's about the edition. First it doesn't even have a menu. But that's a minor misdoing. What's more important - this is a TOTALLY cut version. All the scenes that are loved by viewers and because of which the movie became famous are not here. And I mean ALL.Wait just a little for a new 2-disc Media Blasters' ""Anthropophagous"" edition which has to be a full-verison. And this one... Maybe in 10 years it will become a rarity and you'll be able to sell it profitably :) Who knows?"
1,CAN'T FIND A GOOD SLEEPING PILL? THAN BUY THIS MOVIE!,"Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the ""One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era."" line on this back of this movie case. I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99. It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is. I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times. If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento. Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible. Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles. The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language!"
1,Stay Away!,"What a pile of poop, this is a very , very boring film, and stripped of the gore scenes, you better save your money for something better, banned in the UK, if you saw this version you would think we were all mad in the UK, uncut version - The Anthropogous Beast - hmmm - quick somebody get the uncut version - Anchor Bay?"
2,Rather poor quality,"I am not sure, but I think that this movie is still banned here in Germany. The more I was looking forward to see it in its original, that is uncut, form.However, the quality of this edition is rather poor. While it seems to be uncut, the sound and picture quality (even considering the fact that this whole thing was shot on 16mm) is a major nuisance.The opening sequence (with a young girl being killed in the water by the cannibalistic George Eastman) was shot in German language, but it took me (as a native speaker) a while to realize that this was neither Italian nor English! That's how bad the sound quality is.The movie as such besides its technical flaws, is...also a disappointment, at least in my book. Bad acting, bad directing, a minimum plot, quite passable special effects...this is not enough to satisfy me. (I have to admit though that I am not too much into late 70s/early 80s Italian horror flicks, so my opinion may not be of too much relevance here.)"
3,I don't think so...,"...ok, this was a huge disappointment. The movie started kinda slow, now that should not matter, if it had picked up aand made up for it in the end, but it didn't. The first time I started watching it put me to sleep, for over an hour nothing really interesting caught my attention. So I decided to finish watching it two days later and still was unimpressed. I gave it three stars thogh because the DVD presentation alone deserves some credit. The cover looks cool, and it comes with an extra DVD of special features. The Joe D'Amato documentary is interesting enough to make up for where the film lacked. Overall I was not impressed with this film, there were two memorable scenes, but that is it. I'd recommend this as a rental, if you can rent it anywhere. I would only recommend buying it if you are into these types of movies and you absolutely have to have it in your collection, which was my case."
3,Don't buy this version,"Saludos Terricolas, Go to the point, in this version never see the ""awesome"" fetus-eating scene, and the self-eating final scene. This movie is verry good but is X-treme if they put this two scene. This two is the verry power of the movie thath why the people of the 80' (including me of course) see this movie some many times in vhs, oh and if you want to know the languege of this version is english, but how cares that !!!"
2,So this is Anthropophagus?,"Of all the gore-miester, gun-for-hire directors Italy produced in the early 80's, who enjoy a cult following, Joe D'Amato has to be the worst and most undeserving. Anthropophagus is supposed to be one his best, along with equally so-so Beyond The Darkness. Void of style or suspense, all Anthropophagus consists of is a handful of shock kills, and a tedious, nearly incoherent framework to fill out the run time. The ghoul-man is creepy to behold, but few who sit through the whole film are going to walk away feeling fed.D'Amato's films often feature hard-core sex, and he would later focus exclusively on porn, which makes sense when you consider his ""money-shot"" and filler style of filmaking. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are porn films, but my standards for horror are a little higher, and I choose my hacks with greater care."
1,This Was BAD; Very Bad! Bored to the Bone!,"Many individuals have certainly heard of this cult classic. After a painful viewing, it was discovered to be slow and very boring. There is nothing that could save this film. Missing this film is an asset, but do not take my word for it. Go ahead and waste the money to see it for yourself. Then you could write a bad review. I did read some of the good reviews, but I just do not get how anyone could find this movie better than one star. No stars would be a better score for this snail."
1,Why Buy?,"Why would anyone even buy this knowing it's the [terrible], heavily-edited version? This makes me sick. All this talk about ""freedom"" and a silly 80's horror movie cannot even be viewed by adults. When the un-cut version becomes available, then I'll give 5 stars and purchase."
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD","Although this is one of the ""all-time"" video nasties, the version put on this DVD hardly can be watched for every drop of blood has been cut from this version. Anchor Bay, if you read this, please release this movie as it should be!"
3,Cut yet effective Italian horror fest,"A group of young men and women sail the Adriatic only to come to an island strangely abandonned. What they don't know is that a monsterous cannibal , an Anthropophagus (original title) is stalking them and eating them one by one. Although the US cut doesn't include the vicious fetus eating scene or the gut munching finale, this film is still an effective thriller, and a bit more cerebral than the traditional Friday the 13th genre slasher which is a surprise considering that it was filmed by Joe D'Amato, the king of the Italian C-movie."
3,George Eastman 's presence as the monster shoulder's this cheesey but atmospheric gem !,"If your a fan of Italian horror then you will surely find a place in your disturbed heart for euro slease legend Joe D'Amato's cheesey cheap but very atmospheric cult classic ""Anthropophagus(aka:the grim reaper)"" with it's very few & far inbetween legendary disturbing gore scenes intact & a great picture quality compared to any previous version that i have ever seen & a creepy interactive menu screen along with a couple of treats makes this ShriekShow version the one to own. I do have a larg grudge though about one of the speacial features(the most important feature) the documentry on D'Amato has no subtitles and is completely in Italian language?! What was ShriekShow thinking by not adding subtitles??? What a waist! Anyway this is still the version to have so go get it!"
