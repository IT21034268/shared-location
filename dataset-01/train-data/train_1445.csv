4,Great CD!,"I bought this ..., bacause they covered the song ""YouLied"" on there. I was very suprised at how much I liked thetrack. I went out and bought the CD, and absolutely love it. It's ashame that this band didn't make more records! The vocalist soundslike the classic 60s/70s stoner hippie British guy, and his voiceblends beautifully with the music. Comparing this CD to ..., I wouldsay that this is certainly more classic rock then ..., but it isstill great. This album is underrated, and more ... people need tobuy it! Why do you think that it was reissued or that ... playsthieir songs ""Spasm"" and ""You Lied"" live all thetime if it wasn't good?"
2,Musically Thin.,"Wow. I see this album got 3 1/2 and 4 stars from a couple reviewers. Let's get real. A four star album is a near classic. Something like OK Computer, In Utero, or Aenima earns four stars. Anyone wanting this album thinking your are going to get something reminiscent of Tool should save his or her money. The songs are banal and thin, and the vocalist sounds like he is singing underwater. Sure it's got Justin, and Adam helped out with the artwork, but their collective talents can't save this one. The songs are just re-mixes of the first Peach album. Nothing has changed. If you want an album that reminds you of an early-years Alice in Chains bootleg then buy it, but try to get it used. But if you are searching for something of quality with musical depth and intrinsic lyrics, you'd better keep looking."
4,Pretty good...,"First off, there are actually twelve songs on this album, not two, as Amazon currently has listed. That said, I mainly bought this album because I'm a huge fan of Tool, and I wanted to hear what Justin Chancellor's old band from the UK sounded like. I definitely like them. More straight-ahead than Tool, with hard, driving riffs interspersed with some atmospheric breaks and melodies. The only problems I have are that the production is a little weak (the sound quality is a bit flat,) and Peach's vocalist- while he doesn't necessarily have a bad voice- doesn't have much range. Other than that, I recommend picking up a copy, especially for Tool fans. Some of Justin's bass riffs sound like they'd work great in a Tool song... I guess that's why he's playing with them now."
3,Peach-not Tool,"If you are buying this album because of Tool's remake of ""You Lied"", I think you'll be fairly disappointed as I was. The overall sound of it had a grunge-ish drive to it more like Tool's Opiate but just lesser quality. The lead's voice doesn't compare anywhere near Maynard's. The artwork is decent, nothing to brag about. It isn't an entire waste of money for any die-hard Tool fan, but it definitely isn't worth the investment if you're just curious. I recommend listening somewhere else before purchasing."
4,GREAT,"OK, i'm no fan of Tool, maybe thats why my opinion is clerer for Peach. This albumn is awesome, catchy beats, ""diferent"" vocals, and interesting lyrics ""Catfood"" especially. Although some tracks definatley stand out more than others, alkl the songs are good, my favourites..Naked, Peach, You Lied and Catfood. Check this out even if your not a fan of Tool, well worth it."
4,"Great music, shakey vocals","I was really interested in picking up this cd after reading about it. The tool comparison's have to be there. I mean, it's Justin's previous band, Adam did the cover art (amazing) and they toured with tool in Europe. The music on this cd is very solid. Many layers build on each other with each musician showing his given prowess. The vocals on the other hand, make me take this cd out every time before I get to track 5. Something about this dude's voice just kills me. Could just be me."
3,They don't sound like TOOL at all,"I am a TOOL fan and I must admit that the only reason I picked this CD up is because I read about it on the TOOL website. But I personally don't think they sound much alike and I really don't like Peach very much. As everyone seems to agree, the vocals are very weak and monotonous. The lead singer can hardly be understood and when he can, he can be heard mindlessly droning on and on. The rest of the band has great potential, as we've seen with Justin Chancellor. And that's not to say that the lead singer doesn't, he just doesn't show any potential outwardly.Anyway, the main reason that I wrote this review was to ask you all to stop saying ""If you like the band TOOL, you'll love Peach."" You are only saying that because TOOL recomends you pick up this CD on their website. They really can't be compared."
3,Not as effective on wheels with flat spokes,"Pros:- Sturdy- Easy to grip- Snap together design is niceCons:- They have a notch on one side so that one tire lever can be hooked onto a spoke and the other used to remove the rest of the tire from the rim. My spokes are flat instead of round, so I cannot hook the tire lever onto a spoke. Would be nice if they made the notch a little wider."
3,Not suitable for small diameter tires,"Tried to use this to change a tire on razor e200 and found it Too difficult. Probably works well for large diameter cycle tires, but not small ones. For small tires, I think the Pedro's Downhill tire lever would be much better suited."
5,Good quality plastic and good functional design,Heavy plastic which is built to last. I've had to change my 700x25 tires 3 times this past summer and these levers worked well each time. I make sure these are always in my bike bag before I hit the road!
4,Rock Solid & Effective,"I got a set of these tire levers to replace some small black (brand unknown) tire levers I had used previously. The small black ones bent precipitiously during every use and each broke over the course of about 6 uses.These Pedro's levers, by comparison, are rock solid and work just as well. They have an ""I-Beam"" structure that gives them good rigidity and are made out of a thick, durable plastic. They snap together for storage, and generally do what you'd want tire levers to do. Recommended."
4,Thick but durable.,"After having gone through 2-3 different sets of levers and breaking or bending the crap out of every one of them, I settled on the Pedro's and haven't looked back. These are a bit on the thick side, but they work great. I've been stranded because of broken tire levers and these haven't ever let me down."
5,like magic,"These two little pieces are plastic are like magic. They make removing the tire off the rim very easy. It only has 2, compared to others with 3, but 2 is enough. They click tight together so you won't lose them in pieces. I attempted to use fingers before this and it required lots of effort with no results."
5,Love Pedro's tire irons,"These irons are great. Very durable, and very light. Also, they're really inexpensive. I've had them for a while not and I am extremely pleased."
2,Funny,I think this bumper sticker is funny. Only bad thing is it doesn't Stick very well to the bumper!! Might be better off taping it into your back window.It stuck alright on the bumper until it rained! But it's still alright.
1,Low Quality Pants,These pants have a very course scratchy feel. They are going straight to goodwill.
2,Not worth it,I got these to plug the kreg pockets in my deck railing and they wouldn't stay in. I even tried gluing them in and nothing worked. I finally gave up. I think the holes look better than the plugs anyway... Don't waste your money.
3,Plus & Minus,Gama Sonic GS-80 Solar Charged Address LightGama Sonic GS-80 Solar Charged Address LightGama Sonic GS-80 Solar Charged Address LightPlus - We live on a dark street. A neighbor called 911 one night which got a fire engine in front of our house so they could get a bearing on the street address ranges since our Solar Address Light was the only address visible.Minus - It doesn't take direct sunlight well. Ours is mounted on the provided stakes in the ground in front of the house. The numbers have yellowed and the thin plate that holds the numbers has warped allowing the numbers to fall out of place. I would recommend if you purchase this product that it be mounted on the house where it is a little better protected from the elements.
1,debra spencer,This product stopped working within 3 months. The plastic is cheap and falls out. Definately not a product to ever buy.
4,house sign,2nd sign actually works well. The green letters glow very well giving excellent visibility at night. Only problem is the plastic is now discoloring. We live in Sunny Florida and the plastic is taking a real beating.Maybe someone will offer a metal sign that won't discolor
2,PR piece?,"Hesh Kestin's book was given to all Computer Associates employees when it was published. It is a look at a company that has a fairly strange internal culture. There is a breathless, tabloid quality to much of the writing, and you will not find much analysis here. On the other hand, it is a more measured source of information than the occasional article and postings on various chat and/or message boards."
3,Only if you really need..,"the Duo tap for the tg-16 /turbo duo systems allows you to connect up to 5 controllers to your system at a single time...its a good idea for people that have games that require more one player... bottom line, if you have a turbo grafx 16 this is something you should have on hand just in case..this can also be used on the import systems"
4,Wonderful!,"Not historically as accurate as Pharaoh/Cleopatra (building pyramids into New Kingdom, for instance) , but really fun nonetheless. Graphics are wonderful, without being gory. Anyone purchasing this product needs to participate in the user forums for additional scenarios and support."
2,Not Pharoh,Wanted something like pharoh but i guess i was dreaming cause this game is nothing like it. Never again will i think something could come close to it.
2,Love Game--Hate the glich that makes my computer restart.,"I love playing this game, but it makes my computer restart itself. I have searched for a fix, but as this is an English version, I have not been able to find one. So sad, Too Bad!!!"
5,Very Good!,3D is sooo much nicer than 2! This game was great1 Of course it takes longer to do things- it's more realistic. Buy it-it's worth it!
4,Enjoyable and stimulating!,"I've played numerous simulation and strategy games, but none have impressed me as much as 'Children of the Nile'. The graphics is in 3D with excellent detail and you have complete control over the camera views. Zoom down and watch your 'children' move from place to place carrying wares, soldiers running to the training grounds or watching the 'children' dance in the streets.I had a very hard time walking away from the game once I got started and the more I played, the more experienced I became at managing the senarios.There are a few minor flaws, such as clipping, or some annoying 'stuck' children, but the technical support has been awesome! They were very receptive to the customer and quickly provided fixes after the game was released.If you loved Pharaoh and Cleopatra, you'll LOVE this game."
1,Do not buy download,I purchased the download version. When the functions related to right clicking stopped working in the tutorial I went looking for a patch. Found a patch and downloaded it but when I tried to install the patch it refused and told me I had an unknown edition. Sad because it looked like a fun game.
2,I should have listened. . .,"Believe the other reviews. This game is slow, both in gameplay and processing speed. It's mostly hurry-up and wait, and there's not too much to occupy your time while accumulating bricks. Take my advice and go get Pharaoh or Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom. They're a bit older, but they're a whole lot more fun."
5,Nice and simply put...,This is the book I've been looking for... Wish I could place it in all classrooms across the U.S.
2,Interesting,"I don't really know what to say about this book. It's shocking and sad. It has summaries of horrible pogroms and covert ops gone really bad. I think the presentation just wasn't as good as I expected. The book even seems a little emotional. Granted, the author is talking about issues that are sensitive and morally significant. It just appears frustration gets the best of him sometimes in the book and that makes his ""objectivity"" suspect."
5,Excellent customer service,"My item was not available due to unfortunate circumstances. The staff was upfront about what happened, and they contacted me right away. I really appreciate the frankness and professionalism."
5,Luminous and refreshing,"This is a beautiful book that explores learning and mentorship in the broadest human and existential context, and draws fresh insights from this approach. Liu investigates the interaction between great teachers and their pupils not only from the standpoint of their particular craft, but the broader story of how teacher and pupil find themselves brought together, change each other as human beings, and eventually go their separate ways. It shows us how teaching can be not just a 9 to 5 gig, but perhaps the activity that shows our distinct human-ness better than any other. Anyone with interests in education and mentorship, or who has been touched by a teacher of the past, would see in this book a reflection of themselves."
5,"A ""must read"" for children ages 4 to 104!","This book sent chills up my spine! I read it to my children, gave it to my Godchild as a gift, passed it around my bible study class, and gave it to my 21-year-old brother. If you ever wonder how much God really loves you, just open this book for a great reminder. The book gently explains to children that God gives us the ""choice"". He knows every decision we make before we make it. And He is right there beside us, whether we make a good decision or bad decision. Everytime I read it I find something new. While the book is written for children, it's a must read for every adult. This book reminds us that God is just one prayer away, and all we have to do is ask, no matter how much trouble we get ourselves into. Absolutely incredible."
4,"a great, simple childrens book","The book is wonderfully simple in its depiction of God's love. While it is certainly geared toward children, its message can touch adults. .................. a book that can be read out-loud in under ten minutes."
4,"Good, but it's missing a very special detail.","You can't deny the love that this book protrays. It is very warm and comforting. The analogy was good, but it was missing a very special character, Jesus. Shaddai represents God the Father, the children represent mankind, and the dark forest represents sin. These are all good representations. However, I would liked to have seen Shaddai have a Son who guides the lost boy back to the Father. ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" I don't think that you can adequately represent the love of the Father if you omit His Son."
2,Troubling Vision of the Kingdom,"This alleghory of sin, free will, and love is troubling to me on many levels. The primary concern I have is that the village that Shaddai builds is populated solely with white children. While many may protest that this is political correctness run amok, I'd hate to share with a child a vision of God's kingdom that only included white persons. In a book published in the year 2000, this is deeply troubling."
1,What a horrible story,"Build a wall around the village to trap the kids in? Because you love them?!? If you love them, take them out to the forest and let them explore, with you there to protect them. Don't wall them in. I pity the children raised by parents who believe this is a good lesson."
2,Dolled-up Bible Nonsense,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. My first impression, just glancing at it after she unwrapped it, was that it was too wordy for a younger audience but it had some pretty nice illustrations. Then I read some of it. I have to say, I don't want my daughter thinking its okay for a commune of young children to live and be trapped by an older man who is always with them. Nor do I want her to think it's wrong to be curious, or that it's bad. Children learn best through exploring their curiosity, and this book almost detriments that. It's dressed up bible nonsense. Beware."
3,Books are hard to read when drunk.,"While my old job required me to be up to date regarding the procurement of federal funds, my new job (the one where I sit on the couch all day and while my wife belittles me for not being a provider) does not. That being said, I once saw a cat eat poop.This book is good though. If you like, you know, boring books, or grants. I guess grants are good too. I can't tell because the pink giraffe next to me is laughing so hard I can't hear myself think.Where did I put that donkey? He had my chips, dammit!In conclusion,Grants is good! Buy book...PSThe donkey has not yet returned. Send chips"
2,Don't be fooled,"I purchased this album because I like Lucky Thompson's sound and AllMusic lists the date for this recording as 1957, a great time for small group jazz. No way. I have lots of jazz recordings from this period and none of them even hint at tinker bell piano and rubberband bass. This is 70's music which does not have the honest feel of the music produced during the best years for jazz. This album sounds like it could be from the CTI catalog..a no no in my book."
3,Ok for quick sweeps,"This stick vacuum is great for quick pick up of dog hair and small items. Good thing it comes with 2 batteries because even when not in use, the battery power drains on it's own."
3,Batteries are great.,"The charge on these batteries is good. It picks up pet hair very well, but not so well anything much heavier than that."
4,easy to use,"This is my first ""Stick"" vacuum. I am surprised at how well it works.. Gets the corners and under furniture so much better than my upright. Definite flaw in the handle design as mentioned in other reviews. The handle feels whimpy for the weight of the unit."
4,LOVE IT!,I really LOVE is little sweeper. Easy to assemble easy to use ..nice for quick pick ups from dog and his daddy ...... From a 68 year old women this is GREAT!
3,good for small jobs,Good for small jobs and quick clean upsI would buy a more powerful one if i could find one. Its not the best or the worst.
5,Quick up is right,Great little vac. Just what I needed for quick cleanup daily. Works like a charm! Battery doesn't go dead as fast as the last one I had (different brand). Lightweight so I can carry it from room to room. I love it!!
1,a real dog,"I purchased this vacuum cleaner at the beginning of September on the basis of good reviews from Amazon purchasers. I planned to use it as a quick pick-up on my kitchen's tile floor (crumbs etc.). It has proved to be a great disappointment. The batteries don't hold a charge at all, so after less than 5 minutes you find yourself pushing around a vacuum that makes a low moaning sound & picks up nothing. There's $60 down the drain. My advice to would-be purchasers: caveat emptor, & hold on to the packaging so you can return it if your experience is like mine"
5,"Just what I wanted, good battery life","Just what I wanted, great battery life and an xtra bettery that I have never needed because of poor charge"
4,Works,"Handy little vac. The carpete function is just a mock up as it only turns on the rotary brush, so I also turn it on on hard floors.Works fine give"
5,Great little vac,this is great little vac for the price and with it's two batteries make it even better. I had this very vac b4 and was sad when the batteries died(had for some years). I found this one on line and was so happy that I did.
4,Good VAC,"The vacuum is light weight, and picks up dirt and hair quite well. It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base. The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws. I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years. The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging, but it's designed for wall hanging, and it slides on the counter, and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
4,almost perfect,"I read a ton of reviews for this type of vacuum, and settled on this on. It has plenty of power and battery life for what I need, picking up kitty litter and dust bunnies from hard floors. The only thing I would like different is the detachable hand vac has the wide bottom with the roller bar attached (not sure what that part is called). I would like to be able to remove that from the hand vac, like the original Dustbuster. That is a minor point, however. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, in fact I have!"
4,Very satisfied,"My friend told me about this vaccuum, that it worked great on hardwood floors. She recommended this product very enthusiastically so I tried it. So far, so good! Thanks! :) Melissa"
3,"A first record, good in places...","William Ackerman was working as a house builder back in the mid-70s in the region that is now called Silicon Valley. He played guitar on the side. He wrote a number of tunes and his friends kept telling him he should release a record. So, he started his own record label and issued this record.Obviously inspired by John Fahey (especially in the song titles) this is pure solo guitar music. It is not my favorite record by Will Ackerman. There are some very nice moments (and tunes) here but overall, its just not brilliant. His next two records (It Takes a Year, and Childhood and Memory) are vastly superior.I'm very glad Will made this record, started Windham Hill and gave up construction in favor of music. However, that doesn't make this a great record."
1,Save your money,"Far from being ""a full historical treatment"" as the publisher's blurb claims, this is a dreary academic treatise which barely skims the surface. And the price is outrageous - $65.00 for 224 small pages. Look elsewhere!"
1,I never received it.,"I payed for the item never received it, and when I tried to get ahold of amazon I never received a responce. I'm still waiting for this product."
1,Trying to be everything...End up with nothing,"This deserves a negative rating. I haven't seen this band live in about 3 years because it is obvious they are more concerned with being ""rock stars"" than writing and performing the music that made 'Maize', the EP, and half of 'Pushmonkey' great. If you loved their self-titled album go buy 'Maize' which is thankfully getting re-released. The thing that upsets me the most about this band is that they used to play a bunch of awesome songs live that never made it on 'Pushmonkey'. I figured that maybe they were holding those tunes back for this release but it seems that they've decided to join the ranks of every nu-metal act out there instead. Oh well, at least we get a live recording of ""Rednose"" on the re-release of 'Maize'.Please don't buy El Bitche. You'd only be encouraging them to make more garbage like this."
2,Hybrid Bitche,"We're Creed, no wait we're Linkin Park, no..In either case definite a sub-par version."
1,Stopped working,"Stopped working on the 3rd card I plaqced in it, in the middle of a wedding. Am returning."
1,Raingauge,I bought this to replace a similar raingauge. When I received it I noticed that the numbers on the gauge are about 1/4 inch big and just stamped in the plastic. No paint or anything to make them standout. The gauge only sits about 6 feet from my house but I can't see how much rain we have had unless I go out (with my glasses on) and look at it. My old one (similar in appearance) I could read from in the house. This one is hard to read with my glasses on and holding it in my had. I would not this type again.
3,Clear Vu Rain Gauge 2700,The first plastic tube cracked and leaked after a freeze. The second one is working fine in warmer weather. Watch out for ice accumulaation in the tube!! GW
5,A must have; undervalued gem.,"I first heard Jodelle on a web radio, then decided to buy her CD online. Overall, her music is excellent; every song brings a different but complementary theme and music. At times, I found musical traces of Evanescence without the metal. If you enjoy soft rock, this is a great CD to own."
1,ZERO STARS! UNLISTENABLE!!,"This is just unlistenable. Transfers are from warped discs, broken discs, discs with different sound levels, even allowing for stage action...DO NOT GET!"
5,Can't ask for better.,"I saw the book I wanted, I looked for the best price/shape used book.It said this book was in great shape, and it is!!!This is my favorite kind of purchase, by the time you think about it, the shipment is on the porch."
4,Another great book by Patrick Jennings,"I absolutely love this book, really couldn't put it down! Like ""Faith and the Rocket Dogs"" and ""Faith and the Electric Cat"", this book inspires further reseach while being completely intertaining. I wasn't a reader as a kid and at 39 I am really enjoying books written for a younger audience. Both for myself and to read aloud to my not yet reading kids. This book is as wildly imaginitive as Holes but with so much more researched detail. I think kids will learn so much from reading this book and want to know more about some things in the story that they may not be familial with. It is the story of a boy and his mom who move into a new building as a result of a rent increase and the things they learn about The Beastly Arms. For more you'll have to read the book."
3,Why is such a charming recording lacking Liner Notes?,Markavitch does a wonderful job playing these little gems but Starlight Music fails to enlighten the listener with liner notes about the composers involved and the circumstances of their composition. Marco Polo and Naxos would have done a better job of releasing this material on their own labels!
2,Not Good,"Double Game has a good idea of the cop who goes around at night shooting up the bad guys. This movie is just not good. The acting is bad in Italian or English. I fell asleep watching it, the pace is not quick. The other DVD is of the sequel, is a better plot but all the same actors from the first movie are in this one but in different roles. Low budget Italian crime films of the 70's. Some are good others aren't. A star for each movie."
2,Terrible sound quality.,"This happens to be one of my favorite albums. (I won't explain that here!) So I was very excited to see it had finally come out on CD. Two tracks from it were released on the Columbia/Legacy compilation ""Painted Dayglow Smile"" in '92 and they sounded great so you can imagine my disappointment when I heard this disk. It sounds like it was mastered off of a bad cassette copy. I don't know what the source material for the Columbia/Legacy disk was but it was far, far superior. Too bad. I don't suppose they'll ever get around to remastering this record 'cause its limited market probably won't warrant it. If this label (Scorpio) ever rereleases any more titles by this duo I hope they take a little more time and care with the product."
4,Better than I expected...,"After I read the other reviews here I decided to pass on this one. Then my wife got it for me anyway. I definitely hear the audio difference when compared to the Columbia compilation mentioned above, but I think that cd was remixed by Bob Irwin, which puts it in a whole other category. The songs here are great. C&J had a unique sound. Pick this one up. I'd also recommend their Distant Shores CD."
3,Consider this one,"With the exception of their greatest hits collection, this is the only disc by Chad & Jeremy I'd recommend. Most of the songs were originally done by someone else, but it's nice to hear C&J's interpretation. I'll never understand why the title song wasn't a bigger hit."
5,Another Slice of British Invasion Heaven!,"If you, like me, are the avid collector of all things British Invasion related; then this album is a MUST... Chad & Jeremy earned a rightful place in the Hall of Fame of the Brit period of the 60's... Their voices melded perfectly and the songs were picked to perfection... Let these beautiful pop tunes bathe your senses and take you back to the wonderful 60's and if you weren't around at the time then let this fine collection be a part of your British Invasion 101 course... Oh yeah.. get it before it becomes extinct... this puppy seems like it won't be in production for much longer... I'm glad I've got a copy!"
5,Too Cute!,"This outfit is too cute! It's great quality material and it fits great. The only problem is that the feather on the hat came off, but I can fix that very easily. I love this costume and I would recommend getting it even if the feather might fall off. :)"
2,"Not bad, but left me unhappy, not good conclusion to Harpers","I enjoyed this book until the end. Cunningham did not exhibit the ""Invincible Hero(oine) Syndrome"" displayed often with Arilyn Moonblade. There are many interesting characters and an interesting plot (not on the level of Elfsong or Elfshadow, though). What made me unhappy was the treatment of the paladin and of Khelben Arunsun. The apparent dislike of authority mentioned by an above reviewer was ugly. This book was the end to a franchise and what it disastrously left out was a sense that the ideals fought for by the Harpers will live on in the Realms, even though the book series has ended."
3,Not Her Best Work,"I am a huge Elaine Cunningham fan, but this book just didnt cut it. It seems like it was over edited because it gets very choppy when you jump from seen to seen in just a few pages. I like reading more about Khelban, but the rest of the characters were either dense or coldhearted. I recomend any of her dark elf books over this one."
1,Characters with no honour at all bring this down,"I bought this book with some enthusiasm. I expected that it would be pretty intresting with a ""Thief"" type character. At first I did like Bronwyn, but midway through and especially in the latter half, she just struck me as totally selfish and having no sense of honour. I'm not sure if the treatment of the Paladin, Algorind, was meant to be funny or not, but I thought the way the protagonists regarded him to be atrocious. The only characters who I felt any sympathy for were Algorind and Dag Zoreth, who I found intriguing. This book could have been good overall if Bronwyn had not grated me the wrong way so much, and if in fact she is represenative of current Harpers then the fact then this being the last book is indeed a good thing."
4,Historical analysis at its best.,"Mr.W.H.Lewis, brother of Mr.C.S., projects his fondness for the 17th century with bravado in The Splendid Century. The word splendid, derived from the latin for ""illuminated"", allows the reader to understand his thesis of the Grand Siecle without turning a page, by simply judging the book by its cover. Here is a profoundly pious Christian man composing some of the most glorious prose about a controvertial subject and succeeding where so many others have failed.By not limiting himself to Versailles Mr.Lewis creates honesty. But he does not stop there, he remains true to the popular understanding. The Sun King's world brought to life."
4,Good overview of France during Louis XIV's reign,"This book gave an excellent overview of the country, including the life of the king, those who lived at Versailles, nobility in the countryside, the poor, women, etc. Very well written and well structured. This is a great introduction for someone who is interested in really understanding a large-scale picture of the century, without getting too bogged down in details. However, it still feels very academic in nature so while a fascinating read, this is not ""light"" reading."
5,The writing is as splendid as the century,"The kind of full-bodied, flowing writing which makes a time and place come alive for the reader."
3,"Not bad, but not as funny as I expected","I sit on Youtube while reading this book so I can hear the songs has I am reading the comments on it. Most of the songs I've heard before, but it really just helps to hear the songs too. I dont know... Some of the author's comments were out of the ballpark funny that I would repeat them to my boyfriend and we'd laugh about them... but then some were just mediocre... For $.01 plus shipping, the book was worth my time and money, but I wouldn't necessarily buy this new, nor will I probably buy his other books. I don't know; I haven't finished it yet. It's not exactly a page turner for me. This is a book you can definitely put down."
5,HYSTERICAL CURE FOR DEPRESSION,"It's this simple; turn to page 131 and read author Tom Reynolds' take on Celine Dion's cover of ALL BY MYSELF. If you laugh so hard your eyes tear up, you have a great sense of humor and this book is for you. I promise you this feeling will be repeated regularly throughout your reading.If you do not find this chapter absolutely hysterical and dead-on, proceed to re-read Sylvia Plath and rest easy the people ""get"" your black clothing fashion statement."
4,you may not be that familiar with most of his selections,"A humorous collection and analysis of some of the most depressing songs released over the last 50 years. Reynolds not only has a knack for breaking down songs to their core, but he also does it in a way that you'll be laughing along with him, even though the songs author's were probably dead serious when they wrote them. Reynolds' breaks the songs down into various categories of depression. The only problem I had with his choice of songs were that they were based around Reynolds' childhood. So unless your a music fanatic, or born around his age range, you may not be that familiar with most of his selections. A great book either way."
1,TOO TIGHT FOR ADULTS,"I have no idea how this product is rated ""medium adult.""I'm a slim guy with thin bones and could not wear this elbow pad!"
3,"Nice product, but size is smaller than they say","Nice product but size is smaller than advertised. I measured my wife's arm at 16"" circumference and bought the ""regular size"" which was supposed to be ~17"" fully extended. It was way too small. I think it would have torn before it stretched to 17"". I'd estimate it would have been tight but comfortable on a 15"" arm. Other than that it seemed like a good product. I'll let you know when I get my XL pair. ;)"
1,Waste of Time,"""Gotta Do My Time"" is not worth the time it takes to watch it. The video is a loose historical exploration of Dylan's career which includes roughly the period of the late 1970s through 1989. It mostly consists of snippets of interviews by journalists and a few musicians. Some of the musicians offer a bit of insight into the recording of some of Dylan's material. There are a few clips of Dylan performing. However, the video is corrupted by the bloated opinions of journalists who (despite their self-proclaimed status as ""Dylan experts"") seem to have only listened to his records once before dismissing them. Their opinions are seemingly based on little more than their own personal ""taste."" Little effort is expended by these ""experts"" to understand Dylan's work. Their approach to Dylan's work seems better suited to the gossip column of a teen magazine."
3,An Average Romantic Tale,"This is a fairly quick read, with a predictable story. I read the entire book in a day, but wished my next order from Amazon had already arrived. The main characters, Chloe and Dominic, simply don't have much to distinguish them from hundreds of other love-struck regency Brits constrained by social mores and convention. Aside from the main story of their mutual seduction, there is the sub-plot of how Dominic will prove that his uncle is a killer and traitor to the Crown. ...Yawn..."
3,Just enough,"I have read almost all of the Boscastle series and while some gripe that there isn't enough character development, I find Hunters books just right. No, there isn't a whole lot of character development or musings on motivation and the like, but sometimes I'm not in the mood for that and so I find Hunter fits the bill when I need something light and fun and sexy.This book was just enough for what I wanted. Chloe and Dominic never really connected on a mental level, more physically than anything else, but I was okay with that. If you want something fun and easy and sexy, then this is for you. If you want something in-depth, skip it."
3,"Green Day..I mean The Queers ""Live""!","I am a big fan of this band. Their Ramones meets the Beach Boys via Johnny Thunders sound makes them one of the best punk rock bands on the planet. This album, however sounds like a Green Day bootleg. When you parents would say ""all their songs sound the same"", but as a real fan you could tell the difference and simply laughed your parents opinions off. Well I am a fan and all the songs do sound the same! Very lite on Joe's killer lead guitar too which is one of the bands strong points. If it wasn't for the vocals this could easily be a Green Day cd.For die-hard fans only."
4,Good Value for Money,"The Stamina is definitely not a Bowflex, but then I can't afford a Bowflex. I really like the sliding seat for doing rowing type exercises. The Stamina wasn't too hard to assemble, but there were some quality issues with the parts that I had to correct to get everything to fit together. My main complaint is the difficulty in changing the resistance bands. Much of this was taken care by cutting off the plastic safety clips -- they really aren't needed. There were also quality issues with the length of the ropes not being even, which I had to correct by knoting one. However, overall I'm pleased with the value."
5,home gym,This is a wonderful gym. It is similar to the boflex but without the HIGH pricetag. Delivery was very fast. I am very satisfied!!
3,Poor Mans universal gym,This is a cheap universal gym but it fits in the narrow space I had available. Everything about it is cheap and cheaply made. It uses bungy cords but they stretch with age and will need to be replaced after only about a year and a half. It's not a bowflex but takes up less room.
2,Consumerism glorified,"What a frightening view of the world, and of women, this book presents - consumerism glorified and magnified to the nth degree. I find it sad that anyone could see the world, women, and women's relationships purely in terms of pushing products. Endless materialism and consumption aren't qualities that the world needs, and therefore I found this book a rather sickening read. Its two stars are because, to be fair, she certainly knows her stuff, even if that stuff strikes some of us as the stuff of nightmares!"
1,marketing fan,"I don't write many reviews and usually I can always find something educational or enjoyable about a book. This was so poorly written, I couldn't even finish it. So much silly jargon without any valuable substance. I'd hate for someone else to waste their money! The book is basically an advertisement for Faith Popcorn's marketing firm...but a really bad one!"
2,Couldn't get through it,"Let me start by saying that normally I'm a big Popcorn fan. I read any article that she's quoted in. I've read ""The Popcorn Report"" at least twice and loved it. The same for ""Clicking."" Great book. They're part of my permanent library.So I was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of EVEolution. I hung in there as long as I could, but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way. I just couldn't tolerate reading any more.Perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people's view, but I didn't see how they fit in with the intent of the book. The comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary.So hopefully her next book will be better."
4,Excellent insights into the future of consumerism in America,"This book is a very good resource for anyone looking to keep current with what's next in marketing, or for people starting a new business. It's the ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" for business!"
1,Spin over substance,"EVEolution is a case of spin over substance. Popcorn and Marigold's incessant jargon creation (FutureScape, TrendProbe, SocioQuake, EVEsdropping) rob their ideas of any real power. Once past the packaging, it quickly becomes clear that EVEolution is built on a shaky assumption. Popcorn and Marigold argue that ""Women don't buy brands; they join them."" While some of the techniques described in the book are innovative and even interesting, they ignore the simple fact that women are smart enough to know the difference between an invitation to ""join"" and a sales pitch."
1,Faith Popcorn is very entertaining,"Put simply, this book is to marketing what astrology is to astronomy. Basically Faith Popcorn seems to sit down at a cafe, watch people do things and randomly interpret it into a ""trend"". I know this is not supposed to be a master thesis, but you need a little bit more than a vivid imagination to write a serious book.Here's a bonus trend: 4 out of five MBA's from my class thought the Faith Popcorn site was a humour site."
5,Blew My Mind,"Ok fellow rivetheads, lets face it, we've been bombarded with a lot of crap in our genre the past few years. future-pop came and got old in less than a year. ebm isn't even ebm anymore. trance has polluted our music for way too long and it's time for a change. And after listening to Das Ich's new album, I'm starting to get some hope. Growling vocals, great, hard beats, unbelievable synths and sequences. This album is freaking wicked. The opening track Uterus is the highlight of the album to me. I wasn't sure of it when I first heard it, but then the chorus came up. BAMMMM!!! Wicked, wicked song. I can't say this is Das Ich's best album, but it's totally worth buying."
3,Overpriced and stains,"The kite does fly in a breeze, but is way overpriced and stains easily.The stick holding the wings comes loose, even at under 20 mph breeze,."
4,"Great CD, but not that Great.","When I was still searching for new music that could elevate my soul to newer heights, I came across this band. I listened to a couple of tracks online and went out and bought the CD. It's a good CD but for some reason it didn't have too much replay value to me...this cd is not for real metal fans...this is more for nu-metal people or people who are into Slipnot. I'm in no way trying to belittle people here...we just all have our own groups."
4,The loudest band I have ever heard. Period.,"These guys are awesome live. If you think you know what loud is, wait til you get a chance to see them. My ears rang for days afterward. And that is a good thing, because their music should be played as loud as possible. I've seen them twice, once with Fear Factory, and once with Slipknot. They blew them both away. I thought the buildings would collapse. Paint chips were falling off the ceiling. Anyway, if you like extreme music, you'll do well to give these guys a shot. Lots of great songs with brutally heavy verses and some more melodic choruses."
5,Awesome,this is one of the top 5 metal bands today easily. This album is killer. This band should receive a bit more recognition. 90% of the album is great and thats about 85% more than most bands today. My one problem is that they havent released another album in 3 years but thats because of a dispute with their label so they signed with another label. American Head Charge is sick and anyone who thinks other wise needs a beat down. Look for their new album 10.04.04
3,Album Not So Seamless After All...,"American Head Charge exploded into my life by way of the 'Pledge of Allegience Tour' - their single release, 'Just So You Know' was played in high rotation on MTV,therefore, I felt compelled to buy this album (such brainwashing of the masses). Although I loved various tracks on the album ('Seamless', 'Just So You Know', 'A Violent Reaction'), the album itself leaves me wanting more from it every time. Although the production is tight, at times, songs are muddy and clarity is lost...this album has it's moments, but I don't think I would purchase it again."
5,one of a kind cd!,"American Headcharge is one of the best and most exciting bands to come around these days. Very original, awesome vocals (Martin Cock is one of a kind!)From start to finish this cd will blow you away! Recommended tracks are Just So You Know, Seamless, All Wrapped Up,Americ**t,Never Get Caught.All are recommended.Their follow up release ""The Feeding"" is just as good if not better! Buy it!"
2,Nu-Metal repeats itself again and again and again.....,"Unfortunately, although they have a slightly different sound to most nu-metal bands due to the inclusion of some fairly impressive industrial-oriented samples, there's relatively little to set this band apart from the rest of the bands included in the genre. Like Slipknot, they have 'screamy' vocals along with some mediocre clean vocals. The musicianship is very basic, most of the songs being comprimised of power chords, drop D playing and simple, linear drumming. As with the rest of the genre, there are no guitar solos at all in this album which to fans like myself is a huge let-down.If you're not too picky about what you listen to and can stand more of the same old, watered-down metal, go for it. But it's not an album I frequently listen to. Nice try AHC - just try a little harder next time."
1,More proof nu metal is going the way of hair metal,Let's see...this is like...40 releases this year that if they didn't happen nu metal might still be original. This pile of stink is basically Korn wannabes playing covers of Slayer of course minus the talent...all we need is one band like Nirvana to get rid of Nu Metal...I think that band might be Dredg.
1,"The ""Four Year"" Yawn","I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words ""four years"" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed."
2,Still Waiting,"I, like other readers, used to be a Danielle Steel junkie. I couldn't wait for the next book. Like the others, I have been disappointed repeatedly in the last 10 or so years. The writing style, credibility, and repetition, especially of the ""absolutes,"" (all, never, every, very...) is mediocre and at times annoying. Character development is predictable from book to book and generally unrealistic. I too hoped that this book would be better, but found myself searching for more depth as I read. Maybe the next one will be better.........."
3,The House is half empty!,"While much better than her last 10 books, this book is not up to the quality of the Ms. Steel's earlier books. Realism - NOT. A female attorney, who does not join her pitiful boyfriend in the gym- does a majority of the remodel work herself, but never once complains of a sore muscle or blister? The 3 story house is empty of furniture save the bedroom and kitchen, yet never once do we hear of echoes. The reader hopes for hidden treasures from the past, other than one photo, but nothing. As for editing, any high school student knows not to end sentences with prepositions - has this basic rule been lifted to placate an ego?"
2,Boring,"I always liked Danielle Steel but this book was terrible. It was very repetitive, had at least 2 sentences that were not complete and did not make sense. Someone else found misspelled words. And, the ending, what a let down. More focus should have been on the couple and their happiness. It felt like Danielle got tired and just brushed it off. Very disappointing."
4,A Gem Spanning Four Generations,"I have read Danielle Steele before, but never to this effect. To borrow her own term, it's a gem of a novel. Acts of kindness proliferate to defeat the evil ones and help love to triumph. The focus on a mansion in San Francisco and the attorney who takes it through probate and new ownership, finding love in the process, works very well. Some creative paragraphing, punctuation, and reiteration are only minor distractions from an ingenious plot and wonderful cast of characters spanning four generations."
3,A Very Disappointing Read!,"I think that I have read almost every book that Danielle Steele has written. Some have been excellent and some poor. This book meets in the middle. The book starts out very slowly. Over and over we are told about Sarah being in a long term, but very minimal relationship with Phil. She decides to buy a old house and fix it up with the proceeds from an inheritence. From the book jacket I thought...OK...this might be good. I was so wrong. There were too many loose ends. Sarah goes to France to see where her great-great grandmother ran off too many years ago. There were opportunities to get some answers about the lives of these people but the threads were just dropped. I do have to say that by the middle of the book, it became more interesting. I was happy that Sarah ended up happy but if you change the names of the characters in the book you have to same old tired Danielle Steel book."
2,Another repetitive Novel by Danielle,Daniel should take her time and write ONE good book rather than turning out typiccal novels like this one. She repeats content so many times it left me frustrated and bored! Typical boy meets girl story. I will pass on Danielle for a long time unless she can do MUCH better than this!
2,Danielle Steele Needs to Retire,"There was a time in my life that Danielle Steele was my favorite author. I even named my daughter after her 20 years ago. However, she is living on her laurels now and really should retire. Her novels are not much better than what a high school student could write. She overuses words such as ""she loved that about him."" ""she loved how he did this.."" and so forth. With ""The House"", by the third chapter, it was as if she thought her reading audience did not have enough sense to realize that Phil was not good for the heroine. She had to keep beating our heads with it, just filling up paper in order to make it long enough for a book. I doubt I will ever read another one of her novels. So sad...."
2,Ok for DS,"While this certainly wasn't her worst novel, it isn't much more than ok. I got the impression she had written an outline then filled with book with annoying, repetitive details - about the people, the house, etc. And oh, just once can't someone in her novel be happy being single??"
1,"Boring, boring","After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house. Aha, I thought, the story begins. But alas, not much happens. Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be. Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them. The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one. Where was the editor on this one? It was a bummer. Virginia"
3,I was a little disappointed,"I have read everyone of Danielle Steel's books and am a HUGE fan. However, this book was disappointing. The first few chapters were terribly boring because of the repetition. I had to skip paragraph after paragraph because I got so tired of her describing her relationship with her boyfriend. Once she finally got started with the actual story, it was good. I think this book could have easily been one of her smaller books and I would have enjoyed it more."
1,Trite and Predictable,"This is my first and last Danielle Steel book. Curious about the enthusiasm for this author, I decided to give her a try. Never before have I experienced such a constant and highly repetitious barrage of being told what characters were thinking and feeling, with so little attempt to make them come alive through their actions and words. Her attempts at character development were transparent, and the story line was trite and highly predictable and could have been told in a quarter of the time. There were many, many missed opportunities to enrich the story with details that would have made the House a more meaningful character. Steel's attempts to apply psychology to the main character's motivations were inappropriate and failed to add anything to the story. Overall it read like an outline of a story still waiting to be fleshed out and made alive. A waste of time and money, but never again."
2,"yawn, yawn...get to the point, please","I purchased this book after reading a review and I'm so sorry I did. While the idea was good, the writing was terrible. I'm no author, but even I know that repeating the same narrative (the boyfriend relationship) over and over and over again is not good writing. I felt as if Ms Steel got stuck in one place and was writing the same thing over and over again until she came up with another thought. Perhaps her editor/publisher was dogging her to write another book and she just threw this together to satisfy Delacorte Press; at any rate, it was pretty boring for the most part. I hope she takes a sabatical from writing until she can give her readers something with some life to it. I doubt that I purchase any more of her books."
5,Great book,I have read some of Danielle Steel's books and seen all of the movies based on her books. She is a great story-teller. This book touched my heart.
5,What a terrific read!,"Oh I started this last night & made myself finally stop to have a bit left for today. This is a ""gobble it up"" book. What a super story, the people are real, the house is amazing. I am going to hate to see it end today when I finish it!"
1,Most Boring Book on Record,"This is certainly the most boring book of modern times. And worse, completely senseless.How is it that people keep buying her books? And of all the reviews ever written of this one, not one reviewermentions the name of the guy who died and left the heroine her fortune. Stanley Pearlman. Not one reviewer, nor the author, nor the heroine wonders why this Jewish eccentric and recluse has left all his money to relatives who are all Christians. As is the heroine."
2,"Easy read, predictable","I have read many Danielle Steel books and this one was on the light side. I would rather she publish fewer books that have more substantial, less predictable story lines."
2,Factory ordered predictable story,"I think Danielle Steele may have a contract with her book company to write a certain amount of books per her contract, so she fulfills this obligation with this kind of factory cookie-cutter book to basically tell a story without putting much thought into the story or the characters. It's a formula story with no interesting or multi-dimensional characters. The kind of book that I totally forget soon after I've finished reading it, because there is nothing that interests or intrigues me enough to remember in this story. Not recommended - basically just a way to fill up paper."
1,Not a literary masterpiece...,"I persevered and finished this book. What a waste of time. I found myself skipping paragraphs, something I never do with a good book. It was repetitive and boring. Very disappointing."
3,Not very believable,"This book was so UNbelievable (and not in a good way) way too sappy, I felt like I had been dipped in syrup and sprinkled with sugar by the time I was done with the book. In other words, Steel tries too hard to make you feel good at the end of this one. The only admirable portion of this book is the relationship between the main character and her noncommittal boyfriend, the pain she experiences knowing he doesn't want to be there for her when she needs him is excellently portrayed."
3,This book,This is a very good book I would suggest it to anyone who who likes Patricia Cromwell. Thank you for your time
5,Very well researched...,"Everyone of the Kay Scarpetta books has left me reeling, this one took the cake on the best one so far. I being the weirdo that I am took to google maps during parts of this book. I found ""Camp Peary"", ""Williamsburg"",""I-64"", I even went so far as to look for the church that is talked about in the book. It helped me to visualize and it was just kinda cool to see it on the map, then read the book. It was quite amazing. The storyline is great has the mystery of the killer, seems like they are hunting these couples down, all the while not leaving any traces of evidence. Making you think its connected to the CIA, you find yourself rooting for Marino, who seems to be going through a hard time, rooting for the infectious relationship of Kay and Mark. All the while trying to figure out who the killer is, this book is great, has a mindblowing twist right at the end too! If you have read Patricia Cornwell before, I fully believe you'll love this one!"
4,Scarpetta Novels,"I love to read the Scarpetta novels. I am a nurse, and they really hit home and I can understand all of what is written."
2,"Little suspense, lots of filler material.",Not her most exciting book. Not very much suspense as in her other books. In the end you wonder what took her 382 pages to come to this conclusion. I recommend choosing one of her other books.
2,The lustre begins to wear off...,"""Postmortem"" and ""Body of Evidence"" were good books. ""All That Remains"" is not. It sets the pattern for the remainder of her work to date (Jan 2001): flimsy plots, poor/non-existent characterisation, awful dialogue and plain bad writing. The first two Scarpetta books showed signs of planning, thought, research and effort. None has since. This is dashed-off tosh, written too quickly with an eye on the bank balance and not on the story. Holes abound and description is poor. The pacing is usually glacial but then, just when it matters, too quick. It is not plausible as a thriller or mystery as the culprit is obvious from the get-go. Skip this and pick up Michael Connelly or John Connolly."
3,"Good Story, Lackluster Ending","First time reader of Ms. Cornwall. Well written and kept my interest, but the ending is disappointing. Although there's a bang (actually three), the story ends in a whimper. I'll try another Scarpetta story and hope for a more satisfying and convincing denouement."
3,"Not great, but okay","This is an easy to read page turner w/ lots of twists & turns. Fans of shows like CSI ought to enjoy this bk.. Forensic science is explained in fascinating detail.My problem w/ this bk. is the ending was a let down. Also, there is a scene where dogs are brought in to track the missing couple & one of the search dogs jumps back in fear. I don't think the ending explained this well."
3,Tentative Beginnings,"I have read and enjoyed a number of the Kay Scarpetta books. This was an early one that I had never read. The characters were not as fully developed, naturally, and so not the same characters I was already familiar with. That made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the book. For someone not familiar with the characters, it should be a fine read, just know that the characters become sooooo much better in the future."
3,Just OK.,"If you have read other Scarpetta books, then there is a certain comfort in familiar characters. My fundamental problem with this book was the far fetched chance encounter through which they caught the perp.."
5,All That Remains - Kay Scarpetta,"I enjoy reading books by Patricia Cornwell. Reading one on my Kindle, makes it such a pleasure - so much more comfortable. I look forward to reading more."
4,Throughly enjoyable,"I love this author's way of writing and on reading the novels I feel as if I am ""living"" them. On my keep list of authors."
3,it's ok if you have not read any other cornwell book,"predictable style...every novel involves computer language, too repetitive.....we all know she drives a Mercedes. Hold back on the Italian recipies. Otherwise, a reasonable read"
1,"Very disappointing, probably the worst book Patricia Cornwell ever wrote.","As far as I can tell, until now this was the only book by PC I hadn't read. And it should have stayed that way; I should not have bought it because it was a huge disappointment. The story seems to start with an interesting case but very soon after that it dies and turns into pages and pages of nothing. Descriptions of places that don't really matter, clothes people wear that have NO impact whatsoever on the story and the ending..... don't even get me going on that. I should have stopped around page 25 or so and started an other book.I believe this was an early 'Scarpetta' story. Almost all PC's other books kept me on the edge of my seat but this one, don't bother, it's a waste of your time. It was for my time, that's for sure."
4,One of the Better Scarpetta Novels,"""All that Remains"", chronicles M.E. Kay Scarpetta and Detective Pete Morino as they hunt to stop a murderer who hunts young couples. They are hampered by the fact that the bodies are only ever found months after the crime, making evidence scarce, and by the high-power mother of a young girl beleived to be the killer's latest victim whose hysteria threatens to ruin the case, and Scarpetta's career. The plot is a masterful blend of forensic science and Christie-quality deduction.This was an absolute pleasure to read. ""All that Remains"" isn't bogged down with the Scarpetta preoccupation with her niece's social life which ruins later books nor is she coming apart at the seams emotionally (ummm...""Black Notice"" anyone?) Cornwell's focus on the case makes for a seamless read that trully is fine thriller fiction."
3,"Not as good as other books in series, very poor ending.","All that remains is a typical Patricia Cornwell book, with intrigue, intresting characters, and intense action. But the actual storytellinng and concept of this book is hard to follow, and sometimes seems to be missing important details. The ending is very melodramitic, and frankly dissapointing for me"
3,Have no fear Kathy Reichs,"I just started reading Kathy Reichs and one of the comments inside the front cover was comparing her to Patricia Cornwell. There is no comparison, Temperance Brennan has it all over Kay Scarpetta. I am determined to finish All That Remains, but I'm not enjoying it. Love the technical aspects of both authors, but have learned much more from Kathy Reichs. Temperance is a more interesting character just by being portrayed as more human and a big plus, there is more humor in Reich's stories which is a major plus."
3,On Your Toes,"Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series continues to keep the readers on their toes in this story dealing with limited evidence and lots of excitement,"
2,Don't waste your time on this one,I picked this book up at a dollar store and was so disappointed with the story. I kept reading and waiting for something solid to happen. It didn't. I was at the end when I finally accepted the fact that the book is no good. I was so glad when I finished this and hate I wasted so much time.
3,Thrilling until you get to the end.,"This is the first book I read from this author. The book was really good and suspenceful until the end. I was really disappointed in the ending, which surprises me. The other books I have read I really liked."
4,Vintage Scarpetta,"This 1992 Kay Scarpetta novel by Patricia Cornwell concerns the killing of a series of young couples. It is vintage Scarpetta when Lucy was innocent, Marino was strong, and Kay had few self doubts. I read (reread actually) it back to back with one of Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novels and was amazed at how much more I enjoyed the earlier work. For anyone who started reading Cornwell in later years and didn't enjoy her, I would recommend this earlier work."
5,Excellent Series,I love all the Scarpetta books by Patricia Cornwell. I have the series in hardback in my bookcase to share with interested family.
5,Am reading the book now,Cornwell is an excellent author. Each book is unique while many of the same characters. Love her books!
4,All That Remains,This tape leaves you spell bound right from the start. Its awesome and a must read for anyone who loves mysteries.
4,"Good read, abrupt ending",It had been awhile since I had read one of Patricia Cornwell's books. Liked this one....as always love the character of Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta. My only dislike was the ending. It seemed a bit rushed and abrupt.
2,One of Cormwells worst,This book just dragged on and on. Endless pages that seemed to add nothing to the story. Too much of only Scarpetta. Needed more of the regular charactors Cromwell usually has in this series. I couldn't wait to be done with it.
2,Dull and Lifeless,"This is the first Patricia Cornwell I've read and, assuming it is a typical Patricia Cornwell book, I don't plan to read any of the others. People who like a writer always say, ""Oh, but you read the wrong book. You should try..."" I don't believe writers vary that much. This book had an uninteresting plot, flat characters, and no suspense whatsoever. The conversations were flat on the page, the men had no personalities except Marino whose character was delineated by his poor grammar. Scarpetta is barely interesting, but even so, I never believed for a moment that she would love someone as impersonal as Mark. I kept reading because I am a sucker."
2,A waste of time,"This book was DREADFUL. The writing is third rate (I'd quote a passage but I've already given the book away), the characters are completely unappealing (with the exception of Marino), and the conclusion is beyond anticlimactic. Truthfully, I don't understand this genre to begin with. When so many disturbing murders are taking place in the real world (e.g., Chandra Levy, Samantha Runnion) why do people want to read about people being hacked up by serial killers? Also, I don't belong to the temperance league, but these characters are constantly drinking -- hard liquor and a lot of it -- and smoking. I guess this proves that they're ""tough guys with tough jobs,"" but I don't think the local coroner should be allowed to perform autopsies while she has a hangover. This book was about as intriguing as the manual to my DVD player. Do yourself a favor -- read something else -- like the manual to your DVD player."
2,KitchenAid white plastic items are easily damaged in dishwasher,"I love the KitchenAid brand and have many KichenAid products, the oldest of which is my 25 year old standing mixer, which works flawlessly year after year. However, I am starting to notice that KitchenAid products manufactured in this white plastic are NOT dishwasher safe. I like to put measuring spoons in the dishwasher to sanitize them, and these got melted when washed, just like the blender attachment on my KitchenAid immersion blender. Since the shape of these spoons has changed, these are useless for measuring. Next time I'll buy stainless steel measuring spoons, instead of shopping by brand name and brand reputation."
4,Wonderful,"I am a fan of well written magic realism, and I highly recommend this collection, edited by Lawrence Schimel. My favs were his, Sarah Schulman, and Laura Antoniou's stories."
4,"Great read, interesting insight into Hollywood","I've read all of Ms. Kagan's books, and although this wasn't my absolute favorite (I think Blue Heaven wins that honor), I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Ms. Kagan's casual, conversational writing style draws you in, and her characters are always interesting--likable, but with flaws and weaknesses, just like all of us. No Good-Byes tells the stories of three women--a psychaiatrist and two young actresses (one successful, one aspiring)--and how their lives are connected. The story is suspenseful, the resolutions satisfying, and the plot especially interesting when it comes to Ionie, the aspiring actress, and how she changes once she is immersed in Hollywood culture. Overall, very entertaining-- a great read for the summer."
4,Ray Obiedo's Smooth Jazz Fusion & Funk,"Ray Obiedo manages to put together melodic swinging grooves that combine latin, funk & jazz-fusion into a very intoxicating mix."
4,Good advice for novice,"I usally do not write reviews, but often read them to judge if/when I will order a book. So if your reading this, then you are much like me and really want to know if it will give you the information you need to become a better networker. Well this book is great for a novice whom is trying to learn how to introduce him/herself to others and what to do with all the business cards you get at these functions. If you are looking for something just to start your creative jucies flowing then I would look no further. I would hit order and pick this book up, howver for the seasoned networker and business men/women that works in this enviroment daily. I would look else where, because you will be very vexed at this choice. Thank you and happy reading- Giovanni"
2,VHS Rip,"I love this movie and wish it were available in the US on DVD. When I saw it was available on Video on Demand I was very excited. I watched the free preview and became disappointed. This looks like a VHS rip - and not a good one, but an old VHS tape that has been watched one too many times."
1,"Hardware: Good, Software: Complete crap","Hardware installation was easy but the software was strange to say the least. It's hard to use, inconsistent, crashes, blue-screens my computer. An updated driver and TV tuner program from the LifeView website was heaps better, but it's still poor, and I still get a blue-screen about once a day. Don't go near this thing."
2,better with Patti,"I first heard of this artist on the Tuck and Patti albums. I was very impressed. However Tuck by himself is missing some of the soulfulness that he has when he plays with her. Technically he is very good but he seems to try to do too much on some songs. Sometimes less is more. Some of the material on this CD is very good (Somewhere Over The Rainbow, Body and Soul) but sometimes it sounds like lots of notes for the sake of more notes. The lack of continuity makes it difficult for me to put it on and play it without skipping a few tracks. I guess the title is appropriate. So if that is what you are looking for...."
5,An incredible guitar virtuoso!,"It doesn't matter if you play guitar or just appreciate good guitar music, this CD is essential. Tuck, the one-man-band-Andress plays jazz standards, funk and popular music without missing a beat. His ability to play rhythm, bass lines and the melody AT THE SAME TIME is simply unreal; and although each song is technically amazing, he never loses touch with what is most important to the song - it's individuality."
3,"Great player, perhaps not his best wrok though","Tuck is a wonderful player and this 'solo album' has his 'man in the mirror' and 'somehwere over the rainbow' but I personally felt the rest to lack lustre compared to his work with tuck and patti which generally has a solo track and great guitar playeing along with the songs which is stellar. Probably a reson that it is out of print! Still, it's worth a listen to for those that like to be complete or a real fan of Tucks work..."
4,Communist Critique,"The book itself has an ugly design and is made with poor material, but the actual text is worth reading, especially if you have only heard the official history of the United States. The essays in the book offer a communist perspective of American history, emphasizing the social and structural processes underpinning historical change. But there are moments that the writers come off, to me, as sort of the stereotypical 'crotchety' communist whose resentment tinges their critique with an embittered, vengeful air, namely against the bourgeoisie who are seen as the diabolical cabalists responsible for the suppression of liberatory social movements throughout history. But it just rubbed me that way a few times, otherwise this book has good examinations of American society and its emergence as a capitalist superpower."
4,"Good stuff, slight design flaw","I've had these for over a year now. They have been sturdy and have endured a year's worth of drops without cracking. I wash them in the dishwasher and have had a couple of them get white stains (I'm assuming it's from etching in the dw). No matter though. What I do think could be better is that if you have the handles lined up so they can all hang from something, they don't nest properly. The little red holder that they came with got chunked as it was completely useless to me. I got a red plastic circular thing and attached them to it then hung it from a peg. They don't nest right but that's how it all works best for me. Be nice if they all nested properly when the handles were hung in a row. I would buy them again."
5,Sea Gull Lighting 8504-12,"Excellent lights. They were very easy to install, look nice, and are working perfectly. I believe they will hold up well, too."
5,Very Happy Together,"I bought this on cassette when it first came out. After buy the same cassette twice more (I played them until the tape wore out on each one!) I finally bought it on CD. Infact I bought 2 CD's of this incase you can wear one out. We saw them in concert. This played at our wedding, and it played at my husbands funeral as well. I still love the clear crisp tones of there voices as they blend into a beautiful harmony."
3,I have a question!!,"The song touch of your hand is also performed by a girl, its the EXACT same song. Does anyone know who it is by?? PLEASE HELP I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT!!"
3,"It Rocks,however...","A tribute to Sun Records and not a cut from the Killer?? Jerry Lee Lewis lives right down the road from Sun Studio,so why was he excluded from a ""tribute"" to his old stable? For all who may not know,he still ROCKS,and does so with alot of gusto!! I did enjoy the Dylan cut,as well as McCartney,ChrissieHynde,Van and Carl,Kid Rock,Cheryl,and the rest,many of these tunes have been covered before,and were hits, many by the guy who was snubbed,Mr. Lewis! So what gives?? If the listener isn""t aware of Sam Phillips,the big ""E"",Carl,Killer,Cash,Warren Smith,Howlin Wolk ,Rufus Thomas and all the rest,then this will help open a door to some reat roots music for them,I found it refreshing overall."
5,WOW...,"A truly great CD, well worth purchasing. Matchbox Twentys Cover of Lonely Weekend is just FABULOUS!! Really highlights Robs amazing voice and the talent of the band. Cant wait to see them perform it live later this month on PBS. The entire CD I thought was really great."
4,"some cool stuff here, some not so cool stuff too","what you see is what you're gonna get....the older artists on this cd (van morrison, mccartney, dylan, page, beck, clapton) stay truer to the sun sound than the newer artists (kid rock, matchbox 20, live). i personally like the truer-sounding artists better--i don't care about these newer bands' interpretations of classic tunes. but to each his or her own. it's cool to hear mccartney sing ""that's all right"" and clapton stands out with ""walking in the rain."" the dylan tune is wonderful, as is the hynde/jeff beck collaboration. if nothing else, if you don't own any of the original sun recordings, go get some!!"
4,Rock & Roll,"Good album of 50's style music.Lots of pleasing reproductions but a few real clunkers.The worst tracks are by Matchbox 20,Live,and Howling Diablos.By far,the best track and singer is You Win Again by Mandy Barnett.Paul McCartney,Chris Isaak,Jeff Beck,and Jimmy Page are a notch below.This album has mostly achieved its mission,a return to the 50's sound of the glory days of Rock & Roll.Worth buying!"
1,Not accurate,My kitchen-Aid oven and this thermometer differ by 50 degrees at 400. I have another oven thermometer which is much closer to the temperature of my oven. I've been cooking long enough to know the thermometer is wrong by a lot.
4,Good and mostly accurate,"If your oven is older it may not be maintaining a constant temp. Mine was this way and I looked at a variety of gadgets to measure the temp. I finally settled on this kitchen aid thermometer. For the first few months it was spot on in telling e temperature but after about a years use I measured the oven using a thermal meter and my thermometer was about 7 degrees off, still closer then my stove said it was. Overall I'm happy with this and would buy it again."
4,Good Thermometer,"Workd very well. Used it to confirm my oven temp .v. the readout on the oven. Taught me that while the oven is dead-on when set at 350, the oven indicator says it is up to temp about 5 minutes before the thermometer agreed. Need to ignore the ready prompt, and wait about 4-5 minutes before baking!"
1,Cracked/Stained,"It stained within 6-10 weeks of uses. It's been about three years and now has a crack in the glass. Would not buy or recommend it . Also, it was NOT DROPPED as some may think !! The highest temp was 475 not any higher !!!"
2,It melts in your hand,"William Ackerman's first three albums (I can't speak for any others) are so bland, so mild, so inoffensive that you could play them to your aged grandmother without any problems, except that she might ask you to turn them up; on a couple of the faster items you might notice her tapping her toe, faintly. But I'll bet that after listening some time your grandmother's going say, ""Well, it's very pretty and all, but aincha got Blind Joe Death by John Fahey? When I hear the American acoustical guitar, I like it to go someplace, not just lie in a corner and curl up!"" Ackerman's tunes drift pleasantly down, like snow, and melt as soon as they touch the ground, leaving not a trace behind, except the faint impression of wasted time."
1,Not for Type 1,"I purchased this book for my wife who is Type 1 and wants to count carbs. This book is for those who are Type 2 and states several pages into the book that it is not for Type 1. No where in the advertised description of the book is that very necessary information given. I will be returing the book, how disappointing."
5,Very good book,This book goes to the heart of diabetes carbohydrates and their metabolisim and why you have to count carbs. This book helps to explain diabetic equivalents and their relationship to carbs. It also has very good recipies.
3,white's write-up's,"if you love Napalm Death then this is a must have! The sound quality is much better than the ""Bootleg"" recordings, but still leaves a little to be desired. A first time N.D. listener would be lost in the brutal time changes and aggressive transition. Nontheless, it does capture the raw power of the kings of grind-core.I would recommend buying the c.d.\d.v.d. combo. If you've never seen them live, the d.v.d. is a close second to the real thing."
2,Not what I expected,"If you are looking for a book of suggested phrases for Birthday, Thank You and Sympathy cards this is NOT it. This book doesn't include those chapters at all. Also, the ""bargain"" book was marked with a slash from a black marker on the edge of the pages. I bought 4 of these and they were all marked ... another disappointment as I was planning to give them as hostess gifts."
2,Still good but.....,"I loved the whole series, but I really have to take issue with the last couple of episodes. Who the heck were the Nuclear bomb people? Now I know that Japan has war issues, but where did those people come from? They weren't mentioned at all in the series until the last 6 episodes, but suddenly they appear, have uber weaponry and then try to take over. And I hate that.. it's a plot device for someone to say ""War is Bad!!""... like we don't know that. There was no other reason for that to happen, save for the 'message' that the creators were trying to convey.If these guys were mentioned earlier in the series, then fine I would agree with the inclusion at the end, but it seemed to me they were created just to bang us over the head with the 'message'.A typically bad japanese ending to a great show (would it kill them to have some semblence of a happy ending, I guess I should be grateful that the main cast survived)"
3,Final Episode Disappointing,I loved this series up until the final episode. It seemed contrived and rushed. I don't want to ruin it for anybody reading this who hasn't seen it but things didn't turn out the way they should have. It was such a disappointment to me that I wish I had never seen it and I could continue imagining the happy ending that I had expected.
5,HITOMI NOOOOOOOOO,"Sorry, this IS the BEST series ever, it has romance, action at every turn and mystery not to mention suspense.I can't believe Hitomi does that, grrr, I won't say what but this is a MUSt buy, however I feel i should warn sensitive ears it does say damn a lot and bast........ once. I hated that part, that was the only bad thing to me. I can't believe she doesn't kiss him, ahhhh! The motion pictures are great, showing great detail and improving with every scene! The continual twists and plots. very complex for an anime. GREAt GREAt gREat!!! I will always be a escaflowne fan! VAN forever! LoL!^.*"
5,The best anime series ever?,"Escaflowne has the potential. It contains the greatest elements of fantasy, scifi, and romance. I recommand this series to anyone who enjoys good anime!"
2,Desperation option,"It's hard to find a good quality A/B/C switch to use with your TV - and this isn't it. It has noticeable feedthrough from the unswitched inputs, and as a result your picture quality appears degraded. As a minor irritation, the plastic housing is cheap, the buttons are numbered C-B-A rather than A-B-C, and the switch ""feel"" differs between the buttons - that is, when A or C is selected, its button stays pushed in; but when B is selected, all buttons are out. If you are desperate for a three-way switch - maybe OK. At least, this one is cheap. But if you can find a good quality switch, you would be happier with it. ADDITIONAL INFO: I gave up on this switch and replaced it with two Radio shack #15-1217 A/B Switches, hooked in tandem. This allows A-B-C switching without the crosstalk problems."
3,"Beautiful Kenya, lousy mystery","The way, the author describes Kenya is wonderful. I've been there before and this book is like a safari to memory lane. Whether it is the beautiful Kenya of tourists and safaris and wildlife or the shocking Kenya of Nairobi slums, whether it is the culture of Kikuyu or the life of whites in this African country, it is all painted in vivid colors! I really loved that part. But the mystery part was sucks, pardon my language. I have already read ""Deadly Safari"" and it sounds so dumb, that the same lady should come across three murders in less than one year. And of course she solves them heroically. More or less without anybody's help. That's great, it's just a little too way off for my taste. If I may suggest something to the author: keep writing about Kenya, but try something different from mystery. Or at least let go of Jazz Jasper!"
4,I dig the Elephant's Graveyard,"As with her first Jazz Jasper novel, Deadly Safari, Karin McQuillan's Elephant's Graveyard provides adventure, mystery and entertainment. That's a good start. On top of that, McQuillan's action scenes are among the most exciting and gritty ever written for a woman protagonist. Set in the beauty of the African Jungle, Elephant's Graveyard explores all kinds of relationships between people, animals, the environment, and ultimately, between good and evil. It's a great read that comes complete with a set of moral standards firmly in place. Write on, Karin McQuillan. Jazz is a winner."
4,A read to inspire,"Good book if you're in a slump. If you are already a highly motivated girl, you're bound to get reinvigorated and take action!"
3,Jack in the post 70s...,"For 1980's ""I've Always Wanted To Do This,"" Jack Bruce took a step out of the 'self-indulgent-ME' 70s and leapt out into the world of click tracks, digital reverb and tight studio (albeit bare) production. The album has a feel which can only be found on releases from 1980-1982, but that's okay. Frankly, this IS NOT one of my favorites (thought Hit and Run is quite catchy); and if you're not keen on that particularly thin, dry, 80s Studio-Sound, you probably won't like this...However, it truly is a period piece, and though it may not shine like 1971's Harmony Row or 1977's How's Tricks, it is certainly akin to Picasso's 'blue' period pieces; a slight departure, but nonetheless brilliant..."
3,Stamina Extended Stride Elliptical / Stepper,"We were interested in this item because of the 'extended' stride feature. However, due to the unclear written instructions, the product was difficult to assemble, and its usability was not very functional.In terms of value over cost effectiveness, the list price is not suitable for this machine. The Stamina is uncomfortable to achieve good cardiovascular exercise because the stride is not smooth, and the body is unsturdy. We think this is due to the quality of its parts or craftsmanship. For a small price difference, we found theSchwinn 430 Elliptical Trainerto be much better."
1,Stamina Elliptical Stride Review,"Do not buy this product!!!!! I wish I could return it. The design is poor and you hit your knees on the handles as you exercise. You could injure yourself in a simple first attempt on this machine. Also, it does not have enough length and you have to stand with half your foot off the strider as you use the equipment, making the total experience more stressful on your legs and feet. I would not recommend this equipment for anyone.Don't be fooled like me. This is my worst internet purchase.And obviously my trust in Amazon is very diminished...I expected that Amazon personnel would have at least evaluated the products that are sold in some way before allowing it to be sold. This product should be removed from your website. Not worth the money."
2,POLISH?,"You call that a polish? I was expecting that this wrench would have better polish for the price. In the end though, it is a very nice wrench. It just doesn't fit the price."
4,Not as compact as I was hoping for but...,"Not much to this really. Best solution for adapting a IEEE1284 Centronics cable to db25. I needed a USB to db25 parallel adapter and could find no such creature. I had a USB to IEEE1284, and this corrected the pinout format."
5,inuyashafanfuckya,"this is a great dvd i love it like all of them.It has episodes83.GIRL YOROJOK AND THE GREAT PROMIS84. SUPER SPEED MARRIAGE DEAL85. EVIL SPIRITS RISING,DEMON'S SERVERD HEADI LOVE THESE INUYASHA EPISODES THERE ALL GREAT TRY THIS DVD ITS GREAT."
5,The Definitive Source,"A great reference book, the Palm OS Bible covers areas such specialized topics as conduits, IrDA, and color. It's not for a beginner (I recommend Programming the Palm OS - From the Ground Up) since it isn't really in tutorial or walk-through format, but it is definitely a book that every Palm OS developer should have on the shelf."
5,Great Reference,"This book is one of the best palm references around. In addition to being packed with information, its realitivly easy to read, and after you have read it its easy to use as a reference. While there is not detailed information about each and every data type (struct) this information is readily avaliable in the SDK so its not really necessary to reproduce in the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Palm OS programming."
2,Fairly weak compared to books on other platforms...,"While this book may be good compared to the general run of palm programming books, its rather bad compared to the references available for other platforms/languages. The code samples and functions are poorly explained, the book does not appear to have been updated for release 6 of CodeWarrior and certain cross-references in the text do not exist (e.g. animation). My primary complaint is that the text really fails to be either a good general reference (which is what I bought it for) or to be a good guide to palm programming (which is what a failed reference book ought to at least be able to do). I've been a C/C++ programmer for over 10 years and really think this book fails to meet the standard set by other references (e.g. Jeff Prosise's Programming Windows with MFC, Second Edition)."
1,Poor approach towards problems,I have been using this book for last one month. I am trying to develop applications using tables and other UI but this book concentrates so much on GCC version its pathetic. We use CodeWarrior as a development tool and this is the most pathetic version of book i ever bought. It would be nice if they had included how to kind of tips instead of aimlessly exploring unecessarily into other examples. I learnt more about plam from web search then this book
4,Poetry gets better & better,"When I first started out, some of the poems felt a little juvenille. However, a few pages into the work, the poems started getting better & better!The poems deal with mostly with love- falling in love, falling out of love, finding your soulmate, love between friends, etc. The feelings can be rather intense in some of the pieces, most likely because they deal with the raw emotions we've all felt and sometimes been burnt by.A great book whether you're a poetry buff, you've just found ""the one"" or your need a little help recovering from a past love. There's something that everyone can relate to in this book!"
4,Great For My First,"This book can be easily summed up by looking at the author's introduction. The entries in this book are extremely heartfelt and emotional. The angst of teen love is apparent, taking all of us who are not teens, back to that time of vulnerability and bringing us into adulthood and into maturity. I will be honest and say that this isnt my best work, but it is damn good! How can I say this? I AM the author of this book.Please visit my site: http://www.losdaddyenterprises.com to buy this book at the cheapest price! As always, come back to Amazon.com and rate me, I need the exposure, thanks for looking, listening, and loving....."
2,NOT THE BEST OF KEANU,"SPOTTY DETAILS, SOME INFORMATION ON FAMILY HISTORY INCORRECT, ROBERT MILLER KATINA MILLERS'S FATHER NOT SAM REEVES, NOT THE BEST READING I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO ABOUT KEANU AND I'VE READ A LOT."
3,a little Keanu is better than no Keanu,"This is mostly about the early career of this terrific actor, and it's fairly well written and researched (though there are some errors) , with a total of 12 photos of him from his films...this small volume isn't exactly Dostoevsky, but it contains over 40 pages of Keanu, so how can you not love it ! York Membery closes the book by saying ""of course, nothing is certain in the fickle world of the movies. But whatever happens, it seems likely that Keanu Reeves will be around for a long time"". A very long time...he's the stuff legends are made of !"
1,BAD IDEA!,"This is the worst purchase I made all year. After finally completing the bug filled installation, you will surely be disappointed with: poor customer service, poor picture quality, channels you should have not coming in at all, a partially working remote control, a vanishing mouse pointer, countless reboots due to FlyVideo crashing your operating system(I have Windows 98), and a screen that will turn to black and when you try to close the program - everything will close except the sound - which you will be unable to get rid of without restarting windows. To secure a miserable tv card experience, FlyVideo '98 is the way to go!"
4,"BUY IT- Unlike some others, I like this card","I bought this card a week ago and I am very pleased with it. Comparing it to some other tv cards that my friends have, this card by far has better picture quality and the remote control is a plus. I love the mouse motion function on the remote. I can open and close programs while I am watching tv. Installion was easy too. The only negative is the radio program that comes with it. It is very poor."
5,The Best PPG Book I've Seen,"This is by far the best book I have seen on powered paragliding. It's well-written, well-organized, thorough, and has beautiful 4-color pictures all through the book. It is basically a training manual that takes the reader through PPG training from start to finish, and includes lots of valuable information about techniques, equipment, aerodynamics, safety, and a host of other topics. It's published in Britain, so it has a British ""flavour"", but this only serves to add charm to the text. Whether you're a grizzly old veteran PPG pilot, or a rank novice, you'll love reading this book. I did."
4,A Good Movie version of the opera,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to see a Chinese Opera. While disappointed that it was a movie adaptation of the opera, as such the movie is very well done with good singing, acting and engaging plot."
3,Nice thermometer - maybe too long for you.,"this thermometer looks very professional, and it's face is very readable and helpful, and it cleans off very easily. However, the probe is quite long, and it will not register an accurate temperature unless you sink the entire probe into your meat. This is very hard to do with smaller cuts, due to the size of this beast. I overcooked a small pork roast AND a roasting chicken before realizing the problem."
3,It's Huge!,"I just received this thermometer, and felt I just had to write a review. It's Huge! I mean really Huge! I think it may topple over in a smaller cut of meat. On the plus side, it does seem to be very well made and sturdy, something I never thought I would say about a meat thermometer. My husband likes it."
1,Complete Junk,"First of all let me say that I own a Kitchen-Aid blender, two mixers, food processor, stove, microwave, dishwasher and refrigerator -- so I obviously like the brand. This thermometer is cheaply made and the thin glass broke after two uses (not from dropping). The needle jiggles when you insert it. Oh yeah it has a ""No hassle warranty"". Good luck finding out how to submit a claim on their website -- not that I want a replacement anyway. My supermarket thermometer at 1/3 the cost is far superior in every way."
2,Fossil is not the answer if you want reliability,"It might just be REALLY bad luck, but after three fossil watches (1 x blue, 2 x titanium), I've never managed to make them last more than two years each. They are really cool, look great and the price is reasonable. But this is the third time Fossil lets me down. And to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful.This time I'm looking for another brand as I feel I'm wasting my money."
5,I have been searching for this book for years,"My favorite book as a child is finally back in print! I have been searching bookstores and libraries after my original copy was lost when I lent it to a niece. I must have read Magic Elizabeth ten times as a child, and still, 35 years or so later, still think about it occasionally. Magic Elizabeth took me on a trip that no other book from my childhood had."
3,Doesn't hold up well,"We got this for a wedding present the end of April last year. We've used it probably a 15 times or so over the course of the year and now it has stopped working. The canister spins fine, and you pour the mixture in and then within 5 minutes it gets bogged down and stops and all you have is a colder ice cream mixture that you cannot do anything with."
2,Deni ice cream maker,Returned it because it smelled as though it was burning up even though I followed instructions and never made anything but soft serve things. But I sure liked their recipes and there was very little trouble returning it. Got a Cuizart.
5,Raiders from the Sea,"These are an EXCELLENT series of books.Very well writen with high adventure,and cliff hangers. You really felt as ifyou know the characters. This is a wonderfulhistorical fiction. I really learned alot aboutthe Vikings."
5,a kid's review,"A great series!!! I love it! It is very interesting and exciting,but not scary. I would definitly recommend this book."
3,Series Probably Won't Appeal to Non-Christians,"I knew that this book came from a Christian publisher, but was hoping that the faith of the characters would be an organic part of the narrative, rather than being inserted forcefully into the story. I was disappointed in that respect; sometimes the author laid it on a bit thick, especially with the ""miracle"" at the end of the book. I thought that it was the Christian belief that we love God just because God IS, and not for what God can do for us in the way of supernatural pyrotechnics. Does this give the young reader an accurate idea of what faith is? If we are in trouble and call on God for a miracle and it doesn't happen, what happens to our faith then?I also didn't like the disrespectful way that the religious beliefs of the Vikings were treated. To boil religious diversity down to ""My God is stronger than your God"" is not a particularly helpful message to be putting out into a world that is still filled with religious conflict."
4,Great Phone For The Price.,"This phone has many excellent features! On the up side, the ringer melodies are a nice change from the typical annoying ringers of most newer phones. The handset is very small and light, which could be a good AND a bad thing. The flashing antenna feature is great so you don't disturb late sleepers. Speakerphone on the handset is very convenient. On the down side, the Voice Enhancer feature is horrible. When I enable this feature, I have difficulty hearing the person on the other end. And I wish it had an input for a headset. All in all, this phone is worth every penny! Because it only costs a few pennies!"
2,OK but not great,Not exactly what I had hoped for when it came. I even thought about returning it but I did the math and I figured out it would not have been worth it. Not as compact and user friendly as it appears.
3,Okay Cookbook,"I love Sunset cookbooks, but this is an old one. Copyrite 1981.My husband and I decided we wanted to gradually start eating more vegetarian meals to get healthier. I bought this cookbook, but there are so many more interesting ones available now that being vegetarian isn't as weird as it used to be.The Vegetarian Bible, of course, is Deborah Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone."" I have made many delicious company and family meals with her recipes. This is a tome, with useful information about everything vegetarian.If you're looking for a great vegetarian cookbook, I'd skip Sunset's Vegetarian Cooking. I do, however, love Sunset's ""Complete Vegetarian Cookbook."" Copyrite 1993. Beautiful photos and large-type recipes. Lots of wonderful recipes. The mega-muffins are absolutely fabulous. I've made them all. We like the Carrot-Nut Mighty Muffins the best."
4,"Life in Ethiopia, Africa in the 70s","VOLUNTEERING IN ETHIOPIA provides valuable insights into understanding and appreciating the African people of this country.This book focuses on the Peace Corps experiences of Group XIV in Ethiopia in the early 1970s.The author, who is now an international lawyer, vividly describes their volunteer experiences in this African country, which range from the challenges of dealing with cultural shock and personal rejection to the joys of finding meaningful and fulfilling contributions.The book truly tells about life in this country at this time with honesty and integrity."
4,Championship Techniques Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,"I think ""Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Championship Techniques"" is a good reference book for anyone practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, that wants techniques that can improve their game. I like the layout of the book, it's easy to read and the photos are clear. This is a good book for any Martial Artist to have in their collection."
5,Order it now. (trust me you won't be disappointed),This is a great book. Jean Jacque Machado has produced another winner.
1,Horrible! Don't buy!,"Some people may think 'Ahh... This is a 12 year old kid!Whatdoes he know? He's probably out to write a bad review!'. Well, that happens not to be true. I bought this thinking I could use this for my songs on my Cassiopeia E-115. I got it, added songs to it. But within the week something happend to the card. I had taken it out one night to put in my 56K Modem for AOL use. When I put it in, in the morning, all the songs where gone and it wasn't able to find the songs are add any more to it..."
1,MB NOT GB,"Just so anyone looking at this sees that it is MB, not GB!!! That is megabytes not gigabytes. This thing is tiny and not particularly useful today."
1,Memory Card,"I'm returning the card, because it didn't work. This is the first item that I have returned, because it did not work."
2,Not happy,"First of all the item was what I ordered. I used it in a stelth camera outdoors. It worked fine the first time I inserted it in the camera. Then I tried to put it in the reader and it wouldnt go in. Apon examination I found a bent pin in the card, which bent a pin in my reader causing it to be no good. I fixed the pin in the card and bought a new reader, and all is well now."
5,Memory Cards for All Uses,"The most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera, but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices, including the HP Jordana, and even your laptop computer with a PC Card adapter. You can store any type of data on the cartridge, and they can be quickly changed between devices. I have never had a problem with any of my SanDisk Compact Flash Cards."
4,Good Product but . . .,"I have a few friends that have purchased this product and it works fine. If however the price is too high or it is out of stock I would recommend the Viking CF32M (it is currently a little less expensive).If you look at all of the reviews of both products you will see that they are very comparable in regards to quality and reliability (in fact there is one review that states the Viking card is actually faster).Anyway, this is a good product when the price is right and it is in stock."
4,It gets the job done,"...And it does it well. For the price, the 32mb is the best value. Unless you plan on taking hundreds of High Res, Large format pictures, don't waste money on a larger card. I use this card with a Canon S100 and I'm very happy with the results. I've never had to worry about running out of space when shooting low res(640x480) almost 300 pics, and in Hi Res Mode (overkill) it can still handle more than 30. I've taken and deleted hundreds of pictures with no problems."
3,Hard cover,I just want to said yes is the same book one is in hard cover and the other is in paper back they always has diferent cover
5,Can be read more than once,"I love the fact there is the translation without commentary in the whole, and the fact that a lot of effort was made to bring the translation into English as precise as possible.The essays are a plus and additional insight, but the raw translation is something you can return to over and over again."
4,Classic example of a business-crossover book,"One of the oldest examples of a book written about topic ""x"" that translates well into the business environment. A quick read that gives the reader a confidence boost as well as some great negotiating strategies.Michael T. Hanley, CPA is the Managing Partner of the Smithtown, NY CPA Firm, Merl & Hanley, LLP and the author of Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness: 30 Minutes With...A Certified Public Accountant: Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness"
2,good but hard,I like most of it but at times it was hard to fully understand. I am going to read it again and I hope to better gain more of it the second tie around.
1,Manufacturing defects made pole hard to assemble.,"Pole arrived on time and was as described. The sections of the pole must be assembled by inserting one section into another. Unfortunately, burrs and sizing problems made it very difficult to assemble. It was finally assembled with the use of a grinder, mallet, and hack saw. If it had been easier to assemble, it would have been rated at 3 or 4 stars.Update January 2011. This pole has been up for a few months, but was destroyed during the first significant winter storm, a blizzard with about 20 to 30 mph winds. The wind bent it so far over that the pole buckled about 8 inches above ground level. (I had taken the flag down before the storm struck to reduce wind resistance.) I have neighbors who've had flag poles up for over 20 years without any problems. This pole was difficult to assemble because of poor quality control and the metal is too weak to withstand normal New England winter storm conditions."
3,Nice looking,This is a nice Flag pole if you don't live in a very windy area. We tend to get a lot of high winds which make the pole flex. I don't trust it on a windy day not to bend I remove the flag.
4,Good but stack on so good.,They are very easy to use but they do not stack well. But if you remove the scraper the stack just fine.
4,All about security,"This knife...... has a clip so strong it won't let go of your pocket unless you MAKE it. Heck, you will barely be able to get it clipped to your pocket in the first place!... has a liner lock that will not release unless you MAKE it. And you'll feel when you're releasing it.... has a super coarse grip that will not slip out of your hand unless you MAKE it. Who needs a pumice stone when you have this?"
4,a must for early jazz rock fans of breckers and billy cobham,"this mostly live studio album was done in the early 70's. DREAMS is an inovative album by the young BRECKER BROS.(michael barely 19, randy formerly of B,S&T). It has great horn licks and catchy songs. The second side is an unbelievable, energetic drum solo by the classic BILLY COBHAM and wild, frantic sax solo by MICHAEL. This is a must have album for early horn band afficianados!!"
4,Eclectic music for dreamers,"Haunting and beautiful. Its a shame that the only people who will find this gem are those who already knew it existed. Preview ""The Maryanne"" and ""Holli Be Home"", they're my favorites on this disc."
2,Not Yet Their Time,"I bought this album on LP when it hit the budgie bins in the early 70s, and the CD a few weeks ago.The recording had so much promise: Randy and Mike Brecker, Billy Cobham, John Abercrombie.Ultimately, this album was a disappointment to me. While the arrangements are interesting in spots, there are too many diffused attempts to hit pop charts with vocal pieces and insufficient solo space for either Brecker (although Mike had a couple of nice solos on the last 2 cuts). I agree that Columbia might have been trying to nudge them toward a BS&T; thing, since BS&T; was selling lots of records at the time.The talent clearly compares to the fusion bands that were around then and soon thereafter, but saddling the talent with boring vocal pieces with boring vocalists and lyrics squanders it.This album might be interesting to collectors to hear what these players sounded like before they became well-known, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."
4,M-Flyer 512MB USB Flash Drive,"I am enjoying the ease of use with the ""no-cap"" design. The drive is a bit long and comes with a small belt case that is pretty useless. The laniard is not an around-the-neck style. It is short and for around the wrist only. This also is a negative. The drive, however, is a good overall design and with a little help from another USB drive's laniard, I now have the around-the-neck style that I like. The included software is good but I do not use it. The drive seems to be a solid design for doing the simple task of holding my digital ""stuff""."
4,nice flash drive,this is a nice 512 MB flash drive. It works fast and efficiently. I like the new design which makes it capless. This also adds to the problem of it becoming dusty!I genrally carry it in my bag and the cover that goes with it usually falls off and is lost in caverns of my bag.other than that this is a great flash drive which has a lot of show off value because my friends love it! It looks unusual and very hi tech gadget like!
3,Shoulda played at the movie theatre,"Two words: David Boreanaz. If you are a Buffy/Angel fan, then you will enjoy the few minutes David is actually in the movie. David sports a healthy Florida tan and avoids the dark colors he is known for on his TV show. Oh, this is supposed to be about the movie, right? Seriously, the movie is worth adding to your DVD collection. Monica Potter is believable as a norotic New Yorker having man problems. Henry Thomas has grown up to be a nice-looking and even more talented actor since ""E.T."". The other three male characters add some humorous entertainment to the movie. Go on! Buy it! Worse could happen is you sell it at a garage sale. I think you will be happily surprised with this find."
3,"Good, but not great (but Gael Garcia Bernal is in it!)","i must admit I only hired this movie because my fav actor Gael Garcia Bernal is in it. I honestly wasn't expecting the movie to be much. But it's quite good! Not great, but an enjoyable movie to watch on a date or on a lazy sunday afternoon."
4,Cute...,This was a cute romantic comedy and I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. It was a light movie and pretty well-done. It isn't the best movie ever but I still would recommend it...
1,gael gael gael,"To be honest with you I wanted to see this movie cause Gael Garcia is in it. He definetly was, but not enough. Big disappointment."
3,she picked the wrong guy,"This movie would have been a lot better if Lucy had picked a different guy. She managed to end up with the least attractive, second-most annoying one of her dates, and they had absolutely no chemistry. In a romance movie, the viewer likes to identify with the characters, and I think this movie didn't do well because no one wanted to end be in Lucy's shoes at the end. Like some of the other reviewers, I initially decided to watch this movie for a chance to see Gael Garcia Bernal, but it was Anthony LaPaglia's performance and character that charmed me. What started off as an abysmal date actually turned out pretty well, and Bobby and Lucy had some of the funniest exchanges of the movie, and they had good chemistry. I wanted to see more of them together."
2,The best 5 minutes,Watch out for Gael Garcia..he is an amazing talented actor and heavenly good looking. His cameo is probably the best 5 minutes of this film. Just wait a couple years..Gael will be a super star!!!
4,a romantic guilty pleasure,"So it's not the best movie in the world. So it's not a blockbuster film that was in the theaters forever. Was it even in the theaters? All I know is I love to watch this movie when I'm in the mood to smile, and fall in love with Henry Thomas. How cute is he in this film? I think it's an adorable and pretty honest look at the dating world in New York City. My roommates and I rented it once, and kept renting, so I eventually just bought it. If you're sick of the usual Julia Roberts romantic comedies, try this one for a change of pace. You might rewind certain parts to see Henry's cute smile too!"
3,I'm With Lucy,I thought this was a really sweet chick flick. Great for a rainy afternoon with no men around. It shows just how hard it is to get back in the dating pool after a bad breakup. It also proves that first impressions aren't always right. Give a guy a chance and he just might be the right one if not the perfect one.
5,Well scripted,This video and story line was well scripted with the woman in mind in her search for happiness.Sweetness combined with men who were not caring. The film ends with the viewer in a happymood.
4,"Finally, a Unique Romantic Comedy","In I'm With Lucy, you learn from the get-go that Lucy is going to marry one of the five guys that she has a blind date with. And as the movie progresses, you get to have fun trying to guess who it is because they are all hillariously bad.You'll quickly know all of the main characters (Lucy, 5 guys and a few of Lucy's friends) because the movie somehow gives them so much life. You'll love or hate them all by the end while having a hundred good laughs in between.If you're up for a rom com soon, you'd do yourself a huge disservice by not watching this one."
3,Fari Keyboard Stickers,"These stickers would be a great deal more useful if accompanied by a written insert with instructions for using them -- such as suggestions for selection of the correct keyboard options for MAC's and PC's. Presumably, a correct setup of Options/Preferences would make possible straightforward typing in Farsi."
4,"One of the best cross-Tejano-Country CD's,Makes you dance","I got this cd from a friend,she told me it was good and had to listen. Boy was I suprised,it is great.The cumbias and rancheras make you want to dance.The country song, Ladies & Love songs is beautifull, and The Hot Tamale Man is going to be a classic. I'm telling all my friends to get it. Good job Gabe!!!!!"
3,Some things to watch out for,"This is a nice way to watch TV on your notebook computer, but there are several precautions that one should be aware of. These precautions can be an awful hassel.It is strongly recommended that you download the latest version of the TV tuner's driver program from Lifeview's website. Don't use the driver program from the installation CD-ROM because the driver program from the CD-ROM is very buggy.Also, the notebook computer's USB port does not provide enough power to operate the TV Tuner. More power must be drawn from the external keyboard port using a special cable provided by the product.Finally, if one wants to hook-up a VCR or a device like the Playstation to the TV-tuner, one has to connect the VCR's or playstation's audio out to external speakers or to the audio-in of the computer's sound card. (Not all notebook computers have an audio-in connection)."
1,piece of junk,I have one of these lifeview tuners. I bought it because I travel quite extensively and wanted to watch TV occasionally while I worked. I have never been able to tune in to any television station with it. Even in areas with excellent television broadcast power. the picture is always full of static and the device is basicly useless.
1,not happy with my fan,I bought this fan as everybody else did thinking this would be a nice fan that would last me for a long time I bought it last year and it didnt ever last me two seasons. I turn it on and it runs fine for a while then it gets hot and shuts down. So needless to say it is no god to me now I dont dare leave it on all night for fear it will short out or something like that. I only use it in my bed room at night and that is it so it is not used 24 7 so it has not been beat on. I bought a new one of a diffrent brand and have not had a problem with it . I know two diffrent people who bought the same kind of fan and theirs did the same thing. In my opinion it was not a good value for the money I paid for it it really dissapointed me.
5,Awesome air flow for the money!,"Just got this fan today. It comes all in one piece so you don't have to put anything together. I plugged it in and set it on low and was immediately impressed with it's power. Medium and high really get things moving although it does sound like a prop on an airplane as previously stated. That's fine with me since I will be using it in the hallway rather than a bedroon or something. It looks solid and is bigger than I thought it would be. This fan puts my 20"" box fan to shame and will probably last much longer. Buy this fan! You won't regret it."
5,Patton Fans,I have had and been around many fans in the last 30 years.Patton has the best fans on the market by far.
4,Great air movement. Loud and vibrates the floor,"We bought this fan for an upstairs game room turned exercise room. It works wonders. This room gets very hot. There's no wall that seperates it from the downstairs, so it gets all of the heat from our fire place. We've pointed the fan towards the treadmill and it is great at keeping us cool and moving the air. It is loud and vibrates the floor quite a bit, as would be expected, but it's great while excerising or doing some other loud activity."
2,love patton however,I love patton fans however this one happened to not work correctly I will purchase another and hope I will not be disappointed
2,Poorly Executed Text; Good Collection of Color Plates,"An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price. The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as ""horror,"" ""grotesque,"" ""misshapen,"" and ""ugly,"" at one point writing, ""Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything."""
4,Good Pictures,Good book for the price. A little over the top in terms of praising Picasso. Good quality images.
2,Not a Keeper,Bought this pump back in Oct 08' at Lowes. Had to return it the same day because it malfunctioned. Exchanged it for another one. That pump pooped out by Sept 10'. Don't buy this substandard product. Call a specialty plumbing store and buy it through them. Who wants to work on the well that often?
5,Great little time capsule,"Good video quality. (I suspect it is on par with the original broadcast :) Low volume hum; but not bad.This late 1960's interview with a pop start has more depth than some of today's presidential interviews.Pierre asked Bruce Lee if Nixon's trip to China might lead to more opportunities for Chinese actors.Compare that to a question recently put to President and Mrs Obama, ""Which of you is funnier?"""
4,satisfied customer,"My little girl loves Brum, and this DVD was no exception. The actual disc is in great condition and the delivery was prompt."
2,kitchenaid stainless steel serving tongs,"While this product arrived promptly, I was disappointed in it because I was hoping for something much smaller. I did not find a measurement with the description before I ordered it. That would have been helpful."
4,Another winner,"Gavin Watt knows this Revolutionary war theatre better than any other historian, and his work here is excellent. He manages to tell a compelling story while constantly shifting focus from raids against inhabitants of the Mohawk Valley to individuals in England and Fort Niagara plotting larger strategies. The details he offers his readers of individual attacks upon settlements large and small are constant reminders of the brutality of the ongoing campaign in the Mohawk Valley, and the suffering that occurred for all involved. Besides being a significant contribution to the military literature of the American Revolution, Watt's work is a fine addition to local history in New York. This is a book students of the American Revolution in general and the Mohawk Valley in particular will want on their bookshelf."
5,Spectacular,"Leave it to Gavin Watt to get the point accross with dash. THe book is very well researched and the research shows in the writing.We are introduced to many people in such a way that you feel you can shake their hand. The events mentioned are told with such passion that you can feel the action taking lace around you. It is all real.This is the best book I have ever read about the campaigns in this region of NY. As a serious student of loyalists and a reenactor with the Butler's Rangers, this gives me a better understanding of how a person in my ""real"" unit would have behaved in the wilds of Ny in 1777."
1,Dated and unconvincing,"This work by Michael Deaver was unimpressive to say the least. After considering the arguments presented I was left with very little understanding of the issues. Only a very basic theoretical framework is provided that offers the reader little to no insight into how to deal with the issue of Iraqi WMDs [that we have since found didnt exist].Furthermore, the author ""Michael V. Deaver"" has a dull writing style and fails to make any subject he speaks about interesting."
4,Genuine Eureka Product,These are genuine Eureka belts and they work.Do I really have to come up with more words?..Legit product.Legit vendor.
4,Webs of deceptions and murders,"I swear this was a shot in the dark when I read it and I never thought I would actually be hooked on it til the end. I am so glad I took a chance and read it.Iris Lanier, the main character, a forensic anthropologist; life was interrupted she received a telegram about her father who fell sick back in New York only to arrive to a realization that he had been shot in close range in some dark alley. Her father being there was totally out of character to her and mystery turned deeper and the web became bigger every each founding, only to find to a name that hadn't surface for a while, Clary; her long runaway mother. In search for the truth, she stumbled into webs of deceptions, murders and hidden crimes.The ending bugs me though. Bugs me to the bones cause I want to know about what happened to that one particular character. Hence why I gave it a four."
2,DEEP DO DO,"Booklist says this book has ""non-stop suspense.."" I wonder where they found it! ""Bone Deep"" is a lengthy, ill-plotted, overly complex ""thriller"", with no thrills. First of all, its heroine, Dr. Iris Lanier, is about as likeable as a skin rash. She is self-pitying, whiny, self-centered and socially inept. Delving into her past only makes her less likeable. There are so many inconsistencies in this plot, and the whole focus on Iris' dig in Guatemala has absolutely no integral part in the plot. Her relationship with her father is about as deep as a bottomless cup of coffee. The Angel Gabriel's character is so unbelievable, it's funny. Also, what about the couple Iris sees while staring at an apartment building across the street? What in the world was that supposed to mean? Her visit with Madame Zora--what a waste.There is so much wrong with this book, that by the time it reaches its preposterous conclusion, you can only ask yourself, ""Why did I read this?""Not recommended."
4,Like an edited usenet thread,"Reading through the subjects, its like a yuppy usenet thread. Zotti's research is pretty good, but it would actually benefit by being treated as a discussion thread because sometimes he misses some interesting links.""Why are yawns contagious?"" dodges answering the question -- even though there are good indicators from other human behavior (when people get seasick in unison).This book is a 10 for my curious 10-year-old, but only about a 5 for me"
1,Very Basic,I purchased this book in the hope it might be a good resource. I was wrong. The book is so basic as to be nearly useless to anyone with prior investigation training. There are some useful check lists that would help a novice investigator or claim representative.Someone should write a book or manual on insurance fraud investigation techniques. This book is a missed opportunity.
4,Pretty Good,"I've been a huge fan of RBF since I heard Why do they rock so hard, and I've loved them ever since. Each CD seems to have one song that I never stop repeating. This CD has a different feel to it than the others do. I can't really think of any song in particular that I could listen to non-stop. For whatever reason it sounds like RBF, but just a little different. If you loved their other albums, you'll probably like this one. Good album, but not their best."
1,Beware Explicit,"Wow just about bought this for a nephew as a gift when i listen to bit. I almost died, I know I am almost 40 but many unsuspecting families will gift this due to the covers and names, know what you are buying listen to the songs. Tons of kids are asking for Monkeys for nothin' and it is really rough. Just know what you are buying before you are ousted by the family as little ones overhear this one Christmas night."
2,Soap Opera Actress is victimized.,"Kristen (played by Catherine Oxenberg) is a soap opera actress. She's been receiving some weird fan mail from someone where she works. Then someone had put a knife in her purse. Her only comfort is her boyfriend, Phillip, played by David Naughton (An American Werewolf in London [1981]). There is also this crazy fan, played by Karen Black (Trilogy of Terror [1975-TV], The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver [1977-TV]) that rants at her at the studio gate when she tries to leave from work. But someone is really trying to scare her and is after her. The last 10 minutes will surprise you. This is a shorter film. Rated ""R"", it only runs 80 minutes."
5,Granny's Beverly Hillbillies Cookbook,"It wasn't exactly what I expected, it was better. Alongside the recipes are stories of the characters on the show. I loved it. And I received it very quickly and in great shape."
3,SanDisk CF 16MB,"Perfect for digital cameras and handhelds. It stores images orderly but it cannot store mp3's. Overall I think it is good for storing messages and images on handhelds, but can't be used for much more. It's just your standard memory card at a pretty good price."
4,Nice intimate view of my neighborhood,"Living west of Philadelphia, you get a sense of history just seeing old mill remnants and stone homes. This lets you see how they got there. My side of Aston, PA is the site of all this going on, people, mills, economics, religion. Neat book."
5,One of the three books that all Christians should own and read!,"This book is a stand alone classic that every Christian should read once a year. The other two books are C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"" and Bonhoeffer's ""The Cost of Discipleship"" . These three books stand wonderfully together and should be reflected upon right with the Bible."
5,Wonderful book!,"For those who really seek a deeper relationship with Christ, this is the book. It's a classic in Christian literature. Don't be put off by those who say since it was written by a monk that it has no relevancy in the secular life. The book is filled with wisdom. As with any other book there will be things the reader does not relate to, and things that seem written just for them. I have read it from page one, and read chapters randomly, and never failed to be enlightened in some way. The Imitation of Christ is a must read for those who are tired of sitting on the spiritual fence, and long for something other than the empty promises of this world."
4,Excellent,This is one of the best inspirational books I've encountered in a while. Worth every penny. I would suggest this book to everyone seeking a deeper understanding of Gods Word.
4,A hopeful look at a tolerant future,"Clarke Allan has crafted a touching and funny novel that glimpses an America where character and integrity matter more than sexual orientation. A grand look at a nation, no, a world, entranced by the substance and style of a dynamic First Couple. The First Man To Be First Lady, and the hero of the story, ""Clarke Kent"" (ok, that's a bit much), restores magnificence to the White House and hope to a fatigued nation."
1,strange,"This is obviously the author's attempt at putting his ultimate fantasy world on paper, and pollutes the reader's brain with homoerotic mush. It is apparent this masterpiece was edited by the author, who doesn't seem to use pronouns in place of names. This book gives me the creeps."
2,El Matador = El Sucko,"Listen to me. Don't buy this game. If someone wants to give it you, refuse it. Seriously, I paid $49 for this pathetic excuse for a third person shooter. I was bored after the first 30 minutes. No real storyline, just the repetitive action of shooting bad guys who somehow can shoot YOU while you are standing behind walls. Also, grenades can damage you even if you're nowhere near the explosion. The graphics weren't bad, expecially the jungle scenes. That's why I rated this game with 2 stars instead of one. I like third person shooters, and was hoping this would be one of those games like Rogue Trooper, which was very good.Save your money, but if you feel the need to blow 50 bucks, then take the money and flush it down the toilet. You'll get just as much satisfaction."
5,Just Be Ourselves,"This album blew my mind when it first came out (1972) - though not all the songs are wonderful, the integrity of the band's musicality was at least the equal of Chicago and BST, and, as a young musician, the harmonic vocabulary of JUST BE OURSELVES completely opened my ears. For anyone who likes Blood Sweat & Tears or Chicago, Dreams is a must-hear, and IMHO, this album is their definitive statement."
3,Good,"Dreams is good soul and funk featuring superstars like Billy Cobham and the Brecker Brothers.This is not the most imaginative of the genre, but does sound like later Blood Sweat and Tears without the smaltz. If you are looking for more obscure horn rock, this will fit the bill quite nicely."
4,Great DVD!,This is a great way to create ambience in a room when you are entertaining! It's a conversation piece and I always receive compliments.
2,Poor Quality,Not great. The shots of the fireplaces don't look very nice. On the second one the wood is not even piled in an orderly way. The serenity of the fish tank is ruined by some rather aggressive fish.
2,Not Realistic,"This DVD isn't realistic at all! Even on HD TV The picture was delayed, dvd kept skipping. I think you will understand why I had to return this item. I wouldn't suggest buying this item."
2,"Fireplaces, fishtanks and lava","Fires are good.Fishtank = boring, had expected more of an aspect of a larger aqaurium, like looking through the window into a tropical fish aquarium - to me this may as well have been looking at a goldfish in a little, round bowl.Also disappointed with lava. Had expected some footage of erupting volanoes...not a flippin' lava lamp.Anyway..musta ordered this in a rush without reading too much. Like I said, fireplaces (which was my primary goal) are good. Looked at the rest one time and no more."
2,"Fireplaces, Fishtank & Lava DEFICIENTE",En general es buena pero la falta mas calidad de resolución e imagen. Creo que se puede comprar pues si ambienta habitaciones pero no es de muy buena calidad.
4,"Love the fireplace, love the fish tank","I bought this for my husband as a gift. Some people are super-duper picky about their fireplace DVDs, but we are less so. I like this one. It is realistic enough, and not cheesy. We are still happy with it after a year at least.Once my son was born, I started using the fish tank track more than the fireplace. He's still in infant, and regular TV doesn't hold his attention. But if I need him to be still for a few minutes while I take care of something, I can put the fish tank on and he will stare at it in slack-jawed silence for several minutes. It also helps him calm down before bedtime, if he's had a bad day."
2,Resolution good for a camera phone...,"I was looking forward to some peaceful visuals that would allow me to put the mind's perception of the room into cruise control. This product didn't do it for me. All of the videos suffered from poor resolution... you could see the dithering. The fish tank audio was loud, the fish seemed to sense a shark in the waters... they were in hyper-drive. The fireplace scenes all seem to have been recorded in a wind-tunnel. The campfire audio was the best part of the DVD. There was no audio on the lava lamp which was OK. Would have been nice to have less aggressive colors for the lava, however."
4,Very Realistic,"Don't have a fireplace, and this looks great on my flat screen. Relaxing to read books with this on in the background. Crisp picture on my HD TV. Great sound quality, you can hear the fire crackling. Has 3 different fire's you can view, my favorite is the classic one. The video is about 30 minutes long, and automatically replays itself when it reaches the end. Pauses for about 5 seconds when it repeats itself. Not too noticeable.Also comes with a fish tank and lava lamp setting. Have never watches these, but nice to have the option."
4,"It's What I Wanted, But...","I really wanted a DVD screensaver for my TV so I can play music and what not and have something interesting on the TV screen. I like this DVD for what it offers (3 fireplaces, 1 fish tank and 1 lava lamp). All of the screen savers (except lava lamp) have audio with them (crackling fire / bubbling aquarium), but I'm not all that impressed with the quality of the video. I don't have the best flat screen TV, but video generally looks pretty good on there. The video on this DVD appears faded, so my only complaint with it is that the colors aren't as vibrant and the picture isn't as ""HD"" as I would like it to be, but I think it definitely does what I wanted something like this to do.Overall I would recommend it, but I may still keep my eyes peeled for a more ""HD"" DVD screen saver..."
5,Surprising,"My daughter loves going to the family's cabin and sitting around the campfire, so I was hoping to give her a similar feeling with this dvd. She LOVES it. She said it is so realistic she couldn't believe it. I was very surprised in the quality for such an affordable price. I purchased three of these and will probably purchase more. They make wonderful gifts. You won't be sorry."
5,Good buy,The video was a great buy for our household. The view of a fireplace thru your TV is breath taking. The shipping time was very good.
1,Don't waste your money. Buy a fish tank! Build a fire!,"The fire is OK, but nothing to write home about. The fish tank is the problem and was the reason I purchased the DVD. Someone went into a pet shop and set up a cheap camera focused at an ill-maintained tank with three fish in it that look like they were high on meth. Total waste of my money!"
4,Nice for what you pay for,"The quality is OK, not bad. Fish tank was a little bit of a let down. Lava Lamp was really creepy!!"
3,"Ok, but could be better","I love the crackling sound effects from the fire place but the picture quality is a little poor. The fish tank and lava scenes are no better. But, for the price I paid, it's worth the money."
2,No ambiance,It was lacking mood music. Nice pictures. Reminded me of a screen saver. I should have read the description better.
3,love video,"i love the video especially the fireplaces, very comfortin in this snowy weather here inMA, my granddaughter loves the aquarium and has me play it when ever she visits. However, the quality kind of sucks, but it does play as long as you want it too."
5,Buy one!,"This DVD and the little video fireplaces, fish tank and even the corny lava lamp are totally great.I love that you can play in a continuous loop. I saw ""fireplace for your home"" on Netflix, and was so addicted to it, that I decided shop for some alternative and similar fireplace/ambient whatnot dvd's, & I picked this one up. Its really entertaining for the $.Unlike ""fireplace for your home"" the 3 fires don't get too stale too fast because you can swap around and watch the various ones, Plus they loop, so you can let it stay on for hours!I like having the fireplaces on while I read a book, or while Im serving dinner, you can hear the crackling wood in the background and watching the flames is quite mesmerizing!"
4,Very warming,"I used the fireplace scene for Christmas day. I do not have a real fireplace so this helps and feels as though it truly warms the space. My family and friends had never seen anything like it, it became a topic of conversation. I do agree with an earlier post that states ""It sounds if it were recorded in a wind tunnel"", the fireplace crackles are somewhat hard to hear because of the ""wind"" noise. But overall I do recommend this product. The price was great."
4,Simple,We bought this for our toddler who is obsessed with fish and fireplaces so this works well for us. No hassle with caring for a real fish tank or cleaning up after using our fireplace. With his short attention span this is what we needed.
1,Poor Quality,"I think this is a poor visual quality DVD. I am not impressed with the fireplaces, the fish tank, or the lava. Would not have purchased this had I seen a preview."
3,Sort of lame,"The DVD was fine, but the fish tank portion was super lame. You could see that they used a video camera to film the fish. It was off center and overall unprofessional."
4,GREAT Book!,"This book was an underground classic, circulating in 'samizdat' -- i.e., Xerox -- format for over a year before it was finally published. I recommend it ""highly"" -- but then, I've used 'reality pills'!"
2,No music by Dylan on this,"While this video is interesting and has extensive interviews with Dylan's ""friends"" and former band mates in Minnesota, it's mostly a bunch of talking heads and no music by Dylan himself."
4,Very Decent Early Years Documentary,"The value in this film is the range of (as far as Im aware) previously silent commentators from Dylan's past. Friends from high school, early fellow band members, teachers and those who knew Dylan before he was Dylan. Worthwhile for that alone, but, despite a lack of Dylan music, the narrative is professional and the film very watchable."
1,Look at the title!,"Perhaps, the value of this DVD may be judged by the title. Look at the above scan. The title is misspelled!!"
3,Hmmmmmm......,"I'll be honest... I haven't seen this, so I can't critique the DVD's content... but one look at the DVD artwork and one must wonder how accurate the documentary is when the front photo features a reversed photograph. (At last look, I don't think Dylan was a left-handed guitarist.)"
4,Unhemmed a problem? Were they supposed to guess your inseam?,"These are fine pants for the money. As for their lack of a hem, I should think that any purchaser could expect this considering that they are not asked to provide an inseam length at purchase time."
5,Shut up and watch -,"Another boxset. Remove the staple holding your hand to your forehead, sit down and see what happens next.Our protagonists acquire three new bad guys (who can kick the asses of the worst they've had to deal with so far), knowledge of past lives and a cadre of bored gods and goddesses who you expect to wager on the outcome out of sheer ennui.This ain't your Daddy's Monkey King."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"The quality would have been fine; however, the hard hard mirror shell would not snap into the soft plastic backing. It appears that the soft plastic either shrunk or was molded to the wrong dimension. A waste of my time. Fortunately, Amazon made the return process fairly easy."
5,Nice,I find this to be a good buy. It is easy to installed and my acoustic can now be heard loud and clear.
2,Had to return,"This pickup worked for about a minuite, then nothing. I tried it on multiple amplifiers but eventually had to return it."
1,Is this a joke ?,"Lines of painted cloth turns into male genitalia. some smudges of black paint turns into a face on sheep's bottom. Everything is demonic. All delivered with straight faces.Oh, and did I mention penises. They seem to be all over the catholic faith.A waste of time. Funny and bizarre. But a waste of time."
5,Charming and fun,"I gave this book to my twelve-year-old daughter, who just started learning Spanish as well -- she's half-Hispanic and all Jewish -- and she's been quoting it to me ever since. Thank you, Rabbi Blech, for such an enjoyable read. This book and ""Haiku for Jews"" are the current favorites in our house."
3,fun but disappointing,"we were disappointed with the content and glossary of this book.it was fun to skim and read over, but it didn't offer us much of an indept exposure to the most common terms.we found that most of the words we looked up and were interested in just weren't there.otherwise, it is easy to read and laid out in an interesting format for skimming."
5,This Yiddish book is a Feast for the Senses,"While searching for a book that explains the Yiddish language for the common person, I came across this book and what a book it is! It entertains and explains not only the language but also the people, places and circumstances that shows how Yiddish came to be. There are colorful examples, jokes and sayings to make anyone laugh! I found this to be quite an entertaining book, even if you have little interest in Yiddish."
4,Great Island Album,"Hann's Reef is an awesome band. I love island music and they sound great on this CD.I also recommend an album by Key West, Beach Balls and Alcohol."
3,Okay,"I've listened to this CD 3-4 times now and what comes to mind is a comment from Simon Cowell: ""It sounds like someone singing karaoke."" To me, this CD sounds too contrived and too planned. It doesn't come across as heart-felt or real. I've never seen this band in concert and maybe I need to so I can appreciate them more. It isn't bad music if you like Jimmy Buffett and want songs that sound like he would write if he were still working the bar circuit. It is just missing the energy. It's an OK CD."
3,An IKEA product marked up and resold,"This is LITERALLY a product from IKEA marked up 150% and resold. They didn't even bother changing the name.The same item retails at IKEA for $2.99. If there is an IKEA store near you, save yourself some money and get it there. Too bad they don't have a serious online store.See for yourself: google this product's name and IKEA."
5,magasin cultery caddy,very well constructed - easy to place more than one side by side. the best designed caddy i have found
2,We are confused,"The concept of this series was interesting , book by book I looked forward to whose honor would be restored. The last two books have let me down. They are violent rather than punitive. I particularly take exception to The Jury. I feel the author did not know what direction to go in. Are we going after those who are cruel to animals, are we uniting Nikki with Jack ? If so why do we knock off another mother and child? Why does Julia have to die. The story line is disjointed and unclear. Each incident could have been three complete story lines. I will continue reading the series just because I am curious about the different outcomes. I hope the future additions have more clarity, more story and less violence"
1,The Jury,This book is typical Fern Michaels. Her books have gone from bad to worse over the years. It is uneven and confusing to read. It is full of dishonesty and betrayal of trust.
2,Confused by the plot,"While I have enjoyed other Fern Michaels Revenge of the Sisterhood books, this book was confusing in the beginning, perplexing in the middle and a let down in the end. First, why was there even a plot about extracting revenge for the horse farm owners, then abruptly that plot went away, conveniently resolving the issue on its own? There wasn't any good reason to even have that plot in the book. And how did the fired attorney just go away on her own? And (caution-spoiler to follow), why in the world was the daughter of the judge killed off (unless there's another story line here)? It added nothing to the book! And the ending-why oh why would the wife of the National Security Advisor come out of hiding to be with her husband after the guy was almost beaten to death in retaliation by the Sisterhood? Why would she even want to be near him? I haven't a clue."
3,A DISAPPOINTING NUMBER FOUR,"This book is number four in The Sisterhood series from Fern Michaels. After much excitement, suspense and surprises in the first three books, Weekend Warriors, Payback & Vendetta, this one, The Jury, is a big disappointment. Although we are led to believe that Nikki will choose Jack as her revenge, she chooses him for something else. Her turn ends up getting put off till certain people can be located and it's frustrating when you think her revenge will be one thing and ends up being another, which isn't really her ""turn"" at all. I wasn't on the edge of my seat like I was with the other books."
2,The Verdict is In,"I didn't realize I had read the Weekend Warriors untill checking my books read list, but don't recall the story line at all so I felt like I was just reading a chapter of book also rather than a complete story that supports itself. My advice to the reviewer that doesn't want the story line revealed before she reads the book is: Don't read the reviews first. That's simple enough. I was ready to quit reading several times but stuck with it. I won't be following the rest of the series."
3,A little disappointing,"I love Fern Michaels books and I think I've read just about everyone of them - the Sisterhood series seems to be really disjointed, almost like they took one big book and divided it up into sections. In this book there are a lot of unanswered questions, which I assume means there will be another book on the way.The relationship between Nikki and Jack gets a little more clear. Some sad points, some funny points, but there definitely should have been more story."
5,Another Sweet Adventure with the Sisterhood!,I thoroughly enjoy the inner workings of the sisterhood....wish I could join a chapter!
1,Hard to finish...not worth reading,"I wanted to like this book, but the plot was very disturbing-how can anyone feel positive about a book that endorsed this kind of ending?Women who can outwit the government in this fashion? Yeah, sure.Everyone has a BMW? Yeah, right.They don't get caught when they spy? They always get the info they want? That's realistic...And what happens to the horses? This book was over-dramatized and the characters were 1-Dimensional. The writing showed promise, but didn't deliver. I won't be reading any other books by this author, sad to say."
5,Brian Jonestown Massacre's best - and a must have,"For anyone seeking a wonderful music experience this is the album to own. Spanning the decades of rock and strangely beyond rock, BR&N is an experience to be felt. A mix of complex psychedelia and simple melodies any spohisticated listener will not be disapponted."
1,Complete mediocrity,"Compared to the other Brian Jonestown albums, this one is lackluster. The band sounds lethargic and uninspired, a big contrast to the previous albums that I love so much. If you don't have all the other albums, I would recommend any of them before this one (especially Give It Back!, Thank God For Mental Illness, or Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request). If you have all of them except this one, do not let your perception of the band be ruined by this disaster. I had every single Brian Jonestown release, but I sold my copy of this one. I recommend buying a different CD....a few possibilities being Odessey & Oracle by The Zombies, The Move's Movements box set, or either of the Creation Complete Collection volumes, to name a few."
3,Refrigerator Thermometers,"I purchased two identical refrigerator /freezer thermometers. One is for the regrigerator comparment, the other for the freezer. However, just out of curiosity I placed them BOTH in the same compartment. They do not show the same temperature, which indicates to me that at minimum on is not working properly, but how do I know which one?"
1,Cheaply made like all KitchenAid thermometers,"I am brand-loyal to KitchenAid with a stove, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, 2 mixers, blender and even towels. That said every KitchenAid Thermometer is cheaply made and not worthy of the brand name. If this costs $2 at my local grocery store I'd still think I over paid. I bought the oven, meat and refrigerator thermometers (all at once) and they're all cheaply made and not very accurate. I regret the purchase and would not suggest you look elsewhere (except for anything made by Cuisinart which I despise)."
2,Not really a book,The author has taken what would have been a fine essay and tried to turn it into a short book. Unfortunately he has chosen endless repetition of the same facts and opinions rather than increased deapth and insight to do so.
5,Much props to a soul blues diva!,"This lady has pretty nice unique sound. I must say that I am quite pleased with this title cd. I enjoyed all of the tunes that are on here. I plan on purchasing her other titled cds as well. Especially, ""Love Fest"". Plus, she is a looker on the front cover of this cd as well."
1,poor for beginner,"The book has two CDs but only little audio files. The reading is also too fast for beginners who want to learn to speak Mandarin. If you are a beginner, do not buy this book. If you want the audio CDs to contain more in the chapters, you will want to skip this book."
3,Not for beginners,"Previous reviews led me to believe that this would be a good overall book, for both training and reference. However, this book is obviously aimed at people who have experience with previous versions of Crystal Reports, not for people who are just starting out. I will probably keep it as a refence guide, but will need to find something else to use as a beginners guide."
3,Crystal Reports XI The Complete Reference,"Crystal Reports XI: The Complete Reference (Complete Reference Series)So far I have found it useful on the job.Of course, it could have more examples at a level a step or two above the obvious."
3,Not a complete reference,This is one of many books that I have purchase that just act as a standard users manual for the product. What I was looking for are those things that you would usually get in a users manual. I'm trying to develop a table of contents for my report and an index and this book covers neither. The concept that is not being covered is that Crystal Reports really only make one pass at the database to retrieve data so how would you create a table of contents.
4,Good find!,"The only place I could find the 4"" yoga blocks was on-line. These work just fine and it was suggested by our yoga instructor to have your own blocks with the oncoming flu season. I was pleased with the cost of the blocks, $13.99 for two, but the more than $6.00 shipping surprised me."
4,Good size all around,"The blocks arrived sooner than the expected 7 - 10 day estimate in great condition and no funny odor. I consider myself somewhere in the intermediate category of yogingi/yogis and am all for props. Almost 3 years into my practice, I just started using them in the past 6 months and they make a world of difference with my alignment also easing me into the correct form of new asanas I never thought I would be able to do. The blocks are sturdy and firm (comfortable for sitting on). Light weight and durable (work well in-between the shins/calves while standing or on the ground)."
1,"Good product, But....",The quality of this product is fine. Sorry - I cannot get past the god awful taste! I tried mixing it with apple sauce and it just nauseates me. I moved on to pills as this powder taste like a toxic chemical.
4,Nice Music,"This is a nice, soft score. It makes for good background music. I can't say how it helps or hurts the movie, since I've not seen it. The music itself, though, is quite beautiful."
5,The MOVIE was EXCELLENT -- and the MUSIC is SWEET,A movie soundtrack -- I highly recommend the movie; then the soundtrack will be all the more meaningful! Great piano music played by the incredible Lang Lang!!!
4,Thought provoking,The music makes the movie linger and the movie is even better than the book. Too bad the CD does not include the children's A La Claire Fontaine sung near the end of the movie. It has been in my head for days. How could they leave that off? I would have bought the CD just for that little haunting song.
4,Good for peeling and good grip,This peeler has a good grip and is sharp to make for quick and easy peeling of fruits and potatoes. It is also very easy to clean. The Kitchenaid brand is reliable and it compliments other Kitchenaid items in my kitchen!The reason for the 4 stars:I frequently peel potatoes and I used to own a peeler with a little tip shaped like a little trowel to dig out eyes of a potato. This peeler doesn't have that function.
5,Great Peeler,"The Kitchen Aid Stainless Steel Euro Peeler, is a sturdy tool for peelin vegetables, fruits and more. It also can be used for making cheese curls."
3,not what I hoped it would be,"I purchased this book because it had been given 5 stars, but I wish I could have looked inside at the pages beforehand. With 700 entries, one would think this book would have a huge number of accompanying illustrations. But no. For every 7-10 entries, you get a mere one full page picture and sometimes a rather small picture or two. As I read each entry, I had no idea of what most of these dinosaurs even looked like, aside from knowing what general group it belonged to. It left me wishing I had bought a different dinosaur encyclopedia."
3,I wish there were more Illustrations,"The 'Book Fair' was at my school, when I bought this book. I read a couple of entries and I couldn't stop reading. The only thing I wish they could add to the book is more Illustrations. The print is average size, I guess, and another thing that bothered me was that, it covers almost all the dinosaurs. I was watching a progarm on dinosaurs, and I was trying to look up the dinosaurs but couldn't find them. I reccomend this book for ""Dinosaur Lovers"" 7-20 of age."
1,Do not buy,I bought this book because I owned the traditional spanish version translated by Fray Luis de Granada and wanted a more modern translation. I found the kindle version has many misprints and many paragraphs are also missing. I recommend you do not buy this version.
4,Bueno!,"Arrived on time. Nice large print, like the fact that it is a hard cover. Price was right. Bought several copies for my friends!"
2,"OK, but no scrubbing action","The box on my unit said ""Dual Brush Action"", which apparently means that the brush drags on the carpet whether you're pushing it forwards or backwards. I had assumed that ""action"" meant the brush actually moved (silly me). Please note that I did not buy mine from Amazon, and that dubious ""Dual Brush Action"" claim is conspicuously absent in the description here.This model SteamVac works well enough (how wrong can you go with hot detergent water?) but not nearly as well as the fancier Hoovers that have rotating brushes, which I have also used. I don't think the modest price difference comes close to compensating for the loss in cleaning power. I'll be trading mine for a better model with a moving brush."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I wish I'd spent more and bought a better model with the power brushes. This model does an adequate job and is simple enough to operate that I use it frequently. I wish that they had made it so that the front cover over the area where the water is sucked up could be cleaned. I hate putting it away with the gunk like carpet fibers and lint in there (ok, so I'm a little obsessive)."
4,SteamVac by Hoover,This is definatly a great buy for the money. This particular steam vac is easy to use and deep cleans carpets and floors extremely well. It also has attachments to clean furniture. After using the difference is remarkable. Looks like it was professionally cleaned. If it can clean my carpet with a toddler and 3 indoor/outdoor dogs who bring the dirt from the backyard in onto the carpet. Then it can cleans anyones. Awesome buy for the money. Great customer service.
1,Leaves carpets wet and hard floors drenched!,"I purchased this today and was very excited to use it. Unfortunately, it's going back to the store asap. As mentioned before, there's no steam. There's also no brush action. The ""power"" hand tool that came with mine is not attached to any power source.I was most disappointed, however, when I tried to use the dry floor attachment with my tile floors. It left them as wet as if I spilled a glass of water--there's no extraction power whatsoever there. The carpets are quite damp, but should dry. I did see a difference in the cleanliness of the carpets, but not enough to make this worth the money.All-in-all, this is a cheap product that uses misleading statements to represent itself as something it's not.Buyer beware."
5,One of the Great Recordings of Occassional Music,"Like the other reviewer stated, I've been listening to this record for many years too. George Winston aside, It's unusual that a label sampler will release the best album cuts (or at least outstanding) from each artist. It's sad to realize that Windham Hill let Ira Stein and Russell Walder's Elements record and Darol Anger and Barbara Higbie's Tideline records go out of print. Of all the samplers and artist releases by Windham Hill when they seems a real speciality label with an amazing mission and focus, this one the finest records from those great days. It's a classic."
3,"Amazing illustrations, weak story.","The illustrations in this book are beautiful and amazing. Unfortunately, this book isn't merely a picture book. It is also a story book, and the story doesn't have a lot to it. Essentially, a boy with a polar bear comes to a girl's house in the snow, and his bear scares away the trolls that steal Christmas supper. No part of the story is very well developed, and it really is kind of boring. At least I think it is, as do the kids in my life. However, the illustrations are magical. So, what to do? Check it out at the library. Not worth a purchase."
5,grandma,You can't go wrong with a Jan Brett book. They are keepsakes. This story keeps the little one's interest.
1,Amazed this is a kids book!!!????,"I was shocked that this book had a high rating. My daughter just brought this home from her library at school and I read it to her tonight. The story was so odd, and weird for a children's story. Mean trolls that break into the cottage, etc. Just plain weird in my opinion and certainly not a ""Christmas type story"" you might expect from the title!!!"
4,A magical journey,Jan Brett's beautifully illustrated book accompanies a simple story that young children would enjoy. Each Christmas the trolls come and eat Kyri's Christmas feast. This year a boy from Finnmark on his way to Oslo with his ice bear will help chase the trolls away! My grandchildren love this book! They love looking at the illustrations and talking about the various things in them and of course laughing at the piggy trolls!
4,Who's That Knocking On Christmas Eve?,I read who's That Knocking On Christmas Eve? I thought it was a fun book to read because it would be like you where in the book yourself. I think you would like it Kids age 9 to 11. I highly recommend this book. I hope you like this book
3,Hoover S2610 Quik-Broom,"I found that this vacuum does not lie flat enough to get under even moderately low furniture. Also it has no way to stand up by itself without falling. Otherwise, I do like the vacuum. It seems to have sufficient suction and I do like the on/off beater bar option."
1,Perpetually clogged,"I have used an ""electric broom"" for years for my hardwood floors. This is my 3rd one and up until this vacuum, I loved these small simple vacuums. On this Quick-Broom Hoover, however, the bagless feature is completely inoperable. After vacumming a few times a week for a month, there will be a couple of grains of sand in the visable easy-to-empty dirt container. All of the dirt, dust, dog hair, spilled food, etc. is converted to a greyish-brownish mat and is housed above the dirt container clinging to an internal non-disposable filter. In order to ""empty"" this vacuum you have to turn the filter (which is like a non-removable bag) inside out and hand pick out the greyish brown mat of gunk. In other words, its perpetually clogged -- the dirt container has never had more than a few grains of sand in it. In all fairness, I do have a sheltie who has long hair and its possible that this vacuum might work in a household without animals. But......I would suggest you buy at your own risk."
3,Good product but not very sturdy,"I've had this same model of vaccuum cleaner for several years, and really enjoyed it, when after a while, the motor burned out in the beater brush area. I purchased another one, thinking okay, I'll have this one for at least three years like the other one. Nope. The new one only lasted about a month, and burned out, in the exact same area. If purchasing this vaccum make sure that you clean any hair that wraps itself around the roller, out of the brush or it will burn out on you very quickly."
4,Open & skeptical minds alike,"Indeed, it is refreshing to read account by someone both skeptical and entertained by the gear heads, believers, profiteers and prophets who encircle Dreamland. Vital part of any curious mind's attempt to unravel the legend, security and independent investigations. Covers a lot while offering source checking and allowing the cast and camps to argue their own perspectives and theories. Very enjoyable."
5,A good overview of Area 51 and the culture around it.,"This is probably the best non-fiction book published so far about Area 51. If you want some fun reading in the fiction area, try Robert Doherty's series of books starting with AREA 51. It's fun to read both Darlington and Doherty's books and compare the people in them."
4,"An exploration, not of Area 51, but the mystique of Area 51","This book I would warmly recommend to anyone interested in the patchwork quilt of subcultures which make up the United States. A well-written and humorous book, I was very glad that Darlington did not spend much time speculating about Area 51, but rather wrote this book as a recounting of the folklore and a cross-section of the many kinds of people which inhabit the area and in their own ways contibute to ""Ufology."""
4,People not Aliens,"This book is not really about Area 51, it's about the people obsessed with the place, and their battles with the US government. Sure there's background detail but Darlington obviously finds the conspiracy phenomenon and the way it alters lives more interesting than trying to find 'the truth'.Very funny but also quite depressing, one gets the sense that Darlington is trying to show how these individual obsessions with Area 51 are ultimately futile, like flies swatted by a mad horse."
5,Interesting and Innovative,"A very unusual album from a Hawaiian musician. Unlike any other Hawaiian album I've heard in its diversity of style and technique. The vocals on some tracks are perhaps a little of an acquired taste but the imaginative musical outlook and playing is excellent. For the most part very gentle and not at all about blazing speed or technique for its own sake (so I'm not sure what's up with that other review?). There are some really nice instrumental tracks on here.The liner puts it thusly (and pretty accurately): ""Makana transcends category and trend by integrating elements of folk, rock, ethnic, classical, bluegrass, jazz, traditional, ambient and slack key music in gentle to commanding arrangements."" It never sounds derivitive or forced and does touch on most of those elements (I don't hear much of the classical or bluegrass parts and not a lot of the jazz except perhaps in phrasing). Generally low key but keeps your attention. Not your Grandma's Hawaiian music..."
4,Good compas for land nav.,"I recieved this compass in short order and it was well packaged and no damage what so ever. This is a real good compass. I am use to the older style military compass and this one is even better. I use it for land navigation with topo maps just like i did in the army. This is top af the line easy to use, durable, and not like those easy to brake plastic garbage compasses. I deffinitly reccomend this. I rearly if ever give a 5 star rateing but this one came close."
5,BugSmasher,"I find this is a great compass, I recommend it 100%. I've relied on two other hand held compasses in the bush over the years also in conjunction with GPS units but for a hand held compass , this compass is the answer even if your relying on GPS , I'm a firm believer in having a compass for back up. I find the night visibility of this unit outstanding ,one more little note, Don't lend it out !"
1,$10 CHINESE JUNK SENT,Review for U.S. Issue Mil-Spec Tritium Illuminated Aluminum Military Lensatic Marching Compass (Misc.)from BIGFLYSPORTS. The item sent was not a Cammenga Tritium Illuminated Military Lensatic Compass. It did not have any Tritium light sources. It did not have a durable waterproof cast aluminum case painted olive drab. It did not have a lanyard and a carrying pouch with rear belt clip. It was not made in the United States. IT WAS MADE IN CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a cheap imitation worth about 1/10 of what I paid for it. Don't buy this item because the description is not what you will receive. Rating should be zero stars.
1,Cheap Chinese knock off,"The rating should be zero. This is a scam product, do not purchase. The advertising leads you to believe it's a military grade field compass. Once you receive the product you know before even opening the packaging you've been had. This is a Chinese knock off not the real thing. Walmart $7.00 compasses are higher quality than this."
5,Just like the Marine Corps issues,Which is about all that needs said. I have used some very good civilian marketed compasses but keep coming back to the tried and true lensatic as issued by the Corps.
3,Still Needs Work,"The focus of this dictionary is mathematical statistics, not applied statistics, and is intended for graduates and professionals. The definitions are not simple and include lots of equations. There is no other dictionary like it and it has the potential for being developed into a very useful handbook. I think it needs a lot of work, though. First, the coverage is lacking. I could not find many terms that should be in a dictionary targeted at professionals (cf. Dodge). Second, many of the definitions could stand revising for clarity (cf. Upton & Cook). Third, while there are many figures, they don't always illustrate the point as well as they could (cf. Sahai & Khurshid; Upton & Cook)."
4,Sharp and it's dishwasher safe.,Like all of Kitchen Aid's products this pizza wheel is top notch. I use it weekly. The blade is huge and sharp and when finished using toss it right in the dishwasher.
5,"Solid, sharp wheel replaces scissors or knives and has a great protective sleeve","This pizza wheel is heavy-duty and feels very solid in your hand. It's sharp enough to cut through a very hard/crunchy crust, and you don't have to worry about it skidding off the pizza.An added bonus is that the protective sleeve extends about 1/4-inch beyond the wheel to protect the entire rim of the wheel. It fits snugly and won't slide off in the drawer. (The pictures don't show this very well and give the appearance that the sleeve covers only half the wheel--but rest assured it's better than that.) If you prefer to hang your utensils, there's a large hole for hanging at the end of the handle.This wheel may cost a bit more than others, but it's worth it."
3,Your Personal Opion,"I did not care for the adventure the movie brought me, but if you liked the book Heyerdahl wrote you should enjoy this classic. I am more interested in romance such as Jewel of the Nile.This movie took me through jungles and oceans. So my personal opinion is that everyone has there own opinon and just because I did not enjoy this book/movie does not mean you won't."
5,a classic,"i've been poor as of late. to the point that i've sold most of my cd's. this is one that i've held on to. and now that i see i could sell my mint copy for over $20, i would still never do it knowing i could never get it back. this is one of those albums i continually go back to and lost myself in. i rediscovered my dad's old windham hill vinyls back in 96 and this is one of those albums i heard countless times as a child, so putting it back on as a young adult was like deja vu in the best possible way. the songs are all great, the recording is great. i agree with a previous poster that they should release a new version of this disc with new tracks because they must exist. but even if they did release it again, i'd never part with this original, just as i won't ditch my original copies of ""december"" ""autumn"" and ""winter into spring"" in favor of the 20th anniversary editions."
2,Deceptive title. Should be called vinegar recipie book,This book does not tell you how to make vinegar. It tells you how to flavor it. It was disapointing since I brew beer and make wine. I was hoping to make base vinegars out of my leftover wine. Oh well.
4,Flavored vinegars made easy.,"This book cleary walks the reader through making flavored vinegars easily in their own home. I enjoyed the informal, chatty style the author used. My only complaint is that I would have liked a few more recipes for using the flavored vinegars, especially more ordinary dishes. Some of the recipes are a little too much on the gormet side for me and the poeple I'll be giving my vinegars to. Otherwise than that this is great way learn about flavored vinegars."
2,Not what I was expecting,I thought this was about how to make vinegar from scratch but it wasn't. This tells you how to make flavored vinegar from store bought vinegar only. If that is what you are looking for then this is perfect for you. I shall keep looking for the perfect booklet. Disappointed.
1,Don't bother,"I recently installed this program and I am very disappointed with it. I find it poorly organized; for example if you want to learn to simply count from 1-10 in a language, you will have to jump around to find each number which are between 40% and so forth. It isn't very helpful to learn how to say ""fifth"" and then 50% and then five for instance when you are just beginning a language. I found ""hello"" in Spanish, but then ""goodbye"" was nowhere to be found. If you are starting from scratch and want to learn a new language, I don't recommend this CD. However, it does contain several different languages in one program. I have also found that it crashes often when you use the sound on it and since I have 64MB ram and this program suggests only 16MB, I was upset that it is such a memory hog. I am ready to remove it from my computer and sorry I wasted the money on it."
5,Silicon Protective Case for Blackberry,"This cover is small enough that the phone will still fit into cellphone holders in a purse or book bag, but strong enough to protect the phone when dropped."
4,Satisfied with this product,"I have the 1 GB version of the M-Flyer and I love it. The speed is fast so I don't know what the other reviewer is complaining of.The retractable USB design is awesome and the blue indicator light and design make this USB drive stand out from others.The reason I give this only 4 stars is that it is a little wide, so if you want to use another USB port next to where this drive is, you won't be able to. However, Memorex supplies a 4-5 inch USB extension to get around this. I just don't want to carry this around with me."
2,No change in health observed,"Well, I've taken this product and no change in health observed whatsoever. Big bottle of NOTHING."
1,The sound quality on this CD is terrible,"The sound quality on this CD sounds like it was recorded in 1950 and has never been remastered, or maybe that it was recorded from a 1950 record playing. I love these artists, but this CD is useless to me."
5,"Wow - great production values, fantastic singing","I love this production. It is exciting. The dancing, the costumes all left me at the edge of my seat. The acting is excellent, the singing superb. Yes it is dubbed, but that does not detract from the overall effect. I watched it all the way through, then watched it again it was so exciting."
2,Beware,I was fairly happy with the unit until it refused to copy files from my Kingston Elite Pro (50x) SD card. Their tech support blamed the card that it used outdated technology and I needed 80x or faster card. They should probably put correct information on their product page about which cards actually work with this unit. I do not appreciate being misled.
1,Does not work with 2GB SD Cards,This memory card reader refused to copy files from my SanDisk 2GB Extreme III memory card.
2,Difficult to get into,Had high expectations for this book after reading other reviews but found it difficult to get into. Only made it about half way through before I put it down; couldn't keep focused on it.
5,Always a runner,"If you are looking for an amazing book to read--whether you are a serious runner or not, or not even a runner at all--this novel will captivate and keep your attention, and leave you marveling at the language and descriptions--the pictures painted by Parker. When I finished the book for the first time, I could have turned it back to the front cover, started reading it again, and enjoyed it just as much, if not more than the first time through. A spectacular read--inspirational, humorous and serious at the same time."
5,The best book about running I've ever read,"I have never read a book about running the encapsulates the spirit of training, intensity competition and the mindset of distance running that Parker writes about in this book. It is a fantastic book that I get more out of every time I read it."
5,An Inspiring Story,"""Once a Runner"" by John L. Parker, jr. is the story that everyone on a journey of Mastery should read. This is the archetypal story of Rocky, Vision Quest, The Karate Kid and the Wandering Daoist. The idea of letting the rest of life go in order to make a dream come true (represented by the main character's retreat from society)and become completely one with the activity is the fantasy of every athlete and artist and is represented beautifully in ""Once a Runner"".Quenton Cassidy is on track to run a four minute mile when a choice to protest the Viet Nam war gets him kicked off of his college team. He lets go of his dream only to have it revived by Master runner and Gold medalist Bruce Denton. It's then that Cassidy retreats from the world to train, Spartan-like in a monastic retreat.I loved this book and will count it among the novels that I will read and re-read.A classic!"
2,overrated,"What does one want from a running book? A good story? Good descriptions of running? This book is short on both. The characters are very flat, the story is trite and the running scenes are mediocre. Among runners it is very popular; I suppose this is because they are desirous of anything connected with their normally marginalized sport. I am a runner, so I can sympathize, but I can not concur in calling this book ""good"" or ""great"". It is written for runners by a runner; a runner who, can not write, I might add: a good high school writer could have come up with such slop. Poorly conceived, poorly written. It will make no waves outside of running circles. Only a novel which aspires to be great literature as well as great literature about running will be successful or worth reading. Borrow this from a friend or find it at the library, but dont expect ""a cult classic"". The classic novel on running is yet to be written."
1,DON'T TRY TO ORDER THIS ITEM,"This book is always advertised, yet NEVER in stock after you pay for it. I've tried to order it from 4 different people and all 4 didn't actually have it."
4,I need to go for a run now...,"I was a miler in high school and now run marathons for ""enjoyment"". This book puts the training and runners guilt into perfect perspective.If you were ever a competitive athlete you understand things like rivalries but unless you were a runner you will never understand the ""demons"" that haunt us. We are our own worst enemy...we are the ultimate rival.Once a Runner takes you through what it means to be competing against the best, yourself, and just what it takes to beat the best runners in the world.With simplistic writing Once a Runner captures a runners heart, adrenaline and competitive spirit...makes me want to go run quarters, almost."
3,Maybe I expected too much,"For all the years I've been running and reading running publications--more than twenty--this book has been held up as an archetypal description of the running life, so I was eager to read it once it came back into publication. It may well be evocative for the gifted runner whose running life is his only life, but most of us who run are not that guy. Most of us have injuries and time constraints which would prevent us from running the equivalent of several marathons a week. Many of us are not even guys. Title Nine and the involvement of women in collegiate sports are a big change in the thirty years since this book was published.That said, this book is worth reading for its snapshot of a period of running history, important in the development of our sport."
2,Decent if skimmed...,"I bought this book with high hopes and, disappointed, happily left it on the plane I finished it on. Not a keeper. Not a mythical text handed down from one sage inspired runner to another - as promised. There's a reason this was sold out of the back of the author's car and not published out right to begin with - it's a juvenile, go nowhere story that surrounds a few gems of elite running lore, repeating what you knew but may have forgotten from your own running career at some point in your life. Sift through the book to find these gems and suspend what little temptation you may suffer to follow the story. Practice this kind of efficiency and you'll be pleased but not overwhelmed. Save your money and borrow it from a friend, the library, or look in the seat pocket of the person in front of you...you never know."
5,Great Entertainment for Runners,The running tidbits are an integral part in this story about a young man and his life in college. It's an entertaining read for runners and non-runners alike.
2,So-So,I personally did not like this book and found the plot development to be slow. I was only able to make about three quarters of the way through the book and just couldn't make myself finish it.
2,Fell asleep,Have to admit: fell asleep several times while trying to finish this book.Right now it is back in the bookshelves only half-read.
5,A genuine classic!,"If you are a long distance runner, you will enjoy this novel. (Especially if you came of running age in the 70's or 80's.)"
1,Warning to new runners,"To those people who have just completed Couch-to-5k and are looking for a little inspiration as they continue their running journey--this book is NOT for you. Within the first 10 pages of this painfully smug book, people like you are dismissed as ""fatties"" who will never understand the plight of the naturally gifted. My fear is that the only thing you will learn from this novel is that elite runners are massive jerks with over-inflated egos (which, by the way, is not true). So save your time for something truly inspirational, not this dated, latently sexist drivel, and remember that running is for everyone--including those of us with love handles."
1,"Too much vulgarity for me, thank you","The book appears to get rave reviews for its technical merit, even though it's a fictional work. I will never know. I bought the Kindle version of the book, and midway through chapter 2, I knew I couldn't, in good conscience as a Christian, finish reading it. Having spent 3 years in the Army, and 23 in the Navy, I've had my share of exposure to foul language, and even practiced it a bit, but it seems this book goes to extreme measures to use the name of God in vain, and to speak in terms that would make a sailor blush. I did a search of a few of the 'off-color' words I could think of, and the hits astonished me - enough to cause me to cease and desist. I had to check to be sure this wasn't written by Al Pacino. I've belonged to a running club for a number of years, and we don't talk like that. It's a shame, because I really enjoyed ""Heart Rate Training for the Compleat Idiot"". Hard to believe this book is by the same author."
5,makes me want to run until I die of heart failure,"I love underdog stories. Probably because as a skinny white guy going to Duke to play basketball, I am an underdog. But damnit, this book is awesome. It makes you want to conquer the world. The writing, as far as I can tell, is very good. It had me mezmarized and made my heart race with anticipation. If you're a runner, a basketball player, or any serious athlete who knows what it's like to push yourself to a point where you feel like you're going to die, and then go above and beyond, this book is an absolute must."
3,Best book about running ever written?,"Reader's Digest dubs this book as ""best book ever written about running!"" I would have to respectfully disagree. Can it be the best ""novel"" ever written about running? Maybe! The story as a whole, in my opinion, is a little dry; it lacks the ""kick"" that every ""good"" book has in the story. I don't want to give anything away, but overall this book is Decent. The last few chapter are amazing; besides that it's just your average book.Maybe, I expected a lot from this book after reading numerous reviews about it. But pick a copy and decide for yourself.On a side note, if you looking for a good book on running; I would recommend Born to Run and My Life on the Run. Two great books on running, that can motivate even the laziest individual to get out and run. Believe me, I was that individual..."
4,"""There is color in everything you do.""","I'll admit, this isn't the greatest EBM album ever made but there sure are some highly addictive songs here. I've owned SEVER & COLLAPSE by Mono Chrome for several years now and still have the desire to listen to it from time to time. And, frankly, you can't go wrong with anything Victoria Lloyd (best known for her work with Claire Voyant) is a part of. Blend her ethereal vocals in with the electro-dance beats provided by members of Cut.Rate.Box and you've got yourself a sort of mix of the two groups. There's a great remix of ""Riveted"" by A23 as well, and ""This Death"" is a haunting, more mellow counterpart to ""This Life"" (mostly same lyrics, just different feel).Overall I found this album to be quite enjoyable."
2,Didn't last long,I bought one of these in February '08. It worked fine. Very handy. But now it is November '08 and I am shopping for another scale because the digits are flaking out. Some of the number-component cells are dead so it could be a 6 or an 8 or??. Maybe it is normal that a cheap digital display only lasts so long but I am looking for another brand.
2,"Minimal quality, too expensive","I bought this peeler because of my husband's love of Kitchenaid products. Even though it looks pretty, I don't like it as well as the plain little peelers that most of us already have.The peeling blades don't grip the carrots and potatoes as well, it seems to slip. And the peelings don't fall off the peeler, they build up into a clump and I have to manually pull them out of the peeler. So it ends up taking a lot longer, and just doesn't work as cleanly as it should.The other thing I didn't like about this peeler was the price. If it worked real well, I guess it would be worth it, but since I was disappointed with the performance of the product, the price is just too much."
3,Ok utnesil,"This is ok for peeling veggies and potatoes. Not sometrhing I would buy again. I have a couple of ""Good Grips"" by Oxo that I like a lot better."
4,A handy little guide,"This is a very good guide for those new to yoga but make sure you rent a few videos too or better yet take a class if possible. Yoga Zone videos are my favorites but I also adore Steve Ross's show ""Inhale"" on the Oxygen channel to get me moving. This guide details yoga's origins and outlines the different versions of Hatha yoga while explaining the poses and giving you guidelines for creating your own practice. It's a little on the crunchy side and even goes into detail about a yogi's diet which is something I will never ever be able to follow. Give up sugar, are they nuts?!"
4,Almost heaven,"I really love Kirchschlager's singing here. This is a wonderful collection ofBach arias from his cantatas. The fact that ""Schlumert Ein"" was really writtenfor Bass/Baritone doesn't diminish my enthusiasm. Kirchschlager simply sings ittwo octaves higher. And this collection contains one of the most beautiful ariasfrom a cantata: Widerstehe Doch der Sunde (from cantata No. 54). The CD is reallyworth it's purchase price just to hear these two selections.But this CD does include Mr. Carmignolas' name (as violin obligato), on the cover.Trouble is, that I mostly don't hear him (on this recording). Either the engineerdid not have him miked correctly, or else, perhaps Carmignola should have put asteel E string on his fiddle?But if you love the arias in Bach cantatas, or just love Bach. Then do give this CDa listen. It is very, very good."
5,MIRAMAX NEEDS TO MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE,"While reading and giggling my way through this book, the thought that this was great movie material kept hitting the lone brain cell.Sure, it would be a chick flick. Think of a better version of Bridget Jones' Diary...poker's version of BJD.Isabel's poker table gets invaded by a mysterious american, at the same time her business gets new competition in the guise of a ruthless businessman called Stryker McCabe.And to add to it all, David ,Isabel's business partner is just not interested in fulfilling her grand infatuation.As well as Isabel and Stryker, there are a colourful array of support characters. Definitely worth the read."
2,Stupid but not horrible but pretty bad.,"This is one of those slapstick try to be funny but is far from it anime series. The series is missing a plot and the characters are not interesting. The only thing worth watching is the fight scenes witch are pretty well done. The artwork is purposly bad at times and the character talk to the camera and complain about how badly they are being drawn. Its just really stupid, and I cant see how any one could find humor in it."
4,Almost Perfect,"Although I never expect anything to be perfect this side of heaven, this cutter comes pretty close. I've had this thing for about 6 years and it is fabulous. It is beefy, heavy-duty, and takes the abuse a family of six dishes out. One complaint, somehow the screw got loosened. I must have lost a washer or something somewhere along the way. I constantly have to reassemble it now. I routinely tighten the nut now and keep it snug. It still works great! Best cutter for the money!"
5,3x5 U.S. Flag by Valley Forge,Very nice flag! Its a well made product at a very good price! Very brilliant colors with shiny embroidered stars. I have had good luck with Valley Forge flags in the past and think they offer a good product at a reasonable price! It looks great on my flag pole and proud to fly it!
3,Product sent was not product pictured,"The product was sent within two days, but was not the ""Koralex II"" flag pictured online. Be careful. Amazon did a great job with the return policy though. Just a waste of a few days in the process."
2,The album is not worth the money.,"I bought this album for ""Ol Kris Kringle."" I could have saved my money if I just downloaded this one song."
2,Problematic Kindle version,"The book was poorly converted to Kindle. The text is fuzzy and looks much worst than other Kindle books. The difference in price between the printed book and the Kindle version is so small that only if you need the book NOW, buy the Kindle version. Otherwise, order the original printed one."
3,Perfectly good for a capsule,I can't tell any difference between this brand and the others I've used in the past. However I do realize that I don't prefer to get this in capsule form since it comes in small coated tablet form from other brands. I can swallow 2 small tablets with the same effort and water needed to just swallow one of these. Just my preference.
1,Constantly Needs Reset,"I used this router for 18 months and during that time, I probably had to reset it every two days on average. At first I thought it was my ISP but after they ran new lines to the house, the problem continued. I installed the latest firmware but it did not alleviate the problem.Fed up, I just trashed it and purchased a Belkin N+. Aside from being a breeze to setup and very fast, it hasn't required a reset yet so I'm very satisfied."
1,Terrible firmware,"I've had this thing about 6 months now and it has been nothing but trouble. The MIMO radio is acceptible, but almost useless now that the thing is crashing every 5 minutes. I used to have a static IP connection that would only require me to reset about once a week (no reboot button or off switch, only a factory reset button), but since moving to a dynamic ppoe login, I'm lucky if I get 15 minutes before having to unplug and plug it back in. I'm switching back to my linksys 10mb 802.11b router until I can find something new."
2,Problem loading website,"Since I got this router, I have problem trying to load up some webpages, yet they run just fine when I simply hook up my cable modem to the PC without routing it through this router. There could be something to do with the router's own firewall, but I don't see any options allowing me to control it. Anyone got any ideas?"
2,Doesn't Support Multiple Connections,"Product looks nice and works well with a single connection. It will not support multiple connections, it just won't."
1,Do not buy Netgear WNR834M,"Actually, I don't think I will buy Netgear at all. This is the problem: I bought the Netgear WNR834M and a netgear wireless card for my home PC. I also connect with a laptop. It connected just fine ... but every 5 to 30 minutes it just stops connecting (the router). Cycling power on the router brings it back on line for another 5-30 minutes.This was a brand new product, yes I'm going to go search the web for more recent firmware updates and play with security settings and make that phone call to India support... BUT *YOU* don't have to. Buy D-Link instead. I'm generalizing this beyond my particular product because the same thing happened at work. We got another Netgear router, it intermittently disconnected too. Our solution was to rip it out and stick in D-Link. Life is much better. At home, I will try to salvage my ""investment"" ... but save yourself the grief."
2,OK While it lasted,"Worked great for two years, then started dropping connections, had to be rebooted every half hour etc...I wasted a few days trying to fix it, and now it's in the garbage."
4,Wear it with pride!,"The Kitchenaid close combat bludgeoning tool is a leap forward in personal protection technology sure to satisfy the most discriminating of afficionados of home and self defence. With sharp aesthetics and exquisite performance it is a truly welcome addition to any medium sized arsenal. It has good balance and response with minimal recoil, and by way of its ergonomic design it can easily fit under a belt or in a shoulder holster (not included). Versatility, it appears, is the approach that Kitchenaid chose in the design of the tool; with little or no practice even a relative novice can easily master all of its functions. A particularly useful feature is the capability to open bottle caps of standard issue size. In short, this tool is an option worthy of consideration for anyone on the lookout for a compact, yet effective tool requiring a minimum of training to operate effectively."
1,Big and bulky,"Wanted a nice bottle opener for the boys who always use a kitchen onto get them something that works better. Although this does, it is kinda ridiculous to have a heavy heavy opener that looks like I'm trying to hard. I should've bought the prettier one that is smaller."
5,OPENING LINES,"My opening lines are: this is one efficient bottle opener.We'd been looking for a bottle opener that would look good on our bar - not any of those ""cutsey"" openers that don't really work or are supposed to be ""conversation pieces.""We are, of course, familiar with other KitchenAid products, and so sent for this. It's perfect, and can pop a cap quicker and more easily than any opener we've ever seen."
5,Awesome bottle opener...,"This is a great bottle opener....strong, sturdy, and only $3.96 everyday at Walmart. It'd do you good to pick it up there, rather than spend nearly $10 here."
5,A Brute,"Don't you hate cheap bottle openers? Those that bend or are too small to lever properly? Well, here's the opposite. You'll break the bottle before even stressing this thing. Nicely styled and fits comfortably in the hand. A one-trick pony but it does it well.About the only negative things:1) people with small hands might find it too big (thus, most guys will really appreciate it's heft);2) If you drop it on your bare foot, it's gonna hurt."
5,Great,"Came fast, in great condition and at a unbelievably low price! I'm over joyed :) I'd recommend you buy from them."
1,Not very good,That's the problem with comedy--either it makes you laugh or it doesn't. The latter applies in this case. Waste of time and money.
4,All Time Christmas Album,"A nice collection of a variety of Christmas music. Much is available separately, but it is nice to have it on one CD."
2,Not quite ultimate,I was expecting something fresher from these great artists instead it felt tiredDoubt if I play it againAny elevator need music!
2,"Not ""Ultimate"" for sure.","I purchased this CD for about $5. Disc one was like being at church on any regular day. I did not hear much classical Christmas music, but lots of choir music. And, the first song was such a disappointment. I really loved this song and the rendition of it was just too mellow with one sorrowful voice and no instrumental backup. Disc two was better with more of the classics being played the way I remembered. My only favorite was the March from the Nutcracker Ballet performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Both discs were quite boring and very down beat for the most part. I was not inspired to bake cookies, shop for presents nor decorate. I did get myself a shot of Jack Daniels, though."
4,"Pretty good, though maybe not 'ultimate'","If you love Christmas as much as I do, you will probably enjoy this album. It features plenty of standard favorites - especially sung by the MoTab, who seem to be a holiday staple. I probably wouldn't pay $17.95 just to hear songs like 'The Little Drummer Boy' of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas.'What makes this compillation interesting is the liberal sprinkling of less traditional - or, anyway, less well-known - classical pieces. Vivaldi's 'Gloria', Corelli's 'Christmas Concerto', and the opera 'Hansel and Gretel' all make an appearance. The standout, in my mind, is the ethereally beautiful 'Watt's Cradle Hymn,' which I have never seen or heard anywhere else - that one song alone makes this album worth a listen."
3,"Not ultimate, but truly classical","Good mix of the expected (""Silent Night"", ""O Come All Ye Faithful"", etc) and the unexpected (the Vivaldi Gloria, Gabrieli, Schutz). Kudos to the Sony team for uniform clarity & quality of sound, despite source material from 1959 through 1998. Word to the wise: the performance of ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" credited to Marilyn Horne is actually by Eileen Farrell from her excellent ""Carols for Christmas Eve"" release. No disrespect to Ms Horne, who is well represented by two performances with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. If you're truly a classical music fan but don't mind a traditional carol or two, this is an excellent buy."
5,Better than film!,"The 16MB SmartMedia card is perfect for digital cameras (I use one with my Olympus D360-L) or similar applications. It holds about 74 high quality images. Also, most people don't realize how small these cards actually are - they're about the size of a mini post-it note and weigh about as much as a nickel. I think the only disadvantage is the possibility of losing it!I would recommend using a higher capacity card for MP3 players - you won't fit too many songs in 16MB (probably 3 or 4)."
2,Too Small and Too Expensive!,"While the card worked fine functionally, it is simply too small to use in a normal environment. When I use it in my digital camera it only gives me a few ""good"" quality pictures. The card only holds a few songs in my MP3 player, too.Anyone considering this card should look at other options before purchasing it. Take a look at the 32MB and 64MB cards.P.S. The price from Viking on equivalent products are better. Take a look at (SSFDC3/16, SSFDC3/32, SSFDC3/64)."
5,A good buy!,I use this cards for my Olympus digital camera. They're reliable and haven't failed to me a single time. Thay have a very good price and you can use them with other SmartMedia devices. Really good.
3,Not that great,I gave it a three for two reasons the first reason i took off a point was because it took me about 35 minutes to get the memory card out of its package. You better hope you have good scissors and if you die expect to spend a good 10minutes tryin to get it out. The second reason a took off a point is because i bought it for my mp3player which is 32megs. With this memory card you get to add 4 songs. and that's 4 short songs... if you can only add 4 songs onto your player...it seems like a rip-off but if the 64mg is too much for you buy this one and get poor quality songs and you can fit more than 4.
4,Life Like pet,"I bought this as a gift for my wife's niece. It resembles a Chihuahua fairly well considering it's price and the fact that it is a stuffed animal.Her niece is almost 2, and seemed to really like it. She kept hugging and kissing it, you couldn't get it away from her the entire day.The dog seems to have some kind of wiring or something going on inside to help keep it's shape, which it does well.If you or someone you know like plush animals, especially Chihuahua's, you would enjoy this."
5,Very cute and soft!,"I ordered this, and within 3 or 4 days it came! It came exactly on the estimated delivery date. It is very soft and huggable. And realistic. And POSEABLE! It fits dog clothes too! If you have, or know a child who can't have a pet or just wants a toy, you should get this! I HIGHLY recommend."
2,Magnify the Product Picture Before Purchase,I purchased this Item for My Girlfriend. We are currently stationed overseas and she misses her dog. I compared this Item to her dog and figured i was on the right track. Its not Lifelike at all. Its durable but not at all like the Picture at all.
4,Awesome action packed humor!!,"Man this title threw me off. I thought it was going to be a bit like Shadow skills, but it was way better than that. The humor reminded me of a mix 'tween Maze and Those who Hunt Elves. The characters are awesomely funny! Of course my fave is the father but hey they're all great. Definately picking up Vol 2!!"
4,A partial viewing of this Anime had me in stitches,I saw part of this film at an anime special showing of parts of series'. My friends and I were very impressed with the way the story was portrayed with both humor and great action sequences.
1,Trivial,"The book is extremely trivial and doesn't give you in-depth & thoroughly coverage of any of its topics. A lot of material is monotonous & repetitive and the author doesn't provide comprehensive clarification of some distinctive and important terms...In general, this book is completely waste of time and money..."
2,Distributed Applications With Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 McSd,"Like all other MS certificate prep books, it is not enough for the test. May be useful as reference book. It give you only the outline of the Visual C++ distribution application with no indepth instruction. The worst thing for novice is that it will frustrate yourself if you fail the test. However, most of my friend who passed the test told me it is definitely not enough for the test. You have to read some thing else. Like prep or cram book. This is another example bill earn him money by .? .. people."
4,Good book for passing test.,This book did it's job. I passed the test no problem. I would not recommend for newbies but I would also not recommend an MCSD certification for newbies either. (Go get some more experience first the world has enough paper tigers)
1,Dangerous,"I bought this book for the peaceCENTER, which is the local organizer for the Million Mom March for gun safety. Not trusting my own reaction, I passed the book around our core group of peace educators. The bullet is adorable, and therein lies the rub. If I were a young child, I would want to find a gun RIGHT NOW so I could play with the cute little bullet and look down the barrel to take a peek into her wonderful gun house. Towards the end of the book, the stray bullet is pregnant with a baby bullet. The illustrations are beautiful and the author's sincerity was never doubted, but the intended age level is in no way sophisticated enough to understand that Ms. Bullet is an attractive nuisance and not a potential playmate. For those looking for a good gun education book for young children, I would recommend Guns Are Not For Fun, which we also bought through Amazon, not nearly as pretty but delivering an unambiguous gun safety message."
1,??,"This book came up in a related items search as I was looking for a book for my young nephew. After reading the first review, I googled the author and came upon her twitter....and..... INAPPROPRIATE doesnt even come close. I don't know if I even believe this womens bio now. If you came across this book the same way I did, keep looking for something else. I only rated it with one star because you cant enter the review without rating the item. Otherwise I wouldnt have rated it at all. The End."
2,Ok but died after 5 months,Overall a decent ball and very soft to the touch. However after about 5 months of gentle indoors playing (maybe 1-2 times a week) the ball started going flat within a day.
3,It's soft and easy to float but not good for developing controlled shots.,"I bought this ball because it was the most I was willing to spend on a volleyball at the time. 2 Years later and it's pretty much lost it's capacity to stay inflated. This ball is nice and soft for girls or a co-ed league but it's very hard to develop controlled shots (i.e. roll shots, cuts,...). This ball likes to float when hit and reduces it's velocity on hits. I'd recommended the higher quality gold version. It's $15-$20 more but very much worth it."
1,Unbalanced,I ordered one of these balls and it would bounce off in all directions when I tried to spin it back to myself. It would come off the hand and arms funny when you try to serve or receive it. I had Amazon replace it and the same thing with the 2nd ball so I had to return that one too! (And I don't like to return things either.) I was always a huge Tachikara fan before but very disappointed with this one. I wonder what's going on??
4,Great ball!,"This ball is quite a bit cheaper than the Tachikara SV5W GOLD ball. What you get is a very good ball. I find the feel of the ball just right. If you're playing in co-ed or in junior, I would recommend considering the GOLD because it has a slightly softer contact. It's only a small difference but if soft contact matters to your players, they'll notice it."
4,Great ball if.....,"Best indoor ball out there if it holds air. I've bought many of these, but about one in six looses air after a few months."
5,Joy To the World- CD,The Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs favorite Christmas carols beautifully. Really adds to the spirit of the season.
3,"BEST DISC IN 5 DISC SET, 10 MOVIE SET","Kungfu zombie- I was able to read the subtitles for about 50% overall of this movie. I swear that is in this movie too. Unfortunately, the picture quality is poor, but still VERY watchable, but even if it was better quality, this movie would still recieive a 4/5. That being said, this movie is a unique find, and well worth watching for fu fans. THE ENDING IS INSANE, not up there with return of master killer final scene, but INSANE. Very cool movie.Fistful of Talons-I have too agree with the other reviewer on this one exactly, but i do have to say that BILLY CHONG IS FREAKING AWESOME, he is right up there with alexander lo rei for me, but not in the class of Phillip Ko, Chen Shan, or Hwang Jang Lee. Everthing else I would agree with the past reviewer on this one."
1,voice direct continuous express 4.0,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANYONE. I HAVE HAD IT FOR 3 MONTHS AND AM STILL TYPING AS I TALK BECAUSE I CAN NOT GET THIS SOFWARE TO UNDERSTAND MY VOICE. I AM SHURE THERE IS MANY OTHER VOICE SOFTWARES OUT THERE THAT ARE A LOT EASIER TO WORK. I AM RATING THIS A BIG 1.
4,Where's the eye remover?,Very nice peeler except it's missing a feature that every other peeler I've ever seen has; a protuberance that can be used to remove the eyes from potatoes.
3,good quality but a lil uncomfortable,"The product is of good quality no doubt, but the grip is a lil uncomfortable for me, thats all.I wish the handle were a little slim.."
2,Great start....bad finish,"I was very happy with this Kitchen Aid peeler for about a year. All of a sudden, it has gone dull on me and I'll have to buy a new peeler, but not a Kitchen Aid. This is the second Kitchen Aid product I have been disappointed with. The first was the expensive hand-held can opener that I returned and replaced with a Progressive model that I love. I am giving up on the Kitchen Aid small items (but love my dishwasher!) This time I'll try the OXO peeler. It gets rave reviews and has a replaceable blade."
4,"Fun stuff, the kids love these!","We love these Silly Songs! I wish there were a more comprehensive set without any duplicates, but we have enjoyed these DVDs. The kids like them, and we like having something clean and entertaining to pop in, especially for shorter periods of time."
5,You'll Love It!,The music and videos are funny and well done. I've been accused of buying this for myself and not my daughter. That may be true. We find ourselves singing these songs together and making up our own words.We love it.
4,Entertaining for kids and their parents,I heard my husband laughing as he was watching this DVD with my one and a half year old son. Both enjoy it!
5,Awesome Collection!! :),When I first saw that they had a complete collection of Silly Songs like this I had to buy it...I am such a kid at heart and love all of the songs! My family owns quite a few of the veggietales movies and some of the cds. Everytime I babysit I bring this collection for the kid loves watching it over and over again...and of course I love watching it also! It is a great collection and I hope everyone likes it just as much as I do! :) The Jukebox DVD is awesome...I find it fun to pick what songs to play and in what order! :)
2,Good Video's however not Closed Captioned!,"This video is good, however it is not closed captioned, they forgot to take care of the hearing impaired, way to go!!!I will never support this company again!!!!"
2,"Products shipped were ""Free Sample Packs""","The advertised ""Jet Print Photo Professional Photo Paper (15 Count)"" is not what BuyWTG shipped. For each order of photo papers, BuyWTG shipped me 3 ""Free Sample Packs"" that each contain 5 Sheets. Although a 3-sample-pack substitute still adds up to a total of 15 sheets, these Free Sample Packs were not packaged in a hard protective box for retail sales (presumably to save money because they were FREE) and as a results some of the sample packs had crushed, wrinkled, or otherwise damaged corners.Although BuyWTG shipped me replacement packs for the ones that had visible corner damage, once the packs were opened I noticed that many of them have occasional bends and indentation marks. The flimsy soft cellophane covered packaing in which these free samples were packed is simply not adequate for covering damage that could result during shipping and handling, or from placement of weight on them."
4,great paper,"This paper was perfect for the cd work I had to do, definetly worth the relatively inexpensive cost."
5,CLASSY!!!,"I was looking for a watch which could be used in any ocassion and this one is perfect, good brand, classy style, sporty look, strong band and bezel. Besides, the bezel color is different of the rest of watches so you will have something really exclusive at this price. In two words : GOOD DEAL!"
4,Every bit as good as advertised,The day before we went on a family trip I decided we needed a good digital camera (I had it shipped to the hotel where we were staying).This camera is every bit as good as advertised. The quickstart and battery life of the camera are phenomenal. The fit and finish of the camera are top notch.Using the QV-R51 we've been able to take some brilliant pictures we've framed and hung on the wall or emailed to friends and family.I held out on the last star only because I'm reserving the 5th star for the camera that has all the QV-R51's features but with the additional ability to take multiple shots per second.
3,A digital camera that lasted less than half a year,"I bought this dig camera when there was no customers reviews, so i basically risked it. Well, my consequence is that I have to send it back to the Casio Company for repair. I bought it in March, 2004 and now tons of lines appeared on the screen for i don't know what reasons. They said maybe I drop it, it went through some scanning problem, or just there are some problems with it! v.v ... Other THAn that.. this dig cam is pretty good .. but I don't know what the say.. not only half a year yet~ The pictures are pretty nice, great functions, it would be better if this 5 mp dig has sound for the video mode. Hopefully the problems will be fixed or else I guess risking is baD."
3,movie with no sound,"The casio qrv-r51 take wonderful still pictures. I really love the 2 inch screen. The movies look perfect. I rated it a three because the movies have ""no sound""! No where in the description does it say ""no sound"". This is the 21st century. You do not expect to make a movie with ""no sound"". The owners manual talk about transfering audio files. How do you do that if there is ""no sound"". Beware the company will not take back or even exchange for a higher priced camera. I love the still pictures. I hate not having ""sound"". I will purchase another camera. ""Not a Casio""."
4,Ornament: oh yeah.,"Modernism never managed to kill off ornament completely, but it did cause massive trauma to the historical vocabularies of architecture. Trilling, like many, likes historical ornament, and has written this here book to talk about why ornament has for the most part gone the way of the dodo. I read the intro, skimmed the first half, and read the second half.He focuses on analyzing the various theories and writers, along with exploring some of the pyschological reasons modernism jettisoned ornament. All in all, I found it interesting and pretty good, but thats probably because I am interested in this very specific topic. This book is probably for architectural historians and students only, though anyone interested in the history of design might find it interesting."
3,not embodyment,"Eventhough this CD is well written and performed, it's just not Embodyment quality. If you start with Embrace the Eternal and listen al the way through the afore mentioned title, you will find that the band has changed dramatically. This CD lacks the intensity and creativity of past Embodyment records. Sean's vocals are still great,and the band still has a knack for creativity, but it just seems like something is missing from the whole package. When I heard Embodyment was coming out with a new CD, I was so excited and couldn't wait to hear it, but when I finally got it, I was very disappointed."
4,Feel the power!,"I simply cannot agree with the previous reviewer. This recording is another excellent entry in the cycle of symphonies by Maestro Tilson Thomas and the SFSO.The first symphony is undoubtedly the most flogged symphony of Mahler's cycle. Every hack orchestra attempts it and most fail. there are also a myriad of recordings available. In my own collection I have the Inbal, Abbado (BPO) and Bernstein (DG) recordings as well as having heard recordings by Solti, Chailly, Kubelik and Tennstedt. Without a doubt this current version is the most dramatic performance around.MTT holds your breath at the climaxes and then lets the huge orchestral sound swamp you from all around.The recording sound is simply brilliant and fully captures the gigantic range of dynamics needed in this symphony.As you would expect from such a fine orchestra, the playing is superb and immaculate.This cycle promises to be one of the finest of the modern era. But what else do you expect from Bernstein's protege?"
5,Best Pizza Cutter I've Ever Used! I Love It!,"I never thought I'd write a review about a pizza cutter, but this one is wonderful. First of all, it looks great. I got the white one and it's a brite white! Second, the feel of it in my hand is comfortable. It has a nice weighty feel to it. You can tell it's not cheaply made. Third, it zooms through all kinds of pizza - homemade, store bought, or frozen. I also use it to cut through thick sandwiches. I'm very glad I bought this!"
1,Did not get the product,I can't honestly rate this product since I still haven't received it. It's almost been a month now and I haven't gotten it.
5,Absolutely Sublime!,"These stories touch the heart. So many times the fact that black families love and cherish one another is glaringly absent in the media. We hear all about the negative aspects of black life. Well, now we've been served up a healthy dose of positive love. Bravo! I enjoyed the stories about celebrities. But I also truly appreciated the stories about everyday people. I applaud the Stovalls."
3,ok,"The love stories in this book was pretty good love stories. My favorite stories were the one's about Colin Power,and his wife Alma, Rachel and Freddie Cook, and also the one about Barbara and Earl Graves,they seemed more like old fashion love stories than the other to me."
3,Extreme Music,"It all started , ended and began here, in all senses. Compared with this fabulous disaster of a record, the thrash bands of the Eighties were merely playing Whoops! Apocalypse with their talk of nuclear war and the bomb. Neurosis, on the other hand, acted out an end time drama that none have been able to eclipse since. Souls at Zero was where metal ate its industrial meets crustcore tail, a musical ouroubourous to match the striking cover image. Little surprise then tht Neurosis' fourth album is still regarded as the alpha and omega of extreme music"
5,Best keyboard used since the old IBM CRTs,"If you're thinking of get either this or a keyboard from M$ or IBM, don't even bother with the M$ model. This keyboard, and any Logitech keyboard for that matter, offer second to none key feedback.I have own three of these. It is great for using a computer with your TV. You can sit in a chair 15' away from your computer and play a game or watch movies. Add a M$ or Logitech opital wireless mouse and you never have to leave your couch.Anther great aspect of this keyboard is that you can two of them side-by-side and they won't interfer with each other. Each keyboard syncs to each hub offering the ability to have multiple kewyboards in close promiity.The two batteries that it comes with will last you 3-6 months of constant use. With good batteries, the keyboard will type away for years w/o need for new ones.If their is a weakness in this keyboard it is if you spill something inside, it done. You will have to buy a new one."
1,"but wheres Abe ""Fish"" Vagoda","I see everyone but Abe Vagoda...whats up with that? Something up with him and Bernice? Was he out working Narcotics with Chano? Abe made that show for me,he was the best: a seasoned older cop chock full of experience and that ""true grit"".oh wait he must of been in the toilet."
2,Not Truly OEM Fitment,"There is a reason why Walker says to replace all parts if current exhaust system is welded. It's because this muffler is not a direct replacement for the original muffler. It's 2"" shorter and the inlet and outlet are placed off-center, unlike the centered inlet and outlet on the original muffler. Not only can't you reuse a good exhaust pipe and/or tail pipe from your original system but in the future if any component of the newly replaced complete system fails you are either going to have to replace the entire system, again, or have to use another Walker component only."
2,"Overall, disappointing","Mapping the World by Heart is an excellent concept. There's not a lot in this guide, however, to help with the day to day implementation of what seems to be an overwhelming undertaking. Background information about the countries and the people is also missing; the Geography Coloring Book is much more thorough in this regard. Finally, the curriculum package (and it did feel ""packaged"") comes with a VHS - not a DVD - which I had no way to watch; the technology needs to be updated."
3,Just OK,"While this product did provide a nice list of locations, bodies of water, and features, it did not provide labeled maps - only blank ones. I've had to put in a great deal more work to make this usable for our family and homeschool group. I was definitely disappointed, but have made the best of it."
5,Really a Simple Idea,"This complete course has a ring binder, maps and a video.The video is definitely not essential to the course. It is simply an introduction by the creator, David Smith. It's kind of like a public relations tape about how phenomenal the course is.This book needs to be perused before you begin teaching so that you get an idea of what you need to do to get your students to the point of knowing the world by heart. And that will allow you to make a schedule that you can follow at a pace that will get your students to be geography wizards by the end of the school year.There are copies of the blank maps and grids included but I found it helpful to order extra copies so that if my students messed up they could start fresh. There are also student handouts so that each student should have a ring binder to keep track of them.The lessons are well laid out. I was totally amazed at how much my students had memorized by the end of the lessons. It was truly astounding!"
2,Great Idea but very lacking in teacher guidance,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed in this product. There is really very little guidance for a parent/teacher. If it is lacking in this area it just does not get taught properly. I searched online for ""Help and Teachers' Guide"" for this product and found nothing. My children were very disappointed in this as well."
4,Good explanation of male/female communication differences.,"This is a useful, interesting, provocative description of differences between men's and women's speech behaviors. Tannen takes an essentially socio-cultural stance in explaining the reasons for these differences. Not only does she present coherently her ideas, her speech is crisp and animated; thus, it is a delight to listen to her. This audio is an excellent introduction to Tannen's work on this subject. I ask students enrolled in my Gender and Communication course to listen to this edited tape in lieu of purchasing the book, as this proves to be an efficient alternative to reading the entire book. For instructors similarly inclined, I recommend purchasing two or three copies to be placed on reserve in the university library."
1,Yakk...,"First, it would be nice to explain, that this book is targeted to (a) women, (b) women suffering from the lack fo self-confidence, (c) women suffering from the lack of self-confidence and comfortable with blaming men for sexism on a working place. It's just too much time spent on sexes relations instead of real communications problems. Of course, difference of male and female styles of communication is a problem, you have to keep in mind, but this is not the ONLY problem. Reading the review on a boook I expected advice on improving my communication skills, not to hear a bunch of regular feministic stream of accusations of the business world. It's just misleading, useless and very unpleasant. So if you want feminist propaganda, this book is for you, if you really want improve your skills, go somewhere else."
4,The book by Deborah Tannen is enlightening!,"Not only I did I personally enjoy the content of this book, but I sincerely wanted my boyfriend, co-workers, and family to read it as well. Her insight is easily applied to everyday life and I appreciate her many references demonstrating her research instead of ""pop psychology.""Deborah Tannen is not only highly respected by her colleagues in linguistics and communications around the world, but respected by readers everywhere!"
5,Fusion Makes Programming Easy,"Multimedia Fusion makes programming any type of multimedia software as easy as clicking a mouse button. It is a descendant of Klik and Play, The Games Factory, and Click and Create. The program's editors allow anyone (including non-programmers like myself) to easily assemble and code software without using any complicated programming languages.Not only are there a great variety of objects available for use in your own applications, but if you do know how to use C++, you can also create your own and include them as well.The best part about MMF is that you can sell your games, applications, or projects to others without paying any royalties or fees!Two thumbs up!"
5,AWESOME,"Short and sweet. If you've every wanted to make a game or program but didn't want to learn a programing language, get MMF today! It's as fun to make a game as it is to play them!"
5,Wanna make your own game alone?Or either use MMF or...,"So, you know how to do graphics and animations (or not), you know how to do a good music (or not), and when you play a crap game, aways say things like ""i could make a game FAR better than this one, if i have the chance!"" Well, or either you have a battalion of programmers working for you, or you use MMF! The click-and-play interface powered up with tons of graphics, musics, all in a professional level who brings back the one/two persons game company to the market! Stop dreaming and start making REAL games! Be one of them, if you think you have the skill! And if you already know C++, no problem! MMF has a development kit only for programmers - you create your click routines, and can even sell them - a killing program for both amateurs and skilled programmers.... Multi Media Fusion. It's not a program, is a revealed trade secret from game companies!"
1,KHoward,"I too was excited to finally find a box that had pitch control for the dance classes I teach. First, I let my daughter use it for step practice and it skipped. I made another CD, it skipped. I tried to use it in class and unless I constantly cleaned the CD, even the new ones I just burned, the CD would skip. I guess I'll have to return it and try something else. Oh well, I was excited."
3,GLOSS FINISH GREETING CARDS,THIS WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU WERE SENDING A PHOTO CARD. BUT FOR JUST THE AVERAGE CARD IT IS TO SHINY. I WANTED TO USE THIS FOR BIRTHDAY CARDS BUT AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND PRINTING A CARD IT DIDN'T GIVE ME THE PRODUCT I WANTED. PLUS YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR EVER FOR THE INK TO DRY. BUT NOW I HAVE SOME PHOTO PAPER.
1,If Disney ran your hospital you'd be dead.,Warped Republican thinking . America IS doomed if people listen to this worthless analogy. Can't wait for the McDonalds birthing clinics to open.
5,Ready for the Update,I really enjoyed this easy to read book. Some things have changed since the original 2005 edition (sorry to state the obvious) and I think an update is in order. I found the book to be very practical and helped me to really get the difference between saying and doing the right things and feeling it.
3,Try chnging your mindset,"Lots of good stuff, and required reading for all health professionals who deal face to face with their clientele, but I fear he may be preaching to the choir.The opening chapter is disappointing - no need for Fred Lee to explain himself: he should move straight to the nitty-gritty!"
5,Been waiting for the price to come down ...,But waiting no longer. It is now on i-T-u-n-e-s for their normal price. Well worth the money for the download. It is even better than I remembered from the movie.
5,The movie is great and so is this soundtrack!!!,"I am watching ""Secretary"" right now, probably for the millionth time, and so I decided to buy the soundtrack. It's great, but don't spend a lot of $$$, I found it quite easily on shopaol.com and I only spent $19.41, and that was with the 3-6 business day shipping!!!***The ""theme"" song is superb, and I love ""Chariots Rise"", it is fabulous!!!***"
2,It's not all that...,I bought this only because it's one of the few that can hold larger marine batteries. Unfortunately it doesn't have external terminals or a circuit breaker. The lid doesn't have any sort of snap on. The only thing that holds the lid on is the crappy strap that easily broke.I would go with something else if I had to do it again.
3,The price was right,"This battery box seems pretty sturdy, and the battery charge indicator is a great way to guage the available power. My only complaint is that there aren't any access holes to bring the charging cables into the battery. Also, the straps that hold the top onto the container have to be installed and make it difficult to check the battery...a hinged top would have been a better solution.Other than that its a good bargain."
2,Moeller Power Plant Battery Box,"Frankly, I was just plain disappointed. When I got it, one lead was pulled out of the socket. I found a pin extractor and re-affixed the lead. The box has no handles; the design really is for a ""screw terminal battery"" with ability to power a 12 volt auto type socket; clearance to put in heavy cables like for a trolling motor...nada...the ""power checker"" is a joke. I just wish that the ad for the product was clearer. Given what I know now, I will replace it with one from West Marine."
2,Disappointingly stylized rather than real,"I had high hopes for this book, especially after seeing the other Amazon reviews. I was very disappointed, however, because many of the photos appear to be touched up or otherwise stylized somehow. There are many very blurry images and various double or multiple exposure shots. If all the photos were like the one on the cover - simple, real, excellent photos of horses - the book would be worth the money. However, only about 1/4 of the photos are that way. This seemed to me to be more like a rich person's coffee table book than a true horse lover's book - for those who like ""artistic"" renderings rather than the real thing."
5,"Wow. I mean, wow. Really, wow. No, wow.","Really, Michael has that gift of seeing what others don't see and capturing it in the lens. What you'll see in these images if you're open enough, is pure love. The love Michael has, obviously, for these creatures, wild, free and noble. But also you'll see these animal's love for life itself in their expressions and the briefly-captured energy of their movements. Each page suitable for framing, each page dares you to stroke it and imagine the sweat of the hides and smell the unmistakable odor of a living horse. In fact, most of the images are so beautiful, you could crop out the horses and still have raw beauty."
4,Horses: Photographs,"This book has great photos of horses running, sitting, rolling & fighting. The description was not very clear about the fact that the photos are black & white and also brown & white. There are no color photos. Large book & good price."
3,Photoshop Overkill,"There is no doubt that Michael Easton is a talented photographer, so his over-manipulation of some of the images in the book was disappointing. I'm sure he had a purpose--some emotional reaction of his own to the pictures he'd taken--and he intended to elaborate on that emotion for the viewer, but my reactions must have been significantly different from his, as much of the reworking left me confused and unhappy. Still a great collection of horse photos for the horse lover, but not what I expected."
2,"If you want ""art:""","Most of the photos are, I assume, purposely out of focus in an attempt to show motion. But if this was his goal I feel Eastman failed terribly. In my opinion it is a collection of blurry out of focus shots most of which should have been left on the darkroom floor. If you want ""art"" I guess this book is for you, but if you want photos of one of the most beautiful animals in the world look elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,I've been looking for a equine coffee table book with amazing photography. As an equestrian myself I know when I see amazing photos and this was not it for me. Probably a fine book for a non-horsey person who is just fascinated by any horse photos but if you are a horse person - this is not it and I returned the book.
2,Nice . . . if you're into digitally manipulated photography,"I have to say, this book was interesting to look at, but not what I was expecting for equine photography. In this case, the author took very basic and quite bland photos and digitally enhanced them, creating more of a work of art then an actual photograph. It is common to see pictures of white horses with darkened backgrounds, or severly blurred images that either direct you to a small focal point or have no focal point at all. All of the pictures have been changed to either black & white or sienna brown. As far as spectacular equine photography goes, I would stick to the masters, such as Gabrielle Boiselle, Robert Vavra, etc. that do it without Photoshop."
2,Good information but lacking visuals,"This book is a good compilation of Richter's work. However, the reprintg of these images are incredibly small. The writing is good but the actual images are almost postage stamp size. For the price, this book is not recommended unless you a die-hard Richter fan."
5,My non-reader loves this book - its reallly funny!!!,"This book is hysterical. All kids, and adults, will love it."
2,Not what I remembered...,"I read this as a very young child and loved it; as an adult, it's drivel. The book's series of short tales about a very stupid family are mainly an outlet for one-liners. That being said, the book should still be entertaining for very young children, and children just learning to read on their own. The pictures are fairly amusing."
4,good general purpose mug,"I bought one for keeping tea warm, and it does the job admirably; keeps tea hot even after a couple of hours (which is long enough considering it only holds 12oz, I usually finish the content before it gets below enjoyable temperature).The cap contains rubber lining to keep liquid from leaking, and it's easier to clean compare to other tumblers. I didn't give it 5 stars because the edge of the mug (where it meets the cap) gets really hot, and can give you a good shock on the lower lip if you are not prepared."
5,Well done documentary,"This was a very informative documentary. Although it was mainly about the Amish, there was also some information about the Mennonite community. As my ancestors were Hugeunots from the same area of ALsace-Lorraine as these two groups, with similar views, I found this very informative as well as refreshing. This was a very positive review of the community, so that any previous misconceptions someone may have had that may have ridiculed this group could be replaced with the reasons why they have endured for so long. We could learn from them."
5,INVENT IT PROJECT PAPER,"GREAT PRODUCT. I HAVE USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT STICKY PAPERS AND THIS ONE WHILE NOT PERFECT WAS THE BEST FOR THE MONEY. I MADE STICKIES FOR CRAFT BAGS, BE SURE TO FILL THE PAGE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN IT THROUGH YOUR PRINTER MORE THAN ONCE. ON MY FIRST SHEET I RAN IT THROUGH 3 TIMES AND BY THE THIRD TIME IT WAS PEELING OFF THE BACKING. I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN AND PLAN SEVERAL MORE PROJECTS USING IT."
4,Great music,"This album is pleasant instrumental music. 'Varja' and especially 'Wheel of dreams' are moody acoustic guitar driven pieces which wouldn't sound too out of place somewhere on an early Genesis album. Ariki (hummingbird spirit) has a tirbal rhtyhm to it. Their music is quite vivid but on this album they stay with acoustic instrumentation, though the epic album closer, Marie, has some synthesised guitar.The feeling of the album is relaxed and spiritual. There is no singing on the album. The songs, however, have some hooks. There'll be a particular riff, on piano or guitar for example, thet you hear a lot through the song, and usually the saxapone (or lyricon) does a solo. It's fine album. 9/10"
2,Oh please....,"This is why new age gets such a bad rap. This is so ponderous. If you like the music used for 1960's and 1970's educational science movies that you saw in high school then you will be pumped up for this The band has a cool sounding name but the music is very boring and lame.""Unbelievably boring and lacking any drama"" would have been a better name that appropriately desribes their sound."
3,Works ... and will give you huge forearms!,"It works, but boy does it take some effort!!! It's not too bad with diesel fuel or #2, although a bit more effort is required than I'd like. Even using it on tranny fluid will wear you out after a while. Try it on anything thicker than that & your gonna be there for a while. I've had this for just about 6 months now & there's no change from when it was new. A small amount of bleed back through the check valve on the intake side has just started as well. Probably something stuck between the check ball & it's seat - I'll have to tear it down and investigate that. Also, the way they fold the lines for shipping results in permanent kinks, which further restrict flow & add to the effort. If there was a coil of wire inside the hoses - similar to the lower radiator hoses on older cars - this would be a big plus. All in all, it does work ... just not fast .. or easy."
3,"Cool subject, but writing is elaborate and excessive.","Jack Fincher, father to the amazing feature film director David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO), wrote this book in the 70s about an infrequently talked about subject matter: left-handed people. Lefties have always been given a bad rap, but Fincher shines a light on te perceptions and realities of these folk. As a lefty, he has an insider's take on the matter, but also explores scientific takes on what makes us (I'm a lefty too) what we are.I recommend the book, but the language it is written in is too ornate and unnecessary. If David Fincher - a direct and concise talker - had written it, it might have been a little more to the point and a little more humorous. But, he makes great films, so there we are."
2,Not much original content,There isn't much original thought in this book. Most of it is just a rehashing of Martin Gardner's many wonderful books.
4,Could have been bigger and faster,The memory was a good upgrade but I did not like u having to take it out for a modem or something else. Plus it coulkd have been faster.
5,ICE is a sure way of creating business wealth.,I truly enjoyed the book ICE because of its simplicity. It has a number of excellent guiding principles through-out. I wish that more organization embrace the concept of ICE. I know they will benefit just like we have.
2,"Valley Forge Nylon United States Flag With Sewn Stripes & Embroidered Stars, measures 4 Foot x 6 Foot","Very attractive and appeared to be well made flag. Unfortunately it has lasted just 8 months. We usually get right at a year, so, I am disappointed in the durability of this flag."
4,beautiful flag,"A well made and strongly made flag with excellent coloring. After the blizzard of Feb 2013, we'll know how well it faired in high winds!"
5,Beautiful Flag,This is a quality made in the USA flag. It is on our flag pole and flies high for all to see. I highly recommend this flag to others looking for a quality made flag to fly outside.
5,Ackerman - what he does...,"William Ackerman is a delightful solo guitarist and a charming live performer, but I think he's at his best bringing out the talents of others. This album is a perfect example. Here Ackerman weaves rich and driving tapestries behind and around the ""leads"" of his co-performers. Shadowfax's Chuck Greenberg ads his soaring lyricon to Visiting to make it one of the highlights of the genre - I don't care what the Amazon reviewer says - and the album is worth it for this cut alone. But this cut isn't alone and the rest will engage you with a variety of different instruments and styles - all elevated and unified by Ackerman's artistry."
4,Soothing and calming,"I first heard William Ackerman on Cable's 'Soundscape' music channel and it immediately caught my ear. Calming, yet interesting arrangements. I love the whole cd!"
4,Great tool for big jobs,Just the right tool for those big jobs in non-stick pans! The sturdy handle is really great!
2,Doesn't work all the time,This product works well when it works. Sometimes you have to unplug it and plug it in again to get it to turn on. Otherwise it works fine.
4,Counterfeiting and gangsterism,"Steven Jory tells the tale of how he became the biggest counterfeiter in the history of England. This is a great view into the world of UK crime and the accompanying dialogue is well constructed in the language of those involved. From loan sharks to secret hideouts, this book leaves no stone unturned. The reader clearly understands this is a book about breaking the law but the effort which was put into producing a Pound note that was passable in any location was stunning. Mr. Jory successfully tells his story without making the book an ego trip and he infuses aspects of his personal life that make him seem like a very average person who just happened to stumble on to a way to make more money (literally) than he had ever imagined. I definitely recommend this book for fans of the true crime genre."
2,Elbow Protector,"I'm not totally pleased with this product. It serves the purpose of protecting my elbows while on the computer, however the elastic is a bit tight around the arms. I purchased a ""large"" and it is still very tight and uncomfortable. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless your arms are very small."
4,"Well-made, Beware of sizing","I bought this product for elbow protection due to ulnar nerve problems, not as sports protection. I found the padding to be excellent, and it fits inconspicuously under a shirt. Good protection. I'd give it 5 stars . . . however, sizing to be off on this.As another reviewer mentioned, the elastic is too tight, which can constrict the ulnar nerve in other parts of the arm it touches. I've tried stretching it out by various means, but I'm about ready to get the scissors and sew it back. If onlyl it could loosen out like a 10-year old pair of underware (a story for another review).I bought the large. I have an athletic build. I can tell you that if your arms are larger than 14"" flexed or 13"" straight, the large will be tight on you. That said,if you're arms are over that size, you're not wearing it all the time, or for injury recovery, it might be just right for you."
3,nice but too tight,"The quality is good -- nice material, good padding -- but it so tight that it is stopping my circulation. I just cut through the band with a scissors, and hope that helps. I will try the extra large brand mentioned in another review. Size large should have fit -- I am an average sized woman with an average sized elbow."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I need these badly, but upon receipt they wouldn't even fit over my hand and wrist. They are so small that they fit my 8 year old grandson, but not me! Don't waste your time and money ordering these.I have used Heelbo Heel/Elbow Protectors for years, but these are not as described!"
1,Circumference at elbow = 7 inches,"WARNING - Even Extra Large ones are VERY VERY TIGHT. I bought a LARGE one. Its inside CIRCUMFERENCE at the ELBOW is only 7 inches. The meaterial is not very stretchy either. If you wear it for any length of time, it will be very very uncomfortable and unhealthy perhaps. I rate it 1 star because it is too tight. Returns are too costly too."
3,Yes it's tight!,"As most of the reviews have stated , it's a snug fit; it leaves a red band of itchy irritation on my bicep after each use. And I don't have any kind of ""guns""...A previous pad provided by my physical therapy was nowhere near as tight and I am not a fan of the color-coded sizing of Heelbo products. Must make it easy for hospitals and the like, but they don't have to wear them in public...I managed to pull a string on one of my two pack and as an idiot (thank you), I unraveled the entire lower cuff. So I fixed the tightness problem on the forearm. Now about that bicep..."
5,French literature at its best,"If you like Victor Hugo, Emile Zola, or Gustave Flaubert, you will love George Sand. Many people have heard her name but much of her work has never been translated into English, so she is largely unread in the United States. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. The story seems fairly simple on the surface, but it has layers of meaning and truth that will strike you. The love story is very real and beautifully crafted, and the book's hero and heroine would not be out of place in the twenty-first century. I enjoyed every page of this book. You will, too! It's a must-own!"
5,"On love, life, business, and the Industrial Revolution","This short, fast paced novel, artfully translated by Kover, is as much a social commentary on life during the Industrial Revolution as it is a story of true love. The plot is engaging, the characters are convincing, and the story culminates in an inspiring twist. A pleasure to read, The Black City will surely strike a familiar chord with every entrepreneur, aspiring business owner, or anyone who has ever yearned for something more in life. I highly recommend reading it!"
5,Absolutely Great Book,"This is one of the best translations I've ever read, and it is so nice to have another of George Sand's works available in English. The story is surprisingly modern, very readable, with really appealing, human, simple characters. If you've heard of Sand but never read anything of hers, start with this book!"
4,Good for the Sand collection,"As usual Sand creates a short story mixing her interest on working class and equity values. Inside the romantic time when she wrote it, concludes that you don't need to be rich to achieve happiness. I enjoy the way she remarks several human values like kindness, generosity and detachment of things. The book came new (despite it said ""used"") and in short time."
4,Pizza Cutter,Finally we can cut pizza without a mess. Sturdy construction and a comfortable grip can't be beat.
5,A revolutionary debut.,"This disc is worth getting just for one track ""The Happy Couple"" which is one of the most beautiful, haunting tunes every written by Michael. The single plucked string against the backdrop of the low E string is nothing short of stunning. Some of the artists out there who try to impress by bombarding us with 32nd note scales could learn a few things from Mr. Hedges. Often, 'simple' is better for effect. But the term 'simple' does not fit with Michael Hedges. What's great about his music is that it is actually very complicated and difficult to play, but it doesn't sound like it would/should be.The rest of the album is a treat as well, especially ""Layover"", ""Eleven Small Roaches"", ""Baby Toes"" (oh my, a gorgeous tune), and ""Lenono"". All of these display the impecable finger-stylings of Hedges with awe-inspiring hammer-ons, pull-offs, and timing. A great debut by the master."
2,Cheap quality finger flashlights,"A quarter of them didn't work right out of the bag. The kids did love the ones that did work, while they lasted. We gave them out in the goody bags at my son's birthday party, and they were a pretty cool gift to get. The kids were excited. Many didn't last long, though."
4,Velcro Finger Flashlights,"I placed an order for 40 + to share the ease of this products with other Ushers. It stays on your finger, no dropping or forgetting your flashlight or trying to hit an exact spot with light..it really is as easy as pointing your finger!"
2,No Instruction,"This video gives a short, basic overview of DJ terminology. If you do not know the names of the different scratch and juggling techniques, this may the video for you. If you are looking to learn how to DJ, scratch, beat match, juggle, etc., then save your money. Poor production and lack of any intstruction makes this video worethless to all but complete begginers."
4,STUD EARRINGS SILVER CELTIC KNOT,THESE WERE GREAT THEY ARE VERY PRETTY AND NOT TOO BAD OF A PRICE. I WEAR THEM EVERY DAY AND THEY SEEM TO BE HOLDING UP PRETTY WELL.
4,Good Movie,Good movie to show a bible study or youth group to show you how much you are worth. It made me cry the first time I saw it.
5,A book all parents with teenage kids should read.,"This book is not only funny but very insightful. It opened several doors of communication between my sixteen year old daughter and myself. I am able to get needed information about the boy she is dating while sharing a few laughs at the same time.I have given this test to a couple of boys now, she is actually making better and more concious choices of the boys she is choosing date. She now looks at boys wandering if they would pass the test or not.I love this book and would recommend it to any parent that has a teenager in the dating scene."
4,amazing show,"Its hard to watch a single episode and not see the attention to detail the producers took to recapture the events that took place, 4 stars because not all the episodes are included"
5,50 classical highlights,"I purchased this CD for a friend who knows nothing about classical music and after reviewing it myself, knew that it was just exactly what I wanted to hear, an easy way to introduce some of the great music of the world. I hope this encourages my friend to want to expand her listening choices. Thank you."
1,"Big, Big Disappointment","I got this last year and just got around to using it. Boy, am I disappointed. The biggest flaw is that the water comes out into the tray attached to it and because this tray has holes in it, leaks onto the floor where it is sitting. I guess that might be a way to get lots of cleaner onto a spot, then move it onto plastic and suck up the water.It quits putting out the clean water before it is empty - at about 1/4 tank, which wastes cleaning solution.The only thing it does well is suck up water. Since I bought it too long ago to return, I think that is what I will use it for. I will apply the cleaning solution myself and then suck up the water to pull out the dirt.I do not recommend it and have no idea if any of these little machines work better."
4,I love using it I wish it was bigger..,"I bought this Steamvac to clean up my cats spew I found that not only did it remove the vomit but it also removed marks that I thought were wear and tear, the problem here is that because it is made for just spot cleaning that I found myself compulsively having to clean the rest of the carpet spot by spot I just couldn't stop myself. It probably deserves 5 stars but I found cleaning out the machine a bit of a drag, you got to take the lid off pour out the water pick out the bits of hair and stuff from the filter and basically leave it in a prepared state ready for the next time you use it, kind of boring especially when you could be doing something interesting like watching TV or eating."
2,"Does the job, but there has to be better","I bought one of these about a year or so ago. It does a great job with spots, but it's kind of a pain to have to schlep it into the kitchen, fill it, schlep it back to the stain, get down on all fours, and scrub (what loosens the stain up is you shoving the brush around on the carpet). Plus, this morning the hose on mine split, spilling the nasty water I'd just sucked out of the carpet. Ugh. Wouldn't you know the warranty has expired already.I'm springing for something better this time."
4,Great for small stains,"If you're looking for a lightweight machine for spot cleaning, this Steamvac Jr. can't be beat. Having one small dog (who, while housebreaking, had amazing amounts of stuff coming out of one end!) and two children whose idea of cleaning up a spill was to stare at it, hoping it would go away, there were lots of spots on my 25+ year old carpet. Renting a carpet steam cleaner and lugging it up a flight of stairs was more than this aging baby boomer wished to do. The thought of replacing carpet made me have to take a nap.The Steamvac Jr. did extremely well on stains there had been present for an extended period of time. Lightweight and easy to fill and clean, it worked like a charm. It was easy to carry up stairs and handle. As others have mentioned, a longer cord would be been useful and if you accidentally tip it, it's a bit of a disaster but overall for the money (and free shipping!) it's quite a useful item."
4,I love the Hoover Steamvac Jr,"Yes the steamvac is loud and wears on me a bit, but it is worth it. The unit os very lightweight and easy to use straight out of the box. Beware, once the dirty water starts to fill the tank - it can be a bit tippy and that is frustrating - but suck it up and be grateful you can clean the area again. The unit is small and does take a while to do bigger areas, but it is a system I can afford to keep. My thought for improvement would be to make the electrical cord diconnect from the unit so it would be easier to go dump. All in all I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Steamvac........Where is the steam ?,If you want a steam cleaner......DO NOT I repeat DO NOT buy this product. I've felt hotter water in the Arctic !!!How can a company sell an item with the name steam in it when there is no steam!!! Is this allowed ??
2,As bad as any american appliance.,"Steam release trigger is VERY inconvinient - hard to push, especially when your hands are wet. Steam pressure is very low. VERY loud."
4,Hoover Steamvac Jr.,"I have not had a need to use this yet, but I have comfort knowing it is there when I will need it."
4,Pretty Good Cleaner for the Money,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch. Like other reviewers said, this does NOT create steam, but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it ""Steamvac"").It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch. There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank, which proves that it does suction. Many small cleaners like this spray solution on, but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud, considering it is a vacuum. It is very light and easy to carry. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains. Of course, I knew this when I bought it, but it would've been a nice feature."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this item based on the mostly glowing reviews posted & was totally excited to use this for existing stains/future stains. We too are a multiple pet household. I am returning it today. As other ppl. did , I tried it on old stains-- they are still there. I tried it on some week old coffee droplets-- they are still there. I am going to stick with Resolve/Spot Shot & a little elbow grease. This machine was completely underwhelming."
2,"fine for spot cleanup, --BUT...",not recommended for more than a couple of square ft of stain area or carpet cleaning (unless you're a masochist) but works fine on small jobs.
5,Great Purchase,"This was a great purchase! It takes out stains instantly and is extremely easy to use. I had some small ink spots on my carpet and it took them out without effort. I also used this to shampoo the carpet in the car and it worked great. Others are right, it is loud, but that certainly is outweighed by how well it works."
4,Works Great,Nice compact cleaner.. the only thing I don't like is the little cover for the dirty water does not seal.. so if your tank tips.. the dirty water pours out..
3,A Cute Little Troll,"This compact machine delivers more punch than other carpet spot removing machines I've owned. It works really well on medium pile carpeting. It did a fabulous job on the traffic areas of my son's beige carpet. It doesn't do as well with dense, sculpted rugs. It also didn't do much for my heavy backed short pile area rug. I think for spots on most carpeting it will perform well. It's very small, so if space is an issue, you should be able to find a spot to store it."
3,A bit disappointed,"It sprays the water/solution welll, however, it does NOT heat the water, so the water is only as hot as what you put into it. Since it was called a ""Steamvac"" I was expecting hotter shots of steam - not just the hot water I put into it. Otherwise it is okay. The water I put into it doesn't stay hot very long either."
3,Short Lifetime,"This belt disintegrated in less than a year in the southern California sun. Looked great, fit well; but I sure expected it to last longer."
5,You are what you eat.,I have been eating these delicious energy bars since I was a bioycle racer in the mid 1970's in Alaska. They are easy to digest and supply plenty of energy between meals. The carob coating keeps them from becoming a sticky mess like other chocolate energy bars. My two teenage children enjoy them as well. My wife takes one or two to work.
2,Abdominal cramps,"The taste is good and I like the amount of protein. But, after using 2 a day for a couple weeks, I started getting abdominal cramps."
4,"Good, but get ""Permutation"" first!","Upon listening to the first three tracks, you might think this will take you on a journey, the way ""Permutation"" did. Well, it doesn't! Instead it shows you what wonders can be accomplished with a genius mind; the mind of Amon Tobin. Half way into the album, you will hear sounds you have never heard in your natural born life. This album lacks instant hooks, but at the same time is layered with single shot melodies that might make you feel as if you were in a different civilization never discovered. As for physical content, the album is bass-heavy, and the beats are not as jungled. This feels more like selected works than a whole album, because the tracks themselves are individually constructed. Compared to his other works, this is more experimental and very cold. Definitly get it, but don't, till youve heard the other two (especially Permutation)."
5,WOW,"WOW. I have never listened to Amon Tobin before. Supermodified is my first taste of this guy. I have not listened to much music, especially in this genre, so I find it hard to speculate on the originality of this album based on other artist's work. He could be copying someone for all I know-But after thoroughly listening to this album, I think that there is a pretty slim chance that, that is the case. It felt like I was being guided through the different stages of electronic metamorphosis, and in the end of these massive kicks of bass and clamour there was always a twisted, pretty, little present of a song. To keep things short: Definitely buy this album. It will fill you with warm sounds.WOW."
5,Speakerfull,"Well, it's all been said already, but this is indeed a beautiful, dense, speaker-filling album. Beats, sounds and emotional responses tiptoeing on the organic edge of electronica. Get it. Give it lots of listens."
2,Contrarian point of view.,"Okay, first of all, everyone's failed to mention one thing: This CD sounds homebrewed. There's a layer of production missing from this CD. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I've had a friend say the same thing. In addition, I've never been able to get pass the 2nd or 3rd track. The sound of the recording is just too heavy. If the production had been better, this CD would have been more listenable."
4,Hmmmmm,"well i guess i would say that i appreciate this album for its listenability. there are a lot of sounds on here that you dont ordinarily hear, and to get the full effect of them, you have to either strain your ears and mind to figure out what they are, or simply turn your stereo up a notch. i choose the latter. aside from some annoying ""vocal percussion"" sounds on one of the tracks, all the other tracks are excellent, though different than tobin's past releases. not a chill album, but a very deep and active one, with a wealth of working concepts. anybody who wishes that peace orchestra had decided to add a crazy lionel hampton on drums, and composer john williams to score the melody, will go for this album."
5,Four Ton Fun,"Usually I review an album after listening to it two or three times. I've listened to ""Supermodified"" even more than that, and I'm still having trouble conveying the intricate brilliance of this CD.This is definitely *not* traditional drum and bass music. In fact, the breakbeats are hidden under layer after layer of ambient sounds and ""noise"" (for lack of a better term). Some of the tracks feel like you're listening to them from under a swamp. You have to hear it to understand.What I really like about the CD is that Tobin has a number of ""ethnic"" samples, and a funky lounge feel to it. But then, some of the tunes (e.g. ""Golfer vrs Boxer"") are simply dark as hell. That's the beauty -- there's so much variety, but it's pulled in so tightly and expertly that it doesn't sound hashed together.If you're looking for something mind blowing, buy this album immediately."
5,Makes it no harder than it needs to be,"The best! By providing information in a concise and straight forward manner, it is possible to understand ultrasound physics. As the other reviewer stated, Edelman's seminars are superb, this is the best book out there by far. It just can't compare with his seminars."
2,Simple to the point of no learning,"At first it is appealing because of its simplist approach, but upon further reading it becomes apparent that this book tries to simplify the material to the extreme. The book suggests if you ""just"" memorize the anagrams and analogies you will pass the RDMS.... It doesn't care if you understand the principles and doesn't give you the information to understand the concepts -- just tries to give you simple examples for you to memorize. I take offense as this approach suggests sonographers are too slow to learn anything more than silly diagrams and memorization tricks."
3,Still searching for something better...,"I have used this program for two years now and find that it can do many fun things. It does have the bugs mentioned in the other reviews, but I have found that many other home design softwares have similar bugs. You can have a ""basement"" in it, but only if you designate the first floor as the basement and go from there. You can add multiple levels, but it is not intuitive and took me months to figure out how to do. My biggest gripe with this software (and all the others I have tried), is that it will not allow for attic designing. Any new floor level generates a new roof line. I am still searching for a product that will allow me to convert attic space to living space. Also, it does not allow for curved stairs. I have spent hours of fun with this product and have remodeled my home many times on screen. This software remains my favorite until I can find a product that will allow me to convert my attic."
3,Did what I needed,"With this tool I was able to create a virtual model of my home and try out different improvements, furniture, and paint colors. This program allows me to create furniture in TurboCad (a truly great program) and easily access them. The colors in the realistic image tool are accurate enough to use for trying out paint chips on walls (scan the chips in any photo software and sample them for RGB colors). Unfortunately this image tool is Painfully slow. This program handles complex roofs and half stories very poorly. Hopefully newer versions of this software have improved some of its shortcomings (V 6.0 was released in April 2001)"
5,Acoustic genius!,"Michael Hedges created a style all his own and Aerial Boundries probably defines Michael's acoustic genius best. Each song is pure and is played with the passion that only Michael could deliver. Listen to it once and no matter what type of music you normally listen to, you will be a changed person."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,I have been spoiled by CandyRat records and the sound on this CD was nothing special. I should have listened to a sample.
2,Not enough of the good stuff,"This is reported to be Michael Hedges best release. When he is playing solo guitar it is excellent. But on too many of the tracks, and most of the long ones, Hedges adds other instruments and the result is very spacey, mellow sounds that are indeed too much like elevator music. Very boring. This is a shame because Hedges obviously has more to offer. The After The Gold Rush cover is so slow and dull it begins to annoy after about 2 minutes. On other tracks, the popping percussive hits on the guitar can be sometimes a bit jarring, but after hearing them several times you get used to it. If you get this cd, plan to program your player to play only 3 or 4 tracks which are very good. Nothing bad here, but too much is boring."
2,good tune but tracks,The tunes were great but several tracks skipped. Lousy since you can not return a defective CD to Amazon you are Scr--ed.
5,An instant calm...,"I randomly borrowed a CD from a friend just to have something new to listen to, and was lucky enough to pick one by Michael Hedges. I know his work has gotten a lot of merit for its technical aspects and arrangements, but there is something more about this CD and his others. It has this hypnotic charm which always puts me at ease. I recommend this CD from the bottom of my heart to anyone. I heard that he has recently died, and I will mourn the loss of his music as much I would mourn the loss of a close and dear friend."
5,THE PINNACLE OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION...,"Of all the albums Michael Hedges has released, this has to be the best overall. I own and love all of his albums, but this is his magnum opus in my opinion. Not one bad thing can be said about it. When I listen to a song like ""Aerial Boundaries"" I know that Michael was connecting to a higher power, whatever that was to him. Nothing has ever sounded so pure and divine. His music communicates on so many levels you feel drained after listening to it, much like watching a great movie like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan.He will be sorely missed."
3,Cuts the pizza but handle is a problem,"This cuts the pizza great. One pass and the pizza is cut. It is sharp and the roller blade moves easily. The cover is great and the color is pretty.My only complaint is the same that I have with all of my Kitchenaid utensils: The handle is too big and the cutter is a little heavy. It fits in the hand and gives you something solid to hold on to while cutting but it is sometimes awkward to use quickly with all of the weight being in the handle.Also, it is difficult to fit into my tool turn around with all of the other utensils and they all take up too much room in the drawer together. I also have a pampered chef pizza cutter that is lighter with a much smaller handle that is easier to use. It is not necessary for this utensil to be so big.But like I said this cuts the pizza cleanly so if you do not care about the size of the handle or the heaviness of the utensil, this does the job."
1,unhappy,"I was thrilled when I received this as a gift. I was learning to play the piano, this seemed to have everything I needed. I put the software in my computer and hooked up the cable to my computer and keyboard. Was unable to get the program to work. tried contacting the company no results. Went on line to see if I could obtain any help, no luck. Went and had the cable checked found defect in cable, purchased new cable... Hooked the new cable. Still unable to get the program to work. Is there anyone out there who can get this program to work?"
5,Definitely not overkill! I bought two!,"Even for a 3.34 megapixel point-and-shoot digital camera (e.g. Nikon 990), this 96MB card isn't overkill, considering when each image is about 1MB at 2048x1536 at highest JPEG quality. Uncompressed TIFF files are 9MB _each_, although they're painfully slow to save. So, I bought two, and I'm thinking about getting a third one for longer trips."
1,OVERKILL,"The item was absolutely positively wonderful, except for onehorrid flaw, its tooooooooooo darn big, i went on vacation and tookpictures every time i got a chance for an entire month, WITHOUT changing the card, and when i got home i still had 25 megs left over, i easily got 500 super-high res shots out of it and four times that in normal quality. its just a waste unless your pre-occupied with size(hmm sounds familiar)"
3,"better than it's predecessor, Empire of Ice","This time Moran focuses on the states. There is some pretty unbelievable science in this book, such as their plan to divert the Gulf Stream (though i don't know, maybe it could be done)We have a different enemy in this edition, mainly Argentina and the S. Hemisphere countries, who have risen in power since the crippling of agriculture in the northern hemisphere. good book."
2,The Formula,"Barely two stars. I've never seen anyone rip off their own book so badly. I'm a sucker for disaster books, so I was willing to look past the bad Hollywood action film formula that formed the foundation for the previous book. Earth Winter, however, followed the formula of the previous book so closely that I could not even begin to forgive. The cycles of the character's relationships, military-political intrigues, and science heroics were all exactly the same as the previous book. My impression is that he rewrote the previous book paragraph by paragraph in an attempt to retain the same feeling as the previous book."
3,A fast good read but I wanted more!,"I like the first book in the series : Empire of ice. It set up the story nicely even if there are not a lot of characters. There is the hansome, rugged multi-millionaire who dress up casual and has a simple lifestyle. Where are those guys in real life? I guess they are so rare so they deserve to save the world :)Anyway, I read every disaster book I can get my hands on. This book wasn't the best but was able to get me interested enough to finish it. If you read the first one and like it, you will not be disapointed with this one because it is a perfect continuity. The enemy has changed but it always a question of power and money.Is it ever about anything else.I would have like to have more written about how the people were living the situation in the north. If you want that, read The sixth winter."
3,Nice for crafty types,"Filled with lots of craft ideas, the WonderUnder Handmade Gifts collection is a great book for crafty people who don't like much sewing and want to get projects done quickly."
4,Lots of Fun Ideas,"This hardbound book is full of great and fun projects, well presented, complete with patterns and new ways of using Wonder Under. What did we do before Wonder Under? Recommend +++"
3,not what I thought it was,"Be careful when you order this product. It is great for what it says it's for, but I was thinking it was just a matte finish paper. It is a thin light weight paper and is the same thing that photography expert uses for proofs. But if you use this product you will still waste the ink, bacause you can't use it as a photo."
3,Not all hits,A great trip down memory lane. I just thought every song was going to be a hit from the title's time frame. There are some songs I never heard of from Artists that are strangers to me. I guess this is because I could not figure out how to see all the songs listed on the cd's from the advertisement online.
5,Good but not great,"I guess many songs I like are not classified as Soul, such as Last Dance. I guess that is classified as disco. A lot songs that that are good, but not enough of the great songs I was looking for."
5,Soul Hits of the 70's,"I chose a five star rating because the tape had such good sound clarity. I find that soul music from the 70's still bring back happy memories. If you enjoyed soul tunes from the 70's, you will love this tape."
2,a miss for me,Not what I was looking for I wanted more had to buy seperatwly spinners delfonics and stylistics chi-lites and others
2,Not very good,"I understand and appreciate the fact that this movie is supposed to be cheesy, but OMG this is a terrible movie!"
5,International Horror Film Festival Hit!,"We saw this movie at the International Horror Film Festival. This is not a ""slasher"" type movie, but more the old Grindhouse style with an entertaining story which made it a lot of fun to watch. For those of you not familar, like the style of the Michael Jackson Video ""Thriller"". The main characters, Darrel and Sadie, were likable and Darrel was very funny. I am sure we will be seeing more from both of these actors in the future!"
4,20 years and still going,"After 20 years this CD still stands up. Still a good listen. Still a good example of all it wanted to be, the integration of synths and accoustic in a kind of music that gets the best of both. If its weaknesses have become more apparent with time, so have its strengths. And Mark has moved on to other things (why should he do more of the same thing?). But Vapor Drawings is still there for us to enjoy. It has outlived the stigma of New Age. (And now you can get it cheap. So if you've been holding out all these years, now's the time.)"
4,Tasty Instrumentals!,"As you probably know, Mark Isham is in demand in Hollywood as a film composer. This early solo effort is notable by its minimalistic approach. So many composers throw lots of notes on the pallette - Mark uses notes & colors sparingly, and still produces a strong statement. Of particular interest on this album is his use of trumpet. Even though it's his major instrument, he chooses to use it primarily as a background instrument in many of the tracks. He also does a number of interesting things to it electronically via tape loops, overdubbing, etc - but still with taste. This is one of my favorite Isham album. And after 15+ years, it still sounds new!"
2,Just good for one song,"""On the Thresh hold of liberty"" is a very dramatic song that has been commonly used in movies and tv. The rest of the cd is a snooze fest!"
2,Modern setting detracts,I found the transition to more modern time and the set distracting. I also found the renditions of Regimental Rata-plan uninspired. I compare with Dame Sutherland's performance and memories of Beverly Sills' Wolftrap rendition.
5,Loved it.,"The heroine had us laughing and also has a gorgeous voice. The hero was magnificent as a singer and drop dead handsome. Altogether a delightful, charming, and beautiful performance."
5,Best version,"I regard this version as superior to the one with Ciofi because Dessay is in fact a better singer than Ciofi. Florez needs no introduction since he is the reigning light lyric tenor today. Some complain that his voice has a ""nasal"" quality but in fact that is simply one of its unique identifying features. Most very great singers had uncommon voices, perhaps even ones with a few ""defects"", that served to make them unique. Callas for example, and Melchior. There are lots of voices with nothing distinctive about them, but Florez is not in that group, fortunately. No praise is too high for his art or his unique vocal instrument."
2,Frenetic to the point of ugliness,"After reading all these reviews I too am in the minority. I have seen about 130 operas but must admit this is not in my top 100. To be fair to the opera I should probably watch it again. First the sets were horrible and Eurotrash like. I found Natalie's frenetic behavior annoying...cuteness to the point of ugliness. And I found the entire score unmemorable. I wish I had the Sill's performance to compare it to. I just did not enjoy the opera comedy. I always pictured Jeanette MacDonald in this role, someone with a little more elegance who could win the adoration of an entire regiment. Lucille Ball on uppers is just not fun in an opera. But I will give it another try. She must have really bothered me since Florez did not stand out in this opera like he has in so many others I own."
3,Vision vs art,"I've never watched this opera and the DVD gave me the opportunity to see Dessay-Florez in action. His is a unique voice perhaps suited to comic opera [Okay, now I'll duck], but having enjoyed his performance in ""Le Comte Ory"" [Met HD LIVE], I wanted to see this. Being aware that the setting was, for want of a better word, fastforwarded to early 19th century, this did not detract too much, but the overabundance of movement did. Dessay really was like a wound-up doll [goodness, she even had the looks of one, sorry!] unwinding at frenetic pace. My husband was asking, what's with the modern iron and board?Two lovely singers with worthy instruments that might have been better applied by another director."
5,Second greatest opera after Barber of Seville.,Natlie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez are a perfect singing pair. And who wouldn't like JDF hitting 5 high Cs?
2,Not the Best DVD,"I saw a tape of another production of ""Daughter of the Regiment"" and it was fantastic. The DVD I received from Amamzon was different, although the cast was the same. The quality of the film was poor, the lighting was bad, and there was a different conductor. All in all, it did not have the same electricity as the first production that I saw."
4,La Fille du Regiment,"A superb performance, but the alleged subtitles -- both the English and the Spanish -- are abominable. There are ridiculously few, and most of them give the beginning of a sentence and then do not finish it. The singing is excellent as is the acting. Juan Diego Florez is the new Caruso, and Natalie Dessay is not only a superb singer, but acts the part of La Fille most charmingly. The others in the cast are all splendid as well."
5,"""La Fille"" a delight for the eyes and the ears","Marvelous singing, fun to watch, wonderful acting and great comic timing by Natalie Dessay, 9 high Cs by Juan Diego Florez. If you want to buy only one bel canto opera buffa, get this one."
2,Surprised people like this book,"I am so surprised people like this book. I was expecting whole entries from her newspaper columns with maybe some editorial here and there. This book is nothing but a bunch of editorial with snippets of her columns (and I'm not sure that I would ever consider them the ""best of""). I found a gem here or there but am SO disappointed in this book. I love to read about Eleanor Roosevelt and was looking forward to reading HER words, HER thoughts, and this was far from a book of that. SO disappointed. I have rarely rated a book so low. The only reason I keep reading is to see if I can find those ""gems"". If you're looking for Mrs. Roosevelt, in her own words, don't waste your time or money on this book."
2,Compare realistically with other speakers before buying.,"Well I did just want to buy a Soundman X2 for my new PC. I did base my choice on this Amazon product reviews which was overwhelmingly with an average of 5 stars, but I was dissmayed by the actual product regarding performance. I finally did compare it with Yamaha Power Cube ACS 45 and the performance is much further better: specifically it's bass and volume is better. I'm not promoting any brand here, I just want the consumers to try and compare it first with other products before buying this Soundman X2."
3,"Great quality, weak subwoofer","I've had these speakers for five months now. The sound quality is awesome. The only drawback is the weak subwoofer. Bass is very low and lacks the punch Cambridge and Altec Lansing speakers provide. But if you are searching for great audio quality without the need for overwhelming bass, these speakers will do you no wrong."
5,great sound for music,"After listening mp3 music with soundman x2, I am amazed by the sound reproduction quality from such compact speakers under $100. Very realistic. Much better than most multimedia speakers that produce only loud noise that lacks definition. I highly recommend soundman x2 to music lovers!"
4,Convenient for Quick Jobs,"Although it can by no means compared to my Wind Tunnel for thoroughly cleaning the house, it helps to maintain my floor in between those big cleaning sessions. I have 2 cats and a toddler, and this is very convenient to get out because it's lightweight and cordless. It works on my wood, tile and area rugs, but not too effective on the plush carpet. It does an ok job of picking up cat hair, kitty litter, and lints. I do wish that it's stronger because sometimes it won't pick up immdiately and just push things around, but emptying out the dirt cup usually improves things. I am always amazed at the amount it sucked up in the dirt cup. However, it is a real pain to empty out the dirt cup. Usually the dust go flying all over the place, and it's somewhat messy and difficult not to spill some. Overall it's a nice little gadget well worth the money, but there's definitely room for improvement."
3,Hoover S2211-100 Cordless Vacuum,"Nice idea (cordless, light weight, bagless), but here are a few gotchas:(1) The roller brush jams up with hair, rug fibers, etc. It is easy to remove the gunk, but sometimes you need to take the entire head apart and remove stuff with pliers. In some cases, the plastic bushings for the roller shaft are actually damaged (melted). Which leads to...(2) There are no significant repair parts available online from Hoover. You will need the brush assembly and plastic bushings at some point in time. The batteries will eventually die (will not hold a charge after 12-18 months). You can take the vacuum to a Hoover repair center, but it would be nice to be able to order the parts directly."
2,OK for what it is.,"Has the power and life I expected from a rechargeable (enough to do quick cleanup on small kitchen floor). There are a couple of design flaws that will make me look elsewhere when it's time to replace this one. It's very difficult to get the broom on the charger so that it makes a connection. Also, when you don't line it up just right you can force the adapter plug out of the base which means you have to unscrew the entire mount and reposition the plug in the base. My mother in law has the Eureka which is just as good and has a much better charging setup. I get that on next time."
4,Pet owners - you must have this!!,"I purhcased this as a christmas gift for my father to do quick clean ups during the week. We have a dog who constantly leaves dog snack crumbs all over. My father is unable to pick up heavy things, and was always worried that he would trip over the regular vaccum cord and hose. This vaccum is so great - I use it! We have a canister vac that works good - most of the house is hardwood floors or tile. The first time I ran this on the rug - you would not believe how much stuff was picked up !! This vaccum works just as well on the hardwood too. Now I only get the ""big"" vaccum out one every two weeks to do ceiling fans, walls, and other places the hose comes in handy.Don't judge this vaccum by the picture - because in real life it looks dinky too - but it certainly is not."
4,Quick & Easy Cleaning,"This cordless vac enables me to do quick and easy clean-up jobs. Although suction is not as strong as a larger vac (naturally) it does a good job on both hard surfaces and carpet. I especially like using it on stairs and under furniture, where it fits into low spaces."
1,Lasted only a few months of light use.,"As the title says, it started to fail after only a few months of occasional use on hardwood and linoleum floors as a secondary vacuum. The tiny wheels jammed and fell out. It didn't have much sucking power either."
1,Disappointing,"I had this cordless stick-vac only a few months before it completely broke down. A flimsy, unreliable product. Even when it worked, it's weak power and sieve-like filtration were a bad joke."
1,Weak,"I was so disappointed when it arrived. We have a black and decker hand vac that is so much more powerful than this one. It picks up better than this Hoover! I am in the process of sending it back. I will probably purchase a Dirt Devil. We had one for 6 years before it broke. It worked great! I wanted to try the Hoover because it's cordless, but I'd much rather deal with a cord than not be able to pick things up. The vacuum is also built too close to the ground. If you run over things like beads or popcorn, it will just push them out of the way. You have to lift the vacuum over it to pick them up."
4,Good buy; met expectations,"I purchased this vac with the need of in-between weekly ""big"" clean ups. This vac does the trick. The head of the cleaner is kind of small, so if you are cleaning large wood floors (like myself) it can take longer than a broom, but the vac is so light, I really don't mind. All in all, would highly recommend."
4,"Good for quick clean ups, of light dirt.","I've only used this product once, but I can tell I'll be using it in place of a swifter sweeper. My dogs shed alot, and a single swifter isn't enough to pick up all the hair. This electric broom works well at picking large amounts of hair from both hardwood floors and carpet. It's bag isn't big enough, nor does it have enough power to be a replacment for a regular vacuum, but that isn't what it was built for. It's very light, and strong enough to use for quick pickups of dog hair and other light dirt in between more involved cleaning."
4,"Bleach: uncut box set: season 4, part 1 - the bount",The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.
3,fillers suck,usally good show but man do these bounts episodes kill the show for a while only watch these episodes if are like a hard core of bleach. other else you will be bored out of your mind
4,"Love Bleach, but not crazy about the Bount arc","The Bleach anime series is full of rich story lines, well-developed characters, and beautiful art. Most of what makes it wonderful, though, is the original material from manga author Tite Kubo. Seasons 4 and 5 of the anime, though, were filler material on which Kubo only had some design influence. If you're not already a fan, I recommend watching a couple of these episodes on a streaming service before purchasing the DVDs to see how you feel about the Bount characters and overall feel of the story. Some people really like it, but I personally lost interest in the arc about halfway through. I found it not as engaging as Kubo's original storyline. If you're not a big fan of this story arc, you could skip straight past Season 5 without missing much (except for the introduction of the three new mod souls, who are also anime-only content)."
2,Skip It,"I wanted to like it, but it falls short of what I've enjoyed in the episodes before the ""Bount"" There are a few parts I felt were important to over all story. My advice if your a fan of ""bleach"" skip this chapter, or rent it."
1,"Bleach Uncut Box Set: Season 4, Part 1 - The Bount (DVD)","Do not purchase used from GoHastings! I ordered both parts, 1 & 2. Both was marked ""Condition: Used - Very Good"". They were beat up, in terrible Condition, the cases were scratched and torn. We COLLECT anime, we buy used because most anime collectors also take care of their collections. And when something is marked ""Condition: Used - Very Good"" I expect it to be in that condition, not POOR/BAD. I wouldn't have paid more than 2$ for this mess that was shipped to me. In a Plastic sleeve! No protection from damage during shipment, just luck and a thin plastic bag! I am very upset by this. I cannot afford to replace it either, this was a wasted amazon gift card! Which is ALL I got for the holidays! Thanks GoHastings for ruining my only gift!"
2,almost,"The box set would be solid... if i didn't get two copies of the the third disc, instead of a copy of the 4th disc."
3,You may as well skip this part.,"Season 4 of Bleach contains a story arc featuring a new group of enemies called Bounts. They are something akin to vampires. This season offers a few episodes to conclude the previous story, but the rest is unrelated. The Bounts are not very cool. Most of them have really stupid powers, and aren't interesting characters. I had this part when it came out. I later decided to get rid of it to free up movie space on my ever shrinking wall. If you must have all of Bleach to be able to sleep at night go ahead and get it. IF you don't want to be bored and get discouraged with this series, then skip this season. When they were releasing Bleach on DVD I bought each individual release. It was really annoying. This boring story arc took nearly 2 years to release. Many people were turned off of this amazing series just b/c season 4 was so bad. If you want to see quality Bleach do not watch season 4. You can pick right up at the season 6 and not feel like you missed anything."
2,Bleach Box set....one disk?,Apparently this 'box' set will have just one disk according to amazons info. At least that's what it says when i wrote this. How is a season going to fit on one disc? Why are they charging 44.99 for only a couple of episodes? I hope the info is wrong because this is unjust.
4,An Illusion of Prosperity,Sometimes getting ahead in life is a little bit more than just how much money you can make. Creating True Prosperity is a careful blend of being balanced in one's life and truly experiencing happiness. In this book a philosophy is revealed that helps you gauge and understand why you may not be truly happy even if you currently are earning a decent income. Shakti strikes out and rattles a persons fundamental values and shows us how society has created its own self delusional citizens. She has a very pleasant way of writing that is easy to follow and extremely logical. This is simply another must read for anyone concerned with their personal improvement and betterment of their soul.
3,"Gob -"" FU Ep","With their third released disc these Canadian punk rockers have captured the essence of acts such as Green Day and Sum 41. Unlike most of the present day pop punk bands whose songs run together, each song off the ""FU E.P."" has been highly individualized, and the combined vocal styling of Tom and Theo, round out each song as its own. From the lead off track ""Ming Tran"" to the closer ""Soda"" this is an all around solid album from an almost unknown band, and they just may break before this wave of pop punk passes us by. At only 9 songs lasting for about 25 minutes, you're probably thinking ""Hell, I'll just download it"". This CD is well worth the money, selling for around $8 and containing a few extra incentives to buy (some live footage I believe). Even if punk isn't your thing, give Gob a chance; they may give your perception a shot in the arm.(...)"
4,A good story that should be read by baseball lovers.,"This book was a good book for people who enjoy baseball. This book is about a young pitcher named Schoolboy Johnson who has a good fastball but no changeup. The veteran Speedy Mason is trying to help Schoolboy Johnson develop a changeup and to calm down his temper. Schoolboy's control also was not that great. In a game against the Giants he got beaned in the helmet and had to go to the hospital. In the hospital, he thought about everything that had happened. When he returned,he pitched well. Overall, this is a good book for people age:12 and up who enjoy baseball."
5,The case of the horrified heirs,"Erle stanley gardener is a master at weaving a web of suspense around his readers. Like all the other Perry Mason books, this one too, holds your interest till the last pages. It is very difficult to guess at the identity of the murderer in his books, which of course contributes to the fun."
3,The case of the missing page,"This is the first Perry Mason novel I have read. I was not dissappointed.However ... page 14 has mysteriously vanished! On the overleaf of page 13appears page 87! The book has no page 14, but two page 87s.Where is Perry when you need him?"
3,Cheap Muzak,"I got this album because I love classic piano songs that make me relax and unwind from a hard day. This album had a little bit of that. It was mostly piano, drums, horns and keyboards. The kind of music I would hear in a grocery store. I know he did his best but he could've left out the drums, horns and keyboards and jsut stuck with the piano. It would've sounded so much better and the music would've been more relaxing. This is cheap muzak not relaxing piano. Do not buy this album"
1,Easy to use,I found using the flowchart in Word easier than this. I wound up getting Visio as it worked much better.
5,no more drooping gutters,"My long gutters had drooped in a few areas for a few years. Trying to re-drive the nail in only worked until the next heavy rainfall. These screws work as claimed and do an excellent job, I wish I had found these years earlier."
5,A Great Addition to Any Wall,"I got of shipment of flags in about two weeks ago and now have the Bennington flag hanging upon my wall. It is an attractive and emotive icon of which I am proud to display. It celebrates the year 1776 and the Declaration of Independence. Specifically, it commemorates the Battle of Bennington wherein an American force of 2,000 militiamen under the leadership of General John Stark defeated a hodgepodge collection of 1,200 British troops. You can see that its blue canton is quite large and features 13 unique seven point stars. It is believed that this banner was made for the 1824 visit of General Lafayette or for the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Regardless of when it was crafted it definitely is a classic."
2,Sizing issue,"I bought an extra large as recommended by my doctor, but it was way too small. I am not a large man and a competetors size large worked much better. This product does not come in an XXL and I had to cut it to wear and could not exchange it. Was very disappointed. I would not recommend for any man's size."
2,Not sure what these are good for,"I got these to help with a problem I'm having with my elbow. We watch movies in bed on a laptop every night and I was propping myself up on it and also doing homework leaning on it a lot. (Bursitis??) I wore it at night a few times. It doesn't help. The only thing that helps is completely staying OFF that elbow. And yeah, they run hecka small. I have super skinny lady arms/small bones and these green ones are snug."
1,Circumference at elbow = 7 inches,"Inside CIRCUMFERENCE ( NOT diameter ) at elbow is 7 inches. I bought the largest one ( Xlarge ones). They are VERY VERY TIGHT on my 10 inch circumference elbow. The meaterial is not very stretchy either. If you wear it for any length of time, it will be very very uncomfortable and unhealthy perhaps. I rate it 1 star because it is too tight. Returns are too costly too."
2,not sized right,way too small for an extra large--has plenty of pad -- can be more painful than helpful to wear. my arms are not that large
5,great for arthritis pain,I have rheumatoid arthritis and have used these for a long time. This is my second set of these. I wore out the first set after several years.
1,Incorrect size - beware,"It's the third time I order this product and every single time the item is the wrong size.I got the medium one first, which I couldn't even fit on my arm (and I don't have large arms).I then returned it and got the large, which was also very tight.Finally I ordered the XXL, which is still tight.Wouldn't recommend product unless you have arms the diameter of a broom stick. Waste of time.Also the padding inside, is not that great. Silicone gel would be much better.1 star, because after ordering an item 3 times and not being able to use it, one gets annoyed that the description of the product doesn't reflect what you're buying."
3,Bango Bolt with 1/8in pipe,"This will not work with the Dodge cummins engine, wrong pitch on the 12mm thred"
5,What a Glorious Feeling,"While I was walking down the street,I decided to take a look at the books.And seen Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable's romantic picture which's taken from the classical hollywood movie 'Gone With The Wind'.Without stopping,I've decided to buy it.When I came home,I started to read the whole book.It was perfect.As I want to be a part of Hollywood,I learn new things from this book about classics.From my personal star Gene Kelly to Bette Davis all the stars are in this book.I recommend it to everyone.Just open the book,and you'll be a part of it then understand the glorious feeling!"
5,SanDisk with USB - smooth with digital cameras,I got the USB ImageMate and I am impressed. Installation was easy - I was downloading pictures within five minutes. I had used the serial connection to download from the camera and was dismayed by the slowness. I just downloaded about three megabytes of pix in 15 seconds. Drag and drop - poof! Done.
1,Easy Installation-Not,"I consider myself technically savy but installing this piece of hardware has been a nightmare. I have had this for a week and it is still not up and running. As another reviewer has already noted the drivers seem to cause a ""fatal exception error"" in Windows 98. You have to dig through the Read Me file to find out that you must stop nearly all processes in the task bar to even install the software. Once that hurdle was overcome my computer still did not recognize the device. At the guidance of tech support I am learning all about the Device Manager settings, getting to go into BIOS and play with ECP+EPP, match IO port numbers between BIOS and the Device Manager and so much more. And it still is not working. If this does not sound like fun to you don't buy this product. And did I mention you have to wait 1/2 hour to get through to tech support even at 6am in the morning???????"
3,"Does the job, problems only minor","I needed this device in order to reformat and test a CF card that had gone bad. It works (but I really did need a new card).After reading about other reviewers' installation problems I was dreading what I'd face, but the problems I had weren't that serious. I didn't have to upgrade Windows (I have early 98). Right after installation the printer wouldn't respond, but selecting first a different printer, then the original one again, cured that. The drivers sound a tone (beep-boop or boop-beep) when the card is inserted or removed; if I start up the computer without a card inserted, sometimes the system gets neurotic and cries (continuous bee-ee-ee-ee-eep) until I insert a card as a ""pacifier"". Other than that, it works fine -- just like having one more disk drive."
1,San Disk Inage Mate,I returned it was not the correct item My error I am sure the product was good if it was correct
5,Theology and life application are not incompatible.,"I could not put this book down when I started reading it. It adds so much color at how I view the world after reading this book. Somehow, my view of God is richer, I appreciate everything around me with new eyes, as I see the hand of God in everything around me.Philip Ryken is articulate and at the same time, his views are theology sound. He elevates God in the eyes of the reader, and helps you appreciate God more, and be aware of Him in your daily living.If you are a Christian, this is such a great book to read to grow in your walk with God."
2,Very good,The book is in great shape just it was the wrong edition that i thought that i had ordered the 3rd edition and the 2nd edition was the one that i received and i cannot use it for my class.
1,When Will Computer Hacks Learn How to Write!?,"After giving up on Robert Slade's incomprehensible ""Guide to Computer Viruses,"" I was hoping for a better read on the subject with his new tome. No such luck. Slade is an amateur writer in every sense, and his sticky fingerprints (i.e., poorly constructed sentences and self-serving essays) are all over this wood pulp. The three authors (yeah, Slade must've realized that he couldn't hack out another alone) couldn't decide whether to target this how-to manual for would-be hackers toward the novice or the pro. They wanted it both ways and, in the process, manage to offend both audiences with their dense technical ramblings interwoven with condescending explanations for the grade-schoolers. YAWN! Skip this one, my friends. For a much more informative -- and practical -- look at viruses, worms, etc., check out Roger Grimes' ""Malicious Mobile Code."""
3,High Level Overview,"How you tend to rate a book often depends on what you are looking to get out of it. For my purposes, this book leans a bit too much toward the high-level end of the spectrum. For example, the discussions on how viruses and anti-virus software solutions work is presented from the 10000 foot level. Much of the content seems to focus on the management/policy making end of the problem space rather than the technical point of view. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but as a techie, it just wasn't what I was after.Oddly enough, the author rates Roger Grimes' Mailicious Mobile Code as a mediocre to poor reference on the subject of computer malware. Even though Grimes' book is Microsoft-centric, I consider it a far better reference from a technical standpoint."
4,"Excellent, good-looking product","This is a good-sized litter box (my cat's a fairly large Tom and he's willing to get in there) and it looks good enough to put in a more public place. Cleaning is easy because the drawer slides out, and the rake stores handily in the back.I'm not too fond of the disposable plastic liners--they're bulky and expensive. But you can clean and reuse them a few times, and it keeps the drawer from getting nasty, so I guess it's not that bad."
3,DVD Quality,I got a DVD from this seller. I was attracted to the price. When I got my DVD... it was in a Blockbuster Box. The DVD was in good condition but why on earth would you sell someone Blockbuster's copy of a movie? That is all I have to say
2,If only airlines where really this way...,"After watchin the trailor to this movie, i really wanted to watch it, so i did and the first time i wathed this movie, i didnt think it was that good. But i wanted to watch it again, so i did, that was when i realised that the movie wasnt that bad. although this is the type of movie you would watch when you're up for a laugh, it is a good movie, with good lines that will crack you up.The movie is simply about a poor guy who out of luck gets a lot of money and opens his own airline. The movie will fly you though how he spent his money. The movie shows you what goes on with in the guys airline.If only all airlines where that fun!!"
1,I couldn't stay through the whole movie....,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Stupid jokes, lame performances and poorly cast. The scenes with the couple trying to get into the ""Mile High Club"" were appallingly dreadful. Please destroy this movie before it does any further harm to the movie industry."
3,Whateva,"People can say what they want to say about this movie, but to me, it was funny. Sometimes dry jokes are FUNNY jokes. Yes, the movie was stereotypical, but it was in a funny way. If you just want to sit down and have a laugh; go ahead and check out the movie. Its definately NOT an Emmy winning movie, and it doesn't have to be. It's all about fun, joking, laughing and having a good time."
1,THE Worst Movie Ever Made!,"And that's a generous assessment. I'm anything but sheltered, but my jaw dropped watching this unmitigated filth. It is the very definition of vulgarity, mean-spiritedness, and nasty-mindedness. ""Soul Plane"" makes Jerry Springer appear high-brow in comparison. What a ghastly symbol of a culture that is not only in decline, but in absolute free-fall.Avoid this bubonic ""comedy"" at all costs. ""Airplane"" -- yes! ""Soul Plane"" -- no, a thousand times, no!"
1,Horrible,"Soul Plane is an unfunny movie that insults African Americans and Arab Americans. A waste of time, energy and money."
3,Juvenile Humor At it's Best!,"In the spirit of Airplane! and Airplane II: The Sequel, I say welcome Soul Plane!Sure the plot is lame and the characters all share one thing in common, uber-stereotypes, but hey... it's funnier than heck.Finally a role that showcased Tom Arnold's talent (Uhm, I meant lack thereof)I've recommended this flick to a wide range of people and not one of them has said, ""well that was a waste of time!"" most have passed on this little comedy gem to others to share the juvenile humor.The only downside I saw to the cast was snoop dog. He needs to stay behind the scenes and not be let in front of the camera.Hey, if I had the chance, I'd fly N.W.A."
1,Soul Plane (R-Rated),Well I never recieved this movie but I know it wont show like the good stuff like for badwords it will cut them off.
1,MY GOD THIS MOVIE IS BAAAAAD!!!,"This is by the far the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen in my life!!! It's tasteless, classless and offensive. It also portrays African-Americans in a very negative way and I'm surprised to see the number of positive reviews it did receive. How this movie ever made it to the big screen I'll never know."
2,not too bad,"i was lucky (i guess) to see this movie way before it comes out,it was ok it started out real funny but then it gets slow and old.go see it if you like these kind of movies, i do but this one was not all that!it starts that a guy goes to an airplane and [he] gets stuck in a toilet seat his dog dies in the plane i wont tell you how.then he gets 100 million dollars and starts his own airline.then theres a back story when he sees a girl he dated on the flight and so on."
1,How sad,"This is low, way too low. I remember watching this in Iraq with the rest of my unit. This movie made my skin crawl and was aggravating me. This was supposed to be a comedy and all it did was piss me off. I remember trying to laugh but my consciousness would not let me get away with it. I can't wait till this negative portrayl of black culture and the complete idiots who support this garbage crawls underneath a rock and disappear forever."
1,Disgusting,"I am a black woman and I have to say this is the most offensive crap I've ever seen in my life I didn't even see all of the movie I couldn't sit through it too many bad words and no intelligence dumb, dumb , bumb what a waste of film! The movie is not just humiliating to black people but to white people and practically everyone in the human race, the writer and director should be ashamed of this filth. Don't waste your time or your money on a film that is not even good enough for your garbage. FILTHY!!!!"
3,The SOUL PLANE Film Ride!,"Yeah, I know this film has a rep for being one of the worst films ever made & is considered by many to be highly offensive,... but, I really don't care. I thought it was the funniest, stupid movie I've probably ever seen! The fact that it's so panned universaly actually may have added to it's humor quotient as far as I'm concerned. A great cast of people, many of whom would probably not ever want to have this film brought up in conversation again, make it an even more joyous film viewing experience. Comedians Kevin Hart, D.L.Hughley,Mo'Nique, Geofrey, Loni Love,Tom Arnold,.. a whole host of hotties,.. and Snoop Dogg as the ghetto-fab, smoke tokin' pilot. Total stupidity & fun for all! In real life, wouldn't go near an airline situation like that knowingly,... but as a DVD film entertainment,... repeat rides on this flight many times over! ""Big, Stupid, FUN!!!""Soul Plane (Unrated Mile High Edition)"
1,Trash,"This movie is trash. If you want comedy buy FDTV, Chris Rock, Chappelle Show or Richard Pryor DVDs."
2,Why was this movie made!?!,"I would just like to ask the people who actually LIKED this movie to name five reasons in their head why. Finished yet...how about now? Well if you cant now then you will be thinking all day. I know it cant be because of the annoying Tom Arnold(Thanks Roseanne, sighs). Is it because of the music? Nope? What about Snoop Dogs laughable attemp at saying the most curse words in a one minute interval? I will admit that the movie may have gotten a few chuckles out of me, but I'm clueless to why it did. The security ladies carried the movie and they werent ever major characters! And theres the kid we all dislike who turns out to be a music director. Sighs, again.Really people, why was this movie made? I would be glad if anyone could answer me that, seriously. There is major stereotyping in this movie, such as: All African Americans enjoy rap music and that all Texans wear cowboy hats. Where have all the good movies gone, Amereica!"
1,Tom Arnold AND Snoop Dogg in the same movie? Pinch me....,"The year is 2004 and black people are still getting involved in projects like this? Amazing! This filmed minstrel show, aimed directly at white teenagers who want to act ""cool"", is astoundingly offensive to any black person with a brain and pride.Snoop Dogg takes a break from making his porno films long enough to ""star"" in this tribute to ignorance. He does drugs, objectifies women and acts like all the other black rapper/losers you've seen on MTV a million times. Tom Arnold is also in this mess, doing his ""Stupid White Guy"" routine while the godawful rap soundtrack pumps away in the background. There are also other shameful, tasteless performances by black actors/actresses who should know better. Why anyone should waste their $$ watching this drivel is beyond me.If you are a white kid between the ages of 14 to 21, wear your baseball cap on backwards, dress like a homeless clown and end every sentence with ""yo"", then this film is for you."
3,Soul Swope,"With all its faults, cliches, weak satire,and lack of social commentary, this film is, in spirit,the closest thing to an updated version of the late sixtiesflick ""Putney Swope"" I have seen in 35 years."
1,Appallingly Ridiculous - Absolutely the Pitts!!!!,"Quite frankly, this was embarrassing to watch. While one would expect a ""black"" version of Airplane this nowhere hit the mark at all so that instead of being an over-the-top fun parody, like Airplane, it ended up reinforcing the same old sterotypes in the most stale manner possible. The writing was horrible and except for scant moments with Monique and the incomparable John Witherspoon (and incidentally both these fine comedians deserved INIFINITELY better than this!) the movie was PROFOUNDLY beat-up!"
5,Soul Plane,This movie is so funny - my fiance and I have been quoting it since we saw it. Great fun!
1,DO MANKIND A FAVOUR AND DESTROY A FEW COPIES OF 'SOUL PLANE',"It is difficult to describe just how awful 'Soul Plane' is. This racist abomination is worse than ""Catwoman"" and even ""the Turkish Star Wars"" (look it up). Never before have I seen such a poor excuse for a film. When I think of the millions of years of human development that preceded the making of this movie I want to weep. I feel dirty for having watched this trash. NEVER RENT, BUY OR EVEN STEAL THIS MOVIE. 'Soul Plane' will destroy your mind if you watch it. I bet Snoop's Girls Gone Wild videos have more artistic merit.THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER COMMITTED TO FILM - AVOID ""SOUL PLANE"" LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1,A Minstrel Show!,"I guess people have forgotten their history and what African American actors and actresses still have to go through in Hollywood what typecasting and stereotypes that harken back to the ""black faced"" minstrel shows of old. I found this movie Soul Plane to be insulting to put it mildly and no I am not some liberal white guy who has a black girlfriend or anything like that. I am black man who found this movie highly offensive but I think anyone in their right mind with even a ounce of intelligence would find this movie a bit hard to watch. It's taken us a long time just to prove that we can be every bit as capable and intelligent as anybody else especially in the movie industry and now we have garbage like Bringin'Down Da House and this movie. Reinforcing the common stereotypes of oversexed, amoral, and ignorant black folks who are also racists of course. And these are the stereotypes we want to pass on to another generation? Skip this movie and read a book."
2,PLEASE CRASH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There were a couple of funny parts in this movie,but it still sucked! I hope there's a sequel inthe near future(NOT!) Have a bucket of crispy, andsome watermellon handy, when you watch this garbage!"
1,One of the Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen,"I'm not a harsh movie critic, but I had to give this movie the lowest rating. The movie was dull and very predictable. I don't see how the movie will make any real money since many high-profile comedians were cast to establish credibility with the public. I was disappointed with all the cussing from comedians who had very successful movies and sitcoms in the past that didn't require F*** you, and N*gger in every other sentence. Snoop Dog still hasn't found his niche (maybe he never will). He did well as a rapper, but seems to think he can act now. When the credits started rolling, I thanked God. The only good thing about the ending of the movie was that the movie was over."
1,Souless,"Soul Plane. I can't say it's a great movie. It's really a bad movie that I found mildly amusing. I only purchased this because I got it used for 2.50 from the record exchange. This was one of those movies that I got because we made fun it of it for being one of the worst ideas for a movie. There was something from the trailer that I kept repeating to my friends, so when I saw it at the store at a cheap price I had to snag it.It was something that may appeal to teenagers more then someone older then 22. Normal teenage American Pie stoneresque movie, I can't say I've outgrown those types of movies. I loved Superbad, however watching this was painful and uninteresting."
1,not well made,These diapers are constructed of thin material. It's easy to poke a hole in it just putting them on. They do not fit well and leak easily. The elastic around the legs is very weak. I do not recommend.
2,"Bag fine, but not what description said.","The bag (just one) seems fine. The product description said it was a 3-pack, but we only got one bag."
3,Check the size,Check the size on these. They where actually too small for my central vacuum even though Hoover claimed they were what I needed. I had to modify my installation to make them work.
4,"Pretty standard, easy to use","I use these for my Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum. They're pretty standard/easy to replace. I've been told they're a little small for vacuum cleaner bag, but I've had no problems."
3,Good Dust Eliminator,"I find these bags to be very good in getting the tiny dust particles. Yes, I do find the bags in general to be on the pricy side especially since I have had several rip. At any rate, I have not had a problem with putting the bags on or taking them off. I vaccuumed up something accidentally and needed to remove the bag to get it out. As I attempted to carefully remove the bag (one I had just changed), it ripped right off of the cardboard ring and I had to replace the entire bag. As for the big ""Poof"" when changing bags, I try to be careful and haven't really had a problem."
3,So...where can these be purchased in a b&m?,"I've had no success in finding the ""Y"" bags in stores. Anyone know where they are? Please share. Thanks."
1,WAY OVERPRICED ITEM,Absolutely RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED ... get a grip! Whoever would buy this item at this price and the extraordinary OVERPRICED SHIPPING doesn't know how to shop!
3,Not Quite What I Expected,Although this is the official Hoover replacement bag it is not the same as the nice cloth one that came with the vacuum cleaner I bought. This one is paper and still leaks dust like all paper ones do even despite the 99.9% allergen filter rating. The cloth bag was much better than any paper bags and I am still trying to find cloth bags. This product is ok but not what I hoped I was ordering.
5,Excellent Bags,I have a Hoover 6200 Wind Tunnel. These bags were the right price and available without running to 5 stores to find them. Thanks!
2,Leaky bags,These bags are somewhat difficult to replace. Takes a few minutes of wiggling and pushing. This also prevents the sticky tab for sealing the bag from sticking to the opening.
4,great product,"Have the vacuum for 1-month, works great. Not sure about the filter bag yet, but hope it does the same."
5,Galaxian is an excellent Atari 2600 classic,"This version of Galaxian for the Atari 2600 is an excellent port of the late 70s/early 80s-era arcade shooter. All of the enemy fighters look quite nice, as does your spaceship/laser cannon, there is relatively little flicker present for a 2600 game, and the sound effects are crisp and enjoyable. Control is also good, and while you can only shoot one shot at a time, one can learn quickly how to time those shots to increase the attack rate. I also found the cycling color effect during the title screen to be a lovely little touch. If you can find this game mint in box, then there is even an amusing Atari Force comic book that comes with it. Galaxian is a great game that I recommend to anyone who collects and plays Atari titles."
1,HIRT'S TINEKE RUBBER TREE PLANT,THE PLANT DID NOT LAST 2 WEEKS THE PLANT DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE MUCH SMALLER THE LEAVES KEPT FALLING OFF WILL NOT ORDER THIS PLANT AGAIN A WASTE OF MONEY
5,Pure Music Making!,"One of the highlights of the entire Praga Richter Edition is definitely this set which includes sublimely beautiful renditions of Sonata no.27 & 28 and the towering performance of Hammerklavier. They are all relatively well recorded in stereo sound between 60s and 80s. Richter's love for Beethoven's late works is evident, listeners are transported immediately into the cathedral-like serenity and reverence for the pure music making."
3,"Going, going, gone","The book is very informative. However, it is dated and the prices need to be-updated. It is a great reference book for theearly collector."
2,not good,"I would not call this book a value guide!This more like a coffee table book than somethingto be used to put prices on items.Very limited amount of items,its more like the authortook pictures(nice pictures with good color)of his owncollection.Not to be used if you are looking to put valueon items you are looking to sell"
4,Gas Station Value Guide book,For all you old gas pump and sign enthusiatics this book is a real deal. If you are wanting to price and look up things that you just can't find this book will help. If you go to flea markets to sell your wares this also assists you in knowing how to price your items and justify that you are in line with their value.
5,Hugh never ceases to amaze...,Hot Chicken is terrific. Preparing Hugh's recipes and enjoying the mouthwatering flavors and textures is a true culinary experience! Teri's photos are beautiful and creative. His tips for advance preparation make this perfect for entertaining. Hugh never ceases to amaze...
3,Almost got it perfect.,"The M Flyer is a great piece of hardware. Unfortunately it falls short just a little bit for my needs. There should be a cover for the retracted portion of the drive. I am in the Army, and I get into a lot of dirt and debri. I have had to clean it several times before I could use it. Yes, I know what you are thinking; Why is he bringing it into dirty areas. My job requires me to go from the office to the outside quite often. A optional hard case for the M Flyer would be great, and would go over well with people who are in situation like me. We want to protect our investments."
2,Bad luck maybe,Maybe its just bad luck but I had two of these usb drives and both failed in some way. The first one I had I was unable to delete or add any new data. So I returned it and got another one. After a month of use the drive would only function at 1.1 usb speeds. I tried it in different computers but still the same problem. So I'm done with this drive and will move onto a different brand.
4,I like the product but alas no rebate coupon as promised,I use this memory stick to store photos so they can be stored on a non-volatile medium. Its very nice and easy.
5,Great Deal/Wonderful product,"This solved a major need I had for an easy xfer mechanism between some of my peers at work. Works well, as advertised, and the capless design is wonderful.Heartily recommended."
1,Not this one!,I really tried hard to make a go of this software but I kept running into problems. If the design is not a basic one problems soon creep in. There are also other issues such as it is not possible to cut and paste? Most of all I was frustrated because the software kept on crashing (I have a high spec pc). This is not the one to buy!
2,User friendly? Nope!,"I tried to use this software over the course of a couple of months, but found it to be way too frustrating. Drawing the walls is time consuming and tedious. I would prefer a drag and drop interface for setting the basic layout. Setting camera view for walkthroughs is a royal pain in the posterior and camera movement is likewise difficult. I cannot rate the photo quality graphics as I did not have a quality graphics card at the time I owned this software. If you want a professional level program, you would be wise to look elsewhere. If you want a program to play around with, there are more user-friendly programs out there...."
2,Better than the average B-Movie...,"All in all, a solid B-horror movie, with both its good points and bad.BAD: The boss' son is too whiny, and you'll want to punch JR Bourne's character Carter, who does a passable imitation of the predictable horror movie ""panicky guy"" (think back to Bill Paxton's character Hudson in Aliens and his ""Game over, man!"" complaining, and you'll have a pretty good idea). Also, the blood is really lame - more of a slime than a liquid. Given that there is an abundance of blood in the movie, this got annoying.In its defense, however, the acting was good, as was the music and photography - none of which were distractingly bad. I certainly woudl differ with those who only gave it one star, and was tempted to give it three stars, actually, for what it was - never claiming to be a blockbuster. It is what it is, and you'll get what you pay for...IF you rent instead of buying."
2,LumberJacks + Enviromentalists = Bad Zombie Movie!,Here we go again another average zombie movie that just does not deliver. It has average to below average acting and the effects are ok just not great. the plot really did nothing for me eithier. You have coporate lumberjacks at odds against the enviromentalists. The virus is spread through trees that ooz some sort of red goo that comes from the trees. When there split open and splash onto its victim it turns them into some sort of zombie. Well as you can see there really reaching to develop some sort of zombie flick here. It just offers nothing new and really goes nowhere after that. Its not the worst I have seen but it sure does nothing for the whole Zombie line of films. I guess you could rent this one but even then you might not want to. I would just skip this one.
1,Severed from the Genre,"I Bought this purely on basis of the Cover and the producers. I had high expectations of a very good supernatural storyline scare.I really did expect a lot of Eeerie style White Noise Spookiness, and House of the Dead Freaky FX, but I got a Zombie Slasher, not that I would mind that if it was combined with the surreal element that the producers named had me expecting, but it is a waste. I never thought I would get to see bio-engineered Zombies, not without at least SOME spooky elements, but this was a waste. A good Touchstone for a Waste of time. Show to the Kiddies for a laugh, its not going to scare them."
3,"It's good, but not great","Well I saw th is one unexpectedly and bought it out of impulse. Let me tell you a little bit about the story:A logging corporation create this serum that makes trees grow at a rapid rate. A guy is chopping this tree and has an accident, so he cuts himself and his blood is exposed with the serum on the tree, and he becomes infected. The infected run wild and infect others.The movie was not boring, it kept me interested. The only disappointement was that a lot of the death scenes were offscreen, meaning there was not much gore. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. You will not lose interest with this one, it has a pretty decent story and will be a good addition to your collection. I would give it 3.5 stars."
3,The Tension Shoulders This 3 1/2 Star Suprise !,"I found ""SEVERED"" for a very cheap price & after reading a few good reviews here at amazon & also in fangoria buying it was a no-brainer. After watching it,I will have to agree with all the good reviews that I had read. It is nowhere near a great zombie film but it is also nowhere near a bad zombie film. While it has a handful of flaws it also has alot going for it-a good story,some good actors,good make-up/efx,plenty of chunky splattering blood & most impotantly some of the best tension I've ever seen in a zombie flick. The ending could have been much better & it is one of the most flawful parts of the movie but really the flaws can't out-weigh all the good there is in this flick,so in this horror/zombie fans opinion ""SEVERED:forest of the dead"" is a definite keeper & also one of the better indy zombie flicks to come out in recent years."
3,Cound have been excellent film,"This film COULD have been an excellent independent zombie flick that did a better job of capturing the mood of foreboding doom IF the makers had done one thing differently.............. A word to modern filmakers........ STOP trying to generate excitement in films with that choppy, strobelight-like editing that is SUPPOSED to (in the minds of some) add tension, but instead makes watching the film annoying and detracts from the visual effectiveness of the film."
4,Zombie Survivalist Horror Done Well,"Severed is the very definition of a good low budget movie. The director and production company obviously have talent and know how to put a film together. The actors are mostly unknown, but are very convincing. The one gripe I have is the story is not very original, but in this day of multi-million dollar Hollywood cookie cutter films, originality is hard to come by either way. While the plot is not original I will say the scripting is well done. This movie works, is scary, and if you are a zombie fan, then Severed is well worth your time."
2,didn't like it,"this is like the 2004 Dawn Of The Dead remake. The zombies are no good. They move around as fast as my curser on my computer screen. The newer modern day zombies are like that. I like the way zombies used to be slower and stiffer. Like the type Romero made years ago or like Lucio Fulcis zombies were in Zombie. There is alot of gore in the movie but the film too chaotic. The camera is too fast moving at times. Also, why is the movie so grainy? The blood when it splatters looks fake. Looks like computer made blood not real blood. Like I said, I didn't like it."
3,Please Don't Kill The Good Guys,I like zombie films and I like forests and I like the people who try to protect forests. OK OK so this film was rather campy BUT they were trying to make a good point. Too bad some of the protesters had to die. I like it better when just the bad guys get it but realistically this is not to be.
2,severed,"Bloody awful. Plot holes big enough to drive a logging truck through. Editted with a chainsaw. Written by a seventh-grader. If we stop watching movies like this, maybe they'll quit making them. An insult to the genre. ""Severed"" is what an art degree and $20 will get you."
4,timber,tree huggersvs. loggers fertilizer turns them into zombies.company tries to kill to keep seceret safe danger betrayal sacrefice abound in this one.
1,Be Careful,"I attempted to install this device on my HP computer. Every time I plugged in the USB cable, I received an error. When I called tech support I was informed that my Easy CD Writer software was causing a conflict with the device. When you go to the support page, you are informed of this conflict. It should be listed on the documentation that was provided. It would have saved me a great deal of time and effort. You have to download a patch file, to bad it didn't come on the installation CD."
1,Product and tech service disappointing,"I tried to install the ImageMate in a new Dell PC. I followed the instructions carefully and my computer crashed as soon as I plugged the device into the USB port. This happened several times and finally corrupted my modem software.After solving the modem problem I called SanDisk tech service. After two long periods on hold, someone said I'd get a call-back the same day. Never did. Didn't get a response from an email to their tech service people either. Stay away!"
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,THIS CARD READER IS CHEAP FOR A REASON. IT DOESN'T WORK 99% OF THE TIME. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INSTALL AND DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A DRIVER ON THE INSTALLATION CD. USING THE DRIVER OFF THEIR WEB SITE MADE MY COMPUTER CRASH.
4,JIMMY THE HAND,"IF U WANT A 'BOOK OF THE MONTH' LEFTOVER AND NOT A FIRST EDITION. THE BOOK IS OVER PRICED, BUT VERY GOOD READING. I'VE BEEN A FAN A LONG TIME."
2,I think he's run out of ideas,Sometimes I don't know why I keep coming back to Feist everytime I seemed to be disappointed with anything he's written. Jimmy was one of my favorite characters and the book they dedicate to him was just not interesting. I still would recommend his first series. Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master. Also would recommend his series he wrote with Janny Wurts. The Empire Trilogy.
2,Not his best work,"I have read nearly all of Feist's books and this series was the only one I had to really work at to get through the entire series and was disapointed in the end. Looking forward to starting the next Saga, when available."
3,Enjoyable Adventure in Midkemia,"Ok, so it's not an epic multi-volume tale like other Feist efforts. But it is definitely a highly entertaining story about one of the most endearing characters in the world of Midkemia, in his formative, yet still impressive years.I felt the writing style was very easy to read and you can easily get immersed in the story.If Feist (and friends) wrote another 20 books of Midkemian tales of this quality, I would read every one of them. I enjoy this world so much I can't get enough of it. There are millions of untold stories in Midkemia. Keep 'em coming."
3,"It's good, not great","I enjoy the world of Midkemia and everything that Mr. Feist has written. I enjoyed the other 2 novels in this series more than this one. I can tell you this, I have read novels by all three of the collaborating authors, and each novel is written in their own distinct style. I don't know if Mr. Feist gives a general outline to them, and possibly does some revisions, but this reads like a Stirling novel to me. That is all well and fine, but it didn't have the spark of Mr. Feist's usually work. All in all, it was enjoyable enough to read, and it does give you an even greater depth to the character, and the wonderful world of Midkemia."
2,Feist and Stirling Fan...,"But really nothing new or exciting here. I finished it, but I kept wanting to give it up. Sorry guys. Not sure what happened but it just wasn't there this time."
4,Good story,"As always, Mr Feist has told a fine story. Jimmy the Hand is a favorite of mine and this story gives more background to a good character."
2,Disappointed,It is a nice piece of electronic. It has a lot of effect and functions but it is really really difficult to use. Also following the manual it is really difficult. Better get something else. I actually sold it on ebay one week later.Disappointed.
5,Fantastic!,"Mystery of the Silver Coins is just as fantastic as Raiders from the Sea! The book begins when Bree and another slave named Lil escape from the Viking ship and begin a trek through the unfamiliar Norwegian mountains. When Mikkel, the young leader of the Viking raiders, realizes that his bag of silver coins is missing, as are Bree and Lil, he and his crew men begin to search relentlessly for the girls, convinced that they are the thieves.But as Bree and Lil draw farther away, Mikkel begins to wonder if some of the choices he has made were for the best. He also begins to wonder if Bree's God is really real and if the gods of the Vikings are not. Bree learns that sometimes God has a different plan for your life than you think He does. She also gets a special message that makes her wonder if getting taken by the Vikings was really a mistake, or if there was a special reason.Mystery of the Silver Coins will take you on an exciting adventure. A definite must-read for you and your family!"
3,Amaze about the size,"It is really amazing about the size of the memory, it even smaller than what I saw from the web, but the downsize is the capacity, I think it would be nice to have at least 16MB or bigger so that we don't keep so many pieces"
1,Avoid this product,"This software is a great disappointment. Here are some of the things it will *not* do.1. Won't backup over a network unless you remember to map network drives first2. Won't make incremental backups to a directory on a hard disk (this means you can't backup your laptop to a desktop unless you do complete backups every day)3. Won't allow you to select files to include in a backup (as opposed to exclude), such as *.jpg, for example, or files newer than a certain date.The last two options were avaiable in Norton Backup ten years ago, so there is no excuse for their exclusion in what is supposed to be a program that goes beyond the Windows 98 program.The program does not appear to distinguish between CD-R and CD-RW disks.Finally, the CD-R backups it produced were sometime unreadable, yet Veritas charge for technical support."
2,Awkward Product shows lack of customer focus.,"Version 2 shows lack of customer focus. I have used the emergency recovery feature. When creating a recovery disk it asks you to find the appropriate drivers for the SCSI and Jazz drives and tells you to search your manufacturers literature! Good luck on this. I could not get an emergency disk to work with my SCSI Jazz drive, and I am a reasonably educated user and program computers as part of my job.During an emergency recovery from tape, the program stops in the middle of a 4 hour restore to wait for your input everytime it encounters a problem. Any decent program would just put this in a log file for you to see later. In the first 700 files (out of 1200) it has stopped twice. This makes unattended operation almost impossibly slow. Also You also cannot restore multiple file systems at once.Even if they fixed this in a later version, how can you trust a company this sloppy with your data?"
2,Kind of expensive for what your getting,"Backup Exec is a fairly decent backup utility, but it is a bit pricy, and a hard to get used to interface. I can see someone in a big business using this, but if your a small/home office or just a home user, the free utilities that are bundled with Windows 95/98 will do the same job."
2,MichaelBuble.com even asks you not to purchase,"This DVD was released against the performers wishes and if you go to michaelbuble.com you will see that these songs were written for a film he was doing. Quote from website: UPDATEFROM MICHAELDear Fans,You've heard from me in the past regarding my thoughts on the ""Totally Buble"" not being a true representation of what I do. I have now been told of a DVD that is out in the market with the same name and art work. I feel the same way about this DVD. The old expression ""Buyer Beware"" has never been more appropriate. Thanks everyone.Michael"
2,Know what you're buying: only 16 minutes long...,"Audio is great, video is quite good, but don't be fooled by the fact that there is 8 titles; the entire lenght of this musical DVD is 16 minutes. A good 16 minutes, but still..."
1,should be called Totally Bogus,"This is nothing more than some people trying to cash in on Buble's name and fame. Shame on the company that's doing this. This is about people trying to fool you into thinking this is something he wanted. It's not. Thanks to other reviewers revealing the fact that he did not want this put out, I checked his fansites and sure enough, he didn't want this released. So that tells me the people trying to cash in on his hard work will not get my financial support.Totally Bogus."
1,Don't confuse this with all the rest of Buble's stuff,Here's a case of a promoter taking advantage of Michael Buble's rising fame. According to numerous sites and reports this product was not endorsed by buble.
5,"Great product, easy to use","I had chronic wrist pain and was barely able to use a computer for any length of time because of the mouse. I switched to an Easy Cat and have had 90% reduction in pain. There is so much less force required than a mouse, and you don't have to grip/hold it like you do a regular mouse. I would highly recommend this or a similar product to anyone with repetitive stress injury issues. I have used one on several different computers and only had software issues (which were resolved)on one computer. That was my work computer, and they do so many strange things to them here that I wasn't surprised it doesn't work."
1,terri,"These sponges are small, too firm and feel like a synthetic rubber on the skin. What ever happened to the similar sponges that were slightly larger (some say the kind that crumble) and feel more natural. They used to carry them at Fred Meyer stores (about one year ago) and I can't seem to find them anywhere. Suggestions?"
3,Ok..ish.,"I think that Grendel has potential to do some great things, but speaking for this album, I wasn't verry impressed. There are a few songs that are really good, but for the most part the vocals were recorded too low and many of the synth lines are verry basic and lack anything new or original. Grendel is related to the EBM/Industrial genre that is being done much better by artist such as Wumpscut, Suicide Cammando, and Hocico. I don't think Grendel is nearly as good as those bands are. Grendel has a long ways to go still...not a five star effort thus far."
2,Not the best album I've heard.,"This was my first Grendel album, and to be honest, I had almost given up on this artist based on this album. The lyrics are barried so far below the electronics that you can barely hear a single word, much less understand it. The music is cheap, and the synth notes are hardley impressive. All in all, this album is about a 2.5, but since I can't vote that way, I'd sooner give it a 2 than a 3. If your new to Grendel, don't start your collection here. The newer album ""Harsh Generation"" is way, way, way, way, way, way, better."
4,satisfied,"i had trouble finding adjustable weaver mount rings,these was the only choice i had at the time.if they wre made of steel versus alluminum i would have given it 5 stars"
1,Medieval Punishment (punishment for the reader),"I can't believed I paid so much for this book. I could have draw the pictures from the wood cuts. There was an obvious lack of information as well as the dating of the tortures. It read at a middle school level. If I didn't have to pay for the postage I would send it back. I learned nothing new by reading this. I'd stick to my own research if I were you. If it had been a book of the original woodcuts with approximate dates it would have been much more helpful. One woodcut, page 11 is said to be from the 11th century yet the people are wearing 17th century clothes and there is a spelling error on page 21. The price for this book should be about $4.00 instead of $14.95. Please just spend an hour in a good library and you would learn more."
2,The Complete Book of Silk Screen Printing,An interesting historical look at the nuts and bolts of screen printing in the early times. Fascinating for history buffs but of limited practical use in today's world.At its original publication it would have provided an incredible insight in to the then modern techniques.

1,Memorable..as the first book I didn't finish,"I so enjoy commonplace stories of quiet people. Picked up this book because the cover art and inside flap held promise--but it was written poorly.The story would go meander, as many good stories do, but then the author would use ""Meanwhile back at..."" which is not only a jolt out of the story, but also very amateurish.Character development stuck to a parable model, with characters either being good or bad. Bad characters were flawed and lost, while good characters were virtuous and stalwart. This is useful in 500 word parable--but amateurish in a novel."
3,Stegner books,I made a goal of purchasing all Stegner booksfor our local library to own. All I have ordered havebeen sent in timely fasion; all gifted to library now.
4,the hippie in the book was actually Ken Kesey,just a note for everyonethe hippie in the book was actually based on Ken Kesey
4,Fresh and tasty,"This latest volume in the Vampire Erotica series is full of great sensual vampire stories with various couplings (male-female, female-female, male-male, human-beast, and even a transgendered character). Every story is at least intriguing and mentally stimulating, if not actually hot and steamy. The outstanding stories for me are by Raven Kaldera (which includes the transgendered person), Margaret L. Carter (one of the most erotic stories I've read in ages; male-male, human-beast), and Mary Anne Mohanraj. This anthology also includes stories by Gary Bowen, Renée M. Charles, Elizabeth Thorne, Pagan O'Leary, and a host of others. If you like erotica with a bite, then this tome is for you."
2,sucks,my mom is a clean freak and she is 53 she hates this one she says its bad becase it does not clean that well and it is a mess to empety.
5,Get a Chubby,"Here's what you need to know about this mug: When I first got it, I filled up at Starbucks, and put it on the roof of my car to unlock the door. I got in and drove home.When i arrived, I got out of the car and there was my mug. On the roof. Where I'd left it miles ago.I'd driven fast, slow, stopped, started and all the way the mug stayed on my car.I locked my door, grabbed my mug and headed inside.Not a drop was spilled, and the coffee was still hot and fresh.Find one of these. You'll be happy."
1,WARNING dangerous teakettle,"I bought this teakettle for my elderly mother-in-law because it was lightweight. She loved her previous Reston Lloyd tea kettle but it had worn out. The spout on this one is attached too low. If you fill the pot too much the boiling water will spout out in bursts unexpectantly. I almost burned myself! If you order a Reston Lloyd Enamel tea pot, order the round one. I wish I could get a refund on the other one because it is useless."
1,"A Little Louder, Please!","The selections on these CD's are great, now if I could only hear them. The sound level on these CD's is so poor I have to crank my player up twice as loud as normal and then I end up losing sound quality. This may end up in the trash instead the donation box (to the library). Why would I subject someone else to a CD of this poor quality? I'm glad I only paid $5 for it, but it really was a waste of $5. Be warned."
5,A World Wide Extreme,"I love Christmas displays and this is one of the best books I've found. IT features displays from around the world in full, vibrant color."
2,pictures,"Plenty of pictures, so few words. We were hoping to find more info on decorating. Not worth the $."
3,Mixed Feelings,"As a recently bereaved sibling, I am immensely grateful to Dr. Wray for the existence of this book. It is also extremely readable. However, maybe I expected too much, but it did not really touch the areas in my grief that I was hoping for. I found it rather ""lightweight"". I guess I would sum up my reaction by saying I was disappointed in it - but it is a start in putting sibling grief on the map as a valid and painful experience."
5,Sibling grief.,Finally something to read that pertains exactly to my situation. Sibling loss affects everything and this book acknowledges it in a way I have not found through any other resource.
5,"Thank you, Ms. Wray, for this lovely book....","I am very grateful for this book. Since my sister's murder, 16 months ago, I have read everything I could put my hands on in search of answers. Unlike this book, most of the books I have read were a waste of time. The greatest question we surviving siblings all have, of course, is, ""Why?"" I have found that, sometimes, there are no answers, but Ms. Wray has shared her pain and her road back, and she gives me hope that there is a road back for the rest of us who have also lost a precious sister or a brother. Thank you, Ms. Wray, for this lovely book...."
1,Incorrect review,"I would like to take back my review found below. I thought I was reviewing Moanin' as released on Blue Note records. My comments below reflect that album, not this one. I am unfamiliar with this album."
4,Great for beginers...,"This video is greate for those of you with minor wood working skills and want to take on the world of Cabniet Making. The video is outdated, but the know how still applies today! I started by building cabinets for my work shop to get a start. I followed Paul's instructions and walla... It worked. I just finished building a mobel Kitchen Island and it turned out great! Nice base cabinet, dove tail draws and a tile top (tiles are not covered in the video). I'm now moving on to building a wet bar and this video has made this possible. This is the only video, that I could find, that just focuses on Cabinet Makeing. I think it is a good video to take any novice wood worker to the next level!"
1,Very disappointing product with serious design flaw. Don't waste your $,"This food processor seemed perfect - large enough and powerful enough to do almost anything! However, it was brought to its knees by grating cheese. I tried to grate mozzerella for pizza and the top flew off, spraying cheese everywhere. I called Kitchaid and they suggested I had a faulty item, and offered to exchanged it. The same thing happened with the next one.. and the next one... To Kitchaid's credit, they handled the exchanges very well. Finally, Kitchaid replaced my food processor with another model - a 12 cup smaller version, which has been fabulous, and grates mozzeralla just fine. I called recently to find out if they have addressed this design flaw as I really liked the idea of such a large powerful machine, but was told the design was not changed. I feel it is irresponsible of Kitchenaid to keep selling a product with an obvious problem. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I have had this machine for about a year, and I use it fairly often. The poor bowl design that gets BOTH bowls dirty when you use either of the smaller insert bowls has been an annoyance, but was (sort of) balanced out by the power and control, which are good. However - last night the top blew off and the large bowl locking mechanism broke when I was grating cheese. Other reviewers have had the exact same problem. I wish I had seen those reviews before I spent all that money. Kitchenaid needs to redesign the bowl system completely, and I would strongly recommend not buying this unit until they do."
4,Food processor,The Kitchenaid Pro Line Food Processor is great. Really like the large capacity and the nice assortment of attachments included.
2,KitchenAid kpfp850pmo food processor,"Great tool until it started frying the starting capacitor. Fantastic power (evidenced by dimming the lights in neighboring cities). Replacing the capacitor very short term fix. Considering the cost of this unit, it should have lasted forever."
4,Boudicca - Warrior Queen,"I found this programme more convincing than many of its kind, for the very reason that the previous reviewer seems to dislike it. It is not a fault not to take sides even if one is led by a woman who is also Celtic. No matter how romantic the images that that combination may evoke all it amounts to is material for a romance.I did not find the argument pro-roman. In fact it expressly endorses a judgement at the end that the whole episode was a disgrace to all concerned, in human terms. The presentation of the maps is merely a matter of taste, I can't say it bothered me either way because the narrative was convincing. History is rarely pretty - what is of the greatest importance in studying history is to avoid the mistake of seeing things in terms of easy answers, of goodies and baddies. This programme steers clear of this trap, whilst suggesting an interesting insight into which power group may have been pulling the strings behind this challenge to the great Roman Empire."
4,Polo Double Black,"Polo Double Black is based on Polo Black, but it's a lot spicier and sweeter in smell. This fragrance is only suitable for very mature men. It's hard to imagine anyone younger than say 50 pulling this off."
4,what you won't do for love,"This book was a good read. I really didn't like Rochelle or Cerina and they were both evil to me. Cerina was wrong for the way she went about doing things but ""what you won't do for love""Can't wait until Lee comes out with another book."
1,Junk food for your brain!,"This book might as well have been a soap opera on the LOGO channel! Although it has it's twists and turns, the book is, for the most part predictable and stereotypical. The women in this book are throw away characters, even if you feel sympathy for them at all, they really weren't necessary, and were probably added by Zane to add drama in the last edit of the book. The majority of the men don't do the right thing, and they pay for it in the end. *yawn*If you're looking for a high quality read, this isn't it. If you're looking for a gay Jerry Springer episode, you've found it!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS PART I,I DIDN'T THINK THIS BOOK WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BOOK. IT WASN'T THAT EXCITING. I THOUGHT JAMES WAS GONNA COME BACK SOMEHOW.
2,Cheeze-Whiz,"Lee Hayes is a new author to me. I received the book and read the excerpt in the back of PASSION MARKS. The excerpt was excellent--fast paced, touching on a subject that I'd never seen addressed in literature, domestic abuse in the gay community. Loved it. But then I start to read A Deeper Blue and had to stop after CH. 13. The sex scences between the men and women were too over the top, cheesy and unnecesary. Some of the phrasing ""final end"" ""even still"" ""with much attitude"" was annoying. POV shifts made it difficult at times to know whose story it is. The female characters were unrealistic (the scene between Cerina and Rachelle at the mall did not ring true.) The male interactions are the money scenes in ADB. Between the men there is passion, lust, love---in other words, range and depth. The female characters were caricature distractions that slowed the story. I got bored and put the book down efore I finished it."
5,WONDERFULL READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book will make you cry, make you sad, make you laugh, and smile.. I loved this book, you have to make sure that you get passon marks first, then read this book.. I am a staight female and these are the first two books that i have ever read that was written about homosexuals and their relationships at first I thought it would be all about sex and I didn't want to know those kind of details, but this book really very interest, i love this author and i hope he makes a part 3 to this.I will highly recommend everyone purchase both books and read it."
4,Hayes Steps It Up...,"Well, Well, Well. I was pleased. Hayes steps it up with his sequel to Passion Marks. I still was not able to get a really good picture of the characters in my mind, but it was still good. His writing style has vastly improved from the 1st book. It's hot...It's steamy...and It definitely gets you going. Although I am a heterosexual female, I found myself getting aroused by the homosexual love scenes....DAMN Hayes....I ain't mad atcha! It gets kinda slow at the end...I was ready for it to be over already, but it was a good book. I look forward to other writing by Hayes. As I expected, he gets better with time. Get it...read it....and enjoy. Peace and Blessings!!"
5,Wow,This was a great book. After I read the first book I had to read this on. Both books are very good. They had me wanting to read more. I am now ready for the next. :)
2,Fell apart after 4 weeks,"Installed it, and the little compressor fell apart after about 4 weeks. Was past my return date, so I was stuck with it. Makes a great paperweight!"
2,FIAMM- not what they used to be.......short lived compressors,"I have bought an installed 3 FIAMM horn sets in as many years. I have had the 2 and 3 trumpet types over the last 3 years. I love the sound they produce and are great for making ""Radical Arrogant pedal pushers"" crap themselves! However, the compressors are so cheaply designed and made with poor materials that they only last less than a year. FIAMM's produce a great sound but like many things today, they are short lived. I have heard that the ""HELLA"" trumpets have a much better built compressor? I will surely have an oppurtunity to test them soon? I just wish they had a directional turret to give the best effect?!"
4,"Good read, little disappointed in the end","I did enjoy this book.Though I did get a little put off with Cory's attitude, and why everyone else put up with her.And the experimental aircraft was a bit much.I had to go back a few times because of all the governmental abbreviations and see what they were talking about.But all in all it was a good read."
5,Can't Put Down - Must Read Yarn!,"I haven't enjoyed reading a tale like this in a long time. Fast moving and interesting, written with an air of plausibility, I didn't have to suspend disbelief to enter the world created by the authors and enjoy the experience. One of the few novels of this genre that I'd read again!"
5,Awesome! A Must read!,"This, to me, is a great book. It starts out a little slow but from the moment Captain Webber gets shot and starts the deadly game of hide and seek from the terrorists on the ice in Antartica, the pace quickens and it never slows down much throughout the entire book. Although the character of Dr. Rey was an extremely annoying one, and at times I actually found myself practically hating her, to me that is a mark of great writing. Characters so believable that they actually evoke strong emotions from you! The character of General Abbot was a great one, although I certainly hope there are not people like him in our military. He was so wrapped up in his quest to achieve personal glory and for his place in history that he was willing to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve it. All in all, an awesome book. If you are a Tom Clancy fan like me, this is a must read!"
3,Icefire review,"This book was well-written, but it got boring at times. The authors used WAY too many abbreviations for things (like government agencies, etc.). How are we supposed to keep them all straight? NORAD, NEST, OPCOMM, NCMM, NSCS, etc, etc, etc. It's quite confusing in that respect. Otherwise, it was decent and entertaining for the most part."
3,impressive as a technological thriller but weak on suspense,"I had high expectations for this novel given therave reviews. However, there just was not enough fast paced action to keep me intersted. THere were lots of action scenes but I found them rather contrived and unrelated and did not push the overall storyline forward. Instead of wasting your money on this, try starting George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings: they kick ass. I shall now go out and buy War and Peace. Wwwwaauugghh!!!!"
5,AWESOME TECHNO-THRILLER!,"J&G have done it again. Best ""can't-put-it-down"" suspense I've read in a while! The idea is frighteningly real and made it the great book it was. Very convincing and very suspenseful. Can't wait for a movie!"
2,"Trite, far-fetched, and riddled with errors","Let's see - the hero and heroine broke up 5 years ago but just happen to meet again in Antartica as nuclear weapons are exploding; the hero, a Navy Captain, can fly everything from choppers to harriers to the SR-71; a two-star general at the Pentagon subordinates warning people about a killer tidal wave to his own ambition. Go on, make a ridiculous movie out of it, but don't pretend that it has any credibility as a novel. While the plotting is somewhat compelling, the characters are shallow and the dialogue is trite. I cannot judge the feasibility of the tidal wave creation by nukes and the ensuing carnage, etc, but their clumsiness with other details such as military rank and yields of nuclear weapons destroys one's confidence in the rest of their material. (They twice refer to a weapon as 5.5 megatons, but then call it 550 kilotons and they get the relative strength of a 20 megaton bomb and the Hirshima bomb wrong, also by a factor of ten.)"
1,Very unhappy,This lens just dose not work. Because of the have to have tunnel adapter there is no advantage. You can take better shots without this waste of space lens. I am supprised Kodak even make one available for this camera it just does not work. Do not waste your money.
1,Returned item,I returned this item. I have not received notice that they did receive it back so I will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited.
3,Great lens bad flash issue,"I did tons of research on this item before purchasing and found over and over again the concensus was the lens was not to be used with the built-in flash. I whole-heartedly agree. This lens is great for daytime shots, but don't even bother at night unless you have a hand-held flash to use. Using a photo editing software will not compare to just buying a hand-held flash and making the photos work right from the start. I don't understand why Kodak even bothers to push this lens for cameras that you can't use the full functionality with. They say nothing on their own site about the flash issues, so you wouldn't know unless you did the research yourself. Great lens, just do yourself a favor and get a separate flash!"
1,Specification doesn't mention adapter need compatible camera,"I felt bad with this purchase. When the product arrived, I noticed that it needed an adapter to fit in my camera Kodak Z-7590, what is not mentioned in the specifications.The site page just says that the lens is compatible with my camera.To worsen the adapter needed is not more avaliable for purchase."
3,Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach xenar 0.7 wide angle lens,The lens takes clear pictures but is not any good with flash. It leaves a large dark spot in the bottom of the picture. It doesn't increase the view as much as I thought but it is very clear.
5,awesome,Thank you for the fast shipment. I had looked everywhere from a 50 milie radius from my house and could not find this fingernail polish. I love it. thanks.
4,Shatter,"This nail polish is so fun! I love the way it looks, but it does not last very long compared to other OPI nail polish I have tried. I would not use this polish without a top-coat. It is also hard to just do a touch-up without having to redo the entire nail. The polish is a little clumpy, so don't be afraid. It also looks bad when you first put it on, but once it ""shatters"" it looks great! I would definitely recommend this polish :)"
1,Horrible,I purchased this and it did not work at all. I tried to return it and the company I purchased it from would not allow me to. Be careful who you buy this from. I would suggest buying it at the store to make sure it works so you can return if it does not.
2,I was shocked,I thought it looked more silver so i got it and it looks more blue green. I buy OPI more than any other brand and when this one got to my door I just kept asking myself why? do I buy polish from them that looks wrost than the $1 polish thats at every store.
1,what a rip off!!!!!,If this site had half a star thats what I would have gave them! I cant belive how dumb I was thinking that it would look like this in the picture. It's flat black with no kinda shine I don't get it at all. I thought you get what you pay for so I bought it for $9 waited almost 2 weeks before it came in the mail.just for me to feel the mud on my face.
1,never receive this item!!!,"I ordered 11 polishes from NailEtc, only received 5 in the parcel and the seller didn't mention anything about it. This one is one of the missings. I was so looking forward to this one, which made me soooooooooooooooo disappointed. But I got my refund at the end."
1,I want my money back!!,"What are prople raving about??? this product sucks! I applied it according to directions, and the final effect was nothing like ""shattered"", more like ""streaky""!! All my co-workers agree, they have bought it and think the product is horrible."
4,opi shatter,dries to fast you cant keep it for more than 2months before it gets chunky and have to replace it
2,It was Alright...,"I first tried the silver crackle polish and fell in love with it, so I had to try the white! I chose a hot pink color for the base and waited for it to dry completely, I then applied the white crackle and waited for it to dry. It completely picked up on the pink and turned itself into a light pink color of its own. My finger nails looked like Valentine's Day colors! Needless to say, it wasn't what I was expecting. I will keep trying it to see if I can find a good color combo, but so far, nothing looks that great with it."
1,This is not shatter polish!!!,"I don't know what is in these bottles that I received, but it is not shatter polish. I purchased black and white shatter. Both polished on like white out. The result was not even close to how it was supposed to be. I have had crakle and shatter polish done before, so I know how it should look. I wasted my money on this. I would've been better off going into a retail store to buy it. Can someone tell me what went wrong with this company?? What is in these bottles that I have?? It sure isn't shatter polish!!"
1,TERRIBLE!,After opening a brand new bottle it instantly got clumpy. It feels and looks like white out. My husband thought it looked like an 8 year old painted my nails for me.... simply awful!
1,DO NOT purchse the White Shatter,"I loved the black shatter so much over my bright and light colors that I was so excited to have the white for my dark colors.But this white shatter is SUCH a disappointment. it does not shatter nearly as well as the black does, in fact it barely shatters at all, and on some of the colors it litterally does not stick to them and wipes right off. I wish I had known this before I spent 11 dollars on it in the store because I hate it. it makes me scared to try any of the other colors besides the black."
3,Not good,Bought this a while back when the crackle fad was pretty new. This product only lasted a few uses before it got really thick and clumpy and unusable. I have never had this problem with a polish before. It did work but seemed like it was old when I got it.
3,Awesome Look but...,"I first bought this nail polish when this ""Shatter"" trend was really popular at school and i was really happy that it came super fast and that the price wasn't too bad either. I immediatley tested it and loved the way it looked and got so many compliments. Now my complain is that it dries and clumps up really fast. It wouldn't even take a minute for it to clump up and the next time i went to use it, I was really hard to open the bottle. Although i really loved this Shatter look, i dont think i'll purchase this specific brand again."
1,Totally see thru and barely shatters...,"I own a black shatter by Sinful Colors. They were out of the white or I would have bought it. I did a multi colors bright pattern and then painted over with shatter and LOVED it. So I thought a pastel pattern with a white shatter would give a more subtle springtime effect. So I decided to go with an OPI because I've heard such great things... WRONG!! This polish is so see thru that I can see all the edges of the patterns underneath and it barely even shattered, mostly it looks like long streaky lines down my nail. So disappointed. Never buying shatter from OPI again. Guess I should have saved my money and waited for the Sinful Colors version."
2,Not the best...,"I used a white shatter for the first few times and it came out gorgeous. But after about four times I used it, It started to get into clumps. i used it the most i could, but soon the whole thing became a large clump like a wet foundasion applier. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get anything out."
5,Awesome,"This nail polish is sick. At one angle, it looks purple. At another, it looks green. It also stays on well. There's nothing bad about this polish. It also does look great under crackle."
2,"Even with two coats, very transparent","Beautiful color in the bottle. Really looking forward to receiving. Very transparent, even with two coats! Oh well. Still going to keep it. May use it as top coat for other polishes."
5,Great Crackle.,"I have Sally Hansen crackle polish from Walmart, and then I have this nail polish. There is definitely a difference in quality. It cracks perfectly, in all the right places, and hasn't gotten goopy in storage like my Sally Hansen."
2,LOVE THIS STUFF !!! ?-update?,"Everywhere I go I have somebody complimenting my nails, and asking me about them, telling me how much they like them. It's a must have for any nail polish collection, I'm going to be purchasing the shatter in silver ASAP so I can wear it with dark shades too! Best part? even if you have trouble with the painting your right hand, it doesn't matter with this stuff because it's not supposed to be perfect, and touch ups are hardly noticeable!**UPDATE** 12/31/11For some reason the polish is all goopey and gross already. It is very difficult to use, and I'm not really happy about it... don't really understand what happened...**UPDATE** 2/11/12It's so thick and goopey that It's completely un-usable. even if i am able to get it smoothly across my nail, it no longer will ""evaporate"" (or however it works to create the ""shattered"" look). I'm really disappointed."
5,"Great product, great experience.","I recieved this nail polish brand new, cheaper than trying to find it in stores that have been sold out, and I recieved it a lot sooner than was expected. Very, very pleased."
4,"Hot, hot, hot!",Super fun product! Just make sure the color you use underneath has dried for HOURS before applying the shatter. The Shatter dries almost instantly and was surprisingly easy to remove with nail polish remover.
4,Teenage Dream - super holographic sparkle,"Before buying Teenage Dream, I looked over tons of photos and read a lot of descriptions but somehow missed that this contains quite a lot of holographic glitter. It's a bit too eye-catching on my entire nail unless it's a holiday or a party (even under fluorescent lighting, it catches and reflects light like nobody's business), but for everyday, I do like using this to paint on a bling-bling pink French tip on my toe nails. That's just the right amount of sparkle for me. The really nice thing about this polish is that it's PACKED with glitter... with this, I don't need to build up thick layers of polish to get the dense coverage of glitter I want. Just one coat is all I use - there's still visible nail line with 1 coat which doesn't bother me, but if VNL bothers you 2 coats will do the trick (or use a coat of white nail polish as your base, then put Teenage Dream over that)."
3,It is what it is,"There was a lot of hype for this product in the Cosmetology field and I thought I might as well try it out, being a nail polish guru myself. They were sold out in stores so I proceeded to buy from Amazon and when it came, I tried it on and was not happy.Some of my co-workers like this product but I guess it all depends on personal taste. I think it gives a ""dirty"" look because it is black shatter and makes your nails look dark while still being able to see the polish underneath.This polish darkens the polish underneath so it is better to put it over a bright or light color and not a dark color like navy or dark purple."
2,Not the Best Shatter,"I love OPI products - but their Shatter.... not so much. The nail polish is clumpy and doesn't give you the desired effect. I think if it was watered down a bit it would dry nicer and apply easier. I have used a few other Shatters by different brands and have found that I prefer them over OPI, which is a first."
4,This stuff is so fun,"I really like this stuff, it looks great with bright colors under it. Mine came 1 day quicker than the expected delivery date. I just wish they made it in all colors."
3,Dries too fast!,"i bought a bunch of these as gifts for young girls, I think the resounding review is it dries too fast!!! But the effects are good."
4,Skinny dippin in the dark!,"OPI anything is always amazing & will hold up much, much longer than any other polish, promise! (I've tried them all) The only thing wrong with ""Last Friday Night"", is that it's really not blue at all. It's basically just a clear glitter. Maybe after 4 coats, you may see the slightest tint of blue... Maybe. Again, still love OPI!"
5,LOVE this nail polish!!!!!,"I absolutely love this nail polish!!! It looks great and works exactly the way its advertised too. I would definitely tell anyone thinking about ordering to go for it! You will absolutely love it!!!! The directions that come attached to the bottle are easy to follow and your nails will look awesome when done. Make sure to use a clear coat over the top, it adds shine and makes the color under the black pop out! The company that sent it to me had it in the mail and to me 3 days earlier than date of receipt projected when I ordered."
3,Not really a grey polish,"This polish is only sort of grey, with undertones of green and pink. I don't think the green and pink really show up in the photo of the bottle, but it's noticeable in the bottle in person. The polish has a bit of very subtle glittery sparkle to it.I think what OPI was going for was a sort of opal look with this, and it vaguely looks opal-ey, but not enough that I'll wear this color anywhere close to regularly. It's the usual OPI quality in terms of durability and ease of use, though, so I can't really give it less than three stars. The color doesn't really do it for me, but I am sure it's right for someone. If the photo had been accurate I probably wouldn't have bought it. I also didn't read the reviews before I bought it - most of the reviews are for a completely different color and style of polish that Amazon has ported to this color."
5,Amazing!!!,Teenage Dream is the best glitter polish I have ever had. I never usually wear glitter on my nails as its exceptional hard to take off but this combination of pink flecks and holographic glitter!!! Best polish of the year!
2,"Cool effect, poor quality :'(","It came out really cool after I learned to apply it, but after a month, the nail polish dried up inside the bottle. I wasn't storing it in an unusual manner and I never left the top unsealed, so I don't know why this would happen. Maybe mine was defective, but the few uses I got out of it were not worth the price. I'm surprised this hasn't happened to more people. I love OPI, but the Katy Perry crackle line didn't cut it. I blame her."
1,do NOT get the black shatter! you will waste your money!,"ok so i got the black shatter ($10 freakin' bucks) and it lasted for about 2 months. It was my favorite nail polish to use! i used it all the time. after a few months. it became extremely thick and chunky. now about 4 months after having it, it has completely shattered itself IN THE BOTTLE! I LEGIT CAN'T EVEN OPEN IT BECAUSE IT SHATTERED ON THE LIL TWISTY OPEN. ITS AWFUL. buuuuutttttttt on the other hand, i have the red and silver shatters and they are great, but the red is a lil shear and pretty much only shows up on white and even then it comes out more pink than red. other than that tho i love the shatters EXCEPT the black. don't get the black. spend your money on another shatter colorps: im a girl. not sure why my brothers name is coming up as the writer of this."
3,Kinda a let down.,"I was super excited when I first received this because I had been wanting to buy it for several months. And when I tried it out I fell in love with it immediately. Unfortunately, that only lasted a few uses. For some reason (I've had it about 2 weeks), it just doesn't crack right anymore. It's very goopy. And if you take more than one swipe to cover your whole nail, it will be thicker in the middle where you apply more than one coat. Also, if you mess up, you have to redo the entire nail (base coat and all)."
5,One of my favorites!,"I love this stuff! Sometimes I layer it with a silver, metallic hot pink or purple and the effect is perfect! You don't even have to be perfect about it, just slap it on and it is dry in seconds! Just make sure the colored layers underneath are totally dry before you put the shatter coat on..Get a quick dry top coat and you good to go!"
5,"Fascinating, multilayered color","It's silver. No, it's purple. No, it's green. This polish changes color in the light. It's got the same quality as fish scales in that respect. Love it, especially under black shatter. And if you've never used OPI before, it's an awesome nail polish. Easy to apply, good color, etc."
4,thick polish!!,the only thing that i dont like is tht the polish is really thick!! i have to go get some paint thinner to thin it out so it works properly
3,meh...,It is ok -- it is def darker with more purple hues than expected. ended up giving it to my sister.
2,disappointing,"Polish color looks like mermaid vomit. Its not silver at all, like a green-ish purple and it isn't opaque. I have put on two coats and I can still see through it. No thanks."
2,Good Polish but..,The polish itself is great. Opi is great. But what I got was a used nail polish already opened...and with dried nail polish leaking out. I wasn't aware I was buying a used product.
3,Better Marketing PLEASE,Ok I have to admit. This product is great. Be careful though. I bout 3 of the nail polishes thinking they were all shatter. nope. On the title of the product it says Katy Perry OPI Shatter Nail Polish. Well they are not all shatter. Now I have wasted $10 and now I am extremly mad. really. This was going to be a birthday gift. Advertise a little more clearly please!!!!!!!!!
2,OK,"The color arrived and it looks nothing like the pic. The color is a pretty color, but it looks more of a reddish, then purple like the photo. And plus it has glitter in it."
1,DIDN'T GET WHAT I PAID 4!!!,SO I RECIEVED THIS NAVY POLISH EXCEPT FOR WHEN I WEAR IT IT'S BLACK. THANKS!!! I PURCHASED SEVERAL MORE AT THE THE SAME TIME AND I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH TWO OUT OF THE FIVE OR SIX THAT I HAVE PURCHASED THUS FAR.
3,Shatter,"Product arrived on time, yet was used and only about 3/4ths full. Dried polish all around the edges. Great product yet, wish I got it new like description said."
2,SAD :(,Well i ordered the silver polish and got the red. I very much dislike the red and now im very sad that i didnt get waht i bought. oh well i just wish i hadnt used it so i could return it. also the red is very thin and should only be used over and color
2,The color is very light,"I was expecting a very bright blue. Instead, when painted on nails, it looks mostly like a clear (with some shades of blue) nail polish. I'm disappointed. With the shatter nail polish on top, you can't even tell that it's blue nail polish under it."
3,Nice Polish for the Right Persons,"I used it once with a shatter over it. Didn't look that good. Would be better on its own. Also very difficult to remove, my nail technician had to use her electric polish remover to get it off. I think the name says it all - Teenage Dream. I think the younger girls would love it."
3,"Review for ""Last Friday Night""","Disappointing. Looks great in the bottle, but it is so sheer going on. Is it supposed to be used as a glitter top coat? The bottle is marked ""Nail Lacquer,"" so I assumed it was a real polish color, but all I really get is a hint of blue with a lot of glitter. I'd hoped it would be bright blue with glitter."
2,became clumpy,"I bought this the very first time i used it i noticed it was very thick and resulted in it not want to ""crack"" right so was leaving big black globs not sure what happened it just started clumping up i wouldnt by op again not for crackle at least"
2,More of a clear with blue glitter than a blue with glitter...,"I bought this color for my nieces, but I had to take it off, put a base color on, and then put this color on. There is no blue base color, just the blue glitter which doesn't look all that great on nails, as it does in the bottle."
3,great...for a little kid.,"Although the shatter polish does exactly as described, in the end it just looks messy. Its awesome towatch as the color crackles before your eyes! When I was done with all my nails, it looked like a fiveyear old had painted them. The effect is cool from afar, but close up looks horrible. I wouldn't waste my money and buy another bottle."
2,"Not all its ""cracked"" up to be","I had really high expectations for this and was really excited when I received it in the mail. I had seen tons of reviews, both text and video and they were all positive. But when I first tried it on I was really disappointed. First it has a weird consistency and is quite lumpy. So it does not go on smoothly AT ALL. And it dries weird too. It looks and feels like you have tacky tar on your fingernails. As for the ""shatter"" it just look like someone painted black gook onto my fingernails and then dragged a toothpick through the substance to give it ""crackles"". It makes my nails look horrible and really cheap and honestly kind of like white trash. It is absolutely nothing like you see on videos. And you have to put a top coat on or it looks chalky and will probably flake off within the first 5 minutes of wearing it. I was so disappointed and honestly I want my money back!"
5,Love the color,I love this polish. It's packed with fine glitter. nice to wear alone or as a top coat over any base color you have. I recommend this product.
5,Love this color!,This is a great color to add to my collection of nail colors. I have many brands in my collection but the OPI colors are the best!
3,Great product!,"Great product, but after a while it get's clumpy/thick and the brush needs to be cleaned. Other than that A+ I have 3 bottles!"
5,awesome,"The best thing out there!!! Love this nail product,it is a great way to jazz up your nail polish. After you use it make sure to put a clear coat on top to protect and give it shine!"
5,Hot book for a HOT Babe,"This is a must have pictorial book for all the Pamela Lee Anderson fans! It features many compromising photos of Pam. See this Baywatch Babe in many different swimsuits and outfits as well. You will not be disappointed by the content. Hurry up and purchase the girl featured most ever on ""Playboy"" covers!"
2,Don't buy it for the pictures.,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is small, a little larger than a paperback novel. The pictures are poor quality. Poor quality meaning bad coloration, grainy, and uninteresting (most pictures are press or news type images). I bought the book because I think Pam is beautiful, and I like looking at pictures of her. I think I would of liked this book more if I was interested in her life story, which seems to be the focus. This is a cheap small biography of Pam with not so great pictures. If you want a good book FULL of good pictures of Pamela Anderson, I recomend ""Pamela Anderson Her Life in Pictures"" by Stephen Wayda."
3,Disturbing.,"Gays who depend on their looks to get them by when they are 35 and over are in for a surprise. We all age. Our sexual audience diminishes. Look inside yourself and start figuring out what you have to offer the world besides your big penis and pecs. Sadly, most gays end up with depression and suicidal thoughts once they realize they are lacking a strong sense of self."
3,Dated Analysis,"In the 70's when the work was first done, articles appeared in Harvard Business Review and the study then was closely associated with Boston Consulting Group. Much has happened since and the book is just a rewrite of the earlier results. I suggest you get the HBR articles, they cover the material well."
3,Old Stock Hp 23 Tri-color Ink Cartridge Twin pack,"Took a gamble and found so-so result. The first cartridge worked great but the second was defective, no red ink, and failed test at the refill store."
3,"New good, old bad","Many (most?) of these HP23 cartridges advertised as new but at about half the normal price are well past the expiration date. If you are lucky they will work and if you are not lucky they won't work. If you are lucky the seller will refund your purchase price on the bad ones. If you are not lucky, as was my experience with modelf22, he either won't be willing to or can't figure out how to or doesn't get around to it. In that case file a claim with Amazon under the Amazon A-to-z gaurantee and there is a good chance that Amazon will refund your money promptly and then deal with the seller themselves. The advertised Twin Pack I bought really was a twin pack and neither cartridge worked, as they were six years past the install by date. I ended up getting a new cartridge at twice the price from a merchant with a lot of real stores and also an on-line presence."
1,HP 23 TRI-COLOR INK CARTRIDGE,COMES WITH FEW INK. NOT RECOMMENDED. SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET THE BRAND NEW ORIGINAL. YOU MAY BE CAN PRINT VERY FEW PAGES 2 OR 3 AND THEN THE COLORS BEGIN TO FAIL.
3,Probably the best but still I want more...,"The is probably the best English language identifier but I still find a lot of stamps that aren't listed here. I wish the editors would start with page one of the Scott catalogs and list every word on every stamp. A Herculean task? Maybe but much more useful. Still, though, for the price, this is a very nice guide that will serve all collectors very well."
4,Puzzle,"I've done numerous of these Bepuzzled mystery puzzles and they're always a lot of fun. This particular one was a good puzzle but had a very weak story to go with it. So overall, not one of the better Bepuzzled."
3,For fans only,I have always enjoyed Scritti Politti from my boom there she was days of technicolored spiked hair and oval hats to his wood beez. I bought Black beer and couldn't stop listening to that cd and came accross this cd. I had to have it and am happy to have it in my collection. I have listened but this cd is not for everyone. It is truly a reminiscent cd of his earlier days. Although my friends have not grown to like the Early CD they do enjoy some of his other works I throw in. Keep this cd in your closet for true Scritti fans only.
5,Great start to a new form factor for Consumer memory devices,"Sandisk has (or plans to have) 8M, 16M, 32M and 64Mbyte MultiMedia Cards within this year.These memory modules can be used in MP3 players, but will be very useful in Digital Camera's, especially there small form factor, will make it very easy to carry many images in a small postage size memory."
2,how much?,"keep this in mind. if a 750MB, 80minute CD-R is set up for as a data disc, it can hold 185 songs of about 4minutes a song. then a 16MB chip could only hold about 4 songs with an average length of 4 minutes. NOW my numbers could be off, but they show that you would have no variety in your library."
4,"Err, they do in fact wear out...eventually.","There are always a finite number of writes until the media is ""worn out""."
3,MP3 Player extra-memory card.,This product is a 16Mb extra-memory pack for the MP3 player. You can stock your songs in it and keep your cards as tapes.
3,"Not the best, but it does the job","I bought this used and the quality matched its label. The book glosses over a lot of important concepts that your teacher should further explain. Also, the sentences can be quite ridiculous to translate in terms of both grammar and meaning. The appendices are really good though as a reference when doing paradigms and synopses. Overall, I recommend this more as a supplemental book rather than the actual textbook to use for an Intensive Latin course."
4,Excellent Textbook,"This is the test I used to learn Latin and I benefited greatly from its structure, organization, and exercises. It is one of the best language textbooks I've engaged with and I'd recommend it to beginners interested in learning about the Romance languages."
4,Knows not to read history backward,"OK, it's pricey, but Nick Smart's book on the Phoney War is an admirable addition to the literature on the period and should be on the shelves of those seriously interested in World War II. He looks at the information available at the time and assesses the actions of the participants based on what they knew then and how they planned to reach the goals they envisioned. If you're looking for another of the endless exercises in monday morning quarterbacking, you won't find it here. What you will get is a balanced, insightful summary of a period when several possible outcomes were in evidence. If Hitler had gotten his way and attacked in the autumn, and if the General Staff had gotten its way and recapitualted the Schlieffen Plan, it all could have gone quite differently."
4,Mystery by Lescroart,"Good mystery. I loved the characters. They are well developed, though I understand author uses the same characters in each book. Especially liked the woman attorney. I must admit I knew who did it about half way through the book, but the twists and turns still kept me guessing. I do recommend the book."
2,"Too Predictable, By-the-Numbers","John Lescroart is a fine writer, but he has produced a subpar effort here.There is nothing about THE SUSPECT that I found remotely original or interesting. The characters are walking cliches, and the rather thin plot is something you've seen many times before in countless novels and TV programs. I would be willing to forgive this problem if the plot had some momentum to it. But in the end, it doesn't. This book is just plain flat and uninspiring.THE SUSPECT isn't terrible, and is probably not that different from some of the old Ellery Queen or Perry Mason mysteries of the 1960s and 1970s. But in an age where there are far better books available (and far less reading time), my advice is not to waste your time on this one."
2,Well written but a tired plot,"First novel I've read by the author ... I like his writing style ... however the plot leaves a lot to be desired, many holes and unresolved threads ... i don't want to list them here because it could spoil the ending, but I think there were no fewer than 10 gaping holes in the story, plus the author pulls a cheap trick at the end disclosing evidence which would have been known from the beginning and allowed the case to be closed immediately. Apparently the lead lawyer/police did know so one has to question why it took 480 pages for them to put two and two together.However, i would definitely read another book by Lescroart ... he writes well. Just need to find one where the plot holds up better and the story is complete."
3,Suspense,Lescroart has done it again - while the stable of characters have gotten older thay make for high definition suspense.
5,Loved it!,Although I didn't enjoy The Hunt Club - John Lescroat comes back with another great courtroom drama - He is very detailed and keeps you hanging on every page.
3,great but no a2dp..,"It's a great phone with lots of features...advantages-lots of add ons software, themes including 3D games available-new firmware is quite stable-flawless sync with outlook with groups, categories supportdisadvantages-sound quality not that good compared to sony w810i-no a2dp (means u can't use stereo headset for listening to songs-slow UI-batttery life not that good"
4,Very Good phone!,"Very advanced software, image quality, expandable memory, and good looking. just it is very slow in browsing, and it is extremely slow if you install any wallpaper."
1,The Title Says It All,"I purchased this product from a third party seller when the price dropped down to around two dollars. Had I paid much more I'd have felt fairly ripped off. If you're a Lynch fanatic, nothing I say will stop you from acquiring this DVD. However, if you are not a die hard completist, you can probably find something better to spend your money on. I suppose Lynch was trying to create the dumbest possible thing he could, and he succeeded. It's even worse than Dune. While I don't begrudge his compulsion to create this tripe, I'm not sure why he has it for sale. Between ""Dumbland"" and ""Dynamic:01"", Lynch seems intent on wrecking his hard-earned artistic reputation. I for one am beginning to question the value of the David Lynch Brand."
1,Yes Lynch is trying to rip you off but its for a good cause,"You see Lynch cant be bothered with little trivialities like value for money or artistic integrity he's busy saving the world.Yes he has promised large amounts of cash to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi(yes the same guys the Beatles ran off to see). You see despite having billions in real estate and assets the Maharishi needs another billion to establish a 'peace center' where 8000 people will practice Trancendental meditation and create world peace. He has asked David Lynch, TM group member for his help in funding this project. Cant make up fiction like this folks.So when you see signed copies of Eraserhead for $90 on his pay website. Or $22 for 35 minutes of crude flash animation on Amazon. Dont worry its going to a good cause: world peace.Buy away!"
1,"a worse attrocity than 9/11, the Holocaust and the Hindenburg combined.","In the avant-guard style of the film, I present my views as a mechanism by which to challenge our preconcieved notions about the form and verbiage appropriate for artistic criticism.There is simply nothing to redeem this movie. The artistic sytle is repugnant even given that it was intentionally chosen to communicate a point. My dog creates better art in tightly coiled piles on the lawn.There is essentially no point to any of the ""episodes"" other than to make every waking second a living hell complete with a cacaphony of annoying, crudly done sound loops. IT sucks. Stay away Not even doom music justifies watching dumbland."
1,An almost complete flop...,"Look at the stats - on paper this baby is a screamer: fast, prodigious amounts of memory, CAS, upgradeable operating system and the list goes on. Pick it up and all of that falls away. 30 years of the best keys on the market and they try and wow us with color and cool new keys. You can no longer do quick calcs, you'll press the same number twice. The key force is at least twice what it was on the 48's and clumsy at best. This machine sits in my desk drawer as a backup. My trusty 48GX has been reinstated as my go-to guy."
4,Great calculator but bad user's guide,"The HP49G calculator is great after you figure out how to use it. I used to have a HP48G calculator. Before I order the HP49G, I thought that the HP49G is basically the same as HP 48G except with a few upgrade in features and better design. But it turns out not to be true at all. The default mode on the HP49G is totally different. The default mode is not RPN and the default is to display the menu in a list. I have to read the skimmy not-so-useful manual and think hard in order to figure out how to do simple things, like converting units and changing it back to RPN mode. However, the functionality of the calculator is great. I just wish the default mode is the same as the HP48G, so I don't have to read the manual on the first day to figure things out."
1,"If you love your 48G, you'll hate your 49G.","This one has soft rubber keys that you have to sit on to get them to register. If the key does register, sometimes it'll hang up and you can say ""Man, this calculator really stinks compared to my 48G"" before the number you entered even appears on the screen. The software is powerful (imaginary matrix algebra, anyone?), but the machine is a POS. The documentation is useless, and is divided into two books for even more torture! If dreams came true, the next HP calculator would have:- Body & keys like the 48G- A USB port- The functions of the 49G, but with a faster processor- ONE thick, well-written manual like the 48G- RPN ONLY!!!But dream on, because these are the days where high quality products are replaced with flimsy crap."
1,Extremely disappointing,"This entry from HP is no match for the 48 Series. The enclosed manuals are vaguely written. Case in point is converting units, or transposing one unit to another. Instead of small indicators at the bottom of the screen, like the 48 series,the HP 49 has pop-up displays which require much more time. It does look nice. but so do paperweights. If you need an advanced scientific calculator, look into the HP 48 series, or TI 86/89."
1,The worst of them all (how hp has lost its identity)!!!,"I'm a huge fan of hp calculators as a matter fact I've even started a collection of calculators. The real strenght of hp graphic calculator WAS the quality of the keyboard with the huge enter key, the RPN entry mode, the design and the huge power of computing and programming even tough the stack management is a little bit painfull at first. The HP48 is the real deal, the Rolls Royce AND the Farrari of all the calculators!!!!!!!!!!!The hp 49g has lost those qualities trying to be a poor TI wannabe. The screen is awfull you can't see properly, the keys are soft and VERY umprecise plus if you want to use the RPN entry mode you have to press too many keys at once!!! So my advice is stick with the hp48 series or buy a real TI instead!!!!!!!!"
1,The Edsel of HP calculators,"I've been a big fan of HP calculators after buying a 48SX about ten years ago. I've been using that one ever since. However, when I got a new job doing some statistical analysis about two years ago, I decided to treat myself by buying the latest version, the HP 49G.I was sadly disappointed. Even though the processor was much faster than my previous calculator, the GUI made using it much slower. Also, this was the first calculator I ever had which would actually CRASH. That's right, it CRASHES. There's a tiny reset button on the back you can press with a pushpin when this happens. This is completely unacceptable for a calculator.After about a week of using it, I sold it on an on-line auction site and bought the HP 48G in its place. I have both it and my 10-year old 48SX now, keeping one at work and the other at home. HP makes great calculators, EXCEPT for this model. Do yourself a favor and buy the 48G instead."
5,Great gift for a math student,Bought this for a girl who is starting on a path for advanced mathematics. She was thrilled with it.
1,I dont like it...MY opinion only...you may!,"Replacement for my old Sharp 1350...which I wish I hadn't drowned in coffee!The HP is slow at times with the simplest of calcs. I can sit back and wait for up to 5 odd seconds for the result of a simple addition to complete itself. Inputting numbers also can have a time lag. Many times I have re-input data only to find that the numbers suddenly appear.....twice!!Bottom line....Not at all confident with using this calculator and getting the right result.Rubber buttons....why????. Already rubber is getting furry on top and printed numbers wearing off. We are talking months here..not years!I really wish I'd taken this thing back the day after I'd bought it.ps I used to love my old HP67 from back in 1978, a dream to use, nice quality buttons, positive clicks."
2,HP49G,Screen is difficult to read--it's recessed too much. I've never had an HP calculator which miskeys as often as the HP49G. Sometimes performs the simplest calculations very slowly. About the only feature I really like is the unit conversion.
2,Not one of HP's best efforts,"I have been a big fan of HP calculators for nearly 25 years, and own a dozen or so HPs. The HP-49 is my least favorite of them, mainly because of the disappointing User's Guide. I've always been impressed with the documentation that comes with their calculators, but this one was far below their usual standards. I could hardly believe my eyes when I read, ""In line with Hewlett-Packard's environment policy--which, in part, aims to minimise the use of paper products--instructions on how to use the advanced functions of the HP49G are not included in this manual, but are published, instead, on the World Wide Web."" That's a pretty lame excuse for not printing a better manual. This may or may not be a great calculator--I really can't tell without some better documentation. I'm hoping some third-party author writes some thorough documentation for it. In the meantime, I would recommend the HP-48 instead of the 49."
2,Retiring My HP-49G,"My calculator Journey:7th-10th Grades: TI-8510th-12th Grades: TI-8912th-College: HP-49GLater in College: TI-89I thought I was upgrading from the TI-89 when I bought the HP-49G. NOT SO. The 89 is a faster calculator. I go insane waiting for the 49G to draw a graph. The 49G is slower than a snail, especially if you have the clock in the header. The 49G is a heap of minor annoyances that eventually drive you insane. I made the biggest mistake in my mathematics career when I sold my first 89 to my little brother. I bought the 49G. I now have another 89. The TI-89 is where it is at."
3,Very Bad Keyboard :-(,"I've had this calculator for 3 years now.This machine have a very bad keyboard, not only because are stuff, but also they are worse that the one in hp48GX.Please don't change what is perfect.The new case design does not represent a progress in my opinion, but it's ok.All the rest it's nice and a must have."
3,Style + All the Bells and Whistles,"The HP-49G is a big step up from my trusty HP-15 (and even older HP-35). In fact, it's more powerfull and has 8X the memory of the circa 1983, HP-87 desktop computer I use to run laboratory experiments.That said, I'm only giving it three stars because the display is too hard to read with my aging eyes. HP skimped on the quality of the LCD display, and it's hard for me to read the small characters and labels in less than optimal lighting. Outside on a sunny day, or in a well-lit office, the display is adequate.The keyboard is very busy, and some might find the number of alternate functions/choices per key overwhelming. In addition to the traditional RPN, HP now offers algebraic entry, and there is a powerful solver engine.Did HP over do it? From my perspective, I think so. This is one powerful calculator, but it tries to do too much with an inadequate screen and a cryptic keyboard layout."
3,Needs work,"Having used a 48GX throughout college and then in the real engineering world, I am a big fan of hp calc's. When my 48GX ""+"" key stopped working, I decided to get the 49. The first thing I noticed is the horrible keyboard. I mean it is almost unusable compared to the 48GX keyboard. I will probably dump it for that reason alone. Like the new styling and cover concept, but I've never had such a bad keyboard. It seems like you need a hammer to punch those keys. Please try again HP."
1,Don't expect any customer support!,"HP seems to be trying to put its retailers out of business, eliminate any customer support, and prevent access to the calculator ""guides"" which aren't manuals (or any use) any more. And the 49G's OS is full of bugs. That's too bad. I really wanted to purchase an HP calculator - I've had one since engineering school some 15 years ago - but now I'm going with TI. Awesome manuals, good customer support, no bugs, and a user-friendly interface. And there's plenty of stuff out there for download - engineering included. I'm now in the middle of getting a masters in Statistics. TI has a downloadable stats package, with pdf manual. This stats package can do much more than what the 49G has to offer (for example, generating random numbers from common distributions). What can you download from the HP site?? Just the connectivity software so you can download their latest OS, which you need to do since there are so many bugs."
2,A Clumsy Disapointment,"I've used HP's since the 41C, I will not use any other brand, but the 49G is not nearly as nice a machine as the other HP's. I let mine gather dust in my drawer and use an HP32S instead.With other HP's it may take a few days to get a feel for the keyboard, but once you get some practice the interface is very clean, well thought out, and a pleasure to use.The 49G feels clumsy and cheap, the keys are mushy, the keyboard layout sloppy, the display cluttered. It can do the job, but it is not fun to use.If you must have the advanced features you can probably overlook the clumsy feel, but if like me you use a desktop PC for most of the advanced jobs anyway then buy an HP32SII or other RPN calculator and it will do a better job for 1/3 the price."
3,Not one of HP's best efforts,"This was one of my primary calculators for years. Eventually the ""on/off"" button stopped responding and I threw the thing away. In my experience, the layout of this calculator is sub-par (can we have an oversized Enter key please?), it's slow, and the buttons are nowhere near the quality of those on my HP 17BII or HP48G. I sometimes see people people on eBay buying obsolete HP calculators because they've so fallen in love with a particular model that no modern replacement will do. I don't think any of those people are looking for HP49s."
3,A gift for a Friend,"I purchased this for a missionary friend in Uganda. It appears to be in good shape (book was used), and was requested by me friend, so I think he will be pleased by it."
4,Great for youth groups!,"Back when I was junior in High School at a Jesuit School, this was given to us as our Bible. Being young at the time, I just set it aside. I recently found it on my bookshelf and I do have to say its a great edition for the youth.I like the reading plan and the commentaries as part of the forward as well as each book.And, there are some funny paraphrases, like: ""John's disciples and the Jewish leaders sometimes fasted, that is, went without food as part of their religion."""
3,The Way - Contemporary Bible,"The Bible, filled with thou's, verily's, and all the language of old is sometimes a bit challenging to follow, if not read. With The Way, the writing is contemporary and thus easier to comprehend. I had a difficult time finding the book anywhere else but here. Thanks for a smooth sale."
3,Plum in the family,"Although Wodehouse writes funny even when he writes letters to friends and family, this collection does not really put him into new light, except perhaps a smaller part of his letters regarding his ""error"" whilst in german prison camp, when he spoke a comment on the Nazi Radio Broadcast (that soon afterwards was used by the Germans to broadcast to England as Nazi-propaganda). The rest is more or less forgettable. Better stick to his 99 books, there's more to laugh.Georg"
4,This guys possesed by a higher power or lower!,"""Scott H. Biram and the Dirty Old One Man Band"" the actual name almost kind of sums it up! he's pretty entertaining to say the least.If you took Hasil Adkins and Southern Culture on the skids and turned them into one individual, it would be Scott Biram.Straight ahead driving accoustic guitar and harmonica and gruff vocals singing about good old ""Whiskey"" and ""Downtown Chicken"" he can also tone it down and sound like a swell guy with ""Sweet Thing""Most of his work is redneck down and dirty and foot stompin (mostly his) his work is a must have."
3,Mixed bag,"I don't dislike this album but I probably skip more tracks here than on any of his other albums, including _This is Kingsbury_, which doesn't even play in my car stereo.There are better versions of a few of these songs on other albums (""Throw a Boogie"" on _Lo-Fi Mojo_, for instance). Biram's live performances tend to be frenetic and aimed more at keeping the alkies dancing than at doing justice to the music (although if you have not seen him live, go; it's impossible to describe unless you've seen it. But you'll understand why it's called the First Church of the Ultimate Fanaticism). I've seen and heard more than enough of him to know that when he's not trying to keep the audience whipped up, he's mesmerizing, which is something I would not say casually, but live recordings are probably not the best examples of his ability.Sadly, ""Sweet Thing"" is probably one of the better tracks musically, but it's a very poor quality recording."
2,Sorry. The emperor is not only NAKED - he's FLASHING.,"Okay. Really.This SHOULD have been a great album. Unfortunately, it sounds like a BOOTLEG of a BOOTLEG recorded live in a can of creme spinach on a cheap 1959 Japanese tape recorder.All is not lost however as a few cuts are relatively clear and distortion free and it is the PERFECT CD to put on for VISITORS who have OVERSTAYED THEIR WELCOME."
5,This is one you'll definently want in your collection,"I can't stress enough enough how kick ass this cd is.If you ever get a chance to see hime live,don't miss it.you won't be disappointed"
4,"Wife is happy. Well designed, looks good too","My wife has trouble with some jars. Who doesn't. This one will handle most jobs and save a lot of grunting. Good price. Attractive design. And I can't fault it in any way for a kitchen tool. Why suffer, buy one and see for yourself,"
3,Disappointing,"I own 5 other Windham Hill CDs and this was the first one that has disappointed me. The actual music was beautiful, but there was no list of performers...I have no idea who is performing each song. The only thing listed is ""Windham Hill Artists-Various"". The CD cost me almost $12 and I feel, for that price, I should have gotten some indication of who is performing the music."
5,A Winter's Solstice by Windham Hill,"I first heard this music in '88, and immediately bought the tape. It is hauntingly beautiful and has a depth and perspective seldom matched by any recordings I know. My dad died that same year the week before Christmas, and we played this at his memorial. It was unforgetable and will never leave those of us who shared in that moment. Usually, I'm a hard core rock and roller, but this represents an important digression and expansion of my personal tastes. I don't think many would be disappointed with what they hear."
5,"The best ""Solstice""","Windham Hill records has released about five ""Winter's Solstice"" albums that attempt to creat a somber mood of midwinter and sober reflection of the Holiday season. Of the five, the first one is the best because it contains a minimum of obvious holiday standards and because it creates the most somber mood. The music here, from various Windham Hill artists, is achingly beautiful. It is the type of music to curl up in front of a warm fire with a cup of hot cocoa and reflect on what it all means. This is a must have for fans of new age music."
5,Great During The Fall Season Too!,"Coupled with Volume 2, I find these two to be the best out of the whole set. Personally I enjoy the original compositions instead of all the remakes of the traditional holiday classics.To me, there is nothing better than listening to both 1+2 while driving through Vermont on a cold crisp Autumn day during the peak color season in October and then at night while in front of a fireplace. There is something so relaxing about them and they put you so in touch with life and the earth. They really make you glad to be alive!"
5,Excellent,I had this on casette but needed on disk. I play it every Dec 21st with some candles and an adult beverage. Knowing that finelly the days will be getting longer and spring will come once again
5,Indescribably Wonderful,"I own a gazillion CD's and if I had to choose only a handful that I could keep it would be this entire series of Winter Sostice selections , along with a CD called ""Blossoms In the Snow "" byRadhika Miller. I have loved them all so much that I have had to repace them several times because they are so loved . True musical bliss , NO MATTER the season . My only regret : that the artists have not continued the series . I wish there were more !"
1,I am impressed.. NOT!,"I have to laugh with Ron Rhodes lack of knowledge of the scriptures. It is a shame the majority of his arguments and so-called scriptural fact are indeed misrepresentations and incorrect reasoninga. He should have researched his topic a lot more and he would have written a completely different book. Also the comment about Jehovah Witnesses thinking that Jesus Christ is a ""mere angel"" was extremely laughable. Jesus Christ is considered God's Son. Much, much higher than a mere angel. I would rate a 0 star, but 1 is the lowest they allow. I do find it interesting that people find Jehovah Witnesses so much of a threat, that they must write books trying to contradict their beliefs. Hmmm I don't see the same of the Catholic church. I guess when you are teaching the truth, others just can't handle the truth."
1,Preach the good news of God's kingdom !!!,"What I find interesting is that you don't see JW writting material about other religions let along blasting these religions for their beliefs either. I am not one of JW, but my wife is and after 35 years of marriage I have not been brain washed, etc. In fact most of our friends respect my wife believes and more often say how wrong they were about JW once they truly find out what JW believe based on bible teachings. Also, JW are simply following Matthew 24:14 ""And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations will hear it; and then the end will come. This was a command from Jesus. We should always be respectful of others and pray for them so that they can come to accurate knowledge of God's purpose for mankind."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you use this book to ""Reason"" with ANYONE that knows the bible, you will still be made, in Ron Rhodes own words, a ""doctrinal pretzel"". It is so far off the mark of what the bible actually says that anyone you repeat these words to will just look at you with pity. If you really want to ""Reason from the Scriptures"" READ THEM for yourself and don't listen to ANYONE else that tries to tell you what it says."
4,"One of the best resources I've found, next to the Scriptures","I just spent three months meeting with a JW, along with 3 different JW's she brought at various times. I did not have this book when I started but wish I had it from the beginning. Verse by verse discussions assisted me greatly in pointing out contradictions the Watchtower has portrayed as truth.Mr. Rhodes' book was helpful in reminding me of how important the deity of Christ is to all of the principles of my belief as a Christian, and therefore, how critical to the misbeliefs of the JW's. My foundation is more solid because of my searching the scriptures with the help of Mr. Rhodes' book; the JW's foundation is crooked, but un-swayed, despite my pleas of intervention to the Holy Spirit.The JW's and I agreed not to meet again because of my unswerving belief in Christ's deity; I will continue to pray for each of them and to study Mr. Rhodes' book before another encounter with a JW."
1,Add on regarding the comment about Jesus is God.,"Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, why can't all this people professing to believe him just listen to him.When Jesus was about to die as a human being he cried to his God. Matthew 27:46, "".... My God My God why have you forsaken me?"" He prayed to his God why can't you.Jesus also told us how to pray. Our Father who art in heaven, hollowed be thy name.... Jesus never said to pray to him. In Jesus name we need to pray through him because of his ransom sacrifice but that's another story. Still though, you pray thourgh Jesus Christ **TO** his God and Father Jehovah.Don't waste your money on this book, read the Bible and find out what it says. Ron Rhodes can not bring you closer to God.If you are really curious ask Webster instead. Look up the name Jehovah in a dictionary."
1,Waste of time,"Having read the book I can tell you it is full of misrepresentations, distorted quotes and in general is a waste of time. Not a waste of time to a JW who can use it to show how people want to believe anything the read that is negative and don't bother to check out the information."
4,"Great and Thorough book, seems a bit much.","Awesome book, lots biblical examples that are willing to when go back to the Greek to really understand what words in scriptures really mean in their proper context. Sometimes it felt like it was just so much information I couldn't process it all, but that may be more of a ""me"" problem that a ""book"" problem. In depth analysis of the beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses and where they error in their understanding of the Jesus and God of history and the bible. Remember to love them, if you ever witness to the JW's, and just hold to what the non-mistranslated bible says :)"
1,Not leak-proof,"I used this tumbler for the first time this morning, and it leaked the coffee all over my white pants. No matter how tight I screwed the lid on, it still leaked like Niagara Falls. I never had such a problem with other tumblers."
3,Kindle Edition Does Not Contain Photos,"Jacob Riis produced some award-winning photographs of the Five Points slum, but these are not in the Kindle edition. I guess you get what you pay for, since the download is free. So, if you want the photos you will have to pay for the print edition, or get a download that you know contains these photos."
2,BIG,It is a lot bigger than what I thought. The pendant is about an inch long. Way too big for my liking. (That is NOT what she said... LOL)
2,$28 a pound?,"Is this price for one bag? At $27.95 a pound, wouldn't it be more cost-effective to pay a French chef to cut filet mignon into tiny bits?"
2,So-so reaction from a picky dog,"These were on sale at Petco, so we gave them a try. They're too big to give for frequent clicker treats with my 35 lb dog. (Cutting them in half is about right.)Even though they're heavily scented, they're just not her favorite. She'd rather have (3) Pounds of Lamb Lung (Baa Baa Q's) orDogswell Vitality Dog Treats, Chicken, 6-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)any day."
2,training bits,"Very expensive, I thought the bag was bigger. I'm better off getting it at my local pet store. I would get a bigger bag for the price."
2,So small,"I guess it's my fault for not understanding the amount in ounces, but I expected a larger package of treats. This one was enough for about a week."
2,My dogs didn't care about these,I bought these for training purposes but my dogs didn't really care for them. The size is perfect but it was just like giving them a piece of regular dog food.
5,Lab-Loves-It...,My dog can't get enough of it. It has a rich smell and the crinkle of the bag makes him know that it's trick time. I looked at the ingredients used and I'm happy knowing it doesn't have bi-products and uses whole filling. It has a soft texture and if you keep the bag closed the treat will stay moist. But my lab puppy has been trained off these and I'm very pleased with his reactions. I would recommend this product for people that want good treats at a value. I've order 5 bags with 2 more on the way.
3,our crazy dog train-me snacks,"I gave this product a 3 as our puppy enjoyed these but didn't seem crazy about them. The problem I had they had a sealable package but if you get any air in them they dry out! I would find some pieces that my puppy didn't finish and they would be hardened, I found that a couple of times, it seemed to me that the puppy didn't devour the snack. I wanted a snack for easy training and I would put them in my pocket for outdoor training, and like I said the puppy did eat them but didn't seem crazy for them. I did order the chicken and received the bacon but didn't return as I didn't want to go through that process and kept the bacon."
2,Disappointing,"When I purchase a ""lemon"" or ""lemon-lime"" mint or gum, I expect some level of sour, lemony-limey flavor! These have almost none! There is a faint lemon-lime flavor at first, and I mean FAINT but almost immediately they turn into a sugary-sweet powder on your tongue.There is absolutely ZERO relief from dry-mouth, they last for less than a minute and IF you pop several in your mouth hoping for better results, you'll have a clump of sweet sugar paste.Truly a disappointment! I really don't get the point of these little sweet powder drops!?The person who commented here on their strong flavor must be an employee of the Xyla company!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Very Weak and Short Lived,"Very little flavor and only last about 45 seconds in the mouth.What's the point of taking the mint if it does almost nothing.I was an sugar contained Altoids user for 9 years.I'm going to try these next: Eclipse Sugarfree Mints, and Spry Mints.Well, I've tried the Eclipse Sugarfree Mints and they are much stronger and last a lot longer. The Spry mints are somewhere in between the two."
2,Like being at the Mall,I am continually disappointed by the inflation of fans rankings. I purchased this CD based on reviewer's explantaion that it was in the class of Dark Side of the Moon. I guess its better than Yanni but what is that saying?
1,Very disappointed...,"Gave 2 as Xmas gifts thinking that ""assorted colors"" meant ""assorted colors"" (never opened individual shipping box). After opening Xmas morning they were 2 plastic cups with white paper with Starbucks green logo. Something you would expect as a give-a-way at a radio remote or a promotion day somewhere, not for sale! Very disapointed that Amazon & Starbucks is promoting this."
1,Disappointing product even it is free,"I got this for free during a promotion (buy coffee and get free mug). It is surprising that Starbucks and Amazon would use this poor thing as a promotional offer, and it is more surprising that its list price is almost $12. It looks cheap, feels cheap, is hard to clean, and the plastic is already scratched when it arrives."
3,Dragon Phoenix Pearl Tea,A friend of mine bought this from the store directly quite some time ago. I have enjoyed the flavor and aroma weekly ever since! The taste is mild and the aroma quite floral. If you enjoy tea that needs no added sweeteners this would be a great one for you.
1,Garbage,Title says it all. This Ice Cream Spade is pure garbage. I have used it a few times and the chrome started to peel.
1,Way too brief.,"If you plan to learn wing chun only from books then this book is a good introduction. However, if you are a wing chun student and you have a sifu then this book will not help you.The book covers each technique very briefly. It gives you just enough instruction to perform each technique and that is all.This book was written for wing chun outsiders."
1,I wish there was a no stars option,"This is without doubt the worst book I've ever read. All of the characters were despicable, the writing was mediocre at best, and the whole plotline was rather pointless. Pages and pages of empty sentiments mixed with pathetic symbolism compose this book, which I strongly advise anyone who reads this to avoid at all costs. I'm embarassed to live near the author."
4,Great price!,"Shipping was fast(they tell you it will be shipped for your planting season). I looked at nurseries for this plant and for the size, Michighan Bulb was the best deal anywhere!"
3,It was a zippo but not the one pictured,I ordered this one and I probably should have read closer or something because I got the silver one with the navy football logo instead it's cool but as soon as I opened it and didn't see the navy blue my heart sink haha oh well(perhaps a certain amazon seller could send me the right one free of charge?) besides the color is a perfect condition original box zippo no problems.
3,Interesting. Ties old myths to present day applications.,I found the book to be a difficult read. In order to fully understand the author's ideas you must bring with you a strong working knowledge of Celtic mythology. I found myself flipping back to previous chapters for reference. Overall the author had some interesting ideas to ponder. I especially liked how the author took the lessons taught from old myths and applied them to our daily lives. It was worth the read.
4,"A Good Overview, with Depth","Rabbi Leo Trepp z""1 was an accomplished rabbi and writer. He was born in Germany in 1913, and was forced to flee the country after the rise of the Nazis. He died at the age of 97 in 2010.In his The Complete Book of Jewish Observance, Rabbi Trepp introduces readers to Judaism, with an emphasis on halakah (although not to a rigorous degree) and keen attention drawn to the cycle of the seasons and Jewish holidays. Rabbi Trepp is quick to point out that Jewish holidays are always related to certain seasons. In this, he finds ""pagan"" antecedents to Jewish practice. But Judaism gives such holidays an added historical dimension. So, Passover has many images of Spring and the blooming of new life. At the same time, it is about the `historical' flight of the Jews from Egypt.This book might be hard to find, but it is worth reading. Rabbi Trepp provides a substantial overview of Judaism that adds depth and understanding for the curious reader."
5,My favorite CD *ever*,"I am buying this to replace a CD that I literally wore out. This is really beautiful music - happy, mellow and great for setting a mood. It helps me focus on my work, it's great background music for enjoying a bottle of wine, and I plan to have it playing when I go into labor with my first baby. I love it!"
3,Great music --- Average recording quality,"This CD contains some of Govi's better material; upbeat songs that are well played and sure to make the listener feel good. However, the sound of this recording is somewhat tinny and compressed; not close to the high quality level of Govi's later releases. If played on a boombox or low end system this should not present a problem but if you are listening to this CD on an audiophile or a good mid-fi system, the faults of this recording are readily apparent. I would really like to see Govi re-record the songs of this CD using his present day top notch equipment.George M -- Phx."
4,"Good, direct advice on hunting elk","This book is an anomaly - Wixom gives clear instructions on elk hunting techniques in various situations. Contrasts with most books, which qualify every assertion with myriad exceptions, which simply undermines the purpose of giving advice in the first place. Some of the book is outdated, but the advice on methods is so concise and informative that it contains a lot more information than other wordier texts.One weakness is the authors understanding of ballistics, but I've found a lot of skilled hunters don't have a lot of knowledge in this area. The guys who concentrate on guns to the point of obsession are usually shooters, not so much hunters. There's enough specialized material available elsewhere on this subject that the book would have been well served to leave it out."
3,Very predictable,"Did not live up to the blurb on the front - did not even touch the surface of the moral issues involved in the conviction of war criminals. It was also predictable. However, it was a good read and only disappointing if you expect some deeper social comment, which I did."
2,"I was hoping for a well-written page-turner, but...","After hearing a very favorable review on NPR, I put The Statement on the top of my reading list. So, I was very disappointed to figure out the end before I had finished the first 25 pages. The plot held promise but Moore delivered it with leaden prose. Brossard's thoughts, repeated throughout the book, offered little insight (he didn't want to get caught, etc.) and the characters were drawn with minimal strokes.I laughed at the lone scene of brief nudity in the book. It seems as if it were inserted solely for the purpose of eliciting a blurb like ""...a sexy, taut thriller, blah blah blah""."
1,Predictable and that's just the problem,"When you read a book that seems predictable,you expect to be proved wrong by a credible surprise ending. Moore truly disappoints because there is no surprise. What you suspect will happen is exactly what happens. To worsen matters,the reader never sees the other guilty parties brought to justice. You learn about them early on, but they never appear in the context of the plot. Ugh!One reviewer said that this would have been a better non-fiction work.I agree. He tells us much about collusion by the Church with the Vichy government during WWII. Moore didn't need to write a predictable novel to educate readers about this history"
1,just another preacher story lacking suspense or any interest,"A guy is sheltered by the catholic church after killing 14 Jews during the WWII, moving from monastery to monastery for 40 years. Painted as a cold blooded killer, he is so devoid of stamina and life, his character reads like an empty bubble. After him are just as unsympathetic Jewish assassins bent on bringing justice... eye for an eye, by killing the monster. Only, I can't quite figure out whom to sympathize with. A killer is a killer. Boring, poorly written, another preacher story. Perhaps am skewed after reading a nonfiction story several weeks ago about Nazis rounding up whole blocks of poles and russians and shooting people on the spot. This one would have been more interesting as a non fiction account provided it was written based on solid research."
2,"It was good, until it broke (too).","""Did a good job pressing the garlic, until it broke where the plastic met the chrome on the handle."" Exact thing happened to me. I liked the free swinging piston over a deep cylinder for the garlic instead of the traditional ""triangle on a hinge."" The grips were comfortable, and I could press a lot of garlic quickly. Cleaning was easy until the pins in the cleaner get bent. 4 or 5 stars if the handles were metal or at least had a ""full tang"" bolt running through them."
3,"Here for a good time, not a long time!","We got this garlic press probably in 2003 - Last night it broke on me. As others have mentioned, with the plastic handle snapping off (not in a violent manner, it just ended up meeting it's friend at the back when my garlic was pressed, then fell off when I put it down)Since I use it approximately every 1-2 months for several cloves at a time, it was a very convenient gadget, cleaned up easily and stored easily, but the design is flawed. If I was pressing garlic multiple times per week as many foodies do, I do not imagine it would have lasted more than a year."
1,Poorly designed,"As with many of the other reviewers my handle broke. On the first clove pressed I heard a cracking noise and it worked fine for the rest of the bunch, about a dozen cloves. When I washed it it fell apart in the sink.The metal shaft is that is embedded in injection molded plastic is too short. If this was lengthened an inch or more this problem would probably be corrected."
4,good but not the best,the garlic comes out in two directions when I press the garlic press... front and the edge of the back....
2,"It was good, until it broke.","Did a good job pressing the garlic, until it broke where the plastic met the chrome on the handle. Use caution."
1,looks sturdy - isn't,"Given as a gift, the handle broke as mentioned by other folks. I wrote to kitchenaid, and they graciously replaced it... with the same flawed design. Broken again. Now I'm hear shopping for a decent, solid garlic press. Could potentially be dangerous."
3,Pretty good press...until it broke,"Like a previous poster, it worked fine until the handle broke. I would say I am a stronger than average woman, but I am no body builder. Was great and then the plastic portion where it meets the metal portion on the top snapped.Disappointed, I have to say. I am sure I could get it replaced, but I need something more sturdy. I will have to try the one the previous poster suggested."
3,NOT Win 7,"Whilst the content is pretty fair, if you bought this item and upgraded to WIn 7 you will be dissapointed. It is possible to put the clips onto a hard drive, but the search faciltity doesn't work in Win7 which makes it almost impossible to find what you're looking for without spending ages going through them. I'd love to have a work-round for this. If I don't find one I'll wipe all IMSI clips off and buy another batch elsewhere. Pity!"
3,Stroller decent but had to return it,"I purchased the Summer Infant QuickSmart Stroller for a trip. My guess is that most people who are interested in this stroller buy it for the ability to travel on airplanes with it. The problem is that LxWxH measures about 52"". The plane limitation for my trip was 45"". Thus, it exceeded the maximum volume requirement. I called the Company and the person who picked up the phone could not confirm that it would fit in airplane overhead bins. The stoller itself seems like a great design; however, the bag is so flimsy, it basically cannot be used. Unfortunately, I purchased the stroller to fit in an overhead airplane bin and based on the failure to fit in overhead bins, along with the poorly constructed bag, forced me to return the item. Amazon.com was excellent and credited my account for the return."
3,Compact but could be better,"I got this when my daughter was less than a year old. It DOES fold down into a tidy, compact form that fit on the floor behind the seat in my car. The color was cute, the custom rain cover was great. I was, however, disappointed in way it handled when there was a child in it. Empty, it turns on a dime and rolls great. Put even a 6-month old baby in there, however, and you really lose a lot of that. The carry bin on the bottom is also amazingly small, and because of the way the frame folds, you really shouldn't put a bag on the handle. (Yes, I realize that's not technically recommended anyway, but honestly, how many of us do it anyway!) The direction of the frame joint just made putting a bag on the stroller seem shady, and you're certainly not fitting it into the cargo sling, so be prepared to carry your diaper bag."
1,Doesn't make you sweat - too easy,"This workout, to me, seems geared toward kids even younger than teens. The workout was way too easy that I think middle school kids would benefit more.Everything seemed in slow motion, and you do not sweat. There's no cardio element. You kind of stop and start, and the instructor's movements are so slow that I needed to go even faster and not follow what she was doing.I'm in my mid 20s, but I don't think teenagers would like this."
1,"TITLE? How about ""Worst Product I Have Ever Used.""","This is one of the worst products I have ever used. It gives you no detailed instructions for ironing on, like how long you are supposed to do it; it just says ""iron the transfer onto light fabric."" It ruined the brand new white tank top I bought for this project...and left me angry and frustrated. I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option! Phone # on package, but you end up with an answering machine, and I did find in very small print (that you aren't looking for when shopping) it does say, ""We shall not be responsible for incidental or consequential damages related to the use of this product."" I guess that says it all, doesn't it?"
2,"Not the best, but okay if you can't find ""Printworks""","""Invent It!"" transfer paper works (kinda) if you follow the instructions exactly, and you don't have very high standards for the finished product. We finally used up our last package of this stuff on some ""throw-away"" tee shirts after 6 years of experience with it. The reason we hold it in such low esteem is because we also bought ""Printworks"" transfer paper (from Burlington) at the same time as the Invent It! paper and found that the Printworks paper transfered much easier, had better clarity and color, and has worn much better over the years. Amazon sells both, so we have always re-ordered the Printworks product.Iron-on transfers are never as good as silkscreened shirts, but if you are going to use transfers you may as well use the best products out there, and this stuff doesn't make the cut."
2,Not an ideal fit,"My 1998 (mint condition) Accord EX V6 needed new driver side lower ball joints and control arm so I decided to give AC Delco a try for the ball joints. After my mechanic (who I have trusted for many years) installed it I noticed a persistent clunking sound whenever I made a hard left or left U-turn. When I brought it back to my mechanic we noticed that the ball joint's base was thicker than the original and was coming in contact with my CV joint (and has worn it down significantly) whenever I had my wheel turned fully to the left. He kindly replaced the metal clamp on my CV joint but the noise still persists. I will probably consider original parts in the future. Best advice for all is to find a trustworthy mechanic (this takes knowledge, patience, and luck) and ask him/her which parts can be after market versus which parts should be original."

5,more exclusive remixes and long versions...,"First, get past the fact that there's yet another take on ""you gotta believe in something, why not believe in me"" starting off this disc. Ugh. If any DJ thinks that sample never gets old, they're wrong. Please, no more. Anyway, what follows is pure Junior peak hour bliss, diva anthems, classic junior remix sounds, some exclusive mixes, and a couple of long versions. Track times are:1. you gotta believe (8:09)2.

5,Do you know what an apple is?,"Do you know what an apple is? If so, then you are against abortion. The book fills in the details in fourteen steps.Kreeft has a gift for wit, wisdom, logical swordplay, and the ability to make learning fun. This is a book that you can read in two hours, but will leave you thinking for life."
4,Crafts N Things Takes On Too Much,"Amos Publishing recently purchased Rubber Stamper Magazine, and includes an expanded section of rubber stamping in their existing Crafts `N Things Magazine. Despite the wonderful rubber stamping pages included within February's issue, if you are looking specifically for rubber stamping techniques and ideas, Crafts `N Things is not best place to look. While the cover claims that there are over seventy five rubber stamping ideas within the magazine, the other half of the magazine covers knitting, crocheting, and other crafts.The magazine is beautiful with fun projects, but the projects covered are too diverse. Even though Rubber Stampers are crafters, they are not always crocheters or knitters. I found only half of the magazine useful for my needs, and would prefer a magazine that covered more specifically the craft that I am interested in."
2,Again item not recieved,"Another magazine subscription not recieved, probably not ordering it consistant with the company's publishing times. Another gift for dear ole Mom!!"
2,What's the story Mike?,"My, isn't he just the sophisticated mellow gent in leisure slacks. Has Michael Palin, the former Monty Python anarchist finally sold out or is it just his mid-life crisis? Is biting satire dead, only to be replaced by conservative acquiessence?Ripping yarns turned 180 degrees? Surely not?"
5,Great Armchair Travelling!,"Once again, Michael Palin takes his viewers on a hilarious yet insightful trip. This segment from his series on a grand tour of the Pacific Rim provides wonderful glimpses of the complexities of Chilean society and politics against the back drop of that nation's spectacular scenery. The trans-Andean railroad/bus trip to Bolivia is funny but clearly demonstrates the stark contrast between Chile and its poorer neighbor Bolivia. Overall, this is a great episode of an outstanding program. Bravo to Palin! He's done it again. This is a must see for the armchair traveller or those who like the real thing!"
3,Okay,"Somewhat interesting. There were places I had not seen on a travel tape before which was nice and the reason I purchased it. I am always tempted to buy the older travel shows in hopes of seeing something that has not been shown on the newer travel shows. Mr. Palin reminds me of Ian Cross of the Globe Trekkers. Always willing to try and is always polite although tongue in cheek sometimes. I will not be tempted to buy any more of Mr Palin's travel tapes, they're just not that good."
1,"15+ years of hunter products, this one sucks","i have 8 hunter ceiling fans in my house, and due to them all having seen their fare share of use and old age started replacing them, i bought a hunter beacon 42"" 2 weeks ago- awesome fan. bought this one for a larger room. i have installed all of these fans btw. now i have remotes on most of my fans, but the remote receiver that came with this one is huge, and doesnt even fit in the way they designed it- you have to remove the ground screw from the bracket- found this out after much headache- then after finaly getting it up the friggin motor started humming an hour later.. @$#@$@#$@#$%^&**$*$ the bracket that mounts this one to the ceiling vs the beacon is so cheap, everything about this fan feels like bad engineering. thats just the opinion of someone who takes apart $200,000 dollar cars for a living. hunter will be getting a phone call for a needed exchange in the morning"
4,"Typical (great) Hunter quality, excellent value","As is typical with Hunter fans this one is quiet in operation and looks great. It includes the remote control unit which would run $40 to purchase separately and as such is a great value.My only issue was that the transmitter for the remote was very difficult to fit into the unit. We had to maneuver everything just so, to get it under the cover and close things up. Other than that, it's great.Our last Hunter fan lasted 20 years in this location, running on low 24/7, and I expect this fan to do the same."
3,For a Hunter not great,"I love the fan now that it is installed! I put the fan in and the light wouldn't turn on...had to pay an electrician to say that the transmitter was faulty. Then, had to call Hunter and wait 10 days for the part to come in to install it. Installed it the second time myself and the light works and the fan is quiet. However, I have noticed that the fan turns on and off by itself. How I don't know.(We don't have any other remote control fans in the house). I will have it on low and all of a sudden it will go faster to the high speed. Or have it on before I leave in the morning and come home for lunch and it is off. I know that I am not doing it because the remote is mounted to the wall to where it can't accidentally be hit. So I have become aware if the fan is not on, because I have had it on low since we installed it."
1,Does not make you want to dance.,"This music is supposed to be for ballroom dancing, but I don't think any of it is danceable. The tempo and rhythm are there, and sambas are recognizable as sambas, and paso dobles are paso dobles, but the character isn't in the music. I think this CD is more appropriate in the elevator or in a lounge where you could drink a cup of tea, read newspaper, and think how to waste the rest of the afternoon.Not one of the tracks on this CD made me feel like I want to dance. Cha-chas were especially horrible."
4,"Good, but get the 'Spade' instead","My mother-in-law has this Kitchen Aid ""scoop"" version. It's good, but not as good as the ""spade"" version. I give it 4 stars by comparison. If you must have round ice cream balls for an ice cream cone, then you could get this, however the spade works much better for scooping ice cream, cutting through easily and scooping plenty. You could still make a ""ball"" if you really wanted to with the spade.I've had my Kitchen Aid Spade for 2 years. It is THE best ice cream scoop(spade) ever. No matter how cold or hard the icecream/yogurt is, the spade cuts right through.These Kitchen Aid ""scoops"" or ""spades"" are better than the types with anti-freeze type liquid which supposedly helps. Don't bother -- these Kitchen Aid scoops cut through anything. The handle is perfect, and the whole thing is well-balanced (for both the spade and scoop).5 stars for the Spade, 4 stars for the Scoop. I'd even pay twice as much for the Kitchen Aid Spade if required."
5,One of the best insulated cups available!!,"I have purchased at least 10 other stainless tumblers and they can't even come close to this one!! It is the best insulated tumbler I could find! and believe me, after approx. $200.00 in ""trying just one more cup"", I recommend this tumbler whole-heartedly!! It is the best one out there!!!"
1,Disappointed in this Starbucks Product,"I decided to purchase this travel mug because of the Starbucks reputation for quality. However, this is one of the cheapest travel mugs I have used. The rubber grip came apart and fell off the mug after the first wash -- I didn't even get to use it. I am returning it.There are better travel coffee mugs for less money out there. Don't waste your time with this one. It costs too much money to fall apart before it can even be used."
5,delightful lobel story....,"this funny, sad, and thoughtful story of a little elephant who loses his parents in ship wreck is a great book to talk with your young children about loss and family. Little Elephant must go to stay with his Uncle. Many adventures ensue, as well as lil elephants understanding of older folks. A surprise awaits lil elephant and the end and you'll find yourself shedding a tear for good old Uncle Elephant.Good for boys or girls-up to about 8 years.5 stars!"
2,Leaks,"This looks like it will be very easy to operate if we can ever get it to stop leaking between the hose and the sprayer. One or two o-rings should have been supplied by the manufacturer for this purchase. Hopefully we will be able to find one in a hardware store, but it shouldn't be necessary."
1,indoor hose,i purchased this product to water plants on my patio. it was supposeto attach to your kitchen faucet. never did i search and searched foran attachment nowhere could i find one. e-mail the company it originallycame from no reply. this was a total loss! don't purchase this product!purchased it through amazon.
1,not satisfied,Broke during first try. The hose broke off. I liked the concept but ended up throwing in trash. Not happy. Wish to find similar hose that would work from kitchen faucet to my deck. Any suggestions
1,Lousy Merchandise,I seldom have any problem with anything purchased at Amazon but this item istotal junk. It does not fit any faucet in my house. Have made multiple trips tohardware store and have yet to find an adapter for this thing. Don't waste your money on this thing. [...]
1,POOR QUALITY,"It was great while it lasted (about 4-5 days). I got this to wash my dog's feet before she comes in the house. It connected to my faucet without problems, yes it leaked but I was ok with that, afterall it goes into the sink. BUT then, the handle split down the middle...Tried to replace it at Lowes, couldn't, so I glued and taped it...That lasted 2 days and it split again...Then it came apart at the other end where it goes to the faucet. The hose popped out and there is no putting it back in...Basically I paid $15 to wash my dog's feet for about 5 days..."
1,Should come with adapters,"Tried every sink in my house, and it didn't attach to any of them. Product should really come with several adapters (mine didn't come with *any*) to attach to different sinks. Good idea, poor execution."
1,Leaky Hose,This is the first time I was unhappy with a purchase from Amazon. The hose connections leak at both ends. It is clearly a poor knock-off of the original. I am sorry that I bought it but use in infrequently so I did not bother with the hassle of returning it. I just will never purchase anything else from that company. I have purchased other things from other companys over the years and been pleased.
1,Piece of garbage; don't waste your money.,"When I hooked this thing up, water sprayed all over the place. When I tried to tighten it up the hose came loose from the fitting."
2,Cumbersome hose,"The picture gives the impression the hose is a flexible medium size hose when in fact, it is thicker than a garden hose and very tough to maneuver.It comes coiled and hard to uncoil. It doesnt come with the different faucet attachments you need to buy and the heavy hose is tough on you draggining it thru your home. Not satisfied with this at all."
3,It Looks Easy.,"I had to go to a plumbing supply store for 2 additional attachments for the hose to fit my kitchen faucet. The hose would've fit easily if it were being attached to the pipe in the bathroom instead of the shower head. Once the adaptation was complete, I was able to use the hose without incident. I could've used a regular garden hose and hand spray with less of a headache."
2,Indoor hose,"I cannot rate this product because this hose does not fit any of my indoor faucets. We are in the process of trying to find an adaptor, but as yet have not been able to."
3,Hope it works,"We purchased this after finding it some time after we had needed it. We've not had an opportunity to use it, but are glad to have if for when that time arises. For that reason we can not give it more than three stars since we don't know how well it really works. We did have to go buy an additional fitting, since it did not have one that would work with what we consider to be a normal sink fitting."
3,can't use yet,"I bought it, it looks good, but when I tried to hook up it leaks from the faucet. I guess I might need another washer, but I really want a quick connect adapter for it so for now it sits unused and awaiting something to make it function corectly."
2,Indoor Hose,"I found the indoor hose hard to work with. The adapter that was sent with it did not fit my faucet. After buying another adapter to use on the hose it starting leaking and also leaks at the sprayer end. So my hands,shoes and pants get wet.Not happy with the product at all."
2,Add one more complaint for bad sink connection,"I did not heed the warning about the bad connections left by other reviewers so I now I join them in complaining. To connect to an indoor sink faucet requires an additional adapter of some sort either to use the outdoor hose version (which seems to be tight enough)or replace the indoor version that is included. Big time leaks, more than can be ignored. Do not recommend unless you intend to connect to an outdoor faucet which of course defeats the purpose. And yes I tried all sorts of washer combinations."
2,Not as shown,The hose is clearly shown to be attached to the kitchen sink but in reality the coupling is for a garden hose.The spray lever is very hard to operate and my wife has had lots of trouble depressing the lever.
3,Quality is not perfect.,The seal between the gun and the hose is insufficient. Mine leaks so badly that I will have to install a new seal or modify the plastic gun itself. Otherwise there are three different adaptors for the faucet and these are good quality.
