5,Love the ladybug,"1st birthday present, a little big for her right now, but will be able to use it for several years. Cute and well built"
5,Cutest riding toy!,"My daughter got this for Christmas, she just turned 1 year old, weighs 21 pounds, and is in the 95th percentile for height. She can sit on it, but not by herself yet, she likes to push it around by the handle and take steps. It will be a few more months yet before she can ride it by herself. The toy is so adorable and I know she will enjoy riding it for a long time. I also got the large bug for her."
5,Awesome gift for little ones!,I bought the large wheely bug for my 14 month old and she LOVES it. The wheels are similar to the ones on office chairs which gives it a nice smooth ride that handles turns well. My 5 year old son has as much fun on it as she does and it has been a big hit in our house.
5,These are fantastic toys!,I first saw these at a local indoor play place and fell in love with them! Now my 12 month old got one for his birthday and he can already scoot around on it. (He is 99% for height) My three year old loves it but I had better get him the larger size before this one gets worn out!
3,Wheely pig,"We got this for our daughters 1 st birthday. It is really cute, but it tips easily. It might be better when she gets a little older."
4,long live Arlo,"As good an album as this is, if you're buying anything by Arlo you gotta make sure you have one with Alice's Resturaunt on it. Arlo's classic, trademark 26(?) minute song. Anyway, I don't know that much about folk music (I like Bob Dylan but thats about as folk as I get) but I will tell you that I like this album. Just a touch of country but not too twangy or anything like that. A ""lay-in-a-field-on-a-summers-day"" type of album."
5,Good CD,Purchased for my wife for xmas and she said it has a very good selection of songs and the right amount.
4,Great Arlo album,"I personally enjoyed this album of Arlo's and so did every body else in my family. And of course it has Arlo's incredible version of ""City Of New Orleans."" I recommend it!"
3,A great movie but......,"I am very disapointted with the DVD. For one thing it said on the box ""Format: Closed-captioned"" yet it did not have CC at all. Also I did not like the fact that the movie was edited so whenever there was a ""bad"" word there was no sound at all. Why would anyone edit out things in such a wonderful movie like this is beyond me."
2,Flounders in The Shallows,"This movie starts out with an interesting premise and good intentions, but something, nope, a lot, is missing. Joe Flannigan is always a treat, although he is still maturing as an actor. William Hall Jr. is a good actor, but did not have the Morgan Freeman gravitas to pull off this role. Nor was his character well written. He is the clearest-headed alcoholic ever seen on the screen. All of the principals are about the same age and that's a problem. The Harry character is just too young and so is everyone else who is supposed to be his peer. They didn't even try makeup to suggest age. The surrealism of this community acting bee consistently undermines any tension. I kept expecting Dorothy and Toto to show up. Every character except for the two leads is about as cardboard cut out as they come. The narration is too much by half. I hope the good people of Bainbridge Island (where this was filmed) can forget this and move on with their lives."
5,Farewell To Harry,This was an enjoyable movie to watch - a bittersweet movie about two people who become friends and share life together.
3,DONT PAY TO MUCH,"PRETTY GOOD CD,REDONE SONGS LIVE AND SUCH,LATER RECORDINGS.....BUT DON'T PAY TO MUCH."
1,bad odor,"I wish to say that the perfume in the ""new"" Pantene products is HORRIBLE!!! Iloved your two-in-one shampoo-conditioner--cannot use this new stuff--it STINKS!!! Literally."
1,New Pantene Smells Terrible,I could not agree more with the two previous posts. I am sick of scouring every discount store in town to find the old products. The amino acids that supposedly differentiate the new from the old resulted in no change to my hair - just that I smelled like a fruitcake.
1,The new Formula is terrible,"I agree with the previous post. The new formula has a horrible aroma and is no good. The previous formula was great, I don't know why they changed it."
2,Disappointed,"Be warned, this does not fit all triton routers without some modification. I bought this adaptor to go with the Triton MOF001C 2 1/4 Hp router, mounted in a router table. It does fit onto the router, but not properly. The screw pattern lines up with the base plate but you will have to drill at least 1 hole to be able to use the above the table depth winder. If you want to use this with the template adapter mounts you will have to drill another 2 holes to access them.Why do you even need an adapter plate? The porter cable style bushing system should be standard for all routers. Shame on Triton for an obvious cash grab."
1,This Is A Novel - Not A Book That Offers Insights On Indigos,"Boy was I more than a little upset that this book was a total waste of my time. I read NONFICTION. If I wanted a fictional book, a NOVEL, where the characters were SUPPOSED to be Indigo, then I would buy FANTASY.I was looking for FACT.That alone helped me discredit this series of writings, obviously using the Indigo name in the title due to the increased interest in Indigos.I think that reviews should state, clearly, that this is a NOVEL (fiction). That alone would have saved me the money I spent on it, and could have spent on another book.Another deception..."
2,"Cheesy, lame, slow let-down.","I concur with Education Advocate's assessment of this software. I, too, gambled on this product since it was cheap - further proof positive that you get what you pay for, I suppose. My kiddo was instantly bored and the interface is so babyish compared to this age group's slick high-tech interests that I wish I had saved my change and bought something different."
3,"Great cut, pray it holds together!","I bought an MK101 and 2 blades. Cuts granite tiles nicely. I was very pleased! For a few hours... After making several cuts to get acquainted, I tried changing blades. Blade changes are not easy and they are even tougher when the blade lock pin jams, breaks, and then pops out. The blade lock mechanism is cheaply made. I found the customer service terrible and helpless. I cannot find a service center in San Diego county. The company itself has given be several numbers, and everyone I call replys that they do not service MK Diamond. I am sorry I bought this saw and will not buy another MK Diamond product. This is terrible quality and service for an $800 saw."
1,The motor is perhaps made in the USA and everything else is made in china,"I bought the 151991 MK-101 1.5 Horsepower 10"" Tile Saw and when I opened the box, right away I recognized the poor quality of the support components, guide bar and cutting guide. The markings on the cutting guide are not precise and looks like someone slap paint and make random markings on it. The cutting guide looks the same like the Mk 370 ""made in china"" that I returned recently. I did not want to spend time assemble the saw because it reminded me of the bad experience I had with the MK 370. Waist of my time and now I have to go return it. Now that I'm certain, I will not buy another MK product again. It's not made in the U.S.A. and I'm hoping the MK guys are proud of what they are doing."
1,Soviet Tanks in Combat 1941-1945,Half the book is bound upside down with numerous pages cut off. The book doesn't cover all the material indicated in the title. Overall a very disapointing book.
2,It didn't work,"After troubleshooting this radio, I found that the ceramic earphone was defective. It would have been a great buy if the earphone worked. I had to order a replacement earphone at a cost which was almost as much as the cost of this radio lab kit."
1,Useless,We ordered this product with great excitement. The kids put it together. Then I tried putting it together. Then my husband tried putting it together. There was nothing we could do to get this product to receive a signal. It was really a waste of money.
1,Doesn't work,I bought this kit for my 14 year old daughter to use for school science fair.It does not work. The instructions are less than helpful .There needs to be more diagrams.Since it failed she now has 12 hours to come up with a new science fair project.I feel very bad for her .
5,A Great Children's Book,"Ms. Stern has written a beautiful book explaining the essence of diabetes to a child. The book is enhanced by Ms. Orland's illustrations. I have had diabetic friends read this book, and they all tell me they approve of it greatly. This is a disease that I had never heard of until I was twelve, and did not really understand until I was in high school. I wish this book had been around a few decades earlier."
2,Average at best,"this is the kind of song that Teddy Riley could Produce in His Sleep&it shows.""Girlfriend-Boyfriend"" duet with Janet Jackson was just ok to me.""Take Me there"" just felt there for me as well."
3,A bit scary but very good,"A Night in Terror TOWER (Not TOWN) is a very good video. I have watched it with Mum and Richard loads of times. I liked the bit where the Gost on terror tower said, ""Go back,Go back"" I liked the way you thought they lost their memories but they didn't, they were just in a different time."
5,You'll come with me to terror tower.,"When i started renting these movies when i was little they scared so much i remember when i last watched ""the haunted mask 2"" i had to hide in the corner. this episode is really cool i can't believe they went to the ancient times sorry can't tell any more you have to see it. It's better to get a used vhs because it cost less and they last longer bye."
2,NOT SCARY.,"The book is scarier than the video. I thought it was supposed to be the other way around. Not really many of these videos are horror or scary, they are supernatural. I think the kids did a good job acting, the BEHIND-THE-SCENES bit was okay, but all in all I wouldn't buy it - don't rush into it, guys."
1,Boring,"My son who just turned 6 and is a big fan of Goosebumps and similar spooky movies, disliked this video the most of all the Goosebumps series. I bought it thinking it had a good story, but he complained it wasn't interesting and there was nothing scary in it. By contrast, he loved the Night of the Living Dummy and Bride of the Living Dummy movies, as well as the Haunted Mask videos. Might be good if your child is apprehensive about spooky movies, but if your child is a seasoned kid-themed creepy movie fan, he/she may be disappointed."
2,"Okay, but not the best!",I had the belt clip holster for a few weeks when I was answering my phone. The clip could not release the phone and the top part broke off. I am currently looking to get a replacement. Wait and see! Also the clip does not lock the flip phone in place. The original holster does. I was disappointed to see this one did not.
3,"It is plastic and it broke, of course","They say 4"" and they are right, but you forget that when you put it to use. I used it to hold a 2x12 stringer against a 4x4 post (that is about 5"") so that I could mark the stringer for cutting. The clamp snapped in two. I knew better; plastic does not and cannot replace a real clamp."
5,"Elegant, strong, gorgeous","I was looking for everyday dishes that could double for formal meals as well, and Misaka HK 400 Antique White fit the bill. I love these dishes. They are strong, fine pocelain. They do not chip and are oven and microwave safe."
1,INACCURATE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"The item is not correctly described. It actually includes four blades, all 7-1/4 in diameter. There are no 7 in blades included.I have an old Craftsman circular saw that takes 7 in. blades (7-1/4 in blades are to large) and had expected to use two of the blades in that saw."
4,Great Blades,I have many Skil products. I bought a skil saw along with this blade set. The blades give you a wide range of cutting surfaces in a single case. It's nice to put all of the blades into my tool bag and not worry about dinging up the blades or any other tools. It's a great set to take anywhere to allow you to cut multiple surfaces. The blades are made well for the price. You can't go wrong buying this set. It's always nice to have a blade in case you need it.
4,saw blade review,I have not used any of the contents in the package. They appear to be a great use to me in the future.
4,Eases neck strain for my old dog,"I always looked at these products and wondered why anyone would need them over just a dog dish or water bowl. Well, my miniature poodle is about 14 now and she definitely likes having her dishes just a little higher. It seems to take the strain off her neck and back. I've also noticed less stomach upset from her since we started using this, most likely because her head isn't at the floor level and is in better alignment with ingesting and digesting her food, while swallowing less air.Is this something that every pet owner needs? Probably not, but it has helped our dog be more comfortable and have fewer digestive issues, so I'd recommend it for that. I do need to fill the water bowl about 3 times a day compared to her older, larger bowl. And, it would be great to get an extra set of replacement bowls so I could have a set in the holder while the others are in the dishwasher. But, overall, very pleased with the product, quality and cost."
4,Cheap and effective.,Except for the plastic parts not sticking together very well (they're always loose when I pick it up for washing) I like this bowl system a great deal. The little tray around the bowls is great for catching crumbs and one of my cats loves to drag pieces of food up to it and then eat them from there. It washes easily and the supplied stainless steel bowls are acceptable quality. The height for eating is also great for cats of all ages (excepting possibly very young kittens). I recommend this product.
3,Very Cute... Compact..,I ordered this for my kitten and I am satisfied with its functionality and ability to be cleaned easily. The problem is the side panels keep sliding down... this makes the set look cheap and not to mention gets a little annoying to keep trying to slide it back up.
4,Sorry I couldn't give it 5 stars,"I purchased two of these for my cats who have no problems eating from them. I can't say there is much difference between these and what I used before. They are much nicer to look at and blend in with the decor better. My only problem is I can't find replacement bowls. So, when these are being washed there is nothing for my cats."
4,Great dishes,I love these dishes. They can hold food or water and greatly reduce spilling of Pet food. Looks organized and clean.
3,Just okay,"Shipping was very fast!! Received item a day after ordering. Looks very stylish however, the bowls are incredibly small and I need to keep refilling them several times throughout the day."
3,nice but not puppy proof,"i like this product but it isn't puppy proof. they chewed the rubber off the legs, got the stainless bowls out and flung them around. i should have thought this thru better.not recommended for puppies.... other dogs probably just fine..."
3,Disappointed,"I was absolutely shocked when I received this item. I had read a review before my purchase which stated how small this dish was but I had no idea! It really is way too small. I am using it for my dog but it really is cat sized. If you have a medium or large dog, this is not for you."
3,Agree with the other reviewers,"Needed a good food bowl set for my 20-lb terrier who likes to spill water all over the place. This pet feeder did the job. Like the other reviewers said, the really weird grey panels that were pseudo-attached to the plastic holder totally caused a WTF moment, but after I removed and threw them away, the feeder looks better and is fine. Money well spent. Maybe the manufacturer will stop making those pieces and lower the price by a couple of bucks, which would make this a really good bargain."
3,Decent product,This product is good for the price. But if your dog is a messy drinker I don't think it will work well. Mine still get water all over the place!
4,Not Very Tall,"These are a great set of dog bowls. Stainless is very easy to keep clean. The height for the bowls is to keep your dog from stooping while eating or drinking which helps to avoid gas and upset stomach. These however are not very tall, depends on the size of your dog. Very good product though."
4,great buy for the pricing,"please note that the sides are not stainless steel, it is piece of wood cover with what looks like to be some type vinyl?? the bowls are...regardless it is Great buy for the price, it keeps my floor cleaned, great for small breed dogs"
4,"4"" elevated pet bowls","This 4"" elevated feeding bowl looks very nice in my kitchen. My Boston Terrier puppy can barely reach into it but she is growing so I think the size will be perfect for her in a few months.The unit seems sturdy and looks very nice. I will say though that on each side it has a wood panel that gives it a nice appeal and I do like the way it looks. However one of the panels, a longer one, does not stay up as it keeps sliding down to the bottom of the legs. I have tried sliding it back up but it will not hold on its own. I did jam some electrical tape to help hold that panel up and hopefully it will stay. I keep that side pointed to a wall now just in case.Compared to other elevated feeding bowls I have seen I still like this item over many that I have seen. Plus Amazon has a great price. Very sturdy, practical and looks very nice. Panel not fit right is the only reason I did not rate five stars."
5,"Our Pets 4-Inch Signature Series, Black/SS",Love this little bowl system - the bowls actually fit snugly and don't rattle around like the previous metal holder I purchased. I am so happy with the lack of noise and think my dog is as well. I have a small dog (about 12 pounds) and this size is perfect for him. It's SS so easy to clean and just all around good size to have in the kitchen without getting in the way. The only issue I have is the reversible sides don't stay up but that is a minor thing - I'll probably glue them in place. I have SS appliances with black quartz counters and it fits in well with my colors as a bonus. I would recommend to anyone with a small dog.
4,Attractive dog food bowl,"I bought this because my little dogs had pretty much destroyed their last food/water bowl, and the stainless-look design matches my kitchen.Pro: Good looking, especially with stainless steel appliances; good for small dogs; bowls are removableCon: Somewhat expensive; dogs ate the rubber things on the bottom of all 4 legs"
2,I hate the little wooden pannels.,"The bowls are the perfect size for my cat and I love the black. My problem is with the ""reversible stainless steel-looking panels"". First, they look nothing like stainless steel and are hideous. Second, they won't stay in place! The damn things keep sliding down, it's getting on my nerves. Why do they even bother having them on there? Why not just have the black plastic piece cover more instead of these stupid wooden things?"
5,Great feeder...,"After reseaching a number of raised feeders both in various stores and online, I purchased this particular one...I selected it because of both the material and the height. For the material, I'd read that some wood or laminate surface feeders tended to warp or become damaged over time from the water bowl. This one is all plastic so no risk of warping and it cleans very easily. For the height, I have an 85 lb. Old English Sheepdog so needed something to accommodate her size. This one is perfect. I use two ceramic bowls to make the whole thing heavier since she's such a big dog, and put a rug underneath it since she slobbers water quite a bit. She loves it, and her owner does too!"
5,"Great product, great price","Has worked out perfectly for us. Puppy loves it, no spills so far. A little bit 'light' on the stainless thickness, but hey, price is great. Stand nice."
3,Very good at staying in place and catching crumbs.,"I bought this hoping it would be perfect, but it's not. It's great at catching crumbs and water splashes from my dog. But the bowls are very deep and my dog has a short snout. He basically shoves his whole face in there and it comes out covered in food. I feed him wet food, so it's pretty yucky. He's a Bichon/ Shih tzu mix, so it's not a flat face, just kinda short. Hope I can find some other bowls that are the same diameter but more shallow."
4,Works well,The feedings cups go nowhere unless removed by human hands and the tray catches any food droppings that are not explicitly removed by my kitten to eat on the floor. The little bars for the feet help keep toys out from under the tray which is a nice bonus.
4,Banger !,"Back to Paris, back to good ol' Funk !I heard about this album on Generation FM (88.2, check it out).""Ladies Choice"" is a banger."
4,Too good for the money!,"This is what it is, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It's not a professional lens, but it works perfect for everyday amateur use. Nice focal range 28-80 (equivalent 42-120). Reasonable for anything indoors or fairly close, works as a portrait lens and does well with landscapes and architecture. Great general usage lens and compact as well. The price is really remarkable. I have 8 lenses and this one gets the most use. I have it mounted to a Pentax K20D"
4,Inexpensive and lightweight lens.,This is a good all purpose lens for general use. I'd recommend for someone who just need a basic lens and doesn't have much money to spend.
5,soulful,"I got involved with this EP because this young man has an excellent voice, he reminds me of a lot of the blue-eyed soul singers. ""Walk thru the River"" is a great song and should be played on the radio."
5,Echo Bodine,This is a must have for any massage therapist in training or seasoned massage therapist! Practical and heart felt advice for body workers!
5,Hands That Heal,"This book takes you through a journey of how Echo learned and developed her skills/gifts. Echo's books are easy to read and enjoyable.I have read almost every book this author has written, and I love her books."
1,Pure Rubbish!!,"I have been buying the Penguin Atlas books for almost two decades and I love them. This is an astounding dissapointment. It has the same colorful and pleasing format as the others. However, the statistics in this atlas are terrible. If you read the small print you find out that many of the maps are based on ""internet surveys"". For statistical purposes this is one step above pure fabrication. Furthermore, the bias in this book is so thick that I would call it propaganda. The slant in favor of homosexuality and against assigned gener roles in traditional societies is overwhelming. It so happens that I am on the same side, but in a statistical atlas I would prefer, at least, the pretense of impartiality."
1,garbage in it's purest form,"This crashed my Vista system within one hour. Crappy features, confusing design.....get Xppress Burn or Toaster."
2,Ripped me...,I don't know if this ite is good. it did not work for me. I tried to get some advice from my friend still not work for me.
5,Most Pleasing Handel,"I've not seen the two competitive DVD's of this opera currently listed by Amazon so make no comparative judgments.This is a fine production in every respect: song, scenery, acting, costumes. Not being purist in that regard, even were I to have found the director straying from the original, it would not bother me so long as the result is entertaining. This was quite entertaining with the humor delivered without blatant clowning and the arias sung engagingly and to good effect. Certainly one is able to grasp each of the central characters and take pleasure in their devious maneuvering to obtain their objectives. If you are the average viewer, I am confident that you will be gratified by this offering.And, oh that Handel music!"
3,Tidy summary of key conflicts in the English midlands,"With neither the glamour of the Scottish highlands nor the concentrated financial clout and international ties of London, the English midlands rarely receive much attention in major works. However, this pocket-sized edition briefs the reader on major battles in England's center, from Edward Longshank's sweep northward toward Stirling in the 13th century through the 17th century Civil War, in a terse, crisp style. Neither a survey nor a detailed examination, this volume presents tactical field problems and the men who strove to solve them. If you're a military history buff preparing to tour England, and some light reading seems good, take this book with you if you can find it: it will make everything from Culloden Moor to Bosworth Field come alive for you--and it's light enough to pack in a picnic basket."
1,Not a single fact,"the terrorist organization of MKO pays people to write false stories about them.... this book is one of them. Not a single fact, full of lies!"
1,"Very poorly written. Not factual,","Besides a very poorly written book that states absolute nonsense as fact, this book basically justifies a terrorist organization condemned by the U.S. State Department."
4,Excellent,I have owned this Stud Finder for about a year now. It never misses! Excellent for homeowners looking for studs!
2,Don't waste your money.,I purchased one and it did not do any better than the old magnet style. The electrical sensor always went off in the high setting. I wanted to use it on heavier wall texture. It might work better on smooth walls.I found the studs better the old fashion way. Hitting the wall with my hand until it was solid.
5,Works Great,Finds the edges of a studs within 1/8 inch. Also detects up live wires within approx 2-3 inches.
2,Older Home? Read the fine print!,"I was very disappointed to learn that the ""Triscanner cannot scan through . . . , in most cases, lath and plaster."" (This, by the way, was in the instructions fine print under ""Textured Ceilings""!)All 4 homes I have owned have lath and plaster walls. I think the manufacturer should have been a lot more up front with this information. To find out this important limitation you have to buy it and then read the small print at the end of the instructions.You'd think something that could scan through concrete could handle lath and plaster."
1,Don't throw your money away on this tool!,"I was very disappointed with this product. I thought that if I spent the money on a quality tool that I wouldn't have to worry about buying another one to do the job. I tried using this ""contractor grade"" studfinder on two different applications; a wall with drywall and a tiled wall. The readings for both jobs were very inconsistent. Needless to say, that tiled wall ended up with a lot more holes than necessary. You would think that a tool that could go through concrete, drywall and plywood would work through tile. This tool sits in my toolbox unused now. This is no better than using the old-style magnet, the only difference is that this item is much more expensive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"WE BOUGHT THIS ""SET OF FOUR"" AND ONLY RECEIVED THE MIDDLE TWO PEDAL COVERS! WHAT A RIP OFF! THE SELLER TRIED TO BLAME AMAZON FOR IT. WE HAVE A 2001 MUSTANG, AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN FIT, WE HAD TO CUT THEM TO FIT. PIECE OF CRAP!!!"
5,"Great carry CCW vest, also carries a lot of toys.","This is a well made vest, very useful for a lot of different activities such as CCW, fishing, sight seeing, carrying all you ipods, iphiones, etc."
2,Too Heavy!,"I got this vest and tried several times to use it for shooting, hunting, etc. But I kept coming back to one point... the vest is WAY too heavy... literally the thing weighs over 3 lbs (for the XXL). Yes, it has a concealed carry pocket, but who needs it? You can take the vest off and beat your assailant with it like a flail.I will say it is well made, but I sold mine and might consider getting the 5.11 taclite version of this vest made of lighter weight ripstop nylon. Or maybe a fishing vest instead, as I never used the concealed carry pockets anyways (4 o'clock IWB is more convenient and accessible everywhere but in the car)."
4,Vest,though it is quite heavy this vest is beautiful and confortable.It has too many pockets and it is handy for one that use manydevices in field works.
3,More Death Metal out of Quebec,A Solid Outfit out of Montreal. The Katakylsm boys produced this 1 i believe. A Solid effort and agreat live band. The Northern Hyberblast reigns supreme
2,Unusual,"I agree with the other reviewer. I collect card sets for the art work and this one is unique, if not weird and bizarre. It's near impossible to figure out what is going on within each image. Worth having as an art deck, but in my opinion pretty much impossible to read."
5,track listings!!!,1. knba anchorage airchecks 2. shawn mullins - everywhere i go 3. linda ronstadt - river 5. royal fingerbowl - somebody's coming 6. doves - catch the sun 7. tom sheehan - black ice 8. heather sullivan - don't compromise 9. phoenix - if i ever feel better 10. seven nations - bog dog 11. tom sheehan - coup d'etat 12. reeves gabrels - arrow 13. taylor and martinez - the unclean
4,Great value for the $,"My baby isn't due until 8/24/04, so I don't know how s/he will like the bassinet, but I love it! It only took my husband a little over an hour to put together, and the finished product is so nice! It seems pretty sturdy as well. The only thing that is slightly misleading is the color--on the website it appears beige & cream, it is really brown & cream! But thank goodness it still matched my decor; and is suitable for both a boy or girl."
4,Delighted for the price!,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars it because I haven't used this bassinet yet - but I am delighted with it for the price. It is taller than others, its options are very nice, and seems very sturdy.. a concern for us having a curious 3 yr old boy. The pattern is hard to discern online, but the fabric is identical to the beige plaid sheets that Target sells to go w/the Waverly Vintage Rose bedding collection, which we happen to have, so I was very happy about that. I have already purchased extra sheets by calling the customer service number on the instructions, they are $5-$6 each plus shipping. Anyone with concerns about space might want to look at an identical Graco model at a baby store, this bassinet is larger than 'conventional' bassinets and is wide at the legs, but they are very nice because they have wheels that can lock and completely fold up when you want the bassinet to rock. I would recommend this unit, especially for the competitive price."
1,very disapointed,"We recently purchased this item and are very unhappy. The fabric was smelly and we washed it which made the fabric rough. The sheet then did not fit onto the pad and now we do not have a sheet to use. After we assembled the unit, it seems too wobbly for us to use and we are going to return the item. This was too much money for the item that we were shipped. I hope that helps so other people are not disapointed like we are."
5,baby bassinet,This product works great. It was so nice to have my baby right next to me. I slept beter just knowing I could hear my newborn. What a wonderful Idea!
3,Where do you find sheets to fit the mattress?,"I love how this combo looks, love the features, love that it raises so high to fit our bed, but I cannot find sheets that fit the mattress. I am frustrasted beyond belief that I only have a cover for the mattress and not a real sheet. If anyone can possibly help, I would be grateful. At this point I have bought flannel recieving blankets and will be making sheets, but obviously, would like to have the convienence of purchasing pre- made sheets for proper fit. Thoughts, comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated....."
3,Broken snaps,"I like this item, but was unset when I had it all together only to find out that one of the snaps that hold the storage basket was missing. When you reach that point practically the whole thing is already together. Very disappointed but will keep it to avoid extra charges."
5,Wonderful Product,"I purchased this item for my sister-in-law who just had a baby. It is great!!! The bassinet is top quality and I would recommend it to anyone. I recently found out that my husband and I are lucky enough to be expecting, and this was the first thing I ran out and bought! Good price and good quality!"
3,Schoolhouse Rock! Grammar Rock,"Here's a quick fix or review for those children struggling with understanding grammar. Because of the easy tunes and rhyming lyrics, children will quickly remember the correct ways to use nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, subjects, and predicates. Because of the age of the product, it has inherent problems. Grammar usage rules have changed over the years, so children may pick up some weak or incorrect ideas on usage. Although many of us remember ""Conjunction Junction"" with great delight, children need to recognize the new list of conjunctions. The video tends to stress passive writing over active writing. Bits of the language in the ""Adjective"" song allow kids to belittle or mock others. But the joy of learning through music--even with dated lyrics--allows for a meeting ground where parents can add to the learning process."
5,The ONLY pick to use for any style music.,"If a pick can make you a better guitarist, then this is the one to use."
3,Too small,They are half the size of a regular pick. Bit too thick for me. Sound nice. Will last forever. Wish I had sized them before I bought them.
5,Best picks on eart,"Once you use this thing, everything else becomes too bulky, too big.Best pick ever. Wish they sold the kirk hammet version of this."
5,My teacher was right,"I started playing only about 10 months ago or so, but I can tell I'll be using these for a while. On my first class my teacher gave me a Jazz III pick to keep, telling me they're his favorite and that he highly reccommends it. He was abolutely right! I recieved a pack of Beatles picks which are a lot larger, and I've tried using them but they just aren't the same. I *love* these picks."
4,Neat little phone.,"This is a neat and unique design that is sure to turn heads. The buttons are smaller and more inline with small fingers, like those of you little sister or a women's hand. It comes with many features and it is a great alternative to the L7 SLVR which comes with iTunes.If you need to get an affordable GSM phone without a contract, this one is a keeper."
3,"If an Author Forgets a Word, It Shouldn't Be Part of the Title!","I agree that this book seems to be mistitled. If it had been more appropriately titled ""Basic Whitewater Kayaking"" I would have kept looking elsewhere, others interested in whitewater (river-running, playboats, etc.) might have been drawn more to it, and life would be better.While some basics are universal for the sport, this well-illustrated book is solely aimed at the whitewater enthusiast, and only accidentally takes along the quiet water paddler for the ride."
2,If it would fit my 1/2 inch Makita it would be great but...,Unfortunately this 1/2 inch Makita Chuck Key does not fit my 1/2 inch Makita drill. The pilot does not fit into the drill's hole making it totally worthless. Too bad.
1,Some clever ideas... if you have the integrity for it.,"This guy offers advice like going to the guy in the front of the line at a barber shop and giving him a sob story about how your mom just died. Another suggestion is to pick a wimp at the front of the line in a crowded amusement park and try to make him think that you're a man of God who has to get the orphans back in an hour. Would he please just let you in in front of him. Then if he doesn't oblidge, there's a reason you picked a wimp. You now threaten him with physical violence.If those methods suit you, you'll probably like the book."
1,waste of money,"this book has no value at all. its suggestions for getting ahead of other people in emnergency rooms: ""say you have a pain in your chest"". i wasted $6.00."
3,Picture different from actual product,"If you need Polaroid film, this is a good buy but beware, you don't get the platinum film, just regular 600. The photo is misleading."
5,This film is hard to find!!,"I used it to take pictures of my guests at my wedding, instead of them signing a cheesy guest book that I will never read. I put the pictures together in a groovy collage. Get the film while you can! It is rare!"
3,Polaroid 600 film,"This was the product: 6 ""600 Instant Color Film (3-1/4 x 3-3/4), 10 Exposures/Cartridge, 4 Cart./Pac""$50.55Sold by: Endless VarietyAll the film worked fine except for 1 of the 24 10-packs, which seemed to have a manufacturing defect. Polaroid film is getting harder to locate and more expensive each year."
5,good,my mother loves her camera. so finding the film was good for my budget. it was exactly what i wanted. thanks!
1,"Lose the orchestra. More, more, more of the rest.",The traditional tracks on this album are simply amazing. Energetic and hard-driving as any R&R song. Why the overproduced and synthesized tracks? It serves only to turn it into new-age atmospheric crap. I detested the orchestrated tracks as much as I loved the traditional ones.
5,"""Golden Books"" continue to enlighten, thrill & educate.","""Golden Books"" were great for my children and grandchildren, and now their ""Fishing"", ""A Guide To Fresh and Salt-water"", book helps me with salt-water fish identification and tackle preparation. I have recently relocated to the S.C. coast and do a lot of salt-water fishing. With all of the rules and regulations relative to fish size and limits, ""Fishing"" comes in handy in identifying the fish caught so as not to run afoul of the ""man"" by having the wrong fish in the creel."
4,compact book,"It was a much smaller book than I expected, but that was actually a plus. It fits easily into a pocket when out fishing. Good reference."
5,Great tool for the beginning and experienced fisherman!,"I saw an earlier edition of the ""Golden Guide to Fishing"" many years ago when I was young and it left an impression on me then. I always believed it would make a nice addition for teaching the Fishing Merit Badge in Boy Scouts. After purchasing and reading the new edition, I am convinced. A great resource for not only the beginning fisherman, but also for experienced anglers as well."
2,dissapointed,"I read reviews saying how informative and complete this book was, especially on chameleons of east africa. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of species covered and how little information it gives on even the little it did cover. It didnt even know if some of the species laid eggs or if the males used the horns for battle! lol. I also have the chameleons of africa book by tilbury and that book is absolutely amazing. I was surprised to see just how many species of chameleons from east africa were not even in this book. It does have a cool cover tho!:)"
5,props from around the way.,"Much props, Thanks for the exciteing tunes through the yrs. us just trying to cope, hold on. keep putting forth effort, keep praise."
1,Poor quality,"The first time I used this tape on a job, it sliced my index finger open as the blade returned to the case. My girl friendused it and the same thing happened to her. I took a close look at the blade and found out that the edges are poorlyfinished and it's on the thin side. Sort of like those no name tapes that cost about a third as much. Save your money!"
5,Beautiful!,"This item was exactly as I expected! Arthur Court never disappoints. It is on the smaller side, but very pretty."
1,Hockey Stories for Short Attention Spans,"'Hockey Stories for Short Attention Spans' is a better title for this book. The stories are only short anecdotes and many of them aren't even a page long. A reader could finish the entire book in under three hours. It's not very satisfying, either. It doesn't reveal much that fans haven't already heard about, nor does it discuss anything in depth. It offers little more than a small collection of cute factoids and famous quotes. There are also some mistakes. One of the most glaring is the description of the front cover photograph containing Leafs' Ponikarovsky and Senators' Magnus Arvedson. The description says the picture is of Mario Lemieux and Nevin Reid. I'd recommend this book to any fourth grade hockey lover with a book report due the next day. For rest of us, this bone offers hardly any marrow."
4,A nice collection of vignettes about hockey,"Folks who know me or follow my posts realize that I read a lot of books about hockey. A LOT.Dan Diamond's ""Hockey Stories On and Off the Ice"" is a nice read. The stories aren't very deep or very long, BUT they're a nice selection of tidbits across more than 100 years of hockey. (Most are about professional hockey, but not all.) I'd heard most of these before - I've been collecting and reading about the topic for around 40 years! - BUT the telling was still pleasant and a nice reminder, and there were STILL a few that I'd never heard before.Give it a read. You can pick it up, put it down for awhile, then pick up right where you left off, and while that might not be an endorsement of ""literature"", it means that a book like this achieved its aim."
4,This excellent release has a caveat,"I will not engage in reviewing the excellent music, performance and recording, since it has been done very well already. But the people at BRIDGE deserve an admonishment for their production values.This refers to the 22+ minutes of the 1956 Emperor Jones ballet here included, music that has not been otherwise recorded (at least not so well!)First, there are two vocalises (male & female) not credited anywhere. But worse: this ""suite"" has clearly defined sections/movements, which could have been further described and indexed. For that, one star goes off."
1,Don't waste the hours it will take to get through each page,"I know little about Virginia Woolf and less about Michael Cunningham however, I do not feel that I needed to know about either to state that this was the most boring book I have ever read. I felt that the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting. The plot lacks the 'spice' that makes you want to rush home to read more. It was interesting to see how the characters lives were going to come toghether but the book was so slow moving I ended up not caring as much. The only thing positive that I can say was that Cunningham writes well, I just wish he had written something else."
3,women are complex,"I like the author's style of writing, but the theme is redundent and although I like to see more written about the crossing of paths by women, I found this rather depressing. Read Nuns and Priests, the Great Divide by O'Mara for more about women crossing paths."
2,A sheer waste of time,"I got this book just for the hype. Remind me not to do that again.What were these characters? You don't even feel them and the book ends. Wow!! You need to be a real genius to fit the lives (and supposedly sorrows) of three women in a mere 240 pages. Unfortunately Michael Cunningham is not that genius.Very disappointing. I like to feel the characters in a book, this one failed in that completely."
4,hey Singapore,"The reader from Singapore who wrote the first review on The Hours has done the rest of us a great disservice by revealing the ending. Glad you liked the book, but did you have to go and blow the surprise like that?"
2,"Read better, Read worse","This book was ok, if you like this sort of thing. But why read ABOUT Virginia Woolf when you can READ Virginia Woolf? Michael Cunningham is like the Puff Daddy of the literary world, simply by borrowing an idea from a literary genius and twisting it into his own tale. Skip it. Read Mrs. Dalloway."
3,"Nice book, nothing else","I liked and I disliked this book for the same reasons: I found this book well written, intellectual, a little too snobbish, a little too ""built up"" to make a perfect construction. In this book the characters and the situations that would have had the potentialities to be described in vivid colors (a strong red, a shining yellow, a bright green) are described in pale pink, nice fuchsia or cute violet. The final impression is of a nice book , nothing else."
4,"Fresh, Open Writing","I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. Cunningham's writing style is very easy on the eyes, and brain. The imagery of Manhattan really hit home. I've only been there 3 times, but every time he went to paint that picture, I felt like he was describing home. The other 2 or 3 scenarios were similarly enjoyable. All the characters were created and shaped with just as much attention to making this book a personal experience for the reader. HOWEVER, the cheesey plot culmination at the end, I could have done without. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but I spotted the end at about halfway through the book."
5,Exhilarating,"This is truly a fine work by this author. &#65533;There's just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seem, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we've ever imagined.... Still, we cherish the city, the morning; we hope, more than anything, for more.&#65533; We can&#65533;t ask for any more from this author. This book was written exceptionally well for its time and relevance to our society. There are none like it in the world. Dreams gateway to the self is also another book that has given me a newfound respect for life. Check them both out at Amazon.com."
3,He's a wonderful writer but this is not worth a Pulitzer.,"Cunningham is a writer who loves words and his craft. His ""A Home at the End of the World"" was almost perfect (the ending is very weak). This is too crafty, too self-conscious and writerly. He simply tries too hard here and these characters are not worth caring about. He'll reach his potential eventually, but only when he goes back to being less concerned with art and returns to caring about his characters. Maybe now that he's won the prize...?"
3,Strengths and weaknesses both,"Is this the first 3-star review? All the others represent extremes of repulsion or devotion--perhaps a good sign for a book. After all, it draws a reaction. To measure Cunningham's prose against Woolf is perhaps unfair--but, he sets up the comparison himself. He's a good writer, perhaps a bit precious and too self-conscious about writing a good line--and all in all he did a pretty great job of pulling together three separate narratives about characters that range from boring to merely dull to fascinating (Woolf). The story line about the California wife I found excruciating until she decides to check into a hotel. At that point I thought ""great. She's going to kill herself and we can get on with the good stuff.""A lurid question: Did Woolf really only use one stone to drown herself? I thought there were several...."
3,Not that impressive,"I read this book because it said it was a Pulitzer prize winner, so I went in with high expectations. There is much comparison to Virginia Woolf's work, which I have read none of. However, I found this book within a book and overlapping characters nothing special. It's been done. The over analysis of the dissassociation of the characters to their world was interesting, however, also not especially brilliant. I expected more. It was mildly entertaining at best."
1,morbid introspection of the middle class,"Michael Cunningham details his characters' neuroses with faultless observation, this much is true. That they should have been created when their pitiful self-loathing is detailed at such tedious length and with such loving skill is altogether another matter. Many people have praised this book judging by the reviews but I found it's characters' total lack of redeeming qualities nauseating and predictable over and again. The lack of plot was forgiveable as I had read one of his previous books. I imagine I would have avoided this book like the plague had the cover hinted, not so much at it's prizewinning genius, but more accurately at it's narcissistic 'hipper than thou' self hating monotony. Next."
1,For suicidal gender searchers,"Depressing tale(s) of unhappy homosexuals pondering their fates. The author clearly thinks many/most are barely clinging on to their sanity, going through life faking it, and living day to day looking for a way out. No joy of living here. Life is a *****. A Pulitzer? Jeez! Prozac for one and all. Get a life. ENJOY life rather than read about mopers who spend time inching flower pots around on coffee tables to get just the right effect or contemplate what might have been rather than taking what life has dealt you and giving it your best shot. We've all got problems. Why waste 226 pages on hand wringers who can't deal with theirs?"
2,lacking,"The idea was a good one, and it was extremely brave and ambitious of M Cunningham to try to weave the 3 lives together. But ultimately he failed, in my opinion. Just as I began settling down with one character and thinking of her perspective, there would be an immediate and abrupt jump back to another character. As a result, I felt a lack of connection and also a lack of sympathy, for any of the 3 women. Each was interesting in her own way, but there just wasn't the time to mentally bond with any single one of them. While it was an interesting literary technique, I found myself losing interest in the book half way through and had to force myself to finish it, which is unusual for me. All the hype didn't help as it heightens ones expectations."
5,A wonderful read,I really loved this book..I had just finished reading two very disappointing books and to read such a treasure was wonderful...I went out and bought Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolfe as well as Mr. Cunningham's two other Novels and am looking forward to reading them all...I plan on reading The Hours again.
3,Got this DVD for school...,"I got this DVD for a class I was taking and had to compare this with another story. The movie was alright, nothing I would go to the movies and go see. Just not my cup of tea but English enthusiasts will enjoy it."
4,"Beautifully written, but something lacking for me","Michael Cunningham should be a Pullitzer Prize winner for the stunning words in this novel. Scenery, dialogue and inner thoughts are so aptly described. I was drawn to the prose.My friends all loved the book. They recommended it so many times, I purchased a copy and dug in. I'm sorry to say I had to force myself through the stories, though. Each woman in the book was an interesting person unto herself, but goodness, I just couldn't love them. Tying them together at the end seemed trite. I would have been satisfied with the three different stories that only linked with the Virginia Woolf book.I wanted to love it. I loved the prose, but just didn't love the story. I'm still giving it four stars for the writing, but the missing star is reserved for my personal satisfaction with the story. Sorry."
4,lovely and lyrical but nervy in its imitation,"I found ""The Hours"" to be a lovely, lyrical piece of writing, but I found myself wondering from time to time if it isn't presumptuous to insert oneself into the minds of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, to assume that one is in a position to write from their points of view. I found Leonard's character to be slighted here, one-dimensional and without real feeling, which I also found to be true for Vanessa Bell. Cunningham's period dialogue doesn't ring true for me; I much prefer his prose. Film producer Scott Rudin has optioned this book for a film adaptation -- I'm curious what other readers think of this, and if any of you can think of a way to adapt this successfully for film."
4,"Echoes of Mrs. Dalloway, but more and less.","I read ""The Hours"" and ""Mrs. Dalloway"" back to back and found ""Dalloway"" breathtaking and ""Hours"" a great read in its own right. I think it's really unfair to try to compare them, though Cunningham certainly invites the comparison. I found the principal characters of ""Hours"" quite interesting, the story line(s) fascinating, and the prose very expressive. Although I really love this book, I found one bit of geographic sloppiness very distracting: an early scene (p.50) describes an event occuring in lower Manhattan at the corner of Spring and MacDougal Streets. No such corner exists. I suspect the author had in mind either Prince and MacDougal or Spring and Sullivan."
3,Beautiful prose but stifling and morose,"I found myself a little disappointed with this widely acclaimed piece of literature. There is no doubt in my mind that the writing style and meticulous detailed writing of Mr. Cunningham is exquisite, but as far as the plot was concerned, I was left wanting much more than what was given. Having read virtually everything by Virginia Woolf, I was impressed by his portrayal of her character, but the intertwining of the others that was so strongly applauded by critics did not entirely put me in a state of awe. The novel, as many of the reviewers pointed out, presented the flaws of humankind, but it did not make me care one ounce about the outcome of any of the people involved. I was left with a lackluster feeling of something that was unfinished, when I had anticipated some sort of epiphany, judging by the acclaim the book has received."
2,A disappointment,"I would agree with the reviewer who found the writing style contrived. Worse than that, I found the book to be misogynistic. I realize it is supposed to be a feminist book, of sorts, but it was far from that. Despite a common thread of bizarre and annoying self-importance, all of the female characters in the book were sexually ambiguous, all were hopelessly tied to a lover of some sort, and seemed to feel little if any control over their own lives.I understand this is a book about three women of separate times, ""connected"" by their similarities, but the (perhaps unintended) effect was to show women in general as unhappy, hand-wringing, self-involved, and unstable creatures. Virginia Woolf must be turning over in her grave."
5,Extraordinary and Profound,"I had several reasons to read this book. First, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" is one of my favorite books and the film adaptation of ""The Hours"" is one of my favorite movies. So, I was prepared for something profound, but I was not expecting a book that would speak to me the way this one did. Michael Cunningham has a way of describing his characters' thoughts and feelings that makes me feel like he's inside my own mind. The fears, sensations, and oddities of Virginia, Laura, and Clarissa are so much like my own and it forced private feelings that I have never really acknowledged to come to the surface. Reading this book was a a very personal experience for me, but I believe that any reader will be able to enjoy it. Cunningham explores an incredible variety of emotions and demonstrates a unique understanding of human nature. I would recommend this book to pretty much everyone I know."
4,Intersection of the Lives of 3 Women,"This is a masterful book and was worthy of the Pulitzer prize of which it was a winner.The book's plot deals with the intersection of the lives of 3 women, each living in a different time - Virginia Wolff, Clarissa Dalloway, and Ms. Brown (mother of Clarissa's friend).Connected through stream of consciousness, entwined by the thoughts andworks of Virginia Wolff, this novel is a deep and profound exploration of depression, loss and despair.I usually don't like movie versions of books but this movie did the book justice. I highly recommend both the book and the movie."
4,"Good, but not great","I really enjoyed reading this book for my intro college english course. It was a fairly easy read and the mutiple stroy lines were very intresiting. Howevere I WOULD NOT read this book without reading Mrs. Dalloway first. I am giving Cunningham only 4 stars, because I liked Mrs. Dalloway better. Still it was a book worth reading."
2,Does very little for me,"I never felt like I got anywhere with this book. Yes, I saw how the women's lives merged, but that does not a story make. I think that is my problem. I expect a story. Books like this one and Catcher in the Rye are not focused on the story as much as the feelings and emotions of the characters. They try to give the reader a sense of what it is like to be depressed or to hold back rage and strong emotional feelings. I respect that but have not gained from it. I don't read books to be pulled down by depression and angry emotions. I read to be entertained, and that requires a story."
3,The Painful Hours,"I found this novel terribly disappointing. I had just read A Home At The End Of The World and was desperately in need of more fantastic literature. I assumed that this novel would be just as great, if not even better. Well, I made an ass out of you and me. I found it boring and rather difficult to get through. It was a quick, easy read, but I was bored to tears through most of it. I think I only got through it because I was eager to finish it and move on to a better book. The only reason it gets any stars at all is because once again, I am sucked in by Cunningham's writing. I wouldn't say DON'T read it, because I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who adore this novel and I'm sure they are right, in their own way. Personally, however, I didn't enjoy it near as much as I'd hoped."
2,What was the point of that?,"Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities. The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny. It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood. It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare."
2,Left me cold,"The book is beautifully written. Cunningham is clearly an outstanding writer. But the subject matter of the book is cold and as I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself - ""who cares?"" I never developed even the slightest empathy for the characters, whose lives I found totally uninspired."
4,"First read ""Mrs. Dalloway"" then read ""The Hours""","""The Hours"" is a glittering, multi-layered homage to Virginia Woolf and ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Cunningham's three stories reverberate off each other and off ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in a dazzling commentary on life, love and death. In a single day each of three women, readying herself for a party grand or ordinary, grapples with many of life's more profound issues. Kisses are exchanged, spurned lovers regretted. Some are caregivers, others their prisoners. Anyone who has recently read ""Mrs. Dalloway"" will recognize the brilliance with which Cunningham manipulates its themes and plot while incorporating very modern feminist and gay issues."
2,Don't see the movie first,"I saw the movie first and wanted to read the book to see if there was any explanations for a bunch of stuff I found confusing. The book was almost exactly like the movie for the first 50 pages, so I got bored and stopped reading it. It now rests in the bookcase between an Authentic Italian Cookbook whose recipes were way too complicated, and my Young Lady Chatterley DVD. If you're really into literature, I suppose you'll love it, if you're a casual reader, you'll probably grow bored."
2,Couldn't get through it,"I really don't know what all the hype was surrounding this book, I guess it's a matter of preference, but I found it so excruciatingly dull, I eventually had to give up on it (something that I never do - I love reading!). Maybe it needs a different environment to read (like lying on a beach, rather than on the #5 subway downtown!), so I'll keep it and hope to return to it someday, but for now, it just didn't grab me...."
2,Mediocre at best,"I was disappointed in the book, I didn't feel there was enough story in this book. I think there were too many characters in the book to gain a true understanding of the characters. The book felt like it was written for the movies."
1,Author's self-love kills book,"This is a sophomoric literary exercise posing as a novel, a gimmick passing as art. Poor Cunningham appears to have lost touch with reality, in favor of preciousness and elitist posturing. What happened to the man who had his empathetic pulse on our times, and our lives? A real disappointment."
1,Wondering why it gets rave reviews?,"I just read ""The Hours"" right after reading two otherbest-sellers. Frankly, I don't understand why this book received thePulitzer Prize! Perhaps it's due to the socially timely topic. The overabundance of details in the book did NOT make it come alive for me - in fact I started skipping these paragraphs. The unnecessary details remind me of an over-decorated Christmas tree, with every possible color, shape, and size of decoration thrown on. I also found the main characters boring. The only (intellectually) pleasing aspect of the book was the last chapter - it gave the book a surprising twist."
4,A gifted writer,"It saddens me to see that people have described this book as being about ""lesbians and suicide,"" since the scope of this book is so much more. Cunninham has managed to take three distinctly different women and blend them together seemlessly. This is not a plot driven book so if you're looking for something that grabs you and keeps you turning pages so you find out what happens next, pass on this. If you're looking for a beautifully crafted story that deal more with deep emotion, love, loss and alienation then this book will speak volumes to you. I found this book haunting, sad and beautiful at the same time. Cunningham's gift with words and phrasing is brilliant. The book hasn't been critically praised because it's ground-breaking, it is because of it's depth and it's flow. Read this, you wont' be disappointed."
4,deft use of multiple generations in plot,"a touching, moving tribute to the mind of Virginia Woolf, which actually elevates her story to something that probably would have made her proud. While the ""Educate everyone about AIDS"" theme sometimes feels like it's being force fed to us (and if I see one more novel-turned-into-movie book with the cheesy actor shot on the cover, I may scream), this is an inventive, highly creative story worthy of the praise it is getting.The characters are rich in development and a true insight is gained into the inner workings of their diverse hopes, dreams and failures.What a mind to come up with such a crafty, ingenious plotline!"
3,Really good but a little too heavy on description,"This is one of those cases where, had I read the book first, I probably would have been in awe of the richness and touching insights in this story. I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I had to read the book that started it all and I was probably wanting the story to move at a different, more visual pace.The story is amazing and this writer definately has an incredibly original mind. My only complaint is that it dwells a lot on lingering descriptions while I am just dying for the story to move on. Once it does, it's heavenly. The flow of the story is just sometimes stalled with details.For instance, in one scene, an assistant brings in a cup of coffee and we have to hear about her story and what she appears to be but what she really is and I just want to hear the conversation of the main characters that is going to take place.Still, of course, it is a wonderful book and will leave you touched."
2,Hours of Preciosity,"At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I have to admit I was rather disappointed with this book and all the hoopla surrounding it. Cunningham fashions some pretty sentences, but his writing has neither the intellectual rigor nor the incandescent beauty of Woolf at her best. At its essence, this book is just another foray into the lives of sensitive bohemian types with the specter of AIDS looming ominously as a surefire means of eliciting sympathy and respect. Cunningham should concentrate on developing his own voice as a writer and not paying homage to writers who clearly outrank him."
2,"Just too sad, and, sadly, real","OK, I admit it, I've never read Mrs. Dalloway, and don't recall that I've ever read any V.Woolf. I'm sure there are many people who go through many days the way these three sad, beautiful women do, and I guess it's a testament to Mr. Cunningham's writing that he could show me this desolation, but it was hard work to keep picking up this book and live through this day with them. At times I thought the writing was just too self-conscious, too ornate; it distracted me from the story. Perhaps I'm just one of those meat-n-potatoes readers who likes story over style.I did like the ending; gullible me, I was surprised. I gave it two stars instead of three to avoid being wishy-washy, and I give myself five for making it through to the end of the book! I would not recommend it to the depressed, or to anyone suffering from post-partum blues!"
2,Authors should NOT narrate their audio books,"I want to listen to this book, truly I do. And I know that I'll like it because it's right up my alley. But I could not get through the first disk. Why do some authors insist on reading their own books? Is it to save a buck? Is it because they think they can do it better justice than an actor? Well, they're wrong in most cases. I couldn't get past the dramatic (or otherwise) pauses this author used, sometimes between every word in a single sentence. Usually, I hang in there and even an annoying voice starts to grow on me or becomes tolerable. This was painful though. So I guess I'll have to do it the good old fashioned way, and download it to my Kindle. :-)"
4,enjoyable quick read,"While this book didn't grab me at first, I soon came to love reading it. This book dealt with three characters--Virginia Woolf (who was in the process of writing ""Mrs. Dalloway""), Clarissa (who is living in the present time and who is called Mrs. Dalloway by her best friend), and Mrs. Brown (who lives in the 1940s and is reading ""Mrs. Dalloway""). Each chapter is given the heading of the character writing it. I loved how everything in the story from the text, to the characters, to the thoughts were intertwined and how everything was linked by Virginia Woolf's book."
2,Well-Written but Boring,"If you want to read this book because it won the Pulitzer, don't be so stupid. Granted, this is a very well-written book, replete with great metaphors and a very successful omniscient narrative. But it's so boring, even though it's about lesbians. Wait until this book is made into a movie, or becomes a prerequisite for a college class."
2,The Hours: Most Overrated Novel of the 90s?,"In a word: vacuous.Content: Does Cunningham add anything to the plot of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" except for reflexive criticisms of traditional lifestyles? This novel is like a bad cover version. And, to paraphrase Elmore Leonard, Cunningham seems to specialize in writing the type of passages which people ""skip over.""Style: Cunningham is a blandly elegant writer. He makes the serious mistake of quoting passages from ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Now, I am not convinced Woolf's writing is always completely successful, but she is undoubtedly highly original and thoughtful in her prose style and is brimming with things to say. The contrast was seriously damaging to Cunningham.That this novel won the Pulitzer Prize shows that the prize has become an entirely pr-driven affair. I actually picked up the book because I wanted to read it prior to seeing the movie with Meryl Streep. Now, I'm not planning on seeing the movie anymore."
1,Highlights are too modern,"The modernization of Woolf's life in this book is a little too unrealistic and fabricated. The novel is filled with too much modern day nonsense to be taken seriously. The dark, moody, sombre tone of the book is depressing. One feels as though they have taken a ride on the 'dark side' with Cunningham as the author. Better to read a biography about Virginia Woolf!"
3,Take time to stop and read the sentences...,"This book was engrossing because of the author's use of language. He describes three situations simultaneously from three distinct time periods, and manages to eloquently capture the different emotions stirring in each character. Despite the author's use of language, I felt that three stars was appropriate for this book because of the overall lack of plot and character development."
2,Left disappointed,"I enjoyed the author's method of writing, and his vivid descriptions were wonderful. I was somewhat satisfied with the book until the last few chapters when things just got, well...stupid. I think each character was beautifully written, but the way they were brought together was uncreative. I was appalled with the simple ending to this book. I fumbled throught the entire book hoping for a decent amount of closure, but was left disappointed. In all I applaud the author for his characterization and style, but I would ask him to sit a little longer next time thinking of a more solid plot."
2,A Beautifully Overrated Gem,"Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to agree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and ultimately disappointing reference to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.) I am puzzled, still, at my disappointment; have I missed something, or am I merely more discerning, wary of the aura of prize-winning?"
5,"Not usually my cup of tea, but really good.","I generally like a little more story to my story, and struggle with books that are well written slice of life pieces. This book, however, did it so well that I didn't mind. I did as many of these reviews suggested and read Mrs. Dalloway first and must admit I liked this better. These are three interconnected stories that are woven together effortlessly and adeptly with a central motif of sex and suicide. Cunningham uses language much like Woolf but the stories move faster and more purposively."
5,The best book I've read all year,"I rented the film Mrs. Dalloway -with Vanessa Redgrave- before starting this book because it had been so many years since I've read the Virginia Woolf novel (the film is great, by the way.) This is a beautifully written book with three interesting story lines. It's hard to imagine a man writing so well about the inner lives of women, but the author surprised me again and again with his insightfulness. A sad book, in many ways, about lives not lived as they might have been, but a true book. I highly recommend it."
1,"One of the worst, couldn't finish",This book was chosen as a book club selection. I would consider myself a very open minded reader and choose books from all subjects. There are very few books that I have not been able to finish and this is one of them. I found myself having to re-read parts just to remember what character I was reading about at that point. I would not recommend this book to anyone and now I know why the library I picked it from had only one copy and it was on the shelf. This is one book I definately won't be paying a late fee on and will be back in plenty of time for another sucker to pick up off the shelf.
5,Amazing...A work of literature,Cunningham's The Hours is a true classic of modern American fiction. I cannot recommend it enough to those that are tired of run-of-the-mill American novels that are published annually.
4,tHE hOURS,"I've never read Virginia Wolfe so I went into this with no expectations. Here were my primary reactions: A bit too talky up to the third or fouth chapter. Amazing that a man did such a great job of speaking in a feminine voice. All characters were just a bit too outside the the norm, too extreme (except Clarissa) to really relate to them. The homosexuality theme was redundant and contrived and did nothing to drive plot. I especially liked the Laura Brown character whose visions were so intense it seemed her brain would burst.The book was a very worthwhile experience although I found myself in a state of depression while reading it. The author did a great job on a complicated structure. I would recommend it."
3,Surprisingly Average,"I had never read a Pulitzer winning book before I picked up The Hours, and - I tell ya - I've read better. Much better.The story was well written enough. I liked the links between the three women; Virginia Woolf writing her classic Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa (Mrs. Dalloway) getting ready for her party and Laura Brown - reading the novel in the fifties. I liked how Cunningham mirrored Virgina's thought processes in constructing Mrs. Dalloway, with what was happening in Clarissa's day.Technically - I can't find fault with the book. It is just that it lacks.. that certain something. The x-factor. The bit that kept me from holing myself up in my bedroom frantically turning pages, biting my nails to see what happened next. It just wasn't there. It lacked engagement.Maybe the movie is better, who knows?"
1,Precious Little,"This gimmicky paean to the gay and lesbian lifestyle ""drags"" on for hours. The only section that rose above the whiny, self-indulgent norm involved Virginia Woolf, her niece and nephews, and a dead thrush. The prose is finely chiseled (So precious! So cute!) but it says nothing and takes you nowhere.At one point, ""Mrs. D"" speculates as to the fate the future will assign the writings of another character. The only fate imaginable for this slight volume is total, permanent oblivion closing in quickly, as the glitterati move on to the next shiny, superficial work which reflects their infinite self-importance and self-pity. It's both laughable and a sad commentary on the state of American letters that this claptrap garnered the Pulitzer Prize. Perhaps next year the judges will free themselves from the service of the so-called cultural elite and reward a book with substance as well as ""style""."
1,Kryptonite,"Why do I hate this book so much? Well, let's see...it opens with a dramatic reconstruction of Virginia Woolf's suicide. That struck me as rather tasteless.If this was the only problem with the book I might have reserved judgment. However, Cunningham continues the ""good work"" begun in his earlier novels of portraying women as flobby wandering half-souls whose emotions occasionally crop up, as warts or an ingrown hairs might, to further confuse them in their blind stumblings through the world.Silly women, always getting in the way. I'm probably not going to get very many ""helpful"" votes for this review but I strongly, strongly suggest that you read MRS. DALLOWAY, the novel that Cunningham's work is ostensibly based on, and never even consider picking up THE HOURS."
2,Gravy Train,"Here's a ""novel"" approach to winning a pulitzer prize: simply copy an existing novel.I liked this better the first time when it was called ""Mrs. Dalloway""."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book because it received so much hype I felt I HAD to. Also, because it's based on Mrs. Dalloway, which I think is one of the finest novels ever written. Having read it, I can see why it's gotten the attention it has--it's just the sort of referential--and reverential--book that academics love. But it's boring and full of cliches about contemporary urban life as well as suburban life in the late 40s. It has none of the subtlety, brilliance, and depth of Woolf's own writing. Not one of its characters engages the reader's interest--instead, they're all dull shadows of Woolf's sharply drawn originals. You won't waste much time reading this book, as it's very slight both in length and content, but if you're looking for good writing and true insights in human character you'd be better off reading Mrs. Dalloway again,."
2,uninspired fiction,"Cunningham is a talented writer and this book is well written so I give it two stars for that. The problem is that the subject matter is painfully boring. I never developed any empathy for the characters, who I found extraordinarily uninteresting. While I was reading this book, I kept thinking why did Cunningham waste his time writing about this. His talents were utterly wasted here. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
4,"""A work of art""",The way this novel is set up and told is genius in itself. Describing and telling the story of three diferent women in different time periods all going through self issues. the way Michael Cunningham tells the story with using real life situations and the characters all being connected is brilliant. This keeps you involved and makes you keep reading to try to find out what the truth is behind each woman. Even though this book is a fiction novel it has semi-true things in it. Such as Virginia Woolf is shown in a day writing her famous novel Mrs. Dalloway. I would recommend both the book and the film to anyone. Every moment I spent reading it was no waste. This is a book that makes you question things and that to me is a good and interesting book to read.
3,Call me naive and provincial....,but I felt that I wasted my time reading this book. I disliked it and felt that the overall mood was depressing and fatalistic. I was not an English major and am sure that most of the references to Woolf were lost on me. By the same token I don't demand Sound of Music at the box office. Call me provincial but I don't like to be dragged through mud by a book and made to feel worse after reading it. If you really get off on melancholy you'll love this book.
4,Think of it as a piece of music....,"Fans of straightforward story-writing might be frustrated by Michael Cunningham's book, which swirls back and forth between modern New York, 1950's California, and late Edwardian England like a whirlpool. But its emotional effect is powerful and it is worth an effort.I found it had a profound impact on me once I started reading it as though I were listening to a piece of music. Themes rise to the surface, submerge, and reappear (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness; an interrupted attempt to run away from one's life; a suicide reconsidered)-just as in music. Let it wash over you rather than analyze it, and you will be well rewarded."
2,Not recommended,"I picked this book up at the airport bookstore before an overseas flight based on its numerous awards. It was 200 pages of whining, depicted people totally devoid of courage, and was sickeningly sentimental. I hated it."
1,Couldn't wait to put it down,"I'll have to side with those that were disappointed with this book. It was our Reading Group's selection for June. I think that it is going to get roasted. It reminded me of a bad art film that centers on the bleakness of our existence. It was beautiful in spots, interesting when it talked of how creative people create, but weak as a whole. I'll give those familiar with Virginia Woolf the benefit of the doubt that Cunningham has done something clever here with her ideas. I can't help but to think that they are probably strong enough to stand by themselves."
3,Nice enough,"An impressive exercise, but an exercise nonetheless, this short novel never quite manages to stake its own artistic territory. Cunningham has beautifully pared his prose, but the effect remains one of effort rather than inspiration. Stylistically, it's intense but rather sterile, and the characters' alienation, without compelling narrative as its backdrop, lacks larger resonance--the story which Cunningham does supply, of lost love and longing, is anodyne in the extreme, and ultimately unnecessary."
1,So Very Disappointing,"An incredibly dull, stagnant book with very suburban prose. Cunningham follows around three women, one of whom is Virginia Woolf, and riffs on literature, memory, and ""Mrs. Dalloway."" But nothing really happens here, though Cunningham's prose is lovely enough to carry the book's first third; characters aren't well developed, the prose grows wearisome, and he's no match for the master. I don't understand these hyperbolic reviews; I'd rather read something that takes more real risks."
2,I had trouble finishing it,"I had what is like an allergic reaction to this book.I have this fear that if I don't say something this might be mistaken for a great novel...there is no great poetry here; just fascination with death and death.My reaction was like litmus paper:this is a disgustingly self centered book about:1) suicide2) homosexuality3) "" painfully susceptible sensibilities"""" Virgina Woolf put a stone into the pocket of her coat , walked into a river and drowned.""Over and over and over...It makes you afraid of reading Virginia Woolf.Well, the book made me want to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf anyway."
3,Woe is Me,"Okay, I get the Virginia Woolf homage, but for crying out frickin' loud, the three women illustrated in this novel are poster girls for a Woe is Me sobfest. For me, this was distracting. On the bright side, Mr. Cunningham's flair for the adjective was worth the read."
1,"Dense, discombobulated tale of self-absorbed, whiny people.","I had to re-read entire sections of this book in order to figure out what was going on---I'm still not sure. After speaking to several fellow readers, I know I'm not alone. And I'm flabbergasted by all the praise. Is this writer so brilliant that we mere mortals are unable to decipher his meaning? Or is this just a very bad book that somehow caught the interest of the literary elite, (intellectual snobs)---it won the Pulitzer. Guess it's over my head.T"
5,Woolf Nut A-Go-Go,"This fine book from this fine man has turned me into a mighty fine Woolf nut. I was a milder variety nut before this. Liked Woolf but yada-yada. I have now gone on a veritable Woolf bender. So this is another result of Cunningham. His book is the powerful type that sets its readers on lovely, unplanned discovery tours of great literature. Uh-huh! Go baby!"
3,too contrived,"I thought this book did a disservice to Virginia Woolfe by transposing her brilliant and poignant novel (Mrs. Dalloway) onto a modern day plot. Substituting character names, locations, and various major and minor sub-texts (AIDS in place of post-war trauma; a movie star in place of a queen) does not create an original novel (or even a thought-provoking sequel). I don't think you can ""cover"" literature in the same way you can cover a song.The other two sections of the book, which dealt with the 50's housewife who read Mrs. Dalloway, and the fictional account of V. Woolfe writing the novel, were much more enjoyable and well done."
3,"Clever, not insightful","I agree completely with Michelle McSweeney's review -- Cunningham has simply imitated Woolf's great novel in some chapters and, although he writes well, has failed to give us anything extraordinary in the other chapters, although they are intermittently engaging. The book contains no insights that Woolf had not already provided 75 years ago, and it certainly achieves nothing new. I found the ""Mrs. Dalloway"" chapters, which just replicate the original with different names and places, plain irritating. Also irritating was the heavy-handedness of such events as Laura Brown's afternoon in a room of her own . . .Just read Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and call it a day!"
4,"Interesting, unique good read","The Hours was an enjoyable and challenging book which alternated among 3 sets of characters in each chapter. This one is not brain candy, but a true novel that makes you think. Each set of characters is unsatisfied with some element of life. The characters were very alive with real emotion: the frustration of the suburban mother who just wants to be alone to read; the confusion of a lesbian mother who feels like a sell-out; the emotional breakdown of an author who is both brilliant and fragile. I absolutely loved the ending of this book. Definitely worth reading, but not my favorite book that I plan to re-read."
5,Ode to Ms. Woolf,"I LOVED this novel, not only for its beautifully interwoven stories, but for the depth of its writing. The title is subtle and curious, yet so specific to the book. Michael Cunningham truly has captured ""moments in time""-those instantaneous thoughts which often pass through the mind too quickly to acknowledge, that minute world between the semi-conscious and recognition. As with Ms. Woolf's writing, life is fully realized, and the reader is left with eyes open and senses acute. Unique and thought-provoking!"
1,What's the point of this?,"I try, I really do. I read the hyped books and the ones that win awards. I NEVER like them. I wonder why? Probably because they are boring books and never really go anywhere. Or the subject isso esoteric and contrived that it seems the purpose of writing isfor the author to snare some award.What was the purpose of The Hours? A shared love of Virginia Wolff? No plot, no climax, no ""anything."" It was a waste ofmy hour to read it."
3,Non-woolfe fans beware,"Maybe it's because I'm unfamiliar with Virginia Woolfe, but this book didn't do much for me. There were a lot of literary allusions to Woolfe's writing which I did not get. I think that if you didn't read Woolfe and or if you don't like her style, then you won't like this book much. I would save it for the future after you've come to appreciate Virginia Woolfe. I myself am not a Woolfe fan, I've tried to read Orlando twice now, and each time I'm bogged down by the language, and Orlando is supposed to be Woolfe's most accessible book. You could still follow The Hours because it does have a plot of its own. The three women in the book eventually all tie together in the end. Clever people will figure out the ending 1/2 way or 3/4 of the way through the book though."
3,Pretentious but interesting,"The writer tries a little too hard to prove he's a good writer, and nothing turns me off more than unnecessary grandeur in writing. At least the interwoven stories are interesting, though the connection between the present day Clarissa and post-war Mrs. Brown is so obvious, it's not much of a surprise at the end."
3,A 'Hamlet' book,"I found this work a 'Hamlet' book in terms of thought vs. action (too much of one and not quite enough of the other). Cunningham dives the undercurrents of the most mundane of events to divine the essence and meaning of life as we know it.While very strong stylistically, fluent and well-written, the book seems to dip into the 'tell' as opposed to the 'show' region now and then. The characters tend to lay their thoughts open to us, straight as railroad tracks, utterly sure of what they mean; at such times, they turn into vessels for Cunningham's philosophy rather than realistic characters in their own right.Therefore, I found it a little too contrived and self-aware; but still, a thought-provoking and insightful read."
2,an interesting phenomenon,"I read in the NY Times that the author proposed a boxed set, his book and ""Mrs. Dalloway."" I think this is a bad idea, for the following reason. I, who had never been able to stomach Virginia Woolf as a young man, read ""Mrs. Dalloway"" first. I found it profound, amusing, wonderful, and I revised my opinion of Woolf utterly. Turning to ""The Hours,"" I felt it was an interesting failure, drowned, as it were, in the light shimmering in my mind from Mrs. Woolf's incandescent prose. I imagine the Pulizer committee made up of English professors who, having failed to persuade students to appreciate Woolf, were overcome by the happy memories of their long ago love affair with ""Mrs. Dalloway."" In the end I found the two books about as successful as the parties each bring us to. Then again, my profound thanks to Mr. Cunningham for sending me to Ms. Woolf."
3,"Good, but not very original.","I can't share the excitement over this book. It just didn't live up to its press. And didn't anyone catch the references to Doris Lessing's story, To Room Nineteen? About a woman who must rent a motel room to have some time alone. You see, this book is well enough written, hence the three stars, but so unoriginal it's discouraging how much people have applauded it. I do think the author has a great novel in him somewhere. It's just not this one. He needs to let go of his literary diva worship and take the plunge into originality. I know... he's laughing all the way to the bank, but that's my opinion."
3,Tired,"Frankly I am tired of this kind of ""seamless masterpiece"" which is so seamless that none of the characters were ever developed to the greatest extent possible. I have read Mrs. Dalloway, I know Virginia W., but I was disappointed in this Pulitzer Price winner. I expected more."
2,Pulitzer-Schmulitzer...,"Okay..I have to admit that the only reason I bought this book was because it had been so highly reviewed and of course the Pulitzer didn't hurt either..I thought, hey, I'm hip. I read relevant books and literature. Unfortunately, I really didn't feel this book packed the powerful punch I was hoping for. The characters were caricatures. Not even inventive ones. The twist at the end was okay, but by then I felt a bit cheated.I'll admit, Cunningham's prose was stylish and well designed, but a pretty package is only good if you don't open it. So, buyer beware. I'm a bit too jaded to fall for some romantic notion of running from my life because the world is spinning too fast. This book might well have been a breakthrough had it been written forty years ago. We're all too clever by now to get swept up by lesbians and suicide..Still, any finished book is worth something to somebody..."
2,The (boring) Hours,This book is totally contrived and I cannot BELIEVE it won the Pulitzer. What a bunch of drivel.
2,Entirely ho hum,"The characters are a mere veneer. Homosexuality, Virginia Woolf and depression are insufficient in and of themselves to be interesting. I finished it in an effort to see why it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. I suppose it was the linking theme of Virginia Woolf throughout the three stories. Time is precious; use it to read another book."
1,dont waste your time on this book,I started to read this book with great expectations. It received many good reviews and was a best seller. the first few pages were fine. The story seemed to be heading somewhere. But as i continued reading the story became much too boring and pointless. What is the bottom line of the story? I feel that reading this book was nothing but a waste of time. It is the worst book i've read in years.Do yourself a favour-don't read it!
1,More Like Days...,"Or weeks, or even YEARS. This was the longest and most boring thing I have read since anything ever. I do not reccomend this book. Resist the hype."
3,Another Disappointing Pulitzer Prize Winner,"I have read so many novels lately, secure in the obviously naive notion that they have to be great because they were awarded the Pulizter Prize for fiction. These include ""Kavalier & Clay,"" ""Breathing Lessons,"" ""Empire Falls,"" ""Gilead,"" ""The Known World,"" ""Middlesex,"" and this novel. While all of these works are ambitious and at times astonishingly good, they are nevertheless disappointing. In this novel, the author almost succeeds in weaving together the lives of three characters against the backdrop of Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Mr. Cunningham gives us snippets of brilliance, but on the whole his novel is contrived and self-important."
3,Amazingly written,"Michael Cunnigham wrote this novel extremely well, each sentance is enticing and outstanding. I loved how he described nature, the characters and their lives. Each story keeps you hooked and every passing moment you wonder in the end what will happen to these very confused and lost characters. Very good read.The reason I gave it three stars is because of it's homosexual content which I could of done without."
3,3-in-1,"I felt myself to be at a disadvantage after reading other reviews, lacking in knowledge of Virginia Woolfe's background. For that reason, I don't think the novel spoke as clearly to me, although Ms. Woolfe was my favorite character of all.The author weaves three characters together, visiting each with their unique personalities, until they join together at the ending chapter. I found myself frequently wondering how Mr. Cunningham found his way to such a novel approach. However, I probably would not reread THE HOURS, for all its vivid imagery, from dead sparrows to roses. I couldn't seem to locate the depth in those who lived among the pages."
3,"Tasty, yet unsatifying","The prose is good. The descriptions border on excellent. But is it a steady framework on which to build engaging plot and believable characters? I think not. In the inscription, Cunningham discloses his intentions of writing the story in the image of a cave, with 3 diverging paths which converge within the depths of the mountain. Yeah,but the cave is about 3 feet deep, maybe. I found no depth to any of the characters, nor did I really care what happened to any of them. My emotional reaction to Richard's suicide was that of ""thank GOD, some action, finally!"" Before I read the book, I was intrigued by the so-called ""surprise ending"" but found myself totally unsatisfied and unsurprised in the final chapter. It's a good read sheerly for the word candy, but if you are looking for a committment rather that a one night stand, this book isn't for you."
1,The Hours,"I didn't find this book engrossing or even challenging. In fact, it was an effort for me to finish reading this rather smallish book. I found the writing to be superficial and the characters undeveloped. Of course, the connections among the three women were obvious and there were no surprises to be discovered. Anyone familiar with the Bloomsbury Group and specifically Virginia Woolf is aware of everything included concerning her life and her writing. The similarities among the three characters were so tenuous and the characters so underdeveloped (I felt no attachment to any of them), that although I am aware of the rave reviews, I find it impossible to agree with them. If this is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, then our writing establishment, and our civilization by extension, are in deep trouble."
1,A juvenile exercise.,"I found this book to be pretentious, boring, sophomoric and most of all, contrived. Not one sympathetic character in it- and oh! all that purple prose. Too bad the PEN/Faulkner and Pulitzer judges were taken in."
3,Doesn't Take Wing,"The Hours is a beautifully written homage, but in the end it does only make you crave the real thing. Virginia Woolf uses the technique to soar into her character's subconscious, the Hours doesn't fly except as an homage to her genius."
3,A window into Virginia Woolf's soul,"I didn't realize until I actually picked it up and started reading that the author of ""The Hours"" was a man. Given the subject, I just assumed the author would be female.It was a strange book; it didn't completely hook me, but definitely engaged me. The story lines wound around each other in a delicate way, like separate vines up a wall. Touching, related, but not entirely one. The depth of Cunningham's exploration into Virginia Woolf was lovely. He found a place in himself to write from her; to know her from her. The other two stories were somewhat less poetic, but certainly interesting. However I felt Mrs Brown's storyline was somewhat unfinished. I would say modern Clarissa's story seemed the most concrete.I guess this book seems to me more like a painting or a feeling than a book. It left me with a taste of something, but it's like vapor. Not completely tangible."
4,Beautiful art,"I enjoyed the reading of this novel immensely. I usually read fiction with a goal of become deliciously lost within the narrative. This book did that but, while I usually don't look to appreciate prose as art unto itself, the prose and language in this book were crafted beautifully. Some of the paragraphs are stunning. The forward is an artistic achievement in that sense and hooked me into the rest of the book. The stories of the book flow well enough for eager reading but this is also a message book. The message is that all people's lives are dominated by the ordinary passage of each day but most us are consoled with the memories of the rare hours of our lives when everything clicks. When we are what we want to be and we see life as a green field before us. Some people have more of those hours than others. Some loudly pretend they do. Most of us treasure a few and that's enough."
4,Great Writing,"It is the most beautiful written book I have read for my book club this season. The story line and characterization, however, left something to be desire."
1,Author's reading detracts from story,"I have listened to many audio books, and this is the first that I've listened to that has been read by the author. This CD is an example of why most books are read by professionals. Michael Cunningham delivers his prose in a manner that sounds very affected- pausing at frequent intervals to perhaps emphasize importance, ending nearly every sentence with a vaguely questioning, melancholy inflection. It is nearly impossible to sit through the almost ten hours of his reading. The writing is exceptional, but his reading of it is so pretentious and distracting, that it is almost too excruciating to listen to."
2,So depressing I could barely get through it,"If I had only one word to sum up this book it would have to be ""depressing"". Even the author/narrator sounded depressed as he read this book in a monotonous tone. I found this story a very difficult one to stick with as the book was populated with people who were unhappy, suicidal and unsatisfied with their lives. It left me feeling extremely gloomy. I most definitely will not be renting the movie as I don't care to relive the story again."
5,5 stars are not enough.,"If you are a fan of long rambling novels full of characters and scenes superfluous to the plot, then this is probably not the novel for you. Multilayered and spanning the better part of the last century, ""The Hours"" is a beautifully articulated exercise in imagination and literary economy. Author Michael Cunningham has fashioned a triptych of stories dealing with three women - a writer, a reader and a character - in a stunning hommage to his favorite writer, Virginia Woolf, and his favorite novel and literary character ""Mrs. Dalloway.""This novel, a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a masterpiece of succinctly expressed thoughts and ideas - each absolutely subervient and germane to the plot. ""The Hours"" is a uniquely rendered work, eloquent, compelling and compassionate. Novels of this quality don't come along often, perhaps only once in a generation."
3,average read,"I brought this book because I had heard great reviews from the movie. I can't say the book was bad at all, especially because Cunnigham has an extremely unique style of writing. However, it did seem to work against him at times. The book is descriptive and captures the raw emotions and thoughts of each character, but it is filled with paradoxes and can be quite boring to read. I would recommend giving it a try, but clearly not a novel that many may enjoy."
2,Quite a Disappointing Award Winner,"I expected more brilliance from a Pulitzer prize winner. Although I found the structure of the novel well-crafted, little else impressed me: the prose was flat, totally without poetry or lyricism, and the characters, shallow. They needed to possess ""humanity, humour, depth,"" as Woolf suggests in the diary entry quoted in novel's prelude. She says that structure alone isn't enough. Since he included that quote in his book, Cunningham, surely, understood that, too. He just couldn't pull it off. For its structure alone, I would recommend it to most readers; however, I can't believe it won the Pulitzer prize.It's not that good."
2,Cover does not hold up.,"Although it fits the smoker well and stays in place, this is not a good cover for the price. The cover is a rather lightweight vinyl that started fading immediately after I installed it and was all gray in a couple of months even though it's only in the sun a few hours a day. It barely lasted a year before it started tearing. Unfortunately, I've looked everywhere for a sturdier, better quality cover and cannot find any offered and, because of the odd shape of the Bradley smoker, covers designed for other products won't fit the unit well. So, here I am, ordering another poor quality cover because it's ""the only game in town""."
2,Fades too fast,"This sun bleaches out way too fast, even for Arizona (6 months) and the material does not hold up well. Find an alternative for your money"
1,Falls apart after a year,"Within 2 months (summer and in direct sun light), it was discolored to a very bright grey, at the end of the year it started tearing apart. The plastic it is made of became stiff and simply broke apart.For the money they are charging, this cover is not worth the money and I do not recommend buying this. Bradley normally has a good quality - I am very happy with my smoker, but this cover is a huge disappointment."
4,Nice cover,"This is a nice little cover and it fits the smoker with the side smoker attached very nicely. I wish it were made of a heavier material, but we'll see how it lasts."
4,All Weather Smoker Cover,Made of very soft or flexible cloth materialfor easier handling (covering or uncovering) of the Smoker.
2,A good tarp and a length of bungee would be better,"Put this on my smoker yesterday as it was threatening rain. It rained lightly for a few hours and when I took the cover off this morning, there was moisture on the smoker. It doesn't seem to do a good job at all."
2,Didn't last very long,"For the price, this cover didn't last very long (about a year before folding to the weather...totally faded, rips and tears; NC environment). Best bet is to buy an $8 cover at Home Depot rather than spend three times as much. The Bradley cover does look a little better than my recent Home Depot purchase but I feel the cover should have lasted longer."
5,Well Made Cover,I bought this cover so as to use to cover my 4-rack Original Bradley Smoker while being stored in my shed between smoking jobs. I was impressed at how heavy the material was that they used for the cover so I have left my smoker outside a few times during rain here in the Northwest. Removed the cover and checked to see if the rain penetrated through the material but the smoker was still dry. Indeed it is an All Weather Cover. It does have a draw string on the bottom of the cover that will tuck the cover under the smoke generator so it will not blow the cover up the side of the smoker during a moderate wind. I will still opt to keep the smoker covered in my shed during the winter between my smoking jobs. I would recommend anyone with a Bradley Smoker to get this cover to fit their smoker.
5,"FIT my Mastercraft 30"" PERFECTLY","Looked for a cover to fit my Mastercraft, as they were ""out of stock"". Found this one. It fits my 30"" smoker PERFECTLY, almost like it ""made"" for it. Keeps my unit dry and clean. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. Heavy duty and well constructed. Although I wont leave it out in the snow over the winter, I'm sure it would be OK to do so.I just dont think keeping smokers like this out over a hard winter is good. So it and the cover will go into the shed until spring."
1,Doesn't last!,"My smoker cover has seen two seasons and is it completely destroyed. It does get a lot of direct sun, but the covers on my two grills are older and in much better shape. Bradley should invest in a better grade of vinyl on their next generation cover."
1,very odd,"This is an odd book. The author attempts to explain OO development management by creating an object model of the concepts within the development process. It is an intriguing idea, but it doesn't work. The object model provides no insight that I can see to the development process, and it makes it painful to read, even when he is explaining simple situations. The one valuable part is the detailed review of other process methods (e.g. SEI's). But that alone was not worth the price, at least for this reader."
5,Strange but worth it,It's a unique style of writing. More or less have to understand what he is saying and not how. Very deep but well worth the read.
2,"good book , bad kindle version","The book as written by William Walker Atkinson is pretty good. The annoying part is that when they scanned the book to make the kindle version there is a typo on just about every single page! It actually gets pretty frustrating. This book is out of copyright time so whatever they are charging for this version is pure profit for whoever is doing it , the least they could have done is perhaps proofread it to correct their mistakes. I believe there are other kindle versions of this book, you may want to try a different one then this."
3,Hard to read,"This may be a detailed discussion of the topic but it is very hard to slog through. Reading this book is like talking to someone who can't get to the point. To get through the back half of the book I started reading the first paragraph of each chapter, then the first line of each paragraph and the conclusion page. I hate when authors feel the need to use more than one analogy or story to drive home a point. Its a waste of text. No doubt the author knows what he wants to say. I just wish he could say it better."
3,Buy from another publisher: this review is of the physical book not the written words in it.,Maybe the copy I received was able to sneak past quality control. The printing on the pages are poor. It looks like a bad photo copy (see picture). On some pages words are missing. the ink is either too heavy or the ink too light the words are hard to make out. You may want to buy this book from another publisher besides Book Jungle. I will review the book when I am finish reading it.
5,Redemption,"This book has it all. Sexy protagonists, murder, intrigue & erotica. Set in jail, two women find themselves drawn to each other despite the abhorrence that surrounds them. Very well written by this new, up and coming writer. Recommended highly."
2,Wishful thinking,"Having carried two cameras (Nikons with Nikor zooms) to give me a range of 28 to 300mm, I thought it would be great to have the same range and only have to lug one camera. Being a loyal Nikon fan and user, I was somewhat leary of the Tamron Brand. I did some research and used the lens to take some test rolls. The test results were fine. The Zomm action worked very hard in the beginning & Within six months it was so loose that you could not hang it over your shoulder without locking the lens, because it would extend to 300mm on its own. I just returned from Alaska and the Tamron was not satisfactory in my opinion. Half way through the trip it started to take longer for the auto-focus to focus - if it did at all. During a glacier trek it was damaged - I'm not getting it fixed! I'll lose 100mm and buy the Nikon 28-200 Zoom."
2,Get the Nikon 70-300 instead,"This lens does have some nice features, the most notable of course is the ability to go from a semi-wide angle shot all the way to 300mm and zoom in. The lens has a locking feature that allows you to lock the zoom.Unlike the other reviewers I was not happy in the least with the prints I got using this lens. I took six test rolls of film and found the pictures to be sub-par. The auto focus on this lens seems to be the main culprit. Even in conditions with good lighting this lens seemed to be forever focusing, and half the pictures still seem to lack focus. The color separation was horrible on the prints. Until I bought this lens I never had a problem getting good pictures using automatic settings on my camera (N70).I brought this lens back and bought the Nikon 70-300 and continued using my Quantray 28-80 for the majority of my shooting. The difference was noticeable, immediately noticeable. The Nikon lens focus's quicker, and the prints come out a heck of a lot better."
3,Good value,"This is an attractive set and seems fairly well made. My only complaint is the comforter is somewhat small for a California King. I believe it measures 91X101. It covers, but not much to spare. The sheet and comforter are a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets have softened a bit with washing. I believe it is a good value for the money."
1,Oh mY gOd!,A friend of mine told me to get this cd cause he knows I like agressive metal a lot. First of all the production is not that good in my opinion. And I really can't enjoy nothing from this band since there's no melodies et no break from the pounding drums and screaming vocals. But the good point is that Neuraxis is a bunch of talented musicians and I respect them for doing metal for so long! If neuraxis could just add more feelings and vitality to their songs i'm sure that many new fans will join their army.

5,A Lesson in Music Appreciation,"Like many others, I first became aware of Mason Williams through his hit, ""Classical Gas"" while growing up listening to my dad's vinyl collection. It wasn't until my mid 20s that I had a chance to listen to the album in it's entirety and I am glad it took me that long because I don't think I could have appreciated the guts it took for Mason Williams to create such elaborate arrangements consisting of classical, pop, bossa nova, and rock with his own touch of humor here and there. The Mason Williams Phonograph Record is an album I think that was a head of it's time and being a musician myself, I find it difficult at times to let go of trying to create music that I think people will appreciate because it's popular as apposed to creating music that is ""me"". Thank you, Mason Williams! I found your album a true inspiration!"
2,One good song,"I love Classical Gas, and this is the version I expected. I was really disappointed in the rest of the album. I guess I was hoping for similar accoustic guitar and such. Lame vocals in many songs. I am going to have to break down and get a CD burner so I can keep this song in my carousel along with other singles from albums aren't good (like Don Henley's ""Boys of Summer"")."
2,More a curiosity than a keeper,"Mason Williams would compose musical jokes on his guitar for his stand-up routines. As a sketch writer for the Smothers Brothers, his ""Classical Gas"" was the theme for a display of classic paintings on the show. On the ablum, the gags in ""Overture"", ""Dylan Thomas"", and ""The Prince's Panties"" mix poorly with the other earnest attempts and make for a very uneven album. The combination of french horns and guitar riffs do make for a nostalgic return to late 1960's theme muic. 2 stars for the overall album."
2,Not very good Hackett,"I was surprised with this CD by Hackett. It is not what I expected from an ex-Genesis member. The recording is not good either. There are moments when one cannot hear the lyrics...! Too bad, Steve..."
4,Buy this book for the photos!,"From A to Z, this photo - filled book will keep true crime fans interested for hours. Mitchell has put together a collection of fascinating short summaries of Hollywood crimes from the well known to the obscure. There are all kinds of extra tidbits in this book including descriptions of the Serial Killer Auto Graveyard, the haunted Queen Mary oceanliner, and photos of famous stars' gravestones.(these photos could have been clearer) Background of the text is a bit distracting but arty at the same time. This is a book you can leaf through like a magazine or just sit down and start reading. Good job. I'm holding on to my copy!"
5,Hollywood Death Scenes,"Couldn't put down this thrilling and comprehensive account of mass murders and much more. Well researched book that kept me intrigued and amazed at such utter barbaric and senseless acts committed in the luxurious Land of Hollywood (to the pretty, gifted and fortunate people)."
2,why no detail about how many pads per pack?,"As i'm shopping for post-its, i've noticed quite a few of these item descriptions neglect to describe either the number of pads per pack or the number of sheets per pad. I've seen the same shopping for these items in the store, so it's no slam on Amazon. Just makes for a frustrating shopping experience."
3,GE 6' S-Video cable,"It looked good, however I did not use the cable because I was unable to hook it to my video recorder."
1,Deceptive advertising,"The cable pictured has gold ends. I just received this product and the ends are not gold, they are silver colored. Sounds like ""bait and switch"" to me. I am returning this item. Very happy with Amazon's return policy, though. It's why I shop on Amazon."
3,"This is ok,but can't connect it to my laptop audio....",this s-video cable is fine but the problem is with the audioi couldn't connect the audio ports to my laptop audio portsi am just using it as a video cable
3,Okay product,It does what it's supposed to do. i don't have nothing else to say about this.The service was okay the shipment was what they say so I'm satisfied
4,Good place to start,"If you're just getting into the music of glam-rockers Cockney Rebel, this is the CD for you. All the essential tracks are here, including the classic ""Tumbling Down"". Since the first 2 (and best) Cockney Rebel albums aren't available on CD yet, this is your only option to get such great tunes as ""Sebastian"" and ""The Psychomodo"", and singles like ""Judy Teen"" and ""Mr. Soft"". A little too much from the later, post-75, years but it's still a good compilation. Steve Harley used to be very proud of the fact that no guitars were used on his albums, but with the great violin and keyboard playing, you won't miss 'em either. Imagine a more garage version of Roxy Music with a David Bowie fixation. Great stuff for fans of glam rock."
1,Divide by two,"For those who need assistance in dividing by two, this tape measure is ideal. The first time that I stretched this tape measure out to over fifteen feet, it came apart. I don't believe that the manufacturer or Amazon should call this contractor grade. It may be novelty grade, but contractor grade? 'Fraid not."
3,A MANUAL OF ANGLO-CATHOLIC DEVOTION,"A MANUAL OF ANGLO-CATHOLIC DEVOTIONThis beautiful new book is probably just what the English Church needed. I must say that I'm disappointed that it is geared to the Church of England and not to the greater Anglican Communion.Unfortunately most of the devotions are in the Rite II style (Contemporary language), including the Psalter section. I think there could have been more of a balance between the two styles. Even the ""traditional"" Mass section has elements of revision.The illustrations in the Rosary section are lovely, but what happened to the traditional Gloria Patri? I am most impressed with the inclusion of the Marian Litany, the 'Litany of Loreto'. The Our Lady section is much too small and should have included other litanies, perhaps including some of the Franciscan devotions to the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary and more hymnody.The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of the scriptures should be avoided as not all Christians accept this version."
5,Perfect Anglo Catholic prayer book to date,"Just a wonderful and great prayer book for a Anglo Catholic to own. It as, if your in a catholic prayer book and a Catholic could use it, if he or she wanted too. It would be nice in the future, if they could do American verison of it as well over the years to come. I have two copies and i use them alot, but I like use many prayer books to keep my faith open to all Christian tradtions."
5,Anvil,Played this from front to back and every track on this CD Kicks Ass! Lips and the boys are awesome!
1,I Hate it. Not how it looked in the picture,"i wanted the one in the picture, but apparently it wasn't at all. it was some piece of crap. im very disappointed. :("
1,You have GOT to be kidding,"I don't know who Dark Wolf is, but he must have shares in the company who makes these mini-rubber chickens.These are some of the ugliest, cheesiest and most poorly manufactured novely items I have ever seen.Do yourself a favour. Get something else."
1,Much smaller than expected,"I was very disappointed with these little chickens. I wanted them as a party favor for my son's barnyard birthday party. I didn't realize they are extremely tiny - really only meant for use with the chicken flinger thing -- they should be sold together! Anyway, I will just use them in a scrapbooking project of for some odd card, so it's not a total loss."
5,Excellent guide,"I've been a fan of the Magic Lantern Guides since I bought one with my original digital Rebel. Much less boring than the manual, much less fluff than some of the other after-market guides. And the fact that this one covers both my cameras quite well makes me a very pleased consumer."
2,Disappointed too,"This book offers very little about these cameras that is not in the manual. What it does offer that is not in the manual are general discussions that any photographer owning one of these cameras would know. I had hoped to get an understanding of how and when to use the features that are unigue to these cameras, a discussion of the custom functions and personal functions for example. The coverage of these subjects is not much more than a list of the functions and what their default setting are, just what's in the manual. Canon has a white paper that gives some of this information. You can find it at Photoworkshop http://photoworkshop.com/canon/EOS_Digital.pdf"
1,Disappointed,"Magic Lantern Guides:Canon EOS 1D markII by Adam Christopher is really diappointing. Cover looks great but the content was below standard. Looks like a copy / paste job from the manual.I have two previous Magic Lantern Guides for Canon EOS. Loved it! but this EOS-1D MarkII were so uninforming and low budgeted and it show it was done in a hurry.Mr Adam Christopher, I will never buy your books again and also advice my friends."
4,Expands on the User Manual,"I purchased this book because I wanted more information about my 1Ds MkII than the Canon user's manual contained. I was pleased that this book did expand upon the user's manual, and was clearly written. It follows the format of the Canon user's manual and I would guess that this book adds 15% of new information to the Canon manual...not a lot, but it really is a valuable 15%. I'm glad I bought it. This book is not written as a ""How-To"" guide. I want one of those, too, and will continue looking."
3,Magic Lanter Guide,"This book is written to cover a Pro Level camera body. Certainly a person who owns a pro level camera will not enjoy or make great use of this guide, any guide written by David Busch is far better"
1,Jibberish!,I got more out of the Canon Manual than I did the ML book. And the Canon instruction manual I have is written in Spanish. And I don't speak or read Spanish.
5,Great Tape Measure,"This tape is easy to read and understand. After taking it to work, other people were very interested in it. I work in a plant that makes crates for snowmobiles and use it all day, everyday."
1,"Stanley Digital Tape rules the ""centered"" readout feature.","I did not buy this tape because it does not give ""centered"" measurements like the Stanley IntelliTape Digital Tape does.Sometimes you want the center of a measurement and when you start dividing fractions in your head... well, things can go spinning.Instead, I just press a bottom and I have my ""center"" measurement now! No hassle, no time wasted. That feature is important to me -- someone else may never had need of such a feature.. good for them...."
5,Absolutely Incredible !!,This is the best version of the Dettingen Te Deum I've ever heard. Anyone who's a fan of classical choral music will absolutely love it!!
3,It's just O.K.,"The bag is much smaller than I expected...But with the price I paid, it's still a pretty good deal, I think."
5,"Handsome book , Full of great ideas","Fabulous book on decorating - using global style. Richly illustrated with numerous, wonderful photos. Offers fresh ideas and many suggestions on indoor, outdoor, every area of the home, how to incorporate eye-catching global accents and color palettes, offers numerous ideas to update a room via a major or minor makeover. A wonderful, up-to-date sourcebook of global style."
2,Lame. No useful advice and not enough pics to make up for it,"SOUNDS brilliant doesn't it? Who doesn't want to bring all the beauty and awe and memories of their global travels into their homes to interact with daily? This gives no useful, thoughtful, original ideas. It just blabbers to make a book. If you haven't got anything to say, you just like real style instead of all this mass produced cookie cutter crap, then you need a lot of photos and these are mediocre and too few to make up for the severe lacking in the writing section."
5,Great!,This is one of my absolute favorite books for incorporating ethnic and global items into your decor. I go back to this book over and over again and I feel like I always find something new.
1,Not what I expected,"Mario Batali Coarse GraterThe grater is held onto the frame with a series of tack welds. After about three months use (in my kitchen - not commercially) the welds started to break until the piece is unusable. I'll stick with Microplane from now on.This is a follow up to my previous review. Well, I emailed Italian Kitchen, which is the name of the company that markets the Mario Batali line, about the same time I wrote my first review. Since I haven't yet received a reply, I followed up with a second email to Customer Service on their website. If this is any indication of the quality of Mario Batali's products and customer service, I have to say he has lost a long time fan, and it goes without saying that I won't be purchasing any more products endorsed by him. I wish I could have rated this product with zero stars!!! I am sorely disappointed!!!"
4,Stedman's Concise Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions: Illustrated (Book with CD-ROM,"I bought this when I couldn't find my Mosby's Medical Dictionary. When I did find it, I decided to sell this book through Amazon. It isn't quite as extensive as the Mosby's, but it is a smaller book and not so bulky to take up space on the shelf or in a backpack. If you don't need a really extensive reference, this book is a good choice."
5,Mdical Manual,"This is great any definition you need is here. My son is a doctor and when he was in Med School he told me about this book and cd so I ordered it. I have used it many times through these few years. I have a large family and we had had a lot of serious health issues. Cancer- 5 different kinds Brain Tumors Heart Problems, Genetic Problems and other more comon things and it is nice to have this to refer to after having problems diagnosed and trying to understand things like hyper vs hypo things like that. Highly recommend. I would recommend the cd for your computer as many this are spelled a lot alike and that really makes it easy."
2,Content quality marred by poor print quality,"Light print on all pages pages fades into almost unreadably light in a few pages. The print quality of this booklet detracts from the content of this book. If you want some good information about clarinets, but don't mind straining your eyes with an inferior quality publication, this would be for you."
5,Book review,"This is a very good book. It is very old, 1958, yet it has a lot of excellent suggestions and instructions."
1,"Bad Drivers, Bad support","This product is horridly difficult to get working on OS X (Mac) products. The customer service is close to worthless. I am at the point of giving up and purchasing a competitor's product that actually works. My guess is that either Tascam is incompetent wrt software, or more likely the product is new enough that they haven't gotten it to work yet on all common OS's. (I would have given it zero stars, but it appears that one star is the minimum allowed)."
1,Look Elsewhere For A Working Audio Interface,"I have owned the US-144 for a little over a year and have rarely had a recording session that wasn't a headache. Apparently, the drivers are unstable making it unpredictable whether the unit will be recognized by my recording software, Garageband. So invariable I have to unplug my USB cables and plug them back in again, quit out out of Garageband and constantly reset Garageband preferences to select the US-144, turn off the Mac, download new drivers, delete old drivers, and this has been going on for over a year. One need only do a search of reviews on the US-144 to hear a chorus of complaints. The unfortunate thing is Tascam was once a brand you could trust for professional grade recording equipment. Tascam has discontinued the US-144 leaving loyal Tascam customers in the lurch. I am going elsewhere for a working audio interface and I recommend you do too."
3,"Good Product, Bad Service","Good product but forget about the CVPiano-Mini software working with the provided Cubase LE 4. They're not compatable. According to Tascam Tech Support you have to upgrade to a more advance version of Cubase. By the way, if by chance you ever call them, you'll most likely be surprised by their candor. Just try asking one of their reps to ever repeat, clarify, or amplify one of their typically one to five word answers to a question. You'll love the response. It sets a new benchmark of arrogance. Tascam gets my anti-matter J. D. Power award for 2009 in the category of ""we-don't-give-a-damn-what-you-think-of-us-sucka"". Way to go boys. Keep up the bad work."
1,Does NOT work with Vista 64 bit OS,"If you are using Vista 64 stay away from this interface. Even after downloading and installing the latest driver and firmware - 1.12 - there are still latency issues along with random snaps, crackles and pops......"
3,Us-144 USB,"The interface is great, very good deal the the software CUBASE LE IT is terrible, to old, easy to use but horrible to record. Very old software. You can buy it but be ready to buy a good software recorder."
2,It works as long as you don't run Vista...,"I have two PCs that are less than a year old, both with 7200rpm hard drives and max of 4GB RAM. One is a laptop running Windows Vista, the other is a desktop running Windows XP, both running 32-bit OS with dual core 2ghz intel core 2 duo processors.I was unable to setup the device on Vista without constant playback lag and popping within windows when monitoring sound via headphone jack on the device.However, this worked without as much trouble when using the same hardware on Windows XP. However, on Windows XP I still had a slight recording lag which is apparent when multi-track recording. I wasn't looking for a challenge, I wanted an audio interface that just works. This has been a challenge."
1,Simply does not work,The interface simply does not work. I agree with those who state that there are sound driver or other issues. A total waste of money. I ended up with an Apogee Duet and a MAC Notebook. Part of the issue may simply be windows PC and these types of audio interfaces and reflect the superiority of Mac vs Windows for audio recording. But I've spent fruitless hours trying to get clear audio out of TASCAM when hooked to a PC. Run don't walk away from this device.
3,It has been difficult in the short time I've had it,"My major issue is that it comes with driver 1.11 which has a latency issue. For example; when I play a key on my MIDI controller,M-Audio Keystation 88ES Midi Controller, the sound is not in synch with the key press. I am usingCakewalk 10-CSHX7.00-10C Sonar Home Studio 7XL - Windowsas my recording software. If I upgrade the driver to Tascam's latest, 1.12, then the latency issue goes away, but a more obnoxious crackling noise is heard, so I reloaded 1.11 and settled for what I believe is the best middleground latency.Afetr a few hours of understanding just how to use it, it is proving to be a good fit for me. If I was to do it all over again I probably would pick a PC sound card based interface with a dongle that has XLR and other jacks.It is a good lokking, solid unit, with very nice rubberized dial controls.This is part of the Home Recording Studio I put together for the Family this Christmas."
4,Sinatra's the best... this album is okay,"Softly as I Leave You reflects the influence of overproduced '60s music on the greatest vocalist in American music. As always, Sinatra sings beautifully throughout, but some of the material here is not up to the performance. ""Here's to the Losers"" and ""Come Blow Your Horn"" are fun, and the title track is something of a classic.""Suddenly"" is just a silly song with worse lyrics, though; even the Chairman can't save this one from obscurity. ""Pass Me By"" is worse.Any Sinatra album is a treat (except maybe Duets I&II), and 'Softly' has some moments, but for Sinatra at his later best consider September of My Years and Basie and Sinatra at the Sands.Recommended, but with reservations!"
5,Paul Mitchell Freeze & Shine,I love this hairspray. It holds all day and leaves hair clean and shiny. I have short hair and it is the best!
2,product questionable,"The product I received was not the origianl Freeze and Shine product that I have used in the past. I don't know if the product line has changed or if a different product was placed in the bottle I received OTHER than the orginal product. All I know is it was not the original Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray. It had a distinct Awaphui fragrance, which is not common with Freeze and Shine. Just sayin..."
4,Geraldine: a great actress,"Some of the scenes in this movie take you back to a place that once was...before the days of mass machinery and walmarts. It's a battle of generations. It's a slower paced movie but a keepsake. You're taken into a world of desiring to go back to your roots. Any person who's lived in the country but has experienced city life will, I think, appreciate this movie. The main character quotes scripture and the movie begins and ends with a hymn; all so unusual for hollywood. This movie reveals how much our world has changed."
5,F. Murray Abraham may have been right,"When F. Murray Abraham stood before the Academy and announced that Geraldine Page had won the Oscar for Best Actress, he called her ""the greatest actress in the English language."" Now that was over the top, yes, but Page was never better or more moving than in this brilliantly understated role. It serves as the capstone of a long and distinguished career, and every film lover owes it to himself or herself to see it, if only to understand how powerful and beautiful a simple, honest movie can be. It still chokes me up."
5,Wonderful,This is one of the best movies and stories that I have seen. The performances are wonderful and I would suggest this to anyone.
4,A compelling trip,"Geraldine Page won an Oscar for her portrayal of a widow living with her son and daughter-in-law, which is a crimp on her feisty style. She decides one day to pay a visit to the old homestead in Bountiful, Texas. So without telling anyone she goes down to the bus station and plunks what little money she has (is allowed to have) down on a ticket and is off on her little odyssey. Much of her life and heartbreak is told in flashbacks while she's on the bus, either in dream sequences or as she talks to passengers. It's very sentimental at heart, though it has something to say about dignity and age and, of course, about the value of one's roots. Very good in spots, though perhaps just a bit too leisurely."
5,Case Logic Home Collection Album,"Case Logic Home Collection Album, Capacity 96This is the perfect case for those looking to compact their media collections. How attractive it is was what first caught my eye. There is a hard case which inside has a soft binder that you pull out to put your CD's and DVD's into. Once the soft binder is back in the hard case your media is well protected. With a capacity of 96 the case isn't heavy like conventional cases that hold 200 plus. There is a small tab on the outside of the case that you can use to label what is inside, so at a glance you will know what is in each case.To date I now have 18 of these cases. Yes that may sound a little overboard but my DVD collection alone is over 1000 titles and I was running out of room for storing them. Since I started getting the cases for myself some friends and family were so impressed with them that they now have started getting them."
5,plenty of space,"I love this CD album. It is attractive and holds plenty of CDs, so I can continue adding to the album as I have more photo CDs. It seems to also be sturdy and durable."
4,Easy to follow,"The recipes in this book were very good, most of the ingredients were available, an overall great Italian cook book."
3,"Beautiful Book, but.....","Very lovely hardcover book with great photos, but his recipes feature items that would be a lot of work to get if you don't live in a metropolitan area (which I don't). I've had the book for a month now and still haven't made a dish from it, so that must say something!!!Think I would rather watch him on tv. I do like him very much, tho.... a true chef."
2,not what I expected,"I thought this would be a great bookI enjoy his show on occasionbeing 1/2 italian I looked forward to many recipes I remembered from growing upbut too many anchovies and octopus, eel and squidI understand that they live by the sea but some of the pictures turned my stomachI only found 20 or so recipes in a book of over 300 that I would ever makeI don't think I can find some of the ingredients and there were some I have never heard of !I am afraid I will be sending this one back"
5,Beautiful book,I love europeenne food so I'm always in search of new recipes. I bought this book few weeks ago and I love it. The book is beautifull and the recipes are absolutly delicious ! I would recommend it to anyone who wants new everyday recipes.I also bought Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher both book are great !
3,Not Simple,"The one thing I always noticed about Batali when watching his programs on FoodTV is that he is very caught up in the originality and authenticity of the food he creates. As a master chef and owner of a restaurant, you'ld expect nothing less. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate well to a cook book. I don't know why I bought this book sight unseen. Yes, Italians eat a lot of fish (I'm Italian), and this book has plenty of fish recipes keeping with Batali's authenticity slant. Unfortunately, I hate fish, and most of the other recipes in this book are not simple in the context of having readily available ingredients in your pantry or frig. If you plan on throwing a party and serving authentic Italian cuisine, this book is for you. If you just want to make something different than the same-old same-old on a Thursday night, look elsewhere."
5,Perfect birthday gift,"My husband is the cook in the family, and has wanted Mario's ""Molto Italiano"" cookbook for a long time. It came in time for his birthday, and he loves the basic Italian & country-style recipes. He has already tried the spaghetti sauce which we loved and is ready to try more.J. Hahn"
2,Photographs? hmm ...,"The photos in this book are not appealing at all, the food looks burnt and oily, the plates are of some weird color like dirty blue, the recipes are so so"
3,"Overall, Not Worth the Dough","I hate to be the one to say it, but this cookbook is one of those grand collections of recipes that aren't worth the amount of dough you will have to lay down for it. While yes, Italians enjoy sardines and smelt, most people do not. Exactly how often does one serve whole Eel? While this book is chocked full of recipes, most of them tend to be for a certain type of cook, one who is highly experienced and has the time and energy to hunt down strange ingredients. If you love Mario and find yourself in the aforementioned culinary category, then by all means, add this book to your collection. If you're looking for simple and fast Italian, try Giada's Everyday Italian."
3,A Major Disappointment,"This is the first Batali cookbook I have purchased and I have to say that I am really disappointed. What a major mistake to prioritize quantity of recipes over quality. Yes, there are 327 recipes in this book, but I found that the recipes are bland or at the other end of the spectrum, too unusual. I prefer Lidia Bastianich instead. Her style of writing is more precise, and the results are absolutely spot on. The only reason why I have not given this book a lower rating is because I have certainly not tried the majority of the recipes. However, I am not sure that I want to waste my time."
4,Another wonderful Italian book!,My Mom is Italian and her parents were from Italy. I recently went to Italy and realized how fresh and simple ingredients make a difference. This book is full of wonderful recipes using just that!
5,THE BEST BOOK BY A GREAT CHEF,"Mario has outdone himself, and each recipe is laid out simply (and mouthwateringly photographed!)..Baked Pasta with ricotta & ham...fettucine with lemon, hot peppers and pecorino couldn't be more delicious and easier to prepare."
5,I read it like a novel!,"I treated myself to this book for my birthday. I sat down and started reading like it was a lovely book one would curl up with by a fire. I love cookbooks that much though, so don't mind my odd ways! Now, one must have several napkins ready, because so many of these recipes should make your mouth water tremenously! Even my 8 yr-old was impressed with the seafood chapter. Imagine- a little girl enjoying photos of fish with their heads still on! I have made several of the recipes in this book, and I am totally pleased with how they came out. I am afraid that if I followed all of these, I might find myself in Mr.Batali's wieght division, but one needs to deviate every so often to the land of richness, don't you think? Everything can't be just broiled with a little lemon juice, please! Get this book and enjoy the pleasure Mario gives in sharing this wonderful food. Mangia!"
5,FIRST CHOICE IN ITALIAN COOKING !!,"If You're Into Luscious, Simple Italian Cuisine at its Heights, This Is It ! Antipasto, by far the largest chapter at 106 pages is a favorite. Mario Believes the best cooking is done at ""Nonna's House"" or at the house of the Matriarch living above the market place. This is my new first choice among Italian Cookbooks. The cooking is simple, but with no compromises. For Mario Fans, Put This Under Your Pillow At Night. Very Highly Recommended !!!"
3,Mario's Book,"It's a good book, I guess... but frankly I was looking for something a little more ""basic"". I am just beginning to cook for myself and I like Italian food. ( I wonder why...?! ) I need a book for a biginner and for simple things like spaghetti and meat balls, or how to prepare a marinara. It's not easy finding cook books for guys like me who just turned on a stove for the first time yesterday and has all of the standard recipes. I'm going to have a look at Guida De Leurentis' book next... She's good lookin' eh...!?"
1,Not what I expected,"Molto Italiano: 327 Simple Italian Recipes to Cook at Home was not what I expected and I wish I hadn't bought this cookbook. Living in the middle of nowhere in the Rocky Mountains I find that most of the ingredients are difficult/impossible to find and the recipes aren't necessarily ""simple"" to cook at home. Nor do most of them sound appealing. I'm sure this is a wonderful cookbook for the more experienced Italian cook and eater and it was my fault that I didn't delve more deeply into Mr. Batali's cookbook and realize it wasn't right for me."
2,Simple Italian Recipes to Cook at Home,"These recipes may be simple, but they are not ingredients that one would find at the local grocery store.I purchaced this cook book because I thought that it would be simple and ""every-day"" user friendly;not so simple."
5,Beautifull book,"I love European food in general but my favorites are Italian and French cuisine.I bought this book because the recipe is simple, delicious and beautiful. It's definitely one of my favorite Italian cookbooks.I also bought simple and simply delicious by Sylvie Rocher because it has recipes from all over the world.I will recommend those 2 books to all my friends!"
3,Great Recipes - If you can find boar,"It's a beautiful looking book, with several recipes that look very tasty, but it requires some ingredients that you certainly cannot find at your neighbourhood grocery store. Furthermore, although I am admittedly far from a professional chef, I do not think the recipes are all that easy to make, even if you can find the ingredients. But if you live in Soho, NYC and have access to specialty stores & are a pro in the kitchen, you probably find these recipes great & simple."
5,Not recommended for small spaces,"This thing is huge. At least twice the size of the compact version it replaced. So if you don't have lots of space to place it around your pond, buy the 16w compact instead.If you do have the space, though. It works very well. We've never had our pond water clear up that fast."
5,A Great Combination Set,This is *the* top of the line when it comes to combination sets. It is perfectly accurate and easy to read. It will provide many decades of service. The only fault I see is that the set doesn't come with a case.
3,Stars are for the Jobim songs only,"People would be sick of reading that this is half a good album , but it's true .It's for the first half that you should buy it - why miss out on the lovely interpretations Frank gives , especially if you love his earlier album with Jobim . It is true his pitching is more unsure on this album when he sings the Jobim songs , but the arrangements are superb and help you to forget that aspect of it . The lyrics are also exceptional as one would expect , which always brings the best out of Frank .Make a compliation with the first Jobim album and you've got a nice little collection !"
5,Funky Frank,"Frank at his funkiest and hippest. Aqua de Beber is a dancefloor killer. Very trendy, very late 60s/2006 chill-out."
3,Sinatra and Company,"Released in 1971,this was one of the last albums Sinatra released prior to his ( first ) retirement in 1972.As with most of his Reprise albums,this album has largely disappeared from the public conciousness.It is a mixed bag : side 1 ( of the lp ) contains sessions from the 1969 album with Antonio Carlos Jobim,the celebrated Brazilian creator of the bossa nova.This is good music,covering Jobim standards such as "" Drinking Water"" and ""One Note Samba"".Side 2,produced by Don Costa,is standard late-period Sinatra : easy listening versions of songs like ""Close To You"" and "" Leaving On A Jet Plane"",which just don't match the versions by the Carpenters and Peter Paul and Mary.Bland.So,if you like Sinatra,you will want this album.But if you're seeking the Genius,go back to the 50's Capitol albums.Colin Kerr"
5,An Excellent Gift,"This was given to me when I said Goodbye to an extremely distinguished dog of my own. It was perfect, just what I needed. For anyone who has a beloved canine friend, this poignant essay, in this beautiful form, is a must have."
5,A touching tribute for dog lovers everywhere!,"If you've ever loved a dog, you will connect on many levels with this exquisite book! I also recommend ""August Magic"" and ""Heart of the Savannah"" by Veronica Anne Starbuck as great reading for dog lovers!"
5,The Last Will & Testament of a Very Distinguished Dog,A treasure of a book for the dog lover dealing with the sadness of loss. Read it or give it to a friend. You will be doing a good deed.
3,It works,It boggles the mind that a wall mount such as this might not be able to do it's job. There are no engineering challenges in a device such as this. This one works fine. Only three stars because of the price. A couple pieces of stamped sheet metal should be nearly free. It's not like the unit volumes are low or anything.
3,Good wall mount but it came missing a piece.,I liked how easy it was to install and all that but the parts bag was missing a 4mm spacer. There was supposed to be 4 and there were only 3.
3,The rarest of Elvis soundtrack albums,"Shot in only two weeks, the film Tickle Me was United Artists' lifesaver. Even tho' Elvis got $750.000 plus half the profits, the filmcompany survived a bad period, because Elvis made the young pull out big bucks for a very flimsy movie...But he made up for it musically, even when he didn't have any new material to work with. The soundtrack to the film consists of material recorded and released between his return from the army and the year prior to the release of this film (1965).This album contains all these songs, in superb sound quality, and the songs are really a lot better than the movie would have people think. Add some nice alternate versions so you can hear Elvis the artist work his magic, and along with two actual 1965 radio commercials one finds him or herself holding a true collector's item!"
4,Nice picks if you're looking for specific colors,"If for some reason you're looking for a pick with a specific color, this is a nice set. The bright colors make them difficult to lose."
3,luck of the draw,"I own 4 coolies, and it seems that they came from 2 different batches. One set is great, but the other set is not as stretchy going over bottlenecks. The white paint has cracked, but it's still functional."
5,Love that Lasts,Wonderful book and should be required reading for all going into marriage. Also a great book to use in premarital counseling. Highly recommend this book for a biblical perspective of marriage. If helps to counter act what we see in the movies and what the world tells us is expected from a husband and wife.
5,STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY!!!,"In this book, King Smurf, one of the Smurfs declares himself king in Papa Smurf's absence (adroitely borrowing a theme from the Biblical story of King David and his son Absalom). Well, as you can imagine, chaos quickly ensues.Upon his return, Papa Smurf is horrified to find his little Mushroom Village transformed into an Orwellian Police State where black helicopters fly overhead and Smurfs are denied the right to bear arms.After an impassioned plea where he invokes everyone from Plato to Thomas Jefferson, Papa Smurf wins the hearts and minds of his fellow Smurfs and restores Mushroom Village to a peace loving democracy."
2,Hardly a classic,"a 60's curiosity at best...and that's about it! This CD has little to do with sunshine pop, the Beach Boys, Pet Sounds, or the Small Faces (who are the back-up band). Don't buy this CD based on any of that hype! While the music, arrangement & production are top-notch, the songs are not memorable. Where are the hooks, the killer choruses? There aren't any. The vocals are often buried and very average. The lyrics aren't noteworthy. Now there is an Anthology available...more of the same? The sound here is 60's pop all the way...the material however is average at best.If you want a real 60's masterpiece, pick up The Zombies classic ""Odessey & Oracle."""
4,"Some Dissaponting Aspects, But Still A Great Dimmu Product","Dimmu Borgir's latest DVD and VHS version ""World Misanthrofy"" is actually a pretty good buy even though Amazon.com ... gives you the cheaper version that dosen't fold out into an inverted cross and dosen't come with the BONUS CD!!! But it is still worth the cash when you weigh the pro's and con's.It is really dissaponting that the majority of the songs were off the new album ""Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia"" only because when they perfrom these songs live the keyboard effects just let you down, there is no orechstral aspect to this DVD unlike the CD.But the video quality is pretty good and the sound quality is also decent.The DVD does give you a deeper look into the band members lives which is really cool because these guys are really ... cool, but watch out for the interview with Shagrath after ""Indoctrination"" he dosen't speak English that well.Any devoted fan to Dimmu Borgir should surely should own this."
5,Excellent,"This is a cool DVD. The sound on disc 1 is flawed- i turned it up full volume and only had a medium sound. Disc 2 is too loud- I had the volume on 3 and that was plenty. The interviews and back stage is cool. I got the impression the band isn't nearly as evil as they try and be on stage in their personal lives. There's also not that much differance between the band and their fans. The image quality on one of the shows on disc 2 is flawed, with only a long shot and a fuzzy image. Also, Alt Lys is played with no vocals and keyboards. Even with these flaws, this is still an excellent DVD and a must-have for Dimmu fans."
4,Dimmu Borgir DVD,"Lots of great interviews and live footage. This is exactly what a death metal DVD should be. Save for Lamb of God's ""Killadelphia,"" this is probably one of the best DVD's I've purchased in quite awhile. A must-have for fans of extreme music."
3,Good But Could Have Been Better,"The concert clips on this DVD are all very good and entertaining. The backstage hi-jinx are fun but rather stupid. The film quality is the biggest problem with the DVD, it's rather grainy throughout the whole release. I think had Dimmu released an entire concert (instead of eight songs) and then kept the backstage stuff as a bonus feature (with longer interviews please!) this DVD would have been much better. As such it remains an entertaing but uneven package. The extras on disc two are good but suffer from some of the same quality problems as disc one does (though the bootleg footage of course is expected to be less than crystal clear)."
4,"Dimmu Borgir, for elite Dimmu fans!","The video quality of the dvd is nothing impressive, nor could it be, alot of the video was shot with a bad handheald digital camera. And the sound don't impress much either. So if you are just looking for a random heavy concert dvd with super sound, don't buy this! Buy the Slipknot dvd instead!But if you are like me: someone who is a big fan of the music and band, and want this dvd becuase it'll let you experience the band in a new way (backstage and on the road, and drunk), then this is for you. The 2 dvd's show you a great deal about the real Dimmu Borgir. The bonus cd has the supercool Devil's Path song, in a new version!"
4,Interesting travel through math history,"I liked the book because it is general enough for a non-expert, but has enough pointers to research in a topic of interest.It makes mathematics more humane - showing that the significant ideas take time to mature and to be understood by the scientific community.I recommend it to any engineering student wanting to know better the background faced by these geniuses when they discovered or created these topics.It doesn't get five starts because it is a little confusing sometimes, getting too deep into an issue before moving to a completely different one. I had to re-read some pages back to understand where the book was going. Except for that, a very nice book on general math history."
5,Brilliant,"Dr. Livio has followed up his last smash, The Golden Ratio, with yet another fascinating, deep and enjoyable book. The sweep from mathematics to group theory and symmetry to history and art is simply mindboggling. This book is so well researched that it ends up solving a longstanding mystery: Livio identifies who probably killed Evariste Galois, the brilliant young mathematician who laid out the proofs that became the foundation for the entire science of group theory the night before he died in a dawn pistol duel at the age of 20. Evariste's death has been a mystery for nearly 200 years. The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved ironically solves that mystery.Besides identifying a killer, this book is the first science book for the layman that attempts to tackle group theory and its related fields. It may well be the last. It will be very hard to top."
2,Uneven Handling of Symmetry from Mathematical and Aesthetic Perspectives,"This is a hack job by someone who is clearly interested in the subject matter, but handles it very unevenly. The book begins with the question of why symmetry is significant from an aesthetic perspective, but then gives a mathematical explanation of symmetry (primarily the contributions of group theory), mixed with some choppy, historically dubious biographies of the involved mathematicians that go far off track, and then makes a poor attempt to tie the book together in the end."
1,The Equation that couldn't be solved,"I have not read more boring and rambling book. Its approach to symmetry is garbled - author wants to write more and more, so does not spend sufficient time elaborating what he wants to say. The group theory coverage is lacking. Galoi and his theory have been given short shrift. There are no examples to show how Galoi's theory is applied to quintic and other equation. Many times I felt lost while I was reading the book - was it symmetry, group theory or Galoi's theory or something else like mating. The book does not hold your interest. I donot personally recommend this nook to anybody"
3,More of a biography,"I bought this book thinking that it was going to discuss symmetry in mathematics, but it barely touched on it in any depth. It was mostly a biography of Abel and Galois; which was intriguing. On the whole, the book was worth reading, but it was not what I was expecting. They really should change the title of the book. If you are looking for any earnest discussion of symmetry, look else where."
3,"Too much history, too little math",The book is okay for what it tries to do but I was expecting something different. There is too much history about the people involved in trying to solve the quintic equation and not enough actual math. The parts about how group theory is used in field like particle physics is very thin.I think Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe by Leon Lederman is of course more detailed in the physics area but even the descriptions of bilateral and other symmetries is much better.
3,"MAX Comfort? Yes, MAX Durability? Uh No...","Product is used on a walker's handles, not those of a bicycle. The handle grips are staying put alright, but the narrow strip of darker material is coming away from where it has been (cheaply) glued to the lighter gray material, and is now dangling.Also, the grips are constantly slipping around on the handle, despite the handle being the correct diameter for their use. That is not particularly useful.The force exerted on the grips in my application is far less than would be exerted supporting a rider's upper torso on a moving bike.You guys can do that math...."
5,A good buy,This set is high quality and held up very well. I would recommend it to anyone who does fine work.
3,OK for soft materials,"The drill bits worked fine on soft materials such as seashells as long as I didn't put too much pressure on the bit. But on harder materials such as ceramic or stone, the diamond coating wore off very quickly, rendering the bit useless. And yes, I did use lubricant."
4,Nice for the price...,"Pretty good value, be sure and wet them when in use to extend their life. Arrived promply and overall a good value."
2,What do you want for 15 cents?,"Yes, they are diamond point bits. No, they are not industrial quality. If you plan on heavy use, look elsewhere and pay the price.However, all I'm doing is drilling holes in some seashells and these bits work. Depending upon the thickness of the shell, I can drill between 6-12 holes before the bit is trashed. Given the price, I can't say I'm surprised by the lack of quality.The only downside is that they all fell out of the slots during shipping. I can live with that for 15 cents a bit."
1,Maybe good for plastic.,The first one I used went dull in about 20 seconds. It barely left a mark on the glass I was working with. The next one I used was on soft metal. Very unimpressive. You get what you pay for. Buy Ryobi drills if you want to grind through glass.
1,Poor quality,"I had used similar bits, but these were of such poor quality that the diamond coating came off almost immediately. After the third bit failed, I gave up."
1,Sorry doesn't even scratch surface of stone,I am surely disappointed as i had similar set from another vendor that was perfect for stone with dremel but these are useless.
3,My Dad always told me,"""You get what you pay for!"" and as usual - Dad is right! :)Yes, there ARE 20 bits. I believe the ""180 grit"" refers to the number of diamond particles distributed amongst all 20 pieces! LOL! The thinner-tipped ones are not straight. BUT, I think they'll serve my purpose, which is to smooth off the edges of my glass crafting pieces. And at this price, I didn't expect something of high quality so I'm not really disappointed. But ""Pro-Quality"" is certainly a misnomer.On the GOOD side, they arrived pretty promptly."
3,semi amazed,"although the bits performed as good as i need them to, the green foam-stuff arrived slightly torn away, so it doesn't support the tools properly."
4,Perfect for Small Hobby or Craft Jobs,This was purchased as a Christmas Present to go with the Dremmel Drill and Drill Stand. There is a bit for every use you may need.
4,rotary tool,This was a gift for a 16 year old who does wood carving. He hasn't used it yet so don't know how he likes it.
3,hollow?,Are these hollow? Why does it say different shaped tips? Dont they just drill hole of different sizes? Description is lacking
2,"2 of Pro-Quality 20-Piece Diamond-Point Bit Set for Rotary Tool - Glass, Stone, Ceramic","2 of Pro-Quality 20-Piece Diamond-Point Bit Set for Rotary Tool - Glass, Stone, Ceramic 2 of Pro-Quality 20-Piece Diamond-Point Bit Set for Rotary Tool - Glass, Stone, Ceramic 2 of Pro-Quality 20-Piece Diamond-Point Bit Set for Rotary Tool - Glass, Stone, Ceramic You get a D- Because It says ""2 of Pro-Quality 20-Piece"" and I was forced to pay for 2 sets AND ONE did not have all 20 Pieces!!!!!"
2,Not as described,I ordered these bits because the listing said they were 180 grit. The package only says 120-150 grit. I'd recommend getting the 30 piece set for $1 or $2 more.
1,Not worth it,"I tried to drill sea glass, the 1st 2 bits ""melted"" and mushroomed. The next 4 attempts broke the pieces and didn't even drill 1/16"" deep."
1,They burn your glass,"As soon as you start engraving with them they burn the glass and dark color,even when used with water, was so disappointing."
4,Went through the hardest manmade material in the world!,"I broke an ez-out off in a broken exhaust manifold to head bolt that was stuck in my cylinder head. All the hardware stores around wanted $10 for ONE BIT! Now I will say it took quite a bit of time but with only a couple of the bits in this kit I went through a good 0.5-0.75 inches worth of hardened carbon steel, and they worked great with just a simple electric rotary dremel tool. As long as you know what you're doing, and you take your time, and don't force anything these bits should be able to go through just about anything!"
1,Bits will not drill porcelain effectively,I used these in a drill press to try and trill some holes in a porcelain tile. They were almost completely useless. I ended up getting some diamond hole saws I purchased here as well and used them instead even though the hole was larger than I needed they drilled hundreds of times faster. These bits simply did not work.
4,Truely awesome metal,"This is one awesome album, hard to believe it has taken me over 25 years to have bought it. If not for that movie, THE STORY OF ANVIL, I would have never even heard of this band, now I can not get enough of them."
3,anvil,I bought this for my 11 year old son who is going to be a rock god in the future . He says it is amazing and he loves it alot. So that is my review
5,Staying Together -Movie,This movie is Beautiful and meaningful !!! Filled with eye candy & laughter and Love. The small town pics are really Great also. Very good movie and will watch again & share with friends that aren't conservative with closed minds.
2,Coming apart,"Another movie that ended up being a lot more lame than what the reviews led me to believe. I'm glad others were so moved, but this film was pretty much pure cheesiness. The relationships between the three brothers, for that matter the whole family, was pretty superficial and unconvincing. It was nice to see the actors in their younger years, but for me there just wasn't much more to appreciate about this film."
2,"Didn't think this was ""R"" rated or would not have ordered","Don't like ""R"" rated movies, think they can be done without the smut and I intend to throw it away, not the fault of the sellers, just didn't see the rating."
5,Feng Shui Hobbyist,This is one of my favorite feng shui book. The graphic are execellent and easy to understand and very practical.
1,Not the best book,One of the several Feng Shui books I bought. Just clean up your home and arrange it as you like. I don't like all this condemnation. If you don't do this or that bad things will happen to you. I think it's a load of nonsense and something to make money off of. The constant threatening of Feng Shui to begin with seems evil to me. Keep away from it.
2,Zircon Repeater Tape Measure,"I used this tape for about two weeks before it jammed. The tape jammed in the case and wouldn't return.I played with the tape and it went back in and lasted about another three days.The idea is good but the quality of the product is to cheap for construction purposes.The tape is very thin so it's break point is very short,3'max.The quality of the recorder is pretty weak too.It is garbled at best.It is understandable but you have to listen closely.The overall rating would have to be poor in my estimation.I had the 25' tape not the 10'.I have had better luck with Zircon's stud finders."
2,Not Very Good,"Very Flimsy. Feels like a toy. Very hard to understand, and I end up writing evrything down anyway..."
4,Social commentary tucked into a great story.,"I first read this book 20 years ago at the urging of my aunt, and have since lost track of my copy. The recent headline about an accident involving a van load of migrant farm workers brought the book vividly to mind--this echoes the opening scene of the story, which goes on to detail how a New York businessman, on a trip south to dispose of a dead relative's newspaper, becomes involved in the local problems, finds his liberal ideology put to the test, and finds new friends and new love. It's one of those long and wonderful reads that book lovers die for! Would make a great movie, better than ""Milagro Beanfield War"", but similar themes."
4,Good presentation,This is a good presentation of the basic teachings of the Catholic Church. Interesting style of explanations as if you were actually sitting down and talking to a non-Catholic or non-Christian about the basic truths of the faith.
2,folks who work for Sally E shouldn't write reviews,Several people who work for Sally Edwards wrote glowing reviews of theis book. I think their are some ethical issues in reviewing a book written by your employer or business partner.Check HEARTZONE.COM for the people who work for Sally.
3,"Motivating, but not a training guide","As a recreational Mountain Biker, i found this book motivating. However, it's not a ""training guide"" for cyclists. Everyone that has never trained should consider buying this book, since it explains the principles involved in heart zone training. You will also find very interesting indoor workouts in the book. It's not the book for the intermediate cyclist."
4,Touching!,"Cally, I absolutely loved this book. For a first time author I think you did an amazing job. I enjoyed reading it page to page. And I appreciated it as well.It was a touching story and I look forward to reading your other stories!"
4,Good Messure in Tight Spots,"I own one of these tape messures and it has really come in handy in places where you would normally have to crane your neck or do a balancing act to read the tape. The memory feature has saved me from cutting stock too short on several occasions. While it may not be the most absolutely accurate one for fine woodworking, it does the job for framing and craft work. It's a good addition to the workshop tool chest."
1,Deffective product; no vendor service.,"I bought the tool for its digital functions. It arrived without a battery; the digital features did not work. With much difficulty I discovered how to open the battery compartment and determined the type of battery required. I asked the seller about these issues but he was of no help. I purchased and installed the specified battery. The unit still did not work at all. I returned the tool to the seller at my expense and suffered the cost of the battery. I am extremely disapointed with this purchase, and will not repaet a purchase from this supplier."
1,not very useful,the digital tape does not seem very useful to me. I have one and it does not work very well.
3,Too Small,"Corelle plates and bowls have been with our household ever since I remember.Our favorite of the Corelles is the divided dish. They stack on top of each other perfectly. Unfortunately, not this 8-1/2 inch but the 10 inch plate. The 10 inch plate saves us at least one plate to wash. The 8-1/2 inch is too small specially to be divided into 3 parts.Pros:-Durable. Me and my wife have dropped them many times; and they don't break easily.-Light. Less stress for our kitchen shelves.-Microwave safe-Easy to clean-Dishwasher safeCons:- Too small"
5,Terrific Divided Dish,More than meets my expectations. Like the somewhat smaller size in order to serve smaller portions.Washes easily. Surpasses plastic from past years. Very pleased.
4,bought it and never used it,"Such a great idea, and it looks like the government's new www.myplate.gov. However, I never use this plate! I stick with the regular plates and try to practice portion sizes. It's because I no longer eat individual items like broccoli or meat. I eat meat and vegetables but in more complicated dishes like casseroles."
3,Best source available,"This book provides a thorough history of Corfu from ancient world until the 19th century.Due to its date of publication in 1852, however, it is not written in a way we nowadays would expect a history book to be.I would call the author's outlook on the indigenous population somewhat imperialistic. (Corfu was then ruled by the British.)He assumes that the reader has a great background knowledge of European and especially Mediterranean history; besides his style is rather long-winded.Nevertheless there seem to be no alternatives on this topic in English language and so I can recommend this book as best source available."
2,SILLY,"Don't be fooled by the great package or cover art. This band was so silly, so stupid, you cannot believe it. Their lyrics, their stage act, their leader (Lips), everything was ludicrous and exxagerated. No wonder they went nowhere."
2,MASTERPIECE ????!!! WHAT A JOKE?,"ANVIL was always s silly band, the kind of band that is responsible for giving heavy metal such a bad reputation. Their music is souless, noisy, ridiculous. IT has some energy, but asotutely no memorable moment. (and htis is their best album!! Imagine the others!!)"
5,That Moron on Pennsylvania Avenue,"This is one of the funniest books I have read! Maybe now those who support Bush will realize they are supporting the worst president ever. The election is this year, and four years of this jerk has been enough. It's time for change, and this man will destroy society to give the rich moreand the poor less."
2,No Replacement Parts support,I bought this and it worked fine for awhile but the ear hook it swivels but not where it connects to the device broke and then it won't stay on the ear. I called the service support and they said TWICE that they would send out an replacement part to me free I Never got it. Now I find out that not only they can't send that part but I can't buy it from their accessories department. So unless you can find a universal replacement part your headset is now unusable as it won't stay on your ear.
5,So Nice For A Day of Doing Nothing,"This is a great CD to listen to while practicing the lost art of doing absolutely nothing. Just imagine yourself lying on a hammock with your eyes closed and a gentle breeze blowing over your skin. You're not asleep...you are awake...but you've decided that this is the day you're just going to be a human being rather than a human doing.Even if you do decide to do something, like maybe switching posistions in the hammock or pouring yourself a glass of lime-ade, this is the music to listen to. Its slow but easy paced rythyms will move you into a place where you know and feel that life really is too short to be frantic and high strung.I love this CD. It's great music to just ""be"" with...like a lover or a friend or maybe a friend who is a lover. I hope you buy this CD as well as a hammock built for two.Enjoy this life, friends, enjoy!"
3,Mellow multiplied,"An elegant disc to spin while sipping drinks at the pool, but overexposure to this excess of chill does tend to lead to earburn."
5,Everything promised and more,"This product is so good, it made me a better woodworker! Just after I received it, I had a situation where I had to build an octagonal structure quickly. It also had to mate with another object, that was pre-existing. I am a fair woodworker, at best, but with the assistance of this product, I was able to create a very large octagon with virtually no slop in the corners very quickly. I also had to cut a large number of pieces of plastic to random but exact sizes for a related project, and that went smoothly as well. It was useful and reliable beyond my fondest hopes. A must have for anal-retentive perfectionists!"
5,Great measuring tool,"Guitar makers listen up: I build guitars, and this is the perfect size for our craft, for centerlines,edge-marking,and general use. Highly accurate and well-crafted."
2,Glamorous Advertisment,"Unless you are new or just need an introduction to Feng Shui, save your time and money. This will not teach you the art of Feng shui placement or give you ""cures"" for your home. It's focus is on why you should hire an expert such as herself to show you how to bring harmony to your home. A wonderfull salesperson, I'll give her that! The only reason for the 2 stars are for the presentation of her program."
4,A good general guide,"I appreciate the perspectives that the autor shares about aspects of parenting I may not have considered, particularly in the beginning when addressing several guidelines to keep in mind about all parenting challenges. If you're looking for a comprehensive guide to some particular problem, such as discipline, this probably isn't the book you want. However, if it's sitting on your bookshelf and you're in the middle of dealing with some issue, you can look to it as a resource that will point you in a good direction and to help you learn more."
3,The Parenting Survival Kit : How to Make It Through the Pare,"I saw this author on Oprah and thought she had some good ideas, so I rushed out to get her book. But the book was just a basic guide with not anything that you probably haven't tried before with your kids. What I did find useful was in the back of the book she has a resource guide dealing with specific items in the book that you may want to get further information about. Examples include: about four pages of webpage addresses for parenting issues as well as her recommended books, broken down by specific parenting issue."
4,Not bad,"Product seems to be sturdy. The color doesnt exactly match the 360. Base mounts on fine, USB pass through plug and play. Fan is a bit louder than OEM though the fan is a little on the weak side. The product appears to work fine so far."
5,Deserves 10 stars,"I happened upon a review and ordered the book. When it arrived, I read it with a lump in my throat and my eyes tearing up. My 72 year old mother and I were driving to another town when I started telling her about it. I couldn't get that damn lump out of my throat and pretty soon my voice started quivering and I started crying. She just reached over and held my hand as I got my composure back. I was done, though, I told her she had to read it. She did. Afterward, she took it to one of her clubs and shared it. It's just a 10 minute read, but it sure provides plenty of emotion. I am so glad I happened upon it. A glorious story. Thank you."
4,Divine Fire,"goes in circles, but I really liked how it turns, I enjoyed this book alot, have read other books by Ms Jackson, and enjoyed them too"
1,divine fire......,"or, ""How To Make Lord Byron boring"". What started out interesting in the prologue quickly turned BORING when the heroine is introduced.What I find is becoming a constant problem in modern paranormal romance is the author fleshs out these complex alpha male heroes to only shackle them with the ""super intelligent heroine who turns ditzy as soon as she meets the hero"".For example-in this book-the heroine writes a 1800+ page mega book on Byron but can't get to a meeting on time and arrives at meeting with her ""pink and purple houndstooth suitcase"" in hand? UGH! Paranormal writers PLEASE note: readers want strong, capable heroines!I couldn't even finish this one-not recommended.1 star."
2,unadbashedly shameful,"I normally find M. Jackson's books mostly original, cute and fun. Forget references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and look a little closer to now. I am sitting here wondering why she decided to take the Lord Byron as vampire character of Tom Holland's 1995 Lord of the Dead and 1997 Slave of My Thirst and turn those 768 pages of Byronic angst into a 339 page romance novel. Holland does Byron the vampire much better. I recommend the Holland books to those who read more than romance novels."
1,Divine Fire - Melanie Jackson,I did not enjoy this particular novel. I felt it was slow and uneventful. The plot was too long and drawn out for me. There wasn't enough action or plot. Melanine Jackson can do so much better.
4,Not Your Average Romance!,"I picked this novel up as I thought the cover amazing. I am reader of romance for 20 years and love all types. I always love the boy-meets-girl and happily every after stories and expected the same here. However, Ms. Jackson blew my mind with her take on a well-known historical figure.I wished for more chemsitry and the relationship development seemed a little unlikley.Worth picking up!"
2,eratic and mannered,"This is my first encounter with Dejan Lazic's piano playing. It will be my last. His playing of Ravel is, quite simply, absurd. It is so ridiculously erratic and mannered, one can barely make out Ravel's glorious creation. His complete disregard for tempo and the printed score makes this disc impossible to be taken seriously and should be dismissed as irrelevant. How someone of this level of incompetence lands a recording contract is beyond me when are there so many legitimate artists so deserving of the honor of being recorded. Make no mistake: Lazic is to piano playing as Bocelli is to opera singing. Lazic is a wanna be who should never have been. Channel Classics should be ashamed."
3,Not what i expected,"I bought these picks thinking they'd just be, well picks. Even thought the pick is a little part of the whole guitar experience, it's still important. The edges are rough and the tip chips. I do not reccomend it."
3,Caveat: I am only a beginner,I found that the lack of grip on these makes it very slippery when my hands begin sweating. The finish on them is not great either. The have sharp edges which need to be sanded down. Just about the only positive things I can about these are that they seem durable and look cool!
3,Not what I would grab to play with,"I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different ""gel"" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well."
3,Small but cute,"The bracelet was nice and worth the price. However, it is a bit small. Luckily, the friend who I purchased it for is quite petite. Had I bought it for myself I would have had to return it. I'm 5'8 and weigh 135 lbs so if you are my size you may consider not buying."
4,A Lesson on Cultural Diversity,"This review is a collaborative writing project completed by a section of ""Cultural Diversity"" students at the University of Phoenix in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado. It focuses on the best-known of the album's songs, ""Short People.""We find ""Short People"" to have a catchy tune--as one class member puts it, ""happy-snappy, but tacky."" Another student exclaims, ""It would be a wonderful theme song to a sit-com.""We believe that our instructor introduced us to this song because ""it has to do with cultural diversity in the genetic department,"" which is right next to garden supplies, in Aisle 3A. If one listens closely to the words, he or she may discover that ""Short People"" advocates tolerance and acceptance.""Overall assessment: six thumbs up!"
4,We see Greenspan as unique and learn some history,"This is a good read. It paints a vivid picture of a very unique individual, from childhood on. The author presents the facts in a reasonably captivating way without drawing conclusions for us. He also gives us a nice review of U.S. economic history without putting us to sleep. A task not easily done."
4,Portrait of a unique guy,"Did you know that Greenspan's first occupation was as a musician or that he spent many years as part of the Ayn Rand collective? Greenspan is a bit of a Renaissance man in his own right. This book is fine introduction toward understanding the historical, economic, and philosophical contexts that have shaped the man that now quasi-guides the direction of our economy."
4,Understanding The Enigma,"I found this book to be very well written, introduces you to one of the most powerful man in the world in a lucid and friendly manner. Read this book if you want a better understanding of the man behind the levers of the economy, but if you want a better understanding of the economy itself or how the FED works, you may need additional reading. I enjoyed the book thoroughly."
3,No!,"I was very disappointed with this album. VOD's previous releases were great, but in this album, they lost the energy and hard-rockin' ability that made them great and unique. The only song I really enjoyed was the 1st track, Living to Die. That was an awesome track, but I became bored with the other songs. However, I am starting to enjoy the album a bit more now. I guess it takes several listens. But overall, I am still a bit disappointed."
2,Horrid,"This is the worst softening of a great band since Metallica. VOD went from the brutally brilliant ""Imprint"" album to this Godsmack wanna-be garbage. Completely disappointing. Anyone of the current crop of ""nu-metal"" bands could have made this peice of excrement."
1,terrible,"This cd is terrible, so don't waste your money. There is hardly any trace of their hardcore roots, and tim's vocals are weak. Apparently vod has gone commercial like so many others. Buy Imprint or For the Bleeders instead. Because those albums were so great, I am willing to look the other way at From Bliss to Devastation."
5,Absolutely the best hardcore album i own,"This album is awesome....every song sounds so sick its crazy...i don't know wtf other ppl are talking about his vocals are weak or that they abandoned their original sound 'cause this album is dope! Man, i hear all the stuff out their and just recently got into the rest of this album and i'm just sad i didn't get a chance to see them. Everybody keep their eyes on tim's new band Fix8!"
2,What Happened???,"Wow is all I can say. What happened to VOD? I owned their 1st album and loved it for the raw energy and positive lyrics hidden behind the pummeling guitars. I picked up their latest and must say I am quite saddened to find that VOD has turned into a wannabe chimaira/switched/Damage Plan. Is it still hard? Yes. Is it straight ahead hardcore? No. The first 5-6 songs plod along with no real originallity and nothing to differentiate one between the other. The 2nd hald of the album picks up a little, but not much.What happened to these guy? They were a hardcore band and now they have tried to turn into some kind of metal band and they sound the same as about 8 other bands out in the market today. If this is their attempt to appeal to a larger fan base then i expect they won't have a record deal in 2-3 years"
3,I only need one,"After a mastectomy I needed something less than a full prosthesis and a clunky bra. I wear a regular bra and add the enhancer to the ""missing"" side. The first enhancer I used was rather expensive but I could alternate the 2 pieces for longer wear. This style has left and right sides and a slight nipple effect, so you can't switch them and wear them on the ""wrong"" side. As a result I can only use one of the pair, so it's good to get them on sale. The edges are a bit rough. They are also seriously pink in color rather than nude. This would probably be a good choice for someone who occasionally wants to fill out a certain dress or create some cleavage (they do that just fine) but for every day wear I'd go for the more expensive department store brand."
2,Be Sure of What You're Getting Here,"We need to warn people here. The binder will hold 128, but they don't supply the means for you to do it. They start you off with 5 pages, you'll have to buy the rest. Thanks."
2,Unexpected dissapointment!,I did not realize that this book is a Bible study. The author writes in an immature style that sounds more like a high school student writer than a grown woman with a degree from seminary. I was bored and had to force myself through it. the questions at the end of each chapter were infantile and simplistic. the only people I would recommend this book to would be youth who were wanting to learn and understand about death. This might be a good book for a youth group to take on as a reading group discussion book.
3,Great Idea!,"I tried this one, it works and the concept is great. A lot of leaves and debris get in it.I found a better design in Amazon.com auctions under home and garden, called the rain barrel. This is an impressive design, it has a screen on top and spicot on the bottom for hose hook-up. Nothing else required! In Colorado with the water restiction so tight, I managed to keep my garden alive with the little rain that we had and adding the gray water to it. Check it out!"
1,The Veneer of Actual Information,"This book is 80% verbage and 20% needed information. The ratio is similar to that you might get from listening to bloated bureacrat explain federal regulations for the purchase of government pencils.The worst part about this book is that upon first reading, it actually seems to contain information. You don't realize how much verbage there is until it comes time to take a nursing test.Don't listen to these other reviewers. Avoid this book at all costs. I've spent hours poring over a single chapter only to find a shorter more compact book that got the info across in ten minutes."
5,Had to have this for class,This version is my Med-Surg instructor's favorite Med-Surg book ever. She pulls many of her test questions from this version. It was well worth my effort to go online and purchase a used copy of it.This book is well written and includes a lot of stuff my instructor assures us could help us around HESI and NCLEX time over the other Med-Surg books we have seen.Although this was not a required list book for my course I am still very glad I chose to order it.
2,OK-but full of mistakes,The book is ok. Not the greatest. Our class found a lot of mistakes in this text and the publisher even sent one of us a new edition because of this. We actually recommended they ditch this books so next years students do not have to go through this txt
1,The worst textbook I have ever had!!,"I don't like this book because this book doesn't provide a clear and to the point explanation. The content is unexciting, boring, and sometimes contradict each other. The text is inadequately written with a lot of errors which caused confusing and headache. I hate this book !!!"
5,Nursing class,I needed this book for a nursing class that I am taking. It is the very book that I needed since they were sold out at the college bookstore. What else can I say? I received the book within the time limit as requested. Your service was above par.
5,good grades cost a bit more,use this to insure your grades are good. many lazy teachers use questions from here for the test.
3,Great for building strong arms!,"Lifting this book was about the only thing this book was good for. For actually taking a test I scored MUCH higher when I used the Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN. Saunders told me what I needed to know for my test, and that is really all I have time for."
5,Very bright and can be clipped to belt or attached to seat post,This very bright light offers multiple blinking patterns including the option to stay constantly on. It's lightweight and can be attached to a belt/waist line or on a seat post. Battery life with the 2 AAA's (not included) is yet to be determined. Excellent value!
3,"Bright, but fragile.","The mount sheared from normal commuting duty after a couple of weeks, and the battery compartment is prone to separation (just use some tape to keep it together.)The light is extremely bright, and really gets drivers attention."
4,a good blinkie,"I took the advice of previous posters and from the beginning I wrapped some duck take around the seam to make sure it wont pop off, but so far it works well.I commute a lot on rough roads and in the rain and it does what it's supposed to do. I actually leave it on ""on"" (not blink) and have another one I put on blink; have not had to change batteries yet.Only gave it 4 stars because it's a cheap model and does not compare to the high end blinkies."
2,"Works great, until it falls off and breaks","I had the same problem as Jane Healy referred to in her review - the faceplate falls off far too easily. My friend and I each installed these on our bikes, and by five minutes into the ride neither of us had a functioning rear light any longer. We weren't riding on any extremely bumpy trails, just a regular road.If you know about this problem beforehand and take care to tape the light up, it probably won't be a problem. Still, these things should have been built a lot more sturdily.Aside from this, the light is visible for a very long distance and has several blink modes. If not for the sturdiness issue I'd give it five stars."
3,"Okay, but","This is a decently bright light, but not near the best. I would spend twice as much and get a better light that is more visible in daylight, especially if you are putting this on your kid's bike.However, for the price, this is a decent buy, and definitely better than no light at all."
3,Not for Runners,"This product comes with a hookup for a bicycle. The light has a built-in clip that allows you to attach the light to the bike hookup and easily remove the light from the bike hookup without having to remove the hookup. Great product for visibility on a bicycle. But I would not recommend this product for runners because the light is too bulky and heavy (takes 3 AAA batteries) to wear on clothing while running. Also, the clip is not adjustable so it is not meant to stay on clothing.Works great for bikes. However, if you are a runner looking for a safety light, i would not recommend this product."
2,Not very practical,I purchased this as a gift for a relative who had just moved to Boise. She advised that this map was not very useful as the size of the maps was so small.I assumed this would be a fold-out map but apparently it is in booklet form.
5,Way Cool,"I too bought these for boating, and find the image stabalized compass really helpful. Without the stabilization, the compass would swing around 15 degrees either side, with it, maybe 1-3 degrees. I expecially enjoy the fact that I can adjust for my vision once, and not touch the focus -- ever... I can also read the compass with my glasses on -- and that is unusual for some units I tried.Yes, get the flotation strap.. Dolts will drop them..."
5,This piece is a jewel.,"I bought the binoculars 4 years ago and used them mainly for boating.I only can reconfirm the previous review. The optics are superb, giving a good view in low light conditions and even at night. I had no need to change the battery for the compass light in these four years, but used the compass illumination may be no more than 20 times. Buying these binoculars seems expensiv, but it is like aquiring a jewel. With a little of care you will not need to buy other binoculars for the rest of your live."
3,Coronation of King George VI with illustations,The story of two eager children as they prepare for the Coronation of King George in 1937. Lots of charming pictures in color and black and white.
3,itty bitty chicky chucker,The chickens are super tiny. Not for small children. I could see this going very wrong.I got it for my mom as a joke so that she could take it to the office. I don't think she ever actually used it.The chickens are so small that if you were to use it in a large space (office) then you're 100% likely to lose them.
4,More fun for adults!,This was a big hit with a few friends over the course of a weekend. I just hope that you can replace the chickens without having to buy another chucker.....haven't checked yet. It's fun!
3,Great looks with zero arch support,"These shoes are very retro and look great with a pair of dark jeans and a blazer for a sort of slightly dressy casual look. However, the arch support inside the shoe is so flat they're a bit uncomfortable to wear for very long. Definitely a shoe for the flat footed."
3,not what i expected,"there was a mark on the tip of my shoe-a brownisah red, i was sent the wrong size( gave me big ones). One thing that was nice..... was the fast, speedy refunding of my money.Overall I will maybe do business again, just depends if there is a discount or special or something."
4,hard to keep together,this ice fortress ice is extremly hard to keep together. it took for ever to get it together. the fire breathing feature is a little hard to put together according to the instructions. the wings break easily if you put pressur on them.
3,do not buy this set,this set is worthless the cold flame technology didnt work and then it broke!When i tried to move it into another room it totally fell apart.I do not recommend this set.Its just a wastew of money.i shouldnt have bought.
3,Provides some Good Contributions to OO Design,"This book is considered a classic by many. The key contribution of the book is the introduction of Use Cases for requirements capture. Jacobson also provides some good hints on how to develop an OO design after starting from Use Cases.There are two big weaknesses with this book. Firstly, the book is vague on the amount of detail that should go into a Use Case. This has led to a great amount of confusion and widely different usages in industry. Secondly, the book provides only weak design guidelines beyond those provided for extracting objects from the Use Cases.Another criticism of the book is that it is written in a very academic tone, which may be hard to understand for some readers.Another book that covers much of the same ground but in a clearer fashion is Ian Graham's _Migrating to Object Technology_."
3,Important work but somewhat confusing and now outdated ...,"Although this book is seminal in as much as it presents use-cases, it is definitely not the clearest introduction to OO. It does however present Jacobson's OOSE methodology (which is a simplified version of the Objectory methodology). The book is due for an update - and I believe one has been in the pipeline for a while. However, with the release of UML and the new Rational methodology, it is perhaps best left as is."
1,Attempts to Describe Content Free OOSE,"An OO methodology book without an OO method. OOSE hides and/or conceals the most important aspects of use cases, for resale in the author's product. Frustratingly useless."
2,Not one of her best.,"Iris Johansen is one of my favorite authors, so much so that I customarily buy her books in hard back. In previous books Sean's character was intriguing, so I found myself looking forward to his story with great anticipation. When I finished the novel I didn't have any better insight into his character than before I began to read it. The entire novel fell flat from beginning to end. There was no tension between the characters, no excitement, no intrigue. In short, the mediocre character and plot development resulted in a shallow, disappointing book. I don't like to end a review on a negative note, so I will state Ms. Johansen is a wonderful writer, and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of her previous mysteries."
2,Sean Galen Deserved So Much Better!,"I am a big fan of the Eve Duncan series, and through that series was introduced to Sean Galen. I almost skipped this book (wish I had), but I thought the character of Sean Galen was so great that I didn't want to miss his book. I felt the character was done a complete disservice with this book. I felt none of the spunk or witty behavior that he exuded with Eve. I lost the sexy vibe which made his character so interesting. Pairing him with a hard woman like Elena seemed bitter to me, and I wanted his life to be sweet. Not sappy, but to feel good going down. This story was tough to swallow, especially the suspension of disbelief I would have needed to believe he could actually fall for this gal. Ah well - every Eve Duncan series male cannot make as good a match as Logan and his Sarah; but for Sean I wanted better."
5,Elena is One Tough Woman,"Elena Kyler will protect her son and keep him away from the man who raped her at all costs. Rico Chavez will kill anyone who stands in the way of getting his son back from the woman he raped, and more than that, he wants the woman, Elena, dead as well. Sean Galen (from the past couple IJ books) has sworn to protect her. He's super tough and Elena's tough too, but Rico is closing in, killing everyone that gets in his way. Five stars for this thriller from Iris Johansen, she gets better with every book she writes."
2,"Read one, you read them all","If you already read And Then you Die and Ugly Duckling, this is pretty much the same story line with different names to the character and slightly different plots...the bottom line is the same, someone really evil is chasing someone with issues but basically a good person, that good person Elena, is being help by another person who has issues but has a big heart, Galen. Gales has another friend who is helping without wanting to look like he is helping named Judd. The twist at the end about Judd was fun..."
5,WOW,what a great book this is of course a page turner from the first page till the end this was a very exciting book one of the greatest iris johansen books i have read i would have to say.
2,Johansen Has Written Much Better,"A long-time fan of this author, I've read all of the prior novels in this grouping of characters and was intrigued with Sean's story. To be blunt, I was disappointed in this book. Elena had interesting potential that never went anywhere, Barry was sticky-sweet, Sean was completely flat, and the plot jumped to ludicrous and then completely predictable at the end. I do think that some of the supporting characters - Dominic and Luis, namely - were great. For a reader who LOVED the Eve Duncan series, I have to say that I'm sorry I paid full price for this book."
4,Finally- Sean's story,"Sean Galen has been a secondary character in several of Iris Johansen's book and he finally gets his own story. No one to Trust is the story of rebel Elena- who is trying to protect her son from his rapist father, a columbian drug lord (Chavez)Helping Elena is Sean Galen, but their efforts to keep her son safe are thwarted by Chavez's determination to get his son by any means. He sends hitman to kill those protecting her and offers staggering amounts of money to bribe anyone--the identity of the final betrayer certainly comes as a shock. Amid the battle, the romance between Elena and Galen is believable, but the secondary characters of Dominic, Jared etc added to the book's readability. It was also nice to mention her past characters- logan.This book was a combination of adventure, romance, suspence and is a great book to read! Can't wait for her next!"
5,Excellent,first book i read from this author and i loved it. it's filled with action and it does not slow down. highly recommend this book.
2,OKAY READ,"I agree with Laura Dawson's review, been there, done that, why are we doing it again? I kept asking myself haven't you already read this? I couldn't come up with a title, but boy it sure seemed familar. This was an okay book, not great, just okay. I expected better from Iris."
3,A Bit Sluttish,"Elena Kyler tries to get herself and her five-year-old son out of Colombia safely, and into the US. Again, I still don't understand what John Logan and Sean Galen do for a living. And why does the author always get her female characters to have sex with men they know just about nothing about? Just seems a bit sluttish. (C+)"
4,more more!,"i'm so glad ms. johansen decided to write more about sean galen! yippee! i liked elena, but there was something missing, she was won over too quickly. the plot was great and the book enjoyable."
3,ALBUM FOR DEDICATED FANS,"Not considered one of Van's classics, Period Of Transition does have its charms. You Gotta Make It Through The World is a mid-tempo ballad with prominent sax and It Fills You Up also has nice sax and piano flourishes with R&B style backing vocals. A heavenly soprano choir opens The Eternal Kansas City before Van takes up the line ""excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City"" for a mellow, laid back groove. The pace picks up for Joyous Sound, a bouncy gospel number, while the rhythmic Flamingos Fly romps on nicely and is my favorite here for its catchy hook. Transition is far from being Morrison's best album and is quite average by his high standards of song-craft, but it is nevertheless enjoyable overall with some outstanding moments. I recommend it to Morrison completists rather than the novice intent on investigating the work of this poetic genius."
3,Devoted fans only,"Not considered one of Van's classics, Period Of Transition does have its charms.

A heavenly soprano choir opens The Eternal Kansas City before Van takes up the line ""excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City"" for a mellow, laid back groove.

I recommend it to Morrison completists rather than the novice intent on investigating the work of this poetic genius."
2,Really For Completists,"But this ONLY if you already have most of his other albums! Even by Van The Man's high standards, this one falls a bit low. Not as far as being bad, but this album is not an essential part of his vast body of work. For completists only!"
2,Average collaboration with well known brass section...,"1977,a year when Elvis died,all rockin' world was in deep sorrow although it was expectible,in Manchester was born the first baby (Louise Brown) ""in vitro"" technique,S.P Jobs and Wozniak made the first personal computer my parents planed another child(me)...but Van recorded a Period of transition,cd which is not bad but not special by anything. I mean that was the time when Van was in real transition from Polydor to Excile divison,this cd is nothing more but a cool collaboration Van with Dr. John, what is maybe the only reason why you should hear this thing,if you can listen to it at your friend's player- that would be great, if you cannot than buy it on sale."
4,Pretty good,"This is definitely a cd that should not be overlooked if you're a Van Morrison fan or a fan of some bluesy, funky, soul filled songs. This definitely was a transition period for Van, but the cd is still a very enjoyable listen. All the songs catch a great groove and Van's singing is great. Perhaps it should not be your first Van Morrison purchase, but it is definitely worth owning."
3,"Ride on, Belfast Cowboy","Fellow Van fans think me perverse for liking Period of Transition. Snobs! I know it's not Van's best. This is ""cheeseburger"" to his ""filet mignon"" . ""Eternal Kansas City"" is downright embarassing. But Dr. John is a fine ""soul-mate"" for Van. Short, punchy little numbers spiced with funk, R&B, and gospel. Plus, Van sounds like he's into it, not phoning it in as in recent years. Hmm, wonder what would have happened had Van hooked up with the Meters? Life's too short for only Astral Weeks. Lighten up and give this a try."
2,cheap and the wings fall off,the wings r velcrowed on so everytime you walk past somethign and the wings touch it they fall off and the material looks cheap not hot
2,Interesting Topic but writing gets in the way,While this book is about an important topic - racism in the Red Sox organization and baseball in general - it is so poorly written that the writing gets in the way of the ideas.I cannot believe that the other reviewers actually read the book!
4,Who Was Charles Stuart,"I can't say whether I would've liked the entire book. But I can say that the pages I read which included the story of Charles Stuart killing his wife for insurance money and blaming it on a black man said much about the racial atmosphere of Boston in 1990.Author delivers the story of Charles Stuart and the murder of his unsuspecting wife with the art of a mystery writer leading a curious reader down a dark and dangerous corridor. The show Law & Order based an episode on the case. I didn't buy the book because of its length and detail, but if I come across it secondhand I'll swipe it up in a minute, if for no other reason than to read about the black man Boston was ready to tar and feather in 1990, until the brother of Charles Stuart came forward with the truth. Please google it! Truth is so much more stranger than fiction."
4,Wow I thought it was the curse of the Babe?,"What an eye opener! However, it did get tedious as he was redundant in his writing and added too much other items other than baseball. A recommend read to all my New England friends who have always claimed how open Boston is to all races. I always thought the ""Curse of the Bambino"" was too simple of an explanation for the Red Sox for not winning. How about one for the Cubs?!?"
3,NOT BAD BUT VERY REPETITIVE,"THIS IS AN INTERESTING BOOK AT TIMES AND VERY TRUE. THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO KEEP TELLING US ABOUT THE WORKOUT JACKIE ROBINSON HAD WITH THE RED SOX THAT WAS STAGED TO COVERUP THE TRUTH ABOUT PREJUDICE ON THE RED SOX. I GOT TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME THING TIME AFTER TIME IN THIS BOOK. ON THE GOOD SIDE HE MAKES A LOT OF POINTS WITH BILL RUSSELL, PUMPSIE GREEN, JIM RICE ETC. HE TRULY SHOWS HOW THE RED SOX HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES SLIP THRU THEIR HANDS BECAUSE OF THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD BLACKS. WORTH READING."
2,Could have used an editor,"While the topic is fascinating, and his use of primary sources (especially the Boston media) is laudable, the writing itself is occasionally brutal. It reads like a first draft. He repeats stories multiple times, and makes assertions that he does not back up. I agree with his thesis and his conclusions for the most part, but he dismisses evidence that doesn't fit his view, and he doesn't really try very hard to determine motives. I was hoping for a ""smoking gun"" in the long debate about who (probably plural) amongst Cronin, Yawkey and Higgins is responsible for this black mark in Red Sox history. Its mainly just he-said, she-said. If you are interested in the topic, as I am, I recommend the book. There are a lot of interesting stories and first-hand accounts. But you might have to cringe a few times while you are reading."
5,intelligent and enlightening,"A wonderful book. If you are a Mormon woman interested in issues of identity, equality, and women's history, this is the book for you. In a culture (LDS) which seems to sometimes homogenize women, this book celebrates women's different experiences. It was inspiring."
1,Historical Cherry-Picking,"A friend of mine once said that you could prove the existence of an Easter bunny by using the Bible. Pick & choose your facts, interpret them by running them through your curling iron, and there you have it: Mormon women have become the trodden-down in the male-dominated world of the Latter-day Saints. It's history tailor-made by self-styled liberal Mormon women who try to flatter themselves by posing as the enlightened elite."
2,"Ummm, an odd interpretation","An odd trill opening, a missed pedal note, dropped last note of a phrase in a couple places - not recommended."
4,Measuring devices/tools,"The tools are exactly what they say they are - precision measuring devices. They are easy to use and having the complete set is an asset. If you want your drawings and cuts to be as close to exact as possible, then you need this tool."
5,Fantastic Product!,"I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for accuracy and quality. I was actually surprised at the quality vs. price; and as always Amazon delivered on time without any hassles or delays. Some people claim the Incra precision protractor's are flimsy, but I didn't find this to be true. Make sure you have a 0.5 mm lead pencil though, because anything larger will not fit through the marking slots."
4,Second volume of P&P cult classics,"Wonderful stuff -- the second collection of work from the legendary P&P family of record labels -- with even a better selection of tracks than the first set! The range of styles here moves past the famous disco tunes that have always been the better known titles in the P&P catalog -- and the set includes some fantastic tunes that run from mellow soul to old school hip hop to post punk funk -- all marked with a revolutionary approach to a groove, and an experimentalism that's quite unusual for the time! Titles include ""The Guardian Angel Is Watching Over Us"" by Golden Flamingo Orchestra, ""Game On"" by Lavaba & E Mallison, ""The Groove I'm In"" by Florence Miller, ""Dust To Dust"" by Cloud One, ""Roller Rink Funk"" by Shift, ""Magic Carpet"" by High Fidelity, ""New York Moving"" by Ahzz, ""Death Rap"" by Margo's Kool Out Crew, ""I Did It Again"" by Jesse Henderson, and ""Willie Rap"" by Willie Wood & Willie Wood Crew."
5,My daughter LOVES this little guy,"What more can I say? My kid loves this bloody dog more than her family. Sleeps with it, plays with it, takes it everywhere. Murphy is the favourite for sure! She is 6 now and still brings it when we go somewhere in the car or stay overnight."
4,"Solid Metal, Smooth Operation, Sleek Design","I love the look and feel of this measuring tape. I use it primarily for photography and filming. There is one major design flaw: No belt clip. It's almost 5"" in diameter, so it doesn't really fit in a pocket. You may want to get a special pouch to attach to your belt in order to hold it if you're going to be using it a lot.Other than that, this is a very solid measuring tape, with a very strong fiberglass tape."
2,"Hmmm... interesting, but definitely not worth buying.","This DVD doesn't look professional. Cheap camera work combined with ok (at best) music make this DVD a mildly entertaining 40 minutes. The sequencing is choppy, cutting between different scenes, it really doesn't flow well. There are maybe a total of 10 girls dancing in this DVD. I bought it so I could play it in the background on mute when I spin at parties, but this is not the right DVD for that. The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club. The last ten minutes of the DVD are a lame interview with some unknown DJ, which is totally pointless."
1,Very short lived!,"In no time these clamps started failing. They will not lock up when trying to tighten them. I have six, all junk. A note to Bessey went unanswered."
2,good and bad,"THE GOOD - Great seller, easy to contact by email, ships promptly, no problems at all.THE BAD - Phone case will cause top slider to separate from bottom keyboard due to clear plastic keyboard cover is too thick. When you close everything up, it causes the screen and keyboard to separate too much which over time messes up the slider hinges"
4,krusell orbit,"I find krusell products to be of a high quality and have purchased both this orbit for my 8525, the cabriolet for my old 8125 and a similar flap type for the 8125. I managed to bust the multdapt gadget off one by sitting on it wrong -but I super glued it back on and it has held for months. They have a lifetime waranty but how much to ship to sweden? Overall good quality and functionality."
2,Shop Around and Find a Better Price,"For the price I thought this was going to be a much higher quality binder. It is actually very average. Do not buy this. Shop around and find a better price.I actually chose to buy this particular binder because, in the picture, it has a V-shaped piece of plastic that presses against the first page. However, the binder I received did not include this piece. I am disappointed by that."
2,Quality less than expected for the price.,Paid a premuim price for an average product. Rings came out of alignment on day one and papers fell out. Not impressed. I could have gotten that from a cheap discount store brand.
2,not a good value - very misleading,"the shrinky dinks refill packet only comes with 8 sheets of shrinky dink paper. there are no extra project ideas nor are there any extra doo dads like findings or blank magnets, nothing that makes the refill pack worth buying. you can go to the shrinky dinks website at shrinky dinks dot com or to dick blick dot com and order shrink film in greater quantities for A LOT cheaper. for instance dick blick has 50 sheets of shrink film for sixteen ninety nine. twice as much as this refill pack but significantly greater value. this refill pack is totally a rip off. only good if you are trying to give a gift and want everything to match nicely."
4,Great Family Fun,"I first used shrinky dinks years ago with my son now eleven, but until recently I could not find the materials any where. This book was a great surprise and a must for any family. I have three children, 11, 6, and 3; we all enjoyed creating with this book. It is difficult to find activites that all my children can enjoy together."
4,Not enough,"The paper is great and we love shrinky dinks, but there are only 8 pages in the refill pack and you can go through them quickly."
2,flimsy,"This sponge basically fell apart after using it once. It would be ok for using on the face, but not sturdy enough to use as a sponge for the body."
5,Fine product at a fair price,"I have been using a natural wool sponge purchased at a spa, and was hesitant to use a ""grass"" sponge because I was under the impression it was too abrasive.I'm very pleased that when my wool sponge finally began to shred, I took a chance on this terrific item from Ebubbles. The sponge is nearly twice the size of the one I replaced, at about half the cost. It is sturdy, good looking, and, most importantly, very comfortable. It is just tough enough to do a nice job of exfoliation while being soft enough to remain luxurious. If you have never bathed with a natural sponge, do yourself the favor."
5,eBubbles Grass Sea Sponge,"Great product, great service. I've bought from eBubbles before, and I would gladly buy from them again."
4,Natural Sea Sponge - The Real Thing,"After using this authentic sea sponge, I can't imagine ever being satisfied with anything else. The sponge may not be as durable as washcloths or body scrubbers, but the feeling of luxury is unrivaled."
2,Insufficient information provided on vendor's website for the application or use of a product.,"This Natural Sea Grass Sponge is not appropriate as a bath sponge, it is too hard. I should have purchased the Sea Wool Sponge. The vendor should make this distinction clear to the buyer before purchase is made!John Latka"
1,Not worth the money; it falls apart.,"This Sponge is terrible! It's not round like the picture, it's more of a rectangle. It seems like it was cut from the middle of a growth, as the top and bottom of the sponge is flat. The shape could be overlooked, but I've had it for a month and it's already falling apart. The sponge split down the middle along what seems like a natural split in how the sponge grew, but it seemed to be glued together. There is sticky material in between the two split parts. The sponge would actually be a lot smaller if the two sides weren't glued together. Such a disappointment!"
3,"Great sppnge, but doesn't last long","I like the slightly rough texture of this sponge, and it works great. However, after only 4 months it is starting to degrade. I fear it will fall apart soon. Will update when I have more info."
3,Just another sponge.,"I bought this item cause someone said it helped remove the soap when using a water softener. It didn't help at all. In my opinion, it's just another sponge and not anything special."
5,soak it up,I had a great experience with this seller. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition. I would definitely transact business with this seller again.
3,"research first, buy later.","I've wanted a sea sponge for the longest time so I finally ordered this one. It came in about a month ago, and I've really enjoyed using it. It has a great, soft texture. Unfortunately I hadn't put much thought into its upkeep, and I noticed some mold spots on it recently. After the fact, I did some research about taking care of your sponge by soaking it periodically in hydrogen peroxide and water, or tea tree oil and water to ward off bacteria...oh well, now I'll know for next time."
2,"Update, sponge is falling apart, splitting everywhere!","Update: Now that I have had this sponge for several months it is totally splitting everywhere and falling apart. I don't know if it is my specific sponge or if this being a ""grass"" sponge meaning it is turning back to individual pieces of grass but I don't know if I can recommend this anymore. Rather frustrating when you pay so much for a sponge that has such a short life.This Grass sea sponge is really really soft on the skin, very pleased. The only reason I have not given this 5 stars as it seems to want to split as a section. I assume it will shortly tear off giving me a smaller sponge than purchased. Until then, this is a really nice bath sponge."
2,She missed half the city!,"I had high hopes for this book, but when I got it I was sorely disappointed -- her definition of Los Angeles completely ignores the San Fernando Valley! Every pointer she had was either for the Basin or for Orange County. Hello -- the San Fernando Valley is part of LA too!"
2,"Fun read, but....","I wish he would have left his personal political beliefs out of it. Bush is evil, he said, but I bet he could find ""Clinton let Bin Laden go three times"" if he tried. Bush stole the election? If he still thinks this, then it is true that liberals can't count, and since this book is based on math..."
2,You're Serious?!,"OK, you've used computers to fool around with Hebrew to come up with this. Allow me to ask some questions.The author allegedly met with Arafat. If you take Arabic and the Koran, what do you come up with?Continuing in that light, If you take Sanskrit and Hindu writings, what appears?Now take any written language. Tibetan and Buddhism, Japanese and Shinto and Buddhism.Are all these going to add up?The author seems to want to go out and present himself as the worlds savior. He is the only thing between survival and total destruction.The scariest part would be people in strategic places beliving this."
1,"Great as farce, rubbish & lies as non-fiction","Just like his first book, Drosnin seeks to profit from the public's ignorance regarding probability and statistics.The exact same ""slight"" of numbers techniques could be used on any lengthy novel. There is nothing more credible here than in numerology of palm reading. Save your money and buy your kid or nephew a science book like ""How Things Really Work"""
2,Nobody or nothing can predict the future.,Book is interesting and amusing at the same time.People thought the world was going to end onJanuary 1st of 2000. It didn't.Nostrodamus couldn't do it either.Show me REAL proof!!!
2,No specific predictions,So far no one has made any specific predictions with the Bible code and all of the authors are using it to promote their own beliefs and agendas.
2,uh...,"According to Drosnin, a Bible code revealed that Bush won the 2000 election in error. Nice to always bring that up, even though 9 independent news sources confirmed that he won. The crybaby Dems wanted a recount until Gore won, which is why the courts stopped the chicanery. Time to lay that to rest. Gore lost. Thanks.Drosnin's credibility drops when he lets his political views color his research. Too bad."
1,Bible code----ZERO STARS,"Matthew 24:40,42,44; 2Timothy 3:1-5; Hebrews 9:28; Matthew 24:4-14; Timothy 4:1-3;Jude 17-21 Here are some signs of the end according the Bible. If you do not believe in the Bible,Why? Then would you base a book on decoding it??? Jesus said,""Take heed that no one deceives you"". True Believers know that the Bible is where you find answers, NOT from non-believers."
1,Why? Why? Why?,"Is there a way to comment on others' reviews? Here's why - above all, the following glaring omission should stand out like a sore thumb, similar to story ""The Emperor's New Clothes"":If, as Drosnin speculates, the Codes were first revealed to us at this particular dangerous era as sort of an early warning system, to enable us to change the course of events in a positive way, then WHY THE HECK DIDN'T DROSNIN (or any other ""insiders"" for that matter) OFFER AN EARLY WARNING RE: THE TSUNAMI and future such disasters which may happen? Also, why don't the ""insiders"" allow the Codes to be used in a benevolent way to reveal cures for chronic illnesses which cause so much suffering?Well, Drosnin? Ripps? Over to you! I wouldn't be the least surprised that you may formulate some smooth response to this, but I assure you, that any response you may give will not cut it with me."
3,Good Science fiction,"It's a very simple matter to run an internet search on any of the references or contacts mentioned Mr. Drosnin's book.Aside from the multitudes of physicists,linguists,mathematicians and bible scholars who refute virtually all of Mr. Drosnin's conclusions (not to mention his methadologies),the most interesting thing to me is the public statements made by all the players in his book e.g Rips,Gans et al who all distance themselves from Mr. Drosnin and his sensationalism. With friends like those..! A silly book. Nonetheless,it has redeeming qualities. It is a fast paced,good read and it makes sense(in a science fiction kind of way) and it certainly offers up food for thought."
3,"I hope this is real - wait, no I dont","No matter if you believe the code is real or not, this is a fascinating read. For myself , I am not yet convinced either way, but why COULDN'T it be true?Regardless, the book is certainly entertaining, and an easy read. It certainly has caused me to do further research, and I am fascinated at the possibility of it being true. It sort of feels like a Dan Brown novel, but always has you looking over your shoulder for the ""got ya!"" that says its all a hoax.If you are looking for absolutes, and the answers to Life the Universe, and Everything, this is not it. But if you appreciate the study of possibilities, and are as interested in the technical side of codes and cryptograms, you will enjoy this book."
4,Nice Follow-Up,"It is not the gripping seller like his introductory book but this sequal of Michael Drosnin is phenomenalogical all the same. You have got to appreciate his credentials: formerly a reporter for the Wallstreet Journal and he is an athiest. Faith follows fact and Drosnin has the objectivity required in light of these supernatural claims. Names and events that are showing up embedded from the plain text of scripture in groups of word-clusters in startling accuracy. However, the first book asks many questions that were not elaborated on in this release such as the status of Damascus. Neither was there much reaction to other contemporary works today such as my favorite work on the subject ""Cracking the Bible Code"" by Satinover or Rambsel's publication that demonstrate much scientific and historical perspectives. However, it is a must for your library for this providential generation."
3,This Book Should Have Been a Pamphlet,This second book does contain some new and interesting information but it is painfully repetative. It was a huge disappointment to plow through the whole book to find that I could have read the chapter summaries at the end and get all the information in a fraction of the time.If you liked the first one you should read this one. My suggestion is to read the summaries first then go back to the actual chapters for more clarification if needed.
2,Just one question,"If this stuff is for real, as Drosnin claims... Why didn't he tell us about September 11th in Bible Code I? :P"
3,More Interesting Than the First Book,This book was a more interesting read than the first book. An interesting theory and thought provoking. I don't believe that it is an exact science but it surely is an entertaining one.
5,A reality Serious Scientists always knew,"The codes have been studied long ago and every serious scientist that investigated agreed to say it was no coincidence. Strangely some pseudo scientists who didn't study it and even didn't read books about it discredited it, why? I don't know.Perhaps truth hurts, but today, we cannot burn people for what they think."
1,A Con Job,"Drosnin says he learned about this from the smartest man he ever met. WRONG! The smartest man he ever met was his publicist, probably himself.This book is nothing more than a random walk and a con job. Save money and interpret cumulous clouds for free. He is probably laughing at his followers. Do a google on him and all will be confirmed."
4,interesting book,"I have the 2 books of Drosnin but i think this new one is more interesting but i agree with other Review its like Indian Jones searching 4 the obelisk, in this second book he needs to put more things of the future or more facts that proves that the code is real"
1,Horrendously exploitive,"People have been predicting TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) for millennia. This book is merely the latest in a long string of predictions that will not come true. It is based on a mathematically invalid belief: that one can extract hidden messages from the Bible. Actually, similar hidden messages can and have been extracted from any long text, like War and Peace.This book feeds into people's insecurities. Sadly to say, the author will probably make a bundle of money deceiving people. I just wish that Amazon had a 0 stars option."
1,The Big Hoax,"My neighbor brought me this book believing strongly that if a brilliant mathmatician did this, it must be true. I was skeptical before I picked it up and had my skepticism vindicated on page 30 when Rips (the mathmatician) found his own name in this so-called ""bible code""!!!!! I gave the book back to my neighbor right then and there. I didn't need to read anything else. It would behoove people who have been swept up in the mania surrounding this book to check out some websites refuting the book, and there are several. Many brilliant and religious people call the book nonsense. In the words of P.T. Barnum, ""there's a sucker born every minute"". Let's not forget folks, we have something called FREE WILL, and we can CHOOSE to alter the future. You don't have to be religious to understand that the Bible itself is prophecy, why would God need to ""hide"" such important messages??????"
1,Ugh...,"Drosnin's agenda is as clear as crystal: liberals have tried to save the world based on his predictions and those evil conservatives have stepped in at every turn to thwart his noble efforts to continue mankind. Enough already. The logic of ""the code"" is at best vacuous and based on the stretches and winks that allow anyone to find exactly what they're looking for in ""research.""If you're a liberal, you'll find yourself pumping your fist in the air as affirmation that all conservatives want to end civilization on this planet. As hilarious as this may sound, it's what most of you believe.If you're a conservative, you won't get very far into this book before you decide to prop up a wobbly table with it, understanding it's just another agendized tome wrapped around a semi-interesting topic.Read it in the store and have a good laugh and then move on. Don't drop any hard-earned pennies on this book. They should sell it on a six-inch roll... at least then it would be useful."
2,Starts promising then fades....,I have to agree with another reviewer that this book probably could have been summed up in a 50 page pamphlet. It starts off interesting then lulls on and on into too much uninteresting stuff.The fact that the book says the end of the world is coming in 2006 is scary and the actions of the G. W. Bush administration with all its warmongering definitely makes it a possibility. But this interesting tidbit is swamped with too much filler. Interesting information given but it is hard to get through.
1,Total fiction!!!,"What a load of garbage, As if God needs to use code to speak to us! I saw Drosnin on TV telling that famous evangelical couple ""Jan and Paul"" that their names are written in bible code and that God says they will be great leaders in the end time! Give me a break. If you buy this book you help support either a con man or a lunatic."
1,Don't waste the two hours to read this book.,"The first ""Bible Code"" book was interesting. It had me convinced and believing there is a code. I was anxious to read Bible Code II and was very disappointed. I could get around the fact that half of the book is a repeat of the first one, but when the author starts telling me some alien being shot down in a steel vehicle is the reason for my being here, then I have to say, what a joke."
1,Don't Believe It! It's a proven hoax,"Scientific American magazine just did a review of this book (""Codified Claptrap"" june 2003 issue). They told how real researchers were able to use the author's code technique to predict NBA championships - and just about anything else. Furthermore, the first Bible Code book predicted Armageddon in the year 2000. What more do you need? The ""code"" can be made to say anything. Save your money and your time......."
1,Katrinka,"I wish I had not wasted the money on this farce. He tries to make a case for the predictions, yet does not print the verses in the Bible in English so we can read it and decide for ourselves. The Bible clearly states ""no man knows only the Father when the end shall come."" I'm sorry but I believe my English Bible not this rubbish.When I saw that he believes the election was stolen from Gore then I knew exactly what kind of nut was doing the writing. He needs to read At Any Cost, then he'd know exactly what kind of a poor looser Gore really is."
1,Honestly.......,"Is this bloke fair dinkum or what? I have never read such utter rubbish in my life! And just a small question for the author... can you make predictions on things BEFORE they happen? You have supposedly ""forseen"" the end of the world via nuclear/atomic destruction, so, if you are so confident, I am willing to give you odds of 100 to 1 that NONE of your predictions take place.... contact me if you are game!"
5,A Must Read,"In Michael Drosnin's book ""Bible Code II The Countdown"" he uncovers secrets revealed in a hidden code found in the old testament. Touching on events such as 9/11 and the assasination of Israeli prime minister Rabin, the code in the torah also reveals a startling prophesy for the near future. If the claims in this book are true, we should all start to pray. The book also refutes the arguments made against the first bible code book. I am normally a skeptic, but I was convinced. Don't dismiss this as crazy, or religious fanatisicm. Read this book! I'm making my whole family do the same."
2,An Interesting Read...,But best taken with a grain of salt. The most dire predictions always sell the most books after all. But he does present a compelling argument that this is real.
2,Fascinating...but WEIRD!,"If you're into this kind of thing, don't read this book just before bedtime. I did, and I still got a good night's sleep."
1,"Santa Claus is more believable, than this trash-book","This trash-book is too much absurd.Santa claus isn't morer absurd than this trash-book.Please, don't waste your money or time, reading this trash-book."
4,Dependable Brendel,"Very convincing performances. I like Brendel a lot and saw him do some of his final recitals in 2002. This is not as dramatic as the live Argerich live performance at the Concertgebouw, but very, very good. Brendel always seems to tell a story with his playing and these are no exception. Well worth owning."
4,Dino-Surprise,"This is a very interesting band. In a way standard slow/mid tempo guitar rock of those days, but with over the top guitar, with intense epic keyboard layers and good vocals. This results in a rather unique style, with fine subtle, melodic songs. There is a fine variation between more and less powerfull ones, which gives an uplifting positive refreshing listening. Because of its harmony it could be enjoyable for any pop/rock fan. It is sweet like sugar to begin, and afterwards shows a good robustness in that it does not get boring, but even turns out to even get better. At least, it didn't disappoint me the last 20 years. I think, with this Greatest you have a very good overview of this band."
5,Revolutionize your woodworking,"I have had the 18 inch t-rule for several years and it became a must-have the first time I used it. Many woodworkers do not realize that measuring and marking are the most important part of woodworking. The better your measuring and marking, the less waste and mistakes you will have. I have since bought several other Incra products and they are all dead accurate.The smaller your project, the more important accuracy becomes. A small jewelry box with a 1/8 inch error will look worse than a 1/8 inch error on a large project.The t-rule should be your very first measuring tool. Once you use it, you'll go back and get several of the other fine Incra products.A word about service: The folks at Incra are wonderful and will help you any way they can. Fabulous product, helpful people who care....how can you beat that?"
5,What a unique book!!!,"I have never seen a children's book like this before! Rather than illustrations, this book tells the story with photographs! My kids and I love to see the transformation of a featherless infant bird into a young adult. It is both an entertaining and educational book with a very touching ending. I would recommend this book to anyone any age; it appeals to both young and old. There is also a lot to see on the book's website. Lots of pictures on this site."
4,A trip back in time.,I really enjoyed David Thompson's book River of Memories. I to grew up in WV and his words brought back visions from my own childhood. This is just a good read to escape from the everyday stress and hassles and return to a time when we valued family more than the materialisms we strive for today.
4,Good resource,This book contains great information and good recipes. I'm certainly looking forward to using it for more of my baking.
2,own lotsa vegan cookbooks,I haven't actually made any of the recipes yet as none of them initially appear appealing.
5,For Goodness Cakes - YES!,"Fran Costigan's peanut butter cookies and oatmeal cookies are both so good, they're practically evil! Thank goodness they are lower in fat than the traditional version.Best of all, since these are vegan, the cookie dough is safe for raw indulgence.Was given this book as a gift - I can't wait to try out some of the cakes."
5,Good Value for the Price,"I really like the wired in test leads, battery test feature, and continuity checker. All the standard meter functions work fine as well. Remarkable to recall what I paid for meters like this twenty years ago."
1,Disappointing.,"I was looking forward to this book, hoping that Flynt would actually reveal something of himself that we didn't already know from the film ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" Leave it to a pornographer to reveal absolutely nothing of importance. The book is really just a play-by-play of his 'career' -- and the writing is slow, at times meandering, and just boring. I've concluded Flynt himself is boring. Among other things, I would have loved to hear about his long feud with High Society publisher Carl Ruderman (one of the world's richest and least-known porn kings), but Flynt bails on us. Instead he opts to recount the demise of his wife and the legal particulars of his case with the Supreme Court. At times it's a bit reminiscent of the undoing of Lenny Bruce, standing on stage reciting court transcripts to a crowd expecting jokes. In the end, it's all just sad, pathetic and SOOOOOO old."
5,Enjoyable and Addictive,"I would prefer an option for turning off the time limit for the Kwazi Quest part of the game. But, otherwise, it's really an enjoyable and addictive game (much like Jewel Quest).If you purchase the CD through amazon.com/J&R; Music and Computer World rather than download the game directly from the game's web site, you won't have to deal with the five-installation limit mentioned by an earlier reviewer; because there is no installation limit when the game is installed from the CD.And, if you purchase the CD through amazon.com/J&R; Music and Computer World rather than download the game directly from the game's web site, you won't have to worry about the authorization # mentioned by an earlier reviewer; because no authorization # is required when the game is installed from the CD."
2,Not Compatible With Wacom Tablets,Although the games are entertaining I cannot use my Wacom Tablet. I am forced to use the mouse and even that is unresponsive at times. Sometimes the cursor sticks and I cannot get it to move. That brings frustration and sucks the fun out of the game.
1,Pure Crap,This is a book based on a great album side that was already based on a GREAT book by Ayn Rand-ANTHEM. Want the real deal? Listen to 2112 while reading ANTHEM. Don't waste your money on this drivel.
3,What happen to the intro of Take Five?,"I just got this CD today (December 5, 2011) and I excitedly played ""Take Five"" first since, in my opinion, the intro on Take Five is by far the best in this album. I was thirteen when i bought this live album. But what the heck happened to the intro? Editing that part of the music was very dissappointing. Darn it!!!"
2,editing damaged a wonder,"Thanks to the music fan from redding, CA and ""MBK"" for that mather who warned me about ""crime-like"" editing job on this CD. The LP is a wonder; Al as a jazz singer supported by a sensitive, sublime band. The voice and the music integrate so well. This live recording is warm and sensual, witty and creative. Al Jarreau never matched himself in any of the studio recordings. I was about to order a CD (I have owned the LP for about 15 yrs) but I would not tolerate any compromising cuts. To rid ""Take Five"" from its intro is a crime."
3,Wonderful recording ruined by the CD format,"Hold on to your LP version. They sliced out vital minutes of seriously grooving music to fit it on CD, not just one song, but several. Travesty!"
5,Pure Pleasure,"This was the very first Al Jarreau album I purchased. I played it so much that it is past worn so I decided to download it. I went to every concert whenever he was in New York City. There is no one like him although Kem sounds quite a bit like him. This is a must purchase cd. The imcomparable Al Jarreau at his best...LIVE!!! Miss hearing more from him because he was recently hospitalized in France. Of special note, Al Jarreau is one of the few artists to have won Grammys in three separate categories -- jazz, pop and R&B; -- like Michael Jackson.Intimacy"
4,A gift for my Aunty,"This CD is very hard to find in stores In Australia so My Aunty,who is a big fan of this album in particular, wanted it on CD asshe only has the vinyl. Now since I bought this for her she haslearnt to love the songs all over again. Thanks Amazon for yourswift delivery and decent prices!"
1,In Agreement,"I find myself in agreement with the reviewer ""MBK"" and share his/her frustration regarding the terrible editing job done to fit this album onto CD. I also bought this recording on vinyl years ago and loved it......and I also was looking forward to hearing it again on CD. I found the sound quality murky and muddy, and was shocked to find the beginning of ""Take Five"" hacked off almost in its entirety....one of the best song intro's I've ever heard. My advice....wait for the real thing (some day, hopefully)."
2,"Very well written, but the immorality spoils it","I have always liked Dorothy Gilman's Mrs Polifax novels. They are well-written spy stories with danger and suspense, but no graphic violence or immorality.In Caravan, Gilman writes a much more serious story of survival and hardship. Without giving the plot away, i will say that the story is riveting and well written. What kills the story is the sexual immorality she includes-not just mentioning it, but JUSTIFYING it! No matter what hardships we face, we MUST stay true to right values and live a decent life-this the main character (Charissa) failed to do.When she found out that her husband killed her lover, she contemplating killing him, but didn't. Good-it showed she has decency and a knowledge of right and wrong. But this evaluation was turned on its head when instead she enters an adulterous relationship for DECADES! It is really showing how sick society is when this is supposed to be the heroine of the story!"
4,Love it but it's little,"Gave this toy as a Christmas present and the little 4 year old loved it. Thought it would be wise to let buyers know this figurine is about the size of a 4in. Polly Pocket and the pieces that come with it are also extremely small. Truck is the size of a polly car as well but made of all wood. I thought this doll was Barbie size but it is FAR from that!So, be careful of small pieces.Overall a fun toy just a bit misleading"
1,This is not a diameter adapter,"I purchased this adapter to combine the standard 3/8 in rods used for 6"" and larger brushes with the standard 1/4"" rods used for pellet stove brushes. Sounds like I need a 1/4"" - 3/8"" adapter like this? Wrong!The diameter of the adapter openings is 3/8"" on the small side and 5/8"" on the larger. Rutland says it's supposed to be that way to adapt THEIR rods. If you have rods made by other companies with these diameters and you need to adapt them with different thread counts this is for you.If you need to couple standard rods with the 1/4 and 3/8 diameter do not waste your money. This is not what you need."
1,Incorrect product description,"First ordered a 1/4"" flexible rod for a 6"" chimney brush. When items arrived found that the 6"" chimney brush had 3/8"" thread. So ordered a 3/8"" thread to 1/4"" reducer listed along with products on Amazon. When the reducer arrived in a package labeled 1/4"" thread to 3/8"" thread, discovered one end of the fitting will go on the 3/8"" thread of the brush but the other was for a 5/8"" thread. Company allowed sending back the reducer but buyer pays postage and no offer to send a 3/8"" to 1/4"" reducer if in fact they have it. Now will have to try to find the reducer at a local hardware store, if not, then will send back the flexible rod and chimney brush since they can not be matched."
5,Outstanding value and safety,"This jacket is unbelievable, considering the price. It provides the warmth of jackets in the $80-$100 range. Reflective fabric is used throughout the jacket, a plus for kids who ride their bikes in the street or walk to school in stormy weather. I don't know of any other manufacturers who make stylish, reflective jackets for a reasonable price."
2,Totally blows,I confess I have not used the product for more than 2 minutes. I decided to toss it when I realized it can't insert a form on the page (you have to type the HTML manually). I suppose for $20 I should have lowered my expectations.
1,Not Worth even $20 bucks,"I had started working on a web page using a free editor. I then bought this editor, only to find out that it cannot read HTML format. What web page editor can't read the language of the web?The free program (nVu) is so much better."
2,disappointed,"Having read the original paper back version many times, I was looking forward to the e version. The paper back is over sized and heavy for achy hands. So imagine my great diappointment to find the e-version missing the first major chapters and everything else all scrambled around. The other books in the series are pretty true to the paper versions. I can only think that the demise of Justice House/Yellow Rose and copy rights had something to do with this much torn a part version. Or it was simpler to convert her website version of this story, since this e-version pretty much matches up with the way the story goes on her website. Perhaps Missy should create a bunch of short stories to fill in the missing parts of all her stories. I can think of a bunch of events that are just mentioned in passing that would be great to know more about."
2,Original Version is Better,"The original version, no longer in print, was a better book. It included Dar and Kerry's first Christmas together, a Christmas-Birthday party with Kerry's siblings, how Chino ""Capacino's entrance, a New Year's Eve Party and Dar's father's entrance was much more sweet and much, much more. The visit to the Retreat was silly in the new version. Dar's departure from ILS made more sense in the orginal version. While this version added some good parts such as Michelle's visit and Jose and Dar making peace, this additional information while nice, the first was still better. If you can get your hands on the original compare the two. The five star ratings would probably drop down to two or three."
1,Great story,"For all the Missy Good fans who cannot find a used copy of this book, please note that RCE will be publishing a 2nd edition later this year (2007.) Ms. Good is doing substantial rewrites and additions for this new edition.RCE is the only publisher currently authorized by Ms. Good to publish this title."
2,these guys are weird,"i dont dislike the nonsinging, the music is very enjoyable but after a while it gets boring, very boring"
4,A very good album,"I own the EP and Australasia. They didn't really prepare me for Fire. This CD is so melodic in places. The hammering and shredding is still around though, the song ""March into the Sea"" has one of the heaviest opening riffs ever recorded. This album is just awesome. I'm glad Pelican is making music like this."
4,Surprisingly beleivable,"Unlike the usual smart alec mil-sf heroes, Drak and his squad of assorted aliens go where brass sends them, shoot enemy, get shot at, do not know big picture until much later and do NOT save the universe by daring action. The general feeling is not one of adventure, but of hard, unpleasant, dangerous work that has to be done.This basic honesty and unwillingness to entertain is strangely charming, reminding me of WW2 memoirs. Buy this book if you like careful, unhurried world-building for the sake of itself. Do not buy it if you like adventure and galactic intrigue."
2,Disappointed,"Rick Shelley is a talented author but he needs to find something new for his books. There is really no difference between Spec Ops and his last several novels. The story line, tactics, hardware, and such are just blurring together. I do wish he would branch to something different, not just more of the same stories in the same basic setting."
1,say ciao to this toaster,"I bought this toaster at a post-christmas sale so, alas, I cannot return it. The Italians make good looking appliances alright, but the performance is worse than poor. Sometimes it finishes toasting without popping up and just shuts off, resulting in cold toast stuck down in the slots. Often it burns the toast. Pewww. It has a 'defrost' button and a bagel button with no discernable effects. It also has an interrupt button which does not work. But I Must say, those buttons look impressive. Guests see it on my kitchen counter and comment on its classy appearance. I would give it away to one of them but this could damage the friendship. As an aside, I had a roommate once who owned a de longhi space heater, and it died a premature death too. Avoid this toaster and this brand of appliance."
1,can't afford to shop like this,Toaster was defective. Had to send it back. Cost me $20 in shipping and I have nothing to show for it.
5,Back when hockey was played by real men.,"This book is a must read for all current and former Islander fans. So many great memories were rehashed while reading this book. The only problem I had with this book was that it had to end. By the way, not only should fans read this book, it should be required reading material for all current islanders' players. The book will bring you back to a better time and place when there were no ads on the boards, no half naked 16 year old girls skating between whistles, no instigation penalties, and most importantly, when the NY Rangers did not have the means to buy a Stanley Cup. Too bad hockey turned into the traveling circus as it is today."
5,FANtastic,"Being an Islanders fan since 1972 I could not put the book down.. It was great reading about those great moments again about a once great team. Since the team has been so dismal since those great years, it was enjoyable reading about positive historic moments in Islanders history that is basically forgotten as the book alludes to. The book brought back those memories in a play by play manner to make you relive those moments again. Even for non Islanders fans the book would perk interest.Once they move to Brooklyn, sadly I will not longer be an Islanders fan because the NY Islanders were Long Island's team as the book pointed to as well."
5,Hendrix - Finale,"This is what Jimi was going to release later. It also had takes of previously released songs (not the recorded version that We have on previous releases). If You are a Hendrix fan, Your collection is not complete until You have this in Your Jimi Hendrix collection."
3,TRACK LISTING,1) Trash Man (Hendrix) 3:162) Midnight Lightning (Hendrix) 3:523) Hear My Train a Comin' (Hendrix) 5:184) Gypsy Boy (New Rising Sun) (Hendrix) 3:515) Blue Suede Shoes (Perkins) 3:286) Machine Gun (Hendrix) 7:277) Once I Had a Woman (Hendrix) 5:448) Beginnings (Hendrix)
4,very practical,"Whether the difficult conversation is with your spouse, boss, teenager or just yourself this is a great resource to help sort out what the real issues are."
5,Excellent book for non-confrontational people.,This book is great for those people who either don't communicate well or don't want to communicate at all. It is a good follow-up to the book Boundaries. Very helpful for teachers.
1,Did the Pope Write it?,"I bought this book looking forward to being able to become more assertive and to handle criticism or have difficult conversations with anyone. I started reading and to my dismay, there was a quote from the Bible. I thought this was just an example, in order to make a point, but the more I read, the more Biblical quotes started pouring from every page! I don't have a problem with religion, but this is not what I paid for. Finally, I turned to the back of the book, and the first shelving recommendation is Christian Living!!! Unbelievable! I was expecting a book that would give practical, scientific (the writers have doctorates) advice about a difficulty I am having, but instead, it is written for a religious Christian audience in mind."
4,not really waterproof,"These aren't waterproof. When immersed in a bowl of tap water, some water got in one side and fogged the prisms. I exchanged one pair, tried a replacement and saw the same result. Steiner's USA service center recommended another model, the7x30 Commander XPwhich is rated waterproof to a depth of 10m, but I haven't tested them.The 8x30 Navigator optics are really excellent. Focus is sharp across the entire field of view, and the coating improves contrast without being obnoxious. They're fairly light and very comfortable to hold."
4,Yum,"These taste wonderful. I've never tasted apple in this candy. It has always tasted and smelled like strawberries. Soft, great flavor. Black Forest has quality products."
1,blech,"These don't taste very good. And they're made with apple juice, not strawberry juice. As such, the taste comes unexpectedly. Skip these!"
2,Made In China!,"We also purchased some replacement pieces of Pfaltzgraff Cappuccino pattern dinnerware from Amazon. Yesterday a very well packaged box arrived with our four Pfaltzgraff Cappuccino Bowls. As soon as I opened the box I realized that there was a problem. Not only are they made in China but they are slightly taller (1/4"" taller) than the original bowls that were made in the US.Regarding the quality and color; they looked very good. The gloss level and color is a perfect match.These are going back to Amazon. I am very disappointed."
2,Definitely One Of Her Worst Albums,Very inconsistent album with no great songs. Several are ok (Together Again and One of These Days) but this is the only album of hers that does not have at least one or two standout tracks. The live songs ruin the flow and should not have been included! Avoid.
3,"Consistent with her more traditional material, a good mix.","There is a song on this album, ""Sin City"" which has long been a puzzle for me. The words seem to reflect a complex story, but without knowing the story, the song does not make sense. I would welcome feedback from anyone having knowledge of the song's background. It is a sad and moving song, just not sure what it all means.As for the balance of the album, it is classic Harris through and through. It has some of her best ""early"" material and is an excellent mix of songs so it does not seem at all repeticious. Well worth the money."
4,easy listening,i like emmylou. a lot of sound from such a petite gal. easy listening as i drive down the turnpike.
5,ipod Music,"It is hard to write a review for each one of Emmylou's albums, because all of her music is really good!so just put on your headphone and enjoy it!!!And if you listened to the samples without headphones and weren't impressed, put on your headphones and listen again!!"
3,Bradley Smoker Jerky Racks,"I bought these racks to smoke small and soft type meats and fish without falling through the mesh. Advertised as non-stick Teflon coated, I thought I wouldn't have to deal with pre-spraying the racks with a non-stick coating and that the wash-up would be a breeze. There weren't any instructions to ""season"" them, so after the first washing they went into the smoker untreated. The Salmon I was smoking stuck to the racks worse then on the original ones. Clean-up was quite a chore. After a pat down drying, I left them to air dry any H2O that I missed. The next morning there was a small rust spot at each of the wire crossings. They do work fine, but I'm back to using non stick spray. Unfortunately, like too many goods, they're made in China."
1,jerky rack stick really bad,"I bought these racks for a christmas present for my husband. He made some venison jerky on them. The meat stuck on them so bad, it took us an hour to poke all the meat off of every single hole in the rack ( we had 4 racks worth). Will not use these again and would not recommend these to any one."
2,junk,"Jerky stuck to the non stick surface, I emailed bradley to find out why and they never replied back, poor customer service.Just use the racks that come with your unit and hang the jerkey using toothpicks, the jerky racks are too small to use this way."
3,Dimensions given in the description are wrong,"I do not have a Bradley smoker, but ordered these for my Masterbuilt smoker because the dimensions given in the product description (""Measures 13 by 11 by 1 inches each"") would have worked beautifully in my smoker. The actual dimensions of each rack turned out to be 15 inches by 11 1/2 inches by 1 inch which didn't fit. If you're handy and you have a zip tool, you can cut them down (as I did) fairly easily, but not something I'm happy doing with a brand new product.And by the way, the dimensions given further down the page in the ""Product Details"" section (""16 x 13 x 15 inches"") are not only wrong, they don't even make sense."
1,Falls Very Short,"How can you defend ""Sola Scriptura"" to the Church who put the bible together. The Catholic Church was the only church that existed before the Reformation. It chose the writings to be included in the bible in 300 A.D. - The ""Scriptura"" came from the Catholic Church. That is like ME telling YOU about your own life. Or Luther telling the apostle Paul ""Faith alone"" when the apostle clearly states he is ""working out his salvation with fear and trembling"". THE SPIN just does not make sense."
5,got it,thanks a lot I got my film two days back earlier than my expectation thanks againsuresh khetanmumbai india
2,village christmas,"very tiny book and don't evpect it to be the same as her other warm funny ones l love. no need to buy this one nothing really new. only 55 pages need l say more. l love her books reminds me of happy times there with loving funny people yes its great chester is the best, good food wonderful people go."
3,The first edition was one of the best written on the power of praise and worship!,"I read the first book when it came out (I think more than 20 years ago). His own experience about praising God during difficult times was amazing! His teaching (in the book) about the Name of Jesus, the Blood of Jesus and the power of praise and worship were almost identical to what Derek Prince was preaching. I like Derek's teachings. So enjoyed reading from Mr. Laws But the additional story about his second wife and explanation about his divorce in the new edition was not necessary. This book used to be the first one I recommend when people face tragedies. I won't recommend this edition to any one lost husband or wife."
4,praise,Good book about how Gods grace is suffient no matter what trials we face. We need to praise God through every situation.
5,Just Plain Silly!,"This was a very fun and entertaining movie. The name selected for this movie is very apt. It's about three kids who are bored and wind up getting into mischief. The pacing is great and the content works for young children. One of the best in its genre! In fact, it would be nice if other makers of children's movies would take the time to learn a lesson here. This movie was fun and entertaining. It didn't go out of its way to beat you over the head with some moral that was forced out of the plot in some way."
5,A Fun and Energetic Movie,"I can't remember when I've had so much fun watching a movie. This movie is about 3 young boys who have just gotten out of school for the summer and can't think of anything to do. So, they proceed to get into various types of mischief. But it's all in fun and it's fun to watch. The 3 boys who play the leading roles did such a remarkable job. I thought they were fantastic. Some reviews have complained about too much screaming in this movie. I don't agree. I mean, after all, what's a kid's movie without a few screams? The supporting cast in the movie stayed mostly in the background. The 3 leads were almost always out front. But that's what made the movie good. It was about the 3 boys and their quest for adventure without adults telling them what to do. They just wanted to have fun. This movie is not hard to find. I bought the DVD on-line. I recommend it for children (especially boys) as well as for adults. So watch it and be energized."
1,I agree with wordy and overrated,"As a reader with two graduate degrees from brick and mortar universities (CUA, JHU) I also felt the book was pretentious and wordy, for the sake perhaps of adding word count to a dissertation. I thought the material was unnecessarily dense, even though otherwise valid or interesting. This was one of the few books that I have thrown out."
1,Wordy and overrated,"This book is meant for an upper level college student or a graduate student education. It is not about ghosts as much as it is about how the correlation between memories and photographs are types of ghostly experiences, haunting experiences of our own pasts. It is wordy and pretentious. The writer says in an entire chapter which anyone could say in two to three paragraphs. The more she writes the more circles she draws around her points and the less clear he point becomes. Unless you are a psychology major or you want to waste your free time."
3,"Startling, eye opener book on illiteracy in our country.","Kozol gives the reader an overview of the problem of illiteracy in our country. Yet, he gives the information in a way that is not tangible to all readers. Kozol being an educated man writes the book in the way he thinks and comprehens the material. A way many individuals might not capture. In order to have illiteracy be known in our country Kozol should have displayed it in the way many people are able to understand. He would have caputured a bigger audience.Although I feel Kozol should have written the book with the audience in mind he does give the reader startling facts. Facts that we are able to understand. Facts such as , illiteracy will just not go away by itself, and how damaging it is and has been in our workplace, family and society. He raises awareness that makes the educated reader want to find a way to participate in conquering this never ending battle."
3,Who is this book for?,"Kozol writes about a serious social problem that affects our country today. He does bring it to our attention in a to the point way, but at the same time he also loses the reader. The queston is: Who is Kozol trying to relate this message to? We all know that Kozol is an educated person and his use of language shows it. His use of words makes this a difficult book to read if you don't have a dictionary near by. If he is trying to reach out and have the common person stand up to illiteracy, he loses them with his language. Only a very educated, literate person will understand what is being written. This is the main weakness of this work"
2,Informative but repetative.,"We had to read this book for our critical reading writing and research class. I found it very redundant and repetative. I can see his point that something needs to be done about illiteracy, but after about 2 chapters hes saying the same thing over and over again. Also, the statistics drove me nuts. But I learned quite a bit. Get this book if you are interested in this subject. If you have to read it for a class, try not to fall asleep."
2,"very difficult to read, but informative","i read this book for an english class i am taking at skyline college in san bruno california, i found the book very informative on the topic of illiteracy, the author has a genuine concern for the illiterate population in america, he is educated on the topic and pontential solutions. But the text seemed rather difficult to understand and the messages that he is trying to say. his choice of words are sometimes confusing, it made reading the book very tiring and chore like. but, overall, for the audience i think he was trying to reach, and the information he wanted to share, the book did its job"
2,Lacking in charm,"I was expecting a light, golden age type of mystery. What I found was a mystery largely lacking in charm with many unattractive characters, lots of slurs toward the gay characters, a very annoying character who speaks constantly in gaelic and a whole lot of typos and spacing mistakes. Not an enjoyable read."
4,DUPLICATE--but Original,"A better detective story than others by this author we have read. Inspector Hemingway does a good job of discovering the persons who strangled a blackmailer / drug-dealer and his mistress. The identity of the first murderer comes as a distinct surprise, although the alert reader will latch onto the second murderer as soon as the Marriages and Legitimacy Act is mentioned. Several good red herrings, a nice use of the drug trade, and plenty of wit and amusing characters (Insp. Grant, Cynthia Haddington, Lord Guisborough) make this a memorable tale."
4,worth reading for Hemmingway,"Even though this is one of my least favorite of Heyer's books, it's still worth reading. She is that good! Chief Inspector Hemmingway is an enjoyable character from earlier mystery novels and, while he isn't at his most humorous, he's still fun. It's mildly interesting to see what happened with Jim Kane and Terrible Timmy from an earlier book but I can't get too interested in the sullen heroine with a Secret Past. Well written and an OK couple of murders. If you've never read Heyer, don't start with this one."
4,Heyer mystery,"For those of us, and there are hundreds, who are long-time, dedicated Georgette Heyer readers, this book is one of her tries at a modern murder mystery. It is an enjoyable read, particularly after Inspector Hemingway enters the scene. If you have never read Heyer before, however, I would not recommend this as your first book. Read the Regency novels first and I think you too will be hooked on her work. Then try reading her mysteries and historicals."
5,Duplicate Death,This was a well thought out mystery. It kept me guessing nearly to the end. I enjoyed revisiting the Kanes from one of the authors mysteries.
5,Heyer Mystery Review,I have read all twelve of Heyer's mysteries and enjoyed them all. She always has at least a couple of fascinating characters that linger in memory after the mystery is solved.
1,easy to pinch fingers,My 11 mo. daughter likes to read books by herself and everytime she picks up this book she pinches her fingers. The binding side has a shape cut out to make the book look like a phone. She puts her fingers in the hole when the book is open and then tries to close it and her fingers are stuck and she starts crying. So I've put the book away.
1,No product Support,Would not recover e-mail older than one year. Would not recover photos I had recently deleted.Wrote 3 requests for help and did not receive a reply. Don't waste your money on this product.
2,Find a better edition,"In this review I refer to this edition,from Filiquarian Publishing,only. Without question this document has extreme historical and philosophical importance. Everyone who has an interest in the history of Zionism, Israel, Jewish migration and development, or even just a general interest in sociology or economics should have a copy in their library. But not this edition! It is so rife with typographical errors, misspellings, dropped words and such that it is often unreadable. An hour or two's work by a copy editor would have made a world of difference."
4,A key historical document,"First published in 1896, this book gave rise to modern Zionism. Given the impact of the Middle East situation on the planet, this book should be read by everyone to better understand the world we live in today.For me, two things stand out from the book. Firstly, the ""internalisation"" of anti-semitism (see ""Causes of Anti-Semitism"" on page 23) whereby Herzl himself accepts (in my view quite wrongly) that European anti-semitism is inevitable due to certain characteristics of the Jews. Secondly, although leaving the question open of whether to emigrate to Argentina or Palestine to create the Jewish state, in either case Herzl just ignores the fact that both countries were inhabited, with people who might not want incomers creating a new state for themselves in their midst."
5,The Bible of Zionism,"This book is the basis of how the state Israel should be created according to the end of the 19th century ""Wiener"" Theodor Herzl.In fact many of his considerings were used to create the zionist state Israel, except his idealistic and visionary view where Palestinians (Filistines originally from the Greek island Philistos) were given ""a piece of the cake"": jews and Palestinians were considered in his opinion to live peacefully and happy together in this ""altneuland"" or""aviv""."
3,Expose the truth from their mouths,"It describes the real Israeli. How they plan to destroy the world. Read and learn the lies, the destruction and the conspiracy.I don't understand how the west knew about this book and they still support Israel.It is true that he described the reasons behind his talk, about the suffering of he Jews in Europe, but that doesn't justify the methods he is calling for."
2,Jewish State,"Not the best book to read on the subject, lacked a lot of information and found it to be not very interesting. Have read better ones on this subject."
1,"Worst I've Seen, and I've Seen Plenty of Anime","***(Review applies only to disc 1 of this series)***This is the worst anime I have seen since I became an anime fan over 10 years ago. Fans of FLCL will notice how similar the two shows are. However, I liked FLCL infinitely more than this even though I don't consider myself as much of a fan (of FLCL) as most. I actually never made it through the first disc of MSAA. It's not funny, it's not cute, the animation starts out fine, but goes south FAST. The dub is just dreadful, and I am normally a fan of dubs, especially ones from ADV. On top of all that there seems to be no real plot. I've stopped watching maybe 2 anime at some point in a series because of sheer boredom, but never because of being completely irritated and disgusted.If you're a serious anime fan don't let the cute girls on the dvd cover fool you into thinking this is worth your time! And seriously, if you're REALLY curious though just rent it, don't buy."
2,"6,000 Team Members! 6,000 Team Members! 6,000 Team Members!","I had this as a text book for an organizational leadership class at the master's degree level. The material is repetitive in its chapter presentations, but the core elements are still good. I just didn't find it to be reader-friendly. For some reason the authors feel compelled to remind the reader every few paragraphs that the responses of more than ""6,000 team members"" form the basis of their conclusions. I understood that point based on the title and didn't need to be reminded on each page. The book reads as if someone went straight to print with their research paper, rather than making it an engaging read. By chapter 3 I no longer cared about the value of the content, I just hated the book. Seriously. You've been warned."
4,When Teams Work Best,This book is a good resource for anyone working on a team. There are easy to follow examples and graphs. It is a pretty easy read.
4,Car Visor Registration Holder,"Just the place to have those important records when the highway patrol officer asks, ""License and registration please?"""
4,TuneBase is a quality Buy,"I got this for $30 bucks after spurging for iTrip and RoadTrip, which both broke. The TuneBase is a Quality product for people who what an FM transmitter for their car without spending mucho dollars for custom installation."
1,Not good,This product already broke.It sits in my truck in the lighter and it already broke. It is currently taped up.not worth buying
4,"Good, handy, some movement","Item works really well and is easy to use. The flexible neck makes it a cinch to position however you want! It doesn't hold quite tight enough in my accessory plug, so vibration from the road combined with the weight of the Ipod cause it to slowly rotate to either side rather than stay upright, which is something of an annoyance."
1,DOES NOT WORK,This product did not work at all. Would not transmit unless you were holding onto it. I heard similar complaints at the store where it was purchased.
1,Piece of garbage!!!,Bought this thing at Best Buy...always heard static to the point that it drove me mad...ripped it out of the charger and through it our of my car.
1,horrible,I used this for about a month and a half before i returned it. The sound quality is horrible and yes I read the directions. I like my music without static thank you!
4,Good ipod tuner/ charger,This unit works well and I use it everyday with my 2nd Gen Nano. It does experience some interference but it is manageable and somewhat like the normal FM interference that I experience on my 4runner's radio. But the tunebase's shortcomings are more than offset by my being able to listen to my music while driving rather than the commercial filled radio stations.
1,AWFUL!!!,I used the DLO Transpod for a couple years before it finally wore it. I thought I'd give this one a try and all I get is STATIC STATIC STATIC. The reception is nowhere near as good as with the Transpod. I'm returning it ASAP and buying a new Transpod.
1,Too much interference,"If you love a nice sound, this is not a good product. Has a lot of interference and it is impossible to have a good signal."
1,SUCKS!!! DON'T BUY BELKIN,This product sucks. I'm in the market for another FM transmitter that actually transmits to a station without constant static.
1,broke off in my lighter,"I thought this would be a good product. I wanted something that would work in the car. The problem was even if I found a station that wasn't being broadcast on, it would only work marginally. There was always static on it. Once the car was moving, it would float and the static would get worse. Part of the adapter (that fit inside the lighter) got stuck inside and wouldn't come out. So, now the metal ring doesn't keep the lighter in place and it comes out and rolls on the floor.I took the transmitter back for a refund and got a cassette iPod adapter instead. That works so much better! No static. Save yourself some time and money and just get a casette adapter instead."
2,Buy a different FM transmitter,"I bought the TuneBase because I really liked the idea of having preset buttons. Unfortunately, there was so much static and interference that it didn't matter how many preset buttons it had. I was constantly having to change the station to try to find one that was somewhat clear. I live in a suburban area with a few empty stations, so I'm not sure why the TuneBase had so many problems -- except that it's just not made that well. I stopped using it after a week and bought a different FM transmitter. I'm giving it two stars, because I think it has a good design and some nice features, but the actual FM transmitter part doesn't function very well."
1,Money well wasted,"Very bad product...Crapped out on me within a month, and couldn't return it. But when it did work there was alot of static. Just goes to show higher price doesn't mean better product. If you like static with your music, Buy it."
4,Tunebase is A-okay,"The Belkin TuneBase works just fine. It's not perfect but I'm not sure any of them are. Yes, there is interference no matter what frequency you set it on. But unless you are playing a slow or soft song, you don't really here it. Even then, it's only slightly annoying but not to the point where you feel like you want to shut it off. The device fits firmly in my car's cigarette lighter and doesn't budge at all. I recommend this product. Enjoy!"
2,What a piece of junk! It works great before it breaks. . .,"My husband and I each had one of these. We each loved it--great reception, wonderful range of stations, easy access. Both had the SAME PROBLEM. They snapped off in our cigarette lighter for no apparent reason. His lasted 3 months, so we thought it was a fluke, but mine only lasted 6 months. For $70, I'd expect it to be better quality. The worst part is that when each of ours broke, they left huge messes--the fuse fell out, we had to dig carefully to get the broken and stuck parts out of our cig lighters. So, if you want a good long-life out of your product, DO NOT buy this."
4,Best of the FM transmitters,"I have had tried many other similar products and hated them all. This one actually works. I used it on a long drive and had to switch stations about 3 times in 6 hours - which is about a tenth of of the number of times I used to have to change the iTrip.Well designed, easy to use - no software on the ipod. One minor complaint is that it starts playing as soon as you tune a station, so if you are listening to books on tape, you have to jog back to the point when you lose reception/changed stations."
1,Bad Static,"I researched products and felt this would be the best one available due to it having a flexible neck. I was excited when I got it in the mail and haven't liked it since. It dumps the channel memory and has bad static. I can't even listen to my IPOD. Im now in the process of trying to return it so I can get something that actually works. If you're feeling adventerous go ahead and try it, if you value your money keep looking."
1,"Belkin Transmitter for iPod, not good at all.","I bought this about a year ago, maybe even more than a year ago. I do not like this transmitter at all, the reception is horrible, you have to keep flipping through trying to find a channel that sounds clear. Even when you find one that sounds clear within a few minutes you have to change the station again. Its annoying. I need to buy a new one. Find a better one, don't buy this one."
1,broke.,so i have had this thing for about a month and it broke today. so i dont know what to do with it now.i mean i cant lie when i first got it it was easy to use and easy to get use to the only thing is sometime the friction noise. but i dont know what to do now with this borken thing.
2,Useless,"I bought this product in the store for 79.99, I wish I had done my homework on it first. At first the product worked fine, yes there was static but I would just find a new station to avoid this problem. The real problem was in the manufacturing. It would constantly get stuck in my Plymouth Neon's charger port and every time I would try to remove it the rubber part on the end would get stuck! I've spent hours messing with this thing and blowing fuses trying to get it out. Also, when going around corners it slips dangerously knocks my ipod onto the floor by my feet while i'm driving. Totally useless."
1,Awful,"The first day I got this on Christmas last year, it fell apart putting it in my car jack. I rigged it so it would work anyway. The audio was never clear, but that's probably the same with all of these similar products. Changing the tuner channel is an enormous hassle. The final straw fell today when, upon attempting to remove it from my car jack, it completely fell to pieces. A good chunk of it is actually now lodged in my AC adapter in my car. Good reviews on here should be treated as anomalies and very lucky buyers: this thing is a terrible product."
2,"Good for charging and mounting, bad for listening.","The FM transmitter is terrible, as are the other 5 FM transmitters i've tried so far. I'm back to the radio shack cassette adapter once again! This unit holds the ipod nicely, and charges while you drive. Thats about it."
4,Depends where you live...,"Periodically, I fool myself into trying yet another iPod FM solution for my car. This unit is very well made and easy to tune, but because the airways in Boston are so crowded it turns out to be just as useless as its predecessors. This is not the manufacturers fault, of course, but Boston dwellers shouldn't waste their money (if you do buy one, the weakest external FM signal is 99.9 - good luck.)"
2,Just OK,The product works OK but not great.You will be able to listen to your Ipod on the FM Radio but the quality is not that great.Also the charger is not very good since I can play the Ipod in the car but the battery will die right away when I take it out of the car.Disappointing for what I expected
4,Efficient and Easy to Install,"If you're not expecting audio perfection, this is an efficient product for listening to your ipod in your car. Where I live, in the Seattle suburbs, it sounds like a very clear radio station. I didn't have to read anything to plug it in which was nice. I would recommend this product highly."
1,Does not work with iPod Classic 80 or 160,"Don't purchase this if you have an iPod Classic 80 or 160, it will not work at all."
5,Two thumbs up,"Looked around on the web for auto docks. I read the reviews and bought the Belkin. Product looks great and works great. As long as you don't live in a huge city I think you'll be able to find ""dead space"" on your radio to tune in the transmitter. Sound is excellent in my Beamer 328i. Doesn't get in the way of the shifter. The flexible support is easy to position and it comes with a ring spacer to make the fit tighter in your 12V outlet. I found I didn't need the spacer. Seems to stay put and is easy to reach. While driving cross-country, I did have to change the transmitter frequency due to new competing FM stations (one time). You can do this with the presents. One reviewer said this was touchy, but if you read the INSTRUCTIONS, you'll have no problems. Over all a great product and I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Has it's pros and cons,"I have been using the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for over a year now. It has its pros and cons to it. Overall it does serve it's purpose to be able to listen to your iPod through your vehicle's FM radio.Pros:*Flexible and swivel arm which makes it great to be able to maneuver so it is not in the way.*Able to use 4 memory buttons to program the best radio channels to use in your area.*iPod will fit securely in placeCons:*Slow battery charger*Unit will power down when vehicle is turned off but the iPod stays on.*wished the iPod sat above the bracket just a little more, difficult to use the wheel when changing songs, adjusting the volume or just powering the iPod down.This is not a bad investment, especially for the ridiculously low price it has been offered at. It serves it's purpose and allows me to listen to my iPod on the road."
2,"Love the concept, hate the product!","I think this product design concept is great. I love the flexibe arm size. It fits great in my car. The CRAPPY part. I live near metro st. louis and i could not hold a signal ANYWHERE! I always had some intereference. whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out. This product did not meet my expectations, especially since the back of the package states I should have crystal clear sound. This is not true. I have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase. I am now waiting to get my DLO transpod 2 in the mail to try it out. I want something to work!!"
3,Does not charge the new ipods,This product works fine if you have an older ipod. It says its compatiable with all ipod nanos. Which it will play any of them but it will NOT CHARGE the nano 4th generation. It does not say that in the product information and it would have been nice to know before I bought it. Kinda pissed me off!
3,Ehhhhh,"Overall i guess it is ok, for the most part it comes in clear but i mean it has better days than someone day ill be driving to school and the sound is crisp and almost perfectthe next day its lke i dont even have the ipod in the dock i think it really depends on how your cars antenna is positionedmine is great for regular radio, but ipod docks dont seem to work well, if FM's dont work i recommend a permanent attachment or an ipod compatible radio deck"
1,Pretty disappointed,I was really just looking for a charger unit and couldn't find one so I bought this one. I plug into an Aux port in my car and the FM transmitter on this unit kept overriding the Aux input and would keep trying to automatically tune the radio and would shut the Aux input off. This made this unit effectively useless to me.
1,"Good item, then turned to Junk!","I bought this item a year ago and totally loved it. It worked perfectly, until about a month ago. This item totally fell apart after taking out of outlet. I tried putting it back together, but it kept doing the exact same thing. Worked great until that point. Has a 3 year warranty, sending for a new one now, so we'll see. I'm sure it will break again, two more years and I will buy another non-Belkin brand. I'm glad they lowered the price because I paid $80 for mine...$80 of trash. That could've been a weeks worth of gas! hahaJust an FYI...If you want something that will last, get something else."
3,What you would expect.,"I though it worked as well as it should, because the audio quality was average. I do not know how any other similar products compare, so not being able to offer another alternative I would say this is a safe buy. The functionality is great and does what it's supposed to do."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I purchased this device with high expectations. I tried the device in 3 different vehicles and with 3 different types of ipods (Nano, Mini, and Video Ipods). I followed the manufacturer's instructions each time and the device failed to work! I purchased another radio transmitter device from another manufacturer and it worked fine. Do not waste your money or your time with the Belkin."
4,This is it!,"This is solution for your traveling iPod! The unit includes adapters for many different iPod models. It also includes fitting to ensure a snug fit into your 12-volt car power adapter. The fit is tight enough that the plug will not rotate with the weight of the iPod.Sound quality is great. It holds your iPod quite securely. You can position your player where it is most convenient and visible!I have two complaints:1. As high volume, you can hear the electronic whine of the charger. This is unavoidable but less at lower frequencies. It may not be noticeable with some music but I am an audio-book listener so I can hear it.2. The controls are little limiting and awkward. Adjusting the transmit volume, which you admittedly do only once, is quite awkward requiring you hold the unit, hold two buttons down while pressing a third. However, selecting a different station is very easy and one-handed.Overall, I am quite please with this and recommend it."
2,"Good Design, Poor Sound","I love the flexible arm on this thing, and it's fairly easy to set up presets. Unfortunately, the sound quality is pretty bad. As others have said, when you're in an area with a lot of radio stations (I'm in Boston), there is tons of static and overlap. I've tried open frequencies all along the dial and nothing seems to work very well. I'm convinced this is a failing of the model, as I've tried the Griffin RoadTrip (which doesn't have as nice of a physical design) and the sound quality on the RoadTrip is stellar. Someone please combine the best of both models!"
1,Avoid it,"This thing is cheaply built and may not even work in your car at all. The ""friction ring"" that is attached to the lighter socket plug is too big for many lighter sockets, so despite the fact there are adapters, that factor alone makes it worthless to many. (It didn't fit in 3 cars I tried it on - 2 toyotas and a BMW). Also, it's tuning system won't work with all cars, and it's packaging and documentation doesn't indicate how one can know.And as I said, it is cheaply built. When I tried to follow it's ""troubleshooting"" tips (very carefully I might add) parts came of in a way that they couldn't be reassembled and the spring it uses to hold the fuse inside of it jammed in it's housing because it is poorly placed in the unit."
3,It's so-so,"The appearence is sleek and the adapter doesn't get in the way of my shifter, yet I can still reach my iPod with ease. It's very adjustable. Black looks great with my interior unlike some of the bright white docks. So, looks department...thumbs up.However, I have very strong radio signal on my car stereo. No matter what station I tune to there is a fuzz noise in the background of the music. Although, my last dock didn't seem to have this problem. Further, operating the presets is a little tricky. It seems and if it would be straighforward but there's a specific order to changing the stations. Not knowing this before hand can cause frustration and an accident. Technology...thumbs down."
2,Unexpected quality of the product...in a bad way :(,"It seriously broke into pieces after I used it a few times. There was this annoying piece of plastic that pretty much ruined the whole product. I tried to put everything back together but missed the spring and never was able to find it again. I was quite upset. Luckily I got well taken care of by Belkin and they were able to send me a new one again.TIP for using this product: once you plug it into the car charger, don't take it out if you don't have to. Unplug the ipod instead; otherwise, you would end up just like me."
4,works better than itrip,"This model has been working much better than the Griffin iTrip (one with just the small dock connector). Very little static and consistent performance. Really like how it plugs into the lighter socket to give it stability and ease of use during driving. So far, so good. Just had the Griffin iTrip replaced with the model with the charger cord and though I haven't used it yet, it looks like the cord is going to pose a hassle and create clutter. After having all three types, I like this Belkin model much better."
1,Eh,"This would be a perfect solution for people who don't have tapedecks in their cars, however... I live in a metropolitan area (central NJ) and I'm in between Philly and NYC. I can NEVER find a free radio station, and when I do, it only lasts for a few miles, and then I pick up static from somewhere else. Not worth the money if you live in an area like me."
4,Love it!,"I really like this product. I live in southern California where it is difficult to find an empty station (I use 88.7), and my iPod sounds good. It doesn't sound like my Bose sound station, but I do not expect it to. I have a stock radio, and the static is minimal. I like that my iPod is charging while I am listening to my music or audiobooks, so it is always ready to go. Having the ipod sit in the crade is very convenient because it is always within arm's reach, and easy to change songs, or volume if need be. I did find that if you do not have the volume on the iPod high enough, and try to compensate with the car radio, there is a lot of static and hissing. After I adjusted the iPod volume to mid range, and the radio to a more normal volume my static and hissing went away! Great product!"
5,Wow.,"Joseph Kerwin's ""the Roots that Clutch"" has an opening paragraph which contains one of the best lines I've ever read. I won't repeat it here, because it would cheat the potential reader out of reflecting back on it after finishing the book. I will tell you, however, that you'll want to read the book through a second time, just to make sure you didn't skip a line somewhere during the read. (much the same way a dog might scour the ground looking for tiny, fallen morsels of an especially tasty, too quickly gobbled, treat)The characters are interesting, interesting to the point of warranting their own stories...You can almost sense that these characters are carrying on somewhere, maybe on the corner - where Past and Present streets intersect, or maybe on a quiet little cul-de-sac just a few blocks from Everywhere, or most likely - in Mr. Kerwin's mind..."
3,Stopping Power: A Practical Analysis of the Latest Handgun Ammunition,I was moderately disappointed with the analysis and presentation of the material.
4,Stopping power,"This book has a real stopping power in every ""my ammo is the best"" discussion. More detailed than I expected, covers practically all types of handgun/rifle ammunition. Not only it can be used as lexicon, it also contains a lot of amusing stories. Unfortunately most of the pictures are ballistic gelatine cavities, I would appreciate also real wounds / authopsy pictures."
1,A really bad and misleading book,"This book and it's authors have been widely discredited by the responsible firearms community. The analysis I is internally inconsistent and based on a ""secret database."" See [...]"
5,"Great book, valuable real world information.","This is really a great book. Opinions about bullet performance are like......well you know. Everyone has one. These guys back their opinions up with literally hundreds if not thousands of practical tests and actual real world shootings involving real people. This is a great book for helping you decide what type of carry ammo to buy, and it's just a flat interesting book to read."
4,Good Info,"Very informative but very long. Goes into very specific ballistics info. Even though it is the most recent book Ive found it could be updated with the most recent ammo products. The info on the FBI and INS ammo testing was very informative. Goes to show that just because a one law enforcement agency uses a certain caliber and kind of ammo, it pays to do your homework and base your choice off of more than just one agency's recommendation. A little pricey but worth it if you are really interested in ammo ballistics."
4,Great Book if you like the subject,I bought it for my father in-law because he is a gun enthusiast. He really seems to like it. Very technical though.
2,Nice but quality is lacking.,"The square itself works alright and I do like the way you can find so many degrees quick and easy. However I do not like whatever material it was made out of, feels very cheap. It looks like it was stamped out and instead of inspected for flaws just tossed into a blister pack and tossed on a truck. I don't know if I just got a dud or if all of them are like this but I won't be buying another to check that out."
4,Very useful for serious home repairs,"Great for re-roofing, attic repairs, and framing out closets in 1-1/2 story older homes. Also a necessity when doing stairs, ramps and furniture building. The instruction manual is a bit dated (looks like it was written in the 20's), but is understandable with a bit of study."
4,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT,Swanson rules when it comes to the speed square. I have this products big brother the 12'' model also and cant imagine life without one.These things are bomb proof. In an everyday carpentry kind of way this tool will last forever.It's an aluminum calculator you can use as a saw guide.on any given day you can walk up to a job site and see these squares hard at work and you know if the industry has adopted it you can rest assured it has proven itself over and over again.Now get out there and square something up.
5,Not just for Contractors,"I am not a contractor, just a normal home owner that does his own woodworking. This tool is great to have at home when working on projects around the house.All markings are very easy to read.I'm glad I picked up this tool. For the money, it is a very valuable tool."
5,"solid, great product","I ordered this after seeing being used on a how to video and boy am I glad I did. This is made for the serious roofer but I am a typical woodworker. It is VERY solid and the lip on one side makes this thing so very easy to use when I need to make a cut mark on the wood. I can't say enough good about this product. If mine came up missing tomorrow, I would order another one right away."
5,Magnificient Tool,"I'm a DIYer homeowner. I enjoy working with wood, but always cringe when having to draw straight lines. This tool makes it so easy and convenient. I'm a huge fan of the speed square. It's the most used tool in my shop now. I'm as happy as a june bug at a Summer concert."
5,"Like the classic 12"" Speed Square, but more compact!","I have the 12"" Speed Square and use it all the time. Sometimes though, the larger square is overkill like when working with molding or 1x4s. This one is just as versatile and durable as the original in a more compact form factor."
5,Super useful,"I don't build roofs (which is what this was designed for), but for drawing cut lines at a 90 or 45 nothing is faster or better. Also works really well as a cutting guide for shorter cuts.Sturdy construction (it doesn't seem like you could ever wear it out) and the only way I won't be using it for the rest of my life is if I happen to lose it somewhere."
5,Better then sliced bread,"All hail the Speed Square, the King of Tools. I have no idea how anyone was able to build anything without these. Get the Swanson best $8 you will ever spend. If these things cost $45 they would still be worth it."
4,Beatles beatles beatles,No beatles fan should go without this coffee cup in tribute to the greatest band ever and one of the greatest albums of all time.
5,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WITH AMBITION,I just finished reading the book and even with my MBA I was amazed that I hadn't tried several of Ms. Kushell's methods for meeting important people before. She writes with style and experience. This book definitely will pay for itself!
3,Stop after the first few chapters. . .,"This book gives some great advice about really looking at who you are and where you want to be in your young life. It challenges the reader to do some real self assessment and constructive criticism, while giving some good advice on how to get there.But this book draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaags. The first few chapters are great and really inspirational, but after that the book never seems to end. I recommend reading it to the point where it starts to bore you and then STOP because it only gets worse from there!"
4,Well known Info but Good Read,"This is the same as other self help books: encouraging, but it has one message that continually stands out in the book: you need to have ambition and a plan. A good guide for someone in their early 20s or late teens. Similar books I would recommend, how to be twice as smart (old book but good advice) and how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegie...."
5,This book is AWESOME!,"This is exactly the book I needed! I've always known I would make it, I've always wanted to make it, I just didn't know how; now I do!Thank you Jennifer and Scott for showing us the way!"
3,Not as good as I'm Starvin',"Unfortunately, Pinette recycled too many jokes for this one. His commentary on food is always pretty funny, but I guess it's hard to beat the first round of laughs."
4,good book,great info for christians who want to enter into intercessory prayer...great info...very useful and insightful...have not read a bad book by Kenneth Hagin yet
2,Buyer Beware,"I recently purchased this item for my daughter for christmas. She had played with a set at her friends house and loved it. After receiving my package I was surprised how small the box was. Upon opening I found that the set was very small despite being 41 pieces. It doesn't even come in any sort of storage container, just a brown cardboard box. I will be returning this set and purchasing the set sold by Target (that is cheaper by the way.)"
4,Building and learning,"I bought this toy for my four year old and after watching him play with his set bought another one for my kindergarten classroom. Learning about magnets as well as using their imaginations to come up with new creations every time, my students and my child never tire of this toy. I do wish there were more pieces, but plan to buy an add on set soon."
5,Building fun,"I got these for my son when he turned four and he still plays with it one year later. They are great quality and allow for creative, unstructured building fun."
2,Not pleased with packaging,I am so upset with this purchase. This is for a Christmas gift and I received it in just a taped up plain cardboard box. There is no manufacture case/packaging as when purchased in the store. The price is excessive for the pieces received even though there are 40. Glad I only paid $19The toy itself is recommended just not as a gift.
4,Great compilation!,"This is great listening for a mellow, romantic evening. It's got some sweet soul, some tasty electric chill, some smooth jazz, all of it quality stuff. Probably some songs you've heard (if you're over 40 you'll recognize hits by Marvin Gaye and Minnie Riperton), and there's lots of great music that I've never heard before this disk. Dusty Springfield and Depeche Mode in the same collection? It works!"
4,Very helpful tool.,"This scraper is great for bread dough. The slick silicone material doesn't stick at all, is very lightweight and I love how easy it is to clean as opposed to metal scrapers. Since my favorite bread shaping surface is a plastic mat a metal scraper is impractical, too.The only reason this didn't quite make 5 stars is that the material is very easily nicked along the edges and I fear that, after awhile, accumulated nicking of the edge will reduce functionality, but at 5 dollars replacing the scraper even once yearly wouldn't be a big deal."
4,Works well,"I have been using this scraper for about 2 months. I purchased it so that I would not have to worry about the counter being nicked or scratched when making breads and rolls.It works very well, easily cleanable and nonstick. It cuts through dough easily and cleans counters well.My only concern is the durability of the product. I too have found that the edges are easily dented and nicked. Even when I received the product, the packaging had caused damage to the edge of the scraper. I would have returned it but I needed the scraper. I agree with other users that it is a good deal for the money. Just be careful when storing and using the scraper to prolong the life of the edges."
2,Durability concerns...,I bought the dough scraper in June 2009. It is already cracking along the seam of the scraper and the grip. I looked on the link to see what the return policy is and I have to pay to ship it back and there's a restocking fee? Not worth it for a $5.00 item...
3,Not the Greatest Dough separator,"I bought this particular dough separator to break up the little chunks of hamburger as they were browning. You can use it on a non-stick pan. It is good for that, although a little short. To me, it is too thick to be an effective dough separator, but that is just me. For tasks like that I would prefer metal."
4,"Handy, easy to use, easy to clean.","My son-in-law and my 13 year old grandson love to take over the kitchen at least one night a week, usually to prepare stir-fry. Since they must slice and chop many ingredients, this Batali scraper is perfect for both to use and it's easy to clean. I also got flexible mats for them to use. My daughter is very happy."
3,Mario's Bench scraper ...,"I got what I bought, a plastic bench scraper. It is thoughtfully designed with a ruler stamped on one side. It works fine, but I still want to get a good ol Metal one. But, that's just me. :)"
4,Great Memories!,"My cousin and I drove around in her yellow Opal, in 1977, listening to this 8-track over and over. It may only have 8 songs, but they're 8 GREAT songs. It brings back a lot of memories and is a must for any Rod Stewart fan."
5,One of Rod's top 3 albums,"I discovered this album in my brother's record collection when I was five and its been one of my favorites ever since. ""Hot Legs"" is a great song with an infectious groove, ""I Was Only Joking"" is the perfect song when you turn 30 (or 40, etc.) and you reflect on where you've been and where you're going. Have you ever been head over heels for someone who completely broke your heart then tried to come back into your life once you had found happiness with someone else? Then you absolutely must hear ""You've Got A Nerve"". And I don't care what anyone else says on other reviews, but ""You Keep Me Hanging On"" is the way the song is supposed to be sung. Granted it was the first version I heard of the song, but when I heard the original version it seemed too happy for the song's subject matter. I really feel that it's the best version I've heard. I highly recommend this album, spend the $9.98 - you won't be disappointed."
5,Still awesome after all these years.....,"I have owned this album for years, but just started listening to it again... I loved this in my teens, but it's just as awesome today. There's not much left to say after reading the ""rave reviews"" on it, but every song is good on this album!"
4,Film Focus (The non score music edition),"This is not the typical Rod Stewart album. Sure Hot Legs and You're in my Heart are but for the most part a deeper Rod lies beneath the lyrics of this cd. From the haunting intro of You Keep Me Hangin On, to the parting line of I was only Joking, there seems to be a message of loss and betrayal. Maybe others don't see that bur I sure felt it the first time I heard You've Got a Nerve. Sure it may have hit home because I was coming out of a relationship but I believe that a message was being sent here. Whether it was aimed at an individual or at relationships in general, well you would have to ask rod himself. But I think it is a great album to listen to after a break-up or remembering one."
3,SOLID STUFF with ONE COLOSSAL CLUNKER,"I love Rod, I really do ... but his rendition of YOU KEEP ME HANGIN' ON has to be one of the all-time most astoundingly awful remakes in pop history! It's sooooo bad, it's actually worth hearing. Elsewhere, Rod delivers on all his strengths -- a spry ballad (YOU'RE IN MY HEART), a soulful cover (IF LOVIN' YOU IS WRONG) and lots of rooster-ish rockers."
5,poppy,"These Films Are Really Well Restored,For Any Fan Of The Great One This Boxed Set Is Real Gem. I Have Been Waiting For This Second Set.. The Added Old T.V. Program About Fields Is Also Very Good.....Dont Miss The Great One.In The Great Boxed Set..... Bill T.. TIN TOP TEXAS"
4,Dunkenfield at his best ....nearly,"My Father hated this man... never thought he was funny...same thing with Groucho... I love both of them.My favorite Fields film is in this colllection... its based on his frustration with movie studio executives and the Hayes office (censors ) ..."" Never Give a Sucker an Even Break "" is THE film to me. The Goats milk scene is priceless ... the open air compartment aeroplane hilarious... and Hills Brothers Parachute.. PERFECTION.Then a nice game with a young blonde... all hail Mr Fields.Get this set .. nothing bad in here."
5,W.C. Legend,"These W. C. Fields collections are a real treasure for all who have enjoyed his work throughout the years. This recent collection finally has some of my favorite movies on them, such as The Old Fashioned Way. I hope that this is not the only other series to be produced and that all his movies will be remastered and available for purchase. He truly was the Great Man"
2,Worse than 6 Short Films,"After purchasing the W.C. Fields' collection 6 SHORT FILMS, I had Volume 2 of the Comedy Collection on my Wish List for nearly two years. I was so excited when it arrived. And so disappointed when only three of the five disks were entertaining. I love W.C. Fields; but, in school, if you get 60% of the answers right, you get a ""D"" & that's how I would grade this collection."
5,Second Time's The Charm,"While the first set of Fields films on DVD did include It's A Gift and The Bank Dick, his two best films, it also included some of his worst and a most overated (You Can't Cheat An Honest Man, My Little Chickadee). This second collection is much more consistant and enjoyable, a comic delight from start to finish. The Man On The Flying Trapeeze and The Old Fashioned Way are both just a half star down from the from venerable It's A Gift, as is the underated You're Telling Me. Even Poppy has it's charms, though Fields was in several back pain during the filming and doubles were used for most long shots. Hopefully this sold well enough to merit a third and final collection which should contain Million Dollar Legs, Tillie And Gus, Six Of A Kind, Mississippi and the strange but enchanting Alice In Wonderland."
3,Broken clamps,"I own a number of these clamps both 12"" and 24"" and find them quite handy and useful. Within the last two weeks,the trigger on two of the 24"" clamps have broken, rendering these clamps useless."
1,Very little clamping power,"I have had good luck with the 12"" version of these clamps, so I asked for a couple of the 24"" version for my birthday. They have noticeably less clamping power than I am accustomed to with the smaller ones and are not up to the challenge of common tasks. I should have gotten the Irwin clamps."
4,Awesome finnish metal!,Short and simple.....this is just another reason why European metal blows most American metal out of the water. Another great album from another great European band.
4,Sophomore Effort Will be Better,"Vocally on this album the vocals are much more brutal, but done with more dynamics than your average death metal band. Musically, extremely good, however nothing jumps out and grabs you too much... not like ""Since the Day it All Came Down.""This album is in no way generic... in its best moments it pays homage to In Flames and Dark Tranquillity without stealing from either of them. I can't stress enough though how much better their next CD is... so get them both, and listen in order. You WILL NOT regret it."
4,New to Christian Ficition,"Abundant Rain was very interesting and a blessing to read. I enjoy reading books by Vanessa Miller. I think this book will be a good gift to a newly married women or young women. Because the book really shows the reader how sometimes we can get so caught up in our relationship with our spouse and forgot that God blessed you with that person. And its great that you love them so much but God comes first in everything. A few times I went to bed late because I just needed to get through the next chapter. Also, this book is #2 in the Rain series."
5,Daily Reflections For Highly Effective People,This little book is an excellent companion to Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. A must have.
2,Of interest only to fit athletes,"This slim volume describes an extreme diet aimed at preventing muscle loss while losing weight rapidly, i.e, athletes taking off a few pounds of fat before a competition. The author says that it is useful only to men and women who already have a low percent body fat. The diet is supported only by anecdotal evidence. I gave it two stars for a lot of detailed metabolic infomation, apparently well researched."
1,truth,This book is garbage. Save your money. Lyle posts on misc.fitness.weights. Read some of his posts before you waste your money.
3,Nice but not sure,"Got the costume, it looks great, though the skirt is a little short. Unfortunately it came damaged, one of the straps is broken on it, so I have to repair it... not fun, especially when you get it just a day before Halloween... The straps obviously aren't attached very securely, which is rather upsetting."
4,Journey or Vaction,"This story had me from the ""small white man""...I read it in one sitting. I have been a long fan of Walter Mosley, but he lost me at Blue Light. Reading this novel brought me back to why I was really interested in his writting. This story holds you on the edge of your seat, and stays with you long after you've finished reading it.This book isn't meant to be skimmed, read it when you have time to savor the story. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a good short read."
2,The Man in My Basement,"I didn't like the book. I really like Mr. Mosley's detective mystery writings, especially his homegrown neighborhood detectives. I really love those characters and this book had none."
2,Not my kind of book...,"I must admit I do not often read this type of book... However, this book was recommended and I found that it was an easy read and it somewhat kept me interested - but interested b/c I couldn't wait to get to the point or rather the ending. Once I got to the end - I was shocked and left feeling let down by the ending. Perhaps it's just not my type of book..."
1,excruciating,"Every fine novelist experiments, and here Mosley tries his hand at Dostoevski's Underground Man or Camus's Stranger. The protagonist, Charles (""not Charlie!"") is merely a pompous, verbose, drunken windbag whose ""philosophy"" is trite barroom cynicism. He muses endlessly about ""Evil"" (which seems to be Rich People) and about his only other topic, himself. The basement cage premise sounds more interesting than what Mosley actually does with it. Don't want to give away the ending, but I waited in vain for the twist that would repay the time wasted. Some growth, understanding, something. I longed for Easy or Fearless, whose actions showed Mosley's real understanding of life. Mosley knows far more than he can verbalize. This book is like watching a great actor try to sing and dance."
3,Promising premise that misses the mark,"I agree with the other reviews in the sense that this story was well written with complex characters. It certainly did provoke many questions. However, this book never goes anywhere. I need some sort of climax. I kept reading as I thought, for sure, something interesting would happen with the guy in the basement but it never did. Why create such an interesting premise to leave it in the dust?"
3,Wasn't enough for me,"Don't get me wrong, I liked the book but just felt that it did not have much climax. The book was written very well, my first by Mosley. It was really weird but still interesting. Great reviews but just not my type of book. Read it, check it out for yourself."
4,Walter Meet Stephen,"I have read many many Walter Mosely novels, and this is the first that reminded me of a Stephen King novel. The tone of the mystery takes a different twist, not the usual criminal suspense, of solving a crime or a wrong doing that cause conflict with one's morals or character. The confict with the main character, Charles has a deeper or different twist, more in the vain of King's characters. There are times when you wonder if the ""Man in the Basement"" is real or imagined. You'll have to read it to find out."
1,Stock/Order picking error,"While I will LOVE this item when I receive it, I am still waiting. Due to stocking/order-picking error, another item is incorrectly barcoded for the item I ordered. Small oversight that hopefully will be corrected soon."
1,Dirty Little Novel,"Charles Blackey is down on his luck and needs money. So he accidently finds a white man who wants to live in his apartment. Fine, but where's the good parts in his book? And besides, the book is really dirty. I don't recommand it to anyone under 16. The book is nothing but a poor depiction of some of the nation's pariahs live their lives. The writing style is terrible. Dry and simple, looks like a high school kid wrote it. Don't waste your time reading this book. There are a lot of better ones out there."
4,Stretch Your Imagination As Far As It Will Go,"""Bizarre"" is how I would describe this book. It goes from being very plausible to unbelievable and then back to the ordinary. Walter Mosely takes his readers on a mind trip. This book is not for wimps. It is not an easy read but it sure is interesting. Never before have my emotions been played with as much by a book as this one."
5,LETS HAVE MORE LIKE THIS!,"A most interesting read. Mr Mosley is a wonderful story teller. This is a smooth, short read and I was amazed that the author could get so much into so few pages. Like any good work, this one can be read on several levels, you pick your own. I very much enjoyed this book and do highly recommend it. Thank you Mr. Mosley!"
2,The Man in My Basement,This was a strange story. I have to admit that I did feel the need to turn the next page to find out what was going to happen next. I liked the overall plot of the story but to get to the end you had to read through a lot of weird stuff. I read this fairly quickly because it flowed nicely but was dissapointed with the ending. This was my 1st Walter Mosley novel.
2,Bizarre and not believable,"I was truly drawn into the novel during the perhaps the first half of the book, and then it just got too bizarre. First, Charles is such an unappealing character and the man in the basement is just not believable. I'm sure there is a lot of philosophy regarding atonement, evil, sin, justification, etc., but it just didn't touch a nerve with me that I was hoping that it would."
2,different but disappointing,"This very different story piqued my interest at the start. Charles Blakey's life seems to be going nowhere, with financial problems mounting up. Then, a strange man (Annisten Bennet) appears and offers Blakey a lot of money to stay for a short time in his basement. The mystery behind Bennet, and Blakey's search for himself through his non-slave American roots impelled me to keep listening to this audio-book. Ultimately, I was not satisfied either with Bennet's secret surfacing not the transformation of Blakey as he deals with Bennet and other issues in his life. This unorthodox story was ultimately neither believable not engaging. Even a good reader could not rescue this somewhat disappointing short novel."
2,"High concept, low substance","This book set up an interesting situation, but I didn't feel it was resolved well. There are many unanswered questions. The ending is much too neat. I don't quite see how Charles becomes so transformed by this experience. I don't quite understand all the mind games his prisoner perpetrates. I never really understood why his prisoner chose to be imprisoned. He rambles on about many things he has done, but the reality of the life he speaks of seems difficult to translate into any kind of practical day to day. Thankfully, it is a fast, short read. I have enjoyed the Easy Rawlins books so much. I understand the need of a prolific author to experiment, as another reviewer pointed out, but this is nowhere near as engaging as the other works by Mosley that I have read."
3,I expected more.,"I simply expected more from this book. For starters, I found myself struggling with the book b/c the narrator was not likable. Then the story itself leaves a lot to be desired. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish the novel, but i just expected more. I think Mosely was trying to teach us something about the world and there was definitley an attempt to convey an underlining theme...but I missed it."
3,"Satisfied, but that's it.","This was the first book I have read by Mosley so I am not familiar with his other books or how he writes. I can say this is NOT what I expected. Saying this it's hard to explain what I had trouble with. I suppose I assumed a more mysterious or evil reasoning for the cage. I just waited for there to be more. There wasn't. I don't think this was a bad book, for the most part I enjoyed it. I just had some other ideas about it and it dissappointed me."
1,Ditto to Disappointing,"What drove me down to only one star was the lack of even a basic discussion of curing and the parameters that can be varied. Rather that discuss basic marinade in a detailed chapter at the front of the book, its relegated to the appendices."
1,Waste of Money,"When I order this book, I was very excited. Upon receipt of the book, I was not impressed with the elaborate presentations. The chef did not give enough basic information for using raw fish in many of these recipes. In two instances, I could not find the ingredients for the dishes I wanted to try. Overall, I did not like this book at all."
5,This is why studios are necessary,"Occasionally a recording comes along that makes you realize why the recording studio was invented. If you like Steely Dan, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and Billie Holiday, Art of Tea is your next blissful pursuit."
5,Flawless Pop Album,"There are only a handful of albums I always listen to straight through. To me, that's the mark of a great album. The Art of Tea falls into this category. Every song is well-crafted and superbly played. This is definitely his best album (I would also highly recommend Sleeping Gypsy). Michael Franks is not for everyone, though. His music is thoughtful and sensitive, so if you like loud, edgy music, avoid this artist. Fans of Steely Dan, Sting, Pat Metheny, and bossa nova will probably enjoy Michael Franks."
2,"Disappointment, despite homework","Despite reading dozens of customer reviews on eye glass wipes, I made an informed decision that I regret. Let mw weigh in on the side of those that did not like these wipes. The first use was good. Every subsequent use has left more to be desired. They are not very moist and leave a smear behind that I end up removing with a microfiber cleaning cloth anyway. Bottom line is that I now just use hot water and a dry lint-free cloth to achieve results."
2,OK but Not As Good As Bausch & Lomb Sight Savers,These cloths clean OK but do not clean as well as the Bausch & Lomb Sight Savers. The level of cleaner contained within each cloth is minimal and I have opened several that were dried out and not usable.
3,Health but a little hard to eat.,These bars are great to have on hand in a pinch. They are packed full of nutrients but they are a little hard to eat. They contain a LOT of fiber and you can tell. Overall not bad though.
3,Clinical Social Work Supervision,"Excellent book, easy to read and understand, a must for any supervisors out there..."
5,"From me, a fan from the beginning","Been a fan of Emmylou's work from way back when. I had the privilege of seeing her perform in Washington, DC many, many times. I would go see her practically every week at a small club venue called The Childe Harold. I remember one evening walking from my car, to the club with some friend's, and who should be coming toward us but none other than Emmylou. I'll never forget her greeting to us...How are you boys this evening? It was spoken songfully in that lilting, gorgeous voice, we were kinda' dumbstruck.Anyway, enough reminiscing, buy this album, beautiful music, you won't regret it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I actually had to force myself to slog through this book. The writing style is similar to ""The Bridges of Madison County"" - a flowery style filled with gratuitous adjectives and ridiculously over-stated descriptions. The plot was alternately absurd and boring. I read this book based on all of the hype and I really expected something interesting. Except for a few brief moments, I found this book to be very easy to put down. The entire experience was an insult to my brain cells."
1,Amazing Rubbish!,"This books start out very well but truly disintegrates in the end. Sloppy, poorly believable plot and no story. The very end is a mess. Avoid this book."
2,A real disappointment,I won't rehash the plot since there are so many reviews before me. I can't believe there was so much hype on this book. It took me weeks to finish it because I just could not get into it. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the last few chapters were real page turners. However the ending was a complete dud.
1,Are you kidding?,"You'd have to be fool to think this is a good novel. As pure fiction it's badly written and unimaginative. But, of course, it postures as ""possible history."" As ""possible"" as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion! It's a pure play at widely held prejudices. Nothing more."
3,I do recommend the illustrated edition,"I would definitely recommend if you're going to read this book that you read the illustrated edition, as I found it was a great help in understanding the points of discussion in the book, myself having limited knowledge on the topics of historical architecture or Leonardo Da Vinci.The book was interesting enough, there where however a few slow parts that I found difficult to get through. Which leads me to question all the attention the book received in the first place? The book is clearly fiction so to all those who seemed to be offended by it I can only say ""Don't believe everything you read""."
5,Page-turning,"Page-turning indeed. I bought the Eng version and it was non-stoppable from p400 onwards. Despite critics on the ""factfulness"" of those ""facts"" as claimed by Brown, I have to say it's an exciting story - I'll read ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" also and will then decide if Brown has committed plagiarism."
5,"Terrific Book! A thriller, mystery and historical book +","I admit I was skeptical about reading a mystery thriller when first introduced to this book. However, the book was much more than just a who done it type of fiction. The book's plot was intermingled with historical details that made the book far more than your typical mystery novel. The book really made an impression on me as far as theology goes. I could not put this book down--it's plot takes so many exciting and unexpected twists. Even if you don't normally read mystery/thriller books, this is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone looking for a great story that gives you some things to think about history and religon-wise."
2,Wait... What's the big deal again?,"I finally got around to reading this the other day and I can't figure out what's the big deal or why it's any more popular than, let's say, any formulaic Dean Koontz (or pick any number other thriller stories where guy and girl run from some mysterious baddy.) The surprises are totally unsurprising and weakly hidden from the reader. The whole Teacher character and how his identity was kept from the reader -- when it would have obviuosly been revealed early on by a certain character he interacted with -- was ludicrous and unfortunately one of the main plot elements of the book. Many other of the plot devices were just as poorly handled. The payoff was totally retarded. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading and any time I actually got into the story some bad choice pulled me right back out of it."
1,Formulaic Fantasy From Brown,"Bottom line: If you have ever read any other Dan Brown novel then you're going to get through the first few chapters and suddenly feel an overwhelming sense of déjà vu. This is dime-store literature at it's best, or worst, depending on your preference. Definitely not worth all the hype.On the bright side, if you happen to love dime-store novels, and have never read any of his previous ""works,"" then you should be content curling up with this one. (I used the term ""works"" loosely, thus the quotes.)Brown novels are different settings, the same predictable ""surprise"" villains, and fashionable Hollywood thrills. Ad nauseam. Amazing that this book has garnered so much attention, but religion + conspiracy = controversy, which amounts to a ""bestseller"" even if the writing is sub par and cliché."
2,Really now!!,"This was a page turner, until almost the end, when it all fell into the totally same old same old. The narrow escapes, the graphic sex required, the beautiful super intelligent, super achiever heroine,paired with the handsom man to assist her, the sad, ugly badguy, the narrow escapes, etc,etc,etc.The last third of the book totally fell apart! I am a devout catholic, this book in no way under- mined my faith. I love bible and religious history. Some interesting premises here. Not really worth the time to read this book, though."
4,Good food for thought,"This is an exciting book. I read it in 2 days non-stop. Although some of the data are fictional, some are facts... so definitely a good food for thought."
3,the Shipping were little too slow,"Overall, the communication was very good, but only the shipping was a little too slow."
1,Too hyped,"Although it is an easy read, this book is over-hyped. The chapters are short, which is good...but the ending seems a little ""Scooby Doo"" to me."
3,Interesting and easy to read.,"This is one of those rare times when I truly did enjoy the movie more than reading the book. However, the book was a good read. The topic has much to do with the original popularity of the book in that some just can't separate fiction from reality, and the book does have everything going for it: an excellent story, good development, well thought out plot, not to mention how well the fiction weaves itself through elements of history. At no time did I consider not finishing the book, and, in fact, I looked forwarded to picking it up to continue."
2,The Da Vinci Code- audiobook,"I was surprised that the production of this audiobook was so bad, considering the mega-selling status of the book. Only one person does all of the voices, which wouldn't be too bad, but for the fact that the narrator's French accents are straight out of Pepe Le Peau and Inspector Closeau. The male voices are low and guttural and the ""female"" voices are high pitched and cartoonish. The result is unintentionally laughable. What were they thinking when they heard the playback? Although the plot and prose are rather contrived, it does make for a good listen on a long trip."
2,"Dry, boring, predictable if you've read any of his other novels.","The first Dan Brown book I read was Angels and Demons and I LOVED it! Every other book after that has been pretty much exactly the same thing. His plots pretty much don't change at all - only the setting and main characters. I've read all of his books so far (except the newest one The Lost Symbol) and I only really liked Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress.That being said, The Davinci Code was the most boring of all of his books so far. I only read it to see what everyone was so angry about. It sucked. Then they made it into a movie that sucked more than the book did.Very disappointing."
3,Good Thriller but incredibly stupid,"The Da Vinci Code is a really good thriller. The story moves quickly, the books a page turner and the descriptions are really good. In fact the way the book is written makes it feel like a movie, and like most movies The Da Vinci Code isn't without its flaws. Their were several parts of the book that made me roll my eyes at how cliche it got. I think the worst part was when Sophie sees something that was right in front of her face in a painting, but no one else was able to. Also the ending wasn't that great either but I won't spoil it. Its a good thriller but it lacks in plot."
2,"Mildly interesting , grossly stupid","A highly overrated book. The primise is kind of interesting if you toss reality to the winds, but this guy Brown couldn't create an interesting character if his life depended on it. Shallow, stupid dialogue, irrational actions, dopey scenarios (after a gut shot, chould the good perfesser do all that artwork?? C'mon...) make this a loser."
1,Novel as longwinded puzzle,"The author leverages an intriguing possibility about the life of Jesus and suffocates it under the flimsiest of characters, a thick layer of explication on the sacred feminine, two tons of cliches and a plot with timing so perfect that if the protagonist had stopped to take a pee, the entire novel would have collapsed. Somewhere around page 20 I numbly realized the author wasn't even trying to give each character his own dialogue; conversations only serve to drive the plot 80 miles an hour to the end of this longwinded puzzle. And that's all there is to the ""Code"": riddles and word games wrapped around a framework of a lite detective story. (I understand the author's next work involves the same code expert in ""Buddha Belly"", where clues written on fortune cookies point to evidence that the supposed-vegetarian Enlightened One had a weakness for barbecued goat ribs.)"
1,Displeased,"If you have a good education you will find it hard to ignore this authors continuous factual mistakes. If I am too harsh, I can only say that I am not used to reading such poorly researched text. The fact that so many people find it so well researched makes me wonder about the sorry state of education in our country.I am on page 217 so far, and I am still trying to push my way though it. It is not easy, for it is also not terribly interesting.And the Silas character, what is he he supposed to be? , some kind of Catholic secret agent with a license to kill?Please. This book so far feels like a waste of time."
2,unfortunately disappointing...,"I was very excited to read this book, given the hype about it. I have my own ideas of faith/God, but I thought the premise was very interesting and I had an open mind going into it. However, as another reader said, the plot lost steam about halfway through, and I had to make myself finish the book. I got to about 10 pages from the end and put it down because it was just taking so LONG! Those last 10 pages were somewhat interesting, but like the rest of the plot, it was just too conveniently wrapped up. Plot was thin, characters were thin, denoument of the plot was long and drawn out.It's amazing what an author's agent/publisher can do to promote such a mediocre book."
2,davinci goofiness,If this is an example of a good triller or good fiction I am surprised. Although the premise could be interesting the constant chase and riddles detracted from the possible intiguing story that would change history! Don't waste your time on this one
4,fun fun fun!,I rather liked the book. I read it in one night. night/morning. But the ending was rather...cliche or used too often. the ending is very corny and trashy. i don't like it at all. but the plot was pretty good and fast paced.
1,Violates The Entire Geneva Convention,"Torture, plain & simple. Inhuman, unholy, horrific torture. This is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to lay across my eyes. As I writer I have personally made my publisher vow on the souls of his children to place a pistol between my eyes and shoot me at point blank range should I ever ever create something as monstrous as this ""novel"". The writing is over-the-top melodrama, the plot unbelievably ridiculous. I wanted to tear my eyes out of their sockets to relieve them of the cruelty I subjected them to by forcing them to look upon and process this pile of dingo dung. For the love of all that is holy, stay away from this book. You'll thank me for not reading it, I promise you. Oh! The humanity!"
2,Don't buy it!,"If anyone believes that what they're reading in this book is truth, I would ask you to contact me, as I have some great swamp land in Arizona for sale. Virtually everything that Dan Brown claims is ""factual"" is so wrong it's ludicrous, and what he actually gets right you would have to say, ""So what?"" Read it as pure fiction, and it's merely in bad taste. Read it as ""truth"" and you've been conned by a great con artist who couldn't take the time to check his historical facts to see if they were actually true. The story is okay, but it is one long chase scene, and Dan Brown is clearly no Robert Ludlum. This book is great for those who like to be duped. If you'd prefer to read historical novels that are faithful to historical facts, pick up a book by Paul L. Maier. They are excellent! Forget this book. You can do better."
2,Just what I thought,"After reading Angels and Demons I didn't rush into this book, and my reservations (and myriad bad reviews) were borne out."
3,Overated!,"Weak sequel to Angels and Demons. I thought A&D; was much better than this one and I think Dan Brown tried to do a follow up to A&D; with a different premise, but the plot is pretty much the same: a treasure hunt from city to city.I believe this one was overhyped because of it's premise, lucky Dan Brown. Otherwise it would be a very ho-hum book, not even as good as some of his early ones.The bad thing about it is it's spawned a whole bunch of copycats and accessory books, the authors of which should all send in 50% of their paycheck to Dan Brown since he's singlehandly responsible for it. And it's bad because none of them are any good, none that I've read anyway.If you've just woken up in a cave, don't buy this book, get it from the library. If you have this book, donate it to the library so Dan Brown and the publishers won't make any more money. We don't want to reward him and have more bad books written."
2,Too many twists and turns,Since this book was displayed everywhere and such a hot topic--I just had to read it. Towards the end it was utterly painful-I was wore out with all the twists and turns. Sophie and Langdonalways managed to escape just at the very last minute. Awe come on it's just not possible.I kept reading this book because Iwanted to find out who THE TEACHER was--it was never revealedand this is unforgivable.The idea that Jesus may have had analternate life is very interesting and something to ponder butplease do a better job of writing the novel!
2,Hate God? You'll love this book!,"This is a fairly well thought out thriller, but it becomes apparent soon enough that the main thrust of this book is that The Bible is not the word of God, but just a collection of fiction.There are plenty of good books that don't make a Christian feel dirty reading them. This one is a waste of time."
4,Jesus was of the Royal House of David,"In reply to 'A reader from St. Louis MO United States '- Even if you do not except that Jesus was the Son of God- he was of the house of David (KING david) and therefore of a ""Royal"" lineage"
1,This is a best seller?,"I haven't read Dan Brown before, suspecting that there was little substance vs. style in his writing. However, after seeing this book on the best seller list for so long I gave it a try. Darn it, I was right the first time. As I read, three issues stood out. First, all the research could have been done in two days on the internet. If the author spent more than that, it was not apparent. Second, character development was cartoonish at best. You could not feel sympathetic or engaged in these shades. A cryptologist who can't recognize an anagram? Bah! And finally plot development,as if you could find it. This book is similar to so many others that believe that excessive description will make up for a lame plot with overworked and trite devices. No doubt, Mr. Brown will make more money in the future, try not to let it be yours."
3,the da vinci code,This was very predictable. Over hyped. It was a good quick read. Nothing to get excited about. Might make a better movie. Written like it was meant to be one. Not great not bad. enjoy.
1,aka Foucault's Pendulum for Dummies,"I have to admit I'm biased, Umberto Eco being one of my favorite living authors, but The Da Vinci Code is just a pale imitation of Eco's sublime and meticulous work. The prose is excruciating the plot transparent and the characters are pure cliches. The random historical facts Brown throws in come across as smug and extraneous; he reminds me of that one kid in every class who thinks his constant off-topic comments impress the professor. Please please turn back now and buy Foucault's Pendulum instead."
3,"Good start, mediocre finish","I really liked the start of the book with a lot of historical detail and intrigue about real organizations. As the book goes on, however, it gets more and more trite and predictable. The characters are not very well developed and you don't really care about them. It turns out more like a soap opera than a really good book. It is very readable, however."
2,Good at first then....,"When the book begins, it definitely hooks you in with its creative storyline, promises of secrets, conspiracy theories, etc.; however once the main characters leave Paris, the story becomes absurd. As many other reviewers have said, the dialogue is horrible and ineloquent, the chapters are left with ""cliffhangers"" that are honestly really lame, and the lead character seems to know EVERYTHING. I mean, can he be stumped for more than 5 seconds? It gets so ridiculous. I'm not going to reveal the ending, but the longer the book progresses, the worse it gets. If you want a quick read with no pre-requisite for thinking, borrow it from the library."
2,mediocre page turner,"Yeah, this book keeps you going, and it's probably great for a long plane ride, but my god, do a better job with the writing and the characters! These characters are supposed to be solving the 'greatest secret of all time' and yet they are completely clueless. Some of the least imaginative writing to make the best seller lists. And just for perspective, I am not Christian and have no opinion on either side of the Jesus/Mary Magdalene debate. If you like conspiracy theories and secret societies, go read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum. Now THERE is a book!"
3,Save your money for a better book,"About half-way through this book I began to regret the purchase. Dan Brown is overcome by his 'research' and the story never really gels. When an untrained person like me can decipher the anagrams faster than the characters who are experts, there is something very wrong. Brown doesn't sell the romance angle at all. Finally, he tries to un-do his shots at The Vatican and The Priory with a few apologetic sentences toward the end. With all the hokey rose symbolism rampant throughout the book, I felt surely the culprit would turn out to be Pete Rose."
5,"Great Book, But Don't Believe Everything You Read","I loved this book and, like many people, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading it. It is a thoughtful, well written, intelligently constructed novel. Dan Brown is either a genius, or had a great deal of help constructing the cryptography of this book. To those who view it with religious disdain I say this: It is a work of fiction and you know it. To create this world, Dan Brown has included some not quite truths that work with the internal logic of the story. That is fine, we expect that of an author. To those who disbelieve him, I say this: It is possible. Highly bloody unlikely, but possible. This is an incredible book-read it and judge it on its merits, but do not judge it without reading it."
2,"provocative ideas, shallow characters","Robert Langdon is a bookish Harvard professor who needs a holiday. The symbologist is then drawn into the an implausible mystery involving the holy grail. The existence of the Priory of Scion, Jesus's marriage to Mary Magdalene or the arbitrary decisions at the Council of Nicea raises interesting quetions about the the church. One would expect that a scholar would be revealed to show more reflection and background on these topics. But his character, like Sophie's, is intended to be more visual. Rather than having read the book, I could have waited for the movie."
4,A quick read that encourages further discussion,"While this book does read like a screenplay, I still found it intriguing, entertaining and apparently very well researched. It moves along quite rapidly and creates enough suspense to make the read worth it. Some of the scenes were over the top, but it's still a good book.One positive aspect of the book is that those who read it are actually looking into the many premises offered up by Mr. Brown. Whether reading other books on the subject, researching on-line, or just talking with others, people are actually using their heads. In my book, anything that encourages learning is a good thing!"
2,Too Clever by Half,"This very popular book uses alternative ideas of the history of Christianity as the basis for the plot. The author has taken a large number of crackpot ideas about the history of Christianity and European history in general and stitched them together to produce a conventional thriller. In general, all these ideas center around the common theme of a hidden or secret history of Christianity suppressed by the Church. The plot elements are cleverly integrated using a series of puzzles. The overall story is cast as a kind of Grail legend with virtuous knight (a la Parsifal) and an evil sorcerer type (a la Klingsor). The quality of writing, however, is poor. The characters are schematic and exist only as devices to move from one gimmick to another. The action of the plot per se is rather silly. Not recommended, even for light reading."
2,Way too much hype for this book.,"After hearing a lot of great reviews for this book, I was excited to read something ""fascinating"" and ""fast-paced"". Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to the hype. I am a voracious reader, but this book took me three weeks to finish--I kept putting it down and reading other novels. I found this book slow, far-fetched (not the premise, but the massive scavenger hunt by two normal people), and predictable. The author's use of the term ""sacred feminine"" every ten pages or so was irritating. I did not find the book upsetting nor enlightening. I don't understand the uproar made by some people, its a work of fiction, and not very good fiction at that. I probably won't watch the movie since the author has said it's just like the book."
1,completely historically inaccurate,"The book is mildly entertaining, but readers beware of the gross historical inaccuracies littered throughout the book. Brown's sources have no credentials for the field in which they write, and his fanciful ideas are merely for entertainment purposes. If you want to know more about the historical falsities, check out this website: http://answers.org/issues/davincicode.html"
3,Plot can be found in previously published books,"If you have read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL (1983) or similar books you may find this story entirely too predictable to enjoy. The central plot twists are based on traditions, speculations and legends previously published in other books. If you are not at all familiar with these theories you will probably enjoy the story. Whether you believe them or not the theories are interesting enough to carry the plot."
3,It's a novel,"I read this novel when it was first published (back in 2003). It's a good novel without being a great novel, it raises some interesting possibilities and has introduced me to one of my favourite villains of all time.I recommend this novel to anyone who likes plausible possibility but who can differentiate fiction from fact. If religious themes offend, then read Brown's other thrillers instead.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,Da Vinci Code and Esau Swindle 2 Great Thrillers,"I was just sent a copy of this book by a friend of mine who highly recommended it: The Esau Swindle, by Gerald Rothberg. Book about a New York art dealer that gets caught up in the shady dealings of his twin brother in Argentina. Couldn't put it down!! Great stocking stuffer for thriller fans. I went through the whole thing in 48 hours, while recovering from T-day. If I were fifteen years older, the lead would make a great movie part for me. This would have been great for Harrison Ford during his Patriot Games years. Also recommended: The Esau Swindle, Da Vinci Code"
4,Not the best but worth reading,"It seems most people love it or hate it, but I would say it's somewhere in between. The novel is a great thriller and kept me reading on, particularly for a good handful of riddles to keep us thinking. The highly-researched mystery of the Grail is a good introduction to people less familiar with the historical theories on early Christianity and even leaves a good start for how to do more research on the subject.Certainly, it is not flawlessly written- Dan Brown insists on repeating information rather than trusting the reader to catch everything the first time and is unfortunately fond of cliches. Still, the fast pace and intriguing treasure hunt made up for it all."
1,"As an atheist, I'm deeply offended by Dan Brown's prose.","This book is every bit as awful as its most perceptive critics say. The prose reads as if extracted from a trash compactor in which an average thriller, a volume of pseudo-intellectual art history and a tourist guidebook to Paris and London have been mashed together. This is the 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' of 'intellectual' thrillers. All those millions who bought this book must be reading for laughs."""
3,Enjoyable.. if light,"What to say? and Where to begin?First of all I foung 'The DaVinci Code"" to be very entertaining. It is a fast paced thriller with lots of action, intrigue and puzzles. Yes it's lightweight stuff, and Brown isn't the most talented writer, but it's fun.Having already read 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' some years ago, I was familiar with the main plot revelations already- but even so Brown kept me intrigued the whole way through.What it is not, is an accurate representation of history. And Brown's New-Agism had me rolling my eyes a lot. Although having said that I didn't find it to be as anti- Catholic as some have made out."
3,Entertaining but ultimately pretty dumb,"This was an entertaining book for certain. It was a page turner that kept me up late a couple times and I enjoyed reading it. However, the book is not as clever as it thinks it is. I found that the puzzles in the book were easy to solve, for everyone except the characters. In a couple instances I knew the solution to the current problem facing our heroes several pages before they figured it out. And I am not the kind of person who solves the mystery before the movie ends if you know what I mean. This would probably be a nice read for a young teenager."
4,the da vinci code,I thought that the story started out slow but got moving along very quickly and found I coundn't put the book down.
2,A surprising read,The DaVinci Code is a fairly good thriller but it is astonishingly similar to one I read not long ago titled Daughter of God. I suppose great minds think alike. . .
4,Fun and Interesting,"I found this to be a good book and while I have not changed my views on the interpretation of catholicism, history or christianity, it sparked some questions and made for some interesting conversations. The quest for the Holy Grail in this book was intriguing to read.Any book that inspires me to do a little research online is well worth the time to me."
2,"Fun, but ...","Rip-roaring good read for the beach or any particularly brainless day. It's entertaining, but the characters are cardboard, the history and ""facts"" utter crap, and - the worst sin of all - I consistently figured out the next ""twist"" in the mystery long before the characters did, which made for a lot of impatient waiting for the characters to get around to figuring things out. Nothing worse than an utterly predictably plot ""twist."" (Also, do these people never sleep? Maybe that's why they're so dumb ... they run for like five days with no discernable breaks and a bizarrely distorted time-scale.)Enjoyed it, but don't particularly reccommend it. And keep it away from any historians, theologians, or art scholars you know - it'll only make them crazy with all its invented facts."
2,Conned again!,"Okay, I admit I read it in one sitting but please be aware that this book is the literary equivalent of Lethal Weapon 4. Lots of mindless action, stilted dialogue, naive cultural viewpoints, and an ending that leaves you rather embarrassed that you read the book.And of course be sure to use Google to find the historical inaccuracies and author indulgences."
1,Tripe,"A contrived story with weak characterization and laughable plot, salted with a number of pseudo historical factoids. For a much better novel with a similar theme may I recommend Wilton Barnhardt's ""Gospel"". If you are really serious and want to enjoy the prose of a true poet and classisist; look for and find the long out of print novel by Robert Graves, ""King Jesus""."
2,Mostly interesting material poorly written.,"After a short honeymoon with this book where I was smitten by the unrelenting presentation of interesting facts and information in a midly entertaining fashion, I became increasingly irritated. Within 5 chapters I could predict the structure and conclusion of every subsequent chapter. The shameless manipulation of narrative to allow for more of the author's ideas to be disseminated became more and more transparent. While not as badly written or as execrable as the Celestine Prophecies of some years ago, Da Vinci shares the same basic problem which is that underneath it all, it is a mediocre book with a host of interesting ideas. On top of that is the problem that some of the ideas are whoppingly spurious. See other critics for some glaring examples. The list is too long for a short commentary.On the other hand I read it in one day and it was an effortless read. And that seems to be the current qualification for greatness these days."
2,Da Vinci Code warning label,"I enjoy well written novels. This one was well written for the first 100+ pages. But faltered with the action and chase scenarios. When the plot was developed I found myself not caring about it and lost the interest I had developed in the early stages of the novel.A word of warning: the book should be previewed before purchase. I would recommend reading pages 119-121, 124-126, and pages 231-233 to see if you are comfortable with the author's theme. For those who are not, it would be a waste to purchase this book."
1,Cheesy Farce Fiction,"When I first picked up The DaVinci Code, I'll admit I was curious. Almost immediately the reader is catapulted into an intense Parisian murder scene at the Louvre. I was into it, really into it, I actually devoted up to six hours of a saturday to read this book. However, I found myself shaking my head more and more saying, ""no, this is ridiculous."" And then there just came a point when I said no to the whole idea of it. The distortion of facts about DaVinci and his paintings is just TOO much. Not only does the book become a complete farce, but the writing deteriorates at a rapid pace as well. The whole thriller starts unraveling with laughable coincidence that springs up from places where you would most obviously expect.The person I really felt bad for after putting this book down was the man who had been defamed with no way to save himself, that would be Leonardo DaVinci. Readers would be wiser to pick up an actual art history book that truthfully follows this master painter."
4,heresy schmeresy,"I'm halfway through this and having a grand time. Dan Brown is HARDLY the first one to come up with the idea that Christ fathered a child. If you want stupid religious ... read The Omega Code.The Da Vinci Code is fun, it is full of good tidbits and trivia, it's reasonably well written (the exceptions being some obvious ploys in the plot in order to be able to explain history).It's hard to put down and a quick read. If you like cryptography or fast-paced diversion it will entertain you."
5,What a Difference!,"I first read the original Da Vinci Code some years ago, and loved it. However, I found myself having to stop reading to go on the i-net and look up the paintings and structures that were featured in the story. When someone told me they had an illustrated version, I was ecstatic. I re-read the book, and must say that it is an entirely different experience (and adventure!) reading this. If you loved the Da Vinci Code there's no way you'll dislike the illustrated version.Additionally, Amazon sells it MUCH cheaper than retail book stores!"
4,Love it or hate it,"Love it.I recommend the illustrated version, the art and photographs will bring the reader right to the action, it's like a vacation to France. In my biased opinion, this book is quite fantastic on a literary level, with my only complaint being that it's slightly graphic. However, Dan Brown certainly did his research and brought the controversial Holy grail arguement to life in a most entertaining thriller.I certainly will not bother to state my opinions on religious matters on the book as it would take far too much time here (and I am far too lazy). However I think despite its controversy most readers will enjoy the Code for its interesting tidbits, such as the fibonacci sequences & PHI (CRAZY no?), anagrams & symbology, and references to Da Vinci's paintings. Don't bother to watch the movie, read the book."
3,Historical Fiction?,"I have to admit that I really enjoyed The Da Vinci Code. It was a page turner. I was impressed by Mr. Brown's interweaving of facts and fiction... but it got to a point that I am concerned many people are forgetting that it is a fictional novel! Many people are using it a historical research, which it is not. Although it does bring to public attention some issues of Church history that will be new to many. A good read, if you keep your eye on the main point... this is intended to be an enjoyable novel (not a research paper). Enjoy!P.S. I enjoyed this much more than Angels & Demons, which was much more violent and had way too much blantant foreshadowing."
1,A lie,"Everyting the author says about Opus Dei is a lie. If he doesn't know the Opus Dei is not because it's secret. There are more than 80.000 members around the world. I'm a member. If someone is interested about Opus Dei, please mail me. There are thousands of books, articles, and websites about Opus Dei. Just type Opus Dei in google. Nothing about pictures. Best"
3,Disappointing,"I received this as a Christmas Gift. Like other reviewers here, I began investigating some of Mr. Brown's suppositions. That is exactly what they were. Although there is a measure of truth in the fact that these secret societies existed, there is no evidence of the suppositions he makes beyond that. In fact, his 'research' is text from other books. It is a good thing that the book is listed as ""ficition""."
4,IM VERY MAD (though not about the book),"I just wrote a very in-depth review of the book, and my computer deleted it when i previewed it (and by the way, im not incompetent when it comes to computers). Anyway, i'll sum up what i said in one sentence: The book was good, considering i don't tend to like mystery thrillers, though i was annoyed at the astounding assumptions and conclusions made by Langdon and Sophie, which tended to make the book somewhat unrealistic and idealistic."
2,As long as your dont stop to think,"A few thousand year old mystery kept secret is solved in just a few hours by the protaganists. I tried hard, really hard to enjoy this book but it is too light a book.Read the ""Quincunx"" instead."
1,The Biggest Mystery ...,".... Is how this book got on the best-seller list. The writing is wooden, the characters one-dimensional, the dialogue unspeakable. If you like expository writing, The Da Vinci Code is for you -- the characters talk like textbooks. A major theme is that the Grail is not a literal cup but an embodiment of feminine power, but Brown misses an anagram for ""grail"" -- ""a girl""!"
5,"Excellent - Intelligent, refreshing & unpredictable.","This was just a great book. I have seen it on the BestSeller list since the dawning of time so for my latest trip, I made this my book of choice.I began it Thursday evening and had it finished by Sunday. I just could not put it down. The theories were so refreshing and new, every page brought a new surprise, the story flowed so well. My only disappointment was that I finished the book and no longer can look at it with new eyes, and read the story for the first time.Just a great, great book. There was only one aspect that I predicted correctly. Everything else was a surprise (and an education).Don't miss out on this book!!!!"
1,There's no mystery in this mystery!,"What on earth are the critics raving about? Two-thirds of the book is copped directly from the references the author gives beginning Chapter 60. The other one-third is a weak attempt to merge mystery religion with what the author believes is a thriller. Anyone who has read even one of the four historical studies cited by the author knows all about Da Vinci's so-called checkered activities and his flakey antics such as backward writing and cryptograms. And to call the main character Sauniere is just ribald cartooning!So, Mister Brown, I guess I missed something... In your opinion, what did happen to John the Baptizer?"
4,"Interesting ideas, mediocre thriller","The book served as an introduction, at least for me (and I am not very knowledgeable in this area, to the world of 'alternative' religion. I don't know how much of what was told in this book resembles any degree of truth. But it makes you wanting to read more on this subject. That's what I first started to do upon completion of this novel. And it's great achievment of the author. At the same time, I found it to be quite lame thriller, contrary to many reviews. The plot lines are predictable in many cases. In addition, Dan Brown is not a very good writer. His style is somewaht 'wooden' (as was mentioned in one of the reviews of this book). And what about all this itallics - I found such widespread use of itallics very annoying. That's why I gave it four stars. This book has a very interesting content, which is delivered in imperfect way."
3,Da Vinci Code,"Dan Brown has written an excellent book. His research is extremely well done. However, the book tries, but does not, engage the well educated reader. If one knows the history and the mythology surrounding the Medieval Templars and the Grail story, one is disappointed by the outcome of the book. Otherwise, the book is well written and exciting. There are a few things the book lacks but it is worth a read. He could have carried some of his research into ancient Near Eastern history and archaeology and built a stronger foundation for his premise."
1,utter nonsense,I understand that William Goldman is writing the screenplay for the movie adaptation of this silly novel. Maybe he can turn it into something that will work on screen. As a novel it is pure pulp.
2,What's the Fuss?,"Yes, the storytelling and character development are pedestrian at best, but it seems that those who decry the 'facts' in the book the loudest are those who fear that they may actually be true."
3,Mithra-nthrope,"Fun, fast facts about intriguing subjects (templars, paganism, big, bad catholic church, big, bad men...) I thought it would make a good afternoon movie for Lifetime for Women channel. However, bad characterizations, flimsy plotlines, and that oh so condescending ""all scholars agree that Christ wasn't God and Da Vinci and Newton were Goat-head wearing fertility god and goddess worshipers... like me!"" comments denigrated from the story. Umberto Echo in ""Foucalt's Pendelum"" handled the tangled web and intentional ambiguity of early Christian/Mason/Templar symbology and mythology better than this book. My deep despair is in the book reviews written here by readers who take it all as unambiguous fact and state ""I never knew that Christianity was nothing more than just a corruption of the TRUE naturalistic religions of Sex worshipping Pagans. I'll just grab the kids and join the local Wicca coven. Hope they have a Sunday School for Junior!"""
5,A Fantastic Trip,Dan Brown has written the best mystery/thriller I've read in years. As we follow Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon on his journey beginning at the Louvre with a mysterious death. His need to solve the crime takes us on a fabulous journey through historical places and works of art. The fantastic research of the author reinforces the plot and keeps book's pages turning.
5,absolutely the best,"had given up hope. thought all mysteries had turned into ""cozies"". Great research, good characters and takes more than an hour to read. Also recommend ""Shutter Island"". Two in one week, incredible!!"
4,Good read but what a load,"This is a good mystery with puzzles to solve, historical sights, interesting happenings and escapes, but flimsy in its basis. Enjoyed it but couldn't take it seriously at all, almost laughable. But you might like it."
1,"derivative, unoriginal & boring",If you are in any way familiar with anything to do with the templars then you know 90% familiar with everything this book has to offer by way of plot. There is no character development of any sort. Not even a good summer read; give it a miss.
2,Entertaining tale; inaccurate background research,"This is an entertaining tale, but to call it a historical novel is an egregious misnomer. His representation of historical ""facts"" pertaining to the Knights Templar and the allusions to the Rosecrucians are inaccurate at best, and irresponsible in any event. Cutting to the chase, everything else not withstanding, even if Jesus and Mary Magdalene had married and produced a ""royal bloodlike,"" the Passion, Crucifixion, and Resurrection still stand on their own right. In other words, ""What difference does could of this make in relation to one's faith and one's perception of Christianity?"" The only difference is much padding to Mr. Brown's bank account. Greed, irresponsibility, and poor research in the guise of ""Controversial Best Seller."""
1,Novel,"As another commentator already wrote, please don't take this book so seriously. The author himself asserts it is fiction. It's a novel, enjoy it if you fancy such tortious prose but don't swallow it all & confuse fact with fiction. Too many people believe everything they read in the papers: it will serve the general population much better if we be more discerning readers!"
1,bottom of the barrel,"Lame, clunky, corny, simple, pedestrian, silly, contrived, wooden and that's just the dialogue folks!Don't even get me started on the dopey plot.A truly miserable effort, but hey Brown is crying all the way to the bank."
1,"Drivel, pure drivel","Drivel, pure drivel. Here's a tip, if you are setting out to write a fast paced caper where the charcters must solve coded messages to advance the story, the ""codes"" should be more complex than those found in the ""jumble"" in the newspaper or ""mirror writing"" used in my son's weekly reader. I solved the three main codes in less than a minute each, but our expert cryptologist and religious symbolist aggonized over them for several pages. Also, the author is oblivious to the facts and folklore that provide the backdrop of his book. As just one example, the Holy Grail derived from an earlier pagan legend about a magic cauldron, not the idea suggested by the author. This is the worst book I have read in ages. If you want a good novel about the theft of a sacred relic and the follower's pursuant to retrieve the relic, try Wilkie Collin's ""The Moonstone"""
3,mmm,"Overall, I found this book to be extremely cheesy. But there were interesting ideas. The times set aside for holidays were chosen based on existing pagan holidays. Romanesque churches still standing today are believed by some scholars to be the work of rural pagan craftsmen who put sly references to their belief of male/female equality and such.Oh! And this document concerning PS leadership includes French film maker Jean Cocteau."
4,"People May Love or Hate the Fictional Narrative, But...","The research is astoundingly thorough. You'll learn things about Catholicism, Paganism, the Bible and more that you've probably never heard.The ""shock"" here is that the story of Christ is not exactly as it was laid out in the bible. To some of us, that's not exactly a shock, but those more orthodox who interpret the Bible literally--this book must seem like the biggest heresy of all.But the history is dead-on, and you're going to be surprised at how what you've been told for so long is not factually correct. Even more cynical is why it came to be that way (although predictable).Definitely worth reading. A quick read, too."
3,Catholic Church--ticked off,"I love books that tick off the Catholic Church. The Da Vinci Code is definitely one of them. If you like books like this one, try CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL to get the inside scoop on the ""dirt of the church.""Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"
4,"Exciting fictional story, not based on history","""The Da Vinci Code"" is a very intriguing, exciting, suspensful murder mystery full of secret codes and messages, a definite challenge to the reader to figure it all out before the main characters do. The book is full of subtle hints, and plenty of surprises too.Some have criticized the historical setting--assumptions about biblical history, contrary (even heretical) to orthodox Christian theology, and not supported by artifacts or ancient documents (and verify any ""facts"" laid out--like purported origins of words--through other means, as with any work of fiction!). But if one remembers that it's only fiction, one can have fun on this ride, and pretend with the author for the duration of the book, just as we pretend for a while that archeology professors transport themselves using whips and shoot at Nazis and just have fun watching the movie."
2,ludicrous,"Don't believe the hype. This is a poorly written book peopled by unlikely non-characters who don't so much interact as impart (or ask for) information (or disinformation), while chasing after one another at breakneck speeds or making hairbreadth escapes. If you can stomache sentences like the following - ""Everyone in the emergency room gasped at the sight of the half-naked albino offering the bleeding clergyman"" - then be my guest. You have been warned."
1,Save Your Money,"Much as been written and television has added to this, so I won't produce any long diatribe. Basically it is not a very good book. It certainly must have an excellent advertising agency behind it to produce all this media attention and indeed is undoubtedly making this author quite pleased with himself and well-off financially.The premise is an interesting one to fictionally exploit. Why not? It's only purports to be a mass-market thriller, not a theological treatise. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly organized, and doesn't provoke much in the way of interesting speculations. As an historian, I find several mistakes only due to poor research, albeit these could be overlooked for the sake of plot - if one could find a truly enticing plot to follow.There are some remarkably excellent fiction authors currently producing works that can be educational and thoughtful and, at the same time, just plain fun for a light read. Save your money on this one."
2,Much ado about nothing...,"It's hard to believe this book has generated so much hype. Brown is nothing much more than a Robert Ludlum wannabe; to call him a pale imitation is too charitable.The book's improbable and (rather) abrupt denouement makes one wonder whether Brown suddenly exhausted his store of tiresome plot twists or, alternatively, his publisher simply (and mercifully) placed a hard ceiling on his page allotment. Either way, the result is unsatisfying. While Ludlum is no Graham Greene (or even a John Le Carre), he certainly does this kind of thing much better than Brown.Brown's numerous historical canards have been well-documented elsewhere and serve only to further undermine this puerile effort. And to think ""writers"" like Brown are the modern torchbearers of a Western popular culture that once included such giants as Dickens...."
2,The Da Vinci Code,"Really fast read. Great airport book. Pick it up, get interested, and have something to read for the next couple of hours. But it's full of NOTHING. There area few tid bits that are fun food for thought, but even those are run over an over and over again like a bad joke. The two main characters are experts on symbols and codes...but you wouldn't know it unless you had been told. Every other line is ""It was so easy, I should have seen it before!"" Then the bad guy...it sounds like Dan couldn't figure out who he wanted for the bad guy until he was forced to show him. Awful. Most of the book was sitting and listening to information. Lecture lecture lecture. RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS. Lecture lecture lecture. RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS. Lecture lecture lecture. And most every chapter ended like this...""It's time I tell you the trueth."" Then you would have to wait four chapters to find out. That's how Dan infuses a book with suspense that wouldn't normaly have any."
1,Inaccurate and Not Well Written,"This book is better than Angels and Demons, but still a highly flawed work. The Da Vinci Code suffers from heavy handed foreshadowing, contrived conveniences, cardboard characters, bad pacing and (again--just like in Angels and Demons) incorrect facts which skew history, ignore the laws of physics, and force the reader to suspend disbelief past the point of acceptability.Most scary (and the reason for 1 star rather than 2 or 3) are the large numbers of readers who believe EVERY word that Dan Brown writes and quote the book like it's a non-fiction work. Read it if you must, but remember that it's fiction...."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I waited and waited for the greatness and finally for the great finish and I was disappointed.Kind of formulaic, touching on concepts and objects that fascinate many to gain readers interest."
3,good read but not great,"Fundamentalists should consider other reading material but you have to give kudos to the author for making theological discussions such a hot topic. A very interesting premise which involves the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar and the Priory Of Sion. Brown beautifully interweaves fact and fiction concerning these fascinating subjects and prodded me to read related works. Now onto the problems I had with this novel: annoying references to previous novel (the Vatican incident); too many of the scenes are just outright unbelieveable and the inclusion of hollywood blockbuster action scenes forces the reader to question whether Brown was counting on a movie deal as he wrote; major reasoning flaws scattered throughout the second half of the novel (to name just one, a mirror image that the most brillant code detecting minds couldn't figure out? come on); and lastly, the totally smarmy ending tempted me to scream. Overall, an entertaining read."
1,Not Worth The Time,"This novel has no memorable characters, none that I care about. It reads like an adult Nancy Drew mystery, and in the end, is little more than a boring entertainment. Dan Brown should take lessons from Ken Follett on how to write an engaging suspense novel.What confounds me is the public interest in the novel. Thee must be 10,000 midlist novels that tell a better story, books written by authors who can't afford to quit their day jobs. It's all very depressing. If the average I.Q. in the USA is 100, that means 50% of the population has an I.Q. below average. Perhaps in the end, that is the answer."
5,A Wonderful Thrill Ride,"With all the hoopla, and religious concerns aside, the Da Vinci Code is a wonderfully well-written book. The characters are complex, the action continuous, and the plot credible. If the book is lacking anything, its that I wish it had been longer. I understand there were sections left out when the book was edited. I'd like to see a second printing which include some of those sections. You are enticed through the story by a series of clues which demonstrates the truly creative mind of Dan Brown."
2,Free Falling,"I began reading The Da Vinci Code with the idea that it was a superb book, due to the comments of several co-workers. The book, it seemed at first, was very good. It was riveting and exciting, with so many questions to answer that I couldn't put it down. Even the religious theories were very compelling. However, it soon came to a sudden stop. Dan Brown, in an attempt to keep things interesting while exerting as little effort as possible, starts to flail around blindly in his attempts to further unfold his theories. If this were not enough, he causes his characters to take a disappointing dive into the depths of stupidity, having them stumped by amateur riddles and kindergarten clues in an attempt to drag out his nonsense. The book is then wrapped up in a ""ha ha! tricked you"" manner that did not appease my anger at having wasted my time. The book, on the whole, reminded me of the stories that I used to write in middle school...which is very sad."
4,"Wow, get's the wheels turning...........","Great story, very entertaining. I could not put this book down, it really sucks you in till the end."
3,The Debt to Umberto Eco,"Dan Brown must admire Umberto Eco. A lot. Museums late at night, Knights Templar, the ""Secret"", the professor pulled into a mystery wrapped in an enigma, a secretive Catholic society. Umberto did it better. But Dan's book is OK, however the prose is, um, easy to read. It read more like a move script outline to me than a book. He also presents LOTS of speculation as fact but that is the fun part - are these speculations in fact true? Are the Freemasons protecting a secret the Knights discovered while they drive around in gocarts wearing fez hats at a 4th of July parade? Or just hooey? Read Eco's Foucalt's Pendulum and really delve into multiple, head-spinning conspiracies head first. Conspiracies that dry up when discovered because of the twisted logic of the believers. (I'll reveal no more.) It has a much creepier atmosphere and writing that will make you smile."
4,"Great Premise, weak characters","I had heard of all the hype about the Da Vinci Code, and finally, out of curiosity, I picked up a copy. And I was immediately drawn in.the Da Vinci Code is a fast paced intricate novel of secrets. The plot is well-researched and well-written. What I did not like about the book was the poor character development. Langdon and Co. were there only as plot pushers. The main story was the Grail. I felt that when the story was over and done we didn't know any more about Langdon than when we first started. He only sprouts information at the right moments, as with Sophie Neveu. They seemed to know everything under the sun about symbols and codes, and yet we didn't know anything more about them.However, the premise was good, and that is why I give this book 4 stars."
4,verty interesting,This book is a must read for anyone that reads the Bible or whatever inspirational book your reading. It made me want to research even more about the historical Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. Its a great book that keep you guessing until the end. Great book!!
2,Good story but it carries too much personal baggage,"This story has a great premise and is well written. Unfortunately the author uses the story as a vehicle for expressing strong anti-Christian views. While the story is fiction, its clear that the author's distaste for Christianity is very real."
4,"Unputdownable story, less than average literature","The story, characters, events and twists are tailormade for Hollywood, and I could not (literally) put the book down. But I won't call this ""true"" literature! It was more like reading the script for a movie; engrossing though it may, the reader still feels like ""reading a movie"" instead of reading literature."
4,Good Drama and an Interesting Hypothesis,"A very enjoyable read.Well written. Brown presents an engaging murder-mystery plot with interesting characters, intriguing puzzles and solid historical references. His research of the relevant history and locations really shows and lends great depth to the storyHighly recommended"
2,The Da Vinci Load of ....,"If you are buying this nonsense, get a clue. Familiarize yourself with Leonardo's work. Check out his other portrait of St. John. The likeness is painted just as effeminate as in the Last Supper. Brown is yankin' the collective chain and getting quite rich doing it. Hopefully his next book will be entitled ""How to Get Rich Appealing to the Gulliblility of the Public."" Or There is Indeed a Sucker Born Every Minute.""I give this one 2 stars for Brown's mercenary genius. As for his writing skill, I think I'll stick with the Bobsey Twins."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Amazon chose to ignore my earlier review, but buyers/readers still need warning. This is a badly crafted, poorly written book. However, if you must read it to see what all the fuss is about, lower you expectations to rock bottom. Then ask yourself, how do these things get on the bestseller lists anyway?"
1,"Interesting subject, weak writing","This book is to Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" as a microwaved corn dog is to a five course meal with matched wines.The corn dog's quicker, but you'll enjoy the meal more.Hack-iest writing device: I counted at least FIVE CHAPTERS that ended with ""...and (so-and-so) was so amazed, they couldn't begin to believe what they saw."""
1,Shocking!,"I read this book when I was traveling in Poland and couldn't find anything in English to read. I wanted to put it down after the first chapter but I lacked anything else to read so I forced myself to finish it although it became more unbearable after every page. Even the cliffhangers were so pathetic as to be laughable. I felt as if I were reading a rejected script for a bad B movie.What is most disturbing about this book is not the faulty, silly and completely unhistoric background but the terrible writing. I should have figured it couldn't be so well written to sell that many copies, but I didn't expect such cliched situations, such empty, flat characters. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's really sad to see something this poor being read by millions of people :("
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK,I've only read a couple of chapters in this book but I can't seems to put it down. You've got to buy this book. Dan Brown is the new #1 author on my list.
2,Fantasy Premise,"Very simply, the author starts with a false premise and continues to prove that false premise, with flawed reasoning. In physics or math we would call this a mathematical construct...like building a house with the first brick placed squarely in mid-air! The book is historically innaccurate, theologically innaccurate and inductively and deductively incorrect. Entertainment only for those susceptible to pap or who choose not to do their homework on the historical facts."
5,DaVinci Code on tape - as good as a movie!,"I drive 40 minutes to and from work each day, and The DaVinci Code book on tape made me look forward to my commute. The narration is clear, concise and exciting. I couldn't want to get to the next chapter! The only problem is not wanting to leave your car to go into work!! I created the ""visuals"" in my mind as the narrator read the book...it is almost like seeing the movie! The narrator used different accents for each character, so it is easy to differentiate the characters which makes things clearer since you don't see the text in front of you. I highly recommend this book on tape to anyone who doesn't have the time to sit and read a long book."
4,A good read!,"It was a great FICTITIOUS book. The book was very intriguing and though provoking in the sense that you really could begin to doubt certain historic events and wonder whether the catholic church really did cover up some many things. I read the book after I watched the movie and I actually prefer the story that the book portrays, the movie doesn't seem as vivid as the scenes that come across while you're reading. Dan Brown really stirred the pot on conspiracy theories with this movie, however the use of all of the symbols is quite entertaining and you can really see all of the different shapes that are depicted in the book. All in all a great book."
5,Amazing,"This book was a page turner to say the least. Not wanting to put it down and continue on at all hours of the night to see what will happen next was what was occuring wit me. For people to hate this book, they are just being ignorant. Yes it is FICTION and has some great thinking parts. Look at the cover in the mirror and see what the writing beholds for YOU! Recommend this to EVERYONE. A must read! Dont miss out!"
5,I love this book,"I am not the one addicted to detective stories, but I really like this book. Actually, I am not an expect at architectures, arts, history and religions, so I don't know which part of the book is the fact and which part is not. But I can say..this book brings me a different kind of view towards Christianity and Catholicism. Also, I can see the author, Dan Brown, has been much efforts on writing this book and done a lot of research."
2,Anti-religious Mystery,"The Da Vinci Code was a fine mystery, except for the anti-religious elements that were a huge part of the book.Since, I believe that the bible is 100% true and accurate, I was very disappointed with the logic in this book that indicate that the New Testament is false.I, therefore, can not recommend this book to any Christians - because it will be very offensive to you."
3,The Da Vinci Code,"I am so pleased that so many love this tale by Dan Brown, but myself I could not get into it. It was the what the story was about to me, but the prose itself was a bit too much to digest. I felt like Robert L. who is the lead character was cardboard in actions and unrealistic in actual talents. Somehow this cryptology expert is suddenly an expert at dodging bullets and jumping out of windows onto moving vehicles. I suppose it would have been too much to give him some sort of law enforcement or military background like so many writers do, but in his case it may have helped. Robert Ludlum Dan Brown is not, and although the story was extremely interesting, it was the lack of depth that the characters possessed combined with far fetched achievements in the field that I cannot give it any higher than three stars."
3,"Not bad, but not quite my thing either","I thought the book read well, and was somewhat interesting but was very contrived and ""Harry Potter"" ish for me, although I have to admit that I personally find non-fiction far more interesting and fascinating than a made up story with predictable conclusions. Not a bad read, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about."
4,A wonderful book!!!,"This is a very interesting novel. I also recommend it to anyone looking for speculative ""answers"" about Christianity.You may not agree with everything -- and that's certainly OK.But take whatever you get from this fictional book and then go research the actual possibilities!Also recommended: ""What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]"" by Peter Cayce"
3,"Good old-fashioned conspiracy theory, RECYCLED","The plot is around a conspiracy theory about Roman Catholic church, specifically Opus Dei order, trying to hide the role of Mary Magdalene, in their struggle against another secret organization (whose name escapes me) attempting to preserve the ""true"" story.I have no opinion one way or the other as to whether there is much merit to the theory/story, it may be true for all I know - I'm not even a Christian. But reading the book, I'm constantly reminded of the resemblance with the Illuminati trilogy, the goofy 70's (60's?) mother of all conspiracy theory tome. The author seems to progress along the other themes on the Illuminati trilogy - I hear that one of his later books is printed in Germany with the title ""Illuminati"".It's a knock-off, marketing-sanitized for the mass market today. Still a decent page turner, though."
2,"Angels and Demons was great, this was boring","Angels and Demons was great, but this was boring. I had to force myself to read this, instead of looking forward to the next chapter."
4,"Fun, interesting book.","Although this book was very controversial, I went into it reading it with an open mind. It was interesting, and I think that anyone who took it to be anything more than fiction was stretching things a bit. The book was just a fun, interesting read."
1,"Don't read, just think","Think about reading something worthwhile, that is. This book is the most amateurish fodder that I have read in years. .If your preference is to fast food for the brain, maybe you will enjoy this MacThriller."
5,Quite the stunner,"The Da Vinci code was a widely procliamed book whose plot was one that involved much controversy. Primarily, it regarded theological exploits and biblical history relevant in many people's lives today. It includes the usual mystery/deception combination, yet it wove in intricate details and mini-plots in order for the story to be a perfect writing web, all honing in on the main focus. In the story, were thrown in a whirlwind of secret societies, hidden cryptologic symbols, and countless riddles. The basic themes involved cracking said riddles, almost like a literary scavenger hunt. I was extremely impressed with the well-placed vocabulary. It felt almost as if you had to have a dictionary next to you while you read it. For some an English-Spanish/English-French was necessary. Overall, the book was fantastic. Being a Catholic, I was able to relate to many of the bible-related issues. Regardless, the book brings up great issues to debate on."
3,ready to make into a movie,"Dear fellow readers:This book, although entertaining, isn't made for people who enjoy a good read. Some chapters are only ONE page long. The book and the plot lack detail, depth, thorough research, imagination, and it reads like something that the author purposely made simple to facilitate its conversion into a motion picture. Kind of like a Sidney Sheldon or John Grisham best seller...P>Moreover, this book is just another story about a secret conspiracy by yet another secret society that is trying to rule over the world. Why are these conspiracy theories so popular? Because, due to the lack of external enemies (Soviets, Nazis, Japanese, etc.), someone feels the need to focus on internal ones (church, government, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, wall street, etc.) and how they are secretly tring to dominate our lives and minds. What I would like to know is, if all this is true, wouldn't those secret societies come crashing down upon us and make us...Best regardsAW"
3,Good but not as good as Angels,"This book was a fun read, but having read Angels & Demon's beforehand, my expectations for this one were astonishingly high. The plot was fun, and the controversial facts were also fun to read about, but the plot just didn't satisfy me as much as Angels did. I was hoping for more twists and turns than I got out of it. But overall a decent read."
2,Something's missing,"As with the other Dan Brown books I've read I wasn't happy with this one. The plot is great, the characters are wonderful. But somehow I felt like I was reading Brown's notes about the plot and people rather than walking in their shoes and listening to their thoughts."
5,Awesome,"This was a wonderful read. I could have done without some of the blood and guts, but many of you would probably miss the violence if it was left out.I was delighted with the story: an explanation of what is meant by The Holy Grail in some quarters. (This definition certainly makes more sense than most others.) I particularly like to read about first century events, and since I don't really admire the Church in Rome, this sort of story certainly resonates. Altogether a wonderfully plotted and executed book, and I cannot praise it too highly. (And the movie wasn't bad, either!)Arch"
4,Good page turner,"The Da Vinci Code is an enjoyable thriller, and includes a number of interesting alternative historical tidbits. Unfortunately, Brown is no Umberto Eco, who could have done much more with the subject matter. The characters are wooden, and the plot depends too much on explication through unrealistic dialogue (including a number of long discussions in dangerous situations). The short chapters punctuated by cliffhangers seem to form a bit of a rhythm after a while. All in all, though, it is a good and interesting read."
2,This is just plain silly,"This has got to be a record number of theories that can packed into one story. I have never read such a disjointed, mishmash of unresearched untruths in my entire life...The Georgia O'Keefe and Disney tie-ins were pretty absurd to say the least. Why do people eat this ...up? I am going to ask for my money back."
1,A bad book and a bad narration,"The book is an overwrought thriller, long on unimaginative descriptions and short on real people. And the narration for the book on tape is dull, dull, dull."
5,The point is beyond the fiction...,"While I agree with some of the other reviews of this book in that the romantic story and forced suspense are mediocre at best, the resonnating fascination for me is the factual undercurrent that binds it all together. This book speaks volumes to anyone who has ever questioned organized religion, and does more justice for DaVinci's genius than most art books I've read. The truths Dan Brown shares in this book will leave you astonished, and good story or not, the possibilities he offers up about the Holy Grail are not soon to leave your conscious!"
5,Pictures Make A Difference!,"Even if you have already read the Da Vinci Code, if you haven't seen the illustrated version, you have missed out on a lot. If you have NOT read this book, it's an absolute MUST_READ! All controversy aside, it's a story you will never forget, a mystery you will not be able to put down and it is , after all, just a novel to be enjoyed as such. Reading the illustrated version is like stepping into an art gallery and beyond! The corresponding pictures and drawings really bring the story to life and give a visual picture and meaning that go beyond the words. I highly recommend this book. The paperback format (and price) allowed me to own this book and all its wonderful pictures for my library, as the hardcover price for this special edition is a bit pricey for my budget."
1,Abbott and Costello on the Moon giving a bad name to paganism,"I don't understand why anyone would take this novel seriously if they have read the gnostic texts, like the Gospel of Phillip, upon which the novel is supposedly based.As historical fiction, to me it reads as bogus, to draw an analogy, to science fiction where astronauts in the vacuum of space can breathe without space helmets or walk and talk without gravity boots or radios.That's alright for something frivolous--like Abbott and Costello--or if, more subtly, the book were a parody of all conspiracy theories; but so far I'm not sure how the plot holes of this novel can be filled so generously."
4,A Thoughtful Read,"Whether you believe all the details or not, this book is definitely worth the read! The ""facts"" are very intriguing, and I found myself grabbing my Bible, and doing google searches in order to take a closer look at many of DaVinci's works of art. For that aspect alone, it's worth the read....great mind-stimulation!The build-up throughout the book and the character development are excellent, but I must admit that I was disappointed in the ending (the only reason I give this book a 4 out of 5). I guess I was expecting something more spectacular based on what I'd read up until that point. To the author's credit, the book does leave much room for personal interpretation. All of that said, I would highly recommend this book to others."
5,Sparked a new interest in a non reader,"Sad to say it, but this is the first book Ive read since highschool. Now, many might say thats why I gave it five stars, but I would have to disagree. This book had me from the first page and in my opinion there was never a dull moment. Another one of his books that might just be a little better (and I say might) is Angels & Demons. Also Deception point was really good. Hope my opinion was helpful. I didnt want to get all into details, and historical information cause it is a fictional story, but it will make you question a lot of what you may have brought up to believe."
4,"A very enjoyable read, but short on substance","This is arguably one of the best written books I have read. It strikes the perfect balance between providing enough details to allow the reader to become absorbed without too many details where it becomes boring. The suspense really never lets up from cover to cover. Unfortunately, despite protests from religious zealots, this book is rather mild from what it could have been. It fails to develop anything significant with a promising premise."
2,Interesting History Lesson- Pathetic Mystery Story,"This book was obviously written with the film rights in mind. it starts out with a somewhat interesting premise, but rapidly becomes completely unbelievable. The detectives and prime suspect all do things that strain my ability to suspend disbelief beyond the breaking point. The history and explanation of the hidden codes were interesting, but could probably be explained better in a straightforward and scholarly book better. The story started out unbelivable and got worse from there."
2,DaVinci a repeat of Angles and Demons,"This book was a bit of a disappointment after all of the hype. I had read Brown's previous book, Angels and Demons, first -and found the DaVinci Code to be almost entirely the same in terms of plot, character, pace, twists, and ending. The only difference between the books is the religious, historical topic at the center of the plot. Otherwise, same book, different secret society. I found it very hard to finish because of this. I got bored halfway through, and I guessed the plot twists and endings too easily (because I had been through his writing once before).The historical and artistic ideas in this book are interesting, but the writing is extremely shallow. Read it if you want a good page-turner, not a great work of character development or literature. And I would recommend only reading one of his books, because the second is sure to be a repeat and a disappointment."
1,Pap & Treacle,"This leviathan of inanity has generated such a tremendous amount of attention that I was suckered into reading it. After doing so, I honestly can't understand why it got any attention at all, let alone the busloads it did... it lacks both the emotional depth of even a mediocre novel and the energy of a Grade C bus-depot thriller. I honestly can't fathom why, after reading this terrible book, one would want to do anything other than try to eradicate any trace of it from one's brain. I could say that it's numbingly pedestrian, that it's deplorably ordinary, or that it's unsettlingly tiresome, but in the end what matters is that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is dull, dull, dull..."
2,What's the hype????,"OK, so this seems to be ""THE"" book to read right now. And so, hearing the raves (although not from anyone I know personally), I went out and read this one. What a disappointment. The big flaw in this so-called thriller is that Brown doesn't let you in on the solution. He tells you only so much, giving you obscure clues that you could NEVER figure out, introducing clues at the last minute. And giving you an oh-so-pat ending that you feel like throwing the book across the room when you finish it. And the characters are incredibly dumb and unconvincing (a cryptologist that doesn't recognize DaVinci's backwards writing? Gimme a break!). Trust me: spend your time reading something more rewarding. Like, maybe, the National Enquirer?"
1,Pulp fiction,"This book is poorly written. There is nothing here but a bad copy of Robert Ludlum's writing style and a feeble attempt to popularize Freemasonry. The only reason for the hype surrounding this book is that it attacks Christianity and Catholic church. As a computer security expert, I find cryptographic references in the book laughable."
4,Pure entertainment,"This book was pure entertainment: a fun page-turner. If there were separate 5-star scales for ""entertainment"" versus ""literature,"" I would give The Da Vinci Code 5 entertainment stars. It isn't a 5-star work of literature- but after a long day of work, or while stuck in an airport during a 4-hour layover, this is definitely an easier story for the reader to escape into than something by George Eliot or Herman Melville.It's surprising that some of the other reviews of this book have been so negative. It isn't fine literature, or even posing as such. It isn't a work of religious scholarship or history, nor does it pretend to be. It's just pure entertainment with some fun brain teasers and a much more creative plot than most other action/thriller novels."
4,KISS (Keep It Simple...),"I wanted to read this book because of all the hype; but couldn't get through the trenches of the writing. After the first 8 chapters (they are pretty short) the book was too confusing. Flash backs, flash forwards...I felt inundated. I finally had to see the movie to understand the book. Now I will go back and read the book with the baseline of what the story is all about.However, I applaud Dan for his creativity. Taking a subject such as religion, where we all absolutely know the religious story of ""Easter"" from childhood and other stories of Christianity and here comes the ""Da Vinci Code"" metaphorically pulling the rug from under our feet is pretty genius. Good going Dan, but next time...easy on the pen..."
2,Cracking the Dan Brown Code,"The son of a prep school math teacher and a church organist, Dan Brown has publically confessed an uncomfortableness with absolute faith. During a recent speech, he said, ""I was not born with the luxury of absolute certainty or absolute faith. I have a lot of questions. I've written a novel in which fictional characters ask some of those questions and offer possible answers."" So is the DaVinci Code really a work of fiction or a book about Dan Brown's quest for answers? I guess it's up to the reader to decide.Frankly, I've grown weary of techo-thrilling, conspiracy busting, orthodoxy deconstructing novels. Give me the well-told story over the controversial theory anyday. The DaVinci Code made me want to reread all those wonderful Alistair Maclean novels (Ice Station Zebra, Guns of Naverone, etc.). Bring back the Master Storyteller!"
3,The shift in women's power,"Mr. Brown isn't that great a writer. His spelling and grammar are atrocious. But what I did enjoy about this novel were the questions it raised: Exactly how much truth is in the Bible and how accurate is the current interpretation? It sent me on a spiritual journey, particularly regarding women's roles throughout history. And the BIG question it raised was what happened to bring about the shift in power from women to men? And what will it take for women to get it back again? If, for nothing else, this novel was well worth raising all the controversy. [...]"
4,Enjoyable and interesting,"""The Da Vinci Code"" is fast-paced and exciting, and written in an easy and engaging style. It appears somewhat influenced by Hollywood, with its characterization and slightly disbelief-suspending plot. The main characters seem to be able to get out of every situation, surviving life-threatening encounters so often that you start to believe them to be untouchable rather than smart-thinking.The concept of a secret code is based on the gnostic gospels, and the book characterizes Catholicism in a less-than-favorable light, glorifying Langdon and Neveu, the investigators and protagonists, as heroes. Because of this, it can be seen as offensive. However, with such a fictional style as this, it is hard to take Brown wholly seriously in his claims.An easy and enjoyable read; an interesting concept but one that I would only explore with imagination."
4,Definately a page turner.....,"I enjoyed reading the DaVinci Code, just like with Angels and Demons, I had a hard time putting it down. I did enjoy Angels and Demons a bit more, it was faster paced and felt like less of a history lesson. It was sometimes hard to sort out all of the information laid out in the story but it was well presented and easy to understand. Whether or not you believe the premise of the novel does not detract from its entertainment value. I can't help but wonder about all of the contoversy, it is after all a fictional story based on theories and opinions. I marvel at the amount of research both The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons must have required. Dan Brown definately did his homework."
3,"Great Plot, Average writing","OK, the plot was compelling. The writing, however, was common and predictable. This novel is NOT literature and no one can say that this is a beautifully-written book."
1,This Book Disturbs Me,"I do not like the premise of this book. It casts doubt on Christianity and the true nature of God. It disturbs me that this is on the best-seller list, and that millions of people are being exposed to this rubbish. Your time would be much better served by reading The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren. He describes the truth of Christianity with such wisdom that your life will be transformed forever."
1,Sometimes a book shouldn't be written or published...,This is one of those times...I'd like to believe that the author was just writing a gripping mystery....but I think his intent was much more serious..and wrong.
1,Incredible Disappointment,I am so amazed that such a poorly written book has garnered so much attention and praise. This goes to show what American marketing can do for what's really a worthless peice of [choose your pleasure].The writing is dull and lifeless. It couldn't even pull me in. I was amazed at how utterly boring the book was.The pictures are the ONLY redeemable factor to this edition. THe book itself is a merciless waste of trees.
5,Da Vinci Code Review,"The Da Vinci Code is superb! Not only does it have an excellent story line, but the theory and facts were so interesting I was compelled to do more research upon completion of the the book. It was so good that my boyfriend and I almost got into an argument overview who was going to read the book, while reading the same book at the same time. Overall, it was an excellent and informative book that challenges some of the principles of Christianity. If you are a person who seeks unconventional thought and information, this book is a must read!"
3,OK but Not Great,"This is above average for a mystery thriller and is an entertaining read. However, almost inevitably, it has a hard job keeping up with the hype. The premise is interesting and, provided you are able to suspend disbelief, it's OK. Due to the innumerable minor errors however, such suspension is difficult. The questionable historical theories put forward are addressed in other reviews. On a far more pragmatic level - GPS cannot do what it is said to do in this book (why are so many authors in love with modern technology without being capable of understanding its limitations?) and the hand built british sports car briefly referred to is an Aston Martin, not an Astin Martin. Minor points I know but capable of instantly dispelling credibility."
5,A brief comment,"I rarely read fiction anymore, usually preferring nonfiction these days, but I made an exception for this book because of everything I'd heard about it. I'd also read Holy Blood, Holy Grail some years ago, which it's said Brown's book is a fictionalization of. So religious thrillers aren't exactly my cup of tea, but I found Brown still created a fast paced, interesting, and well-done story that's a lot better than the vast majority of other novels out there. I also found Brown to be a competent writer who knows how to put together a well-crafted mystery. Overall a fine book and I look forward to seeing the movie."
3,Great Subject but predictable Plot,I loved Angels and Demons- and I really enjoyed the subject matter in Da Vinci Code but if I could guess what was coming with the plot line it was obvious. I never try to figure out mysteries I enjoy letting them unfold in the read. I had this one figured out way too early for my enjoyment. Still a good book- hard to put down but not nearly as fantastic as previous works. I learned a lot and will probably purchase a number of nonfiction works in this subject area.I had to go on line and look up the art works that were described in the text and found that some of the pieces are easily mistaken (Madonna on the rocks and Virgin on the Rocks ) Some were even misnamed at a university site (astron.berkeley.edu/~kalas/disksite/ pages/madonna.html) should be Virgin on the rocks not Madonna- since this is the revised toned down image.Well worth the effort- wait for paperback
1,Fantastic for all the wrong reasons...,"This book was the worst! I laughed out loud the whole way through. Dan Brown treats you like a moron so you feel like a genius when you solve the riddles before his world famous (but not very bright) experts do.Two page chapters! Ridiculous dialogue!If you've never before heard the theory that the bible might not have been written by God Himself, never used a library search engine, and never been outside of your home town, then this is a book of challenging ideas and exotic landscapes.I admit it - I loved reading this book - but it's not getting any more stars from me!"
1,Excellent writing for a 3rd-Grader,"I don't like to judge books without reading them, and sadly I did finish this sophomoric (is there such a thing as freshmanic?) work of ""literature."" Dave Barry said it better than anyone else by ""writing"" his own version in a column that was not only wittier, but more engrossing -- all in about 1/2 page. When you have to stoop to cheap cliffhanger tricks at the end of every chapter to make certain the reader doesn't just stop reading and go play on the swingset, you might as well put down the pen and go work in the yard.This book simply confirms the dreaful state of affairs produced by the pitiful public education system we're saddled with here in the US."
4,"Lets get real: Great FICTIONAL story,","I thought my review of this work would be pretty involved given all of the hullaballoo around it, and the story. I have been under the impression that this book is some kind of very true to life story. I believe, even if it is based on a theory, it is and was never meant to be anything but a story. It is a fantastic story. I thought it was a fantastic book, very engrossing and a nice break from the real world!It kind of reminded me of ""Atlas Shrugged"" or ""The carpetbaggers""..... I don't know what else to say, If you LOVE picking up a book, and then raising your head three hours later to realize you have been immersed in the story for hours, then this kind of reading is for you."
3,An AMAZON FIRST,This is an Amazon first kind of review in the sense that I am reviewing another reader's review. I am referring to Mr. David C. Read. I enjoyed his thoughts on the Da Vinci code simply because we share the same reaction to Mr. Brown's book. It is a work of fiction and it is indeed frightening to find some people taking it seriously. Da Vinci code is a good read yes but it is as fulfilling as a piece of fluff to read while waiting for a root canal.Three stars.
3,Lost his creative spark . . .,"After the first 350 pages (which were great), we find out that ""the butler did it"". From that point on the book is hollow. Where's the punchline? Where's the crescendo? It seems that there was so much creative energy expended up front, that the author had nothing left for the ending. He lost his creative spark and the book sputtered to a contrived, plastic ending. I can understand why this book sold well. The first three quarters is well written, fast moving and interesting. In the end, it felt like they rushed it out with little thought to the last 100 pages. Sorely disappointed."
4,Well Researched,"Although this book is very fast-paced and clever in its first half, the cleverness factor diminishes toward the end. Many were shocked by the ending, but I found it somewhat cliched and predictable. The historical content was impressive."
4,"Great, interesting read.","This book wont go down as great literature, but it could potentially change the thoughts of a lot of people. It did me.The story is fairly tight and only slows down in a couple of spots.Mr. Brown provides a fair amount of history, but its well worth it. I look forward to reading some of this other books."
1,Not Impressed,"This is a poor example of a novel. I place this book on the same literary level as a trashy romance novel (and I don't see Daniel Steel writing bestsellers). There are FAR TOO MANY coincidents among the main characters. It is VERY VERY poorly researched and the ""facts"" are quite inaccurate. Any FICTION writer that has a ""FACT"" page at the front of their novel should be shot. This one page is leading people to believe what Dan Brown writes is true and highly accurrate, when in truth, his writing is just the opposite.If you don't believe me, then buy the book and waste your money.I actually had to force myself to finish reading this novel."
1,I don't see what's so great about it,"This was, to me, a mildly good action-adventure book that took the ""suspense"" a little too far. After awhile, the ""on the edge"" excitement got wearing and it would have been nice to have a breather. The mini mysteries were fun, but most of the religious symbolism was lost on me. I wouldn't say it was anything grand or amazing, but I don't feel cheated out of those hours of my life, either."
4,Not that bad,"This book to be honest was boring at frist but got better as i read onward. I like that plot,it made me think. Other than being sometimes a dry read it was a good book. The subject of this book I would think would be a big topic of disscotion. i learned several things."
3,Only Average,"I bought this book to see what all of the hype was about like so many others. I did finish it, so i cant say that i was unimpressed. But i will give my review a bit of a break-down.First the good: Lots of history, whether you believe it or not is your problem. Clearly lots of research was put into this novel.The the not-so-good: If Dan Brown was the one who uncovered this research, then i would have given it five stars. The fact that it was pretty much all based on the novel Holy Blood Holy Grail, I was disappointed. It seemed to be centered around this book with a bit of fictional characters to give the perception of plot. Id see a little bit of ""action"" then get a 45 minute history lesson. I disagree with the statements on the back cover thta suggest this is suspenseful.In all, I should have bought Holy Blood Holy Grail and just read that, which im still considering. I might try some of Brown's other books but wasn't too impressed with the hype of ""The Code."""
1,Absolutely Stunning!,The real DaVinci is nothing compared to Dan Brown and his masterpiece! All I can say is read it now!
4,Who Owns the Code?,"First I thought the novel was well-executed and this is helped by the short viginette chapters. The wall paper of Europe and religious history is a nice decoration but the focus is on the myth. And that is all this is. Ther claim of truth at the beginning is misinterpreted in my view. The paintings are real as are the locations. The entities are real but in the case of the Priory of Sion is a debunked sham. Making it real for the novel is allowed though.The problem is that this was already written in two other novels and all of the themes are indentical in the two books. Enough was changed to make the claim of originality in the form of character names and the title of the main thesis: Jesus married Mary Magdalene and they have descendants protecting her bones and legacy. From the looks of things and the attention this is the only declaration that separates the books in question. This one and ""Daughter of God.""Is that enough? Who knows?"
1,Fanciful research,Dan Brown certainly has an ax to grind against the Roman Catholic Church. This book is a blatant example of anti-Catholic bias.
4,Mystery of Mysterys,"Unlike many reviews I found the book quite compelling.Mystery, Crytography and riddles throughout kept your mind busy.With a plot of religious background it makes this quite a thinking person's novel. I strongly recommend it and will look forward to reading his other books."
1,Anti-Catholic Bigots' Delight,"If you are a radical feminist or an anti-Catholic bigot, you will love this book. Otherwise, stay away."
3,New Age writer's thriller,"This book was interesting to read. Many of his facts or suggestions were intriguing.As a christian, I had some mixed feelings about some of the alleged ""conspiracy theory"" of this atheist writer.In fact, I did not like the way this writer tries to sell his ""natural"" beliefs through his characters in this fiction.In the end, this book is a cheap thrill. It mocks the fundamental principles of Christianity."
1,GOOD GOD YOU IDIOTS!,"THIS BOOK WAS SO HORRIBLE I CALLED MY MOM UP AND ASKED HER TO SEE IF IT WAS REAL AND IF IT WAS, THAT I WAS GOING TO HIDE FOREVER. THIS BOOK IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST OVERRATED NOVEL EVER WRITTEN. YOU PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED. I COULD'VE SPENT THE 26 DOLLARS ON SOMETHING MUCH BETTER, LIKE A MAKESHIFT CATTLE PROD. IN FACT, I RETURNED ALL 5,621 COPIES I BOUGHT AND BOUGHT SOME BACK TO BURN THEM. I AM DISGUSTED AT THIS NOVEL. YOU KNOW THAT THING ABOUT IF YOU SET MONKEYS IN A ROOM WITH TYPEWRITERS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, THEY'D WRITE THE ENTIRE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE? WELL, THEY'D WRITE THE DA VINCI CODE IN 3 MINUTES! I MEAN, IT'S SOOO PREDICTABLE! YOU KNOW THAT JESUS ENDS UP IN FRANCE, WHICH BY THE WAY, IS A STUPID ENDING. I SPIT UPON IT! I NEED TO TAKE A BREATHER, I'M GETTING ALL WORKED UP. MAYBE SOME BADMINTON WILL CHEER ME UP. NO!! THE BOOK IS TOO HORRIBLE, EVEN FOR BADMINTON TO CHEER ME UP!! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!Q"
1,Stupid,"It constantly insulted my intelligence with its constant stupidity. How can anyone possibly take a book that cites the dead sea scrolls and Disney movies as theological proof that The Holy Grail is not a grail, but a woman, seriously? I mean, Disney wasn't even alive when The Little Mermaid was made, and I really doubt that he dedicated his life to spreading the message that Christ had a blood line and was married to the holy female. ??!!When I realized it was about the Holy Grail I suddenly saw connections with Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Obviously Dan Brown isn't clever enough to come up with his own Holy Grail quest without ripping off Hollywood cliches.If you want to understand the Quest for the Holy Grail and its impact, watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail for complete historical context."
1,Should come with a warning!,"The book will insult even average intelligence. It is infantile and inaccurate. Dan Brown "" the Master of the Obvious!"
2,Christians Beware,"Book Quote: ""The New Testament is false testimony"". If you are even a casual Christian - the premise of this book will offend you. (The following provides some insight but does not give away the ending.) The world created by Dan Brown requires you to believe that Christ had children with Mary Magdalene, and that his rising was fabricated by the Catholic church in its effort to subjugate the world. Ugh! Ron Brown depicts Christians, and the Church was the bad guys, and the goddess worshiping, new age spiritualist as the protagonists. The main character, Langdon, is a cardboard cutout, Indiana Jones wanta-be, who couldn't even carry Indiana's fedora."
3,He was a teacher!,"The Da Vinci Code is a spine-tingling, twister that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A while back, a friend turned me on to Holy Blood, Holy Grail; which started the whole Jesus had kid's brouhaha, and after reading it, I was prompted to do a bit more (historical) research into the custom's and culture of Christ's era. As it turns out, Christ was a Rabbi, and if that's the case, I think it's quite possible he had children. It goes against Jewish teachings for a Rabbi (which means teacher) to be single and/or without family. After all, how could he teach men matrimonial tolerance (the implication of which only a married man can comprehend) if he were unfamiliar with the experience? Historical record and common sense would suggest that Jesus was a happily married, revolutionary man with a beautiful wife; translation, children. In any event, whether you believe the subject matter or not, the book's a hit."
1,Pick up a used copy,"Don't believe the hype. This is a very basic thriller, containing information that's standard in an introductory college-level art history class. The ""puzzles"" are laughable at best, character development is nil, and the writing style is about ninth grade. Plenty of artistic license has been taken with history. If you enjoy formulaic stories, you'll like it; if you want more substance, you probably won't."
4,An Exciting Page Turner!,"I am not one to sit down and read a 400+ page book, but I was indeed possessed to do so and I picked it up and read page one - then I was hooked!It is a fasciniating murder mystery that gripped me from the git-go. I found it to be written well - an easy read, yet it engaged my intellect. The book is well researched. I can't even begin to imagine the amount of time and effort that went into researching and writing this book!I will also tell you I loved the ending. It wasn't corny or sappy, but it felt real. It ended in a way that I was satisfied and not left wishing for a different ending. It felt good when I was done.Mr. Brown did an excellent job on this masterpiece. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting and gripping read."
2,Figured it out before the end,"The anti-christian story line and the woman's down play in christianity is interesting. All the puritan, christian fundamentalists hate it. This is not meant to be truth but fiction!!!The plot itself is very simple and unlike Agatha Christie or Sir Conan Doyle, I figured out the ending about half way through and by 2/3 of the book it was confirmed.Ths bits about Paris and London are OK if you have never been there.Overall entertaining but far from the fuss that every one makes of it. can only be read once."
3,Less Suspense than Anticipated,"While this was a decent book, I found it lacking after Angels and Demons. A&D gripped me in a page-turning suspense with unseen twists. DVC seemed like it was trying too hard to make a point, and followed a rather well-known and over-used suspense plot. I was annoyed to be able to figure out most of the story well before the ending.Also lacking in this book was the relationship between the Langdon and his lead woman. It seems forced at the end and has very little throughout the story to imply anything should happen. This is a huge disappointment after the portrayal of the perfect ""Indiana Jones-style"" lusting in A&D.While I would still (hesitantly) recommend this book, I would suggest being prepared for a disappointment after the first Robert Langdon journey, which I would highly recommend to anyone."
3,Can't stay out of the soup,"This book was very good initially, then I got bogged down in the soup. Some parts seemed to drag on & on. I often resorted to skimming paragraphs in an effort to edit."
3,Hollywood style formula fiction,"Historic/Government secret + Discovery channal information + conspiracy/mystery murder + innocent figitive + romance = Pop fiction/movieThe Da Vinci Code is the same produce after the calculation.No bad, but not too much suprise, quite enteraining"
2,One-dimensional characters barely carry the plot,"I was excited to read this, having heard from so many people how they *loved* this book. Imagine my surprise when I found an interesting plot (I don't know how much of it is accurate, but his main thesis is fun to consider) but with such boring, cardboard one-dimensional characters, that I kept getting distracted by how bad they were. The book is readable, but by no means a feat of literature. As a friend of mine said, it is like reading a Hardy boys' mystery...but without the pathos!"
2,Bad book - bad reviews,OK ok - I did read the book and I thought it stunk. Poorly written drivel for the masses. Akin to romance novels. A book with nothing to offer to anyone but viewers of reality TV.And to people like John Sebastian. You really need to learn to direct you anger towards something positive and stop bashing other reviewers. Hypocrites abound @ Amazon.com!
1,How bad can a book be? Dan Brown tests the limits.,"Simply the worst-written book I've ever read. Yes, the plot is (just) amusing enough to keep you reading (though pretty implausible), but only at the expense of having your intelligence insulted by the most cliché-ridden, clumsily-written prose you're ever likely to encounter.Perhaps the rave reviewers don't mind how their entertainment is delivered (just as millions are apparently satisfied with their daily burger), but if you require even the most basic attention to literary style from your reading material, avoid this book like the... um... well, I'm sure Dan Brown would have a suitable expression to use here."
3,Great Story... So-So Writing,"There's nothing I could share about the plot tht wouldn't give something away or hasn't been shared by another reviewer... With that said, I enjoyed this book. It took me three nights to finish it and I am glad I finally got around to reading it. I thought the ideas and story were awesome; however, Brown's ability as a writer was just mediocre. If there is a sequel, I will more than likely read it; however, if the next book is not a sequel, I will probably pass. Would LOVE to see something like this in the hands of Preston-Child!"
2,"Well told story, wacky theology","This book is written in an engaging style and the story draws you in quickly. The writer's knowledge of France and Art is impressive. The mystery aspect is pretty well done also, but there are HUGE problems. The bizarre theology and deep and ongoing conspiracy theories are hard to tolerate. The wacky theological presentations are especially offensive to devout Christians, accurate historians, and others who respect the Bible."
5,Quite Possibly The Most Addicting Novel I Have Ever Read,"I don't even want to begin to describe anything within the book because I would feel that I would give something away to those who haven't read it yet. I can, however, say this: READ THIS BOOK. Quite simple, I know, but there is no other way for me to express myself. This book was FANTASTIC. I have read plenty of page turners, but I literally could not get any work done while I was reading this book. Dan Brown is truly a master story teller. I don't even want this book to be made into a movie in fear that the story will be ruined. I can keep going on and on for pages about this book, but I wont because I don't want people to spend time reading my review instead of reading The Da Vinci Code"
2,Eco does it better,"This is a good beach read but that is about it. My main problem with it was that I had been lead to believe by the hype that it was intellectual. As far as I can see, Dan Brown has taken a mis-mash of tired old theories about the power of the Church and symbology and formed them into a pretty good thriller. There is very little new here in the way of ideas and the writing style is not particularly lyrical (two things that I personally like in novels.) Umberto Eco has done somewhat the same thing in Foucault's Pendulum and he did it infinitely better."
2,Stilted and Amateurish...,"It GREATLY disappoints me that the ""facts"" in this book are conjecture since that seems to be the only thing that is interesting about DaVinci's Code. Now I have no idea if I have truly learned anything new or if it is all fiction. The characters are thinly drawn and ""grinning"" in all the most inappropriate places. The plot is fairly predictable. If this is considered to be a GREAT read by mystery readers, I had better stick to literature."
3,Theologically too inaccurate,"I started the book and couldn't put it down. Around page 200 the book takes a turn. Dan Brown misstates several things as he weaves the story together. I have a degree in Theology and can read a wide range of thoughts, but when Dan Brown says things like ""YHWH was derived from Jehovah"" it is troublesome... since in fact, Jehovah was derived from YHWH by the Germans who had a hard time pronounching YHWH. - the exact opposite! Dan Brown wrote a page turner - but unless you have an academic background in theology or church history, you could easily mistake his fiction for fact... be careful not to believe this book."
2,Much better books are out there.,"After hearing a friend rave about how complex and interesting this book was, I decided to sit down and read it. Considering that there are so many great books around with similar concepts, this was pretty much a waste of time. I would much rather have spent the time rereading Eco's ""Name of the Rose"" or Wilton Bernhardt's ""Gospel,"" both of which pull off the religious-mystery concept far, far better than this book."
2,Annoying,"The minute I knew who the knight was, the ""orb"" was obvious, but I had to spend the next 50 pages reading about a ""Harvard professor"" and a police cryptolgist who were not readily able to figure it out. While that ought to be enough, I would also mention that the alleged right/left masculine/feminine equation is factually inaccurate. This book has pretenses of being intellectual and clever, but the characters are shallow, the plot not unpredictable and the pretense somewhat outrageous. I am not catholic so that aspect of it did not offend me. One might read Umberto Eco, Phillip Kerr or others instead."
4,"ENTERTAINING, BUT.............","...was disappointed at the ending. I know the book has had a lot of negative reviews, from angry ""Art Historians"". However, wheter it was or wasn't accurate to their artistic liking, I must give credit to Mr. Brown for his fantastic imagination and the journey he took us on. As for the Opus Dei, they do exist."
4,Don't read any more reviews!!!,"I am so glad I read this book even though I almost didn't based on the reviews I saw posted on this site. As usual, there are always those who get excited about the inaccuracy of certain facts or believers who are afraid of other ideas... Is it an attack on the Church? No, it's not. It's a work of fiction, folks! Lighten up! Only an open mind can access to the next level. Unfortunately, this world has its share of frightened and close-minded christians.The puzzle itself is a bit weak but the story line is entertaining. Light reading for those nights when there is too much reality TV. Don't be put off by these reviews - pick it up for what it is - a few nights of fun! Enjoy!"
3,"Umberto Ecco light - less filling, less flavor","I don't understand the success of this book. It follows meekly in the footsteps of many more insightful, intricate mysteries woven around this same plot. This felt like a Fox tv pilot of an Umberto Ecco novel."
4,"fast, fun, thought-provoking read","After reading this and Angels & Demons, I look forward to the next books in Brown's Robert Langdon series. If you have any interest in Church history, conspiracy theories, art history... even the roots of holidays and common phrases, these are great reads for you. Brown knows how to hook you, over and over and over... You'll want to start your own research, study the paintings and sculptures mentioned, read up on the Grail legend, etc. While Brown's writing style is pretty simple, the puzzles in the book will keep you on edge. I read both, so I see some pretty obvious patterns in his plots... I just hope the next Langdon book is a little less predictable with the arrangement of characters. Other than that-- this is just sheer fun!"
1,"Good story, poor writing","Dan Brown may be a bestselling storyteller but he lacks, or doesn't care about, basic writing skills. One of the first things fledgling writers learn is ""show, don't tell."" This book is rife with mundane sentences stating that a character was amazed, or stunned, or worried, or that she/he looked puzzled,confused, alarmed. These emotions should be shown through the character's actions, body language, dialogue.Point of view jumps all over the place. Chapters begin with one character's point of view and before long, out of the blue, it's someone else's, then someone else's.The question is: Why didn't an editor pick up these blatant errors, along with misuse of capitalization (i.e. the Pope, when it should be the pope)?These things were annoying. I finally scanned the last half of the book simply to find out how the story ended."
1,The worst part is...,"The worst part is: some editor actually thought this guy could write. I stopped on page 50 after 50 pages of annoying writing. I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt, but he just can't write. If you like pulp fiction and are not annoyed by bad writing, you may enjoy this for the plot. I still like the plot and wish someone with talent had written the story. ew. ew. ew! This book reads like a freshman writing workshop project gone bad (and there's no such thing as a freshman writing workshop)."
2,"Tedious Fantasy, Bad History","This book was hyped as some sort of innovation when it came out. It was acclaimed by many, but after reading it I thought all these people must have drunk the cool-aid. This was too dense to be enjoyable. I mean the first 15 pages were good, but then it just got plain tedious. And this is coming from someone who thinks textbooks are enjoyable to read. Then it just gets bogged down in Brown's mental paradise which is filled with some very odd images. I mean, really, a great conspiracy to keep all this covered up? Not likely. Anyway, I just thought this was boring and too long. I would have read Differential Equations or something else more accessible than this. Avoid this book!!!!"
5,One of the best books I have read for a while,"This was an excellent book that was very difficult to put down when started. A fascinating read with lots of twists and turns of a classic chase, but also so much information about so many aspects of religion. Fascinating. And I am not a religious nut. I would not normally pick up a book for that reason, but this book taught me something about religion while being incredibly easy to read, and couched in an excellent chase.BUY IT - end of discussion"
5,Dan Brown The Da Vinci Code,Dan Brown The Da Vinci Code is excellent as are all his books.highly recommended for all and religious people should read with an open mind
3,Fun but Eco is better.,"I had fun reading this mystery novel, butI agree with the reader from Columbia, SC, June 9th. Umberto Eco is much better. Brown's prose is often trite. Eco is a class act. Read Eco."
5,Rivetting to the last page,"I was interested but extremely skeptical about the book I received for my birthday. But after reading I will be purchasing more of Dan Brown's work. The character's are well-developed (I easily identified with their reasoning and emotions), the plot is both complicated, but extremely simplistic in its thought. You just get pulled deeper and deeperin this amazing story with its many twists and turns, page after page. The research (wife is art historian), insight from first hand accounts of art, architecture, history, and real societies and oganizations make this story one of the best I have read. Read this, you won't regret it."
4,Get Over Your Academia and Enjoy the MYSTERY!,"This was a wonderful book for anyone who likes twisty-turny mysteries and puzzles and stories that make you think, ""Did that REALLY HAPPEN?"" ""Is that true?"" Who cares that there are factual inaccuracies, it's FICTION!!!I found the Audio book quite enjoyable as well as the hardcover. (Though the reader's ""French"" accent turned off a couple of friends.)This book is terrific, and who reads mysteries for the grammar anyway??"
3,"Not as lame as Angels and Demons, but not up to the hype","I read ""Angels and Demons"" first, and it has a plot hole you can drive truck through - at least this book is better. For some reason this book has a ""buzz"" about it - I think some folks think this is based on facts. If you read it as light fiction, it is OK. Anyone paying much attention will easily figure out who ""teacher"" is LONG before the characters in the book.Get it from the library or wait for the paperback.Dennis"
5,Dan Brown is awesome,"It is the best book... I am normally not a big reader, but I do have to say that Dan Brown really knows how to keep people interested. He has a way of writting that it is so easy to paint a mental picture of what you are reading, that it is easy to think that you are in the middle of the action. I read this book and I had to get the prequel. ( Angels and Demons ). It is just as good, if not better. I am almost done with it and I already oredered two of his other books, Digital Fortress and Deception Point"
4,"Gripping, but fact?","The 'boys own adventure' quality of the opening chapters certainly gets one in and produces a fast paced and gripping read. That said, while one can accept the three opening statements of fact before the prologue, it is difficult to see how this relates to the following theory which is stated as fact. Brown accepts that history is written by the victors and is used to present their views and actions in a favourable light and leads one tp believe that the Church has been the victor since Constantine. Why then does history record the crusades and inquisition as a negative aspect of the Church?From my study of history, there is little to support the survival of any Templars after the executions ordered by Philip IV of France in 1314. Further, I can find nothing in documented history beyond rumour to connect Roslyn Chapel with the Knights Templar.The Da Vinci Code is a good read but not to be taken as fact."
5,Wow! I am Stunned! Don't Miss This!,"I have read some of the reviews, and I don't see why people take it so literally. Last time I looked, it was a work of fiction! This book is the best I have read this year, right behind Angels and Demons, also by Brown. The story gets interesting from the first page, and you cannot put it down. Brown uses historical links to Masons and the Church to really get you wrapped up in the Secret Society bit. Once you start reading this, you will be in awe. If you only read one book this year, make it this one. Better yet, if you have not read Angels and Demons, pick both up and read that one first! You will not be sorry!"
3,Decent,"I found the book to be at best a quick read. I was pretty disappointed and don't understand what all the hype was about. I didn't think it was deeply compelling or important or remotely insightful about the Church. Dan Brown does keep you turning the pages, though. Maybe my expectations were unfairly high."
2,Horrible Writing,"The story has the potential to be good, but in the end, Dan Brown's lack of skill as a writer makes this a disappointing read."
1,Didn't get past the 1st chapter (yawnnn),I read mostly technical manuals and other dry stuff. Anyhow. Once in a blue moon I'll pick up a fiction novel. The 1st chapter will either hook me and I can't put it down. Or it gathers dust. This book has gathered dust. It's easy to put down and forget. Am I crazy? Maybe I'm crazy.
1,stupidest. book. EVER.,"All copies should be burned simply so this stunning example of hideous writing cannot be inflicted upon anyone else. The premise, characters, research and so-called writing are an insult to all who can read. If Mr. Brown was going to invent history he could at least have made his fiction entertaining. He's not even clever enough to manage that much."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"Normally I don't bother with popular tripe, but the book was a real page-turner. Great pacing, good writing, leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next installment."
4,"see all the art, cathedrals and items referred to in the novel","This illustrated edition is HUGE. Clunky to carry around, but it was worth it to see photos of all the cathedrals, art, and items referred to in the novel. Everyone has been lining up to borrow this copy!"
3,Silly but fun,"If anyone tells you anything more profound than this, they have some alternative agenda. If you enter the book just wanting a good read, you will not be disappointed. It is utterly silly on every level, but highly entertaining."
4,Painless to Digest,"As far as the book itself goes I would recommend this book to most anyone.It is no Dickenson or Hemmingway. But then again, that is also the very reason I would recommend it most anyone.What I mean is, it is an easy read. Fast paced. Painless to digest.As far as the debate surrounding this book goes I would still recommend it to most anyone.I have found that most people who've protested ""The Da Vinci Code"" have never even taken the time to read it. This is a shame.As a Christian I feel that reading this book actually strengthened by beliefs, instead of weakening them. It has also allowed me to take part in the international dialogue that surrounding it."
2,EXCITING BUT TOTALLY FICTION,"I found the DaVinci Code to be a mystery thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat for a time. ""The treasure hunt"" for the Grail became tiresome after a while. As a work of fiction I'm sure many people would enjoy it however the book is blantantly Anti-Catholic. Many will take Brown's research for this book as gospel, which is far from the truth. You'll find Brown's so called historical facts regarding the Catholic Church, the Knights Templars, and Christology are completely false. Anyone that doesn't think so should get the other side of the story and click on www.opusdei.org"
3,Ok But Not Revered,"Sometimes you wonder what makes a book such a best seller. Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has some suspense and intrigue. However the complicated symbols and coding does not come over too clearly. Also, it relates to a small audience.Furthermore, the character development is mediocre at best. The reader gets a very basic idea of what makes each character tick.I will admit that the ending is quite creative. There are a few interesting non-predictable moments as well. However, the scope seems for fans of mystery and intrigue. Nonetheless, there must be a lot of fans for that type of novel because this book is selling quite well."
2,The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,"A re-write of ""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail""In this book, the authors put forward a hypothesis that the historical Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to what is now southern France. Once there, they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the Merovingian dynasty, whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a secret society called the Priory of Sion.Miller attacks the Da Vinci Code on multiple levels, referring to it as ""based on a notorious hoax"", ""rank nonsense"", and ""bogus"", as she points out how heavily the book rests on the fabrications of Pierre Plantard (including the Priory of Sion which did not exist until Plantard created it) who in 1953 was arrested and convicted for just such frauds.~Wikipedia"
2,A gripping thriller with an axe to grind,"Dan Brown can certainly write a gripping thriller and the book is hard to put down with non-stop action from beginning to end. What a pity, then, that he has wanted to use the Da Vinci Code to write an anti-Christian tract. Particular venom is reserved for the Catholic Church, or ""the Vatican"" as the author likes to call it, somewhat anachronistically when he is speaking of the Church in the 4th Century AD. The references to Opus Dei are so inaccurate that it is virtually impossible to recognise the organisation as it exists in real life. It appears the author did very little proper research, at least for this aspect of the work. I feel his having such an axe to grind really detracts from the overall quality of the book."
1,Robustly corny hootfest,"Practically unreadable, this overhyped chuckleworthy book seems to parody the genre. Every paragraph is packed with cliches, and every aspect of the novel, from characterization to plot to language, has a wide silly streak. Read aloud to provoke a giggle fit.The above may sound mean-spirited, and is partially a reaction to the disconnect between the quality of this book and avid, glowing reviews from Salon and the New York Times (both by film critics; what's up with that? Do film critics not normally read?).If this sentence from an early chapter sounds ""gleefully erudite"" (jesus h, Janet Maslin!) to you, you'll probably love the Da Vinci Code:""One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brownstone residence on Rue la Bruyere.""Hulking, limping albinos! Always an excellent choice when selecting an assassin."
2,just disappointed,"I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book. The premises and subject matter hit my sweet spot. I got sucked in for the first few chapters, then I started getting angry. Repetitive suspense about things I stopped caring about, and factoid paragraphs slammed into the middle of the story as if taken verbatim from a 3x5 note card. ""Okay, I need to throw this scholarship in........HERE!"" I'm really not that hard to please. But if I'm going to help an author get rich, for chrissake, I'd at least like him to take some care and try to weave a mildly intelligent tapastry with the story and the scholarship, as if he really, truly cared about real storytelling.I will say, though, that if every history professor took up their subject with the same spirit as Mr. Brown, every child would be a historian.But for stories, this just makes me want to run back and hunker down with my David James Duncan and John Kennedy Toole and Flannery O'Connor."
2,"Formulaic, and completely implausible",Mind candy for the literally challenged. The title above says it all.
1,Don't waste your time...,"I got this book thanks to the hype and good reviews my friends, family and online gave to this book. I finally finished it last night, thank god! Like others have said, the beginning is really good. It hooks you and really gets you ""sunk"" into the book.After about 30 chapters (out of 100+), it gets tedious and boring. I found myself skipping or skimming pages, all about religion and symbology. I mean, it was boring and I really didn't like reading it all. They go on and on and on and on...there's lots of extra writing in here, where they could be more short and sweet.I didn't really think the plot was really realistic, especially certain scenes where they get out of ""messes"", such as the airplane scene. There are very few good parts. I found myself waiting and waiting for it to get better, and found myself miserable at the end.If you just ""have"" to read this, borrow someone's copy or buy one of the used, cheaper copies.I don't understand all the hype..."
1,Don't Waist Your Time,"Pure garbage, and an insult to the minds of good people. This writers intentions are in a faryland. What starts out to be good mystery, ends out being pure garbage. I really don't know how else to discribe this rag of a book. I will use it for fire knidling when the weather gets cold."
2,Just Not Very Good,"All hype, very little to offer. Just skip it. Believe me, you'll forget it in a day if you spend the time to read it. Too bad it is such a big bestseller....lowers the bar, in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and pick up a book by Anne Tyler or Alice Hoffman. Musch more rewarding then this trite book."
1,This book is horrible,This book is blashpeme. The author writes lies about Jesus Christ the Son of God and Savior of all mankind. I would not recommend this book. Instead read the Bible to know the truth about Jesus.
3,Same Formula,"A secret brotherhood, ancient history and art, a harvard professor of iconography called in to assist in a murder investigation, a beautiful & intelligent woman who is related to the murder victim helps him, a race against time to find clues to avoid something hugely disasterous, etc... this might all sound familiar if you have already read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS! He has used the same formula and simply substituted different details - too bad...it could have been so much better! It is shallow enough to make a great movie though as long as they cast French actors and not American pretending to be French..."
1,"A Dreadful, Dreadful Book","I picked up this book after hearing a lot of hype about it, and it proved once again that you should not believe everything you hear. While the book has an intriguing premise, it is one an altogether original one nor does Dan Brown make it very interesting. His characters are not very interesting, and they don't seem especially bright for people with supposedly ""brilliant minds"" (when the reader is a few chapters ahead of the characters in a suspence...things are pretty bad).All in all, this was a poorly written book with poorly drawn characters with a plot we've all read before. Find something else to read."
1,How did this book sell even 10 copies?,"This book is a masterpiece of poorly written scribble. I cannot understand how this book sold so many copies. The only guess I can venture is that American's watch too much tv and are unaware of any decent literature. I really can't understand what our schools must be teaching if this is what the American people find enjoyable. Brown has outdone himself in his shaky understanding of religion. I thought his physics and religion references in Angels and Demons were bad, but this is an insult to the intellect!"
4,A book that can make you feel like reading other books,"Actually ""The Da Vinci Code"" doesn't present new ideas, but clearly puts lots of research into it. I think it is a good book for those who has an ""open mind"" and for those who are curious about several themes such as mathematics, religion, symbolism and art.It is a book that can make you feel like read other books in order to discover what is fiction and what is real.I am a mechanical engineering and I liked to know a bit more about Leonardo da Vinci, Gallileo, Isaac Newton and so on.I recommended it to many people, including my girlfriend Paula Bianca Durigon, who is a very demanding economist and she liked it as well.After ""The Da Vinci Code"" I've read about 8 books more. All of them linked in some way with the first one.""The name of the Rose"", for instance, is a great book about similar ideas."
3,A Disappointing Read,"My friend had been raving about this book and said she couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to finish it so I could read it and discuss it with her. So I had great expectations that were quickly dashed. Starts out with a bang, and runs downhill. When I read a thriller, I want to be surprised at each turn, not screaming out the solutions pages before the characters arrive at them. There is not one single surprise here--well, OK, I wasn't positive about Fache's allegiance until near the end. It is just predictable and I wanted something more."
3,Pre-fabrication at its best,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I picked it up because it was suddenly cast as the absolute 'must-read' thriller of the decade! I enjoyed it for the most part, but quite honestly, I still can't see what all the hype is about! The storyline was definitely interesting and somewhat captivating, but the pages dragged on and the series of ""I'm glad you asked""-isms was a little too much. The story felt too carefully crafted and much like a cheesy Hollywood movie: Victims escaping in the nick of time, codes being correctly deciphered in conveniently placed moments of ""Aha!"" and a romantic ending that was only a little too expected!Bottom line - I'm glad to have read it so I can escape the accusing ""you haven't read it!"" glares of friends, but this isn't a book to lose any sleep over. The movie version is probably condensed enough to promote and maintain a greater sense of excitement."
1,Ridiculous,"How in God's name can a large albino man confined to wearing a monk outfit and bleeding from a torture device attached to his leg clandestinely attack people in a major city without getting caught? These and other stupefying questions will come to mind when reading this book. Furthermore:1) The use of French phrases throughout the book was unnecessary and pretentious.2) Could ANY police force be that incompetent?3) Could one, just ONE character been interesting (ok the Professor wasn't too bad).The combination of all this and other things really lost me. The book had little credibility just by how it was written (i.e. poor character development, implausible scenarios, predictable romance) leaving aside the controversy of the subject matter. Read another religious based best seller from 25 years ago instead: The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco."
1,Are you people kidding?,"You know a book is bad when you can put it down with only 10 pages left.Never again will I read a book just to see what all the fuss is about.The popularity of this book shows the devastating impact reality TV has had on the intellect of the masses.Most people will watch anything and read so little that books like this become best sellers.Seriously, that was terrible.Don't do it."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"I am not a religious person, so the religious content of this book did not offend me in the least. I am more appalled at the poor writing. The prose is clunky. The characters are bland. The situations they find themselves in are corny. And even I figured out the first anagram in 30 seconds...and anagrams are certainly not my strong suit.While I can certainly see the appeal in this breezy read, I can't understand the excitement. A whole week of specials devoted to it on National Geographic? Please.Do yourself a favour, borrow this from a library if you must, but don't waste your money on something you'll finish in a day and forget about in a week. Try doing some research on your own, you'll find it much more enjoyable."
1,How dumb are some people!,Dan Brown's book has not one grain of historical fact in it! Yet people are actually believing this stuff. It's all fiction. I also do not like the fact that the book continually bashes Catholics. If this book was saying all of the Quaran was wrong this book would not be read by anyone. Do not see this film. Or read this book!
1,A Disappointment,"I read this book before it generated such publicity. I had read Dan Brown's Angels & Demons, which I thought first rate. A pluse pounding, heart racing thriller. Because I enjoyed it so much, I purchased the Da Vinci Code. What a let down! It was no where near as well written or fast paced. If you get a choice to choose between these two books, please choose Angels & Demons. It is much better written."
1,"Dan Brown's Code, rather than Davinci!!!!!!","Read this book with caution and don't be misled.There is no Truth in this book, but keep it in the context of what it really is to be clasified...FICTION!! This book is repulsive in the way dan brown depicts history's facts, and distorts them completely out of color. Hope you take this token of my two cents, and don't waste your time with this book-"
1,Nilly Vanilly,"The characters are predictable one dimensional cartoons, the good guys are the atheist tree hugging narcissistic pagans, the bad guys include a very pale man who believes in God; the hedonistic oh-so-witty and sophisticated heroes manage to have the upper hand at every turn so there is zero suspense once you catch on to his technique. This book is just not very good fiction plain and simple. Pass on this [...]. Go waste your money on something [...] fattening, but please do not encourage the dumming down of the reading public."
2,"A must read, but for all the wrong reasons","I only started this book because of the hype, so I guess I did learn something. I found it almost impossible to put down as I continued to search out errors. Not as good as any of his other books."
5,Get Over It,"For anyone who doesn't rate this book 5 stars, get over it. I read the books months ago in the first printing and immediately told everyone I knew to read it. Its simply the most entertaining book of the year. Is it accurate? Not 100%, but then again Eco's works on the history of the church while far more tedious are not 100% accurate either. If anyone had bothered to read any other works by Brown they would know that being 100% accurate loses out to entertainment at times. This is a work of fiction. That means he made it up. As Gore Vidal says, you can do and say anything in fiction because its not real. If you want to battle through tedium (I have) read Eco, but don't beieve all of it. If you want entertainment read Brown. Read his other works too, but for God's sake don't begin to think this is hitorically accurate, its fiction!"
3,"All right, but not worth the hype!!!!","I am sure by now, you've heard of the novel THE DA VINCI CODE. If you are looking for a flurry of page-turning excitement, this is not it. I found this book to be immensely overrated. Still, I can see why some people would like it. The movie was horrid. I saw it this weekend and thought the book had to be better. The book was better, but it was still overly detailed and the character was flat and uninspiring. To give this book a letter grade, it would be a C+. Thank you for reading my review, LISA SCHUMER"
2,"Good, but over-hyped book","REVIEWED: The Da Vinci CodeWRITTEN BY: Dan BrownPUBLISHED: March, 2003An ""Okay"" book. It was good, but after hearing the hype over the years I expected a magnificent story when, as it turns, the writing was pretty standard. There are some great scenes that the movie portrayed but, overall, the story was actually downright formulaic and predictable. I knew who ""the Teacher"" and the pacing is a bit ridiculous. It's fun, entertaining, but not worthy of the critical praise it has received."
2,Not impressed,"Dan Brown succeeds in entwining historical data and hysterical myths. If you didn't know there was firm historical evidence for truth in history, you would think this guy was on to something. Sex as an underlying reason for all motivation instead of pure belief. Some will like it no doubt. Not me. I want a thriller with twists and turns and plots that make me catch my breath...this one made me grab my stomach..and I'm not even Catholic."
2,"An intriguing tale, but...","An intriguing story but the ending may lead to more than a few raised eyebrows. The author has a talent for writing and storytelling, but the book could have been a better read by eliminating the repititious and rather juvenile fascination with the female anatomy. It detracts from an otherwise well-written story and provides absolutely nothing for the either the plot or the puzzles. Because of that and because the fiction borders too close on the fantasy, I only gave it 2 stars. I'm glad I only borrowed the book instead of buying it and I probably won't bother to read his other publications."
2,Poor Echo of Eco,"Brown's conspiracy has been cribbed from the Illuminati Trilogy and Umberto Eco's masterpiece Foucault's Pendulum. If you're under 25, read the Illuminati -- it's not nobel material, but it will blow your mind. Eco on the otherhand needs no introduction -- he is one of the foremost writers of our generation, and Foucault's Pendulum is at once gripping, astoundingly well written and steeped in every historical conspiracy. By contrast, Brown is but a dilettante."
2,Robert Ludlum meets Tom Clancy,"I thought we'd all had enough of Jack Ryan (is he GOD by now?) in those paper thin cutout character clones that permeate Clancy's work. I also thought that we'd had enough of the mega conspiracy novels starring the (only millimeters thicker) Jason Bourne who seems to have identity crises without having an identity.Put this irregularly-paced (pacemaker required?) up against more thoughtful work by Le Carre or the brilliant Ian Rankin (Rebus) or even Michael Connely (Bosch) and it pales by comparison.The Da Vinci Code is shallow and pretentious, replete with leaps of untenable measure. It is uneven and unpolished as it moves from breathtaking (gasp) action through the doldrums of didactic lecturing and pseudo moral suasion.As with many works in this genre, it seems prepared for the inevitable Hollywood screenplay with fast-paced exciting (yawn) car chase scenes and cartoon-like characters.I'd rather spend an evening at the WWF thanks."
3,"an exciting read, but........","This book was definitely an exciting read, but I have to question many of the author's theories. I also felt that the characters were pretty one-dimensional and even unbelievable at times. The plot device of finding each clue and solving it got a little bit tedious at times. However, it was a quick and fun read."
4,Too bad I didn't finish it...,"This is definitely one of the greatest books I've ever read. It was so hard to put it down after starting it. But when I got about half-way thru it, I decided it was time for me to stop. Dan Brown is a brilliant man, but he needs to check his sources if he wants to slag the Catholic church like that. I've been a Caholic since I was a week old and it's a huge part of who I am. Most of the historical information presented in the book is false, but he seems to clearly state otherwise in the introduction. Opus Dei is real, but nothing like what happened in the book would ever happen in real life. I just find it deeply offensive that Dan Brown writes about another instance where the Catholic church is being humiliated, even though it is ficticious, in the midst of the sex-abuse scandal wew are facing right now. So overall, enjoy the story, but ignore the historical info."
3,Remember: This is FICTION,"Good plot. Easy, interesting read. However, keep in mind, that the ""facts"" presented here about Jesus are not new nor have they ever been proven. But that's the great thing about conspiracy theories isn't it? The lack of real evidence is only more proof of a cover-up!"
1,Drivel!,"Badly written, cardboard characters, completely unbelievable plot, nonsense. What more do you want?"
3,Great up until about midway.,"This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and by its midpoint, I was trying to veryify the information on the internet. A lot of what is in the book is based on fact, and a lot of it is speculation and then the rest is pure fiction. Still, it's a fun read and a good mystery. The reason for the 3 stars is that I thought Dan Brown chickened out toward the end and took the easy road out. The story is far-fetched in parts and I don't even mind that but he started with a certain premise and then abandoned it. I no longer understand why the priory is holding so dear the location of the grail. Who are they protecting it from????"
1,Not worth yout time,"If you are a real reader and like plots and characters you will be disappointed by this crap. Really lame characters and not much suspense. This is probably his second best book but I think they all pretty well suck. Very formulaic and not well done.I'd heard so much good about this book that I wasted money on a hardback, I gave the book away when I was done laughing at it."
3,Da Vinci Code,"Generally speaking, I don't read fiction. This book however has been hanging around as a top seller for so long that like others have said, I guess I too got sucked into it. I will say it was interesting, but there is one thing I am confused about. It's seems that the media and tons of readers are treating this book as if it were some documentary, or at minimal a ""non-fiction"" book. If you notice, this book is in the category of fiction. As fiction one should not believe or expect it to be factual. People do however think this is real stuff. I have mixed feelings about the way in which a fiction book, will surely be messing with the heads of many naive young (and old for that matter) readers.We can't really condemn the author however, because it is the reading public who has placed this book where it is. It did keep my interest from front to back thus achieving it's purpose of entertaining me. Just remember it's not real."
2,Overrated,This book is overrated. The characterizations are inconsistent and the plot is simplistic. Dan Brown is unable to develop any coherent ideas of his own. I wouldn't recommend reading it.
2,It is just not well written,"After all of the reviews I was expecting a good thriller to involve me. However, the writing style is just not that good. The author never misses a chance to let the reader (the ignorant masses, I suppose) know how much he, the author, knows ... about just about everything, turning the read into a plodding effort. Further, too many of the interior monologues are just downright sappy, which eventually renders the protagonist to a cartoon character status.Long and short, if you are well-read and with a wide reading interest, you are probably going to be bored fairly quickly."
5,Awesome!,"If you want a page turner, here ya go! I'm not a big reader but this had me riveted from start to finish. Very interesting and thought provoking!"
4,"A good read, very quick","Overall a good read, it goes by very quickly and can turn into a page turner. Unlike some other ""page turners"" this one does require the reader to pay close attention to figure out the case. Some of the aspects of the book were a bit of a let down as they were rather predictable, but probably seemed more so because of the unexpected twists and turns the Brown offers. A good book if you are on the road and want something to read at the airport."
2,Nothing is Sacred Anymore,"Since the time of creation humankind has searched in vain for answers to our earthly existence and fate beyond the grave. In the beginning, primitive societies worshipped rocks, the spirits of the dead, ridiculous deities and so on. In 2006 nothing has changed. We continue to contrive answers to eons old questions while allowing religious and literary opportunists to fill up their pockets on account of secular emptyheadedness.Humankind lacks the capacity to satisfy these questions, so we either choose to have faith in Divine Providence or fall prey to mind manipulators. The success of the Da Vinci Code is not due to literary or artistic merits but to people searching for answers in the wrong direction. Nothing is sacred anymore.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir."
3,Sadly could have been so much better,"Thank God it's not just me! I thought this book had a great premise, but was such an insult to the reader's intelligence. I felt like I was 17 again, reading a Sidney Sheldon novel. Dan Brown must think the average reader is a sheer idiot. He spends several pages at a time uncovering what are supposed to be clever plot twists (the tracking device in the bar of soap, the ""semitic"" writing that baffles the supposedly erudite characters). It's no fun reading a book when you're several pages ahead of the author. I put it down with 50 pages left and don't care what happened. Several hours wasted that I will never get back!"
1,Sorry son...,"Looking back, I could have spent quality time with my son rather than wasting it on this book (""son, sorry for snapping at you when you tried to tear one of the pages""). I was promised a thrilling end, but was disappointed, or frankly speaking cheated. What began as an interesting thriller, ended up in a series of ridiculous twists and turns. Don't waste your hard earned $$$ on the movie."
1,astonishingly mediocre,"Should anyone be surprised that a book with such a low level of artistry should be a runaway bestseller? Yes, I say. There are so many good books out there going unread while this junk enjoys astronomical sales. Go figure.How can anybody take seriously a conspiracy that implicates The Little Mermaid? And if they are not taking this seriously, but reading it for the great suspense, then maybe they ought to branch out into the genre. This is really really low level mystery writing.Having said that. I agree that it might make a good B grade movie. The kind that Spielberg had in mind when he made Raiders of the Lost Ark. As a screenplay it works. If screenplays are your idea of a good read, go for it."
1,Rubbish,This is a horribly researched book. Brown knows so little about Europe (and the UK in particular) that you have no confidence in anything else he is trying to sell with this novel. An awful read which will have you tearing your hair out at the mistakes.
1,It's just that: Hype.,"I read lots of different types of books, some written for braniacs and some not. This said, I might even consider myself semi-well-read. So take my opinion for what its worth:This book is so poorly written, I cannot imagine recommending it to anyone over the age of 15. I am 35, college-educated and even used to read Stephen King relatively energetically... but this book, whooooo.... its so bad. The story has lots of potential, even kind of a good story, the kind you could tell at a dinner party... but the way its written puts it on the shelf next to the Fabio-airbrushed covers of cheap romance pulp... if I still had it. Which I don't. Second hand shop around the corner has my copy."
2,"Dan ""The Fraud"" Brown","Dan Brown uses the research of others and passes it off as is own.This book is nothing but a murder mystery weeved into the Holy Grail myth already written in ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail."" That book came out 20 years ago! Brown makes no mention of this book in interviews nor is it featured on his own website, because it would hurt his own book's business.Someone called Brown a charlatan on one of the reviews. I think that sums up his characther very well. So he's getting rich off the work of Richard Leigh and others who put their life into research of the Grail and the Ancient Scrolls.The murder mystery is terrible and just shows that when Brown is not rehashing the research of others that he is incapable of fabricating a credible fictional plot or characthers.I give this book 2 stars only because its the kind of book to recommend to those who do not read and they will like. It also serves as an inspiration to others that ANYONE can write a bestseller."
3,Kind of like movie theatre popcorn...,"Da Vinci Code was much like movie popcorn. The many rave reviews tempted me, but ultimately the final product left me disappointed. It's a quick enough read and does touch on interesting topics. However, the `love story' is pedestrian at best. My biggest complaint is Brown compulsion to add in random factoid asides. Obviously Mr. Brown completed a significant amount of research, but at times it appears he just adds in non sequitur bits just to let us know he did his homework.You could do worse, but I'd say wait `til paperback and a long flight to pick this up."
1,I liked it when I read it the first time...,"The funny thing about Dan Brown's books: they are all the same. I read one and really enjoyed it, and then read another and thought ""Wow, it's like I'm re-reading the same book."" He is definitely a formula writer; he found something that worked for him and used it for everything else afterwards. It's almost as if he has a computer program that lets him substitute names, places, and circumstances, yet the events and timeline, even the relationship between the characters are exactly the same. This guy is a hack and an insult to every reader who has any sort of intelligence."
1,Slickly written but mean-spirited,"I was prepared to like this book because it was recommended by family and friends. It grabbed my attention immediately and was very exciting. The more I read, however, the more I didn't like what was written. As a Catholic, I just kept saying ""That can't be true!"" The claims of this being a well-researched book just struck me as wrong. I would recommend reading an article called ""Dismantling The Da Vinci Code"" by Sandra Miesel. It takes Mr. Brown's ""facts"" that sound so reasonable and documents why they aren't true. I love reading good fiction but I don't like it when fiction is presented as fact."
3,Two levels,"Like many here I read this book on the urgings of others. Eventually, I could only have so many people tell me what a great book this is before breaking down and reading it myself. Also, like many here, I found my enjoyment decreasing as I noticed an occasional error or strange interpretation of something I was familiar with. In terms of the history, I think the strongest thing I took away is the importance of having multiple sources, and always looking for bias on any issue where interpretation will account for a sizable amount of the research.As for the actual story, I thought it was fun. At times the author seemed to be pandering to the target demographic, but it's not common enough to cause too much annoyence. While certainly the characters are a bit cliche at times, and seem to often have their mental functions tied down so as to not outpace the reader, I still found them to be enjoyable. They're candy rather than a full meal, but sometimes one just wants some sugar and fun."
2,Naive and quite boring...,"I am not sure why it is so popular... probably just because some pseudo-scientific remarks regarding Catholic Faith. I could stand only half of it. If you are looking for a good suspense book, you will be better off with Frederick Forsyth."
5,Great book,"I love this book, Brown was able to bring in historical facts seemless into the story line. I enjoyed it alot."
4,Very enjoyable... just do your research!,"Many of the historical trivia in this book ARE fact, but there's also a lot of fiction. Unfortunately, Brown does not bother footnoting his book to point out which is fact and which is fabrication. That aside, this is a very good book with a nicely paced plot and cool details and trivia. I could not help but immensely enjoy this book as I read it several years ago. The movie is also rather decent, though I liked the book better."
1,lowest common denominator?,"i wanted to see what would make a bestseller - and now i know, appeals to the lowest common denominator. it is a somewhat entertaining book because i did not have to use much of my intellect. however, it insults the intelligence of many people especially in places where the author attempts to explain, e.g., how much $20 million euro is, who designed the pyramids at the Louvre, etc. but worse is the writing, the lack of character development and the interesting similarity in plot (and plot only) with umberto's foucault's pendulum, though the latter books is a masterpiece. so, if one is looking for an entertaining book on the plane, this might be an ok book. but if one is looking for intellectually honest book with superb writing, this will definitely disappoint you."
3,A fascinating subject,Mr Brown has really done some fantastic research and he raises some wonderfully perplexing questions about the Christian faith. I found that it made me study more on those questions and look up information about the Knights Templar and the gospel according to Thomas.The downside to this book was that it did not hold my attention as far as the story was concerned. I found it not up to par with many similar books.
