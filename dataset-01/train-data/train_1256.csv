1,Didn't work,I tried this on several machines to my TV with no avail. I just assume this is a load of crap. I was to lazy to return it so now I'm stuck with this 6FT cable around. Maybe I'll pretend to be Indiana Jones with it.
1,Didn't work for PS3 slim,Wouldn't work for trying to use Dell monitor with my PS3. Bought the identical cable from [...] and it works like a charm.
3,You get what you pay for,"It works as it's supposed to, but barely. The cable needs to be completely inserted and screwed in tightly into the DVI device to work at all. When I first connected it I thought it was DOA. The picture occasionally will ""glitch"" with colored lines although it's barely perceptible. Obviously not expecting much at this price but you're probably better served ordering something else if it's at all important. Also, the connectors look gold plated but clearly are not."
5,better than expected,this cord works as it should. i just plugged in and turned my computer on and up came the picture. i rate this cable a 5 0ut of 5.
4,works great,this cable is great for plugging a computer to a HD tv through HDMI. picture quality is perfect and is quite durable. i would not recommend using on an xbox360 to a computer screen through DVI because you will not have sound. DVI connectors only support HD video
1,Just didn't work,"I just got an ASUS 24"" widescreen monitor for my PC and ordered this cable to connect it. It just didn't work. I pushed it in all the way and screwed it in securely but still no picture. Got a DVI -DVI instead and it worked."
1,didnt work,Sony doesnt recomend these cables because they dont work.At least on my tv it didnt work.
1,you get what you paid for!!,"Cable caused sceen to flicker red after a few hours . Bought this cable based on review that it was as good as more expensive ones. Not sure if I recieved malfunctioning cable but after swapping out video card,ram and adding a fan to my computer found out it was the cable."
2,bought the wrong product but can't return because of the shipping price is more than the actual product,i don't no what its used for but certainly for what i hoped for. i thought i could connect my laptop and tv with this cord but doesn't fit my laptop thing. but i guess its overall good product just can't test it.
1,STILL WAITING .. ORDER THIS ON THE 12th,"Service on this order has been terrible. I ordered this on the 12th, and I'm still waiting.. Somebody dropped the ball on this one. I also ordered 8gb or ddr2, and a 1.5tb hard drive that I had to cancel thos items because they were never shipped.. Very poor service...."
2,not what i thought,"probably is a great product, but not what i thought it was. wasnt described well enough."
1,eforcity monkeys,"The chimps who work at Eforcity will manage to lose your order, send the wrong order, or send your order out within 8 weeks. If you purchase anything from this company you are gambeling."
4,"Good quality, good price, fast delivery.","Put simply - high quality at an excellent price.Product was delivered on-time, and was exactly as specified. I'm using them to connect several Acer quad-core boxes w/HDMI outputs to several AOC monitors with DVI-D inputs.Picture is perfect on all.Very satisfied."
5,Great cable for the price.,I have my 160GB PS3 slim hooked up to a ViewSonic VX2250WM led monitor using this cable... and it is perfect. HD content looks nice and sharp with it. Buy it now.
2,Defective,"Everything in this product is as advertised, but when I went over to my friends house with the cable and my computer, I was hoping I would be able to hook it up to his 1080P TV. I plugged the DVI end into my 9800GT and the other end into the TV, when I turned it on, nothing. I think the wire is defective, but with a price under a dollar, I really can't complain."
1,Wrong Cable,"I purchased this cable, and did NOT receive the cable pictured and described. Rather, the cable I received is HDMI-HDMI, male on both ends, but one end is a mini or micro (Type C or D) connector, and the other is a traditional Type A HDMI connector."
5,Don't pay full price for cables,This cable may not come with a 5 year warranty or be as well constructed as others that cost 10x its price. But then again i can buy 10 of these for the same price and I can guarantee you will never notice a difference in video quality. Mine is working great to go from my HP laptop to my LCD monitor (HDMI has less frame delay then VGA cable so i prefer using it this way).
2,"cable was fine, but costumer service was bad, really bad","It was kind of my fault i tried talking to them via e-mail they didn't really cared much for me, which is fine i made gthe mistake but they could have helped a little more, i needed a dsub dvi to hdmi, and they told me to explain it more and what not i did and they just didn't help me much after that so i had to go to [...] to find the right wire because they helped me so. over all i never had chance to try it, but i would never buy from this company again unless i absolutely had to!"
3,you get what you pay for,"it's super cheap, but the picture quality is OK. sometimes my external screen flickers off and on and sometimes causes the computer to crash, which isn't good obviously. i honestly don't have any other experience with HDMI cables but i'd think that higher end cables would have less of this issue. crashes don't happen very often and i paid less than a dollar for it, compared to $100+ for ""real quality"" ones, so i don't have much to complain."
1,You get what you pay for,"Let's just start by saying my expertise is relatively high. I should have known better. Cable never worked, DOA. Was so cheap it isn't even worth caring about return/refund. Ultimately you get what you pay for. Ordering this item will most likely cost you just under $5, some wasted time, and about $5 worth of frustration. Thanks, but I guess I'll give the new Amazon branded cables a run for their money."
4,affordable,"Good product considering the price. One of the tuning pegs would not stay, the string would never tighten completely. Within a week the peg broke while we were trying to get it to stay. However, we (the parents) are not experienced with violins and accept the possibility that we may not have been interpreting the directions correctly. Also, we did not attempt to contact the seller for a replacement, so I cannot comment on how they might respond to such a request. The remainder of the pegs work fine. The one major complaint I have is that the violin took a very long time to arrive; they did announce that there may be a delay, hopefully this was just a temporary problem."
3,More like an owner's brochure...,"This manual is much like the equivalent of a ""quick start"" guide if you were to purchase a new car or truck today. Covers basic issues on how to operate the tractor, but if you're looking for something to guide you through any more in depth maintenance issues, you should get the shop manual."
3,Informative but repetitive,"This clip is informative but repeats the same information a few times. It could elaborate more on the specific benefits of composting; i.e. compare foods grown with compost vs. no compost. Also, it would be useful to know what other alternatives are to composting: limited space for composting, or other equipment available for composting."
1,Worst money spent,"I can't believe the quality of this product not only did it break it leaked from the get go, the flap that actually diverts the exhaust blew out on me on the freeway no more then 2 weeks after install same happened to a friend who had his installed when I ordered mine."
5,I love this pan,"This is the best pan I have ever owned, and I've owned quite a few, mostly the ""non stick"" type that scratch and get all yucky in a short period of time. I bought this pan because of the price and when I received it I was amazed at what a beautiful pan it is. It's very substantial and heavy, which some people may find to be a drawback, but with the helper handle it's very easy to move even when it's full. It is excellent for browning meat and cleans up very easily and still looks like new even though I use it more than any other pan I own. I highly recommend this pan and plan on buying more Cuisinart."
1,Why bother,"This could have been a splendid collection had the company put a little more time and effort into making the prints viewable. I have purchased single copies of movies that Hitcock produced in the 1930s and none of them were as bad as the ones in this collection. My set of six CDs was produced by ""Osiris Entertainment"". Remember that name and avoid them at your video store."
1,More Madacy Entertainment trash...,Madacy appears to have quite a history of producing low quality transfers from film to DVD. All one needs to do is look at other Amazon reviews (look at some of the Charlie Chaplin DVD reviews). I was extemely disappointed with this DVD set and wished I could get back my money. It was a complete waste of money. We're lucky that Amazon has the ability to review these so others don't waste their hard-earned money also. Also fortunate that Amazon has technical info so we can see who has produced the DVD's.
1,DON'T ORDER THIS TERRIBLE PACKAGE OF GREAT MOVIES!,"Having seen all these superb Hitchcock films before, I was expecting to enjoy the wonder of DVD viewing to enhance the next times around. No go -- owing to poor encoding problems and horrible packaging from the producers (resulting in ALL of the discs coming off their spindles and perhaps being the culprit behing tiny surface scratches), only one of the pictures was even viewable. A gigantic waste of money. Go ahead and order if you must, but be prepared for the hassle of sending it right back to Amazon."
2,"Yes, but ....","I love Hitchcock, but .... The big disappointment in this set is that all of the movies look like they were copied from old videotapes -- they're out of focus and have an amazing number of dropouts, flashes, and flickers. Save your money. Tape them from late night cable."
2,"Good films, poor DVD","This DVD set is an insult to the great master like Hitchcook! Madacy should have put more efforts making this DVD set more watachable. DVD collectors are different than normal VHS reviewers. I will never buy any DVD from Madacy ever again! Hope someday, somene like Criterion will remaster these films."
1,Technical Difficulties,"The warnings given by other reviewers cannot be amplified enough -- I could not play any one of the five disks and had to return the package. For all I know, Madacy just stuck a bunch of blank disks in the package."
4,What a Great Set !,"This set of Alfred Hitchcock videos is superb.Most of the videos included are his older ones but they are still wonderful. The Lady Vanishes ,Young and Innocent,secret agent,and the 39 steps are my favorite videos in this collection of 10 tapes . They are true Alfred Hitchcocks . They keep you in suspence until the murderer or kidnapper etc. is revealed and caught. I would suggest that if you like Hitchcocks you should definetley get this set it is a must for any Alfred Hitchcock fan . Your collection won't be complete without it!"
2,"good movies, decent video, poor sound quality","The movie's in this series are very good and, in my opinion, worth owning. These early works are in themselves good movies but seeing them after seeing his later works you can see how Hitchcock formulated his ideas and used them again in his later works. The video quality of these movies is watchable but they are not letterboxed. The sound quality on some of them is really poor to the point that I had a hard time understanding some of the dialogue. The special features of the DVD are also not that great (eg. no subtiles)"
5,Common and Uncommon Sense on Not So Common Sense,"This is a truly remarkable book. It deals with the very difficult topic of how people judge the world around them. Unlike almost any other book on the topic, this book addresses both some of the philosophical issues involved and presents some very interesting empirical research. Amazingly it does all of this in a rather engaging, comprehensible way. I particularly liked the philosophical position presented in the Ch 2 and the annotated transcripts of indepth interviews presented in chapter 7."
5,Breathtaking Pictures with Recounting Memories,"I had a getaway to Big Sur last summer and was stunned by the breathtaking view of where the ocean meets the sky. About a few months later I picked up a copy of Big Sur to Big Basin at a local bookstore and began a virtual re-visit of Big Sur. Like many pictorials with pages of astonishing sunsets, Pamela Cain, a former Carmel resident, recounted anecdotes and memories of hers that make the photos alive. The redwoods, the beaches, cheery blossoms, the meandering streams, Pebble Beach golf courses, Monterey bay...Big Sur to Big Basin is your window to panoramic view in central Californian coast."
4,see for yourself...,"Big Sur to Big Basin is the only book I have experienced that fully portrays the feel of the area. Fantastic photography complements the books detailed narrative, and if there ever was a book to remember a visit to a region, then this is it.The California coast is a wonderful place to explore, and in particular, the Big Sur area is one of my favourites. From the mighty trees, to the wonder of the rugged coastline, there is something for everyone.Larry's photography leaves you thinking ""I have to see this for myself"". So we did. Twice now!Buy this book if you ever want to travel to the area. Buy this book also if you just want to experience the area without leaving your armchair. Most of all, have this book on your coffee table, and you will always have something to remember from a fabulous trip to a unique part of the world."
1,Wrong One,"I was sent The wrong tape. I was expecting ""Night Eyes "", the first one with Tanya Roberts."
5,"The next time I take an oath, I'm going to swear on this book","I'm a crim pro junkie, so this book is a cherished belonging. A good investment for anyone in a crim pro class, but a necessity for anyone who has to do any sort of self-guided crim pro research. And it's a steal at around $50."
4,Law textbook,"Book was great except the binding was a little unsteady, which is understandable since the book is so thick. Very little writing on the inside. Pages all flat, no bends."
3,OK Game,"There are some game to rent and some to buy. Dont buy this game before you rent it. Some people like it more than others. My friend got it and would of given it to me if he hadnt of paid 40 bucks for it. Personally I think it is ok.The Graphics are pretty good as is the sound; a little choppy on the Superpipe levels though.Unlike what the features up at the top of the screen say, you cant create your own boarder unless it a hidden thing I havn't discovered.There are 4 different mountains. Each mountain has several different events. There is Freestyle, Palmer X which is a race down the mountain, and Superpipe. On one of the mountains there is no super pipe and on two of the mountains Palmer x and Superpipe are rolled into one big bundle of fun.Its an ok game but I would rent it before you dish out the 40 dollars (this is the list, you may find it for less).--James"
4,Good GAme,This is a good game for features such as graphicsplayers and tricks. The bad part is its really hardim still on the first level. But there is awsome easy to dotricks. This game is a lot better than tony hawk 2. I reccomend this game to people who like snowboarding.
2,Missing something.,Let me preface my review by saying that I am NOT an avid game player and I am a new advance owner. This game has poor graphics in comparison to other advance games. The control in the game is reminiscent of the original GameBoy game 'Paperboy'. The single highlight of the game is the 'superpipe' course. I purchased this game because of snowboarding games I have played on other systems (i.e. SSX on PS2). This game falls very short of any other game in terms of playablility and entertainment. Forty dollars can be better spent elsewhere.
2,"FUN, if you like being borad!","This game is so borading that I feel asleep playing it. The one good this about the game is that you can play as Shawn Palmer, but other wise is borading. Don't throw away your money on this!"
1,REVIEW,REALLY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. WHAT UNION IS THIS FROM? iT'S NOT FROM NEIP. IT WAS ALRIGHT THOUGH.
1,K-Tel is K-Tel is K-Tel...,"Don't be fooled by which country K-Tel's CDs originate. If the K-Tel label is there, you have to expect re-recordings. And just because the artist/artists have been dead for decades, don't presume that the recordings will be the originals. What you get here, even though the CD is marketed as an ""import,"" is re-recordings of 35 of the 60 songs. Even most of the older ""oldies"" are re-recordings. Additionally, numerous of the 25 originals are unfamiliar versions (covers or album cuts) by familiar artists. This 3-CD set is basically a waste of money since you probably won't spend much time playing it. The rule of thumb should be: if the K-Tel label is on it, avoid it."
5,"Brilliant, creepy redneck B-52s southern-goth-electronica","Frightening alt-country with a heavy dose of Moog-synthesiser weirdness. Dowd's previous album, ""Pictures From Life's Other Side"" is an appealing mix of Hank Williams (Sr, of course) and a weary Rambo (Viet Nam is a heavy presence); this magnum opus is more William Faulkner meets the B-52s. Deeply troubling songs about misogyny, child abuse, racism and plain ol' violence are set against a backdrop of synth squiggles and blurps. The lyrics, which include a widow trapped by her husband's killer and an aging surfer on his deathbed, get under your skin in the best way.Kim Sherwood-Caso's pure, soaring voice adds effective counterpoint to Dowd's deadpan Okie drawl; it's a vocal combination to rival any of the classic bluegrass brother combos.I loaned this to a friend, who gave the best summation I can imagine: ""It's like they found some hidden knobs in the studio labeled DO NOT TOUCH, and they twisted the hell out of 'em."""
5,Sensational!,"Great hits such as ""Poll Man,"" ""Only Baloney"" and my favorite ""They'll Get You Babe"" make this CD stand out!"
1,Only large enough for a toddler...,This hat seems to be made for those aged 12 and under. This is not something an average adult can wear and was a complete disappointment.
2,Cook Lite,"I wish I had read the reviews before paying for this. The key word for this edition is ABRIDGED. According to the editor Philip Edward's introduction, only about a third of Cook's/Beaglehole's text is included."
2,A dry tedious read,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. When I saw it online, I thought that it looked interesting. The few reviews were favorable. I enjoy maritime tales, stories and life. I thought that pirates and life aboard ships were interesting decades ago.This was a slow, monotonous account. At least all that I could read for three days. Then I lost interest. I have read period pieces before. However the abbreviations and some of the words I just could not decipher.If you want to attempt to figure out this book, I wish you luck. If you do, maybe you could explain it to me. :)"
3,Count Basic sounds kinda basic.,Good sounds but its not much different from any other Acid Jazz you hear on a Jazz Station. If you are looking for something unique this is not it. But it is good for the average new age jazz listener
1,This is not acid jazz...,"Acid jazz walks a very fine line. On one side lies the funky, creamy goodness of Cinematic Orchestra, Funki Porcini, and Amon Tobin. On the other lies trite, easy-listening, grocery-store jazz fusion.Unfortunately, this album falls on the latter side. Seriously, listening to this disc makes me think of supermarket aisles full of Tide and cereal boxes, or sitting in the waiting room of my dentist's office, flipping through old copies of Newsweek. When soccer moms want to let loose, they put on a CD like this and break open a bottle of cheap domestic Chardonnay. It's strictly by-the-numbers lite jazz, with about as much authenticity as a Twinkie. It makes me cringe."
4,A Great Read,"Like lots of people these days, I'm busy. Get up, exercise, shower, get myself and the kids ready for work, go to work, get the kids......But somehow I finished this book in three days. It had been sitting on my shelf for months, waiting for me to succumb to the bait, and when I finally did I was definitely hooked. The story moves along briskly with well-drawn (almost like a comic book) characters, scenes of suspense, romance, humor, and mystery. The only thing holding me back from giving the book 5 stars is that there wasn't enough mystery. Too many key points were revealed early on, but I'll forgive the author and buy the next two in the series."
5,Wilson continues to intrigue me.,"This is the first book I've read in Mr. Wilson's Adversary Cycle. As a great lover of his medical thrillers (The Select, Sibs, Implant, etc.), I was still entralled with this storyline. It was difficult for me to get into the story in the beginning, but after a couple of chapters, the excitement began! This is an excellent horror story and I was imagining those demons right there with me as I read the book. I am anxiously looking forward to reading the ""sequel"", LEGACIES, when it comes out in paperback!"
5,Great read,"Now here is a very good book. Repairman Jack fixes things, not your leaky faucet but other things closer to the heart. Immediately I liked Jack. This book was nonstop page turning, I was eager to find out just what was the threat here and why old ladies were disappearing. As soon as I meet Gia and Vicky, I liked them too. The books keeps you hanging needing to read the next page. It's a great twist of dark fantasy and suspense. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. It's a keeper for my bookshelf."
4,I LOVE REPAIRMAN JACK!!!,"I bought this book because it is (supposedly...) the sequel to The Keep. Well, I don't see any connection.....but on the plus side, The Tomb is a rip-roaring action/horror novel that stands on it's own wonderfully well.The book tells the story of Repairman Jack, a sort-of urban mercenary/fixer, who is hired to recover the heirloom necklace of an old Indian matron. From there, the story rolls along briskly, encompassing indian mythology, ancient Bengali Demons, and ritual revenge.Repairman Jack himself is a true find; a very human, almost everyman character, who is a refreshing change from the typical superman-type characters you get in books like this. You actually WORRY about this guy.....I'm really looking forward to the rest of Wilson's repairman Jack books!"
4,An unlikely name,"I enjoy almost all of F. Paul Wilson's books. His writing is fast, fun, and always holds my attention to the last page. I was a little surprised that the title didn't describe the contents as much as I expected it to. I'll be back for more."
5,Great read!,Someone recommended this series to me and I'm so very glad they did! Repairman Jack is a wonderful character. It doesn't take long to become sucked into his world. I found myself rooting for this rather unusual hero and was unable to put it down until the last page was devoured! I'm off to get the other books in the series now!
1,Ridiculous plot . . .,"thought about not finishing book at 27% . . . then, again slmost stopped reading at 52% . . . finally, couldn't take the absurdity of the plot and clicked my Kindle to a new story.Wish I had never started reading this one. I love a good horror or mystery or supernatural tale. This one was awful.What's with sll the good reviews - my opinion of a book has nevrr been so divergent from the avrrage rating. The ""Repairman"" needed to stay home and fix this story's plot, instead of going out to chase those evil vampire/zombie/yeti creatures.Don't waste your time or money -it's just plsin BAD."
1,Puzzled...,"I bought this book because I enjoyed _The Keep_ a number of years ago, and the enthusiastic reviews I found on Amazon. I was puzzled that I found this book to be quite awful.Wilson's writing is clumbsy; his characterizations are one-dimensional (focusing on appearance, mostly); the characters' motiviations are muddled; the events in the story are not writen to be convincing or compelling. I read until page 110, hoping it might be a ""good"" bad novel, but it just got too embarrassing. Some readers might enjoy this book, having first set low expectations. I decided to spend my time elsewhere."
1,Pedestrian,Didn't raise a single scare with me. I had trouble concentrating on it. The second F. Paul Wilson book I have tried and I am determined it will be the last.
3,Silly Predictable Book that has Horrible Sequels,"A good premise that ends up as a Silly Monster book. Obviously Written for Teens, not scary, good guy wins."
5,Good book,"I read The Keep and I was hooked on F. Paul Wilson's work. I like The Keep better, but this is pretty darn good too."
5,Great,The RPJ series is a super line of novels that lead you to the end of the world as we know it. Or maybe not?This is a classic
5,quick rating on blades,These blades are of High quality and do a professional job. As far as Jigsaw blades go the progressor blades are fantastic for almost all cuts accept sharp curves. Obviously you need use the thinner blades to make sharp turns. The blades are more sturdy than a Home Depot special and do last quite a bit longer. Like any blade the better saw you put it in the better cut you will get.
5,Good value,"I bought this to cover a wide range of uses for a new Bosch jig saw. It's everything they say and I love how easy it is to change out the blades. This set will cover your needs for most anything casual DIY'ers need for a while and it comes in a nice case. The little flaps don't open really easy, but it is secure and will be my blade holder for ever, even after the provided blades have been used up."
1,More mold please,VERY POORLY MADE!DO NOT BUY!The bottom of these dishes aren't sealed so if they aren't completely dry they will begin to gather mold and smell. Had to throw these out after a year of use because of this.
2,Nice but too fragile,"We have owned these Pfaltzgraff Natoli pattern dishes for about 1 year but are now looking for a replacement. Orignally, we loved the colors and how heavy and thick the plates are. However, like many other reviews say, the plates and bowls chip very easily resulting in useless ugly dishes. We had chips on some plates within a few days - even though we were careful with the new plates. It is kind of sad because we have had other Pfaltzgraff patterns over the years that lasted a long time, even with young kids. We love the huge dinner plates although they are too large to fit in the dishwasher or microwave. The cups are very nice and have held up much better than the plates and bowls. I'm not sure what makes these chip so easily but it makes my leery of purchasing Pfaltzgraff again."
1,Pretty for about a year,"I wanted something durable.. yet pretty. My mother had ""Village"" and it still looks great. I had Winterberry for Christmas time and never had a problem either. So I thought I would buy Pfaltzgraff as well. I decided on Napoli. They now ALL 12 place settings have chips in them. I would NOT recommend these dishes to anyone! The chips are happening in the dishwasher! I have a brand new Maytag so it isn't the dishwasher. I have Henn Worshops stoneware and it doesn't chip in the dishwasher, nor has my Winterberry. My 11 year old son said to me ""mom, these dishes aren't worth the money you worked hard to pay for them"". Out of the mouth of babes.."
5,These dishes are beautiful!,"These dishes are absolutely gorgeous. They look a lot prettier in person than online. I was looking for something that was oversized, but not too ""girly girl."" These are perfect. However, like most others, they are too big to fit in my cupboards. I don't mind moving my kitchen around. I bought two sets. One set had a chipped bowl, but I called up Pfaltzgraff and are sending the replacement to me. No questions asked."
1,Beautiful but not durable,"As others have mentioned, these dishes chip very easily. Any contact with another dish can cause a chip. I've only had these dishes for about four years, but they look so bad that I'm thinking about replacing them."
1,Nice but dishes chip easily and paint chips off,"I purchased the entire set - dishes, serving platters, etc. My excitement quickly turned into disappointed within the month. The dishes chipped. I called the company and customer service claimed it was my fault. I should alternate the height of the dishes in the dishwasher so they don't bang together. First, I never had this issue and have had Mikasa, and other brands. None chipped. Anyhow I alternated the sizes as they suggested and they still chipped. Further, some of the serving bowls have some red enamal edge on them, and after TWO washes the paint flaked off. For this, I called again and they did replace that piece only. However, after repeated chipping of all my pieces and the expense, I am done. These dishes are not worth the money. I am embarrased to use these with guests."
1,"CHIPS, CRACKS AND BREAKS!","I have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have ALL chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well. I have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results. They say they are ""microwave safe"" but after the first few uses, the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand (or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest!) and the food/liquid inside stays cold. I am SO disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes."
1,Buyer beware,"A warning to those contemplating Pfaltzgraff Napoli dishes. Other reviewers are absolutely correct -- Napoli dishes can NOT be used functionally in the microwave...they get scalding hot (can't pick them up without potholders) while your food stays cold. It is also correct that they chip incredibly easily. I've never had a problem with any other dishes, yet 50% of mine are chipped after less than a year. As pretty as this pattern is, please don't waste your money. I'm already considering this investment a huge waste as these dishes have to be replaced already."
1,Terrible dishes,"I have had my Napoli dinnerware for less than a year and they are all chipped. I contacted Pfaltzgraff which did nothing. They also can not go in the microwave...they get really hot,food stays cold."
1,looks great - chips great,"I've had these dishes for 2 years. They look great, but they also chip up very easily. Too bad I bought the whole series before realizing this. They do not do well in the microwave as others below have stated. I will be buying a new set of dinner plates very soon. This was a poor long term investment."
1,Poor quality - DO NOT BUY PFALTZGRAFF NAPOLI,"We too bought the Pfaltzgraff Napoli dish set enough for 8 settings. Within a few months of simple use, they started to chip. We have a higher-end dishwasher and we separated the dishes (as the cust service rep recommended when we complained. After the complaint, they sent us some replacement dishes. I should have asked for the entire lot, because by the time the new ones got here, the other ones had chipped!) And believe me, we do take care of our stuff. But this was RIDICULOUS! The dishes are an embarrassment and we cannot even put them out with company. This, by the way, happened with the regular Napoli dinner dishes, the small bowls, and the milk dispenser. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
2,Overheats in Microwave,"I bought this set because it said it was ""Microwave Safe"". I don't know what this term means in respect to this set. After heating a cup of coffee up for only 30 seconds, it is untouchable and the coffee is still cold! The plates and bowls get too hot also to the point you have to use potholders after 30 seconds. I am thinking of returning them for safety reasons. Also, you try to put them in a dishwasher, the wierd sizes of everything do not fit properly. On the positive side, they look pretty."
1,Napoli Chips Dont Buy It!,"We purchased Pfaltzgraff Napoli Dinnerware over a year ago. It was the worst mistake we ever made. We have always had fpaltzgraff dinnerware and we loved it. But this Napoli is worthless, almost every plate and bowl has a chip in it. We never had this problem before. Call to Pfaltzgraff were met by them as too bad for you. We should have known something was wrong when we saw on the bottom of the dishes they were made in China. There is no qualty, it all just junk from China."
1,Pretty but fragile,"I purchased these because I loved the color and pattern. I thought that since it was Pfaltzgraff it would be of good quality. Wrong. Within a month, I had chips. I have no small children and they are supposed to be dishwasher safe so you tell me how that happened? I have dishware from 20 years ago that was used daily that I gave away because I wanted something new. Silly me. Only purchase this set if you want to display your dishes."
1,Class action law suit over napoli dishes,"I heard that there is a class action lawsuit going to be filed againxt Pfaltzgraff for the inferior quality of thier Napoli product. does anyone know if its true, I would like to join it. I bought two sets of this garbage last year and every plate and bowl is chipped. I have had dishes last for 20 years until I had to throw them out. Maybe its because its made in China"
1,Every comment about these being VERY EASILY CHIPPED ...IS SOOOO TRUE!,I couldn't believe it! I have never had a set of dishes that chip this easily. They are not dishwasher safe in this regard. I have had to NOT let my children use these for that reason. They will chip when you have a porcelain sink as well. I just ordered this set and they came to me chipped and now Amazon is Not crediting me back for the set I returned!But I am still working on this! What can I say?????Talk about problematic!
3,"Beautiful dishes, but I am noticing cracks","We received our Napoli dishes as a wedding gift in May 2006. They are absolutely beautiful and if the quality was great I would recommend them in a heartbeat but unfortunately that is not the case.Since we don't have a dishwasher, we wash them all by hand so I cannot attest to them not fitting in the dishwasher (although that is good to know). REVISED: we now have a dishwasher and these fit just fine in ours.We recently noticed a small chip off the edge of one of the large, heavy cereal bowls. They have not been dropped or anything while washing so I couldn't figure out where the chip came from. Also our plates are starting to ""crackle"" on the finish which I am assuming is from the microwave. This is extremely disappointing to me."
5,Beautiful and sturdy,This is one of my favorite dish sets. The dishes are not only beautiful to look at but are substantial in size. Like another reviewer though I did have trouble with the plates in my dishwasher. However I'm very happy with the set.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I had owned my Pfaltzgraff Folk Art pattern for 19 yrs- Yes, 19. They were a workhorse for my family and I loved them. Since I was certainly ready for a change I choose the lovely Napoli pattern. I was so happy with my Folk Art set - I knew I'd be thrilled with my new pattern.NO SUCH LUCK. My 9yr old says ""You can look at these dishes and they chip"" Out of the mouths of babes. I had expected a better quality with the Pfalzgraff name behind them. THEY ARE THE QUALITY OF THE DOLLAR STORE!Unfortunately, I sold my old dishes in a yard sale. Live and learn. I think I will look into some Fiesta Ware. AGAIN - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY- THEY'RE PRETTY FOR A SHORT WHILE."
1,Pretty but too fragile,"Buyer beware! Beautiful to look at but you can't actually USE it! Especially if you have kids. All are chipping. And Pfaltzgraff didn't stand behind this product for us. After a few months we called to complain and ask to exchange for another style, but we were basically told, ""Sorry, no exchange. Everybody knows stoneware chips, you should have selected a different material"". Um, what? That wasn't on your product description. This junk chips when you put it in the dishwasher and it bumps against another plate! So after barely a year, we will be throwing out a HUGE set that we purchased during a kitchen remodel."
3,Looks great,"Table looks great set in the Napoli dinnerware pattern. Overall, I really like the set. Only problem I've encountered is that the set is difficult to store. The plate diameter is larger than a standard kitchen cabinet and the bowls and mugs don't nest very well. Still glad I made the purchase."
2,Is this game possible?,"I rented this game, and naturally, I did not get a full set of instructions. That is the only excuse for why this game was nearly impossible. Sure, I could take the one run, go all over the mountain, do some inexplicably impossible stunts, and find cool things, but there was no physical way I could find to advance to the next mountain. When I had certain boarders, nearly any combination of buttons and/or stick moves would invariably result in exactly the same stunt. Only using Palmer himself seemed to change that aspect. I can only say thankfully it only cost me one rental."
1,READ THIS REVIEW,"Put tony hawk pro skater 3 and ssx tricky in a blender and you get, two broken games. Buy this game and you get, one broken game. I would like to tell all of you now that this is NOT tony hawk's pro skater on a snowboard. First of all, the graphics are about 1/9 as good as Tony Hawk's pro skater, which is pretty bad for a PS2 game. Secondly, the trick system is so terrible that neversoft should be ashamed. I played the demo of this game that came with THPS3, and turned it off after the first 2 minutes. I never played it again. Please, buy SSX tricky instead.I would also like to say that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a great game."
3,Bought this for my kids,"They played it for a while and then moved on to other games. They liked it while they had it - I thought it, like most video games was a waste of money. But the kids enjoyed it until they won consistently. Then they donated it to a local thrift shop."
5,Outstanding Receiver!,"I have been an audiophile for over 40 years. I think I know my stuff, and I KNOW I can tell a low distortion signal when I hear it.This receiver is awesome. The THD (.008%) is so low I can hardly hear any imperfection in music, even at high volumes. I am driving a pair of old Advents, and they sound terrific. (The fact that this receiver is stable with 4 ohm speakers is a big plus for me.)Rise time is fast (quick pulses of bass sound great), and high frequency response is awesome.I do not find it difficult to use at all. It has every input/output I want. It has lots of flexibility for routing signals, too.Can't say enough good things about this receiver. Glad I chose it."
4,Mind-Expanding,"Wasn't sure if this would be worth the money. Used it to power 4 rooms of home audio ceiling speakers with my computer as the source. Amazing sound, plenty of power. Found things in the music I had never heard before and couldn't stop listening to it. The interface is a bit clunky as others have noted."
3,Denon DRA-397 Refurbished Receiver,"The sound was very good but for some reason when I put my record player to the phono input it sounded horrible. When I switched it to another input it was great though. It is a simple devise as long as you only have simple requests, but the more complicated obviously you'll need to get help from the instruction manual. This unit stopped working on me (i think overheated) so It is now being fixed under warrantly since DakDepot is an authorized distributor... thank god. So in general, sounds good, read to manual for help, wierd phono reception, and if buying refurbished make sure to purchase from an authrorized dealer."
2,very unsatisfactory experience,"I concur with the previous reviewer that this is a difficult to use product. Nothing either in its design or in the confusing and unhelpful manual that accompanies it is at all user friendly. I had the thought that this product was designed by someone of sadistic bent for someone he/she didn't like. I still (3 months later) struggle to figure out how to perform basic functions. Also, regularly I have had to 're-initialize' the device simply because it stopped working correctly. The manual assures me that this is 'normal'.Stay away from this product!"
2,Constant problems,"I've had nothing but trouble with this receiver. At no time did all the features work, something was always malfunctioning. The remote and front panel seem to work at cross purposes, and the user manual is worthless. There are few functions still working and one of the channels appears to be out. Nothing but problems. Stay away from this one!"
1,Great Audio...Until It QUITS,"I have had my DRA-397 for just over two years and it always produced great sound....until it just died. It turns on but the audio input card has died and now it will cost more to fix it than I paid for the damn thing in the first place. Seveal friends told me that Denon makes top-notch audio components, but just as many said they make junk. I guess I got the DRA-397 that was dropped on the floor of the factory dusted off and shipped off. I will never again buy a Denon product!!!!!"
3,"Not 4-in-1, but 3-in-1","All I received were: One USB cable, One USB car charger, One USB travel charger. This is not 4-in-1, in my book this is 3-in-1.The One USB cable included in package is not retractable: it is just a simple cable."
4,Loud but cold,Very powerful and cools well. Pretty loud when you first turn it on (and I love white noise) so I'd recommend turning it on before you're ready for bed so it will be at the lower (and quieter) fan setting (if on auto) once room is cooler. I love the timer and remote control options. Easy to set up.
2,Not Impressed,"Amazon listed the item with free shipping, but in fact it wasn't free. I canceled my order and I'm still waiting for the refund 3 weeks later."
2,The description forgot to mention that you MUST drain the water,"I bought this AC unit during the excess heat wave this summer. The unit, (once properly vented) works really well for cooling my bed room but it shuts off when the water needs drained. Durning these hot temperatures this is after only 2-2.5 hrs. Draining the water is not an easy task because the drain is only 1 inch from the floor so you can only use a really really shallow dish. It does come with a hose to connect to a drain for continous drainage but the drain must be below or at the same level as the AC unit.This drainage problem makes the unit NOT useful for long term cooling (you can't run it all night or use it to cool while at work)As a long term solution I am working on buidling a stand to set the unit on for continous drainage into a bucket but it is heavey and vibration makes noise a problem. Other portable AC unit have a collecting bottle which is easy to revome for drainage."
1,Died less than 30 days after warranty expired,"My experience with a Supentown Portable AC Unit is very similar to what 'Thorion (Rome, NY)' reported. I purchased a WA-1200E in June 2006 and it died last week (end of June 2007). This unit was lightly used (less than 10 hours per week during warm months only) . I contacted their support staff and, although they were prompt to reply, they indicated that the unit was out of warranty and that nothing was covered. They gave me the option of shipping the unit (85 lbs) at my own expense back to their warehouse in CA. They would then determine what part(s) failed and charge me for the replacement parts, labor and return shipping. Their other suggestion / advice was to take it to a local repair shop of my choice and have them find out the problem...then order the replacement parts from them. Either way....TERRIBLE! For a costly unit like this it should last way longer than 12 1/2 months. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,emergency only not for real cooling,I'am a certified EPA HVAC Tech that chooses A/C and Electronics as a hobby only because I make more income by other means and the reason why I bought this unit is strickly as a backup means for hurricane aftermath. I ran last night to mimic hurricane scenario and was disappointed at performance keep in mind my room is 15X15= 225sq.ft. I purchased 12000 BTU unit should be kicking a** but doesn't :(PROSmobilityremote controlplug into any 120v outletremoves much hummidtyConsSomewhat noisey but acceptable just need to crank TV volumeDoesn't really drop temp much for size of roomRoom temp at start 78Deg will not drop lower than 75Deg sadBad performance if looking for permanent solution
5,Good book for all ages,"This book is wonderful, very realistic. Even if you do not like Barbie, you should read it. It is more about highschool life than about Barbie. And if you do like Barbie you should read it too. Everybody will enjoy this book :-)"
4,"This is fun, interesting,book!","I am 13 and I got this book when I bought the doll, Mari ( I know, I am a bit old for Barbies, but I feel Gen Girls are different.) Barbie meets some friends in this book and trys out for a commercial ( she is a actress). This book was exellent, but it seemed very short. I read lots of different books like Louisa May Alcott and Lillian Jackson Braun and I really like how this author writes. This is defanelly not junk reading! I wish my library had these books!!"
1,Dishonest Merchant,"This Merchant misrepresented what they were selling. I purchased the set of mats with the expectation that it would include all four mats - front and rear. The advertisement clearly indicated such and even had a picture of the rear mats.When I recieved only the front mats, I contacted the seller, who was defensive and told me that I simply needed to purchase the rear mats separately. They gave no explanation as to why they were advertising all four, yet not shipping them.BEWARE: This is a dishonest vendor. I recommend you purchase your mats elsewhere!"
2,"Not the worst, and not the best.","It will provide decent air if you don't mind all the racket. Don't bother trying to start it in the winter below 30, it will just trip breakers.I have had to use a torch to heat the block to get it running.I recently bought a makita mac2400 which is comparable in hp and capacity, accept its a few puonds heavier. The makita moves more air, starts in the cold, oh did i mention its WAY quieter too, you can actually hold a conversation next to it when running.It just has a newer design than this dated model, these emglo compressors have been around 20 plus years and they show their age next to the newer models.Makita MAC2400 Big Bore 2.5 HP Air Compressor"
2,Seems ok,"Not so sure about this unit. I spend alot of time making sure the hose does not melt on the motor. It is a horrible design. If I had seen this in person I would have never boughten it for that reason alone. Other than that, its a compressor, it blows air, nothing else you can say about it."
3,Doesn't match up to a Makita MAC2400,"I've had this DeWalt compressor for three years and have cussed it the last two years. It performs horribly when it's cold, takes a long time to fill with air and is fairly loud. I really didn't realize how much I hated it until I finally had enough and purchased a Makita MAC2400. It is twice the compressor, performs great when it's cold and is half as loud as the DeWalt. The Makita is a little heavier, but for only $20 more you get a much better compressor."
2,cold weather operation a problem,"I bought this compressor cause it was lighter than most with a good reputation, however being a carpenter and using it in all weathers in the northeast just doesnt work it wont start!!! had to buy an oilfree would not recommend it ."
4,top notch,Does everything I ask with air tools. Only diaappointment was one air port and no quick connect which I immediately remedied. Now there are two quick releases on a T. Fast recycle time and relatively quiet too.
3,Too weak,"Not enough air flow for most of my needs. Only buy for very light work. The air outlet is too close to the handle, had to change it around."
2,Now made in China,"This is my 3rd Emglo in 22 years. These compressors are the staple of the building and remodeling industry. My first was made before dewalt took over Emglo the old style blue and yellow. My second was made just after dewalt took over Emglo and is still running strong. I needed another compressor for a new site and thought I was getting a ""real"" Emglo and when I got this compressor it was made in China just like all the rest. The compressor is running fine at the moment but I bet the other 2 I have will outlast this Chinese made compressor. BTW if you don't want trouble with cold starts tripping electrical breakers just use 5w-40w mobil1 or for very cold areas 0w-20w mobil the later is for winter only. My best to all the old Emglo employees to bad your jobs are in China now....."
1,JUNK,"I have been a loyal DeWalt fan for the last 25 years. I might have got a lemon but it ran 5 times and quit, I mean quit,(yes it had oil in it). I purchased it off of Amazon and now I can't figure out how to return it. very disappointed!"
1,air compressor,I'm sure this will be a great compressor once we get the pressure switch fixed. We didn't even run it 2 hours total and this switch went out We called the local Dewalt dealer and they said to bring it on over and they will fix it for us as it is still under warranty.
2,Pumps air when it starts,"I have owned two of these compressors, using it to power tools used in our HVAC business. DeWalt bought out Emglo, which was an amazing compressor. Too bad the DeWalt isn't near the machine the Emglo was. Pros - This compressor does make a lot of air quickly. That's it. Cons - It won't start! Even on warm days, you have to ""play"" with it to get it to go, often tripping the overload or a breaker. On a cold day, it may never start until warmed, even using synthetic compressor oil. Once it goes, it will usually run for the day. Even plugged directly into a receptacle beside a panel, it won't go. It is also a noisy pump, not as noisy as some we've heard, but right up there. We won't be buying another."
3,"A beautiful and durable pan, but smaller than you think...","This pan has a really nice finish and is very handy since it can go into the dishwasher as well as the sink. When cooking, the pan surface tends to get VERY hot. The first few times that you use it, plan on taking some time playing around with the temperature on your stove, and if you don't have a dishwasher, scrubbing the scorch marks left on the surface. The handle tends to stay cool, but will get hot with prolonged cooking. The biggest drawback to this particular pan is the SIZE. Don't buy this particular size unless you live alone, and even then, don't think that you'll be able to use it often. It can be used primarily for scrambled eggs, warming tortillas, individual pancakes, and anything else that is small and doesn't produce or require grease. Due to the pan's size and tendency to get hot, grease splatters EVERYWHERE. And no, there isn't a lid. If I had to pick again, I would splurge and step up to a larger size."
1,Save your money,"I bought this sytem thinking it would at least provide some comfort from the Southern Cal heatwave we got durring the summer of 2006. Bottom line, IT DID NOT. The square footage of the top floor of our apartment is approximately 500 square feet. The largest temperature drop was from 91 degreees to 89 degrees at 9:00PM. Even sitting directly in front of the system's fan (approx 10 feet away) did little to cool one person, so forget about cooling a small room. Please look elsewhere if you want a room larger than a small closet cooled."
5,Great gloves,I purchased three gloves in different colors. They are very comfortable and the colors are nice. It would be even nicer if there were more colors since they are difficult to find.
1,My View,I looked this book over and it is yet another example of how inaccurate portrayals of the typical gay man are. Not one of his stories seemed believable.The author's style seems to be exploiting our gay community a bit too much.I am an openly gay police officer and was interviewed for this book. Perhaps my interview was too believable? Of course this is only my review.
2,Very humdrum,"Mr Woog's book lacks style and has... this big measure - ""coming out"". Coming out is an individual thing and personalities vary. Lives vary. Every interview was preoccupied with whether the guy was ""out"" or not. The problem was that the related stories showed no correlation with sexual status. The book was badly preoccupied with this one fact.Gay Men; Straight Jobs was a very poor attempt to interview a group of interesting men. Mr Woog seemed to have a set formula (a very poor formula at that) which he followed with each man he interviewed. The book provided little insight into the interviewed men's lives and provided a very dull read. There was no attempt by the author to tie threads of commonality or diversity between the different people. Life is not whether you are out or not; its how you lead your life which is important."
5,Great watch,I am a fan of Fossil watches. This is a good watch for daily use. The photo depics the product well.
2,Not the right pot for steaming!,"The pot is beautiful, the finish shiny. The pot itself is a nice weight and boiled water quickly. However, I bought this pot mainly to steam veggies. And I found out after one use that this pot is not for steaming. The lid is so light that the steam was pouring out from all around the lid. I had moisture all over the stove, the fan hood, the wall. What a mess.It's probably fine for ordinary cooking but in recipes where the lid needs to seal this is not your pot."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with [...]. I ordered floor mats for my Honda Civic (a super common car) and they're not even close to form fitted! They are shaped like they were designed to fit a totally different car. I called customer service, which was no easy job, and they were not helpful at all. They confirmed I did have the right mat number for my car, but when I repeatedly said these mats aren't even close, they couldn't care less. So now I am stuck eating the shipping both ways, basically it doesnt' even pay to return them.When looking at the website, they make it look like the mats are perfectly fit for the car. What a farce.Based on how I have been treated, all I can say is DO NOT BUY FROM WEATHERTECH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Does not taste healthy,"This one is too sweet and does not taste healthy. They make one with sunflower seeds which is much nicer, more filling, not as sweet."
2,Pan Warps at High Temperatures,"This pan looks nice, but it does not have a flat bottom, and it warps significantly when used at the 400-500 degree roasting temperatures often recommended by Julia Child and Barbara Kafka."
3,Product does not match description,"Received my Cuisinart 9 x 13 pan and found it to be only 2 inches deep and not four inches as described. It also does not have a copper sandwich in the bottom. It is a nice pan, but not what was described on the Amazon web page."
4,Gee Buddy lighten up!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I refer to the one star reviewer who can ""play circles"" arround Charles Gayle.Now I have to admit I only like a bit of the Late Coltrane/Ayler outside style in general and have heard some Sax led stuff by Mr.Gayle and somethat is to out.But this is an off beat love letter to one of the forerunners of the ""New Thing"" (along with Mingus,Ra etc).But this idefitely listen able and different than the usual playing.I doubt it's for lack out a more fluid technique (which is kind of a oxymoron when applied to Monk but some pull it off well).But I liked this inside/outside because I have some many Monk CD's and Lp's where they are too smooth or try to capture something that cannot be captured the angular style with it's spaces that only Monk could really do.This is nice one when you want something familiar done differently.CheersChazz"
1,thumbs down,This game is worse than any game i've ever played. The graphics are horrible and the controls are impsossible to use. if i could i'd only give this game 1/2 a star but i can't. I've tryed selling it to every game store and friend i know of. I've even put it on ebay but nobody will buy it. If you do get this game you might as well let your dog chew on it cause that's all it's good for
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIKE REALISTIC RACING GAMES,this game has poor graphics and weak options!...do not buy!! (...)
4,Good stable platform for small business,Stable platform for small business use. Much more well suited to small business than Server 2012. Users do not have relearn how to use the server!
4,A Refreshing Burst Of World Beats,"I am not a big fan of dance music, most of which is faceless, generic, and uninteresting beyond the dancefloor. But here, Fiamma Fumana make it exciting and interesting by combining their dancebeats with traditional instrumentation such as accordians, fiddles and bagpipes. The mix works, also because of Fiamma's own unique voice and the melodies that she weaves throughout.Tre Sorelle is the standout, but this album contains much more to love, such as 1.0, Di Madre in Figlia, Mareoceano, and the giddy, infectious L.I.L.T.If someone who didn't know a thing about this Italian group (or its language) were to hear the songs for the first time, they would bet money this was a group from Ireland or Scotland, as F.F.'s roots in that style of music are strong here.All in all, its a fun album, a refreshing burst of beats and hooks that should delight all who hear it."
5,"Amazing show filled with thrills, adventures & inspirations","An 'amazing' show that has more exotic locations than a James Bond movie. The numbers of 'hard to believe' scenarios, real emotions and pains that the contestants endured will keep audiences on their seats from day one to the finishing line. We have so much funs and laughs watching them racing around the world that we felt like being part of the game. Love the first season of this show. A true credit to reality show. Can't wait to get the other seasons too."
2,Multiple,The preceeding star ratings tell all the story that I am in the mood to expond upon at this time.
3,???,"I would like to review this product and I was excited to order, it, but sadly I Dont know , I never got it. Post office lost my package"
3,Good... not the best season,"Bill and Joe annoy me so much!! I don't know why they annoy me. But they do! I loved it when they were about 24 hours behind in the finale. They still thought they could win. Ha! My favorite team is Nancy and Emliy. I thought Nancy was sweet, and Emliy was cute. Their worst decison was trying to find a car in a detour or take the subway. They chose to take a cab after hours of searching for the car. At the pit stop, they were 4th to arrive before only Bill and Joe. But then Phil Keoghan pulled both teams aside to tell everybody about Nancy and Emily's penalty of 24 hours. They were elimanaited and Bill and Joe stayed."
3,"Terrific series, but lose the talk-over!!","When I bought DVD set, I was looking forward the great presentation that I had seen on TV. We would crank up the dynamic opening music at the beginning of each episode, with the jet flowing through the clouds - it was a goose-bump opening to every action-packed episode. But what a disppointment on the DVD's. Phil Keoghan talks over the opening music!! Instead of cranking it up, I found myself turning the volume down. I already know it's ""the most daring competition ever attempted"" - most exciting, too. That's why I bought the DVD set. But having the Keoghan talkover at the beginning of each episode was a real disappointment.Otherwise the DVD's are great, with extra footage, etc. I give the content 5 stars, but the opening to each episode 0 stars."
1,Sadly lacking,"This could have been an excellent map book, but there are no inserts for cities. Not even New Orleans has a decent close-up and the rest are left out altogether. I've never travelled without at least having to go through a city and the majority of the time my trip is to a city. The free state maps given at welcome centers did a better job than this."
5,Amazing,"I have searched for this CD for nearly 1 1/2 years, and I finallyu found it...This album is incredible, it kinda makes me wonder why this never made it ANY further than it went... same with thier other rare album called ""Stuck"".If you find this album, you MUST get it; it is INCREDIBLY rare.Good luck,Christian..."
1,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE - BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWARE. THE ALBUM ABOVE, AND THE REVIEWS ARE ABOUT A RARE STUDIO ALBUM. THE DISC THAT ONE SELLER IS TRYING TO SELL FOR $125 IS A LIVE BOOTLEG. THE LIVE BOOTLEG MIGHT BE WORTH $30 - $40. I HAVE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THIS INFORMATION TO THE SELLER AND IT IS STILL BEING ADVERTISED AND THE SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND TO MY E-MAILS. BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!"
3,"not bad but get ""stuck""","Puddle of Mudd finally made it big... they may seem like a new band, but they have been around a while. I got a copy of ""stuck"", their first album about eight years ago. It quickly became a favorite. It was produced in Lawrence , Kansas. Huh?? It does rock though. Abrasive is decent but it is a let down if you hear stuck. Their first release from the new album the song ""Control"" sounds more like ""stuck"", then Abrasive. I don't know where to get ""stuck"" or if it is even available anymore, but if you can find a copy, jump on it."
2,Tall tales and boasting,"This is not a typical true crime book and not what I was expecting. It is written mostly in the 1st person from the killer's point of view. Graphic details of the killings and uncorroborated accounts of the victim's final moments. Offers some insight into the mind of a serial killer who exhibited the classic signs of animal abuse and arson, and may have been beaten by his father. The killer seems to have a better life in prison than he did on the outside, and seems to very much enjoy his celebrity status (as well as being co-author of this book). Little information presented about the investigation of the crimes, the evidence that was used to convict him, etc. Mostly just the killer boasting about what he did (in great detail) and how he managed to avoid the death penalty.Overall very distasteful and not much of value here. I recommend skipping this one."
3,Interesting Perspective,"I enjoyed this book as it was written in a style you don't often see, the words of the killer himself. Although quite self serving, I still found it a fascinating look into the mind of a madman."
2,depravity for voyeurs,"I couldn't even get through a fourth of this. This documents the ugly thinking and wicked acts of a very demented individual. Those who think snuff is cool idea would probably get off on this. I think the problem lies in the killer's point of view context. I have found other volumes on serial killers fascinating such as Bernard Headley's excellent ""The Atlanta Youth Murders and the Politics of Race,"" as well as more bubblegum fare such as Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me."" I believe serial killers are interesting subject matter, but something this insane is better served by someone outside the psychopath's twisted field of vision. But hey, I guess some people get off on sadism and wickedness."
2,portrait of a character disorder,"It is a little hard to understand why Jack olsen would waste his time and talents on this guy, Keith Jesperson. Trying to understand makes a killer tick is always interesting on some level, but Jesperson is so full of narcissistic baloney it gets tiresome. Not much insight here."
1,I: The Creation of a Serial Killer,Extremely distasteful slant; after reading my copy I took it to the dump rather than giving to another reader. It may have been meant to show the depravity of the killer but it absolutely sickened me and I sincerely wish I'd never purchased it.
2,Poorly produced product,Two of the DVD's in the complete second season did not work - came out of the package defective. I was not pleased.
5,Great collection,Great collection. I recently introduced my wife to this show and she loves it as much as I do. So much of it can be related to our often inept military proceedures. Hope amazon makes a habit of carrying these older TV shows.
4,lots of fun and special features,Another volume of inspired 60's sitcom comedy featuring the gang from Hogan's Heroes.As always it is a lot of fun although I prefer Helga to Hilda.The special features particularly the Jello/dream-whip bit is very good. The various skits from shows are very good.Howard Caine and Nina Talbot begin their regular visits as well. I forgot how nice looking she was in the early shows.Very much worth the money and the wait.
5,Brilliant Hogan!,"These episodes stand the test of time both in quality picture and second to none comedy. Hogan plays off Colonel Klink brilliantly, so funny when Hogan asks whose running this camp me or you Hogan, sometimes I wonder."
5,Simple and effective.,"Yes, they are simple and effective in maintaining an airtight seal on your foods. They might take an extra second to put on, compared to the other clips, but it's well worth it in the end. They lock freshness in."
3,Expensive,"Works on bags but you really need to push hard to place inner rod. Comparing these rods to bag clips, I'd say that these rods form a tighter seal; however, with clips you can fold over several times and just clip for a reasonably tight seal that is easier to accomplish. For such a simply designed product I feel it is rather expensive."
2,Don't Reccommended,The product does not work as shown in the photo unless the bag is very thin because the rod needs room to fit in to the other piece. With a thicker bag it doesn't fit. I even tried A bag as thick as Kettle Chips.
3,so-so!,"During the Regency, many members of the Ton sated theirpersonal pleasures at the cost of the estates. Perhaps the mosthedonistic is ""Awful"" August Coltrane....WAITING FOR YOUis an entertaining Regency romance that leaves some gaps inunderstanding for the reader to accept. The story line centers on thereactions to the actions of Awful, but his motives seem extreme evenfor a wastrel like him. Why have an heir or accept a ward, if he onlyplans to destroy the estate? Still, Kasey Michaels is such a goodtalent that having the lead charcaters rotate waiting for one anotherfeels like a fresh plot device. Though not her best tale, Ms. Michaelsspins a narrative that will still delight Regency romancereaders. ...END"
2,chicana lives and criminal justice,very long and boring at first. It talks about stats in the beginning and is very wordy. interesting book but long read.
2,I burn everything!,"I've not been happy with the Cuisinart fry pans. They need more oil or butter to keep from sticking and get too hot, despite my attempts to lower the heat when using them. The sauce pans are great however, easy to clean and they stay good looking. There are much better pans on the market at a better price."
5,Perfect,"A year or two ago, I bought this book not unlike the others here ... as a skeptic. But I figured, I liked Soul Catcher, so maybe this would be good to do as well.The questions posed in this book really hit home. They really opened me up to the possibility of love (after a truly horrendous break-up, I didn't think it was in my future ever again). So I feverishly filled out as much as I could. Throughout the year, I picked it up every once in a while & made some adjustments/additions.Earlier this year, I re-met a man (I had met him a year earlier, but only corresponded briefly). Nine months later, we're completely head over heels for one another. I recently reviewed my answers in this book & every last thing I had written that I wanted in a mate had personified itself in this man.Now I'm not saying that this will happen with anyone who fills out this book, but at the very least, it will open you up to the possibility.Good luck in love!"
4,Captures a world long gone,"While a mediocre mystery, Slicky Boys is first-rate sociology. No other author, journalist or academic has captured with such authenticity and even-handedness the world of a US Army base town in South Korea in the 1970s, when 19 year-old GIs were the biggest spenders in the country. Limon catalogs the prejudices, virtues and vices of both Americans and Koreans. More importantly, he carefully observes how their mutually-exploitative alliance plays itself out on a personal level."
4,I was surprised...,"One of the more original books that I have read lately, it is nice to have characters that are not sugar-coated. Recommend"
3,It moves along but seem flat at times.,"Plot was interesting, and author knows Korea, but too many dull sections"
4,Another fine Cross product,"This is an eye catching design that is both retro and modern. The pen has a good weight and balance. The only draw back is the chrome is a little slippery to hold, but I am growing used to the pen. A very good value."
4,Striking pen,"I have this pen for a month and am very pleased with it. It writes well like all other Cross refill. The pen has a striking design and the clip is flushed into the top. It took me a little while to realized that the clip existed and was afraid to force it open. It is definitely necessary if you move about a lot. It slipped out of my pocket on a few times and no damage to the pen. The center where the top and bottom meet is a little loose giving it a slight cheap plastic feel. It could be built sturdier. I have not have any functional problem with it. For the price, it is beautiful pen to look and write with."
1,Not a treat,"Looking at this pen, one could be forgiven for assuming that it is as functional as it is beautiful. I like working with a thick pen, and this does fill the bill in the regard. However, it is a slippery pen that is somewhat hard to grasp. But the fatal flaw for me is the lack of a clip. From the photo, there is the impression that this pen could be clipped into your shirt pocket. But no.. that is simply a design element. This pen fell out of my pocket so many times that I eventually left it at home. If Cross wants to make a smooth pen without any clip, that is up to them. But the ""faux"" clip was misleading and makes this pen unusable for me."
2,Fell apart,"Good eye catching pen, writes good, but will fall apart in several months. No heavy duty use, regular use and caring for it, but it will fall apart in several months......"
2,"Severe vignetting, and these are video lenses","Note - these comments only apply to use on a Kodak P880 digital camera.The supplied lens adapter tube acts like an extension tube and causes severe vignetting. Zooming out enough to eliminate vignetting gives you a narrower angle of view than not using the adapter/lens at all. I couldn't get the supplied adapters to mount the wide angle lens at all. These are also video grade lenses, which don't necessarily have the resolving power needed by a high megapixel digital camera, due to the difference between the needs of video and still photography. With that said, these are pretty inexpensive lenses, so you get what you pay for."
2,Not for me,I bought this for my husband who is a professional drummer. He flipped through a few pages and set it aside - he was totally uninterested in it.
5,E-book Delight,"I loved this book. It grabs your attention from the beginning and the story moves right along. I liked the way she made it more real by using historical events and people in her plot. I also loved the way she filled out Luke and Skye you really feel as if you know them before you finish. It is one of those books you can't wait to see what happens next but you don't want to finish because you like the people. I will buy her next E-book, ""Once Upon a Dream"", that has just been released. I am looking forward to enjoying that also. Hopefully more new Authors and our old time favorites will start going to e-books also along with the regular paper, tapes and disks. I love books and each medium comes in handy to keep me reading."
1,Not a very good Selection of Songs,This years WOW Gospel 2005 is not nearly at the level of any of the other years. Some songs are very old and the playlist does not have a good variety. I hope they do better next year. This is not what I expected.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this CD and was quite disappointed after listening to it. I enjoyed maybe 6 songs and there are 30 songs. CD #1 was just ok, but CD #2 wasn't good at all. I hope 2006 will be better."
3,Good Stuff,"I'm enjoying the CD. I do think, though, that it is largely a compilation of not-the-best-tracks on the individual albums. For example, ""The Prayer"" from Donnie McClurkin's ""Again"" album is not the greatest song...why didn't they use ""Again"",""Holy"" or ""Walking (In Authority)?"" Also, the first Fred Hammond song was a let down. That is not his best song. But they did add Vicki Yohe's ""Because of Who You Are."" It reminds me of all other ""Best Of"" type of albums -- I always feel that some really great song was left off the compilation. I guess if this CD had only all the top singles, then no one would buy the individual albums. It's still worth it, though. You know all these songs, so you probably won't be disappointed."
2,Songs not as good as previous years,This double disc collection contains very few songs that would come close to the material produced in previous years. WOW Gospel 2000 and 2001 still contain the best songs in my opinion.
4,Inspirational,I listen to it everyday in my car and never tire of it. Keeps me going and inspires me thru the day.
4,Not weak and shallow,"For the home studio, this package is quite enough. Alesis provides great quality products both for amateurs and professional. I've used a lot of Alesis products inside professional recording studios, which were excellent; and when it comes with their nano devices, they also deliver the goods. The nanoverb is an industry classic that started with another classic - the midiverb back in the late 80s. Get this model if you have a home recording studio. You won't regret it."
2,At The Paladium [DEAD],"Often live performances have a spontaneity that marks them abovestudio recordings, but after hearing Ray Anthony's band recordedin modern sound, this one is a dud. Great songs,good arrangements, but the sound is so bad by comparisonit's hard to overlook.I know, I should have listened to the samples instead of goingby the review that said the sound was good. I guess good meansyou can't hear the pops and crackle from the disk becausethey've transcribed it through a distorted doughnut.Try ""Dream Dancing II"" for the very best or try ""In the MillerMood"" (not Miller II) for the second best with a little moreupbeat tempo.I wish Amazon would post the actual recording date insteadof when the CD was released. It would give onea real clue as to what to expect from the sound."
2,"Excellent Illustrations, Barely Adequate Text","The author is one of those fellows who writes a lot and researches very little. In the case of this book, since he was serving in the reserve forces in the period covered and had access to good photos this book is of some use. The illustrator does excellent work but as far as I know, being a Brit, has no first hand knowledge of the subjects he does. In other words, good sources, good illustrations. Or to use the computer terms--GIGO. This book is fine if you want a bunch of pictures to trace for a school project and the teacher is as ignorant as the pupil is of what should be."
1,TOTAL MISMATCH For 9 Qt. Cuisinar,"This so called pasta insert is a full 3 inches shallower that the 9 qt. Cuisinart pot! Cooking long pasta is a joke ( too shallow ) and ANYTHING cooked with this combo requires much more energy because the food is so far from the bottom of the pot. Worse still, the volume of food cooked in it is reduced greatly, rendering the insert useless for volume cooking. A WASTE OF MONEY. MY true rating is ZERO STARS!!!"
1,NO STARS,The insert stinks. It does not utilize the full contents of the 9 qt. stock pot and does not cook all pasta properly because not all types of pasta fit into the pot.
3,not the best reference for interior designers,I found a handful of pages out of this book useful for space planning. Not worth fifty bucks unless you are designing equipment and products.
3,"Great book, Awful CD","The book is great. Information is presented clearly and is easy to find.HOWEVER, I had really expected more from the CD. It DOES NOT CONTAIN DEMO SOFTWARE for a version of ERGOFORMS, it contains a couple of cad files generated by that program. Unfortunately, they are not particularly useful ones. (VELLUM, DXF and DWG files for a 7 year old child, 1% male, and 1% female.) As another reviewer points out, the CD is basically an advertisement.If you want to buy this book for the info in the book, that's fine; it's a great book. If you are buying it because you think that there is something useful on the CD, I would suggest that you are making a mistake."
2,Slim pickins',"This ""book"" is 141 pages from cover to cover and is essentially a cut and paste job from technical manuals and advertisments. The pictures are common to those found easily on the Internet. It must have taken the author a good weekend to compile. About a third is devoted to ""The Thing"". If you want a more substantial book on the Kubelwagen get the one by Piekalkiewicz."
3,poor images,This book has a very large section on the after model Kubelwagon called The Thing. I mainly wanted to know about the kubelwagon and perhaps a bit about the post war version but this was too much. The images reproduced were very low quality. The book mainly was cut and pasted tests from old studies of captured vehicales. Very little from actual soldier users. Mostly reviews from US and British testers. Otherwise and intereting book with excellent tech data. I was looking for more human stories of which was very lacking.
5,"A Unique, Intoxicating Mixed Album","Months ago, I purchased Liam Howlett's 'Dirtchamber Sessions vol.1', and have since been searching for continuous DJ mixes of equal or greater caliber. Aside from a few pearls here and there(i.e. the Chemical Brothers 'Brothers Gonna Work it Out'), the search has not had much luck. My luck changed, though, when I came across this album the other day, and knew immediatly that I must have it. This album, once I began listening to it, completely shattered any expectations I had previously held for a techno album. This is one of the few CDs I've purchased lately that I am TRULY happy with. 'Hello Friends' is by far my favorite work from Dangers yet, and (in my humble opinion) should be what other dj mixes are compared to in the future."
5,Would have been a great stocking stuffer!,"Must have been living under a rock. Never heard of ""Tino Corp."" until recently (the Tino Dub series dates back to '98.) Regardless, this is excellent (albeit different) stuff, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone who enjoys MBM. As someone noted in the reviews below, this is a mix CD picking up bits n' pieces from the other Tino Corp releases (Tino Dub series, Bo Square & DHS.)"
2,Whatever happened to Jack Dangers?,A few years ago the man could do no wrong. Everything he touched was great. MBM material and his remixes were so inventive and engaging. But this stuff is boring and pointless. It meanders without a direction. Some of the really dubby stuff has that old spark (and some of these aren't even done by Dangers) but nothing leaves an impression. I know this is a mix CD but nothing on this would get me dancing-maybe head nodding. Maybe if I was in a club and this was on I'd be really happy but at home it's kinda annoying. Maybe Jack should have a steak.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is written for those who know nothing about marketing. It's nothing more than basic marketing tactics backed with useless hype and embellished stories to further promote super-ego maniac, Tom Feltenstein."
2,Not Orthodox,"While this author makes his case for ecumenism at the cost of Orthodoxy, his proof texts from the scriptures and the Holy Fathers are taking out of context and actually speak against this new teaching he is putting forth in his work. I would avoid this book totally."
4,Kristin Could Make Commercial Jingles Sound Like Art!,"Let me start by saying that I am spiritual but not religious, so I approached this CD with a sense of trepidation. But when I heard Kristen sing ""Poor, Wayfaring Stranger"" and ""Taylor, the Latte Boy"" on A&E's ""Breakfast with the Arts"" I knew I had to buy it. I was not disappointed! ""Borrowed Angels,"" composer Diane Warren's contribution to this CD, is proof that a good singer can make a song better than it probably is. Very few can do this--Judy, Barbra, Audra McDondald. Though I've never seen Kristin live, I own most of her recordings and she never disappoints! Kristin could sing anything and elevate it to high art. Buy this CD!"
4,As She Is,"Kristin Chenoweth has released a compelling album, so different from her first that it only proves her distinct versatility as an artist. Her glorious voice soars on more classical renditions of ""Joyful, Joyful"" and ""Just As I Am,"" and she effortlessly slips into a light country on ""Borrowed Angels,"" ""The Song Remembers When,"" and ""There Will Never Be Another."" She has an easy, simple pop styling on ""Taylor, The Latte Boy"" and ""Word of God Speak."" ""Because He Lives"" and ""Poor Wayfaring Stranger"" are my favorites on the album. Wonderful arrangements of fantastic songs, performed by the most masterful singer of her generation. Definitely worth buying!"
5,Voice of an angel,"The purity of this voice will blow you away. No extra help with electronics, it's all her."
3,This is NOT the Kristin I love!,"I love Kristin Chenoweth's singing style on all of the Broadway albums I have heard, but this c.d. is so totally different. I have no problem with Christian music but I felt like the songs didn't showcase her voice at all. They were all mellow, slow .. boring. Best song on the whole album is Taylor the Latte Boy. At least the fun is back in her voice on that one. Wouldn't recommend this c.d."
2,Kristin Chenoweth,"Love her voice. It was a bit preachie for me. Also, there was something in the way it was produced I didn't find appealing (style not content). I have heard her sing before, and would still look for music by Kristin in the future."
4,"splendid, simply splendid","Kristin chenoweth, an amazing singer, does an excellent job on this cd.There is only one problem for me, though. These songs ARE very Cheno, but the way I listen to them, I don't hear Kristin at all... I hear more of, well, someone else. The time i really think ""oh, that's kristin singing"" in in taylor, which i've loved forever.This cd is much more ""Kristi Dawn"" than ""Kristin""If you like the music, I'd buy it."
2,"Should be re-named ""CHRISTIAN CHENOWITH""","Though Kristin Chenowith is a remarkable talent, the overly ""inspirational"" theme of this album left me cold. Only a few cuts including ""The Song Remembers When"", and ""Taylor, the Latte Boy"" were enjoyable to my more secular ear."
4,An angel's voice not only singing of angels,A lot of comments have been made of the religious tone of this album and initially that put me off but Kristin's voice was too tempting a draw so I got it anyway. Yes there are religious songs but if that deters you at all don't let it. All the songs are beautifully sung. I could say I would love anything that Kristin sang but these are beautifully written songs which are worth experiencing. I love that she actually sings sighs and that I can tell when she is smiling during a song. Quite litterally her voice feels like home.
3,If you were expecting Broadway,"You will be disappointed.There is no trace of a Broadway Baby anywhere on this CD.I guess it is proof that Kristin has star power thata sophmore CD release is made of her personal choices.I like it, for what it is. A CD of inspirational tunes.Vocally,Kristin is as always,gorgeous.But, for a CD of inspirational lyrics, I just don't ""hear"" it in her performance.The last song, included for us die-hards, Taylor the latte boy[so much fun to hear live in concert] is as jarring as the sound of an espresso machine whenin queue with the serious songs on the cd.I doubt thatthis album is going to be played down to the grooves likeI have Kristin's ""Let Yourself Go"".This particular CD is one you must experience yourself.Because the alchemy of ""As I AM"" is going to depend ""soul""ly on the listener."
2,You gotta love the voice but. . .,"Chenoweth is one of my favorite singers. Seen her in everything she's done on Broadway. Own her first CD. You gotta love the voice but buying an CD also includes actually wanting to listen to the songs. When she announced a new CD at her Carnegie Hall concert, I was expecting somthing different, and this is certainly something different. The fact that -- as one of my fellow reviewers noted -- Chenoweth announced her intentions to do a Christian gospel-like CD, does nothing to improve the collection of actual songs which have a ton of reverb added. The final ""Latte"" song seems as if it were added at the last moment just to hold out hope listeners like myself that there' still hope that Chenoweth can come up with a CD that you'll actually want to listen to more than once! Ah well, maybe next time."
4,Very Entertaining,"Had been reading and watching Kristin for the last few months, was surprised that she had a singing carreer also. Ordered the album, and was pleasantly surprised how well she sang. This album is a good collection of christian and pop music.Am planning to purchase her other albums.Good Work, Kristin!"
2,Great voice bad musical choices.,"I always enjoyed Kristin Chenoweth and when I had the luck to experience her live at a charity concert I was hooked for life. She told us about her new ""spiritual"" C.D. but told us it wouldn't be full of ""Jesus Songs"" as she called it. I don't have a problem with Christian themed music. Some of the greatest music ever written was on Christian thought. Kristin unfortunately fell into the ""Contemporary Christian"" trap of syrupy cliche. I wouldn't have been pleased if she had just retreaded her last c.d. either. Her voice is what redeams this recording and I respect her artistry to explore new themes in her music as opposed to simply singing a variation on a theme. The song ""Talylor The Latte Boy"" which feals tacked on as the last track is funny and showcases her fantastic comic timing. I'll run right out and get whatever she releases but this recording will not be in hi rotation for me."
4,Good Cd of hope,Kristin has a very nice voice all most of the song's on this cd are good.This is good for anyone that wants postive music.
3,As I Am,"A nice treat for lovers of Kristin Chenoweth, although you wont hear her typical powerhouse musical vocals. A different style for her."
1,Bad Buy,"When using the additional adapter there's a high pitch sound that comes through the radio. But, all the time, no matter what, there is always static and bad sound quality. I've gone through all the stations possible! Crap purchase"
5,Works Great.,This works exactly as advertised. Works great. Stays in the dash charge receptacle with no problems. The tuner works great. It will even over power another FM station so you can use one of your stereo presets if you want to.
2,dioesn't work,"No matter what channel I place it, I always hear static.I bought this to listen to MP3 files, but gave it up.I'll either listen to CDs or burn CDs for MP3."
4,"good, not the best though","nice lil device.but it does make my speakers sound blown...led light for the stations goes in and out at random times, very sporatic, but doesnt effect the soundother than that, i use it every day for 4+ hours while drivingi would like to have a more quality one if i ever buy one again,would prefer one with no lights (the blue is too bright)dont regret the purchase, but i wish it sounded better - good enough for a work truck, would not fly for my own truck, but my truck has bluetoothjudging by how it sounds, i would not use it for any stereo thats amplified - stock stereo sounds rough enough"
4,Fantastic Product,Excellent Product.Started working as soon as i plugged it in.Generally any FM transmitor has issues but this one has no issues so far and i want to order one more for my wife.Have been using FM transmittors on android and Iphone last few years and this one works the best for my iphone.They could have improved the design and how it looks in general but otherwise simple to use and try out.
5,Great product,No problems at all. The sound is great with no static. Easy to use. I recommend for any cell phone or mp3.
2,Coby CA-745,"First, thanks to all that reviewed this product.I knew that I may have issues but took the risk.Thanks to Ralph Long ""Rocky"" for his review. He was right on the money.There was static when moving it around but when there was no static I was very satisfied. To fix the static and enhance the quality, I took it to a friend and asked him to replace the end and re-solder all connections. He heated and sucked the old solder out and then hot soldered it.After that it was perfect.Coby has a good product but garbage quality at the factory. Time to bring back the work to the US."
2,Has short in cable,"I bought two of these (one returned) because of a short in the wire. Just touch it and a loud crackling sound, seems to be a manufacturing defect. Other than that it's a simple unit that does the job."
4,awesome!,"this car transmitter works just great! i love that you can still plug other items into your car charger - so while there's a down-side to this not charging your iPod, you can still plug in an iPod car charger into the port if needed.the quality is great - there is occasional static on podcasts, but not enough where you can't tune it out. there's been no interference, the channels go below 89 FM, and for the price, it's perfect!"
5,Exceeded expectations,"With how much people dislike FM Transmitters, I was skeptical at first. Having owned a Coby product before, I put my trust in them for my first step into the muddy FM transmitter waters.This product works great. It just simply does the job. It's clear, it's static-free and is so simple to use. I can't fathom how some people can't get this to work. It must be their car radio. I have mine set on a popular radio station in Detroit and it overides the signal with no loss in quality.This product is worth more than it sells for."
4,"Overall, good product. Exceeds performance compared to cost","Title pretty much says it all. I've had this transmitter for roughly 1 mth and am pleased with the performance. As you may or may not already know, an FM modulator is a last resort when it comes to connectivity options. The sound quality is nowhere near that of a cassette adaptor or direct line/aux input.I have used several FM transmitters and this is one of the better performers. Changing broadcast station is very easy and overall reception is good. I live in and have used this in a major metropolitan area- in the rare case of interference, simply changing solves the problem. For the cost, this modulator can not be beat."
5,"Works Great, easy to use","Works great, live just outside of Boston sounds great, try to keep the coiled wire from moving too much it causes static."
1,Dissappointed.....,"I was hoping this will be a good one due to the reviews i saw before i purchase this transmitter. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit in my car charger socket. The head is too big to fit in. I am using a Honda Accord 2006 and was suprise this doesn't go well with the socket. The head now had some scratches and i cannot use it even in my friends car.Useless !!! Waahhhhh...."
1,"worked, but quickly died","It worked for 1 month, then turned dead with no sound, no lights.Called Coby, I was told that I need to pay shipping both ways."
1,AWFUL! Don't waste your money or time.,"I bought this because of the peoples reviews, saying that it has good sound quality and no static. As soon as I plugged this thing into my car and iPod, all I heard was static. I tryed many different radio stations, but they were all static. It gets worse if you even touch the ipod to change songs, it gets really scratchy. I never got just clear music. It sucks badly, don't even waste your money."
2,Dissapointed,"I chose this transmitter because of the price and decent reviews. I have to keep my player rested on the middle console of the car, be very careful not to move the player when it is connected, and mute the stereo when not in use. Otherwise, this horribly loud noise comes through the speakers when the cord is moved. It sounds similar to the sound of someone blowing into a microphone. Maybe I received a defective one I don't know. Otherwise the sound is ok, not great. I have to turn up the volume on both the player and the stereo quite a bit. If i forget to turn either of them back down before using individually it's a deafening surprise. My husband has the iriver AFT 100 and he loves it. Spend the money and get a decent one the first time!"
2,Regular,"Referente a la sintonización funciona bien pero cuando se trata de la señal, la misma no se pierde pero se le mete todo el ruido producido por el motor. En algunos casos es muy bajo dicho ruido pero en otros es muy alto. Lo probamos en un viaje largo y a los 40 minutos decidimos desconectarlo por lo que comente anteriormente. Quizas pueda ser un buen producto para tenerlo en casa y mandarle la señal al equipo de sonido pero en el carro deja mucho que desear."
2,did not work in my car,"The power adapter did not work in my car, a 2005 camry. It worked fine in my wife's car, a sienna. I think the plug is to long. No power - No good. needs work."
3,"Great while it lasted, which was not very long","This is a cool device. When working, it worked great. Nice display, and since you can plug other things into it, its not using up the charger. And you can adjust which station its set to, in case there already is a station at that spot. We bought this for use on a sailboat. Unfortunately, it shorted out after only a couple of days. We bought it because it was cheaper than renting one from the sailing company. And I will probably buy it again for our next sailing trip, mainly because I don't know if it was the device that failed or if the boat's electrical panel (which was slightly problematic) caused it to fail."
1,Stopped working!,"After about 5 months, it has stopped working. When it worked, it worked great, but now it doesn't work at all... dissapointing"
1,craptastic,This thing sucks more than the girls working on Hunt's Point. Static out the whazoo. Do not bother with this piece of garbage.
2,breaks after a week,"I bouught it for a road trip and it worked the whole trip. But a week later, it started losing connection with the plug. So now I have to play with the plug to get it to work. Nevertheless I just listen to the radio."
3,Good... For Awhile,"I got this about 6 1/2 months ago for my birthday, and it worked great. I had static maybe once, and it sounded better than a CD. I used it at least twice every day, taking it out of my cigarette lighter every time (so it wouldn't get stolen) and putting it with my CDs. In the past 2-3 days, it broke. Any bump in the road will make it slide out of the cigarette lighter just enough so it wouldn't work. The cigarette lighter doesn't feel any different, so I'm reasonably sure it's the transmitter. There's a short in the cord as well. So this is a great product... for as long as it lasts."
4,performs as described,performs as described. this is all I was looking for. a con would be that it is a bit large.
4,Good buy,"Works as its should. Good sound no interference. One small thing, in my car I had to manually tune the radio, using seek didn't pick up the station."
1,Coby CA-745,"I purchased the Coby CA-745 after reading positive reviews... Mine was not so good, the transmitter seemed to work okay but the cable that plugs into the mp3 player/device was bad. The slightest movement caused the device to cut out. In my opinion this thing is made of poor quality. Your better of getting a Monster 300 for the extra couple of bucks and better quality."
2,The adapter barrel is too long - that's why it blinks off!,"Bought this today at my local Hastings, taking it back tomorrow for only one reason... the barrel on the adapter is too long and it doesn't stay firmly connected in the 12V or cigarette lighter socket. I have two cars (Honda Civic, Toyota Prius), and spring blades on the sides of the barrel that are supposed to press against the inside of the socket don't go in far enough and it doesn't maintain a firm connection - I think that's why so many people complain that it blinks off.So Caveat Emptor - it may simply be the luck of the draw if it fits your 12V socket or not... maybe domestic or European cars have deeper sockets. However, I can't drive down the highway holding it in the socket to maintain a connection. The sound is great when it works, but odds are it may not work for you."
1,"Great, while it worked...","i purchased this item about a month ago and i was surprised by the audio quality it transmitted. unfortunately after about a week it stopped recieving power and would turn off intermittently. now it doesnt turn on at all. i suspect the metal contacts along the nect are not reaching where they have to on the inside, but i wont be buying another one of these again"
2,Terrible Sound Quality,"Not CD quality. Not even standard FM radio quality. Fuzzy, weak signal, and volume dips when bass kicks in.Do not recommend."
2,"VERY DISAPPOINTING, PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS",I purchased the Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Transmitter for use with my Ipod while driving. Unfortunately I never got much use out of it because it was plagued with problems. The unit looks nice but never sounded good. I tried switching to many different frequencies but the static was still there. My car has a rooftop antenna so maybe that is part of the problem. I think it might work better if your antenna is on the front of your car so the signal doesn't have to go through the roof. Also if you touch the cord while in use the static would get much worse. The sun also caused it to crack in several different places after only a couple of weeks. If you are looking for a wireless transmitter then I wouldn't recommend this one.
2,Failed too fast,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this to listen to my mp3 player in my car. It was a difficult choice, because some FM Transmitters seem to get bad reviews. I'm glad I chose this one, because it has worked perfectly for me. No static. Very easy to configure. Five stars.UPDATED REVIEW: After using it about 20 times over 10 months (and when it wasn't used, it sat safely in my glove compartment), it now makes a horrible static sound anytime the wire shakes, which means anytime the car goes over a slight bump. It's pretty worthless now. Two stars."
3,"ok, I guess...","Bang for the buck is there, just had higher hopes with all of the positive reviews. Likes to lose reception during my favorite Gov't Mule songs. I also found that it does not like to recreate bass all that well. I guess I should break down and buy a new stereo with an input jack. I can't complain much because the price is right. It's cool because it glows blue at night, but so do Smurfs. I would recommend this to someone who only plans on using it for a little bit- if you are looking for something that'll last a few years, pay a few dollars more and you can find one that takes batteries also, making it a hell of a lot more versatile."
2,sound was good while it lasted,"sound quality was great in my Ford Ranger, but it died shortly after recieving it and i dont know whats wrong with it. Already checked the fuse and its still good so its something internally inside the unit. It would be a little nicer if it had an on off switch for vehicles that keep the cigarrette lighter powered on even when the vehicle is off"
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"Great product!My first FM transmitter. I used it in my Toyota Camry with my Sansa e260 mp3 player in a suburb: Worked fantastically!Static or interference was rare.I love the range of stations: made it easy to find an available one.Sound came in perfectly clear!The only con is that it doesn't charge my mp3 player...but, with a universal headphone jack plug, I can't expect it to, so not that big of a deal.Got it in the mail just yesterday, so I wouldn't know much about durability. But as far as I know, this is great!"
1,"Sorry, have to agree it's junk","Very disappointed, I just bought this on March 24th and the connections that go in the cigarette lighter already seem to be worn out. The slightest bump in the road and your music will cut out. Tried checking the internal workings but nothing seems to fix it."
1,Worthless junk,"I should have known that the low price might relate to its performance. The thing worked every now and again, before I smashed it to pieces at a busy intersection. Pay the money and get something good. It's just hard to find out the information anywhere on the web. anybody got any ideas..."
3,The Tallest Giant Among Midgets,"Probably 5 ***** for an FM transmitter but 3 *** because of the technology. It's seems the best at what it does for an FM transmitter device. I do get some hiss especially in the city but I don't have channel separation issues wherein you hear channel cross-talk. That makes it better than the Belkin I initially used. For 18 USD it's a good deal, again, for what it is and the limits of the technology. Any more money would be unjustified. My next best options were 1) Do Nothing (no mp3 connection); 2) pony up $800+ to get an AUX jack. For now this works fine when i really need to hear mp3. i bought this from amazon and had to wait several weeks as they advertised. I did not have any issues with cosmetics as noted by some others."
1,I got a dead one.,"I got one of these as a gift. It was dead on arrival. It doesn't transmit on any FM frequency. It never worked.The Colby warranty says you can send it back with a receipt (but it was a gift so I don't have one) and $6, after you visit their website and call their support service,Buying this product appears to be a matter of luck; if you get one that works it's a good deal. IF you get a dead one, you've just bought a headache. Who wants to spend time on the phone trying to get a refund? Is your time worth it?I wouldn't buy this if I was you."
2,Would not recommend,"The product worked alright for a about two months and then began literally falling apart. When it did work it was always static-filled sound and never fully clear. Would probably be better suited for a VERY rural area with little radio interference.But this product is the cheapest for what it is. I however, would recommend buying a more expensive and higher quality transmitter as its what i did finally after using this product"
5,Excellent,"I have a Sirius radio in my car, the built in transmitter was not strong enough to listen to, so you constantly had to keep finding Fm frequencies that were not being used. I live in the NY City area and that's difficult and annoying to do. I bought this unit because of all the good reviews and the price was right. I have to say I was very impressed with the signal strength and quality of the sound.This unit will allow you to use 87.7mhz which is never used by anyone. Excellent product!"
5,Works perfectly,I read a lot of reviews of FM transmitters and bought this based on my research. I'm very happy with my decision. The sound is perfect and I've experienced no interference or static while driving around all over the place. I haven't had any problems except for once when I didn't plug in the headphone jack all the way. Highly recommended.
5,Hasn't failed yet,"Forgot to write this review after I first purchased it. I used this in an airplane to send my MP3 to a dedicated frequency, then retransmitted over a UHF frequency for all to enjoy (for the FCC Bubbas...I was overseas and flying an aircraft flagged to another country). I still use it today. The signal was strong enough for my wife to enjoy in another vehicle as we caravanned across the country."
1,Broke after two months,The Transmitter had a problem connecting with my MP3 player from day one. It had to be secured with a rubber band to stay connected (I have an Ipod Touch and Sansa MP3 player and it had the same issue with both. After two months it stopped working altogether. I plug it in and nothing happens. The company would not accept the return since it is over 30 days.
1,complete garbage,"bought this because it was cheaper than many other fm modulators and had overall positive reviews. my expectations were realistic. i know it wont sound as good as a direct connection or axillary port but I didnt want to buy a whole new radio so i got this instead.it worked fine for about 15 minutes before the lcd screen failed, making it impossible to change the station and try to fine one that wasn't completely static-y. since we had just started a 6 hour road trip we ended up stopping at walmart and buying an overpriced belkin product that worked well enough for the duration of the trip. this garbage is on its way back to amazon."
1,Excellent reception,"An order of magnitude better than the Belkin transmitters. My car radio actually receives the signal.It still has very low volume and distortion though. You need to turn the player and radio volumes way up.[edit: Lowered my rating. Decided to try using it once more, but the volume is just way too low. Not usable.]"
2,Item defective after 3 days of use,"The Transmitter performed well in sending the signal to my radio. It completely drowned out any radio interference. The sound quality was OK, but I'd recommend the Monster Transmitter for a richer sound even though the Coby transmitter sends out a stronger signal.My problem is that the Coby died after 3 days. Part of its appeal is that you can plug another device into its Cigarette Lighter Adapter. When I plugged an air compressor in the socket to fill my tires, it blew out the Coby transmitter which won't even power on.Since it was still under warranty, I could send it back to Coby if I include a money order to cover shipment. This annoys me. Why do I have to pay even more for a defective product? I'll eat the shipping cost to return it, but Coby should eat the shipping cost to replace it.In any event, I bought the Monster transmitter which is performing better IMHO."
1,Died 4 months in,"Great transceiver but mine died about 4 months into use. It could've been caused by cold that we normally get in the Northeast.. but either way, I now have a dead transmitter."
3,Great for the time it worked.,"I bought this because I have an older model car that doesn't have a place to connect my mp3 player. I had checked the reviews on here and most of them seemed to be glowing with nothing but praise. And for a while, the Coby wireless FM transmitter lived up to all of those expectations. The sound was clear, and I never heard any static. But inexplicably, after 3 months of using it on a regular basis, my FM transmitter won't stay in place with the cigarette holder. I can have the car be completely still but it will ""pop out"", rendering it completely useless. I'm giving it 3 stars because the quality of the product was exemplary before it decided to conk out on me."
2,Work for a an hour...,"I was very excited about this product because of the great price and good reviews. When I revived the item I plugged it in and it worked great. It had some static but, overall the sound was good. After about an hour when I tried using it again it would turn on for a second and the turn off. Tried it in different ports and cars and same problem. Very Disappointing in this product. I sent it for an exchange and I'll see if it works..."
5,Love It!!,"I bought this product because other FM transmitters I've tried had horrible sound quality and couldn't pick up 87.9 (which is the only available station in my area). But this did get 87.9 and has excellent CD-quality sound. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and i love it, no complaints :)UPDATE: It's been a couple of years since I bought this first transmitter and it was still working great, that is, until it was stolen out of my car. So I bought another one just like it, and the first one was definitely not a fluke, this one works just as awesome. Thanks Coby!"
2,Awesome until it stopped working,"This transmitter worked brilliantly at first. Definitely one of the best FM transmitters I've ever used. But after just a few months of use, it got all crackly and would only work if I jiggled the cable. Eventually, the crackling got completely overpowering and I would consider it unusable. :-("
4,So Far So Good,"I've used this in combination with a Sansa Clip player. I've been happy with the quality and performance so far. It makes my 45 minute one way commute more bearable. Nice to have my tunes along! I have found that I do have to crank up volume on the Clip, and my car stereo to get the sound I'm looking for, but it's not too big a deal for me. I do appreciate the fact that I can plug another device in while I'm listening. That's a nice feature."
5,works wonderfully,"Does what it's supposed to - very easy to use, and sounds great.I've been using mine now for over 2 years and just bought one for my dad."
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had two of this brand and one of another brand.Pros:- You can set the transmitter to any frequency. It covers all FM frequencies.- Price; it's pretty cheap.- Easy to use.- Fairly strong signal.- Decent sound quality.Cons:- After just a few days, some of the wiring started to have problems and caused static in the transmission. Any small movement of the player would cause it and sometimes it would become louder than the mp3 player. This occurred on both.- The metal parts that insert into the cigarette lighter started to break off after 3 months. This means it didn't stay in very well and would often power off if not at the correct angle.- It completely stopped working after about 18 months.So, the basic summary is that it's cheap and works ok, but it's fairly low quality and doesn't last very long. However, it lasted longer than a more expensive model I bought six months ago. Be prepared to hear a lot of static."
1,Scratches. Turns off by itself. Not working.,"The product I got had scratches on its surface, which made me guess it might have been returned by another user. In addition, when I plugged this into the cigar port, it just turned off by itself after one to several seconds. It worked for a few minutes once when I was very lucky, the first time and the last time as well. Even it is working (I used 88.7 MHz), the sound from radio heard very far and the sound quality was lower than I expected. I returned this product."
4,Best FM Transmitter I've Tried,"I've had experience with 4 different brands/models of these, and this one is by far the best. Strong clear signal. The only negative is the oversized iPod-like control panel. For something that you mostly set and forget, it is really overkill.Still, I highly recommend this product-it is reasonably priced and works perfectly."
5,Better than expected!!,"I couldn't believe how easy this was to use. It literally took me 30 seconds to set up. Plug it into the car charger, the default on the Coby was 108; my radio went up to 107.9, switched to transmitter to 107.9 and walla....music from the car stereo system. AND, it sounds pretty good with little or no interference (of course, that depends where you are). Having the extra charger was a smart design choice. Also, the unit looks pretty good and does not take up that much room (I have an 04 Altima). Highly recommended!!"
2,Poor quality,"I bought this product about 6 months ago. It usually worked fine, although it was a bit tempermental and some days (and in some neighborhoods) it had poor reception. But after only six months it broke: the wire ripped out from the unit despite gentle handling. Overall I was disappointed with both the reception quality and the workmanship."
3,Worked REALLY good for 6 months...,"This was the best Wireless FM Car Transmitter I have ever purchased... it blocked all other incoming frequencies and broadcast to the radio perfectly for 6 perfect months and then... and then it stopped working completely. Sad! I had finally found a unit that worked (I've probably tired 5 or 6 other models) and it only lasted 6 months. Debating if I should get another one (again, when it worked it was BRILLIANT!) and hope it lasts longer, or continue my search for the perfect Wireless FM Car Transmitter.How I scored it...Function (when it functioned) = 5-starsMinus 2 stars for a short (6 month) service life.Final score = 3-stars"
3,worked,"* super easy to use* decent sound quality for everyday commuting, no static* received a sealed retail package, but somehow the plastic surface was all scratched like somebody has used it for a long time"
2,Worked great for 3 months,"No way to turn off, so had to disengage when not in use. Worked great for 3 months and then died."
2,Okay for limited use,"I've had this product for almost a year. It works decent enough for more temporary use. The sound quality is in/out. Every time I go under a set of stop lights it would buzz, lots of interference (I live in the country so it wasn't too much of an inconvenience for me but if you live in a more urban place this probably isn't the product for you). You can't listen to music if your phone/ipod/mp3 player is also charging (MAJOR interference). The cord is also very short. My charging port is down on the other side near passenger foot space instead of in the middle on the console. I had to plug my phone or ipod in and leave it on the floor most of the time which meant I also couldn't change any songs. If you're looking for a cheap product that provides so-so quality that won't get used ALL the time, this is decent enough. If you're looking for something that you will use every time you're in the car, keep looking."
4,Works as advertised!,"This works fine. The sound quality isn't as good as if you were to hook a cable up directly to your device, but if you don't have an AUX input on your receiver, then this is your best bet."
2,Complete distortion,"I bought it to listen to audio books and it is so full of noise you can barely understand the words. It is also so distorted that the narrator sounds like a completely different person. It may just be my particular one, but it is not worth trying another."
5,work really good,came quick. I have had this transmitter for quite a while now and it has worked perfectly. I would recomend this to all.
2,"i loved it when i got it , after a day it stopped working","i recieved this item LATE after i paid for 1 to 3 day shipping , and it worked for 1 day !!! it has a glass type fuze in the charger part and it burned out , we replaced it following the directions and when we plugged it in it SMOKED AND SIZZALED , we of course REMOVED it immediatly removed it , replaced the FUZE AGAIN , and it wouldn't even turn on !!!"
5,Works great!,Husband is very happy to have his iPod working in his work van as it only had a radio. Very easy to use and set up!
2,Poor electrical noise filtering,"I purchased this product hoping I could play my song downloads from my smartphone to my factory radio.While the product does the job, it has an annoying shortcoming. It allows electrical noise from my car's engine be audible through my FM radio. Since I enjoy listening to classical music, this is a big problem to me.If I am accelerating, I can hear an annoying high-pitched ""whirring"" sound through the radio. I can also hear other ""whirs"", whistling, and popping noises especially during quiet moments. The noise is not present during normal radio operation - the noise is only present when tuned into the frequency the transmitter is set to. My car has all stock components so the noise is not due to some modification or add-on.Might not be a problem with some cars since different car models have different electrical components with different degrees of electrical noise, but this product is not so great with a Jeep '06."
2,Get What you pay for,"Worked decent for a couple months, then stopped working. I'm not sure which is more cost effective, buying 10 of these over the next few years or just upgrading my deck to one with an 8mm mini input or bluetooth....oh well back to CD's for now."
1,Used it 3 times before it burned out,"The fourth time I plugged it into the cigarette lighter the light didn't come on. I kept trying, pushing it in, but no power. I plugged something else into the socket and it worked, so I plugged the transmitter in again, but still no juice. I don't think I used the thing more than 3 hours total. It worked well for those three hours, though. Piece of junk."
2,Irritating quirks,"This adapter works great if you don't have to touch it. The act of touching the cord usually creates an irritating level of static. When the unit is at rest, not being touched or jostled, it works pretty well."
5,Great Product for the Price !!!!,"I love this product. I always read the reviews before purchasing anything. The reviews were good, but I was still a little doughtful. I am glad I got it. It works great. If it gets a little static, all I have to do is change the station. As long as the radio station is picking up good, then the music sounds great. All you have to do is plug it up and play. I Love it."
2,Didn't work without static etc,"wish i could have got it working like others here but i get static. Shame, it's a great design. Tried in 2 different cars and no success."
2,Static,"This device is clever in concept with piggy back charger and compact design. However, despite what fm channel I tuned, adjusting of audio device volume input etc., there is constant static and loud popppin (at times louder than the music playing). This system does not work as well as my older unit which I got rid of just because of wear and tear issues. Emailed company a week ago with no response. I plan on returning for a refund."
3,Good but.....,"Well I have to say for the price it sounds OK. I'm a musician and the quality of the sound isn't stellar, but what it acheives for the price is great.Problem is mine has faulty wiring connections which when they are hit make a loud noise and it's annoying. But I am ordering a new one."
5,Great sound quality,This is the third transmitter I have bought and this one is by far the best one. It is easy to use and has great sound quality.
1,Disappointed,"The item sent to me was a very old one, though I orded a new one. It works, but the quality of the music was very poor and made me uncomfortable."
1,the worst one,IT ONLY WORKED FOR ONE WEEK. THE CONNECTION ARE SO POOR AND I HAVE TO PRESS IT VERY TIGHTLY IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WOKES. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT DURING YOU ARE DRIVING. I COULD NOT RETURE IT BECAUSE I LOST THE PROVE.
4,It is good,This one works good overriding the radio station's frequency. however the effect in the output is not that great. still it is a good substitute for a normal MP3 player which comes to more than $70.Good product for this price.
1,Don't buy this!,"This coby fm transmitter just does not work. I received the transmitter, tried it out in my car, and not only did it never work, it actually blew the fuse in my cigarette lighter/adapter, which was a pain to replace. I returned it to Amazon for a replacement, only to find that the replacement ALSO did not work. I finally returned both for a refund, and will find another product-- this Coby product is poorly made and just does not work (the instructions are also quite sketchy, with incorrect grammar and spelling)."
4,Better then most!,"This works better then the Belkin I had purchased a few years ago. You will not be able to listen to your music SUPER loud but it works well enough for me, I use it mostly to listen to audio books and those don't need to be blasting. My lighter in my car doesn't work anymore though, I am not sure if that is a defect of the car or the transmitter though. It was easy to find a station that works well, kept signal really well, and the bright blue back light is also a nice feature. Also you cannot beat the price!!!!"
5,Very good,I just got this today and tried it out and it work very good. The other transmitters I was looking at were very expensive and they didn't have very good reviews. This was only 17.99 and it works. The sound is clear and there was no fuzzy sound at all.
2,Never had it,"I had to cancel this order, didn't even shipped after 2 weeks of ordering. At least they were ok about it"
5,AN excellent unit that does the job,"Simply, it works really well. Good sound quality that holds up well on a 50 mile journey across numerous FM transmission areas, using the 87.5 frequency.No complaints"
2,Something to be aware of,"It does not fit 2003 Camry. I have to cut it a little bit to make it fit. I used a CD based mp3 player to feed the music to it. The problem is the CD is also powered from the cigarette lighter, put the power source at the FM transmitter generate a lot of interference. Latter I found the CD player has to be put away from the FM transmitter or it will generate extra back ground noise which is not tolerable to me. I also tried use my phone to feed music to it, because the phone is powered by battery, the interference between the FM transmitter and phone is much smaller, but it is still there. Unless the unit I bought is faulty, the unit is very sensitive to outside interference.I compared cassette adapter to the FM transmitter, cassette adapter has better treble and not sensitive to any outside interference, FM transmitter has more bass. I prefer cassette adapter because it is closer to CD quality. It is unfortunate that my cassette player only works when it is cool."
4,Well worth the price,"The Coby CA-745 works great with my MP3. I've had no interference at all, and it offers a full range of channels to choose from. Can't beat it for the price. It would be even better if it could charge the MP3 while plugged in, but I'm not complaining!"
1,Loud hum when headlights are on,"This item seems well built but has average FM transmitter sound. I could hear static and a slight hum when I first used it. When I turned on the headlights, though, a very loud hum came through the FM transmitter. Totally unacceptable sound with the headlights on."
2,Ehh...,"I liked this thing at first, even though there was always noticeable distortion, which was especially grating when I'd drive over a bump or pothole. It got pretty frustrating because the distortion became progressively worse the longer I had it, until it finally just stopped working completely, wouldn't even turn on, after only a year. Also annoying how the cord is so short. But for a while, it's decent, and you can have some good time together, just don't expect them to last."
2,So so device,"Ordered and got it in the mail as expected. Just plain so so quality when the sound is just overly distorted. I had to tune down all the low & high frequencies on the player to get less distortion...(boost up mid-range) once that is set, the next hurdle is to try and ignore road noises. The darn thing transmits volume just not that loud. Receiver volume has to be cranked up double compared to regular FM channel and still annoyingly soft. Sometimes it has static but it's okay as long as you don't move the player around that much. Not gonna recommend anyone."
1,Cheap product,"reception was ok in San Antonio, but i took it with me to LA in my short trip thr, it was not getting any reception thr...After 3 weeks stop working.. not getting any current."
2,"Muffled, mono aspect to the sound","I didn't expect the sound quality to be impeccable, but I did expect it to be decent and it is not. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 3, pretty bad. The volume fades in and out and the sound has a muffled, mono aspect to it. Not worth more than $10 in my opinion."
2,Buzz City,"This product works but the sound quality is poor with a ""buzz"" in the back ground. I believe most FM transmitters ""buzz"" and this is most likely not any worse than the rest. I barely used it before putting it in the glove box where it stays. I drive a 2005 BMW 645Ci with their premium radio."
3,Work great for 6 months,It was great for 6 months then just stopped working. Sounds was clear and easy to use. But just doesn't last long.
1,Enjoy while it lasts,"Enjoy while it lasts. Worked perfectly for 3 weeks, until it simply won't turn on. I was unable to fix."
5,Best FM Transmitter out there!,"This is my 3rd FM Transmitter, and will definitely be my last.The range is great, I haven't had to change the station once after 3 road trips over 2 hours out.Volume levels are outstanding. My old transmitters wouldn't reach half of what this one can.I also like the fact that it doesn't charge my iPod. That feature made the battery life on my iPods horrible after awhile.Anyways, this Coby transmitter is HIGHLY recommended."
5,Best FM Transmitter,I have tried many fm transmitters. This one from colby is by far the best. Not a bad price either. I get perfect sound with this one. No static at all. At least not in my vehicles.
1,Poor Quality Wire makes it useless,"I had an experience like a lot of people so I should have known better. I started with an IRiver 100 which worked great but died after 6 months. I decided to try the Colby after reading so many good reviews. I also liked the price. At first I thought that it was having trouble locking on to a station. When I finally touched the wire I found out that all of the trouble is in the connetion to the plug that plugs in to my mp3 player. The signal pops or snaps with every tiny road bump and if the wire is bumped, it will cut the signal out completely. The wire is defective and I am returning it. I may spend the big bucks and have a box hard wired between my antenna and my radio. I don't think any of these transmitters work."
1,Worked great for a couple weeks,I was really excited because this FM transmitter worked great .... for about two weeks. Now it is suddenly dead; no transmission at all. What a disappointment!
2,Good--but not reliable,"The first one that I received did not work at all. Just plain dead out of the box. No big problem, I got a replacement from Amazon and returned the non-functional one.The replacement functioned well. Good sound quality, good signal strength, easy to tune. But, after 7 months of use, the second one died as well. It'll work for 10-20 seconds and then stop working (lights go out, stops transmitting; have to unplug it, let it sit, and then plug it back in to get it to come back on for another 10-20 seconds)."
1,Arrived non-operational.,"I bought this product in January but didn't have a need for it til June, so it's now no longer under warranty, and I have a piece of junk.It looked like a promising item, with the plug-in pass-through and the up/down digital controls- it looked like exactly what I was looking for.It plugs into the lighter outlet and lights up with no problems, but it's not transmitting my audio source to the FM station I have it set to. I mean, the transmitter must be COMPLETELY dead, as there's no ""locked in"" silence you normally hear with a working FM transmitter. I have no idea if Coby will honor my warranty anymore, but I can give it a shot I guess. I brand new, never used item should not need RMA service though, no matter how long it's been sitting around my house unused.This is the first DOA product I've ever bought, and I knew it was too good to be true when I saw the Coby name. I should've known better."
1,A Letdown - Go With a Cassette Adapter!,"I've come to determine that these FM transmitters JUST DON'T WORK. I read the 5-star reviews here (which look suspiciously like they were reviewed by the product's marketing team) and thought that this product might actually work. Didn't. No matter where I was on the dial, I had to turn my volume up 3 times louder than normal to hear via this device. Guess what happens when I change the source to a real FM station? An explosion of sound in my car! Tried multiple cars (and various iterations of FM transmitters) and they've never worked well.I finally did purchase a cassette tape adapter which works great (until my next stereo which will have an alt-in for iPod!)."
3,"Not bad, not good","The good news is, it works. The bad news is, the sound quality. I've tried a variety of variations on volume and frequency and I still get some background hiss. It's not as noticable if you ride with the windows down."
1,Read Negative Reviews Before Buying,"I saw a lot of positive reviews for this, and the price was right, so I went for it. I really should have read the negative reviews first. As many of those have also claimed, my transmitter worked great--for a few days. Then suddenly it stopped working. It would turn on, but it wasn't transmitting a signal. Sometimes I could get a very fuzzy sound for a few seconds, but then it would go to complete static again. Don't buy this product. If you bought it on Amazon, don't return it to Coby as they will charge you $6 for shipping. Amazon lets you return it for free. I used the credit to get different (and better, I hope) transmitter."
3,"Great Transmission, Some feedback, Cheap Construction","First, I was really happy with the transmission power of this product. It worked great in both a car with front antenna and a car with a back antenna, though I could tell the back one was near the limit. The car with farther distance to antenna did experience some feedback and line noise that wasn't as audible when the antenna was closer. Of the many FM transmitters I've tried I think this one is probably the best so far in sound.However the construction quality was a bit low for the power connections. After about 4 months the unit no longer powered up. I took apart and it appears the solder points were a little weak for the power cables. For $18 I'm not overly surprised and I'm guessing luck will vary. Still debating on whether to buy another one or solder the old one myself."
1,yuck,I don't like it. It's all static'y when I attach it to my iPhone and play music in my car. Bummer.
5,Works Great,This is enexpensive and was shipped as expected. It works very well.It easy to set up I reccomend this product.
2,Hardly Worked,The product works but some songs you can still hear static going through. Worked for a few weeks before we had to get a new one.
2,works but sound quality is not i expected,"The overall product works fine except for there is a buzz , which may be from the interference generated from my car, but I have to turn the bass and treble all the way down to try and hide it. I do like having the power port on it so this device does just rob one of my power ports and I did not have any problems with anything not working in it."
4,Nice item,This is a good transmitter and works well. Easy to set up. However the plugs are a bit loose and sometimes the cell phone is not being charged when you think it is. You have to check to be sure the connections are tight.
3,"It does as advertised, sorta","While I am able to transmit my phone's songs to my radio, it's always squeals and is full of static, which makes listening to music painful, especially at louder volumes.It would also make more sense to me to have the control panel above the power plug, because if I plug something in, I am unable to access the control panel any more.Thank you,-David"
3,Decent... but not great.,"First--I have absolutely no experience with FM transmitters prior to this one, so what I can't do is compare/contrast, and I have no expectations of how it's ""supposed to work"".That being said, this makes music on my phone come out my car speakers. Success.Quality is not so great--even in its good moments the sound is pretty tinny, on bad days there is some static, sound quality is intermittently poor and the volume actually varies. I've tried many frequencies; I live in a small city where most frequencies are in use.All in all, I'm glad I have it so I can listen to my own tunes in the ol' Jeep without having to cart around 100 CD's that inevitably end up scratched & dirty & obliterated. Sound quality bugs me at times but other times, pretty satisfactory.Hope this helps someone in deciding."
2,broke after a couple of months,the key word is worked in this it worked good when it wrked however it didnt wrk long maybe for like 2 months then that was it the cord is just cheap thats all
3,Alright,"It works well, but it sticks out quite a lot. And my other accessories have a tough time staying inside the charging port. But the quality and sound is good."
1,junk,"Low quality item. Upon installation a buzz was heard which could only be eliminated by raising the volume of the player. after one week, it died completely. I should have known about Coby quality."
4,"Very Good Product, Great price","I attached the Coby to an IPOD and installed in a 10 year old Porsche and it's working very well. I'm in SOCAl and FM transmssions are problematic so I was skeptical it would work. Found a solid staion @ 88.5 and all is well.One point to note, check the depth of you socket - Porche's have a socket that's 0.75 inch deep and the Coby contact column is about 1.75"" - so the unit just makes the needed contacts and sticks out a bit far.All in all, a very functioning unit at a very good price"
2,Worked for a little while...,"For the first week or two that I had this, I worked perfectly. After that, it would have a slight static noise in the background almost all of the time, and on occasion it would get pretty bad. I feel like a lot of people wouldn't have had a problem with the minor static, but I'm kind of picky about that kind of thing. I sent it back (which was a very smooth process!!)"
4,grat product!,I received my fm transmitter and im happy with. Sometimes i do gets some static but its not bad at all. This is the best fm transmitter i have bought and I've bought a few. Good price.
1,Defective after a few months,"I was generally pleased with this until just recently when the outlet plug decided to loosen and stop making a strong connection with my car's cigarette lighter. Now, every few minutes after enough vibration has loosened the adapter, it goes off and you have to fight it to get it to come back on.Very irritating! Would suggest you purchase something else."
1,Stopped working after a week,Worked well for a week until it randomly decided to die mid-car-ride. Not going to bother with a replacement item and I will try something else.
4,Just as I expected.,"When my transmitter arrived, immediately I went to the car to try it out. Sitting in the driveway it was GREAT! pretty clear, with just a hint of backgound noise - nothing a bit of volume wouldn't cover up. When I drove around the hissing got worse, fairly weak signal. Caveat to this is I have a wagon and the radio antenna is laminated into the rear side windows about 7' from transmitter. I got an extension power chord and mounted it on the visor and it is much better! I wish my antenna was mounted up front to save the additional expence and clumsyness of the extra chord.Summation: Good value, money well spent. Check location of antenna first- works best within 3'"
1,not worth the money,"The item burned out the fuse very quickly , it feels cheap . and its very large so it tales up room . not at all happy with the design or product!"
2,cheap wires,The device arrived with a large scratch on it but worked well enough to keep. The cable has to be bent a certain way or else it sounds flat instead of stereo. I have gotten tired of messing with it. I will look for another FM transmitter (with a detachable cable to hedge my bets).Other than that it was a plus that you can pick pretty much any frequency (the lowest frequency worked best for me) and it's a plus that you can plug other cigarette plugs into this one.
2,not worth the money,"This provided very marginal service for a few months before dying. The worst part was the plug never had a stable connection with the outlet. I had to frequently wiggle it back and forth to get contact. Then if you drove over a bump you would lose the connection. That was very frustrating and maddening. Second, it was hard to change the channel because there is little tactile feedback, it is hard to see the readout, and also because pushing buttons would invariable cause the plug to lose contact without me knowing it. As a transmitter, you could always hear a hum in the background of whatever you were listening to so I would have to turn up the volume of my device and turn down the volume of the car radio. Overall this provided marginal usability, but was frustrating to operate."
1,Doesn't work,"The adapter did not work in the plug: it never turned on. The phone charger I plugged into it, also never worked. Returning this immediately."
3,Would have rated it higher if it lasted a bit longer...,"I would have rated this higher if 1) the reception was better; even on the strongest station the reception was fuzzy. It was like the interference a radio antenna might get if it's too close to another piece of metal.2) One of the contacts snapped in half after owning it about a year. I didn't use it very often, so it didn't break from over use. It's just not that sturdy. I'll buy another, but it'll be a different brand/model."
3,"You get what you pay for, or maybe a little more in this case.","I like that the tuner is digital and you can span the whole spectrum which is not always possible for something this cheap. And this is very necessary with this transmitter because if you are even close to another station the quality drops off very quickly and it sounds like you are listening to your music through a pile of blankets. If you raise your mp3 volume too high it cracks and distorts as well. Even when you have a good station and the sound of your mp3 and stereo finely tuned it still sounds pretty bad compared to a decent stereo or headphones. But, it IS functional so far, and at about a 1/3 of the price of other transmitters it is probably only about 2/3 of their quality or better. So that probably makes it a good deal."
1,Poor audio quality & very low volume,"This device did not work well with either my Droid Smartphone or my iPod Nano. The signal was very weak playing to the FM radios in both of our cars. There was lots of background noise. I tried as many blank frequencies as I could find throughout the FM dial. The sound quality was so bad that I'm going to return this item. It is totally unusable. This may be due to the distance from the device to the FM antennas in my cars, but it should be strong enough to reach to the rear window or rear mounted antenna. For me it didn't live up to the reviews I read on Amazon before I ordered."
1,Doesn't work... bad warranty,"Out of the box, my FM transmitter didn't work. An intermittent connection inside the 1/8"" stereo plug caused terrible noise every time the cable was touched or the car hit a bump. I tried connecting other MP3 players and confirmed it was a problem with the Coby. After two days, the unit stopped powering up at all. The fuse is intact, so there's something wrong with the device.The warranty requires me to file a claim, pay for two-way shipping ($12) and wait 4-6 weeks for repair or replacement. However, for less time and money, I can run to Walmart and buy a competitors product today. Worthless warranty."
3,Great with a huge caveate,"Great item for the money, and well designed over all. That being said, the static and awful feedback creates a constant high pitched whine that worsens if the phone is being charged simultaneously. I won't by from Coby again."
2,decent,"I guess I just expected more after reading the reviews. I liked the tilting action of the screen, helpedwith sun reflection. Easy to use plug n go type action, but the sound quality was very very disappointing. The whole reason behind getting it was so I could listen tomusic. Quality was so bad I only use it when I have no radio signal."
2,"Bad Audio Cable causes ""blowing on the Mike"" feedback","I ordered 2 based on the mostly positive Amazon user reviews, but am returning them because every bump or move of my MP3 player which causes the Coby Audio Input cable to move causes a loud and distinctive sort of bumping or blowing into a microphone noise. Probably a poor design aspect."
1,Did not work - no support from vendor,"I thought I got a brand new product, but there were already some scratches on it when I took it out of the packaging. I plugged it into my car charger and it didn't do anything. I replaced the fuse and still nothing. I tried contacting the supplier and they have yet to get back to me... Now, it's past the return period, so I'm stuck with a worthless piece of junk!"
1,Coby has some issues,"I purchased this unit, it worked fine for about 30 seconds then it blew the fuse in my car. After several tries, and fuses, retunred it to Amazon for a new unit. Got the replacement, hooked it up, lo-and-behold it worked and sounded quite good; however, when I started the car up later the unit was dead, or I should say the cigar lighter circiut was... it blew the fuse AGAIN. After a couple of more tries and fuses, I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon."
5,Great Product,I am very happy with the product. It is a good quality build and works as explained. Quality of the sound to the radio is good too. Recommend it for anyone who needs the cig lighter port for an additional device and needs a headphone jack based FM transmitter.
5,Best Solution,"I don't normally write reviews unless I am polarized one way or another but I feel compeled to comment on the Coby CA-745.I was hesitant to buy this product due to Coby not having a stellar reputation but this thing really works well with my Zune.Keep in mind that it may have static for the first few minutes. I remember reading a review where someone stated that it was static electricity. When I first plugged it in I thought ""crud, it doesn't sound good at all"" but, once I unplugged it and plugged it back in it sounds great. Fits perfectly in my Mercedes and Honda van.Not sure why so many people with Toyotas are having issues with fit. Also, I have read a lot of reviews where it sounds like peoples stereos are at fault or at least the user is at fault. Sounds like a id 10 t problem.It always bugged me that I couldn't enjoy my mp3 music in my car. Now I can jam out to The Sword and Lamb of God anytime I want."
5,Great Car Transmitter! Excellent Value!,"This transmitter works great. The sound is clear. I made sure to pick a frequency that didn't have a station within 0.2 Hz of it. I haven't had any interference. It is super easy to use and the extra plug is an added bonus. I looked at the more expensive brands, and they didn't seem to offer anything the Colby didn't have. I have absolutely no complaints, and the price is awesome! The ability to rotate it is also a great extra feature. I can make it fit into almost any tight space with a charging port. It definitely won't fall out of the port either. I can't think of any negatives for this product. I love it!"
2,OK For Awhile,"This is a very ""no-frills"" type of transmitter, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's easy to use, and you can still use your cigarette liter (say to charge a phone or something) while you're listening to your MP3 player over the radio. It's easy to use, and I didn't have any trouble receiving the signal loud and clear over my stereo. However, it developed a short in the wire that connects to your MP3 player after about 7 months. The cord is hard wired into the device, and cannot be replaced. The short got very bad, very quickly and the whole thing was all but unusable after 8 months. I leave my FM transmitters in my car, so perhaps the fluctuations in temperature played a role. In my opinion, this is not a good buy. There is an FM transmitter made by Soundfly on Amazon that I've had much better luck with."
4,It's ok,It's a good transmitter but just a little noisy. It does get the signal through but when volume is over 50% you will hear the hissing noise. Other than that it's OK and worth buying.
2,Not so good,"After an exhaustive search for a good FM transmitter, I thought this product was a good choice: it seemed to have a good quality and a reasonable price, but it doesn't work so well after all.The pros:-No batteries needed, just plug it in the cigarette lighter. Also you still have the plug available because of the built-in outlet-Easy-to-read, blue-color backlit screen-Long pigtail cable. To give an idea of how long it is, a person sitting on the rear seat can use the player while connected to the transmitter on the front-You can choose almost any station you want-It can be retracted to take less space when stored-The materials are fine - FM transmitters are not the sturdiest devices anyway, but this one seems fineThe cons:-The worst one: lots of interference and noises. It's hard to find a station where the audio listens properly.Bottom line: Choose a better one if possible. This one is not the worst, but as I said, it's not so good."
4,Works Great!,I love that you can plug this into the headset area on your ipod or phone. It works wonderful! I do not have issues with noises or anything like my old itrip fm transmitter.
1,Unusable in my 2005 GMC Yukon,Sound quality was abysmal. Just static. I would not recommend buying this product at all. Should have returned it. Glad it was cheap.
4,Works great,The transmitter works great . Good price for what it is. I use everyday in my work truck. Very happy with it.
4,Good for the Price,"Arrived in good time with super saving shipping. Product is cheap and light, but it does the trick with no problems so far. It's very simple, with just buttons to change the frequency, but it gets the job done and has held up just fine under moderate usage."
3,"Initially Faulty, Traded, Never Replaced","I ordered this device, it arrived in a very short period of time.I plugged it into my car, programmed the radio to receive the signal. Worked fantastic for being in the center of a city.Then I plugged in my phone. The audio receiver pin did not transmit anything but what came out of my front left speaker. SAD DAY!So I returned it for a replacement. Hopefully this next one will be better than the first. Considering there was only 1 significant issue, it still gets 3 stars.UPDATE 1.5 Months Later:I returned the item and the return order was never refilled. Very disappointed. This has never happened to me until now.3 stars are still given because I think most of this had to do with coincidental circumstances."
5,Nice unit,"This is the first FM transmitter I have owned. I've had it for a few weeks. It works well, sounds fine. I use it to listed to lectures."
2,Not for long term use.,I really wanted this to work so I could listen to my Ipod while driving. The price was certainly right. It did work great for about 2 months. After that it would gradually work loose and lose conection. You could reseat the adapter and it would work for a while before you would have to reseat it again. After about 4 months the only way it would work is if you held it place. Not very practical while driving.
1,Lead Exposure Warning,"The packaging for this device states ""Handling the cords of this product will expose you to lead"" and you should wash your hands after handling the them. Would have been nice to know this before purchasing. It's Made in China, you got to love it. You also won't see this warning unless you use a magnifying glass."
5,Works great,"It well in the city I live in. The biggest problem I've had with FM transmitters in the past is when I travel because I've had to switch the frequency periodically as I drive to find a new station that works. With this one I drove 1,500 miles and didn't have to switch once. My only complaint is that sometimes there's a ton of static if the cord is bent in the wrong way. As soon as I find a position for the cord that works, I don't have any problems. But I would buy it again."
4,"Performs well, no issues thus far","This transmitter works as advertised. Plugs into the car outlet, easy to set up, performs well. The additional outlet also works well. I have no complaints."
1,This is a piece of junk,There is a high pitched whine when the car engine is running. There is a low pitch whine when the engine is off. Basically there is always a background noise that drives me crazy. I don't have the best hearing so it has to bother others.I have been using a different wireless TX with my MPS player for the last 5 years. It broke and I was not able to find a newer version of the old one. I thought I would try this one but it does not work nearly as well as my old one. I have ordered a different wireless transmitter and will throw this one in the garbage when I get it.
5,The one that works.,"It doesn't charge, but allows for a charger to also be plugged in. No static like most FM transmitters. I use the lowest frequency. Simple and easy to use. I've purchased two of these."
4,Coby CA 745,Used it on a long car trip (8 hrs) and only had to change the FM frequency once. Overall good sound quality and relatively easy to use.
3,Not as great as I thought,"So when I bought this a couple months ago I was very pleased with the sound quality and what not. Since then, after only two or three months of use, it has already broken; the wire started coming out and it was ruined. I didn't treat it badly at all, so apparently it is pretty cheaply made. Also, the charger part didn't fit very well in my car, it was too big, so only went about a third of the way in and came loose sometimes. I thought it was good and trusted all the reviews, but now I am starting my search over, and hoping for better luck this time around!"
4,Exactly what I needed!,Really like this transmitter. Works great for what I need. The fact the you can plug in another device at the same time was key - It doesn't charge my iphone so I just plugged in the charger at the same time so it worked wonderfully. It is a bit bulky so I couldn't have a drink in my cup holder since the transmitter took up too much room but it wasn't a big deal. I also couldn't read the display very easily in the day - but once I found a channel it didn't really matter. Great product - good price - overall happy.
2,Didn't last.,"It was never fantastic, but it did the job. Unfortunately, after owning it for a few months, I ran into the same problem at least one other reviewer did: Every little bump in the road would jostle the connection, and even the slightest bit of that caused obnoxious loud crackling. This made it completely unusable in very short order."
4,works!,Works good so far.. set up on a xm-radio. I have burt up a few of these type of modulators and am happy at this time. price is right
3,"good for the price,but thats it","best FM transmitter for the price, there is a slight buzzing sound in the background at all times though it can get really annoying"
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I bought the cheapest mp3 player to radio converter for my car that I could find, and it wound up being the best one I've ever had. My girlfriend is buying the same one for her car because hers (which cost twice as much) doesn't cut the mustard."
2,Great ... until it died,"This has good transmission power for a low price. It did well on open bands and I had very few issues with the device in the first 3 months of ownership. Then, right outside of 90 days, it died. No warning, nothing. I treated this unit well and there is nothing in the way that I treated it that would have contributed to its early demise. Buyer beware."
1,Didn't Work,I plugged it in to my cigarette lighter in my car and it didn't work. My Mazda has two different power outlets and I tried them both - it never turned on. I went to the store and spent $50 on a Belkin that charges my Ipod while it plays it through the radio and it works perfectly.
5,good item,"This is a very good item,works great.Iuse it to play my Garmin 350 Nuvimusic and other audio it plays.The extra plug in port is also very handy.Extra good buy for the money."
2,Not strong enough for a Pathfinder in LA,"I've tried mulitple FM transmitters both because I live in LA and there's not a lot of free airspace on the radio band and because I need a good signal for my vehicle. Unfortunately this was one of the worst. I was so excited that it had the adapter-within-an-adapter so you can plug both the transmitter and something else into the port. However, this unit did not have enough power to transmit my mp3 player music clearly. The sound was very static-y on multiple stations, even with the volume on the MP3 turned way up. I have a suspicion this has to do with the fact the Pathfinder's antena is in the back windows. Just for kicks, I plugged it into the port in the trunk area. The sound was better, but then you can't control the device. Had to return and still looking for a solution."
2,Poor sound quality,"Technically, this product works. The problem is that the sound quality is slightly better than an AM radio. I was very disappointed."
2,Stopped working after less than 2 weeks,"The product was great at first, worked fine, no static, no need to change the channel while driving. However, it quit working...it won't turn on anymore when I plug it into the car so I am going to have to send it back. Also, how can it be called wireless? I have to plug a cord into the car and then the MP3 player..."
1,Coby CA745,Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter with Digital Display and DC Car Cigarette Lighter AdapterProduct is a piece of junk! Did not last a week!
1,Broke after 1 week,"I took a chance on this mp3 despite the mixed reviews, it started out great, for about a week. After that it wouldn't stay on while plugged into cigarette lighter, it would go in and out, when I would get it in the perfect position if i hit a bump in the road it would shut off again so annoying. I tried it in different vehicles and it wouldn't work, I returned this right away and got a full refund since I only had it for 1 week. Take a chance maybe you'll get a good one wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money."
5,Couldn't ask for more.,"I got the Coby CA-745 FM Transmitter about a week ago and couldn't be happier. My last FM transmitter wouldn't sit firmly in the cigarette lighter anymore causing frequent power loss, so it was time for a new one. I've been more than satisfied with this product.I have had zero interference so far and I drive about 60 miles every day. The springs on the adapter are very strong and hold the unit firmly in the cigarette lighter. I use this for my Ipod and phone with Pandora.Bottom line: Crisp, clear sound, strong signal. Highly recommended."
4,Works perfect but,"So i purchased this and it took a MONTH to receive.. boo! But it works great and I absolutely love it! The only thing is I use it for my phone. So, when plugging my phone on the charger and this device it makes a weird sound. If you dont mind the annoying little buzzing sound its great. Ive just learned to either charge my phone and listen to the radio or just let the thing die.. lol! but i do love it!"
1,TOO MUCH STATIC,"Had a Belkin that needed replacing. Went with this one based on the reviews. The Colby was terrible, all static."
4,Works Well,"I will admit that this looks a little cheesy, but it does work well. I'm also guessing here, but if it were better made, it would cost a whole lot more..... The only reason I did not give it a full five stars is; I know if it is at all mishandled, its a goner."
5,"Easy to Use, Works Great","I did a lot of research on wireless transmitters before finally deciding on this one. I had it in my Amazon cart for a while, then my satelite radio went out, and then this became a necessity. Works right out of the box, I just plugged it in an set to 87.9. No static or any other problems. (Only if you put the mp3 player too close to the adapter) The extra adapter is a life saver. I've used it to charge my phone or run my GPS system. I also have a separate DC split adapter and can use three products at once (kids dvd player, GPS, and charge my phone). I have a Sansa clip (1G), and it works just fine. I do have to turn the volume up high on the Sansa clip. The the quality of the music at times, is even better than the satelite radio. I've had it for 5 months, with no problems."
1,Disappointing,"My first Coby worked ok for about a week, then stopped working. It would work for 10-30 minutes, then stop transmitting. I returned it and exchanged it for another one, which was dead on arrival. I plan on trying the Aerielle i2i next."
2,"It works, but the FM signal is too weak.","The device works as described. However, there is a major drawback: the received FM signal is very weak, and I have to turn up the volume of my car radio very high. When I drive on highway, I have to turn up the volume to the full scale. Doing so causes a lot of problems: including high circuit noise and I will hear huge interfere sounds when I touch the buttons of the device.The radio antenna of my car is in the front. The situation may be improved if the antenna is in the back of the car. I believe that if there are no metal frame/sheets in the path between the device and antenna the received FM signal will be much stronger.Also, I suspect that other FM car transmitters of this kind would have the same issue in my car: weak received FM signal."
1,Did Not Work,"The CA-745 worked for about 30 seconds & then refused to turn on again. I purchased it because of the price. It also looked cheap - the face was scratched & peeling. I returned it and purchased the Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter for Sansa, which I am very happy with. Also note - The CA-745 has a large unit/plug sticking out from the power outlet in the dashboard, (others like the iTrip are separated by a wire)I could not plug it in or easily access it when my car was in park because the shifter is right in front of the plug in my dashboard (Nissan Pathfinder)"
3,Good Transmitter but short life,"I have owned this for over a year so I speak from having used it extensively.The Good:* Great Device. Good sound transfer. Great Range of Frequencies especially the ones below 88.1 are very useful as no one uses those channels to broadcast. This is one of the rare devices which goes below 88.1The Bad:* A little flimsy in construction. Mine seems to loose electrical connection every few seconds and the sound is awful.It was great while it lasted.After thoughts: Better quality, rigid and simple construction could really make this a winning device until then only 3 stars from me."
3,Coby CA-745 transmitter,Trasnmitter does work fairly well. Some cracking and popping reception can depend on vehicle you are in and the station you are on. Works best on empty channels.
4,Working great so far....,"My Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter with digital display and cigarette lighter adapter works very well. I use it almost daily in the Baltimore/DC area with either my XM inno radio or iPod and it sounds great. Using XM's frequency finder online, I found the best frequency to use between the 2 cities (a crowded FM band). The audio is not distorted, and the signal is strong. Much better than the iTrip I had before, and cheaper than the Inno radio car adapter system!"
1,looks cool but mine was junk,"ok.pros. the thing is really cool. allows you to plug something into it so you can use the socket still, lets you change the channel so you can listen on any station you want unlike ones with only pre-selected channels, even has a back light so you can see the screen and buttons.cons. the thing broke on me not even two weeks into using it. just driving home when the thing won't work anymore. the screen still lights up but it doesn't transmit. so now i have a worthless cigarette lighter extender.product would have been 5 stars if it worked. i had a monster one that lasted me a year before it died. this coby just was just pathetic."
1,Don't waste your money,"Received the Coby CA-745 transmitter for Christmas, but didn't open the package until July 2009. Product did not work when I first tried to use it, but after 10 minutes started to work. Successfully used it for 2 days, and then it quit working again. This unit has issues, and would not purchase again. Had I tested it right after receiving it, I could have returned it."
1,Not worth it,"The transmitter worked really well for about a month, then stopped working completely. It wasn't even worth returning since it would have cost more to send the product back than it originally cost."
5,Awesome,"Have yet to have any problems 5 months in. Signal is clear, transmits about 15 feet cleanly, starts to get staticy at 20, signal can still be heard at 35+ feet. I use this on 87.7 like another reviewer suggested and the signal is great, plus the fact that it doesn't actually use up your lighter, awesome. I plug this in with the phone charger plugged inside, and pull them all out together and store them in the center console."
3,Fuzzy noise constantly,Other than that it does the job. My old transmitter was much clearer and I could program statiosn. Good for the $.
5,Great gift,"I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend whose old transmitter cut out. He said this one works great and has very clear quality. I've heard it myself, and it seems to be great. Great for the price paid. Some out there are 2x-3x more."
3,Works ok... Not great...,Seemed like I was still getting quite a bit of static. Also made the sound quality not so good either. Would suggest a USB or a aux jack to connect your music devices to car stereo.
2,Two went bad in less than 16 months....,"I've gone through two of these in 16 months. The first one lasted a year before the cords came out. For $17, I was good with that. However, the second one didn't even last 4 months. It stopped in mid-play and that was it. I can find no reason why it stopped. Unfortunately, it only has a 30-day warranty so I think it's time to spend a bit more money and get something that has a longer warranty, and hopefully better quality."
1,Broke after 1 day!,"No exaggeration -- this worked for a couple hours then...dead. And when it worked, it wasn't great because I live in an area where there isn't much FM bandwidth that isn't taken up by a radio station, so there was a constant buzz from interference.Too bad -- I really would've liked this to work well."
1,worked for only 5 minutes,"died after 5 minutes. no lights or power, no sign of what went wrong. waste of money. very frustrating purchase."
5,Great Product,"Great Price, Works well and much cheaper than ones in store. The cord is a little fragile, but if you take care of it, no problems."
2,Cheap pan,"Replaced this with an All Clad 12 inch fry pan. This pan is functional, but the handle is cheap rolled steal and the entire thing feels flimsy."
4,Product is great - poor packaging - one broke in transit,"They're fantastic - the 11 that I have (since one broke in transit). Quite the hit on Thanksgiving table. IF amazon had treated me more fairly, I would have given this a 5 because the product is great. amazon agreed to a refund - which was nice of them - BUT the price went up 36% when I reordered to have a full set of 12 and they wouldn't make a price adjustment."
1,gift,"These were bought as a gift for someone but haven't given them to her yet. They are tiny and cute, so I am hoping she will love them."
5,A wonderful tool to be afirmed.,I want to congratulate Mr. James Riddle for his wonderful books. The books helps to affirmed us in what we are in Christ. God bless you Mr. Riddle and thank you for sharing your learnings from your intimate moments with the Holy Spirit of Christ our Lord and Saviour. Actually The Holy Spirit guided me to get to these books. Praise His Name!!!Jeaneth Rodriguez
4,Girl on the cover,"The blonde girl on the album cover is Deloris Erickson. She was also on Cy Colemans ""witchcraft"" album and she was most famous as a brunette on Herb Alperts album ""Whipped Cream and Other Delights"" She was a ford model and now she's retired to Kelso Washington near Seattle."
4,"Cute Casual Clutch, Good Quality","Cute clutch. Slightly bigger than I would like, but it fits all my essentials nicely. It even fits my 7.25 x 4.5 inch wallet. The material is kind of canvas-like which makes it more casual than I thought it would be. It's more like a day clutch. The quality is good, not great. The cuts in the piping is a little sloppy-looking. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's just not exactly what I was expecting."
4,An important reference book,"Having been raised in the South, I've started researching how our foodways have been effected by the African culture. Surprisingly, the subject is not documented very well. However, Paige's book is an excellent place to start! He has included lots of footnotes and a lengthy bibliography.I've only given it 4 stars because I found several typographical errors. Don't let that stop you from reading this book! I found it interesting and fun! It even includes recipes! Yum!"
3,Old School,"I bought this software after reading good reviews about it. If I had consulted my husband first (our computer expert) he would have informed me that, even though our computers are old (2001), they are not old enough to run these (I also made the mistake of buying Inventor Labs - Transportation) programs. Serves me right for being impatient."
4,Extrodanarily Exquisite,This book will blow your mind with the beautiful paintings from all different time periods. Don't miss out on how Hartely brings together all his passions into this one exquisite book.
5,Lenox Platinum Cpllection Bath Towel,"I ordered this towel in Diamond Blue as a gift. This towel is beautiful. The color is fantastic, and the towel is so soft. I wish I had one for myself..I'll probably get one at a later date. Just love it!"
5,The BEST towels,"These towels are pricey, BUT they are the softest, most absorbent towels I have found. Not too thick, not too thin. They wash up well. I want to replace all my towels with these!"
4,could dry two people or,"probably 5. It's soft and heavy and works better after the second wash. I'll buy more. Only four stars, I don't think $25 is to much but getting close to it."
2,Lenox towels,"These towels are not worth the money, they are really linty, i washed them twice and the lint is still coming off."
1,Ugly green towel,Based on the reviews and the picture color for Chartreuse Green that's what I ordered. What I received was a dull medium green towel - so ugly a green that i don't know what to compare it to. It wasn't that thick and I have less expensive towels that are a lot softer. This must be either a knock off or 2nd because it's just plain ugly - and I normally love all shades of green. Would have sent it back just too much trouble. Beware that colors in the pictures may be WAY off.
2,towels,"MY WIFE AND I THOUGHT WE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT BATH TOWEL-SOFT,ABSORBENT-COLOR THAT MATCHES OUR BATHROOM-BUT AFTER JUST TWO LAUNDERINGS THE BATH TOWELS STARTED TO FADE UNUSUALLY AND ARE EVEN SPLOTCHY. THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE TOWELS BUT THEY LOOK AWFUL. WE HAD ALSO PURCHASED MATCHING HAND AND WASH CLOTHS AT THE SAME TIME. THEY HAVE NOT HAD ANY FADING IN SPITE OF FREQUENT WASHINGS. HOPE YOU FIND THIS INFORMATION USEFUL."
3,Heavy towel,"I recommend this towel to anyone that can lift it.The towel is very absorbent and the quality is good, although I had to clip off a long thread.The problem for me is that it is a very heavy towel, coupled with its size, makes it difficult for an older person to easily use. I can see how a younger person would be perfectly happy with this towel."
1,Towel got harder not softer,"Maybe I got a bad set or something, but the bath towel, and hand towel after just a few months has gotten harder not softer like the other reviewers say. It's still very absorbent, and I can tell it is durable but definitely not soft. I've found a less expensive and much better bamboo towel by another manufacturer"
1,sandalwood bath towels faded,"I did not purchase these from Amazon but from a major dept store. I bought 2 complete sets of Sandalwood colored towels, I washed them together - the bath towels completely faded while the the hand and face clothes retained their original color. Poor quality control for such expensive towels."
4,Great towel for good price,"The towels were a good compromise between soft and absorbent. Great size, not a body towel, but ample. I've washed twice and they come out looking like new. It does take a long time to dry - the price you pay for luxury."
5,Best towels ever,"These are the best towels I have ever used. They are thick, soft and thirsty. I had no problems with a lot of lint from the towels when I first used them as some had reported. I am so amazed at how quickly and easily they wick the water off and they feel so luxurious. I never wanted to have to pay over $8 for a towel, but these are well worth the extra money. I bought a second set for myself and now I am buying a set of the towels for my daughter."
4,More than adequate.,"It's not like drying yourself off with an angora chamois (but then, it doesn't cost what such a ridiculous product might cost), but it's certainly both soft enough, and absorbent enough to be considered a bath towel of high quality."
4,Old fashioned good advice,This is an older text that still yields good advice. It's the kind of book to give yourself a refresher on learning and growing.
5,Perhaps not for everybody - but a great book nonetheless!,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. However, I think that to someone who is not a fairly regular practitioner of zen meditation it may seem very strange. For those who DO practice zazen on a regular basis, this book has a lot to offer. It's a very pleasant, quasi-poetic extended meditation on many topics. Don't want to try to pigeonhole it much beyond that. I thought it was a great read and I'm grateful to the author for writing it."
2,Didn't love this,"It may have been the author's intention or just his style, but I didn't find the flow of the book to be as engaging. Sometimes a bit preachy"
4,An Hour of Silence,"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. If you saw the movie, Mongul, there is a lesson to observe about how the Mongolian fighters used any means to destroy their enemies. There are entities on Earth now posing as humans, all have the same shape with nothing underneath, no human feelings, or guilt, for the turmoil they cause.Silence is a power unto itself. Sometimes, silence can be soothing and healing. At other times, it can be dull and nerve-wracking. I attented a speech class a few years ago and observed the class members racing through their well researched speeches. The teacher asked if I had anything to say to them, having been through this process myself as a college student. I commented that they all had worked hard and done well on developing their speeches. Yet, they must know that at times silence speaks louder than words. When it is prevalent in a child with autism, it's rather distressing. Eric is the exception."
4,Beautiful!,"This bowl is beautiful! It is the rich green one expects in high quality crystal, and the cuts are fairly sharp. One thing, however--the bowl is not a heavy weight crystal--the glass is thinner than my more expensive pieces, and therefore lighter in weight. There are a few small bubbles in the glass, but then you find the same thing in Waterford crystal these days. I would recommend this bowl, as it is sizable, beautiful in color, and has an appealing, classic cut."
5,perfume,"My mother and I and also my sister love this fragrange and have been using it for 30 years. Our local Irish Import store went out of business so I was so pleased and lucky to find it ""where else but Amazon"". Thanks again for having such a wide range of products and I will continue to be a faithful shopper!"
1,To strong for me,"I had to give this perfume away, it's a little to strong for me, smells like old women perfume, back in 1970..To strong!tamara"
1,Great start but loses steam quickly.,"The book started our great. But after 4 chapters, I was bothered by the prevelant prejudice slurs - racial, social, physical. Even the ""hero"" makes these comments about a black baby, overweight man, pregant woman, and people who ""wear white shoes after Labor Day"". These comments combined with the lack of character development and predictable events made the book nearly impossible to finish.Granted the end was a mild surprise but after they tested everybody's DNA for the countless time and the court battle was 50 pages too long, I just didn't care anymore."
3,For me... educational,"A page turner and easy read with a satisfying ending. I enjoyed learning about the history, landscape and mindset of the South's upper crust society.I liked the strength of Page who bridged the gap between upper class White society and African American discrimination. I appreciated her gradual realization that, while she 'did not' discriminate, she had a white mentality that affected her view of black people. It was good to see her experience racial discrimination first hand.Overall though, I felt that characters weren't always very well developed (I mean, what did Page ever see in that Governor puke), dialog was unnatural and weak, and while the ending was satisfying, it wrapped up into the nice little package that I predicted halfway through the book but with one surprise."
3,Good funky acid tinged jazz.,"I really don't have that much to add beyond what others have said. JTQ has a neat organ driven sound which reminds me of the 70's quite strongly. Some of the songs are pretty good, some are just 'there', and they're not going to set the world on fire with any deep lyrical thought here. Basically, this is fun, grooving music which I use often as background music when working on photoshop projets or just need a mood lift. This isn't esoteric, intellectual, or deep, just good old funky fun. Probably not as good as Incognito, but maybe more listenable at times. Worth checking out if this is your bag, but not worth going to the ends of the earth to find. Recording quality is a bit compressed and processed, and thus could be better, but still slightly above average."
4,If you Love Great Jazz....,"There are not many productions that will grab you and hold on as this one will. Every selection is filled with energy. I enjoyed every track. That in it self says a great deal about this selection. Although it's in limited production and difficult to aquire. It can be purchased here. If you Love good, no great jazz check it out. There is no dissapointment in this recording"
1,BAD BUSINESS,"I MET THIS BROTHER THAT REPRESENT THEM AND IT WILL BE NICE IF THE CD'S DIDNT MALFUNCTION I CALL NUMEROUS TIMES NOW HIS PHONE IS DISCONNECT,ITS ASHAME WHEN YOUR OWN PEOPLE DISS YOU LIKE THIS BRO.MUHAMMED OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB AND YOU KNOW WHOM I AM,,WILD 100 CHICAGO ACTION , I SHOULD HAD DOWNLOAD IT STRAIGHT IN THE GARBAGE"
4,Ventshade for camry,They are easy to install and the two sided tape really takes hold. Never a problem with any of this brand ventshades coming off or leaking water through. I just wish they made clear plastic models. Your pillar blind spot gets a lot bigger.
2,Faded print on t shirt,I was very dissapointed when I washed (according to instructions on on the label)the shirt and most of the paint on the lettering washed off. I would never order again. The shirt was a good quality---it was the painted on stenciling that was poor.
4,Tree Pruner,Works great. I did have to drill the adapter to get the bolt through but no big deal. I would buy this unit again compared to the prices at the box stores.
4,Works as advertised But could be better,"This is the first time I used a pruner. I was able to use the tool effectively to trim dead branches off a large oak tree after just a few tries. It was relatively easy. Miner problems are:1. the pruner holes are not in the same position as the pole saw. I had to drill another set of holes to the black connector.2. To switch between pole saw and pruner you will have to remove the nut and bolt, not so conveniences."
1,defective out of the box,"first one i received was defective... the metal blade was hitting the red hook and was impossible to prune with... it appear as if the red metal hook was bent, thus causing the problem... Ordered a replacement and I'll comment further when I get the new item... seems beefy and well made, we'll see!!!!"
5,great basic tool,These pliers come in handy and I am thrilled to have them available for myself whenever needed now. A great basic tool to have in your tool chest.
1,Looks good on paper,My experience mirrors that of the previous reviewer. The jaw tips bend with moderate pressure.
1,Truly the most awful Yo-Yo Ma ever!!,"Exceedingly hard as it is to put ""Yo-Yo Ma"" and ""truly awful"" in the same sentence, this album does it with ease. If you are looking for relaxing, smooth, easy music this one is NOT for you. If you are in the mood for militant vocals (yes, vocals) and harsh rhythms with just a sliver of the elegant Yo-Yo Ma we all know and love, then this one is definitely for you."
5,Essential reading in Texas history,"Another customer review used the word 'laconic,' and it is apt. The author could have said more than he did, but he was writing for readers of an earlier time, who must have known more about the frontier than most of us do today."
1,Super,"Gillett has lived a wonderful life. I have read many Texas Rangers books and this one is very good. You have to understand the absolute bravery of the Texas Ranger and the lack of any fear. Never in the book does any weakness raise it's head and at the same time never does Gillett take on the attitude of, ""I shot a bear"". I have fowarded the book to my son in Chicago. I don't think he shares my admiration for the Ranger force, but someday he will."
4,Exciting and informative,Autobiography of a man who lived in the old west. This tells the tale of a by-gone era and should be welcomed by anyone with a taste for history of that time.
5,"It's A Can Opener - and, it works every time!","The Title says it all... this is a quality manual can opener, easy to use, even for these 65 year old hands. Why mess with an electric can opener when these work great, every time. Nice product, and well-built."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book. Michael Dell is wonderful. This is a ""must read"" book."
1,"Buy the stock, not the book","I know everyone who is a Dell computer fan was anxiously waiting this release, but do yourself a favor and invest in the stock, not the book. A rather borish attempt at giving us new insights into corporate strategy. There is nothing here that you can not get from a freshman business course. The book is written in two parts. The first part gives you an insight into Dell as an early entrepreneur. He should have stopped there. The second part, is an over simplification of business strategy; listen to your customers, strategic partnering is key, and information rules. Michael Dell is obviously a great CEO and deserves much acclaim for the success of his company, but the book not up to par. We have all heard this before. Yaaaawn!"
3,Easy read,"I read this book back in the 1990s. It is a good, easy-to-read book about Michael Dells rise from nothingness to becoming the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. It's an interesting and entertaining story, but didn't add much value to my life overall. So I'd recommend it for it's entertainment value alone (it's pretty shallow)."
4,I expected much more..,"Dell has been one of the most admired companies in the recent years especially when one speaks of effeciency in the supply chain. I was looking for strategies and operational details on how really Dell suceeded in making this happen. While the book clearly brings outh the core beliefs at Dell, the details I was looking for are missing. Mr Dell, I am sure that you will read this review- Please come out with "" Direct from Dell -2 -A closer look at our Operations"" . I am glad that the proceeds from this book are going to charity."
4,Mind behind the plan.,"Michael is perhaps the LUCKIEST Texan alive. LUCK is where Opportunity meets Preparation. He had all three! and knows how to execute! Good Book. I wouldn't quit your day job ... He won't!Now the challenge is to do it again.Most of all what this book does, is underscore the non-requirements for all of the dreams a person can imagine, while at the same time, shatters the requirement that a Diploma is a requirement to begin. This falsely restricts creativity.He is by far, in the realm of notoriety with: Abraham Lincoln -Famous Lawyer- NO Law School Thomas Edison; Mark Twain; Charles Dickens never finished Grade school.This is a good ""101 guideline"" to how a man created a Status; Not the Status a man."
5,A must read for anyone in business,"Mike Dell has written an easy to read but complex book. If you are in business or want to be, get this book. It's great. I also like the tapes and play them in my car."
3,At least it's 30% off the cover price,"Granted Dell is one of the greatest success stories in computing history, however, chapter after chapter the same things were repeated over and over. After the first couple of chapters you can put the book down - there's nothing notable from then on."
2,BORING at the very best,"I really was expecting an Andy Grove's ""only the paranoid survive"" and was dissappointed that it was so dry and internal looking , with all the PR fluff and lack of personal perspective.Too narrative ...not enough focus on the external environment, what the market was doing at all those moments, how competitors tried to react, all the decisions and factors considered at various inflection points etc...Just a bunch of PR. Personally its a shame since its THE greatest success story ever, yet it lacks any juice for the million Dell fans. If the entire company functions like this with strong internal focus and execution I doubt this army of parochial worker ants , as successful as they have been, will be able to survive the impending sea of change he talks of in his book."
5,Get it & get with it! Ignore the negative reviewers!,"The negative reviewers likely found Dell's success too simple, too easy to be this good. Fact is, some of the most successful ideas are the simple ones. Dell's had his problems to be sure but the model of being Direct is as old as the hills only reinvented on a large scale by Michael Dell in modern times. If you can't learn from this book, then you simply can't learn or already know everything! It's a great book, a book I have given as a present several times. Well done Mr D!"
5,"Introducing ""Virtual Integration""...","A nice overview of an effective e-business model for aspiring ""virtualpreneurs."" Michael Dell might be the ""Webpreneur of the Century."" This book extends the concept of ""Virtual Integration"" that was described in a recent Harvard Business Review article. A must read!"
4,Lacks some depth but Overall A Winner,"The story of Michael Dell is fairly interesting and reinforces the direct model which is critical in today's business world. Mr. Dell was a very focused young man and had some defintie ideas regarding what he wanted out of life as a youth. It would have been interesting to elarn more about what motivated him to the success story that he is. He does repeat the Customer is King theory quite a bit. It is worth repeating but maybe with some more substance. None the less, Michael' story is a worthy read without being too long."
1,Shameless Dell infomercial,"I am a big fan of Dell and it's products, but this book is pretty poor.First, why in the world is dells web address printed 5 times at the bottom of each page? With over 225 pages, that is over 1200 times. The Dell advertising department should have paid me to read it. And given me the book.Of course, this book was published almost 10 years ago (1999). I am sure Dell would do a better job today.I wouldn't expect him to reveal too many pieces of useful information, lest he help the competition. But this was pretty light coverage of the facts."
3,Another Apple Co.,"What's so special about this book? I mean, all Dell doing is trying to bring more attention to his company now that the internet's stealing away his customers. Dell writes a very dull, dry, airy, and typical biography. Wow, say hi to Michael Dell.I think I'll wait for Bill Gate's next book (It comes out in March `99) BUSINESS @ THE SPEED OF THOUGHT"
2,Quality control,"In the copy I bought, one of the signatures (pp. 173-204) was bound upside down. Not sure if this makes the book a collector's item, but I sent it to the publisher for a replacement. Normally I would not mention this in a review, since it is obviously not Michael Dell's fault, but a major theme of his book is how Dell maintains quality control, especially from suppliers of subsystems that have the Dell name on them but otherwise do not go through Dell's physical hands. So it is relevant after all."
3,"Dell's tale is inspiring, but...","...can I be the one to suggest that the practices and principles that make Michael Dell a great success don't exactly make for scintillating reading?The first part of the book - the part that tracks the personal history and rise of Michael Dell - is wonderful stuff. Perhaps worthy of a 20+ page in-depth magazine profile. A ""Fast Company""-like piece, for example.But when the book turns to supply chain practices, and custom manfacturing techniques, and channel strategies, and fzkldj;sldg;dsfzmdfklsjmmdxvgfOops. Just nodded off a bit there...my head hit the keyboard. Sorry about that."
4,A book about one thing RESULTS!,"Dell's book isn't motivation it simply is cold hard basic know how with the one thing that counts in business - Results. He talks about several issues from the ill fated Olympia program to cutting out the stores. (Becha didn't know that Dell used to sell in stores around ten or so years ago!) He talks about simplifying processes in a basic manner. This isn't ""fuzzy math"" as a matter of fact it's fast reading. Highly recommended"
4,Excellent insight into how to use the web for business,"Excellent book on the growing pains of a company, plus how to use the web as a strategic tool for your business. There many lessons on what, and what not to do in business. I encourage this book for any company that is growing, and/or trying to figure out how to use the web as a strategic tool."
3,GOOD BUT NOT IN DEPTH,"There was a lot of repeating of ideas in this book. Just like the school I attend, it could be cut down into about one paragraph. Not very in depth, but good for beginners."
3,A great history of the PC!,"I actually enjoyed reading this book. It is a great history about the PC. It is entertaining written, and describes the story about a company, that did things different.This book is about reading the market, understanding the weaknesses of the market, and than comimg up with the right idea at the right time.If you want to read this book, because it is a book about the ""Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry"", well - I hope you like books about business history. But being that it is really good."
2,like all living era discs. the sound quallity is very bad,very disappointing disc. i do not recommand buyuing it.

1,Brand New and Keyboard was not working,"We purchased this for a Co Location facility and staged the equipment ahead of time. The equipment went in this weekend and the Keyboard on this brand new Console was not working. It was brand new so I should have tested it but I figured it was new and would work, it didn't. So now I have have something useless that cant be returned... Im not bashing the seller just the product, I would avoid if you can. Its not worth the chance of having to ship it back."
5,boy scout fun,I ordered this kit to add to a special cake for our Boy Scout advancement.Everyone got a kick out of it! well made and excellent detail. Beware parents of small children- many small parts!
5,Aznavour at Carnegi Hall,"This DVD was absolutely mesmerizing. The song selection was nicely varied between English, French and Spanish language. I have been fortunate enough to see his stage show in person, but in many ways this DVD was more fulfilling. I highly recommend it!"
5,A masterpiece about philosophical bases of liberal thought,"Hayek's classical book is against the totalitarians and their thought about legislation. He responses them saying that the legislation is not the tool to reconstruct the people and the economical relationships between them, but it is the method to explain the irrationally and naturally developping law more clearly. Additionally he argues the cartesian method of thinking because of its results which refuse the social evolution. Therefore Hayek finds the philosophical base of totalitarian thought in the belief that ""we can create the welfare with law, if we arrange it logically"". That's why he calls every kind of totalitarian thought as ""constructive cartesian rationalism"", because all of them want to reform the whole world, law and order from the beginning to realize their specific outcome like in DesCartes' method. (I think that it's the same as ""the social engineer"" description of Sir Karl Popper.)"
1,careful with the time of delivery,"delivery time, pay the shipment of 1 to 3 days, do not comply with it, buy it a day 18 and arrived 25 to the hotel. Of course my flight back to Venezuela was 24, Bone that the article did not get to my hands and I must now pay $ 100 to get me to venezuela"
4,Good book full of technic insight,"John Novello's Chapter three puts the art of music in perspective by making the student commit to a practice strategy. The practice strategy is key to this book because without it you probably won't get very far in your own music development. His pre-practice, practice, post-practice and playing operating standard is really good and should be a standard for every keyboard instructor. The book is very good and I would recommend it. It is over 550 pages long and I like the comb binding which is good for keyboardists. The only fault I can find with the book is the assignments section at the end of the chapters. I know for a lot of students, they would want a more concrete answer list somewhere so they could at least have confirmation of their own thinking to guide them towards a more productive experience with the book. This book is for the advanced keyboardist."
5,Better Than Expected!,"I bought this item during a one day sale for a fraction of retail, so it was worth it pretty much regardless of it's quality. This is worth every penny of full retail! I've seen these in the high-end boutique stores selling for upwards of $75, so the $25 that I paid was a huge bargain.It took less than 10 minutes to assemble and all you need is a phillips screwdriver. The directions, while not even really needed, are well written with diagrams.The best part is the fact that this comes with a blue wooden cover so after it's done being used as a potty chair, it looks very much like a regular child's chair. I was hoping it came with something like this and it did!I'm not sure if I just lucked out on shipping, but even with Super Saver shipping, it only took 2 business days to reach me."
5,Very fancy chair for a little boy.,"This potty chair has a top cover, therefore can be used as a kids chair, not just as potty chair. Very good quality, easy to assemble. Nice that you can customize it with a picture of your choice. A great gift for a kid who has enough toys..."
2,"No new songs. They need to change DJs. Boring, Boring, Bor","Since the previous reviewer seems to find novelty in the included tracks on this CD, maybe he's the one that needs to get out of his little world because all these tracks have been over plyed over and over. This MASTERBEAT always recycles the tracks after they've been heard everywhere else. Besides, they used one DJ exclusively. Very seldom, do they bring in a new DJ. I've been to Puerto Rico & I can vouch that they listen to a variety of new music, plus they listen to more than one genre not just recycled hits."
4,von weber german master,carl von weber is one of the best german composers that ever lived he is as good as mozart or bach but this composer has fallen into obscurity and i do not know why this recording is powerful and passionateif you are searching for wonderful german clarinet classical music order this disc now!! also check von webers symp 1&2
3,This Isn't Essential But Worth A Listen,"It's good recording of Blondie live intheir heyday but the concept and packaging is off a bit.The record company for whatever reason only uses pictures from the originlal line up of Blondie from thier visit to L.A. in 1976 and not from 1978 0r 1979 which is when these recording are from.Secondly, The concert featured here is split between to different sets. One from November of 1978 and the other from 1979 but is dated as 1980.I have no reason why they didn't just include the whole show but the songs here are great and com housed in a collectible package and have exclusive liner notes."
5,"A must read, especially for the new homeschooler.","This is a VERY helpful book. I am easily overwhelmed by the shear number of curriculum choices and this book helped narrow my range of choices based on learning styles. The descriptions of the reviewed materials are quite helpful. The author also suggested writing a Philosophy of Education, which really clarified the direction I wanted to take with the education of my children. I highly recommend this book, but make sure you read the introductory chapters and answer the questions/write your own philosophy for your family; otherwise, I don't think it will be as beneficial."
4,Cathy Duffy's popular homeschool picks,"This is well organized, clearly written. Her criteria is clearly stated & she writes unpretensiously. I thought it was a great referance book. Especially since she gave great reviews for the KONOS curriculum. Actually, everything that I own she reviewed with great reviews. I think you would buy this book to have a guide on hand before you make future purchases. :)"
2,Not nearly as comprehensive as I had hoped,"Although she has a lot of good information about various curricula, it has a great emphasis on Christian homeschooling. I wish it had that intention stated in the subtitle or in the introduction. I was looking for more alternatives, such as information on Waldorf, or Montessori homeschooling alongside the Classical and other well known options."
3,Good IF you are looking for fundamentalist Christian choices,"This would be a great book if only she had offered some secular choices. The book was well organized. I love the intro on learning styles and there's a great chart that summarizes all her choices (although I wish she had indicated age appropriateness).I am Christian, but this book was definitely written for fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers. I am a first time homeschooler and the book was useful in selecting the subjects that are more secular by nature - like reading & math. And while I like her Charlotte Mason approach to science and history, I was dissapointed with the lack of non-Creationist choices. If you are looking for Creationist choices, this would be good. If you are looking for secular science and history, this book is not for you."
1,Misleading title. LONG title should've stated it's a Christian book.,"This is a Christian book just like The Story of the World. I am disappointed at the deception.""100 Top Picks for Homeschool Curriculum: Choosing the Right Curriculum and Approach for Your Child's Learning Style""The extraordinarily long title didn't have the word ""Christian"" squeezed in. One can find out it is a Christian book only once they read it. Books written by followers of other religions seem to respect the reader and don't have this kind of hidden agenda. Cathy Duffy reminds me of missionaries who travel to third world countries who give food to the poor with the Bible. As a homeschooling parent who gives much importance to critical thinking, I feel cheated and am upset. Homeschoolers are not ""Christian"", but there are Christian homeschoolers too- we must remember this.I recommend this book to Christians alone."
4,A great help but not completely thorough,"I have just about completed my first year homeschooling my boys. Before we began this year I was feeling very overwhelmed by the amount of options available to homeschoolers. This book helped me understand the main methods of homeschooling and helped me find some books to get started with the task. Since then I have found several books and at least one method that is gaining popularity that wasn't mentioned in the book at all (and I wish it would have been as I really like it). This book is a great jumping off point and I always recommend it to new homeschoolers to use to get started. Hopefully soon there will be an updated version released, as several of the books I had looked for on her list I could not find in print."
2,"A better title would be ""Top 100 Christian Picks""","This book does pretty comprehensively look at the Christian homeschooling curricula, but doesn't touch at all on non-Christian possibilities. I was hoping for some information on K12, for example. It got a half-sentence mention in relation to another product. Other well known and well respected programs aren't mentioned at all.The author expresses some distrust of non-Creationist science, and stresses the importance of Bible instruction.I was very disappointed in the book, and feel misled by the reviews. It's not at all a help to a thinking person looking at all the possibilities, not only the fundamentalist Christian ones."
2,can't view the charts,ok...really loving this book...however i canNOT view the charts on my kindle...which is the main purpose of having this book!!! the charts are too small to be able to be seen. sooo annoying!!!anyway...love the book...but only giving 2 stars because it's worthless on a kindle!
2,A Christian Viewpoint,"I chose this book because of the good reviews it received, however none of them mentioned that it has an overtly Christian viewpoint and many of the top picks use bible verses, etc. as a part of the daily curriculum. I am a secular homeschooler and would prefer a guide with a more neutral viewpoint. Others may find this viewpoint helpful, but I wish the reviews had revealed it before I purchased the book."
4,"Useful information, but NOT for kindle.","I like the content of the book, it is one of the must-read books if you are new to homeschooling IMHO. However, a lot of the [essential] charts and tables are impossible to read on the kindle, I had to read it on the cloud reader, print screen, enlarge, put it in a word document, and print it, before I can make use of them. I have return the kindle version and plan to get the paper back later."

3,Dimensions incorrect,This item is very pretty but it is barely long enough to cover my fireplace opening. I have to have it flat against the fireplace . It looks awkward. I don't know why they put these measurements because it is no where close to being that big....
2,Will probably be returning it,"I should have done research on MDF fiberboard before I bought this. It is basically wood particles bound together with formaldehyde, and this screen smells like it. I've left it out in the back yard the last couple days, hoping the noxious smell will go away. So far it has only lessened a bit. If by tomorrow I can't leave it in a shut room overnight without the entire room reeking the next morning, this is going back.Looks nice enough and would have fulfilled my purpose for it (too small to block an average size fireplace, but large enough to hide some plumbing I don't want showing in my finished basement). I'm not willing to get cancer for it though. Formaldehyde is a known carciongen, which is why it amazes me that people tolerate this stuff being put in home products. Read this wikipedia article on fiberboard's composition for more details: [...]"
3,poorly made,"Love the design, it is too cute. I use it to conceal my cats litter boxes in our family room. It really hides them and adds to the decor, however, it is poorly made, the hinges for folding are sooo cheap and were all bent and distored due to being too small for the heaviness of the screen and the size of the box it was delivered in! It came in a box twice the size of the screen with only a small little bubble pack inserted over the top of the picket fence. Maybe that is how the hinges got so bent? Do not know, but they are too small to hold the weight of the screen. After a lot of work, my husband was able to repair the damage and it looks great...."
4,good product for the money,"This fireplace screen is relatively inexpensive. For the price, it looks surprisingly nice. Definitely serves it's function, hiding the fireplace from my toddlers. Prior to this, my son would constantly throw his toys into the fireplace!"
5,"Another fun filled show, great to have it as part of the series","A Spoof Odyssey is a great part of the Forbidden Broaday series. Such sharp writing and again a super cast of singers. A joy to listen to, which I do often."
4,It could have been better.,"liked this book, I liked the hero, I didn't like the heroine. I don't know what it was about her that I didn't like. I think she was just too whiny, and she just didn't measure up to the hotness of the hero Christopher. I give it a B-"
3,Not what I expected.....rather disappointing,"First of all, I would like to say that I absolutely adored ""Penelope and Prince Charming"" from this Author. So, I rushed out and got the first book with a cute catchy title from her. To say the least, I was disappointed.The chemistry that was in her other book lacked completely here. The hero was rather bland (How do you make a bland pirate, for goodness sake!) and the heroine, for lack of better word, was whiny. I found myself more interested in the neighbors (who have their own book) and the brother of the heroine (who has his own book). Now, there was sex (This author KNOWS how to write a good sensual scene!) but without the chemistry that makes a romance a romance, it was kind of... cheap.Perhaps if I read the stories in order, I would like ""Care and Feeding."" As for now, I will continue to read Ashley novels, but I'm not sure what to expect now. I recommend her ""Penelope and Prince Charming"" so much more."
4,"Why, oh why???","Why is it that a book will have a great hero but the heroine doesn't measure up? I feel that that is what happened in The Care and Feeding of Pirates. Christopher was to die for. He was great. I loved the way he was written, but Honoria left me cold. I didn't like the way she came across and I never warmed up to her. I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about her, but maybe it was that I didn't feel she admitted her love for Christopher soon enough. To be a great book, it has to click on all cylinders and Honoria, for me, bogged this one down."
4,The Care and Feeding of Pirates,"On the verge of marrying, Honoria could not be more shocked when Christopher Raine returns from the dead. The infamous pirate was believed to have been hung, but news of Honoria's pending nuptuals prompts him to return and claim his secret wife. Though at first he intends to let her go, if her fiance truly loves her, seeing her changes his mind. Besides, he needs her help in rescuing his sister, Manda, and reclaiming a lost treasure. At first, Honoria is shocked and begs for her freedom, but the old flames have not died, and presently, she is even more in love than she ever was with Christopher.*** Christopher is a truly engaging hero, who leaps off the page in vivid color. Adventure and excitement combine with romance to make for a winning adventure that will breeze past all too rapidly. ***Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,RODI RULES !,"OK - It's my turn!! Here I was stuck for a month in some ridiculous backwater business assignment so I took a chance and bought all the Rodi books to keep me company. The GayMuse of Entertainment was watching over me! This guy is literate, amusing, profound, and definitely has the ear of his audience. I could go on and on about all his books: comparing & contrasting & up-thumbing and down-thumbing... but the bottom line is that this man WRITES with a wit and wisdom that is oh! so rare in Gay Fiction today. Now do a little 'search' here at amazon.com on 'rodi' and pluck up anything that pops up. I guarantee you that you will be pleased... if not just a little bit moved!"
3,Predictable But Fun in the End,"This book takes some time to get into. The first half is rather boring with the occaisonal funny circumstantial humor. Lionel is in the closet at work and everywhere else, except to his downstairs neighbor. Most of the book naturally revolves around the crazy things that come up as Lionel tries desperately to keep it that way. The book picks up halfway through and the wacky ending helps it to redeem itself. The story is very predictable, but you find yourself almost glad that things are turning out the way they do. Good for a fun light read."
2,"Not the end, but close","After this I pretty much knew it was over for Shooting Star. After the band's first two albums I had this band pegged for superstardom, but weak efforts on III Wishes and Burning doomed them to also-ran status. Too bad. In this case, Straight Ahead started things off as strongly as anything they'd ever done, but after that the well was dry. A fairly pedestrian run through of the old Motown chestnut Reach Out I'll Be There was of interest to anyone who might have been a fan of Gary West's voice, but that was it. 1981 seemed a lot farther away than only two years in 1983. 1985 would bring another token effort, but the title of this album pretty well says it all about the career of Kansas City's favorite sons, and that's sad."
2,lost it's giggle after a month,"would have been a nice toy but it lost the giggle noise it should make when rolled. for that reason I can't recommend this to anyone else. We bought this for christmas 11' and just a short time after it did not giggle. This was for a 6 month old so it was nothing he did to the toy, just defective and not even woth the price."
3,a slight disappointment,"All of the tracks on the cd are good but they lack something and that something is what makes Mark II so much better. The hooks aren't as good and the back up vocals can get annoying and repetitive on a few of the middle tracks. Perhaps it is the lack of traditional melody along with the lyrics and music in the songs, or perhaps not. It also seems to have a more consistent club beat whereas Mark II is more subtle with the electronic beats on most songs. Volven is amusing but doesn't compare to The Raven and none compare to the beauty of The Man and the Elf Girl or Venelite. I am by no means going to toss the disc aside or write it or the band off. As I said, there is some good stuff on III (Ulver, Ramund, Linden, Tor af Hafsgaard, and Dagmar---the middle to end tracks) but I do like Mark II much better."
4,Old Catholic,As a new member to the Old Catholic Churchand a future seminarian i found this bookvery helpful i think Bishop Queen did a greatjob .
4,"Great recipes, Handsome book, good gift","This is an attractive book with mouth-watering recipes for shrimp-lovers of all types. It will certainly give you many menu ideas, from New Orleans Shrimp Ramoulade, to oriental coconut shrimp, to the elegant ""Martini Shrimp Cocktail"" pictured on the cover. I have enjoyed my copy so much that I have bought additional copies as gifts. Enjoy! Bon Apetit!"
2,Useless for large fruits.,"We ordered this juicer after reading all the reviews carefully and thought that it will be a good juicer. we opened it as soon as it arrived in mail and we tried to juice few medium sized oranges and a normal sized Grapefruit. There was lot of pulp left stuck to the oranges. In case of Grapefuits, only about 25% of the fruit was juiced and rest of the pulp was left stuck to the fruit. We tried to use the lever multiple times but nothing happened. May be a good juicer for lemons, limes and very small oranges but for medium and large sized fruits, it is useless."
2,"soviet design -- bulky, heavy, and imprecisely put together","This juicer is extremely heavy, made of industrial type metal parts, but it's poorly machined and assembled. The heavy parts don't fit together well, and the juicer is wobbly and unstable, despite it's heaviness. I am sending this back without using it once, becuase there's no way to adjust the parts, and it's too unstable to use as is. Also, it really is almost impossible to pick up and move, due to the weight, without straining your back. Finally, like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer, I find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant, and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places. It seem like the kind of company where to get a good product, you'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one."
2,Poor quality of juice,"I was considering buying this. Luckily a friend let me borrow his first. It is well made, heavy duty and worked well with all size citrus. I juiced a gallon of orange juice quickly and easily.I was ready to buy it. Then I drank the juice. There is was too much oil from the skin. I don't think you can use a press type juicer without getting citrus oil in your juice. I also really like a lot of pulp in my juice. With the juice press you get no pulp. I juiced the next half gallon with a reamer type juicer. It took a little longer but the quality of the juice, in my opinion, was way superior."
3,Juice strainer basket hard to remove for cleaning,"I've had the mid-size OrangeX for a week or so and I really like almost everything about it. The problem I'm having is that the strainer basket gets stuck into its holder. Since the basket needs to be removed for cleaning this is a problem. I'm playing with rubber gaskets and washers to solve the problem, but it is a big nuisance. The OrangeX that I saw and liked, so much that I bought my own, did not have this problem. Maybe it will cure itself with age and wear."
4,"Works well,but, the funnel does not come out easily for cleaning","The unit works just as it is described. Gets alot of juice out of the citrus used. BUT, the funnel that holds the inverted cone gets jammed into its holder making it hard to clean. This would be my only complaint. the funnel does clean with a paper towel while still in the unit, it would just be easier if it came out easier."
4,heavy duty juicer,"My husband loves fresh squeezed orange juice but hated the mess the electric juicer made. He also didn't want any pulp in his juice. I bought him a Mighty Mack manual juicer which lasted a little over a year because it wasn't sturdy enough for the force it takes to press the juice out of the orange. This juicer, although big and a bit bulky, does a great job. I like the suction cups on the feet so it doesn't move. And yes, the handle will hit you in the head if you don't put it back in the starting position. It gets only 4 stars because of it's size and bulk and that you can't really throw it in the dishwasher."
2,Would Not Buy,"I saw this in a store, and I agree with others that it is bulky and loose and not well made. The handle does not stay up, and I almost lost a finger right there in the store. Since you need to leave the handle up to insert an orange, this seems like a pretty bad oversight.I have not tried the juice from this machine, maybe it is delicious, but I would not risk losing appendages for it."
1,OrangeX CitrusJuicer,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the juicer I purchased. The handle would not stay up and it was easy to crush your fingers, bad if young children were using it. The top would not stay in. The rubber feet left black marks on the formica (poor quality rubber). I sent mine back for refund. E-mailed the company but they would not respond, sign of a poor company!"
4,works with lemons and limes,I've had this for over a year and it is great. It is well made and I love that I don't not have to use my hands anymore. You have to really look under the hinges to clean it after each use. Another thing is that you have to keep the hinges oiled so that it does not rust. I use cooking oil so that I do not leave something toxic in my juice. Works great with lemons and limes and that is what I bought it for.
3,"Solid, but not perfect","Ordered this for my wife for Xmas since we just got a place with an orange tree and I was getting tired of pressing on the electic juicer. Overall the press works better, but the actual stainless steel sieve comes loose too easily and often lifts up since it isn't securely held in place by the small dimples. I requested a new cup/sieve combination and the manufacturer said they would look into it, but then I haven't heard anything for a couple weeks. Little disappointed in their responsiveness to remediating the problem since I'm just asking for a new small part. I've also had to tighten the juicer up a bit using allen wrenches since it has come a bit loose after about 500 oranges. Not a big deal, but not quite as 'commercial' strength as I would like. Not completely disappointed/but not wowed given the reasonably high price."
2,Sketchy Design,"I expected better performance for such an expensive juice press. The biggest issue has to do with the fit and finish of the cup and strainer cone. The cup and strainer cone fit very loosely and as a result they frequently separate on the upstroke because of the suction created between the press/fruit skin/strainer. A lot of time is spent reassembling the cup and cone while juicing. Also, the cup needs higher walls to contain the squirting juices. Some of the suction and squirting issues are remedied by cutting the fruit into quarters instead of halves. It works best with small to medium sized fruit (no luck with large grapefruit). Be sure to pull the lever down not toward you or the juice press will want to tip over. That being said, I will keep the juice press as it works reasonably well when the fruit is quartered and it is easy to clean. For the cost they should work out some of the bugs though."
5,Orange juice squeezer,What I liked:1-Easy to clean.2-Easy to set up.3-Easy to use.What I changed:1-It comes with 4 screw-on suction cups on the bottom which were a nuisance. I replaced them with stick-on bumpers which can be bought at any hardware store and now I can easily move it on the kitchen counter. The new rubber bumpers give it just the right movement resistance.I use it to squeeze two glasses of juice each morning and other times I squeeze a quart to a half gallon. It can be used either way since the clean-up is easy.Richard Link
2,Bitter juice,"This juicer is a big disappointment.The juice is consistently very bitter. To mitigate the bitterness, I place a cotton cloth over the back of the orange. Still bitter. In spite of its heft, it is still necessary to hold it down while operating. I agree with those who complain about the danger if the handle is left in the upright position - it's easy to forget to lower it. It should have some sort of catch that will not allow it to fall. This is a simple fix. It's inexcusable not to take care of this. The reamer and tray are rather flimsey and don't stay put very well.I could put up with the other design problems if the juice was good. But this juicer makes bitter juice. Period. I've tried it on Florida juicing oragnges and on navel oranges. Same story."
5,Strong and effective,"I'm obsessed with fresh-squeezed orange juice. The fancy grocery store near my apartment sells they bottled version of fresh squeezed orange juice. I'll admit, their's is better than the commercial brands. Do your research, the commercial stuff can be more than a year old, and LOADED with additives for freshness and taste, despite what the bottle says.The Jupiter commercial press is the real deal. It's heavy and strong. You don't have to worry about it breaking on you, that's for sure. It's also very easy to clean. I can't say enough about it. Anyone who likes good orange juice, or good lemonade, or good limeade, or any other citrus for that matter, should invest in one of these. Well worth it!"
3,Good book,"I do believe it is a pretty good book. It has been a while and it doesn't stand out in my head a lot but it is probably ok. I ordered it and don't remember being mad I ordered it so its probably ok. It's written by the guy who wrote ""The Last Detail"" and I really like that one so hopefully this one is ok even though I don't really remember."
2,Not a Good Idea (A Very Pazza Idea),"If, like me, you crave for some nice Italian Pop, back from the seventies, you'd be ill advised to buy this CD. It mangles and synthesizes the hell out of some good songs, plus the recording is not of very good quality. If you want a good collection of songs by this singer, you're better off buying ""Gli Anni 70"". (See my review)"
2,Hard to 'Dive' into,"I purchased this book from Amazon as I do all my books. I found the story acceptable, but it had a hard time keeping my interest while reading. Sea story's have been my favorite since a kid but can only give this book 2 stars. I felt it could have used more action and less dialogue. Also I found the young girls dialogue, especially the one in love with Doc, a little unreal. You may really enjoy this book but wanted to give another readers perspective."
4,5 star if Zappa and Beethoven had been aborted,Far beyond the written material available.Lovely arctic shamanic rites mate with desert storytellers staging a coup on Greenpeace's late 70's sellout.This is the faith of the 90's. 2190's that is.
5,Great book,"I wanted a better understanding of day-to-day life in Colonial Virginia, from the founding of Jamestown forward to 1776. I also wanted a better understanding of the origins of slavery in Virginia. Mr. Morgan brings this information home in staggering detail, yet his writing style makes it an ""easy read"". The research that must have gone into this book is truly amazing, as reflected by the thorough footnotes and citations. Though I am no expert myself, an amateur history buff at best, I was certainly left with the impression that this is THE definitive book on the history of colonial Virginia. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this topic."
4,Racism,"To be sure, this book deals with the paradox of a nation trying to liberate themselves from the British while they, the Patriots, themselves hold slaves. But, Morgan also hits on a big topic of the evlotuion of racism through the history of colonial Virginia. This book is a great narrative for what Morgan accomplishes, it is very informative and after your done with the book it makes you think and say to yourself, ""hey, what is he saying!"" See for yourself."
5,Best U.S. History Book I've Ever Read,"Among the overexposed idealouges, you have Schweikart, on on the other hand you have Zinn. Sadly, an author like Morgan, who seems to have no agenda other than the truth, gets a little overlooked.This book reads like a densely written novel. I couldn't put it down.This book functions like thourough preamble to the U.S. Civil War- it gave me a level of understanding that continues to surprise me.If you read only one book on American History, let this be the one."
4,Fast-paced game for preschoolers,"This game challenges preschoolers to quickly find as many matching pairs of socks as possible in a big pile of similar socks. The socks are similar enough that even an adult has to look carefully to identify the matching pairs. My 3.5 year old son enjoys this game and is able to play it without much difficulty. Obviously, I have to adjust my speed when playing with him because I can identify matches considerable faster than he can. In that sense, the game is a little less enjoyable for an adult than, say, Memory where my son and I are much more evenly matched. The educational value of the game is mainly limited to sharpening observation skills and practicing self-control (i.e. not grabbing similar socks that are not exact matches). Children need to recognize colors and do some simple counting but they will need to have already mastered these skills in order to play this game."
5,"Great practice, great fun!","Our preschooler LOVES to play this game with us, and wants to take the adorable wooden monster everywhere with her! And we're always happy to share toys, books, and games with her that don't tout highly marketed characters like Disney, Dora, Bob the Builder, Barbie, etc.The only downside is that she desperately wants to clip a pair of the sturdy laminated paperboard socks together once she's earned a clothesline clip, and the socks are too thick for that. Nonetheless, as with every Haba product we've tried, we're thoroughly pleased."
2,Disappointing,Thos was apparenty an amateur stage production. Not particularly well done. A good effort on their part but needed a lot of improvement.
3,Libro de aprendizaje básico,"Explica bien y clarifica el interprete para saber todo lo necesario y programar.Para programadores con experiencia, se necesitaría algo más fuerte con ejemplos más cercanos a las necesidades del mercado. Claro que hay varias versiones de PHP, asi que en lo que respecta a lo general y para aprender o tener una guía de referencia de los comantos, sintasis, esta muy bien, especialmente porque viene en español."
3,OK,"OK tool, although in hindsight I would have chosen a chromed tool instead. I worry about rusting on this uncoated tool. The description on line could have been more detailed. The picture on line seems to show a chrome tool. It is not, but is machined steel apparently uncoated. I have many great Proto tools, which Stanley has apparently taken over. Too bad - Proto was great."
2,What a mess!,"There seems to be no way to use this grinder without making a HUGE mess! Coffee grounds end up all over the counter, stuck to the outside and caught in the chambers of the grinder... We had a Braun burr grinder for 10 years that worked so well without making a mess, so it's a big disappointment to have replaced it with this. As for the main function of the grinder: other consumers seem to have problems with it grinding beans for espresso, but for drip coffee we don't have problems with it being too fine or too coarse."
2,Messy machine,"I've had my Pavoni burr grinder for over a month now. Try as I might, I get ground coffee and coffee dust on the counter, on my hands, and in the sink (over which I transfer it to the filter basket) every time I use it. It spits a fine coffee dust during grinding since there's not a tight seal around the ground coffee catcher. Ground coffee doe not come out easily since there is an electrostatic charge generated that makes coffee stick to the catcher. I'm not sure if the grind selector is even effective: I get both fine and coarse coffee regardless."
2,The inevitability of change,"This is my third La Pavonia Burr Grinder over the past 20 years or so. I have mixed feelings about this one. While there are some really nice improvements in the design e.g. better feed hopper and reduced noise, the overall quality of the materials used in production appear to be inferior to what was used to build earlier models. Specifically, the most likely components to break ie. the hopper lid and the removeable coffee bin are made of a very light plastic polymer that appears to be fragile. I believe that this grinder will have a much shorter lifecycle than its predecessors.Post Script: This grinder self-distructed in July 2010. The electrical motor just quit. The useful life on this grinder was very short as expected. I replaced it with a Black & Decker Burr grinder that is far superior in design and overall product quality at about half the price."
2,Disappointment,"This Lapavoni grinder has been a big disappointment. While it is supposed to have 19 grinding settings (from 19 - very coarse- to 1 - very fine), the selector wheel will not turn lower than 3, producing ground coffee that is still too coarse to make really good espresso. If you want to grind coarsely ( say for a French press), the Lapavoni will produce very favorful coarsely ground coffee. One problem on all grinding settings is that the grinder tends to spew small amounts of ground coffee on your countertop while grinding. I contacted the importer of the grinder and they were very helpful (e-mailed me suggestions for making it work properly, etc.), but it still doesn't work properly. I will probably be returning it to the importer for warranty repairs."
4,Good Espresso after tweaking,"As others have commented, this grinder does not grind fine enough for espresso out of the box. However, it is fairly easy to tweak the grinder to go finer. I can now grind fine enough to choke my espresso machine.To tweak: simply undo the three screws inside the bean hopper. Lift the top off. Adjust the setting to 1 (finest), then lift the adjusting wheel out and reposition to a new setting (I used 7). Reassemble the machine, and now you can go several steps finer. I use a setting four or five steps past 1 for my espresso.I am not a coffee snob, but I do enjoy the taste of the 25 second espresso shots that I have achieved with the tweaked grinder."
3,You get what you pay for,"This burr grinder is much better than the cheap whirling blade type of coffee grinder. The controls really do make it easy to grind just the amount of coffee you need, and the coarseness selector does allow for different grinds. However, I normally grind for only 2 cups of coffee to be made in a French Press. When grinding on the coarse setting, it does spit out the coarse coffee grinds but it also spits out about a teaspoon of very finely ground coffee at the same time. This means my cup of coffee from the French Press ends up with ""coffee mud"" on the bottom. I am going to return the grinder and try one of the expensive Braun models instead."
1,Phooey with this machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The very first time I used this worthless machine was indicative of what was to come. A cloud of coffee dust surrounded the machine, and this was on a course grind. I hate to think of what an espresso lover is in for. I am back to using my old reliable Braun. The La Pavoni machine will be dumped on an unsuspecting offspring."
2,Not for serious grinding,"This burr grinder was not designed for espresso machines as it cannot grind the coffee fine enough.For regular coffee, it is adequate.Cleanup is a big mess since you cannot run water through the chamber, so you must manually remove the burr an attempt to clean the chamber.The only positive is that it is a burr, so the coffee doesn't get mashed with blades."
4,Burr coffer grinder,I've only used this product a few times for whole bean coffee works fine. I was concerned at first from some negitive reviews but for grinding coffee it's great. Was using a Braun for the last 3 years worked great only reason for the change needed a white grinder to go with the rest of our decor. I like the one touch feature my only complaint could use a larger area to hold unground beans
5,coffee lover,I love this coffee burr grinder. I especially like the way you can take the burr grinder and clean it each time you use it. I believe anybody that likes this kind of coffee grinder will like this one.
1,No Good for Course Grind (French Press),"""The"" reason I bought this grinder was for course ground for my French press. This grinder mixes in finely ground coffee with the course grind. I get accumulation of fine ground at top corner of the collection bin, on top of the coursely ground coffee. This makes icky coffee using a Fr. press. Whereas coffee ground in a store results in properly course ground coffee for my press.Pavoni tech support (in New York - not Italy) (okay he had a NY Italian accent and tried to be helpful), tried to convince me the problem was my choice of coffee (i.e. large coffee retailer whose roasting makes their beans too oily. I tried some other brands but same problem. The grinder clearly shoots out finely ground coffee mixed in with the course grind. Cleaning the blades, etc. did not help. This gringer is a No-Go for use with French press."
4,I really like it!,"The reason I purchased this grinder 4 months ago was to grind coarse coffee. My little one-speed Braun grinds too fine for me. This grinder does the trick. Is it noisy? Yes, but not that much worse than my other one. Is it messy? Yes, but it's worth it. Is the coarse adjustment tempermental? Yes, so tweak it. Do the beans hang up in the drop chute? Yes, so shake it. I get to grind 2 or 3 pots of coffee at once, which I do because I drink coffee all day long, at a grind I like. I think that's good as long as I don't expect professional results from a $35 grinder. Some people's reviews were a little on the demanding side. If you want professional results, buy a $400 grinder like they have at Moxie's."
2,Only scores in looks...,"I was really looking forward to this LaPavoni grinder so when it turned out to be a dud it was a big disappointment to me.My previous grinder worked fine for a few years. Maybe the best thing about that machine was it didn't over-promise -- the only thing you could adjust was the coarseness of the grind, and that worked fine.The La Pavoni promises to grind the ""right amount per cup"" and has settings for that but unfortunately those are totally fictitious! It's ""fine to coarse"" grind scale is equally ridiculous, all it manages to produce is coffee ground medium-fine to dust-fine. It also somehow manages to spray ground coffee on the counter. In brief, it irritates me each and every morning!! I can get there without buying a grinder."
1,wouldn't recommend it,"Product does a poor job of grinding coffee fine enough for either press or filter process. Grinds fast but rather course, generally I have had to run it through twice and it is still too course."
4,So far its great,This is my first burr grinder (have had blade grinders). Much richer coffee! This grinder has settings that take the guess work out of grinding and it doesn't leave a mess. It is easy to clean. I just hope that it is durable.
1,Works great! Fails quickly.,This grinder grinds well but failed after just 2 months of operation. Don't buy it unless you want to waste your money.
2,bad plastic,"The grinder part of the product works fine. The problem seems to be the plastic parts. Very soon after I started using it, the lower plastic container devoloped cracks, which eventually broke off. I tried to patch the holes up with tape, but that was pretty ineffective. It really bothers me to have to discard a perfectly good grinder because apparently I cannot replace the broken plastic piece. I suppose that's called the 'American Way', so I'm forced to buy another grinder even tho the one I have is not actually broken. I find this to be extremely annoying!"
4,Bix at his very best,A wonderful collection of the best of Bix Beiderbecke. Bix was one of a kind and his cornet really shines on this CD.
2,A Disappointment,"In an apparent attempt to be balanced, the author offers no opinions or perceptions of various areas. Often, you can't tell which area is hotter, which is mountainous or flat. In other words, there is virtually no sense of place, which is exactly what I was looking for.I was looking for information about parts of the state I hadn't seen, and got a lot less than I wanted."
3,Disappointing Guide,"I would not consider this a ""COMPLETE Guide to Retiring in New Mexico."" I was hoping it would include specific retirement communities in different areas of New Mexico -- not just descriptions of the areas. The book needs to be updated."
3,"Powerful sounding stun gun is all bark, very little bite","I wouldn't rely on this device to keep my wife safe, but it does have the chance to scare off a would be bad guy with the sound alone. I finally got brave enough after a bit of liquid courage to shock myself, and while it actually left a small burn mark and made me jump, I don't think it would stop me if I really wanted to keep moving."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"price was good , description was good, BUT the description was just a flat out LIE , these people do not know the difference between metal and plastic , product description; "" rigid metal body "" IT'S PLASTIC , ripp-off, I will not ever buy anything from this seller again !!!!!!!!"
3,acceptable,"got this a couple of months ago but it wasn't the same as the pictures but it works fine charged it 2twice in about 5months and it's still working. The only problem is it kind of feels cheap, the buttons wiggle and you cant use the flashlight and the stun gun in the same time. Also when you charge it you dont really know when it's completely charged.Shock is STRONG makes a looot of noise but the quality isn't all that so if your looking for something cheap and u dont really care about the quality go for it!"
1,Not worth the money,"If you are looking for a stun gun disguised as a flashlight don't bother with this. Buy the upgraded version. It's twice the cost but actually looks and functions like a flashlight. This version has a plastic cap that covers the prongs, so in addition to the safety, you have to remove the plastic cap in order to utilize the stun gun capabilities. It's made of cheap plastic and looks like it will break if you drop it. In addition, the stun prongs are quite dramatic and are not at all disguised, even with the plastic cap on. Also, I would recommend that Guard Dog refrain from displaying their name so prominently on their products. It is easily recognizable and anyone who knows the brand will know what capabilities that it infers, so the idea of disguising its stun capabilities, in the form of a flashlight, are negated."
3,"Ok, Just barely....","I bought this after seeing one at the bar where I work. I thought it would be good to have since I need a flashlight a lot and I deal with drunk people. Out of the box the stun gun worked great, However the switch for the light was loose and after a few minutes the light wouldn't come on at all. I have seen this as a problem in other reviews. I also see that many people don't seem to have this problem. Quality control must not be very good at all. Buy this if you are willing to possibly exchange a bad one for a good one and fool with the hassle. For my money I am upgraded to the diablo which seems to be much better made."
5,Don't tase me bro!!!,It's like a bolt of lighting with a flash light.It is quite terrifying. :oOnly down side is you can't have the flashlight on and tase at the same time.
3,an elephant gun,"Well built but way too much iron just to squeeze oranges. Squeezing cone too small to accept grapefruits. Works smoothly, but find a storage area just below the work area or you'll get a hernia lugging the thing around the kitchen. The mid-size should be just fine if you like this concept. It is exactly what you think it will be, and I'm sorry I bought it."
2,So very misleading,"One of the reasons I bought this expensive juicer was because of the ""Large-size Commercial"" part - I was looking to squeeze 2 - 3 gallons at a time. The Amazon review also talks about grapefruits and efficiency with large quantities of fruit. I love sweet Texas grapefruit - they just barely fit, with pulp and seeds easily passing into the juice. The extractor insert doesn't lock in place and comes out after several squeezes with the rind. And only short glasses fit underneath to catch the juice. Large quantities (more than one small glass) are a continuous stop and pour and put the extractor screen back in, and then strain the end product process. If you are only doing a few oranges, than it is just ok - so call it a really expensive not very efficient orange juicer. I'm disappointed.Ps. All the reviews about the long wait were true."
4,Amazon customer service,This juicer is a great product if you are able to get it delivered. I was waiting for the blue one which just did not come. I contacted customer service 11!!! times and never heard back from them.the way amazon treats its customers is very annoying but obviously nothing new.Finally I ordered another color that was available.
1,have yet to receive this item,expect at least 2 to 3 month before receiving this item. i ordered in early may and have yet to receive this item. the only thing i have received is notices stating that the order is delayed.
1,Paint particles -- part of a balanced diet?,"This machine is built like a Russian tank - what it lacks in finesse it tries to make up for in sheer bulk. But the massive, retro-industrial design is not enough to earn a place on your countertop. My juicer arrived with several dings in the paint. The stainless steel dome that the fruit is crushed on had a black greasy substance on the underside. It took a lot of scouring to get rid of this material of unknown toxicity. The shape of the squeezing surfaces is conical rather than hemispherical. The effect of this is that the discarded rind always includes some unsqueezed pulp. But the worst feature of the unit I received is that two of the painted surfaces of the mechanism rub against each other during use causing a fine powder of paint flecks to fall into the juice. The toxicity of these paint flecks is unknown to me but I sure don't want to ingest them. It's going back."
3,"strong suction, but a bit flimsy and gets hot","strong suction for a small vacuum cleaner. several attachments. however, the carrying strap is no good. the clasps wouldn't hold and then the plastic attachments on the body of the vacuum cleaner broke. it also gets hot very fast and is a little uncomfortable to hold against your body as you carry it on the strap."
3,Good suction for little jobs,"I bought this last week and it's a great little plastic vacuum. It is good for small jobs and getting around things that the big vacuum can't get to and in corners. I don't really think the suction would hold up a 12 pound bowling ball, but yet I don't have a bowling ball to try it on.It gets the dog hair off of the furniture very well and it cleans my blinds good."
3,Not quite what I was expecting but it was fresh :),"I like the taste of Twizzlers...and well, this was a totally different tastebut being attached to an Aussie, lol I wanted to try his flavors etc. The black is better in this...this came fresh and its ok-just a different taste than what we get over here. You may like it-just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,Cheap merchandising trick,"I notice that this game has now been reduced to $5; that is probably all its worth. However if you have a copy of Unreal, Unreal Tournament, Half Life Counterstrike or any other game with online team play then you've already got a better game so dont bother!It all sounded great, marketed off the back of the extemely good Terminator 3 film I was expecting much. The reality was much worse when I found out it was a poor man's Unreal Tournament. Sure there are terminators and humans and there is variety of ""domination"" style scenarios (capture most of the areas for longest to win). The sniper rifle is most definitely the weapon of choice and can take down a terminator with one head shot - nice. But its so been done, and done better. I did play through all the scenarios and satisfied myself I could do it and then I uninstalled it and put it away for ever :o(."
2,Don't buy me.,"The game lacks alot. It even lacks support from Atari, the developer who's main page online is literally a picture. It is suppose to be supported by GameSpy, it is not, there no dedicated servers by Atari or the developer. The game has potential but unless these issues are resoloved, IE:graphic problems, lack of storyline, mulitplayer issues, this game is dead in the water."
2,Misleading Packaging!!,There are no single player missions- just some lame maps you choose and fight weak AI robots. The multi player is OK but I was pissed about the fact that the box promises single player missiins and there are none. No clear beginning or end.Dont waste your money!!
5,love it,I like this game as it is the only multiplayer game of any quality that immerses you into the world of skynet/techcom. There are no dedicated servers and joining games is hit or miss. Also the game is very sensitive to synchronization and ping issues. However it is still fun as all get out cause if nothing else you can play the custom maps on singleplayer or create a multiplayer game and play by yourself on it. It works flawlessly on LAN so long as both games are the same verion. Seems that most everyone plays the basic version 1.0 with no patches.
4,works for my yard...,"I purchased this unit for my yard already having blower, cultivator, edger, and string timmer from my ryobi yard runner. It is easy to handle and the real reason I like it is for the 4 cycle no mix of fuel/oil. It only takes 90-100 mls of oil and that should be changed frequently since it is small amount and easily done. I will agree it does seem underpowered and would not be good or industrial or commercial use. I have about 3000 sq ft of yard and this trimmer with the edger, cultivator, and blower attachments it is perfect for my yard. I would recommend this unit for this type of application."
3,"Works OK, but beware of attachments...","I originally bought this trimmer 2 years ago. It worked great the first several times, but shortly thereafter the shaft quit turning. The problem was that the receiver end had stripped out and left me with a rounded hole where it should have been square. Luckily i convinced my local homestore to take it back and give me another one. This second one has been working well, but the engine is getting harder to start and doesn't want to rev up to maximum RPMs; maybe the gas is old. Overall, it gets the job done, but its not a brilliant piece of engineering work."
1,Poor Performer,"I bought my Troy-Bilt 4-Cycle trimmer about 3 years ago. Was told it was a professional model. Was impressed at first but wasn't long before it began to lose power. I have to hold the trimmer and the edger just right so the blade doesn't stop spinning. I changed the spark plug, check the gap setting on rocker arms, changed the oil, nothing has helped. Now I am shopping for a new trimmer."
3,Not so good,This model does not have an easily gripped built in handle. Clumbsy to move. It tips over too easily also.
1,Horrible base,Don't bother wasting your money on this umbrella base. It won't hold an umbrella up no matter what you fill the base with. Poor engineering...
5,Book club selection,This is a great history of the American gas station in this country. I dropped out of the book club before I read all of this.
3,Academic Approach really.Ok Book.Some B&W Pics.,"Ok overall book, More of a Academic approach to the book, A Little boring at times, But Nice layout, Couple pics all B&W sadly. Need A Revised Version,This is from 1994. Overall,Can't Complain, For .01 cent I got it for(Minus The s/h charge) Good Investment."
3,A Little Over The Top,"No one can deny the great contribution Turner Ashby made to the cause of the South. However, after having said that I would recommend another book on his life simply because the author (a relative) was biased to such a point as to make this work lacking. NO ONE walks on water. Not Turner Ashby, not Lee, not Jackson, not Sherman, etc etc.There are some interesting notes (historically) on the Valley Campaign that I enjoyed.Actually, the highlight of this work was the poem of Dr. R. C. Ambler near the end of the book. It is beautiful and I think sums up Ashby better than any other place in the book."
2,waste of time and money,"This seems like it's supposed to be part one of a multi part series, but instead it's about 35 minutes forms and traditional stuff, just to learn to do an overhead slice in the super specific style. Maybe I'm just not impressed by the Japanese sword arts, sure they make some great weapons, but the way they use them is so dry compared to western martial sword arts. So maybe this guy is great, but I was looking for something different, something to practice with my friends.The first 55% of this movie is instruction on what to wear. I've got a polypropelyne bokken and I'm watching a video; I'm hardly concerned with tradition here am I?"
5,Very informative and interesting,Was not aware of this art before. Found it very interesting and highly recommend it to those that have an interest in the arts and for children that need/want to learn discipline and history.
5,Reviews from Customers,"Student Tony Boucher says, ""The study of the sword has greatly improved my life.""Student Chance Ward says, ""Very clear & precise, great explanations, history, nice touch of personal association, subtle blend of colors and anime, a dash of levity (which I love) and just the right amount of seriousness. One of the best training videos I've seen (and that's saying a lot) I've seen literally hundreds in the last 30 year!""Sensei Monica Voge: ""I've gained incredible strength in mind, body and spirit after studying with Shihan McGraugh for many years.""Student Ray Cruz: ""Shihan McGraugh is simply the best teacher I've ever worked with.""61 Years of Age Student Jack Schrader shared, ""This DVD is also invaluable as a means of continuing to train and practice at home. It is a fantastic introduction to all aspects of the Japanese katana or Samurai sword. This is a DVD that will be a permanent part of my library."""
3,Bait and switch,"Be careful when ordering this particular item. There are two different versions of this particular Monster Wii cable. Both can be seen and compared on the official Monster website: [...]The one I received can be seen here:MONSTER GAME GA WII CVA-8 Nintendo Wii Component Video and Stereo Audio Cable, 8 ft-by-MONSTER GAMESome vendors are posting the image of the newer model while shipping the older version, which presumably has slightly inferior components.The one I received works fine though. Still, I'll always wonder if the other version might have even better A/V quality."
5,JJ,"Monster brand products are always great. Monster at a big discount is a bonus. The cheap short (6') component cable I got at Best Buy was only $10. The Monster component Wii cable is a generous 10ft allowing me to hide the wiring when my HDTV was hung and allowed room to move the Wii. I can see a big difference in the quality of the Wii game as well. I never dreamed Monster would have a Wii cable. I actually ordered a no-name 9 ft cable from an Amazon vendor. They cancelled the order, so I had to look again and found the Monster for less money. A great value and good shipping by the vendor."
5,An Absolute Must Have for the Nintendo Wii,"Since the Nintendo Wii does not have HDMI, playing video games and watching Netflix via the Wii on a HDTV is not as much fun with the standard A/V cables provided by Nintendo. These Monster Component Video Cables are not HDMI, but as close as you can get to HD with the Wii. These cables are an absolute must have for any Wii fan."
1,Ridiculously Overpriced,"There's simply no reason to pay such high prices for a cable that doesn't work any better. There is no difference between the picture quality that you get from these cables compared to that of other third party component cables that can be purchased for around $15 to $20. Even Nintendo's official component cables are cheaper than these.That having been said, component cables do provide a significant improvement in appearance. Color and sharpness are improved, and it allows for progressive scan (if your television supports it). I highly recommend buying a set of component cables, especially for an EDTV or HDTV, but I do not recommend these specific cables."
4,Needed for Newer Flat Panel TVs,"Pros: Improved Picture, Improved Sound (the latter noticeable immediately)Cons: Color (my fault...I should have looked for black), Cable Length (wish there were a 3' option)Result: Happy kid (dad too)"
5,Only Monster,Is there REALLY anything else to say here... If your not using monster cable equipment already than you better crawl out from whatever rock your under ask somebody. Simply the best!
1,These reviews have to be shills,"I'm sure this cable works as well as any other wii component cable, but the others are half the price - at least. When you read the other reviews of this lead, bear in mind how much some of them sound like someone from marketing wrote them.There is no way that in any objective blinded test you could tell this apart from any other, well-reviewed eighteen dollar cable. Unless you like wasting money, buy a cheaper lead. In fact, if you do like wasting money, buy a cheaper cable anyway, then send me the difference."
5,"Wow, what a difference over ebay generic","I bought one of those cheap ebay wii component cable and got a static looking picture with what are apparently scanning lines. The monster cable is much better then generic.... worth itPros:-Heavy, well built cable. Heavy shielded from interference.-Gold tips with a shutter like ends that grasp the tv input. Tight Fit-Best picture I've ever seen from a Wii.Cons:-If you can get this cable under $20 it's worth it. Monster cables are always expensive."
3,Okay Cable,"The video quality of this cable is not much better than the composite video that comes with the WII even when I changed the WII settings to 480p resolution with this cable. I'm using a 32"" Sony Bravia 1080i LCD HD TV, and I didn't notice much (if any) difference. However, I like the construction of this cable more than the standard cables that come with the WII. Overall, I'd get the cables again, but don't expect to be wowed by the improved resolution, unless you have a large HD TV where small improvements in resolution will show.There are some reviews of this product that say you cannot run the audio cables to an amplifier. This is likely true since the cables leaving the bundle are short and can probably only reach the TV (if you're connecting the video directly to the TV like most people). However, most TVs have audio outputs that you can run to the amplifier. Another option would be to buy a female-to-female RCA coupler and have short audio cables to run to your amplifier."
4,Cheaper isn't better,"So I needed some HD cables for my Wii. And being analong outputs (not digital) I needed something shielded to get the cleanest image.At first I tried a brand that was a fraction of the price. They worked fine, but with the money I saved, it just felt wrong. I didn't know what to do with the $50, so I just rolled it around the cables likes insulation or shielding. That really hampered the flexibility of the cables and I think it caused more interference.So then I returned the cables to the store and used that money to buy these. Now my Wii looks exactly the same as if I had used the other cables, but I don't have to worry about what to do with that extra cash."
3,Good While It Lasts,"Bought these cables for better picture quality and to replace another set of Wii component/audio cables because the old ones were producing a popping sound the entire time the Wii was on. These seemed to fix the problem for a few months, then the popping came back again. Not sure if the cable is the issue or not, but when both cables were new they worked great, but after awhile we got popping noises. Other than that, the picture and sound are as expected for component cables at 480p."
2,Target $26 Cable is NOT the same cable as this one.,"I have noticed a few people saying they bought the same cable for around $26 at Target. The fact is, Target does have a 8-ft Monster Cable for $26, but that is not what Amazon is selling here. I actually bought the one at Target, and the Amazon version (also sold at Best Buy) looks to be built better and higher quality. Note: I said ""looks"".Now for performance, it didn't provide any better picture than the Rocketfish cable I bought off eBay for $7 (Best Buy retail $28). Component cable picture is a lot sharper, but it comes with its own problem - hard edges around the letters or objects. I am not sure at this point if I want to go back to stock Wii A/V cable."
4,"Where is the Lady Alma's debut CD?! C'mon, release it!","I've been hearing about Lady Alma aka Alma Horton's debut full-length CD for two years...it's been slated for release via Kindred Spirits for months...and months...and months...and now the release date has come and past, so what's the deal? Alma possesses one of the richest, searing, and most distinctive voices in ""dance"" music - if by dance you mean R&B soul, house, broken beat, downtempo, tech-house, etc. - whatever you call it, Alma certainly has it! Now c'mon, get with it and release the dang CD!"
3,The Woeful Moaning of and English Wannabe,"At first listen of this now out of print rarity, I had to question that the voice on the other end of the stero was actually Mr. Rhett Miller. In fact it is. He said in a recent interveiw that in that time of his life he was greatly influenced by David Bowie and Robyn Hitchcock (who sings on the track ""Point Shirley"" on Rhett's newest release the Instigator). Overall the song writing is wonderful, just as I would expect from Rhett and the fact that he was only 18 at the time of recording and relase makes it even more remarkable."
5,Love it!,"I am pregnant and my wedding rings are no longer fitting me. I was looking for a low-cost wedding ring replacement and this ring has been great! It's thick enough to look really good all on its own and it's a very pretty ring. But truthfully, it does look like CZs and not diamonds (but I think CZs are always pretty obvious in comparison to diamonds' ""fire"".) That said, I am beyond pleased with the level of quality for the price of this ring though. I'd highly recommend it."
5,Love it!,"I ordered this ring as my wedding band and engagement rings got too tight during pregnany and I am old fashioned enough to not want a naked finger. The order was shipped sooner than they indicated and I was plesantly surprised by the ring. I've received tons of compliments when I wear this. It's a great back up ring for travling when you don't want to go with your expensive wedding set. This is a great ring, especially for the price."
3,Pretty but.......,"I loved this ring when I first saw it. I should have listened when i read other reviews. The gaps between the stones are large and noticeable. The ring size is not true; I wear a size 7 so that was what I ordered when i should have gone up to a size 8. If you have small hands this is not the ring for you, trust me. Get yourself a band that is 2 or 3mm no biggger. I have already started looking for a better fitting wedding band. As my title stated this is a pretty ring but it does have it's flaws."
2,Didn't Like,"The fit was great, the service was great, but it didn't sparkle, was very dull. I kept it, but I should have returned it."
3,Stopped wearing it,"I bought this as my wedding ring. While at first it was beautiful, after wearing it for a month or so, the actual ring was no longer straight around. It had actually bent slightly. So when placing it on a table, it didn't lay flat. Which is weird because I just type all day. Plus, it was hard to see any sparkle in the ""stones"" because of the backing on them. I'm going to purchase another ring for a replacement."
3,Eternity Band,"This ring is very beautiful and I have received compliments about it. However, it does look different than it appears on the site. Only the person who wears it often will begin to recognize some things about. The first interesting thing is that the band is quite thick. This is neither a positive or a negative, just interesting. The second thing I noticed is that there are little gaps between the stones. For the price I paid, I cannot complain, but I do sometimes rotate my ring so that the section with the least gaps is on top. The best thing is that it has not tarnished."
5,This is it!!!!,This ring is gorgeous! It is an unbelievable bargain! As good as this ring looks it can't be beat. I LOVE IT! It is extremely comfortable and the shine is non stop. It is a substantial piece of jewelery that won't get out of shape over time. This sizing was dead on and it arrived much earlier than expected.
4,Very pretty.,"Much better than I had expected. I don't wear it continuously, but it's very shiny and sparkly. It's nice alone or with other rings."
1,NOT SO NICE,I ORDER THIS RING READING ALL THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE LEFT SAYING THIS RING WAS SO NICE THE DIAMONDS LOOK REAL WHEN I GOT THIS RING I WAS MAD THE DIAMONDS LOOK PLASTIC AND YOU CAN TELL THE RING WASNT REAL I KNO THE DIAMONDS ARENT REAL BUT IT STILL COULD OF LOOK AT LOT BETTER THAN WHAT IT DID.I GUESS U HAVE TO JUDGE FOR URSELF AND DONT LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO JEWERLY
5,Great Ring and Service,The ring is beautiful. Very sparkly and looks real. I wear it at work and it definitely is durable.
5,Which is real???,This ring is beautiful. The color is perfect. It is pictured beautiful and comes looking just like it if not better. Will buy again even for a friend.
5,A must buy...,"I recently went to a ballet in berkeley, california and enjoyed listening to this music during a performance. To say the least, i enjoyed it tremendously. I believe it still has a freshness about it that can be enjoyed in the new millenium. I especially enjoyed ""Arepolska"". A beautifully romantic song. So if your tired of listening to all that junk on the radio today, turn your ear towards Hoven Droven. I think you will enjoy it as much as i have."
3,Very Cool,"I happened to catch a few minutes of a performance by these guys on TV, and thought they were really rocking on the edge (flaming violin!). Clearly an unusual mix... celtic folk meets metal?? Overall very interesting and enjoyable. There are a moments related to song arrangements that feel a bit cliche' or formula driven (hence 3 stars), but there are some real strong songs too. It is unique album, highly recommended for getting a taste of this band, and getting something unusual into your collection."
2,Not the original versions...,If you're looking for Pravo's original recordings for some of the titles don't buy this CD. The recordings are all from the 80s and I can't say that they do the artist any credit. I feel that I wasted my money.
1,I agree with the 1-star reviewers,"Read their reviews. I skipped ahead and wanted to learn ""Chapter 6: Managing Outside Communication"", and I found details left out in the two examples that I looked at but now I'm skeptical about the rest of the book. I bought this book hoping to learn some advanced features but in the end, I'm returning it. Not surprisingly, I see a lot of other people selling their edition which tells you that something's wrong."
3,More worship at the alter of Sabbath,"Well as most of the other reviewers have pointed out,this is to be filed along side the other Sabbath-obsessed bands out there.So,do we really need another Sabbath rehash? When its done this good,then the answer is,well, YEAH! Also as a previous reviewer mentioned,this is indeed ""Sabbath played with a Black Metal attitude"",and it proves here to be two great tastes that taste great together (at least to these two half-deaf ears).3 stars due to the oversaturation of bands in this sub-genre - add one more if the Stoner/Doom scene is yer ""thing""...."
4,sahg one,"Pretty good heavy rock album....wasn't familiar with this band until I heard 'em on Pandora internet radio....for enthusiasts of ""doom"" and other heavy rock bands [especially Black Sabbath]....stand out track ""Soul Exile"".....my only complaint is the rather low quality,""muddy"" production job which detracts from the obvious musical talents these guys have...reminds me of Magus...."
5,Still going strong,"I have had my La Pavoni expresso maker for 35 years of coffee making. A couple of years ago we replaced the switch, and that is the only problem I have had. Although, it doesn""t come with alot of bells and whistles, (nothing to go wrong) it makes great coffee. The style has stayed the same in the Europiccola, for at least as long as I have owned mine. It is easy to use and put's on quite a ""show"" for guests, with it's steaming and sputtering. You will love it."
4,"Great design, well engineered.","We had a Briel pump driven machine before the pavoni, which lasted not even 2 years and cost a bit over 100.After that we thought it would be worth paying extra for a Pavoni, and bought one on ebay for 130.As other reviewers on here have said, you need to be a bit committed and persistant to learn to get the espresso right, but it does the job very well and the design and solid feel is fantastic.What I really like in our throw away society is the availability of spare parts. You can replace everything - we did a seal replacement no problem, and replacing the element is easy too apparently. Much better throwing three or four sets of seals over 10 yrs rather than five rubbishy machines into landfill sites."
5,Bravissimo!,"This is a Ferrari of espresso machines. In addition to being a work of art (it's at MOMA in the permanent collection), La Povoni makes great espresso, period."
1,Don't Do It!,"I was so excited when I received this, and so disappointed when I actually used it. Every time I bake cookies I start out all optimistic, maybe it will work this time...NOPE! Everything sticks, awkward to try to put in the dishwasher without taking up half the top rack, permanently sticky from non-stick spray, and smells horribly toxic in the oven.I'd take a rusty old metal pan over this thing anyday."
5,If your kid likes dinosaurs this is ideal.,My son went through a big dinosaur phase in the last year and I have purchased more and more of these figures. This bucket is a good value. It's a durable container and there are lots of types of dinosaurs inside.
1,Disappointing,"The movie just didnt have that Jackie Chan feel to it. His fight scenes were strained and didnt look natural. The version I bought was not widescreen so i missed a lot of details, plus the seller gave me a horrible copy and the movie froze with 5 minutes left. I dont even know how it ends! But, its not too disappointing since the movie wasnt that great anyway."
1,Ouch,"Chan spends a long time getting his own rear end handed to him before getting shot like a little punk. Souds like a good flick, eh?"
2,New Fist Of Fury,"JACKIE DIES AT THE END!!!... In this film JACKIE WILL REMIND YOU OF BRUCE LEE!!!... This film is supposed to be the sequel to Bruce Lee's ""Fist Of Fury"". Jackie plays the brother of Bruce's character from the original film. Jackie doesn't enjoy fighting and has no interest in martial arts until a Japanese school begins to terrorize the local Chinese kung fu school. The Jackie starts to train so he can defeat the Japenese. THIS FILM IS SO BAD THAT AT THE END THIS OLD MAN FIGHTS FOR A SECOND AND DIES STANDING UP!!!... WHAT A WASTE!!!..."
2,Why it wasnt very good,"As the reviewers below me have said, jackie is supposed to play bruce lee's brother in this movie. After Bruce Lee died director Lo Wei tried to turn Jackie into bruces replancement, hence why they made a sequel to the classic Fist of Fury (the chinese connection) I have read Jackies autobiography I AM JACKIE CHAN: MY LIFE IN ACTION and he stresses how much he hated being called ""the next bruce lee"". He didnt want to play a serious and fearless character like bruce lee's was. On the bright side this film allowed for him to become what he is today. In my opinion if you want to see a Bruce Lee style kung fu movie (aka a fearless hero who is an undefeated fighter), see the orignal Fist of Fury (called The Chinese Connection in america) and if you want to see a Jackie Chan kung fu/comedy movie (his characters are usually trouble makers that dont want to fight) i would recommend both the drunken master movies and snake in eagles shadow."
3,A Fab Story,"Although I have visited this house which is now a Bed & Breakfast and have met Louise Harrison a few times at Beatlefest in Chicago where she told the Story of her Brothers visit to Benton , I was glad somebody wrote a book on this subject but also dissapointed by the fact that nobody had pictures of Georges visit even though his Brother Peter was with him at the time taking pictures why didnt the Author try to contact Peter during this book and yet Peter is not mentioned a lot in this book where was he all this time George was hanging out with the Four Vest !!! I think more research could've been done but still a good book to pick up and read !!!"
4,great little grinder,"I did a lot of research before purchasing a grinder and I'm glad I took the time to narrow it down to this one. It has done a great job at a consistant grind, with minimal noise, and tons of grind settings. Quality."
2,This grinder has problems,I purchased the La Pavoni Burr Grinder summer 2005. After some 7 months of grinding once a day for one serving - it stopped working. In addition to its short life span it frequently would grind coffee beans and wouldn't stop grinding until I pulled the cord from the wall. This resulted in an overflow from the ground bean container. The setting to control the type of grind stopped working several months ago resulting in finely ground beans all the time.I will never buy this brand again.
2,not the quality I thought,"Too messy!! same grind despite what setting it is on-decided not to use after all. This is the second ""inexpensive"" burr grinder we purchaced and I guess one has to pay much more for a decent grinder."
2,"Meh. It makes no difference in my coffee's taste, hard to clean","Well, it sure looks nice. It's not too loud. But there are some problems with this grinder. First off, it's hard to clean the inside. I previously owend a simple Braun blade grinder that was EASY to clean. Secondly, the grounds sometimes stick to the inside of the plastic hopper, which was never a problem with my old Braun. It causes a mess sometimes. But the main prblem is that I notice no difference whatsoever in the taste of my coffee versus using the old blade grinder. We use Intelligensia coffee, Chicago's best (and winner of some international awards). And frankly, I noticed no difference in taste when I tried out another burr grinder from a different brand. (I consider myself a foodie, and am quite particular and hard to impress)."
3,Burr grinder is a mess,the grinder does a pretty good job of grinding the bean. The grind is consistent from time to time and I am satisfied with that feature. The biggest problem is the mess that is generated from grinding. Maybe you should expect a mess when you grind coffee I don't know. I will try another brand when this one wears out.
3,"Good grinder, short life, and messy","It took a little while to find the right setting and always produced quite a bit of supper fine grindings. It also got hung up on beans every now and then, but otherwise worked quite well if you open it over the sink and consider that it was only $25. My biggest problem was that it only lasted about 6 months. It gets hung up and only has an on switch, so you have to unplug it as soon as it gets hung up or it will burn out in less than 6 months."
2,You'd Better Love Coffeee,"OK so this does grind beans, but the port for the ground coffee allows the grounds to leak out the sides and bottom of the clear plastic chamber. This seems like no big, but it does mean you will be wiping up coffee dust every time! Coffee everywhere! All they had to do is make the port extend further into the chamber. As is, it will grind beans (forget the 19 settings, you will always want it at 19). And the coffee will taste fine, but know that you will have cleanup after each pot. Static is a problem too. I still recommend this over the old propeller grinders."
3,get what you pay for?,"I bought this burr grinder as an upgrade for a blade grinder and being the cheap b@st@rd that I am, bought the most highly rated, cheap grinder on Amazon. I would not buy this grinder again on the basis that it sprays coffee grounds all around it as it grinds (I now put it in the sink when I am grinding). Also, I am no expert on coffee grinding, but on the most course setting, there are a lot of fine grounds mixed in which turns into sludge at the bottom of my french pressed coffee cup-- maybe this would be better with a more expensive grinder. however, it still seems to work better than my blade grinder, and I am too lazy and cheap to upgrade, so I am keeping it."
4,Recommended!,"This is a great little grinder. Yes, there's a little spillage around the sides, but it's a small price to pay. The flavor difference going to this from a blade grinder is like night and day!"
1,Disappointing,I was looking forward to this DVD but the first one I got was so badly scratched that there was no way you could watch it. It had to be used. Amazon sent me another one but it is not much better so I still have not seen the whole DVD. Amazon shame on you.
5,"Great power, small space, quiet","I bought this for my woodworking shop. It has more than enough capacity for my present needs (brad nailers, primarily), but should be adequate if I get into spray finishes. I also like the fact that it is quiet!"
2,Principal Texes,The book is too general. Doesnt give you any hints or facts. I found very useful other materials. The author is very kind but not important information will be found in this text.
3,Lots of info.,"I read through parts of this book. There is lots of valuable info...but in my opinion, there is almost TOO much info to go through. My advice is to take your TExES principal exam with Highland Park as your ideal school and go from there. Remember, if possible, to start a committee for everything and always involve as many people as possible in the decision making and you will pass."
4,Great radio drama,"Orson Welles got some incredible performances out of Ray Collins in the Mercury Theatre on the Air series (here as the Russian captain)...you can't even tell it's him! Also, I didn't realize that Bernard Herrmann composed original music for Orson Welles's radio dramas before Citizen Kane. Very cool."
3,"Er, Tin maybe...certainly not Chrome.","OK, credit where it's due - the graphics are nice and the gameplay seems to be inline with most other FPS's. It's reasonably well thought out (although a little corny) and the vehicles are cool. So why the three stars? Well, if you wanna play a fast paced game with plenty of action this ain't it, this game just seems to drag on and on. Get use to sitting and watching video. I got tired of being interrupted during gameplay just to watch another video to explain to me what I obviously needed to do next. If you enjoy that sorta thing then this might be a nice addition to your collection, if on the otherhand you just wanna jump in and start kicking butt, try Unreal Tournament 2003."
5,BEST SCI-FI ACTION SHOOTER of 2003? YES!,"Wow. Wow. Wow. What a nice surprise. SOOOOO Much better than Deus Ex 2--Invisible War. Terrific Action. Enormous outdoor environments that are incredibly well-designed and realistic. Driveable vehicles. DX-like cybernetic modifications. This is the game Deus Ex 2 SHOULD have been. Great strategy component, too, as you can only carry a realistic inventory and you're often outgunned in firefights unless you use a bit of strategy. The only flaw is the facial modeling of the characters is a bit weak, but the lip-synch is actually darn good, as is the acting and the story. Buy this instead of DX2! You'll be GLAD you did."
4,demo GOOD FUN,"haven't bought game, im cautious about adding more disks to my collection, but playing demo for two days now and its like Halo but with other people online. the weapons are much more accurate and the graphics aren't as ""blobby"" as Halos'. good deal i guess"
4,"For any Jean Berger fans, yes","I was reminded that I had bought this CD through Amazon when doing some research on Jean Berger, and brought it out of the cabinet for another listen.Having appreciated Jean Berger's music for the church, this is a good addition to any collection. Singing is clean, clear. The men's section, which IMO is the driving force in Berger's music, does a wonderful job.Hans Gal was new to me, but also worth it!Berger though was the main reason for buying this CD and no disappointment at all. Just a wonderful example of what he did with the human voice to bring out the best in a text. The performance is well done, NOT, IMO, an easy composer to sing by any means."
4,Good Ballardian novel,"I'm not sure I'd put this book in the top 10 of the last 20 years. But it is definitely a quick taut intriguing read in a style similar to, but more accessible than, J.G. Ballard. It's not as absolutely raw and shocking as Ballard either but there's still plenty of dark raw degradation to enjoy.I may not share the other reviewer's absolute rapture with this book, but there's no doubt that it is a serious and well-written novel in the Ballardian vein."
4,Telarc sound extravaganza,"Here's a great deal on a 2 disc set from Telarc.If you like live jazz, this set features great standards and terrific artistsin live performances from 1990-1998. The sound quality isamazing, as Telarc has been highly regarded asan audiophile label for nearly twenty years. Buy this, dimthe lights, and be transported to the clubs where theseperformances took place."
4,You'll probably need two of these...,"I ordered one of these, thinking it would be a set of two, since the picture shows two and every other picture shows two pipes. My mistake. Once I got the second one, and installed them. Which by the way they are a pain in the neck to install. And if your pipes are already installed, even worse. You have to take your pipes back off, take the heats shields off, then pull the stock baffles out, and push these in. Its really not that fun of a job, but realistically didn't take me that long to do. Three hours later, took the pipes off, had the quiet baffles in and put the pipes back on. Once in, they do exactly what I needed them to do. Tone down the rasp on the idle end of the RPM range. My neighbors weren't to fond of the crazy loud idle. Anyway... My two cents."
1,useless,Baffles make such a little dif in the sound they are a waste of money. See my review on short shots.
4,"Quiter sound, easy to install","I was a little hesitant to buy these baffles because so many of the reviews said they don't lower the noise that much and they were difficult to install. That may be the case with other pipes, but I have the V&H; Sideshots. Installation was as simple as removing the heat shields, loosening the set screw and removing the original baffles, then reverse for installation. Took about 45 minutes at most.The ""quiet"" baffles don't quiet it down to stock quiet, but do reduce the sound from a higher pingy metallic exhaust note to a much lower one. I still wear earplugs most of the time, but its a much more pleasant sound."
4,Well Writen,This a well writen book on ADs and it does show to you the important and salient points about ADs. In contrast to a number of books that I have read on ADs this one is definitely worth having it on your shelf
1,"Bought this one too, unimpressed",Left scratching my head on many of the chapters. Also the topics covered were written in a manner that was too advanced and failed to relate back to previous versions of Windows server O/S for clarification. W2K has many new concepts and this book seems to be written for thise that beta tested the product.
3,Orpheus Descending,"This was a very difficult show to watch. I got it because a group was studying Tennessee Williams. It portrays a very depressing side of life. I gave it three stars because I thought it was well written, but I wouldn't recommend it as good theater."
2,Disguised LDS version of ancient American history,"This is a frankly fascinating book. It was published by the Farnsworth family and no where in its pages mentions the LDS (Mormon)church. Yet the spin this tome places on primitive American peoples (all one, belief in one God, appearing out of ""nowhere"" about 600 B.C., belief in resurrection, etc.) in an ostensibly academic way would lead the casual reader (for whom this is intended) to believe that this is mainstream thinking. It is not.I gave it two stars because in spite of its stealth bias, it's got great old pictures of primitive American sites."
2,Meh,"While there may be an interesting story buried beneath the frenetic prose and flip-flopping between past and present, I wasn't willing to find it. I did however, like the concept."
5,Excelent. Truly Excelent.,I can not begin to express how much I enjoyed this novel. This has to be the most original spin on the Vampyre genere in decades. Well done Richard.
2,Boring,"Another book I would never have read, were it not required for class. The story itself was boring, but the most bothersome part of the novel is that the author never stuck to a single narrator.Normally, that would not annoy me; however, in this instance, she would utilize more than one person on the page, without any forewarning. This often threw me out of the story, which I already found lacking."
5,This is an easy to read and well-written travel book.,"Come Travel With Me To The Other Side Of Sunset is a collection of stories of the travels that Mr. Ladewig has made to many parts of the world. It is easy to read and made me feel that I was traveling with him. In-depth interest is added by the author's active participation and enjoyment in good food, hiking, horseback riding, sailing, scenery, and photography. The book contains many excellent photographs. It also provides many helpful tips and suggestions on how to plan the various aspects of a trip. While this book covers travels to many parts of the world, favorite locations appear to be the out-of-the-way Caribbean Islands and the Canadian Rockies. This book entices me to travel to some places where I have never been, to go back to some where I have been and to dream about the rest. A very enjoyable well written and entertaining book"
1,Poor Design,I had my Troy Bilt less than six months before problems started and it only got occasionally use since I bought it in September. The inside of the top shaft that connects all the gadgets simply wore out so none of the attachments made the proper connection. I had the shaft replaced for $75.00. I asked the shop how long it was guaranteed for and they said the manufacturer only guaranteed it for 30 days - so that tells you something right there.Save you self some money and hassle and skip this product.
4,Pretty decent so far; lacks a shoulder strap,"I've had this trimmer for a couple of weeks now, and it's my first trimmer, although I've used an electric one in the past.I like the simplicity of the 4-cycle engine, since there is no mucking with oil/gas mixes. Use the primer, pull once or twice, the engine starts and you're good to go. The trimmer has been very efficient on cutting tall grass and weeds (this is not for a lawn, it's for a wild growth area on my lot). I haven't tried detailed work such as edge trimming on a lawn. So far, the only drawback is the weight. After 15mn of operation, between the weight of the trimmer, the vibrations, and pulling the trigger, my right hand goes numb and I have to stop. I wish the trimmer had some kind of shoulder support. But then 15mn gets a lot done, cutting a path through this jungle in progress. I imagine that if you have stronger arms and hands than me (shouldn't be too hard), you won't have this problem.Don't forget your safety glasses !"
1,We have been robbed by Troy-Bilt,"My trimmer broke the first time I used it. We took it to an authorized dealer and it is still there (May - November - gardening season). The dealer - Lebanon Lawn Center, in Lebanon, TN, remarked ""That's what you get for buying online."" He claims that Troy-Bilt will not accept the Amazon receipt for repair. I am worried that we will never see it again. We sent them the money and we have no trimmer. We also puchased the edger and the tiller attachment that haven't seen the light of day. Too bad we can't rate zero stars. Way too much hassle!"
4,4 cycle is superior,"I purchased this Trimmer several weeks ago so have not run it very much. Amazon's price was about $35 less than Lowe's (including tax). This replaces a Ryobi 725r which I used for over 10 years but it is getting a skosh low on power and I wanted to try a 4 cycle. I was impressed with: The ease of starting, the low noise, lack of smoke, lack of smell, the power and the torque. It is a little heavy but the strap takes care of that and the balance is good."
4,A real meat-eater,"This is a great trimmer. I've used gas powered trimmers many years ago but thought that I could get by with a battery-powered trimmer at my new home. After one summer the battery kept loosing it's charge quickly and an new battery was a pain to find. I got this trimmer and it was so easy without the oil and gas mixing and a very easy start. I'm 6' 1"" so it was nice that I didn't have to bend as much as I did with the electric trimmer either. It shipped quickly and I was up and running with it in a matter of 20 minutes. The only draw back would be the lack of a shoulder strap (although I think its even lighter than my battery powered trimmer)."
1,find a better trimmer...,"Ergonomically, the trimmer is OK. It's kinda heavy, but that's to be expected with a 4-cycle engine. The severe vibration limits my trimming sessions to only 5-10 min tops. The biggest problem, however, has only revealed itself after a season (maybe 10 hours) of use: the engine is smoking and stalling out after a few minutes running. After ensuring it had oil and fresh gas (4-cycle, so no gas/oil mix) and the problem still occurred, I went online to find a service center. None within 50 miles of my zip code. The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all. I've looked into other repair facilities, but I can't identify who actually manufactures the engine, so nobody will take it apart. I'm either left to fiddle with it myself, or to get another trimmer."
5,Great trimmer,"I have this for 3 years, I only use it occationally. It is very very easy to start, 1 to 2 pulls to start. It is even easier than to ECHO hetch trimmer which is supposed to be professional grade. It dosen't smell as bad compare to the ECHO 2 cycle hetch trimmer I have. I have no problem with it at all."
1,Disappointing,"This book may be illuminating for those teachers, parents and tutors who do not believe that such a thing as work inhibition exists (calling it ""laziness"" instead), but I don't really believe such people exist anymore.The experienced educator or perplexed parent reading this book in hopes of learning something new about work inhibition and how to treat it will be disappointed. Points that most of us accept as obvious (e.g. that work inhibition is orthogonal to ""intelligence"") are lengthily supported by dubious surveys and statistics. More problematic points (e.g. that potentially WI students can be identified early on by overly ""clingy"" behavior) are stated as postulates.Some practical approaches are suggested for dealing with WI. They are all obvious.A guidance counselor or teacher trying to bring a punishment-oriented (as opposed to treatment- and education-oriented) principal into the 20th century may find that this book will help to legitimize her or his concern"
1,Apron Had a Rust Stain,"I purchased this apron as a gift that I planned on getting embroidered. Unfortunately, when I brought it to the Embroidery shop I discovered a rust stain from the buckle and it had a yellowish tint to it. Not good."
1,Wasn't what I ordered...,"I just received the package, it was supposed to be a DII Chef's Apon with an adjustable neck strap instead I received 4 small black aprons without the adjustable strap and on top of it, the size is way too small!I am rating it one star because there is no option fo zero stars..."
1,French press thermos,This product is not what you would hope for. It is made out of the type of plastic that chips. The glass and metal products often seen are much better. The capacity of the thermos is much too small and the price is too high for the quality of the product.I compared it to the Nissian product (stainless steel) and it was not in the same league.
3,Great story! Not the best writing.,"Dave Duncan's characters are real and memorable. He introduces some originality into this popular genre which grabs hold and wont let go. But his attempts at mystery are a little lacking. And the ways in which his characters leap to sudden conclusions or receive profound insight is frequently unclear, causing the reader to stumble through the next several pages in confusion, wondering what they missed, until events fall into place. I found it distracting and off-putting and though I liked the story, I'm not sure if I want to read the finale. I can probably guess how it'll end anyway.'"
5,Wonderful Series,"The Seventh Sword is a great series. I couldn't put the books down. Wally Smith dies on earth and wakes to find himself in the body of a master swordsman, living another man's life in another world. Suffice it to say, his 20th century values don't quite match those of the man's body he is inhabiting, which makes for some interesting turns as he runs into people who recognize him..."
2,Lifeless--where's the passion?,"An unexciting, uninvolving autobiography. Where's the ""passion""? The history is interesting to a point, but the nitty-gritty seems to be lacking. Given Caldicott's powerful speech making and her powerful writing in If You Love This Planet, this desiccated book is a big disappointment. People and events simply don't come alive here."
4,Lots of Room,When this came in it was a perfect size. Lots of room for everything. My friend I bought it for had a knife set of 16 Wusthof's and it fit in this perfectly.
4,Strap NOT included,"The knife bag was just as beautiful as pictured and the design and pockets are wonderful. However, it did NOT come with a strap, as pictured."
2,Early English Translation?,"I love the book and own a hard copy, but why did this translator translate the book into early English??? You can't argue with the price, but no one should really pay a cent for this translation when there are so many better alternatives!"
1,The Baconian Heresy.,"Walter Conrad Arensberg was an important poet in the development of literary cubism. He and Gertrude Stein developed this idiom before classic French modernist Reverdy. This movement was determinative in the development of modern verse. Later representatives include Laura Riding (Jackson), Yvor Winters' early poems, Kenneth Rexroth, and the Objectivists but it's influence certainly is not limited to them. In later life Arensberg devoted his fortune to proving the Baconian Heresy the idea that Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare's works. This is silly and a complete waste of time. Why then is Arensberg's writings on Francis Bacon in print and not his poems. Damned if I know."
1,....ZZZZ....OOH IM AWAKE NOW..!,Watching This Film With Girlfriend Was So Ho-Hum....She Decided To Become A Ho-Hummer....I Was More Than Happy To Click The DVD Off..!
4,Good stretching & mild workout,"This video is well produced. The instructor & music are very soothing. It makes you feel as if you are not really exercising, although the routine does work up a sweat. It is mostly stretching with some gentle movement. She takes you through it step by step. I was fine until she stood on her head! Even the ""easy"" alternative involves standing on your head. You also need a long exercise band. I think an 8 foot long one would be good."
2,not the Tupler Technique,"this Video is not the mummy tummy workout designd for diastasis recti, I ordered it because I thought it was the DVD that goes with the book lose your Mummy Tummy and it does not so if you are ordering this for treatment of Diastasis Recti it is the wrong exercises. but uses the same name as the tupler technique. i was disapointed that it had the same name as the Book. felt it a little misleading. thats all"
4,good tunes,"well, if you're a follower of the genre this is the magazine for you. each issue has at least 1 interesting, well researched article on a band you've heard of. the album reviews tend to be a bit bland - hard to get candid criticism here. but the ads and listings for events are top notch, and the letters and questions sections are full of interesting historical tidbits."
2,Last month's magazine.,"They do like every magazine distributor and send you last month's issue for the first delivery. Sadly, many of the events promoted have already occurred. Everything else was fine."
5,"Great Gift, Being Delivered Regularly",Got this as b-day gift for father-in-law. He loves it! and it is delivered as promised.
4,new title,"this book is renamed ""a matter of magic"" and still consists of mairelon the magician and the magician's wardA Matter of Magic"
3,Find your problem easy.,"By having specific exercises from experts, I felt I would be doing the ""right"" exercise for my specific problem. It worked for me very well. Much better than taking medication."
3,So-So Book...,After a winter long RA flareup that crippled my hands I hoped that this book would supply me with exercises that might get back some of what I lost in terms of flexibility and strength. Alas most of the exercises it shows can be found for free on the Internet.
4,Basic Exercises,"The exercises in this book are very basic stretching and flexibility exercises. They work well for me when I am having flare ups of my joints. Normally I exercise more aggressively. There are many varied exercises in this book, exercises cover every motion of every joint. Would recommend."
4,Young Buck,"Very pleased to obtain this CD of Buck's Pep recordings which, I gather, is now deleted. My main interest was the original ""Hot Dog"" - the Capitol version which I have on the Rhino box set, while aurally superior, lacks the original's bite. I rate this 4 out of 5 - great material, liner notes reasonably informative, the only negative being the audio quality of some tracks which might result from disc dubbing rather than master recordings - the notes do not explain. Finally, neat to see that the late Buck, God bless him, donated his royalties from this project to the Country Music Hall Of Fame - what a legend!"
2,Hard to do cryptos,"This book is OK except that the cryptograms puzzles are printed so close together that I found it close to impossible to solve them by trying to print teeny, tiny letters above the puzzle. Anybody who does these puzzles knows what I mean. Most books with puzzles like this use capital letters that are evenly spaced so you can print in pencil above each word. What were these folks thinking? The other puzzles in the book work OK, but I feel gyped."
1,Some old same old,"If you want to hear a lot of whining from a grown woman, this is the book for you. If you are looking for thoughtful literature, don't buy this piece of trash. Can I have my money back?"
3,Courageous Rolando not on top,"Rolando Villazon poures his heart into every role he sings but sometimes it's just a little bit too much. He is 100% all the time from start to end and this makes the climaxes in the drama and music vanish. I would wish he could economize with his dramatic gestures and acting, and then let go in the big scenes. Gounod's score has enough drama and high voltage music already.The same with his singing. I think his 100% attitude has damaged him vocally. He sounds strained in this production, he omits some top notes in the third and fifth act and sometimes hides behind Machaidzes voice in the duets. Occasionally he shouts more than he sings. Machaidze has a very large secure voice and looks a bit like Netrebko, but without her charisma and charm."
4,"Good, but not excellent","When I buy opera on DVD, it's because I want to watch as well as hear. Unfortunately, of late most stagings are disappointing at best, offensive at worst. This one had a bit of both. And i'm getting tired of the new fad that dictates there must be action during the overture! The singing, however, being the most important, did not entirely disappoint. Sure, Villazon sounds a bit strained, but still. Machaidze I found a little shrill, her sound cold. Perhaps I'm unfairly comparing her to Mexican soprano Maria Alejandres, who I had the pleasure to hear on stage in the same role shortly before buying this DVD, and who I consider ideal for the role of Juliette. But all in all, I am pleased with it. Sound is wonderful and well balanced."
2,A Waste of Money,"I bought this from Amazon back in 2001 and it's been sitting in the garage since 2002. While it looks nice, all it's useful for is allowing water to stagnate in a pool at the base. It has a small, difficult-to-clean drawer one is supposed to use for oldcoffee grounds, but it is too small for this. Save your money and keep your machine on the counter, where it can be easily used and properly cleaned and refilled with water."
2,Would not buy again,"This product can use a bit more cushioning, the quality is not the best. I think it can break easy with a heavy duty job."
2,Weak - Not recommended,"I tried cutting a simple coat hanger wire with this Stanley plier and could barely do it. It was work, real work. Other brand pliers cut through that wire all day long - no problem.The weight of the plier feels right. The handle grip material is not smooth, rather, it's textured; kind of a hard foam. Didn't feel comfortable to me. Overall, a rather weak offering from Stanley, who, once upon a time, made a nice set of tools. If you make a living with your tools, this one is definitely not for you. Even if you are a weekend DIY'er, I still can't recommend them.Ps. I also tried the regular slip joint pliers they make (same product line) and found them difficult to use -- they stuck rather than glided smoothly."
5,Another customer,"I have found the original five cd's released by Mystical Music Experience (Karmic Energies, Life Cycles, The Prophet, Harmony of Sense, Stations of the Tarot) to be energizing, relaxing, calming, yet invigorating. Each of these cd's has it's own unique ""personality"" and are definite assets to have the series. I have owned these for 10 years plus and would enjoy further works from this group of New Age Artists."
2,keep looking,"I bought this stroller for my 14 month old twins for a trip to Disney. I wanted something light and portable for the trains, trams, and buses - this is not it. It's very heavy and bulky. It's not easy to carry. The canopy has to come off for folding. And the worst part, it doesn't keep my twins in. Even on the smallest settings, they come out of the straps and stand up. I can't even use it now."
2,Chicco Stroller,"Chicco is usually a good brand. However, I found this type of stroller too stiff to use. The seats do not move forward enough, upright. The highest level leaves the children at an incline of about 120 degrees to 140 degrees back. When awake, my children prefer sitting upright about 90 to 100 degrees, angle. The overhead covers kept on coming off the rims. The clips did not hold well."
5,Delightful,This updated version of the original Nora the Piano Cat DVD contains all of her latest videos. It is so much fun to see her with complete clarity on a big screen with good sound quality. It will make you smile!
5,Great pocket travel guide,"This small travel guide/map of Berlin is very useful. The foldable map is very easy to use. The book also features a map of the Berlin subway system (including the U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines and stations). This information came in very handy. A word of caution: the admission fees for most tourist attractions are wrong in the book, so plan on spending at least twice what the book says. Overall, a highly recommended book!"
3,"it's ok, better the more powerful one","it's ok, it works and keep promises. Has some weakness in the power, so I'd suggest the more powerful one. Pay attention: as per now accessories are not compatible with the 2 different models."
1,"It wa very andy anduseful, before it suddenly died while mixing a milkshake!","This is the second of this product we have already bought from amazon, the first is still good (my mother in law has it), But this second one just died after very light work. The hardest job it ever did was whipping some eggs. I am very dissapointed with it, now we are in the process of claiming the warranty. let se how the customer support works..."
5,Great for mixing baby formula!!!,"I have baby twins and make up A LOT of formula - this made the job so easy that my husband even does it now!!I had thought it would make it too bubbly, but not at all:)"
4,great little tool,"This takes the mess out of many tasks like blending soups and gravies. The Multiquick is powerful enough to go get a smooth puree out of almost anything. Mine did not come with the whisk, but it use the regular attachment for almost anything. Careful with uncooked, easily oxidizing vegetables like avocado: the heat generated by the front-blade can turn your veggie puree color, so chill your bowl and reduce the rpms and exposure time"
4,"very good for small jobs, but not durable","In last 3 years I owned two MR430HC/AC-s. The first one lasted more then a year, being used 2-3 times a week. It was the only ""blender/food processor"" in my kitchen. It chopped herbs and nuts, and once even some meat, blended soups and smoothies, whisking eggs, and even mixing flour with butter for pastry. Then I guess I gave it too hard a job to do (the flour and butter for pastry that was) and the motor failed. I loved the applience so much I immediately got another one, promising myself not to ask too much of such a little guy. Another year passed, I always remembered not to use it for too hard jobs, but the motor failed again. I am not getting a third one.I think I need something bigger. This guy is just too small to be the only applience of this kind in my kitchen."
3,Good but not lasting,"To date I have bought 3, I have ordered another, however of a different brand, hoping that I can get longer service.The mixer is great if only it would last longer!"
2,too powerful,"I purchased this blender to replace an older model with less power. I mostly use these blenders for soup. This model is so powerful that all it wants to do is suction itself to the bottom of the pot, and when I haul it up to puree the rest of the ingredients it sprays hot soup all over the kitchen. If you buy it, use it in the deepest pot you have."
5,Multi-purpose long lasting tyke,"I've had this blender for 3 years now and I've never had a single issue with it. The whisk is perfect for cakes and eggs. The chopper attachment is great for my indian gravies and I even use it as a spice grinder for dry spices. Unlike blenders that won't grind masalas without water, this deceptively tiny device is way more powerful than any blender I've had.You just have to be careful to use a deep bowl, or have everything splash over the counters and remember not to use spices like turmeric - they tend to stain the plastic of the chopper. The variable speed one may be good for people with weaker wrists - the thumb does get a workout with this one."
5,I couldn't live without it!,"I love this gadget. My mother and sister in law both had one and I thought it was silly. Until I saw it chop garlic from whole peeled cloves. And mix a homemade salad dressing in two seconds flat. And make foamed milk for lattes. And chop nuts for cookies.And the clean up is AMAZING. I really love this thing!I mounted mine on the inside of my baking cabinet and I can now pump out cookies super fast. I highly recommend this wonderful, durable piece of sensible technology!"
1,Braun Useless Company,I bought this item last year and must have used couple of times when the motor died. I called the Braun service center and they asked me to go to one of there service station in the area..I went there and found that they only fix Braun shavers and no other Braun items..so I called Braun service center again and they asked me to ship the item to there centralized service center...hmm..so people really have time in this age and era to go to this extent to get one stupid appliance fixed...not worth buying...
2,Broke in less than one month,"I was only able to use it three times. In the begining, the unit worked great. I liked the fact that it was a small device as I don't have a big kitchen. As I was making peanut butter, the machine just burned after few seconds of use. I would recommend another unit which is stronger. I also did not like the fact that the whole unit was built from plastic."
4,More power than I thought,"This immersion blender had more power than I had initially thought. I mainly use it for milk shakes, and it has performed nicely. It pulverizes oreo cookies and frozen fruit with no problems and makes good, creamy milk shakes.HOWEVER, the motor burnt out after two weeks of use! I called the manufacturer and the customer service rep was genuinely sorry for the performance of the product. She also advised me to pulse, instead of holding onto the button continously, when blending. She was really patient and directed me to a local, authorized store to have the blender fixed. I had no problems dealing with the store. They gave me a new motor unit and said if I had any other problems with it, they would be glad to fix it - I was in and out of the place in 20 minutes.The overall service of the manufacturer and dealer more than made up for the inconvenience of the broken motor."
5,homemade baby food,This product is great for making baby food. It always creates the perfect consistency and is very easy to clean.
4,Many years of service,"I have a slightly older version of this hand blender (#4169 160W) and have used it for the past 10 years with great satisfaction. I plan to purchase a new one though (this time the Braun MR5550MBC-HC Professional Hand Blender with a stainless steel shaft) because as much as I use my current one, the plastic guard around the blade melted and deformed slightly when pureeing a hot soup and has not fit the chopper attachment exactly right since. Also, I dropped my chopper containter and it's being held together with tape! I use the mixer and or chopper almost daily & because I do not like to have lots of appliances in my kitchen cabinets, it really fits the bill. Overall, I think you will be very happy with this model."
2,Useful while it lasted!,"I bought this multiquick hand blender in June of last year. I mainly bought it because I have arthritus and stiring hurts my hands. Although I figured I'd have a lot of uses for it, and maybe I could have found a few more, but all I have ever used it for was stiring koolaide and a few other liquids. However, I still was very happy to have bought it as it really helped save me some pain.Unfortunately, I went to stir koolaide yesterday and the button which you push to make it run completely broke. I could feel it with my thumb just crumble under the rubber covering. Now I can hear pieces shaking around in side and it doesn't work at all.Not very impressive life for something that has only been used to stir koolaide!!!"
2,Great only if it doesn't break fast..,"I bought this blender twice because it is very useful and handy. Yet, it breaks really fast. The motor suddenly stops working. It happened twice, I bought it, used it, then after a year (as if it's an expiration date or something) it stops working! I will try another one, a stainless steel one this time as I realized I mostly use it for soups. Hope it'll last longer."
2,Good while it lasted,"I bought it in MayIt was great while it lasted which was about 1 week. and then the motor burnt. I have sent it back for warranty repairs, and I am waiting to get it back (Aug-19: they are still waiting for the spare parts!!)"
5,great space saving product,"I got this as an anniversary gift 2 years ago. It's one of the best gifts I ever got. It performs as well as the larger ones, yet takes up little counter space.I would recommend this as a shower, wedding, house wraming gift. It would make a great gift for someone going off to college, too."
1,Disappointment,"I found this product to be a disappointment. The descriptions did not clearly indicate that it could only be used with a cord. Moreover, it has only a single (high)speed motor. These two limitations make it a product of little practical utility."
3,handy but not tough enough,"I used the set for almost 2 years and found it versatile. The plastic parts of the chopper are not very strong and they gave up eventually. The iron pole in the middle of the chopping container came out at the plastic junction where it bonds the container. The other accessories just work fine. And, the motor may heat up quickly if you have to make it work too much."
1,I haven't received these items yet.,The above or the blender are MIA. I was going to contact you about thesePat
4,Love it!!!,"I have always wanted a Hand Blender until my husband got me one for our anniversary a couple of months ago. I used the hand blender the first time to make creamy mushroom soup. I ended up cleaning my whole kitchen. Now I've figured out how to use it without messing up my kitchen. So, be careful the first time. Once you get the hang of it, it works like a charm. The chopper attachment is the one I use almost everyday. The best thing about this product is the cleanup. Everything is dishwasher safe. Life doesn't get any easier than this.I gave it 4 stars because I would prefer different speed settings."
3,Braun MR430HC/AC Multiquick Deluxe Hand Blender & Chopper,"The chopper mechanism in this purchase is not good. It grinds at the bottom to mush and the upper parts are still whole. The whip mechanism is OK, except, because it is long, it splatters all over the place. Braun should make the whip shorter so that the splatters stay in the bowl, not all over the person's kitchen and shirt."
1,"Really, no stars.. maybe one star for the laughs","Did you ever see that hilarious film with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk called ""Inlaws""? Remember the scene on the private plane where a Chinese-only-speaking man explains to the passengers how to use the inflatable safety gear? Braun's instruction sheet inspires the same hilarity, except that I'd paid for the bleep thing! I ordered this because it seemed to be a clone of the little Moulinex hand blender I once had. No way. This is poorly designed, awkward, and does nothing that you couldn't do faster and easier without. Bummer. 50 cents in the garage sale."
2,A flash in the pan,"This Braun immersion blender worked beautifully the first time I used it; I made a creamy potato soup that was simply to die for. However, the second time I used it, to chop nuts using the chopper attachment, the motor burned out completely in a matter of minutes. Then I discovered that Braun has discontinued the product and all others like it, so I was unable to replace the motor. The service representative was very nice and said to return the product for a refund, which I did, and which I have not yet received. My advice is choose another brand, no matter how good the price is on this one. The concept, however, is wonderful."
1,Blade on processor broke,The blade on the processor portion broke while I was trying to process breadcrumbs. Performed adequately on soft items such as vegetables but not suitable for harder foods like dried bread or nuts.
1,Multiquick breakdown,"Until now my experiences with Braun products have been good.The Braun handblender I own and use in Europe works very well.This product, however, did not live up to expectations.The first time I used it, a burned smell developed after a few minutes of blending, and the blender stopped. It's no longer useable."
2,Prefer larger 400 watt model,"I ordered this product because I had broken my 400 watt blender by trying to use it on frozen solid strawberries. Unfortunately, it just stopped and wouldn't work again. I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the 200watt version, as I'd read that it ws just as good as the 400 watt and the extra wattage was not necessary. Although I have no problem with the function of the lower wattage motor, I did find that the workbowl was too small and ingredients spilled onto the countertop when I tried to put them in it. This didn't happen with the workbowl of the larger one, as the mouth is wider. This may not be a problem for other people, but I prefer the larger equipment to make things more streamlined in the kitchen."
5,Great stick blender!,Really gets the job done. Quick to clean. Easy to use for those small or medium jobs and a snap in a pinch. Very recommended!
4,Works great -- but beware of carrots,"I really like this thing. It replaced my full-size food processor, which was too bulky and hard-to-clean for casual use in a home kitchen. This hand blender is quick and simple. My old roommate had a similar Braun model and we used it to make soups and smoothies all summer, nearly daily.One problem, though. The other day I made a carrot soup and the white plastic blender wand became somewhat stained yellow. Admittedly I didn't bother to read the manual to see if carrots are a no-no, but who reads manuals for blenders? And what kind of blender is it if it can't puree carrots? I didn't use any curry/turmeric (I was only blending cooked onions and carrots, chicken stock, pinch of nutmeg powder) so I'm pretty sure the carrots are to blame.So now there's this cosmetic issue. I'll overlook it, though, because otherwise the blender works just great."
2,Loved it...til it broke,"I've had this model for 6 mos. I LOVED it! My favorite part actually wasn't the immersion blender (because I didn't use it that often) but was the mini chopper. Yesterday, I went to chop an onion in it and one of the blades broke off. An ONION! While I've been online for 15 minutes trying to contact Braun about it, I've yet to find the correct location - even to purchase another blade. Thus the 3 stars..."
4,Makes great smoothies,"I got this to use when I want to quickly blend something - I have a tiny kitchen so a blender is out. It makes GREAT smoothies and tears through things like strawberries, mixes very well. However, the chopping function really pulverized my onions instead of chopping them so go easy on it - it really only takes a pulse or two. Overall, I am happy to own this and it takes up minimal space and time to assemble."
1,motor died after twice use,"This kit looks good, and did good job when I used it to whip egg white, however, it broke when I used it second time. overheat burned the motor. Never buy this."
5,Delightful item!,Perhaps we are too easy to please but this is a small economical kitchen aid that my wife and I find performs a variety of tasks extremely well. It replaced a Thunderstick that gave out on us all to easily and we find it much more convenient with which to work and we suspect is better built---but admittedly that is guess---we are not engineers.
4,Put God In Your Hand,"This little baby feels like your holding a small rocket. It can chop the heck out of almost anything, and it is easy to use. Fallback; drop it once and the body cracks and it's kapput."
4,Good space saver,"I was looking for a good basic chopper/blender that wouldn't take up much kitchen space. This product does a great job without taking up the room that a normal blender would. Of course it doesn't have all the features that a real blender does, but it does do basic chopping and blending with ease."
4,surprising very useful,"Bought this for my daughter because she loves gadgets, never thinking I would want one for myself. After using it at her house, I think this is a great little machine. Use it many times in place of my blender, food processor and mixer. Very easy to clean. Don't use it for heavy mixing, not made for that."
2,Useful but...,"You can read the pro from other reviewers. The con about this gadget is that the handle gets hot within 30 sec of used, but not to the point being burned. Braun should have included an on/off button. It is very tiresome to have to constantly press the button. The button on mine has to press firmly. The reason I gave One star is because it stop working less than 3 hours of total used (about 1 month).Don't get me wrong this is an awesome product when it worked. I will be ordering their professional version (MR5550MBC-HC) and hope it's more reliable. This time I'll remember to save the receipt."
2,don't ask it to work too hard,"I have owned two of these over the past two years or so, and both died. The gear that the motor drives is plastic, but the blade shaft this gear drives is metal. If what you're mixing is too heavy or thick, the blade shaft will start to strip the teeth on the plastic drive gear, eventually stripping it so the motor won't drive the blade anymore.The second one I had just died while I was mixing a smoothie. It just started slowing down, then died, accompanied by a faint burning smell. I think I burned out the motor on this one.If you're just mixing protein drinks and they're not too thick, your might be OK. I made mine very thick and I added ice. Ice does not make it happy.In general, I'm not impressed by the construction and the fact that I've had two of these fail. I won't buy another Braun."
3,Great Appliance - Poor Quality Control,"After less than one year the shaft broke on my first Braun blender and the... shipping cost to get [the] appliance fixed didn't seem worth it so I bought a second one. That one was better than the first because the working end comes off and can go in the dishwasher but after only 8 months the On/Off switch broke and now this one is useless as well. Plus, this time I can't find the Proof of Purchase ...If I could find another blender as light-weight and as comfortable to use as this one I would buy it -BUT- here I am to purchase my third..."
4,Great kitchen tool!,"This hand blender is great. The power is good and it makes little noise. The chopper portion of it is okay but I found it difficult to chop vegetables the way I wanted it. You have to cut up the vegetables beforehand and then only put a small amount in the chopper for it to work properly. Other than that, I've had it for several months now and it is working great."
4,"Good hand blender, good price.","Works great, mounts on wall nicely. I docked it a star because it is messy, I have to hold a towel over bowls or cups so it doesn't splash everywhere,,also the beater attachment is long and messy and will splash. It takes awhile getting used to so you don't make a huge mess. It has a hard time chopping up ice, but does it. This works best in a long, tall container, if you prepare in bowls, it's messy. And when you first use the chopper, watch out for plastic peices that you will accidentlly chop up, it's a packaging that covers the blades inside the chopper/dicer attachment."
4,great little tool,"i love gadgets and this one is great, it cant be beat for the price. its one versatile kitchen tool that doesnt take up much room. finally found somthing other than a huge food processor to make mock mashed potatoes(cauliflower). beats blends and mixes like nobodys business. looks pretty sturdy and durable, been giving it a good workout. like they say, try it, you'll like it. but buy it from amazon.com. i love those guys"
3,Love It But Can't Wash It,"I love everything about this kitchen gadget. It is like having a blender, a whipper for egg whites and cream, a salad dressing maker and a blending wand that I can put directly into soups. I love it. It has one major flaw, however. You cannot put the top of the chopper into the dishwasher, nor can you submerge it into water. Once its been submerged, the water does not drain out and can cause major bacteria to grow. When you shake it, you can hear the water in there. To clean it, I have to wipe it only. It's a drawback to a great little kitchen device."
1,Motor dies,"The motor of this thing died and almost burned my hand in the process. I was trying to chop raisins (bad idea, however no word about that in the instructions... they tell you to not chop cheese, but nuts are said to be OK) and after a couple of seconds, a spark came out of the button where I was holding the blender(since you need to press the button to have it work, you have to hold it there).If you do not stress this thing too much, it might be useful, however know you cannot rely on it -- it could break at any given time that it decides a job is too hard for it. It doesn't have any tripper or anything so it just dies and needs replacement."
1,do not buy!,Braun MR430HC Multiquick Deluxe Hand Blender & ChopperIt broke the 3rd time I used it (grating parmesan cheese). it overheats and stops working.It is too small for most chopping and dily use.junk!
2,Enjoy it while it lasts,"This will burn out on you if you try to chop ice or frozen fruits. Mine was fine for lesser tasks like protien shakes, but died within 2 years because of frozen mango chunks. My sister had one that died on her within the same time frame because of trying to use it to crush ice. It is underpowered for the tasks that the accessories were designed for. Get a real blender instead."
1,Great when it worked!,"Unfortunetly it stopped working after about 2 weeks of use. Just died, but when it worked it was great, maybe I just recieved a bad one...."
2,broke after the second try,"The stick blender worked well, but what's the use if it cannot withstand prolonged periods of blending? The problem with this stick blender (and some others as well) is that there are no ventilation holes to let out the heat. As a result, all of the heat gets trapped inside of the blender, and it eventually burns out the motor. Buy at your own risk."
4,Great all purpose tool,I had purchased another brand for my daughter to make smoothies at college but before she went I found myself using her's instead of my big kitchen aid counter mixer. It was so easy to do just a little sauce or whipped cream. This one is so powerful. The grinder/chopper attachment I haven't mastered so I tend to get it to ground up- you can literally make a sauce of onion etc. very quickly. Very versatile!!!Update too good to be true- it didn't last long.
2,Was useful while it lasted,"I bought this hand blender two months ago. Made good use of it chopping mostly garlic, onion, and a few times, spices. Then all of a sudden, it stopped working while pureeing onions.What a dissapointment. Looks like the manuafactering of this blender has gone downhill or I had received a defective one.Beware buyers."
4,Good product,"I bought this hand blender for making split pea soup. Using the hand blender made the soup so much creamier. My husband has Diabetes 2 and he loves his sweets. I make him the instant, no sugar, no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable. So far the blender is working just great."
1,Shockingly bad,"I had one of these Braun handblenders for about 2+ years and used it about once every 4-6 weeks. The last time I used it I got a bad electrical shock that left my arm numb for the rest of the afternoon. It took me awhile to get over my fear of this type of appliance, but I eventually bought a KitchenAid brand hand blender and am MUCH happier with it. Sometimes a bargain is not a bargain."
4,blender & chopper,I mostly use it as an immersion blender & a small food processor--instead of bringing out the whole big thing just to chop up carrots for a salad--it's perfect.
4,Prajakta,Very useful for daily use. I use it to efficiently chop onions which is a most frustrating job otherwise!
1,broken in the first day,"I was so glad with my new blender and choper, and I decided to make a ""sufl"" but in my first day of using it it just stoped working! What a disapointment! But I don't want to have the trouble of having to pay of sending the product back to get another one... but I'm really really disapointed because I liked the product, but it just stoped working so soon... and I had followed completely all the instructions on the manual... What a pitty!"
2,Nothing Great!,"This is a useful product for many if it's used only to make shakes/drinks or just chop.If you buy this to make baby food,it's not such a great one Braun has to offer.There is a better model in Model # MR440HC,which is available with price club & is much cheaper."
5,Works great!! : ),"I am really satisfied with this purchase I made. Its been a while since I bought this and it still works great, very handy and very useful. Blend milk shakes, blend chutneys, make curry pastes for gravy. It makes everything so convenient!!Worth the price!"
4,Good variety of options - Handy means very handy,"I enjoyed the product at a price of about $25. The only drawback was that the blender jug is so small that you may have to use it more than once to get the required quantity done. However, should be suitable for 1 - 2 persons.Very handy tool and excellent value for money. Just be ware of its HANDINESS. Very handy, thus suitable for small uses. Do not expect it to process volumes and volumes of stuff."
3,Don't chop soap with this!,"So, I know, I know... I didn't exactly follow the directions for this product. After chopping (what I thought were) very manageable little pieces of soap in the chopper attachment, and having the motor totally heat up and die in the middle of my soap recipe, I took a glance at the instruction booklet. That is where I noticed the company's recommendation that you not chop chocolate with the machine, but that chopping small amounts of nuts was acceptable. Hmm... interesting. I decided maybe soap was closer to chocolate than nuts, dammit! So I was very, very sad to have totally killed my machine, and I suppose I will have to invest in a professional grade hand blender for my toiletries endeavors. Turns out the horsepower just wasn't enough. Boo. Anyway, I am sure this is a great machine for its intended uses -- just don't stray from the directions!!"
1,BAD BAD BAD if you are buying it to chop,"Well, the only reason I bought it was to use it as a chopper. It fails miserably. Not sure about other functions, didn't try those. But when used to chop, it instead minces them and all you get is a paste. same is true for any other vegetable.."
2,Swell until it broke,"I used mine strickly for mixing protein shakes consisting ofjust milk and mix. I never used any ice, or nuts or anything remotelytenuous for a mixer that size. Anyway, about a year after I bought it,the blade stopped turning. Upon further inspection, I discovered theinside had rotted. In addition to being a huge drag, it was also grossand likely a harbinger for bacteria. It worked fine until it broke,but now I'm out the $... dollars I paid for it. I would like tomention that I also purchased a similar $... mixer that broke in amonth. So, perhaps these things have a limited life span if you usethem daily. Either way, similar to pet turtles, don't get to attachedto your wand mixers. END"
1,don't buy,buy this if you want to mix light shakes. Do not buy if you want to blend anything heavier. The motor burned out in less than a week. It's garbage.
2,Great game,"This is a great game, it's fun, replayable and moderately challenging, but easy to learn.To comment on the review below, when I first played this game on my old computer the characters were just gray outlines as well, however on my new computer I get full color units, so he probably had the same level of lousy video card I did at the time. This game is fun, basically you control a group of warriors in a tournament style combat. It's an overhead view, and there are traps, everything can be destroyed... it's just fun and mayhem."
5,I can't say enough,"This is a book that I would recommend to just about anyone. Not only is Betty Carter down-to-earth, she is incredibly funny! I don't normally laugh out loud while reading, but several times I found myself shaking in my chair trying to contain my laughter.Her honest account of her own struggles proves that there is hope for all of us."
1,Leave it alone,"I read this book twice. After reading that the author is compared to Anne Lamott and was so transparent, I thought I must have missed something. So I re-read the book - and no, I didn't miss anything. The author really says nothing and reveals little. She has difficulty w/ getting possessive w/ her female friends, but she never explores what could be causing that at all. Reminds me of someone who climbs up to the high dive platform, but then never dives off."
1,It's debauched alright.,"I don't know what I was expecting. This genre really isn't my thing but I was curious enough to try. Although the woman is looking to liven up her boring life, she just didn't seem as if she were enjoying herself at all. Maybe I read her all wrong. I totally did not dig the ending. I think it went way over my head because I just didn't get it. Oh well, I wanted to see what was going on. I saw, and now I'm wondering why I wanted to see what was going on."
3,Oh well,This was a test for me as I can see the movie is a little too much for me. I guess S/M stuff is just not my bag.
3,Kinda' Sorta',The cover picture is about all you get. It is very soft porn so if you are looking for more this is not for you.
2,unclear movie,I can not watch the movie clearly. Because you try to hide some scenes. I do not know why they do that.
1,Hardcore! I gave this movie a 1 star rating. I bought this movie out of curiosity and was expecting something a little more tam,"I gave this movie a 1 star rating. I bought this movie out of curiosity and was expecting something a little more tame. The story itself wasn't bad but, (even though the camera angles leave it to your imagination) the sex scenes are extreme! The women in this movie are treated like objects and are beaten unmercifully and are forced into extremely painful sexual acts. In a couple of scenes, I would say the woman was raped.If you are attracted to Japanese women this movie won’t disappoint you, but as I said, in this movie they are objects and I found this movie’s subject matter distasteful!This movie wasn’t to my taste, but if you are into extreme hardcore porn, this movie might be more to your liking."
1,Terrible sound quality,This cd has terrible sound quality. I'm disappointed I won't be able to use it for my wedding.
1,It's computer generated,"I guess if you are looking for computer generated, sort of music-like material, you might want this ... well, no, you might seriously do better with free MIDI files found on the Internet. I'm not kidding - a MIDI file generated from a good ABC score of the tune would likely sound better.Seriously, listen to the samples for this. Then listen to the tunes played by an actual player - any player (try YouTube). Think about tempo, being in tune, whether it even sounds like a real person playing a real instrument. Think carefully before you buy."
2,Don't buy this,"This series must be one of the most overrated I've ever seen. I'd been waiting almost twenty years to watch it - ever since I read about it in a book called ""MTM: Quality Television."" What a disappointment!Another reviewer puts it bluntly: it just isn't funny. There's no doubt Dabney Coleman is very good, but Bittinger's not as odious a character (and therefore original) as I'd been led to believe. Danny DeVito/Louis De Palma on ""Taxi"" did it better years before. Moreoever, Coleman doesn't have any funny lines to say.The show is weakly written and the humour rather obvious. It's certainly not a terrible show, but it's not worth owning."
2,"Abandoned in life, abused in the afterlife...","Buffalo Bill - The Complete First and Second SeasonsAh, as a teenager, I so enjoyed this show. Pretty shifty for a sitcom, it caught some of us as well as a good many critics. But the network didn't know what to do with it, lacking faith in their little duck of a show. With such a crap transfer and an obnoxious laugh track, this set begs a question:Why bother releasing something if you're not going to respect it at all?!?4 stars for the show, 0 stars for the release = 2 stars"
2,"CANTANKEROUS, IRRITATING, ARROGANT, EGOTISTIC, RACIST JERK CAN BE FUNNY, BUT . . .",". . . Only, maybe, in short bites. But buying the Season 1&2 and seeing all episodes end-to-end is definitely overloading. The bile is only diluted by the brightness of a beautifully-young Geena Davis and the smart sexiness of Joanna Cassidy. By the end of Season Two, Bill just seemed plain vile and mean-spirited.Although there were some moments, the overdone caricatures of the milk-toast producer, continuously- obsequious stage manager and stilted/ dated writing makes Bill into buffalo chips. Dabney Coleman is a terrific talent; if the writing and characters were better done, he and his ensemble could've, should've made it past the two-season mark by a long, long way."
2,"All the right ingredients, except for one; LAUGHS.","Here's an example of a sitcom that had a perfect cast, a great plot, and even a cool theme song. It just wasn't (and still isn't) very funny. Almost every ""joke"" falls flat. But don't worry, if you should find yourself NOT laughing at any of the jokes, the annoying ""laugh track"" (canned laughter) seems to be having a great time!If not for the 80's nostalgia and great cast, which includes Dabney Coleman, Joanna Cassidy, and a very young Geena Davis, this would be a VERY painful viewing experience. Don't believe the critics who cliam it was ""too hip"" to survive. The reason you're not laughing isn't because you ""don't get it"", it's because it isn't very funny. A shame that Jim Borrows and Glen and Les Charles (Taxi, Cheers) weren't at the helm, then it might have had some REAL laughs and could have become a true classic!Still worth a look for 80's nostalgia hounds!JM"
2,Disgusted,"Bought this expressly for THE classic sitcom scene of all time, ""Hit The Road Jack."" Instead of this scene, a written apology appears, saying the scene has been excised due to licensing problems. Thanks for the apology ater you got my dough. Be warned, America!"
2,CHEATED !,"Like the other reveiwer, I purchased this set specifically for the ""Hit The Road"" episode. The music scene was deleted from the episode with an apology explaining failure to get permission. Why did'nt they simply leave the sound out but include the video ? It still would have been funny. This same thing happened to a portion of the ""Elegant Iggy"" episode of Taxi Season 4. Selling these incomplete dvd sets simply puts the screws to the consumer. Before buying, I now check the availability at my local Library."
4,TV History,"It was said that Brandon Tartikoff who was in charge of NBC's programming always regretted that he pulled the plug on the show. Supposedly he later included the show in his ""dream schedule"", when he took on a ""TV GUIDE"" assignment of providing his ultimate TV programming schedule. I used the show in a ""History of Television"" course I taught to illustrate some of the changing programming trends of the 1980s. Like others, I also was disappointed about the missing ""hit the road Jack"" sequence, as I had read so much about that particular episode."
1,Stupider than stupid....,"This is unbelievably bad.I came across this at a huge record shop recently, and was intrigued by the interesting packaging and the header of ""Music Box Biographical Collection"".Fool I am, I bought this and was never more let down by anything. This is SO bad....not only is the entire program not even shown full screen but 'inside' a cartoon, ultra-cheesy 'television set'; the annoying female narrator mixes up dates in Madonna's career; footage from the 90s is shown during discussion of her 80s career and visa-versa; everything is VERY low-quality; and at one point footage of a Madonna impersonator performing as Madonna is shown, and passed off as being Madonna herself! The quality and cheap effects look like they were done in a high school video production class in the early 90s. Seriously, they do.Do NOT buy this! I would like to give this zero stars. One is being TOO generous."
1,Not worth buying.,I watched this and felt cheated from the very beginning. It's just a slide show with a woman narrating annoyingly. Do yourselves a favor and do not buy this.
4,The last battle with the Basanos. Maybe.,"Mike Carey, Lucifer: The Divine Comedy (Vertigo, 2003)I'd thought the third volume wrapped up a story arc or two. I was wrong. Carey had more up his sleeve here as Lucifer, the Lilim, the Basanos, and Elaine Belloc all converge on Lucifer's alternate universe for a big, nasty struggle in which Lucifer finds himself help from a few places he didn't realize it was coming, the Basanos try to take over the world (so what else is new?), and the Lilim keep whining. Meanwhile, Michael may be back in Heaven, but it seems he learned some things down on Earth that don't have his boss all that pleased... once again, Carey takes the legacy of Neil Gaiman, runs with it, and comes up with a winner. Fantastic stuff, this. ****"
3,It's just OK,"I'm not a big fan of Wusthof's new cheaper line. I expect the quality of Wusthof, but the product isn't to the par I expected."
1,Deceived by brand name,"The machine came with the steam wand broken. Not factory packed.Design is attractive, although all plastic and not very sturdy.Good refund service from Amazon.Bought a Di Longhi at half the price of La Pavoni, looks and works great.Case of brand name deception."
2,Unrealistic & Superficial,"Like the other reviewer, I was excited to buy this book. Unfortunately, the plotting is simplistic & the character development lacking. Shaun & Harry, the two main characters, are one-dimensional and smarmy. About the only tension is provided by the Shaun's mother, who is a one-dimensional shrew. Because I didn't see any depth in the characters, I didn't believe in them. The story goes nowhere."
3,15x30 silver tarp,this 15 by 30 foot tarp is huge. it is a very thin tarp but is sturdy. i just avoided using the eyelet holes to strap it down and it has worked like a charm without tearing.
1,Not my Cup of Tea!,"This ""book"" had no real advice on raising children; unless you want them to be spoiled for the rest of their lives. I would suggest ANY book to you, except this one."
5,awesome fiddling,"This is my favorite Kevin Burke recording, and right up there among my favorite collections of fiddle tunes by any artist. These tunes, recorded relatively early in Burke's impressive career, may seem somewhat less-refined than his later work with the Bothy Band and Patrick Street, but his extraordinary talent on the fiddle really stands out with no distraction from accordians, uillean pipes, etc. in the background. The selection of tunes is excellent, and whether your passion is Irish traditional music or blugrass, you'll likely recognize and appreciate many of these numbers. I like it more and more every time I listen, but give the samples a listen if you're in doubt as to whether you'll appreciate this CD as much as I do."
5,The Bluegrass Mystery,"Charles ""The Bluegrass Mystery"" Sawtelle died on March 21 1999. Music from Rancho de Ville is a celebration of life and music. A stellar group of friends had gathered at Rancho de Ville over the years to enjoy the roots of tradition. These are the resulting beautiful original tunes recorded with friends of Bluegrass, Cajun, Old-time and Tex-Mex. You might know him for his sincere soft-spoken vocals and guitar artistry with Hot Rize. This is a must have all-star gem wellproduced by Laurie Lewis. The line up includes David Grisman, Vassar Clements, Norman Blake, Tim O'Brien Sam Bush just to mention a few!"
5,Honestly Conceived - Beautifully Created,"I first saw A CRISIS OF FAITH on public access television. I only caught part of the program but was completely captured by the obvious honesty of the message. I immediately found and purchased the video. The visual effects, music, and trance-inducing commentary work together to provide a very pleasant viewing experience. On a philosophical level, this is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen. The theme of this film will touch you deep inside. I did not see this film as a total condemnation of our society but rather a statement on the problems that our society tends to ignore. It suggests that as a people, we at the very least change our social priorities."
2,Leaves Something to be Desired,"This book does not, in my opinion, live up to the standard that I have come to expect from Mr. Keillor. For the first time, I will not finish the book, since I find too much of it to be (putting it mildly) boring. There are many excellent Keillor books, I just did not find this to be one of them. Spoken as a fan of Garrison."
4,Even more great storytelling!,"Keillor is simply an excellent storyteller -- what more can I say?While this collection is not, perhaps, his best stuff (I recommend ""Lake Wobegon Days"" for beginners), the stories are nevertheless endearing and well-crafted."
5,Good CSet Book,"I'm a CSet trainer in the valley. We use this text exclusively to prepare our candidates. They are very pleased with the book, the thoroughness of the information, and their final results. The author even sent us sample exam info, which was very valuable. Normally, I would not write a review of a test prep book, but its nice to find something of actual value and use out there."
2,"adequate material, but no practice tests","This book contains nearly all of the required topics on the CSET, but it doesn't have any practice tests. I find that practice tests are helpful, so I was disappointed that there were none. Of all the CSET books available, I have found the Kaplan book to be most helpful. The material is condensed and written in a language that flows better than the others. It has practice sets and sample tests, and the questions seem to mirror the actual test material more accurately. There are also less typos and incorrect answers supplied by the Kaplan book, which unfortunately proved to be an obstacle with the others."
2,Too many errors in this book!,"I am currently using this book in preparing for the CSET. I have found many grammatical errors, but more troubling are the mathematical errors I have found. Since when does: 4 + (-3) + (-6) = 5. (should be -5)OR 5 x 1/5 + 0 = 0. (should be 1) These are just 2 of the 6 problems I have found *so far* which is especially unsettling when it is a book whose sole purpose is to prepare teachers for a major test! The problems get worse when dealing with dividing polynomials, and they make a blatant error in the division which messes up the whole problem and makes it impossible to know if I am doing it right. I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."
2,DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!,This is not a good book to study with. IT has waaaaayy too much unneccessary information that you will never remember. The math section goes beyond what you need to know for the cset. The only part I found helpful was the test taking strategies and time management charts. The Cliff's notes CSET book is A LOT better. There is an outline for each section and two practice tests. There are practice math problems as well. Much easier book to understand.
1,Poor test prep resource,"This book almost seems dishonest in its presentation. Rather than helping you prep information for the test, it routinely gives you stratgies to ""beat"" the test. While all of us want to pass the CSET, to have done it in a fashion by jumping questions, ignoring rules, etc. is not a way to do this."
2,Eh ...,"I'm a little shocked. I would think that a study guide would have some practice questions and sample tests, but this book has none."
1,Don't Study From This Book!,"I used this book to study for the Math/Science CSET. During my studies, I noticed a lot of errors within the book in the math and science section. For example: The book states that melting is when a liquid becomes a solid! Now I know what they meant, but that should have been caught when this book was edited!Also, in the math section: LOTS OF ERRORS! I used to be a math major and I know what I'm talking about! If you use this book to study, pay attention to numbers being brought down incorrectly. If you don't know math, you won't catch the mistakes.I didn't go through the rest of the book. I don't trust the other sections of this book. After all, if the math/science portion of this book has many mistakes--other sections of this book probably have mistakes, as well!"
3,Good value for beginners,"The item arrived really quickly and that was a nice surprise. The bridge does not come intact, but it is really easy to put in place. There is a problem with the pegs as they do not stay in place and consequently you have to continually readjust and do not get the tone that you need to. The case is not the same, the one I received came with a red velvet interior. Otherwise good value for your money as a first time violin."
3,Happy customer,"I purchased this item as a gift for my niece. She already has a ""good"" violin, this was bought just for the fun factor. The violin didn't arrive the exact same color as the violin pictured but the seller was quick to make everything right. It was shipped and arrived safely. The case is a very nice case and worth the price I paid for the set alone. While the violin has a few imperfections on the wood and paint it is still a great buy. Perfect for a beginner violinist. I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
1,"Cheap Quality, Cheap Coffee, Expensive Unit","We were replacing a dear eleven year old Bosch. You can't buy Bosch stateside any longer, so I chose what I thought would be an acceptable substitute. My good friends have a twelve year old Braun and have been happy with it. First thing we noticed with this unit was that it steamed like Old Faithful. So much steam in fact, we were concerned it would damage our cabinets. So we adjusted and now pull the unit as far away from the cabinets as possible. And what you've read about the carafe is absolutely true. This is so thin and fragile, I'm certain it will be broken before I get a chance to buy a new machine. We have not used the water purifier and don't think we need in our area, however, the coffee is extremely cloudy using PAPER filters. I couldn't be more dissatisfied. And I am angry knowing that we just missed our 30 day return policy. I wish I had read the reviews on this website. They got me with the ""ranked by a leading consumer magazine""."
1,overpriced high-falutin' junk,"I really hated this coffee pot, which we used until it broke after 2 years. I felt too guilty to trash it...My number one reason for disliking it is that the carafe is designed in such a way as to always spill, drizzling coffee down the side of the carafe onto the counter every time I poured a cup. The second thing I disliked about it was the fact that the control buttons for the time, etc., would constantly jam. They were little push-buttons and would get stuck ""in"". Also, did I mention that every time I made coffee, the faulty carafe was a hassle because the water had to be poured into the top and of course, water would get all over the counter.It sure made coffee fast, though. (5 min. for a pot). Also, the coffee it made was tasty. But...I expect tasty AND non-messy."
2,Bits and Pieces,"It's true that this coffee maker makes good coffee. However, the carafe is so thin that we broke three before switching to a different coffee maker. Check out the review of the replacement carafe before purchasing this item."
5,Pickey Coffee Drinker finally found THE pot!,"This coffee maker makes the best coffee I have ever had. I like coffee...not vanilla, chocolate, moca coffee...just good coffee. This pot makes it the way I like it. I have now converted the people at work and we bought the Braun for our coffee club. The only minor difficulty we have had is finding the water filter replacements."
1,2 in less than one year is two too many,I've purchased two Braun KF187W FlavorSelect 12-Cup Coffeemakers in less than one year -- the first one lasted just four months -- too old to return to the store. I figured it was just a fluke and bought another. Here I am again with a dead coffee maker. I think Braun has lowered their quality standards. I'll never buy another Braun coffeemaker.
2,Braun not responsive to bad coffee maker,"I bought this item here at Amazon.com. I was excited to get it since I am always forgetting to turn off my coffee pot. I liked the design and the built in filter. I had used it for two weeks when it started shutting off before two hours, but it still was okay. Then it started shutting off during brewing. I took it in to the official Braun representative in our area. They wouldn't replace it, but they said they would repair it. After three phone calls and three months I finally got it back. According to the repair place they had to repeatedly ask Braun for the parts. I guess since it was a manufacturing problem and wasn't making them more money it wasn't a priority. It works, for now, but I don't have a lot of confidence. It is suppose to shut off after two hours and it does it after an hour and a half."
2,Fine while it lasts,"Mine quit working when the filter basket mechanism failed and water would not pass through it after about 6 months. It made good coffee, but I don't think it gave me the value I expected. Seems like it should last longer than that."
1,Beware! I've had TWO fail on me.,"I really like the looks of the coffee machine, the features, and the cup of coffee that it makes...but my first one stopped working after only 6 months and my replacement just failed me after only 4 months! Never again."
1,Watch Out for This One - It's Not Warranteed!!!,"Bought this in July, and yesterday a 1/2"" jagged crack opened in the middle of the reservoir casing - not even near a seam. Called Braun, and they told me that it is no longer manufactured and, therefore, not under warranty - even though, as far as I'm concerned, it's only 7 weeks old! Amazon won't take it back: it's more than 30 days since we ordered it.That was our third Braun, and our last."
4,Silly idea,"Don't get me wrong... you can make a good cup of coffee with the Braun KF187W. BUT, the idea of ""flavor select"" is just plum silly. Want weak coffee? Use fewer beans and don't grind them so fine. If you buy one of these, set that sucker on ""strong"" and go your merry coffee-drinking way."
3,Good coffee???,"While I found this coffee pot to make pretty good coffee, I also realized that I was just as happy with an old ProctorSilex I had. I did find the flavor more enhanced with this pot but I rate it low due to the fact the carafe is too fragile. You can wash in the top rack of dishwasher and the 1st time I did this it was in a million pieces and then had to find somewhere to get a new one, never put in dishwasher again. The carafe is paper thin and it makes one nervous when handling it. I thought for the money I would have been happier with a cheaper pot, that spending more didn't buy me much more at all."
4,Pretty Good,"Having read all the great reviews I decided to get myself this wonder-coffee-maker. Well, i was impressed by the functions and look of the machine but i HATE the thin caraffe and although the coffe is very good it is not significantly better than the coffee my cheaper Mr. Coffee made. In my view, the coffee blend used is much more important to the taste of the coffee cup i make, than the hardware."
5,Makes a great cup of coffee.,"Maker doesn't come with paper filters, used gold filter included and was very disappointed with the taste of the coffee, there was a lot of sediment in the pot. Purchased paper filters and the results was an excellent cup of coffee. Water filter must be soaked before installing and instruction booklet doesn't mention that. After installing filter charcoal bits will float in water tank. I purchased this model instead of the Krups because to the reviews I read here."
2,Braun KF187 Coffeemaker,"Great coffeemaker when the glass carafe isn't broken. This seems to be common problem with this model of coffee maker from Braun (mine lasted 4 months). So much in fact, that I have been unable to find the factory carafe for it.....anywhere...not even here. Until Braun makes a replacement carafe with a thicker glass wall I would buy a different coffeemaker."
2,not pleased,"I purchased the Braun KF587w and had to return it upon inspection as the item was clearly used and damaged (a broken water compartment lid and a scratched carafe`). However Amazon did quickly replace it. But the new one, while being unused, had a defective carafe`. While my wife was washing it a stress crack developed bown beside the handle, going under the handle. While I am very pleased with the features of the coffee maker I am very dissatisfied with the quality."
1,Didn't last long,"This coffee maker had great features while they lasted. I did not find that the coffee temperature adjustment made much of a difference - it was the same regarless of where it was set. The coffee maker only lasted about a year and a half before it ""died"". Not a great value for the money."
3,"Good coffee, but carafes are VERY fragile","First off, this unit makes excellent coffee, no question.Unlike the reviewer that's purchased four carafes, I've only had to purchase THREE of them in TWO years, so I should consider myself lucky, right?The third replacement broke in my hand as I gently washed it with a wet soapy sponge - this was immediately after removing it from the shipping container. They are replacing it for free, but tihs is ludicrous.After forking over (price including shipping) for the first replacement, we started treating them very carefully. Each time they broke, it was from barely tapping them accidentally on the inside of the sink. Again, we are not careless.I'm considering replacing it because it's going to cost way more in the long run if the carafes are going to continue to break..."
5,"The Best, hands down...","I've got to tell you, I owned my 12 cup Braun for almost 10 years, and only had to replace the pot twice for MY negligence...It just recently stopped working, after all those years of HARD use. I WILL replace it with a new one, since it is by far the best coffee maker on the planet.Thanks Braun, or whoever owns you now... :)"
5,actually tastes better,"I wasn't expecting better tasting coffee (I mean, it's just hot water poured through grounds, right?), just convenience. The Braun carafe pours perfectly (yea, no more spilling!). The basket lifts out easily to fill it on the counter, and rinse it in the sink. It's simple to turn on and to program. The burner will go 4 hours instead of 2, which I prefer.But really, the coffee really tastes great. The water filter must help, but part of the answer must be the ""taste selector knob"" or whatever it's called. I think it actually diverts some hot water around the grounds. But what it accomplishes is an end to bitterness, even in not-so-great coffee. And with good beans, it's just perfect."
4,"Excellent, hot coffee, no drips","I bought this to replace my beloved Krups Crystal Arome, which was recalled as a fire hazard. I've had it for 3 weeks now and barring some long-term maintenance problems I love it. It makes nice HOT coffee, the pitcher does not drip (a major advance in coffee science), and it's easy to run. Highly recommended for coffee addicts."
5,I had no idea coffee was supposed to be hot and taste good.,"Ok, I fell for Gevalia's free fancy carafe coffee maker if you buy their coffee. But the carafe's hard to clean and the warmer doesn't really warm and after a few months I got frustrated and replaced my long lost old faithful Braun with the new model. I love the timer feature. Its great waking up to really hot fresh coffee. I don't laze around as much as I used to now that I have a pleasurable reason to get out of bed. I use the spacer since I always start with filtered water anyway so I have no filter complaints. Definitely a BUY recommend."
3,Great Coffee...Till It Broke,This coffee maker made great coffee. The hot plate adjusted the temp and the water filter was a plus (minus the hefty fee for replacements). The gold filter didn't do as good a job as paper filters. There was only one major problem...12 months and 15 days after purchase...it stopped working. Looks like the heating coil went bad. Too bad because we really liked it and now I'm a bit gun shy about another Braun.
3,It was good while it lasted!,"This coffeemaker worked fine, although the unremovable water reservoir tended to get dirty, and the unit had to be moved away from under my cabinet every time I wanted to fill it. The coffee was good, and rarely burned, everything worked the way it should. Until today. I found the clock set at ""7:90"" and none of the controls worked. No coffee this morning! Or any morning until I buy another coffeemaker. I will look for a less expensive model this time."
4,"Good coffee maker, but complicated","This coffee maker makes good coffee if you use the settings and the right grind. It takes some experimenting to get good coffee if the coffee is not ground enough. Also, there are a lot of things to understand before using and maintaining this coffee maker. It was on sale when I bought it and I am glad I did not have to pay full price."
5,What a Great Cup of Coffee!,"When I decided that I needed a new coffemaker, I looked at my favorite warehouse store and saw expensive machines by Cuisinart and less expensive devices by Mr. Coffee. I did a bit of research and determined that the attractive Cuisinart machines don't brew that good a cup of coffee. The reviews all pointed to the Braun KF187.The coffeemaker arrived from Amazon the other day, and I brewed my first pot yesterday. I was amazed - and surprised. I had no idea that the coffee would be so much better than that to which I was accustomed. The reviewers were right, and I suspect it has to do with delivering the water to the grinds at the optimal temperature.While I have yet to explore the fancy features (automatic brewing, etc.), and don't know how much I care about them, I like being able to set the strength of the coffee and have a say in what temperature the pot stays at.This Braun makes an exceptionally good cup of coffee, and that's what I wanted it for."
2,coffeemaker overpriced,"this coffee maker is overpriced. it does not brew at the proper temperature. also it has a programmable device that allows coffee to be made while you sleep,ready for you when you wake up. the problem is any coffee grinded and not used in three hours is stale so this device is useless. look elsewhere for a coffeemaker such as a cuisinart dtc 800 or the kitchenaid ultra 4 cup coffee makers as they brew at the proper temperature"
2,over priced coffeemaker,"i have had two of these but not at my own choice. they were bought by my mother as she thought they were ""safe"" electricallythe first one died in the third year of use but was used heavily,some 3 or 4 times daily on average.the problem is that this coffee maker does not reach the proper brew temperature. also you are paying for a programmable device to brew your coffee ahead of you when you wake up in the mornning. this would be stale coffee as coffee grinded and not used within three hours is stale. so this device on the coffeemaker is useless in my opinion.i would recommend the cuisinart dtc 800 or the kitchenaid ultra 4 cup coffeemakers as these coffeemakers brew coffee at the proper temperature"
2,Temporary at best,"I have owned this coffee pot for about seven months. The first couple, the coffee WAS the best. However, unless you continually change the insert filter, you will soon have bitter, 'filmy' coffee. Personally, I do not prefer mine this way. Then there is the matter of the carafe. Get an extra from the beginning if you purchase this item. (In addition to the extra filtration filters!). I personally would like to have spent the money on three less expensive models and had good coffee the entire time."
2,KF 187 while it lasts,I am 62 years of age. I bought KF 187 12-cup FlavorSelect Braun coffeemaker 1-1/2 years ago because I wanted a coffeemaker that would brew good full-bodied coffee. This coffeemaker does the job as long as the filter basket remains shut. I had trouble from day one keeping the filter basket locked in place. Now I stand over the coffeemaker continually locking the filter basket until my coffee has finished brewing. I am looking for a new coffeemaker that will brew coffee as good as this one but cheaper. I paid[a lot] for this Braun. My previous Mr. Coffee lasted several years and cost anywhere from $20 to $40.
5,The best drip that tastes like perk!,"I have owned my Braun for about 6 months now and I just love it! I was an old fashioned perk only type when I was converted to drip because of Braun. I even performed a test back to back; one pot of perk the other in the Braun and guess what?? Much to my own surprise, I actually PREFERRED the drip!!!!! An incredible coffee pot! 2 thumbs up!"
3,Typical early 70s set by Bloomfield and assorted friends,"Mike Bloomfield performs here with some of his long-time collaborators, including Mark Naftalin and Barry Goldberg, as well as some stellar Bay Area soul and rock artists such as the Pointer Sisters and Spencer Dryden. The music sometimes sounds a lot like a cross between his first solo effort, the disappointing ""It's Not Killing Me,"" and the also disappointing re-grouped Electric Flag's ""The Band Kept Playing."" Some of the songs on this album, however, plainly out-rock those other efforts, making this a worthwhile listen. Probably the weakest part of the album are the vocals by the men singers, especially Bloomfield. Too bad Jellyroll Troy wasn't along on this one! The production values are very good, with a fold-out CD sleeve and nice, clear sound for the music."
5,Dawkins appreciation,"If you have read Richard's books over the years, you will enjoy reading some other prominent peoples' opinions. I am now re-reading ""The selfish gene"""
5,"Regarding Science-Ejected Vitalism, 2007:","I particularly applaud Ruse's statement -- contrary to the position of such nonsensical alternative medicine systems as 'naturopathy' -- that vitalism is profoundly nonscientific, per:""vital forces really have no place in science [p.157].""-r.c."
2,poor product,"I had hoped that the quality of the video would be much better than it was, instead during the middle and late innings of the game the video simply stopped. I tried the dvd in other dvd players with the same results. To say I am disappointed would be an understatment. I truly expected better from Amazon. I could have gotten this type of quality from some back street vendor."
2,Disappointed,"Condensed, I wanted the complete game with old commercials.Didn't even open with the pre-game with Bob Prince andMel Allen. It went straight to the first batter."
5,Highly recommended,It's great to see the complete game especially as a Pirate fan.I highly recommend this its THE most exciting game 7 in baseball history.
5,A piece of history,"This is a treasure. It would have been nice to have included the commercials but it is still a wonderful piece of baseball. I have been a Pirates' fan all my life. When I was a kid I can remember Pie Traynor pitching plumbing ads on TV, the interviews Bob Prince did with Roberto Clemente - he always called him ""Bobby"", and Willie Stargell's ""chicken on the Hill"". And though I was too young to remember Maz's home run, it goes right in there with Franco's Immaculate Reception. Now I can see what I was too young to ever remember. And for that alone, this DVD is worth the few dollars at a time when baseball was king."
1,WOULD NOT LOAD,"Would not load on a modern day PC. A 3yo Dell Inspirion 530, with Vista Premium and all with a little extra RAM added and THIS game would NOT load. A FAILURE in my book. Sorry, but save your money."
1,Wargamers dont waste your time,If you are looking for a RTS challenging game this is not( look first into Sudden Strike series or Blitzkrieg series).Graphics & story are so poor that can you beleive.But is your choise if you wanted.
5,Gorgeous and thoughtful,"If you're interested in the art, religion, or culture of Haiti, this book is fabulous! It shows clear links between Catholic and Vodou imagery and themes, and the art is inspiring. The color photos are rich & wonderful, and consistent enough to provide a clear understanding of Haitian and Vodou artistic/spiritual traditions. In this case, a picture (or pictures in this book anyway) are worth more than 1000 words. If you're interested in Vodou and/or folk arts of the Caribbean, this book is a worthwhile purchase."
3,Dog booties,"The idea is great, but cannot keep them on the dog. Need to use something stronger than velcro. Dog just shakes or tugs off. However they would be good if the dog would cooperate."
2,Dissapointed,I expected this to be more resistant. These things only lasted me a week before my dog ripped a hole in one. They make your dog look cute but it isn't worth it.
2,Destroyed within 12 hours,"I bought these for my boxer because she has degenerative myelopathy and thought they'd be useful for protecting her hind paws, since the disease causes her to drag them to the point of bleeding. I didn't need them to be waterproof, but FYI they're not waterproof in the least. After wearing them on two 30-minute long walks, they were already falling apart and had a huge hole in them, rubber grip on the bottom flapping off. Granted, she does drag her paws so a healthy dog can probably get away with a week's worth of use out of them."
2,Not Waterproof,"These are good in theory. The seller shipped them ridiculously fast. However, as I sent my puppy (he's 60 pounds at 8 months) out in the rain, I was surprised that he came back with these still on. As tight as you can velcro them, he ""could"" use his teeth to take them off. Also I noticed after taking them off, his paws were wet. UGH! Not waterproof as the water went right through them. Defeats the purpose of wiping off his paws. They will be could for avoiding mud ""if"" he comes back with all 4 boots on. I will check for something maybe made of Gor-Tex and that has a better way to hold on the dog's feet. It will be more money, but these are kind of lacking for the purpose they are suppose to serve."
2,Waste of money,"We bought 3 pair of these for our Bichon Frise pups to wear when we take them for their nightly walk. They are fine for snow, but not for wet, dirty pavement. Within a week of walking on the pavement every night there were holes in the toes where the fabric (including the lining) had worn through.I recycled the velcro strips from these boots as fasteners for 12 fleece boots that took about an hour to make. The fleece booties are intact after 3 weeks of daily walks."
3,You Get What You Pay For!,"These were right for the price, to test out whether or not my Mini Aussie liked having anything on his feet (he doesn't). I bought them to use in the snow, but one shake of the paw and they were flung into the yard not to be seen again until the snow melted a month later! Overall, if your dog doesn't mind having these on his/her feet, then they're a good bargain, but they're definitely the quality of a bargain and for anything more than occasional or seasonal use, spend the money on a good pair of high quality dog boots."
1,Disappointed and really not waterproof,Boots looked great but they didn't stop from having the dogs paws getting soaked in the rain. Total waste of money.
2,They are simple basics but don't quite get the job done,"The booties have a lovely faux-shearling cuff at the top as pictured - which is great - but the rest of the boot is nothing but thin nylon. I have 2 chihuaua mixes, 8 and 10 lbs each, and the extra small is very large on the smaller one - the traction area under the paw is so wide and it makes him walk quite funny.The boots are too short; I tighten the strap as much as I can without cutting off circulation, but they have a tendency to fall off during the walk because they don't cover the joint.I've given up on the booties in general and resorted to applying a waxy balm to their paws to prevent direct contact with the salt. After getting 8 booties on, adjusting the 2-3 that inevitably fall off during this process, and then having them fall off during the walk just isn't worth it."
4,Weather Boots For My Boxer Puppy,The Boots are constructed well. It has a small plastic grip pad underneath. You have to strap them on tightly so that it will stay on . They kept his feet dry in the rain and in the snow. ( during 30 min ) at a time.I'm pretty happy with the product. I ordered a large for a 4 month old Boxer and it should last him through the winter.
3,wrong size description,"i have a 3ib.8oz. yorkie,who doesnt like his feet wet.ordered these.in xsmall after reading review. boots were everything they said,just failed to tell a tight rubber band wouldnt even help stay on.his feet are so narrow,they would have to be xxxsmall,were of good value,except for size."
2,Funny but not very useful,"I bought these knowing my dog would probably not like them, but that a) if he did end up liking them, we could be saved some muddy tracks and cold paws and b) if he hated them, we might at least get some cute pictures of him with booties on. He did hate them, and they fell off before we could snap a picture.There's no elastic in this material and it's very thick and stiff, so it was difficult to get them on him securely. We did our best to wrap the Velcro band around them well enough that they'd stay on, but the material just bunched up a lot in the back. Because they bunched up so much, snow and water could easily get in through the top.They lasted about 2 seconds on my dog and as soon as he jumped up, they slipped right off. In my opinion, it wasn't worth the money for something he'll never use again."
5,Fashion Pet Waterproof Boots,Boots are just as described but I wish I was able to get them in a smaller size as they are a bit too big for my Maltese. XSML would have worked better.
4,Not to Shabby,"I think Dafydd Ab Hugh did a pretty good job wrapping up the sereis. There was a time in the begining that it was a little boring, but a lot of books do that. Kamala would have you believe it is the worst book in the series, but it is not. It is also not the best, but it most definately is not the worst. Go ahead and read it. It has some really interesting stuff I think you might enjoy"
1,should I even have bothered,"I tried to read this book, I really did but please Daffyd you could really do more with this book. I have had trouble reading other books before but I am a pretty open person and usually manage to finish them. However I couldn't even get halfway through this book, it was that terrible. Still, everyone is different, don't let my silly ramblings, dissuade you from buying this book you may like it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
3,Good start.....,"This is a pretty good book, and I think any Voyager fan should read it. But it was also rather disappointing. The beggining was promising- it was creepy and psycological.....And then the author kind of drops that aspect and goes all action. B'Elanna is a bit too moody, and Neelix is....well, a bit too handy. But all in all it's worth the bad scenes it may have."
3,Not the best of the invasion books,"This book was okay, however it did not really do justice to the other invasion books. First of all, the author makes too many mistakes,about the characters( he also did this in 'Vengeance'), secondly this books gets too tedious too read after a while, especially when B'Elanna and Redbay go on the moons' surface. After reading first strike, soldiers of fear and Times enemy, this book was slightly disappointing. However it was not all bad, I certainly like the part where Tuvok, janeway and neelix are in the fury cell, and neelix is lecturing them about starfleet effciency. On the whole, it was okay."
1,It is the WORST book in the Invasion series!!!,"I agree witt Kamala222. The characters are out of place, and some of the things that the crew does and some of the thing that happen to the ship just would not happen. B'Elanna Torres was not used to the equipment on the ship. If she was not used to the equipment then why was she made Chief Engineer!!! This guy needs to understand Star Trek before he begins to write about it. Especially the final book in the Invasion series. If you are a TRUE Star Trek fan you will not get this book. It stincks!!!!!!!!"
1,Worst Writing I Have Ever Read,"How does someone who writes this poorly even get a book contract? Even if you ignore the mishandled characters and plain old silliness, this book is terrible. The third grade writing style makes it almost impossible to hammer your way through it. I also hope you like exclamation points because the author makes the judicious use of them that a 12 year old girl writing a love note would. This book is very disappointing considering how serviceable the first three in the series were. The third one I would even call a great Star Trek book. Oh well."
4,Great for babies and toddlers,My daughter loves this toy and so do we! We also enjoyed the fact that it played music from Peter and the Wolf. This is a great toy that I would definitely recommend!!!!!
3,"Enormous, Heavy, Cumbersome Operation","This thing is a monster. No infant can operate it (as some reviewers indicate). The music quality is excellent, though the modes are nothing special. One is continuous play and the other is basically abreviated play, and a touch will cause continuation. It certainly doesn't teach any lessons (other than ""touching this will make it play a nice song"").This could have been done much more smoothly. OH well, $10, free shipping and a lesson learned."
5,My son loved this toy when he was younger,It was bright and he enjoyed watching the lights move and the music is excellent with very rich tones. We had this in his crib and he loved it. He now at 16 mos has found a new use for this toy. He puts it on the floor and since we have it set to the motion feature he runs all around it making it go off all day long.
5,our favorite,"My 10 month old got the Sunshine Symphony when she was 4 months old and she still loves it. It has a velcro strap that we hook on to her stroller and she is so content listening to her music. My friends 2 year old loves it to, she often tries to take it off our stroller. This is a most for all new moms."
4,Mom of twins,"We loved this toy when we first got it. My infants were fascinated by the lights and the music was a wonderful relief from some of the other twangy toys we had. It actually soothed my baby boy to sleep when he was battling reflux disease. We were thrilled. Unfortunately, this toy died within two months of our purchasing it. The computer croaked and was beyond repair or new batteries. Now this wonderful colorful toy sits in the toy box untouched. Wish it had been a lot more durable than it was."
3,"Nice Music, not much on activities","My baby loves the beautiful classicial music this plays, but there isn't much that she can do with it. She doesn't find it all that interesting, and it is a little heavy for her to pick up. It's really become a music box, which is nice in itself, but not quite all the adverts make it out to be."
3,OK but kind of boring,"I fully agree with Mr. G.:The music quality is excellent, though the modes are nothing special. One is continuous play and the other is basically abreviated play, and a touch will cause continuation. Another cause-effect toy.It is also too sensitive. Walking across the room sets it off.Certainly not worth list price but at a discount its an ok toy."
1,Neurosmith out of business,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She actually got to listen to the music once. It just won't play music more than one time on a set of batteries. It will play and then all the lights get stuck on. I contacted Neurosmith (don't even bother with the phone number...use email). I was told that they were going out of business, and they couldn't help me. They said to contact the store I got it from. Well, they had closed too (Discovery Store). So, I have a $40 teething toy that to be honest, she would rather play with anything else. This toy was a waste!"
1,A waste of money and a piece of junk,"I bought this for my son based on the glowing reviews hereit was a mistake. My son wouldnt play with this toy and ignored it for the most part unless I place the toy into his hands or gently place a flap in his mouth so he can bite on it. I wouldnt buy it if it was on sale for 1 dollar.The music quality is very good however because of the very few notes it gets quickly annoying. Imagine trying to hear one note from Mozart however great, over and over and over againThe unit would hangup numerous times, and I have to do a manual reset for it to start again. Save yourself some money and get something else."
5,Worth The Penny,"If you like (neo) soul, hip hop, R&B, and even house, then you're sure to enjoy listening to this ablum. Not surprisingly, it also has a little bit of the Latin vibe to it (especially when the horns kick in). Definitely worth the penny."
1,Hypnosis Stess Relief,CD and the replacement CD were both defective - no sound. Tried them on 3 different CD players and not one sound.
1,"Unorganized, Obvious, and Ignorant","The author of this book doesn't even realize how poorly written this book really is. It is so unorganized, and makes so many references to so many different people that i loose grasp of what the heck she is trying to talk about. And talk about the most ignorant person in the world!! How can a full grown teacher NOT have ever heard of Kwanzaa? How could she not know that Young blacks use the ""N"" word with one another? I mean come on, this author has been living in a bubble and the stuff she discovers is nothing beyond what everyone knows already."
4,This book is an amazing catalyst for discussions.,"I am a college student and read this book for an education class. To be honest I was less than impressed as I began reading it, but it held me rivited to find out what would come next. My feelings about the book as a whole changed at the conclusion when I realized the author wasn't trying to answer the questions of race and intergration, rather, she was giving us an opportunity to discuss it. Even in my group, which read and gave a presentation on the book, we found ourselves talking at length about racial and religious issues. I was impressed."
3,Kwanzaa,"Even though the content of this book is relevent and to the point of multiculturalism in our schools and society today, the book is written more for a child than an adult and becomes tedious halfway through. Ms. Paley needs to hire a writer to convey her messages!"
5,Great companion...,"along with ""The Master Game"". His primary work is a must read, and this book fills out the influences and some information of the people that shaped his thought. This book serves as a good example of one ""walking the walk"", and from one that has much worth listening to. For anyone needing a ""guide"", his works make the journey so much more comprehensible and understandable."
3,Poor documentation but experiment produced results,"Though my digital camera provides for composite connections and the Hauppauge appears to provide them, connecting them provided only the picture and no sound. Searching through the provided documentation did little good either. The documentation attempts to cover several versions of the board and it is not very clear on how to connect for sound for my particular version. Finally, with some experimentation, I was able to connect the sound to the input of my sound card and use the Hauppauge for video only. That works but seemed counterintuitive to the connectors provided on the card. After some hours experimenting, I was able to capture video and sound together but it was a frustrating process. The end was good but it was a bit of a struggle and I am still not confident the method I found is the ""correct"" method to connect my camera. Documentation is my primary concern - the board itself seems to do a fine job of video capture."
3,Lacks TV Software to make it work!,"The Hauppaugge WinTV Card looked fine and installed fine but came without TV software. Of course the software is avalable from other sources like special versions of Vista. But since I was running XP pro that didn't help. It would have been helpful to know this up front.The Ati TV Wonder card I bought a couple of years ago came with TV software so this was a disappointment. But the good part was, I was able to return it to Amazon and receive a full refund. Thanks for making that part work so well. You will keep us buying at Amazon.And maybe someday I will buy the Hauppauge WinTV card again when I am running a computer system that has Microsoft's TV program in it.thanks for asking,dean"
4,Great Costume for the price,My 4 year old wanted to be a kitty cat for Halloween this year and chose this costume. It is pretty decent. Decently made. It will last a while for play whenever she wants to dress up. The ears are a bit low quality though. Feels like the ears are made of thin felt but they work. I just wish it came with a tail. Had to buy one separately. In all it is a good costume for the price. You can't see it in the pictures but this costume has sparkly dots all over.
4,Great for the price,"The charger itself seemed a little cheap but it works... It will fully charge the BN-VF707, and the BN-VF714. The only problem I had with it was that a BN-VF733 that i had purchased from Mercury Innovations will not fully charge on this charger.. It will only fully charge when charging through the camcorder itself. .. It also has a car adapter which is very convenient"
5,"Not the original VAs, but still a nice selection of music.","I saw this show back in Dec. 2000 and I was very impressed how they turned the cartoon into a live-action show. Unfortunately, the voice actors we know and love from the anime are not here, with the exceptions of Meowth and Pikachu. There are some great new songs (never heard on TV) on this CD, most of which tie directly into the plot. I think my favorite track is #2, ""It Will All Be Mine"", sung by the Team Rocket leader, Giovanni! This is a great choice if you like Pokemon but don't think you can listen to 2BA Master one more time...I hope someday a video/DVD version of the stage show is released. But until then, just enjoy this great CD!For more information about the show, you can visit my synopsis at http://www.dazzled.com/trsrockin/script.html. ^_^"
1,THIS IS NOT A SET!,"If you are rushing and did what I did, you will look at the photo, and then miss the description which says ""fitted"". Imagine my surprise when expecting a set and receiving a single sheet. Not that great a sheet for $47. Would have been ""o.k."" if it was a set. Still, cheaper to buy nice set of white sheets at TJ Max or Ross. Just didn't have time. Now, will make time to go there and also P.O. to return this one. Oye!"
5,Modern Hausa-English Dictionary,"Modern Hausa-English Dictionary is a very good publication with apparently, no major defects noted that I have observe at this very point!"
4,Even if you don't hate vegetables...,I just bought this book because so many of the recipes looked great and didn't required running out buying all kinds of other ingredients. I'll get back to you on how the recipes turn out but they sound wonderful. Makes me want to start cooking right away.
4,Maple??,I have a worked with a lot of woods but have never seen maple like this. Looks nothing like my other maple board and is much lighter with bigger growth rings. You will need to wax this board or oil your self up. Surface if far from being friction free.BUT for the money this is a very good buy and those other plastic coated boards are NOT any closer to being friction free.
1,R U Serious,"The person that buys this video from this d-bag , Needs a swift roundhouse kick to the head. Give me 29.97 and I will kick you in the privates , it will feel a lot better than having to watch this tape."
2,lacking,"This video has some good points nad bad points. Mr.Hoban is fluid in his techniques but he is lacking in the natural power that can be derived from taijutsu. Plus his ihan no kamae is off kilter with his butt sticking out instead of behind him. Anyways view it for yourself, if it is all that you have then it will have to do."
3,Good for the family,The movie itself is good for the family but the plot is pretty dry and the acting is so so. Still for a $2 rental it is not a total loss.
3,This is not an authentic Wusthof.,"It works just fine as a sharpening steel, but it is NOT a Wusthof brand steel. First indicator is that the rod did not come in a box; rather, just had a slip of cardboard over the steel to protect it. The cardboard had ""Made In Germany"" and said it was a Wusthof, but...main indicator this was not legit is that the red ""W"" logo that is emblazoned on all Wusthof products (usually on the handle) was IMITATED with a red ""W"" sticker. Dude. The sharpening rod works well and does the job overall, but obviously I feel victim to false advertising in the product not being the brand I believed it to be. Beware."
4,I Like it,"its a fair price, right weight, the wusthof label did not last too long on the handel, beside that I think its ok."
5,"Easy, Enjoyable, and Entertaining Read!!!","I love this kind of hero. He is an ass, but not to his lady. I read the book in a day, and it went very fast. I thought it was entertaining and fun. This has to be a new Kleypas favorite! Highly recommend!"
4,liked it better than other books,"it was better than dreaming of you and it held my attention ,,well i read it yesterday and i do not remember exactly how it ended but the sexual tention and the sex scenes are great."
4,the charmer and the socially inept,"I awaited this book with bated breath. Although Lisa Kleypas did not disappoint, I do believe I let my imagination carry me off in an entirely different direction to what she portrayed. I was hoping for a FAR more devilish hero, one that I would love to hate, but with whom I would eventually fall in love (at the same time as the heroine, naturally). I awaited internal conflicts between the pair, rather than those of an external variety. The Sebastian of my imagination and the Sebastian of the story were two different souls.Evie was reserved, shy and beautiful, with an immeasurable depth of empathy and caring for others. Sebastian (not the wicked rake of my dreams), the fallen Angel, was jaded but rather easily affected by Evie.Despite my expectations for something else entirely, I still found myself enjoying both hero and heroine immensely. They meshed well, and played off of one another beautifully."
5,WallFlowers!!!!!!!,"JUST LOVE THOSE WALLFLOWERS......THE SERIES JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. IF YOUR KNEW TO LISA KLEYPAS' NOVELS, DON'T MISS THIS ONE, BUT START WITH ""DREAMING OF YOU"". SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET THE LAST ONE PUBLISHED ASAP CO'Z I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO DAISY WILL END UP WITH.....2 THUMBS UP FOR CAM!!!!!!!!"
4,A fresh turn for a traditional setup,"This romantic pairing -- the shy wallflower and the irredeemable rake -- is traditional in historical romance, but Kleypas manages to make it fresh and have her characters stand out from the crowd. Evie's home life is so horrid that one can understand why she'd approach Sebastian with her proposition (and one can even understand, if not condone, why her family might treat her that way). Sebastian has more of a transformation over the course of the novel than does Evie, but it seems a reasonable one, as his restless energy finds an outlet and a focus. With only one book in Kleypas' ""Wallflower"" series left to go, I'm eager to see what happens next."
2,"A quick read, but not that good","Evie Jenner is about to come into a lot of money. The only problem is that her relatives a terrible lot that would not care if she was death. Sebastain, Lord St. Vincent as a title, a known rake and very little money. So Evie thinks that marriage is a idea that will help both of them. But there are still dangers out there that could mean the end of these two.""Devil is Winter"" is the third book in the ""Wallflowers"" series by Lisa Kleypas. I am going to from the start that I read book one last, didn't finish book to all, but with book still on my bookshelf gathering dust I thought that it was time to read and get out my way. It was an ok read, but I thought there wasn't really much drama in the book and the characters were not the interesting. This doesn't give much hope for book four, which I have to still read. Overall while some people seem to loved this book and series I was not one of them"
1,Disappointed,After reading book 1 & 2 in the series I was really disappointed in the lack of believability in the story. Couldn't quite buy the way the two mains end up. Which is sad because I really wanted to like this book.
1,I was bored,The beginning of this story was great...I loved the storyline and it kept me entertained but somewhere in the middle it got really boring and predictable. I didn't finish reading it.
2,Disappointing,"I have quite a few of Kleypas's books but after reading the last two I am becoming less of a fan. The first ""Wallflower"" series books was definitely the best of the bunch. My main gripe with the book is that there is no sexual tension, no teasing buildup to the big love scene. Evie and Sebastian elope and do the deed within the first 4 chapters.Additionally, the backstory is a re-tread of the gambling house from Dreaming of You - a much better book.Worth a read only if you are a Kleypas fan and you get it from the library."
4,The title misleads,"The title of this book is misleading. Sebastian is never a devil. From the get-go, he is a great guy. He takes care of Evie, he is nice to her father, he just is an all-around great guy. I was disappointed. I wanted to see him change and become good. But, we don't see that. He never really is a devil and I was disappointed. LK can write really good heroes and Sebastian is one, but he was never a devil. The man she did get right in this book was Cam Rohan. I would have liked to have read more about him. The author would be wise to make Cam the hero of her next book. And, maybe he could be a little more devilish!"
4,One of the best but...,"I reread this book as well as two others in the Walflower series and finishing the Hawthorne series. I have one question. Was Lisa planning to have Daisy and Cam end up together and then changed her mind? An otherwise fine romance novel has a superfluous scene, a sort of tease when in later books nothing comes of it. The romance genre doesn't do well with loose ends that aren't at least tied up in a subsequent book. I will reread Daisy's story to find out. In the meantime this is still a very touching book, albeit the cliches."
4,Ok,"I thought this book was ok for many reasons:1)I like the fact that Evie actually came from the loins of Jenner, a character in one of Ms. Kleypas books. Now Jenner was not our main hero in that book and he wasn't very likable either. In fact, I was wary of him until the end but I just thought it different that a heroine was coming from him.2)The whole story was totally unexpected because Evie was someone who was lacking in confidence and didn't strike anyone as someone who would be bold enough to propose a marriage convenience with the villain.3)I also like the fact that despite what St. Vincent did to Lilian, Evie did not let that deter her.All in all good book. Not my favorite of all the books, but good."
5,"Wonderful, Excellent Book, LOVED it!!","Oh my gosh, this book was amazing! I found it on the same page as Derek Craven's story (Dreaming of You) and I seriously did not think it would be possible for me to love a book just as much! I adored Evie and Sebastian was such a wonderful character. I had just finished ""It Happened one Autumn"" and could not wait to read about Sebastian and Evie. I didn't hate him at all for what he did at the end of ""Autumn""--he had his back up against the wall. Anyhow, back to this book, I loved how he took control of the gaming house and started to work. And Evie! So glad she came out of her shell and matched him pound for pound--she was no wallflower. It was great seeing this story unfold and all the little sweet things Sebastian did were so swoon worthy (such as the brick and how he wore the ring!). I especially loved it when Evie told him he was going to lose the wager. Read this book and you will not be disappointed. I totally loved it :)"
5,my favorite,"this is by far my favorite of the four ""wallflower"" books! though they are all great -- I love the ""dark hero."""
4,"forward thinking in some ways, cliched in others....","This 3rd installment into the ""wallflower"" quartet of books was the one I was looking forward to the most. Evie was a sympathetic, loving character since book one. The premise of setting her up with the throughly disreputable Sebastian was an interesting concept.While the book was largely very well written, the bed scenes scorching hot, and the characters interesting-there were too many heavily used and cliched romance plots to make this book a five star. The ending with the villain was way too predictable, as was Sebastians response to the villainy at the end.That being said- there's enough ""perfect"" scenes that I would still recommend this book to any fan of highly sensual and dramatic romantic adventure.4.5 stars..."
5,My favorite all time and of the wallflowers.,I love this one I like the others series but wow . He one naughty lord hehe. She so shy and pretty girl and small he so big and tough and handsome I love how he teasing her and how she gives it right back at him.Thanks for writing these books your my favorite writer Mrs. Lisa Kleypas your wonderful. I love the wallflower Christmas one to great job also the all the hatchways series to great books
5,Astonishing!,"It's rare to find a writer who can take you into a world and make you feel such powerful emotions over a story. I couldn't wait to get this book. From the moment it arrived in the mail, I consumed it in one night. This book was beyond your typical romance novel. It was funny, exciting, suspenseful, heartwarming. I actually had tears well up and that NEVER happens to me. The scandalous St. Vincent finally meets his match the lovely Evie. And to see him slowly care for someone other than himself, really stirred something inside of me. Buy the book, you won't be disappointed.Looking for other good books? Check out my other recommendations."
4,"Enjoyable, sexy","Enjoyable romance. Well written, enjoyable characters, and story. Not very believable for the last third, once they return to London. Too much sex for my taste."
5,I just love this book!!,I am a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas and I especially love how she uses past characters to make a story so rich and full! This book is a definite buy and read over and over!! St. Vincent is sooooooo sexy!! Make sure to add this book to your collection!
4,A Cute Tale!,"DEVIL IN WINTER is a sweet tale of one of four young ladies looking for marriage and security. EVANGELINE JENNER'S story is the third in a series of four novels detailing the desires of four young women seeking security and hopefully love during the early 1800's English marriage market.DEVIL IN WINTER is well written, but not as sizzling as her novel, SUDDENLY YOU, but is well worth your time. Begin with SECRETS OF A SUMMER NIGHT and follow up with IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUM, DEVIL IN WINTER and soon-to-be-released SCANDAL IN SPRING. Ms. Kleypas never disappoints her readers!"
4,"Better of the ""Seasons"" Series so far...","Of the ""seasons"" series, this is one of Kleypas' better writings. As a previous reviewer indicated, you do end up caring for the characters and it was hard to put the book down. I did put it down just to make it last a bit longer!!"
4,Four Stars ONLY becuase St. Vincent is so HOT!,"I read this book from cover to cover within one day. I was just sorry that Kleypas turned him into a politically correct sniveling whipped jelly of a man! My gosh..when Evie told him that he would have to be celibate I actually WANTED him to go out and have an affair or at least goad her.In the last book, he was so strong and actually said the longest he had ever went without sex was one week, how the heck does he turn into this whipped man within a day??!! I wanted him to be a little more resistent to Evie and I would have liked to read more about her family.Therefore, this book gets four stars instead of five because while the love scenes were hot...there were not enough (only because St. Vincent is supposed to be sensual) and also because I would have loved a little more character development. It just felt a little to rushed...like Kleypas was in a hurry to write this on a deadline or was only allowed to write the book at a certain length."
2,Not so wild about this Wallflower Book #3,"Unfortunately, I could not get past Lord St. Vincent's previous vile acts. I find it far fetched and unbelievable that Lord St. Vincent would change so radically after falling in love with Evie. A leopard can not change his spots so quickly! I still enjoy the series but was disappointed by this particular love story."
5,Loved It!,Loved this story of all the wildflower series this is my favorite. I love the development of the relationship of the hero/heroine. I loved how the hero develops and cares for the herione.
4,One of my new favorites,"This was my first Lisa Kleypas book and I must say, I really really love her style. I loved the characters, I liked the plot line, I liked that there was no boring background that didn't add anything to the story, and the tender moments between them were great. Sebastian was adorable and I found myself rooting for him, which is not always the case in these books. All in all, I'm pretty picky about romance books and I havn't found too many that I really truly enjoyed, but this one I did. I don't give out five stars unless the book makes it on my keeper shelf and I feel like telling my friends about it, but this one is definitely worth reading and was a fun little afternoon escape, which is what a romance novel should be."
5,I WANT ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT THEM!,"This is my favorite book by her. The characters are so well suited. I totally believed the unfolding of the relationship. I loved her quiet strength, and I loved Sebastian slowly falling in love with her against his will. They complimented each other so well. I really would love to read another book about them. Maybe they could be drawn into an adventure or mystery? All I know is that I can't get enough."
5,Fun workout,"I don't normally write reviews, but I just have to say I really enjoyed this video. I like the fact that there's cardio, strength, and core work all in one workout. I also like the fact that I can choose to do any of the sections by themself too if I'm short on time or would like to combine it with something else. I hope that Sarah makes more DVDs. It's nice to have a different face to look at when exercising (besides the regular instructors)."
3,mmmm....,"Well i have to tell you that this workout contains a great background scenario and honestly this workout is good for when you don't want to do high impact exercise and want to workout anyway,it makes sweat and gives you a good core workout,you can choose your own workouts when you are short in time.she is a very gentle instructor,not JILLIAN MICHAELS TYPE!!!"
1,Horrible Stuff,"Horrible product. It leaves lint like residue from the applicator that dries to a hard finish. Yes, it can be removed readily with the cleaner, but the applicator leaves thin-threads on the lenses with every application. Don't buy this product."
4,Lens Doctor,"I like the product, it works like it's advertized. I think the key is the way that you apply the solution to the lens but, if you don't get it right the first time the cleaner takes the solution right off so that you can try again. If you work with it I think you will e happy with the results."
2,Review,This item did not work for me. It left my glasses foggy and blurred! I had to use alcohol to remve residue so that I could see through my glasses again!
1,Don't Buy,This product does not work. It left streaks on my glasses plus it did not come off with the cleaner so it has messed up an expensive set of glasses. Don't waste your time with this product. You will just waste your money and not like the results.
3,Warning - minimalist production,"Wonderful story, fabulous opera, great orchestra, superb Romeo and Juliette, and wonderful supporting cast and costumes fine. But all action takes place on a Dias with probably a couple hundred dollars in props. Minimally we need a balcony and a crypt. What a shame --- this is Romeo and Juliette. We are not transported to the Renaissance....we are stuck on a dingy stage in Salzburg. Time to try the ROH production."
2,flimsy,"This is the 3rd Wildkins lunchbox I've purchased and the first one I've been disappointed in. It's very cute but it has no real shape. When my daughter picks it up, it just sags like a shapeless bag and does not stand up in the space at school where she needs to store it. Even worse, if I put the largest cold pack I can fit in the provided slot, it is melted by lunch-time and her food is only slightly cool; that's less than 3 hours.I do not recommend this lunch box - sorry."
3,"Very polished ensemble, but lacks real power...","This is a very good jazz band. They exhibit some exceptional solos and are real tight on average. Their trumpets, however, are just too weak. They cut out time and time again and generally sound very subdued. Being from Iowa, I get a chance to listen to all the big name college jazz bands in the state, namely UNI, Drake and the University of Iowa. Take the raw power and sound of Drake's trumpets, mix that with the precision and cleanliness of UNI and you got yourself and very professional-sounding band."
4,Finally a female author...,"who isn't just out to bash men. Refreshing change, don't you think? A female prosecutor helps her to male police detective friends solve a murder on Broadway. Decent story, some of the dialogue is repeative, but it isn't bad."
1,yech,"I read this book after running in Central Park and just couldn't stomach the vacuity and incredibility that is Alexandra Cooper. Back to Poirot and Agatha Christie. There were two good sleuths: honest, tidy and intelligent."
1,Absolutely Horrible. A must NOT read,"This book was so horrible and poorly written that it took me over 3 months to complete reading it. I couldnt get into the book because there was to much useless information not even pertaining to the plot and the characters were all one dimensional. I had to force myself to read a few pages a night,after the first few nights I realized that this is something you should read if you have difficulty falling asleep because its a very boring book.I dont reccomend this book to anyone."
2,Disappointing,"The plot line intitially piqued my interest when I settled in for an interesting thriller with a theatrical backdrop. What I got was a flat, poorly written thriller ""wanna-be."" The characters were uninteresting and all written in the same voice...much of the dialogue did not ring true to the character speaking it. I kept reading in hopes it would improve, but it did not. It is clear that Ms. Fairstein knows the law and the city, unfortunately that knowledge does not translate into a well written book."
3,These are getting to be ho-hum stories,"This is another in the Alexandra Cooper series. Alex, as we all know, is the Assistant DA in the Sex Crimes Unit of the NYPD and, of course, continues to work with police detectives Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace. The main plot of this story is the death of a prima ballerina at the Met. Assorted sub-plots fill the pages.Unfortunately, these stories are all pretty much the same now - Alex gets in perilous situations she may not get out of; the threesome still bet $20 on the final Jeopardy question; there's some NY history lesson (this time it's the theater industry); and there's always some unanswered question (fuel for the next book?)."
4,Plot drags,"The trio of Alexandra Cooper,Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace return in a murder mystery set in New York's theater district. Lots of interesting trivia about New York theater and history of the Shriners. The plot drags on and doesn't quite gell. As someone else remarked, the ending is prolonged and not quite believable. Not as good as Fairstein's ""Entombed."""
3,Death Dance,Not as exciting as Alex Cooper mysteries usually are. Too much droning on about nothing and very difficult to stay with. I usually read a book within a week but I can't stay with this because it puts me to sleep. Keep hoping it will get better . Not one of Linda Fairstein's better works.I would not recommend it.
2,More like assigned reading,"How can I fairly judge Death Dance? Though I once read only mystery books, it is rare now that I read a mystery. Last year, out of the 158 books that I read, only two were mysteries.So what would make me, a rare mystery reader, pick up this book? The same things that would make me pick up any book. I look for characters that interest me and a story that is compelling. The blurb on the back offers up the story in a way that appeals to me; I was intrigued by the idea of dancers. That's enough for me to pick up the book, but it's not enough to keep me reading. To keep me in the book, the author has to surprise me. Death Dance did not surprise me. I forced myself to read through the book, but it felt more like assigned reading than pleasure."
5,Love my coffee,"I have used the same grinder for fourteen years. When it wore out, Ifoundthe same grinder at Amazon for the best price."
2,SADLY DISSAPPOINTING,"I PUCHASED THE LA PAVONI GRINDER ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, TRULY THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE THE LAST GRINDER I EVER NEEDED. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WELL MADE AND FOR PROFESSIONAL USE, SO I FIGURED THAT USING IT ONCE A DAY WOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE, AND I WAS WILLING TO SPEND THE BIG BUCKS FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD LAST.AFTER MY CAPRESSO BURR GRINDER EXPERIENCE, I REALLY WANTED A STURDY QUALITY MACHINE. WELL, AFTER HALF A YEAR OF USE, THE GRINDER BURR IS COMPLETELY WORN OUT, AND WOULDN'T GRIND MY FINGER IF I STUCK THAT IN IT, AND, NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIND THE PARTS TO FIX IT, AND IF THEY COULD IT WOULD COST ME [MONEY]. AREVADERCI LA PAVONI!! OH AND BYE BYE [MONEY], WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK."
3,good price for good grinder,"I spend about 100 dollars tax included to get this beautiful grinder.It's the lowest price I saw, and this grinder really do his job.I am using the stovetop coffee maker, which this product can handle easily.Now I can enjoy my fresh coffee everyday.PS. I really hate USPS package service, and that make my experience for shopping this grinder become 3 stars from 4 stars."
1,Disappointed,"I would be returning this item except for the fact that I received it free with another purchase. Even though it has not been soaked in water but only rinsed and dried, it has warped to the point you can't use it because it wobbles so and has split in several places."
1,Incorrectly described,"I wish I'd read the previous reviews! I ordered this for $14.99 as a ""bottom of the page special"" and it's going back. It is not two inches thick as described, but 3/4"". What a disappointment! And now I see that the regular price has been changed from $25 to $40. YIKES! Don't bother..."
1,Useless - unworthy of the Wusthof name,"I purchased this board with a set of Wüsthof knives. The knives were excellent - I have since purchased more - but the board was a disaster. It warped almost immediately - hardly surprising perhaps as it is thin. Quite possibly I did not care for it properly, for example by oiling it or whatever, but then again there were no instructions included relating to any necessity for that sort of treatment.I would by a butcher's block in future, rather than one of these things. As a general chopping platform I would suggest going for a good quality plastic board, as it will not dull your knives nor be a pain to look after."
1,Glad it was free,"I am on my second one of these, which I received free with the purchase of Wusthof knives. The first started to separate after only one week of use. Don't buy it."
1,junk!,I love my Wusthof knives so I was surprised when this board started splitting on me and has continued to since... what a disappointment. stay away from this board
1,Glad it was free,I am on my second one of these which I received free with the purchase of Wusthof knives. The first started to separate after only one week of use. Don't buy it.
4,Good basic approach,"I own the 1997 edition and although this ""Practical"" IT auditing guide is dated, in terms of where Information Systems vulnerabilities exist in today's Network Centric-Web Enabled environment, there are some good audit plans, explanations of basic concepts and useful frameworks.The book is really short on identifying current risks or audits for databases, info security vulnerabilities and germane discussions on enterprise wide deployments of ERPs.It does have an annual supplemental (which I don't have to review) which if done appropriately would greatly enhance it above a basic internal controls approach to auditing IT.I refer to it when reviewing my audit plans to ensure I don't miss the basics."
5,A beautiful FERRARI of espresso,"Since i got la Pavoni Europiccola my life changed for good,after a hard day at work, i can't wait to go home to make a super Cappuccino,this machine makes the best cappuccino in the world, not like those cheapChinese or north European imitations, unless you like watery pseudo coffee.The Italians invented the cappuccino and the espresso coffee, they know all tricks anddetails on how to build machines that produce the best results.Not to mention the style, La Pavoni is the most beautiful piece of art in my kitchen,and it is also very well built,in other words La Pavoni is the Ferrari of the coffee machines.Don't waste your money buying other coffee machines, this one is the BEST.If you like good coffee, you will love this coffee maker."
5,Track Listing:,"Someday Sweetheart,Mary,So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together,I Surrender Dear,Where the Blue of the Night,Please,Thanks,The Last Round-Up,St. Louis Blues,Black Moonlight,Beautiful Girl,We'll Make Hay While the Sun Shines,Temptation,Did You Ever See a Dream Walking,She Reminds Me of You,Love in Bloom"
1,Terrible,"I really tried. The premise interested me - Queen Elizabeth's court - someone terrorizing the queen - the appearance of dead a dead body in her private garden -a mystery waiting to be solved.At page 164 I gave up and this one is in the donation box.The story involved a load of uninteresting characters - most especially Meg or Sarah or whatever each character wanted to call her. I new the answer to the mystery after the introduction of characters in the first few pages. Why it took the author 350 pages to tell this tale is simple...poor writing.She tried to string you along with a variety of likely criminals, but the story was just too obvious - and all that happened subsequently was just too boring and/or totally unbelievable. If you want a good mystery - this is not it.If you want a good historical fiction - this is not it. I would suggest something by Sharan Kay Penman or Rosalyn Miles if you want this era."
1,God Bless Queen Bess and her Evidence-Hating Quacks,"The Queene's Cure is where Karen Harper loses me and possibly many of her readers. The premise of this entire book is that Doctors are Uncaring, Evil Monsters, while Quacks are Good and Wise and Better than Doctors And Care, Oh So Much, About Everyone.Give it up, Karen Harper. You can turn doctors into devils and quacks into saints, but herbalists and other quacks are still to a person without exception evil, conniving conmen whose ""wisdom"" extends only to knowing how to steal thousands of dollars from their deluded, sick, unhappy victims whom they pretend to care for, smirking up their sleeves all the while, while at the same time braying about how ""greedy"" doctors are. Nothing you can write will change that, and especially not a novel about Elizabeth I!The plot is hardly worth mentioning given the audacious anti-science and anti-evidence mentality of the writer.This book is not even worth pulping, it's so bad."
5,A heart-wrenching novel of two couples during the Holocaust,"The incredibly written account of two couples that survived the trecherous Holocaust to marry and then move to America. The story starts out with all four young adults facing many normal issues until they are faced with prejudices and then changing of the system. When the Nazis take over they are all over whelmed and their lives are forever changed. The novel takes you through everyone's lives as their live through the Holocaust and survive to tell their story. I think that this is the best book that has ever been written about the Holocaust and it so beautifully done that you have to stop and catch your breath at the end. In the end, you feel love and you feel sympathy to the two couples who had to endure such pain. I loved this book and I will read it over and over because it is such a classic."
5,This is my city.,"This is my Los Angeles. The one I see when I walk around on streets, staring at things. The one I try to capture with every piece of fiction I write. This is it.So many portrayals of Los Angeles, whether fictional, nonfictional, or photographical, take all the wrong parts of California cliche and try to call it LA. Look, here are some movie stars. Look, here are some bored rich kids. Look, here's the 'underbelly of Hollywood', whatever that means.Paul Jasmin gets it right. The dirty pretty people wearing leather. The graffiti, the cigarettes, the lounging around, the leopard print. One of my favourite images features a scruffy, aging writer at his laptop, surrounded by books and wearing a shirt that says 'When we were punk'. It's so far from any travel guide with the Hollywood sign on the front. I just want to cheer, //Here it is. This is it. This is my Los Angeles.//"
4,Lost Angeles :),This photography book is a great start for anybody who is interested in photography. I admit I loved the portraits. A book of people for the people :)
5,Great jazz-fusionesque Drum'n'Bass,"Hanna is obviously a musician and a connoiseur due to the fact that his songs are very well put together, and the jazz element does not suffer from over trite chords. And the rhythms are tight as hell.This CD has an impressive creative side to it and 'Aftermath'is how Teck beats meets Jazz-Fusion without suffering from lack of musical knowledge. Impressive song!!Excellent job Hanna! Keep this quality of work up. This one is my favorite of your collection."
2,Disappointing,"This knife block shouldn't have Wustof's name on it because the difference between the quality of this product and the quality of their knives (which are outstanding) is huge. Besides looking cheap, once it is loaded up, it wants to tip forward quite easily. That's not something you want to have happen when you've got a very sharp knife in your hand. If you flinch, start, jump, or whatever you could hurt yourself. I'm going to re-position the feet on the bottom to see if that will help. If not, I'll have to add additional support. Disappointing."
2,CheaplyMade,"I wanted to get a ""compact"" knife block for the Wusthof knives that I purchased and thought that this would fill the bill because I only have a few knives. As one review said, it probably would not be very stable if it was filled with knives.Well the first thing that I noticed was it missing one of the rubber feet on the bottom and would tip over easily so I returned it hesitatingly to Amazon for a replacement.I say hesitatingly because the quality of the wood and workmanship is not up to the Wusthof knives that it's supposed to hold. It's made with ""slapped together"" veneers and it is not even sanded smooth on all sides. I haven't decided if I'll keep the replacement if it's of similar poor quality."
3,so-so,"I like this okay, but the quality is lacking - after a few months, the wood cracked. It still works, but not worth the money."
5,great book for beginners,I had never created an active server page before. My Web site had over a dozen after my first weekend with the book. The lessons make the process very easy!
2,THE SAND/WATER WHEEL DOESN'T WORK,"One of the main reasons I bought this set was because it included a sand/water wheel. However, the weight of a full shovel full of sand or water will not turn the wheel. And there is no crank to turn it. It has to be turned manually. No fun."
3,Feast Yer Ears,"Feast Yer Ears...This has been hard to find stateside, just ask Chuck! While Prophet is riding high this year and playing the late night talk show circuit, new fans will want to dig out his older releases. There are glimmers of greatness in the grooves of many of the songs on Feast of Hearts, and fans should definitely check out ""Hungry Town"" and ""What It Takes"". ""Longshot Lullaby"" is a classic emotion filled number that ruled his live shows for a longtime, while the muted ""Let's Burn This Firetrap Down"" recounts some wasted daze and knights at a long lost local SF watering hole. This release was produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and was made during a transitional mid 90's period for Prophet. The production was a bit too tame/mainstream for my tastes, but deserves to be heard. If you don't want to spend a fortune on a disc, the mp3 version is up at eMusic."
3,Buy it for 'Worlds Collide',"This ""Part Two"" CD single of ""Promises"" can be summed up fast: Buy it for the great and obscure ""Worlds Collide"" tune. ""Back In Your Face"" is pure cheese rock, which Def Leppard should halt altogether (seeAdrenalize). Similarly, the single ""Promises"" is sort of half-baked compared to Leppard's past stellar material (seePyromania).On a more positive note, ""Worlds Collide"" more than makes up for the emptiness of the preceeding songs on this 3-song disc. It's got a rough guitar riff that is instantly catchy, Joe Elliott sounds up close and personal but not grating, and the typically melodic Leppard chorus does not sound over-processed, like it does on many of the songs onEuphoria. Tunes like ""Worlds Collide"" make me wish Leppard would get back in touch with their rawer, more genuine sounding side (seeHigh 'N' Dry). Who knows, maybe it'll happen on future records."
3,Not a fan of the Guerrilla,"These books never seems to offer what I'm looking for. The information is just like all any of other business books written for the general public, except it has a catchy brand ""Guerrilla Marketing"". I don't have anything against them, but they are like eating candy without the sugar."
4,Has some mistakes.,The SA2 Prima Guide is very helpful but is has a few mistakes in it. 1. Page 5 In the section Knuckles and Rouge Punch or Kick attack. They have a picture of Eggman instead of Knuckles. 2. Page 6 In the swimming section it shows Rouge using her treasure scope instead of swimming. 3. Page 39 For Mission 4 In Metal Harbor it says you have 5 minutes. This is not true you only have 2 minutes in the game.
3,Needs more older people,"This is a brilliant book in parts but I was disappointed that so many of the regrets are from quite young people who have yet to experience enough of life's tumbles to have regrets that the rest of us can learn from.Worth a read as some parts are outstanding. However, to be considered truly a guidebook by which you could lead your life, I think that it falls a little short."
4,dont listen to the haters!!!,"dont listen to the other ppl on here. this thing works great. and you can get 3 bikes on here. its atight fit, but you can do it. used it all summer and had no problems at all."
2,Frustrating rack,"Very disappointing. More frustrating than the old bike rack I was looking to replace. The strap and buckle system on this bike rack is not reliable. Without an additional double knot of the straps, they will begin to loosen and the rack will become unsteady and begin to slip away from the car (the very first time we used it, one of our three bikes dragged along the highway for a few miles, destroying the bike tire!).As tight as you make the straps, even with the double knots, once you load the bikes, the extra weight will loosen the hook connection with the car. Then you have to undo the knots, pull the straps even tighter and redo the knots, all the while negotiating around the mounted bikes. Takes forever!! Not the rack to get if you need remove rack for access to the trunk. And one of the plastic tie-downs broke the very first time we used this rack."
1,NOPE!,"The second time we visited bike path, on return trip which is only about 4 miles, the plastic part of buckle/strap broke. When we pulled into drive my bike fell off and was run over when backing into parking space. Saris replaced rack promptly. Have had no problems since, but extremely uncomfortable and check often. So no I wouldn't buy this one, prefer my old locking rack with two padded plates that fit together but no longer own that vehicle with hitch."
3,not for comfort bikes or cruisers,"While it fit my car nicely, the hold down straps (what actually holds the bike frame) have small radius on the bottom part where the bike frame would rest. My comfort bike has a large frame, not pee-wee herman cruiser bike large,but about twice as large as a road bike. The bike moved around horribly just on the test drive around the block. So I'm going to have to buy the bike bar beam saris sells. Otherwise I would say this is a good buy, or at the very least worth the money since it is not that high priced. I simply should have done more research."
4,good bike rack,"This rack is easy to put on the car. We traveled about 600 miles with 2 bikes on the rack. The 2 bottom straps tend to loosen up a bit after putting the bikes on, so it's a good idea to check on them when making stops. We also used some bungie cords for some extra security to keep the bikes attached to the rack. We had no problems with the rack or the bikes moving around. Overall, a good product for the price."
2,No grip...no fit,I am difinitely not happy with this product. I attached it to my Outback station wagon and put one bike on it. Before I had gone far the straps had loosened and the bike was bumping up and down. It was dangerous. I stopped at a rest area and adjusted the straps again and tied them into knots to avoid this problem. The clasps should have teeth to dig into the straps to stabilize the rack. I still don't feel comfortable about using the rack and always watch it as I am driving. Who wants to do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Flimsy Saris Sentinel -3 Bike Rack,"This product is not rigid at all; it's just too flimsy, especially if you want to put on a couple of beach cruisers and a kid's bike. The bike frame tie-downs are lacking any safety locks as is the fold out frame itself. Only the top of the frame has slide in clip locks. I cannot believe this many people have found this product to be so great. Great idea gone wrong in its design and build."
3,it works but looks horrible,"This memory unit works, but it looks terribly ugly... if you have the option buy the original vm unit. Any way I bought it to have the complete collection of sega dreamcast accessories in my video game console collection so that ""ugly look"" is not a terrible issue for me."
1,Not worth the few $'s you save.,"I received this memory card as a gift, so I delt with it. I soon found that saving my NFL2K season wasn't working. After scrounging around online, I read an article stating that the card was unable to handle large saves, which appears true. I've had absolutely no problems saving/loading with House of the Dead 2 or Ready 2 Rumble, but as soon as I tried saving from NFL2K or NHL2K, the info was corrupted. All in all, it's much more worth your time to simply pay for a VMU, from which I've had absolutely no problems."
1,Card is not very good,"This memory card is not very good. It did not work for me, two times. I bought the first one, it did not work, neither did the second one. I say spend the extra money for the better VMU."
5,Works great.,"As I bought this product for my 15 year old grandson, I am sure it is working just great, as I haven't had any complaints from him. Derrell Wright"
1,This Sucks,This memory card is horrible. Buy anything but this one. I bought two of these and they BOTH have lost my saves. They won't even load now. I gave this a 1 because it made me. It's not worthy of a 0.It's much better to pay more for something that won't lose your saves. DON'T BUY THIS
1,Not worth it.... doesn't work,We tought that the one we got was bad....after reading all reviews we knew that something was wrong with this memory card. It is frustrating. We took it back to the store for a refund and we are buying the VMC.
1,This product is completely UNRELIABLE -- do not buy,"I've had this thing for only two weeks, and twice now it has lost my save information entirely. No warning, no error message -- I just turn on the machine and find that it says I have no save files. *Extremely* annoying. Even if it did this only once every couple of months I would send the thing back; if it's going to be losing my games once a week I may as well not even have a memory card.Don't go through the frustration of spending hours working through a game like Sonic Adventure and then find you have to start over from the very beginning -- twice. I've now seen in other Internet discussion that my experience with this product is common, and the usual advice is to use the Sega VMU instead."
1,This thing is terrible,"After using it to store about half a season on NBA 2K it showed that files were corrupted and no longer works at all. It is a complete waste of money, and I wasted countless hours playing through a season. The VMU is supposedly much better, although I haven't used it yet. Do not buy this, you will save a few bucks, but pay for it in the long run."
1,Piece of c^@p,"First of all, if you plan on saving your season from NFL 2K onthis card, don't even think about it. Every single time I have triedto save a season on interact's memory card it has become corrupted. I have heard similar stories from friends also, so i know that this is not a isolated insident, be warned! don't go cheap spend the extra bucks and buy a sega vmu!"
1,Pure [garbage],"... I am very disappointed and annoyed at this unreliable piece of hardware.[Some have said] this card can't deal with larger save files...guess what, it's not so good at dealing with smaller files either. Everything from my browser bookmarks, to my nhl2k season, to my Sega GT career have always been lost or corrupted by the poorly designed memory card.I recommend anyone who's serious about making progress in any of their video games avoid this card at all costs. Buy something more reliable, unless you like starting your games all over again because the stupid card put to waste the long hours of gaming you put into it."
1,"i wouldn't give this a single star, but its requiered","i got this card because it was the only thing they had, and i saved my NFL2K season on there and three games into my season it had ''damaged memory'', thank god i just ordered my VMU, do not by this memory card!"
1,i wouldnt even give it a star,dont buy it. i have sonic and house of the dead 2 and i had 70%of sonic down and a turned it on the next morning and it said o %! IHAD EVERYTHING IN HOTD 2 ALSO. AND IT ERASED IT ALL!
2,El peor libro que haya leido,"Yo soy de Medellin al igual que el autor. Desafortunadamente el solo ve lo malo de una ciudad pujante, trabajadora y con ganas de salir adelante. No recomiendo este libro a nadie. Es una verguenza"
4,Muy bueno,Brutal y real. Este libro es muy bueno para aprender sobre la realidad de los asesinos a sueldos y lo que hacen los jovenes para sobrevivir en Colombia.
3,Sensacionalismo llevado al extremo,"A pesar de mostrar de alguna manera la realidad marginal de Medellín, Colombia, en un crudo relato, Fernando Vallejo aprovecha la mala prensa de esta región para exagerar y distorsionar la verdadera realidad. Debe leerse con cuidado, ya que la ficción abunda"
3,la historia de un angel exterminador,"Leí LA VIRGEN DE LOS SICARIOS, por recomendación, pero sinceramente no me gustó mucho.Trata sobre la vida en Colombia. El narrador odia a todo el mundo y su compañero es un asesino que elimina a todos los que de una manera u otra ""molestan"" en la sociedad. Hay relatos violentos y de homesexualidad en practicamente toda la novela. Narra las contradicciones sociales, critica los políticos y la pobreza de los barrios y los ""triunfos"" de la mafia colombiana. Todo esto envuelto en una gran devoción religiosa, pues los protagonistas se mueven de una parroquia a otra para buscar el silencio y consuelo por los pecados."
4,Aisha+David or Aisha+Christopher,"This book was really good but the part about Nina and Ben was very BORING!the story mainly focuses on Aisha and what to do what with her and David going to the prom and christopher returning to the island.Read it too find out how that turns out!!!!It mad me so sick to hear about Lucas invading Zoeys privacy for the THIRD time and publicly emarrassing her.Also the story resumes that whole plot with Claire writing that fake letter and her finall scheme finally lands her with what she wants BUT she also starts feeling guilty seeing her fathers reaction to "" The Munchkins leaving him.Jake is feeling a little rejected after Kate stands him up even though it was LARAS fault.but anyways read the book to find out what happens to the rest of the gang"
4,Another must read book in the making out series!,"I thought that this was a good book. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that it mainly focused on Aisha and her boyfriend problems and they are my least favorite characters. My favorite are Zoey and Lucas and then Nina and Benjamin. But this book is about Aisha mostly and Nina has ran away, Benjamin is still in his ""funk"" and Zoey and Lucas have been fighting though the whole book!! All in all in was another good book, and I am just sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the next one! :)"
3,"Nice pen, dud cartridge?","I received the pen in good time, I like it as it is heavy and presents well. I have it for work and write a lot of minutes in meetings etc. There is nothing worse for me in a meeting to have a pen that doesnt work. So I get a couple of comments on the nice pen and then chuckles as I am trying to get ink of the thing! It doesnt flow well and I end up with a lot of 'no-ink' gaps in my writing. Very frustrating. I assume I have a dud cartridge having read the other reviews? Not very impressed at the moment given I have had it for only a week."
5,"If you love Rob, you'll love this.","Season five of Fantasy Factory does not disappoint. Fans of Fantasy Factory will be treated to all kinds of fun this season and lots of entertaining stunts by the Factory gang. This is one of my favorite seasons because it includes the episode where Rob dresses up Big Cat as the Pasty Prince and encourages Scott to ""embrace his paste."" I laugh every time I watch it.The only drawback to these videos is the quality. They are not in high definition, so they won't look great on your 1080p tv, but they don't look any worse watching them on MTV2 in reruns either."
3,Not my favorite season.,"I have all the seasons of Rob and Big as well as Fantasy Factory. While still fun, this one wasn't as hilarious as the others. I was nervous about it but the DVD-R format looked just fine. There aren't any special features either but I really don't care about those much anymore. Particularily since this season has a couple behind the scenes episodes already."
3,Voice over off,The voice over was way off at some points on the DVDS and it made it very difficult to watch.
3,Alex,"An ok book if you're looking for a fun read. Other reviews have mentioned that book name-drops a bit too much and I would tend to agree because it feels as though the author is smack-dab in the middle of the story verses just narrating; it just does not make for a comfortable read of those passages. But all in all, it conveys some common sense stuff if you have ever worked an internship before hitting the working world, and if nothing else provides for an entertaining read of what corporate life for a big firm is like."
1,Don't waste the money,"I've returned the three copies I purchased. The writing is cynical, unnecessarily raunchy, and of no value. Leave it on the shelf."
3,Could be a great machine,"I have had this machine for a number of years, the upside is great coffee, downside are:1. Finish poor, rust soon appears in the crome, the only saving grace is that it is mostly occurs under the drip tray out of sight.2. It is too easy even after bleeding the pressure, to pop one of the seals when changing the coffee.3. Descaling can be a real pain.In short, when it works, great, but this isn't a low maintance product, a bit like old Italian sports cars"
2,"Mediocre Music From Two Giants, Sound & Picture Quality is Poor","Carmen and Sonny are two of my very favorite musicians. I've heard Carmen live a lot of times, and Sonny several times. I've never heard anything less than very good from either of them, but these performances are well below their normal levels. Carmen is with her working trio, Norman Simmons, Victor Sproles, and Walter Perkins. Sonny with his working trio, Jim Hall, Bob Cranshaw, and Ben Riley.What's even worse is the technical quality. I was working as a broadcast engineer when this material was produced, and the everyday technical quality of video and audio was far better than what appears here. It's so bad it makes me suspect that the DVD was mastered from a VHS cassette! Not only that, this DVD doesn't play on my DVD player, I can only play it on my computer, but the screen says "" Format: Black & White, Color, DVD, Full Screen, Import, NTSC"" It's not Color, it's Black and White! The only thing in color is the logo of the producer."
3,well...,"My first CD from Aine Minouge was 'Between the worlds', and it will forever be one of my favorites, but 'Celtic spirit' simply did not live up to expectation. Simply put, its a matter of tatstes. If you like your celtic music light and easy, this one's for you; if you prefer more somber, mood driven tunes, turn your attention to 'Between the worlds'."
4,Prelude to a great italian singer-composer,"This is the debut of Raf (Raffaele Riefoli)as a singer in his native language, italian. ""Svegliarsi un anno fa"" (Waking up a year ago) was recorded in 1988 and is perhaps the least known of Raf's albums. Notwithstanding this, each song in this album reveals his creativeness and his sensual voice. Perhaps ""Svegliarsi..."" stands out from the rest as a relaxing, nostalgic, easy-going song. It is hard to find, so I would encourage to all those who collect italian music to have it."
5,Great album,"This is a beatiful album of this italian singer, with the great performance of UMBERTO TOZZZI like frist guitar"
2,d.murphy,"While the dishes are beautiful, the large plates are so big they don't fit in my standard size wall cabinets. I had to rearrange my whole kitchen so I could store them in my base cabinets. Also, they DON'T MICROWAVE WELL!!! The plates get very hot while the food doesn't. If you don't plan to put them in the microwave I would say ok because they are so pretty."
2,chips easily/ doesn't microwave well,"I had wanted phaltzgraff for a long time and finally bought my set of Napoli 3 years ago. When I first got my dishes I had to rearrange the kitchen cupboards to store all the pieces and had problems because the plates were so large. I used my dishes as every day dishes and used a dishwasher for cleaning. The chips started occuring 6 months into use. Soon after my salad plates seemed to develope small linear lines, increasing to a linear weakness and then crack and break in half. You can't use these dishes in the microwave, they get too hot and your food remains cool. You have to use potholders to pull them out of the microwave after only 40 seconds. They are very colorful, however the paints very in intensity of hue significantly from dish to dish. They are very heavy. Nice to look at and that is the best thing I can say about them. After waiting so long for my first set of Phaltzgraff I bought a lemon."
2,Disappointed,"I got this DVD and was not that impressed. The work out was slow and boring and was practically sitting doing very limited and small stretches and was not like the yoga i'm used to at all. Granted, I only did the third trimester one, but this was enough to put me off. I have been much more impressed with Shiva Rea or Jennifer Wolfes yoga which provides stretch and excercise."
1,Definately NOT a female feel good book,"I simply did not like this book. I have read many RDI books, as well as a ton of chic-lit. I just didn't relate to her. What woman of this generation falls for a man that wants her barefoot and preggers? I was almost screaming at the book at the end. I thought Chic-lit was about career-minded females. And all the storylines? What is that? It seems Riker took storylines for different books and tried to make them one. Just didn't make sense. Sister, Mom, Grandmother, Affair, Dylan, Guy in apartment, Work, co-coworker, Friend with baby. TOO MANY characters with no development. However, I still can't get over the whole ""how sexy to be pregnant and lactating"". Ew."
4,A pretty good book.......,"Darcie is a young woman who is not only appealing to men; she also has a good head on her shoulders. She is an outgoing woman who is a little to trusting of people, yet her vulnerability is refreshing.She carries on a once a week relationship with a gay man who is rich, educated and attractive and married. His unscrupulous taste for refreshing women like Darcie leaves no side effects from his infidelity.Darcie lives with her Grandmother and her Grandmothers wicked cat, who among other things keeps Darcie on her toes. The Grandmother is a bit of a penthouse queenie. This makes the book all the more interesting.The book is written in good taste, and has some good lessons that can be learned from reading. Everyone will enjoy this book."
1,"Boring Book, Not even for the beach","I read this book on the beach and not only did I find it boring but also stupid. I was sorry I even finished the book. All the negative reviews this book received are correct. Some of the sub plots, ie, the grandmother, Claire, the relationship with her mother, her sister moving to NY had nothing to do with the story. Additionally, the author never fully developed those characters. Too much sex throughout the book and I actually had nightmares picturing the old grandmother having sex with someone more than 1/2 her age. The book was predictable from beginning to end and I should have skipped the entire middle."
2,Not exactly chick lit,"More of a romance novel than RDI's touted ""chick lit"", this story is amusing but falls short: 1. Why does Darcie talk to herself? Is she entering senility a bit early? 2. Why does her grandmother's sex life have to come into play? 3. Why, oh why, does the author use the pathetic device of ""phone sex""? (It makes me cringe just to wonder.) Fun for the beach, but not the best RDI has offered."
1,"A really bad Red Dress ink book, should be zero stars!","When I read that read the Red Dress Ink were coming out, I was very much looking forward to them. I first RDI book purchase was ""Sprapless"" by Leigh Riker and I glad that I just finished reading the book last night, because if I read it earlier, I may have never bought another book from the RDI line again. This book was just awful! I can't understand of the life of me how the editors thought this book was a ""Chick-lit"" book. I could care less what happen to either Darcie or Dylan. The only reason that I finished the book was the fact that spent 12.95 of my hard earn money to read it.! Note to Amazon.com you should really have Zero stars, for books that really bad, like ""Strapless!"""
1,"Smart, Ambitious Woman seeks Smart, Modern Novel","If you're looking for a book about an empowered woman getting ahead in the world while keeping her love life in check, do NOT pick up this book. Not only was it frustrating every time the main character referred to herself by her full name, but the entire book could have been narrowed down to 2 pages. The relationships between characters were flimsy and narrator's point of view shifted unnecessarily. Let the knight in shining armor go rescue a character in a Judith McNaught book. I'm looking for a book about a woman who can rescue herself."
1,Eh...,"simply stated, whole lot of sex and very little plot. And it dragged my god did it drag! By the end of the book all i could think was 'just get together already for christ sakes! You know your going to!'i just really wanted it to be over. I personally cared more about the Darcie - greta situation than i did the Darcie-Dylan situation. It just had no pop or substance I really did not enjoy it."
2,In agreement,"I want to love each and every RDI book, so I came here to see if it was just me that wasn't digging this book. This book seriously lacks the usual female companionship found in the RDI and other chick lit novels, I really felt like this was some re-titled and beefed up Harlequin book. Which is fine if that's your thing, but if you're reading Red Dress Ink, I think it's not."
2,Strapless,"Darcie Baxter is a single woman from Ohio trying to make it in New York City working at Wunderthings Lingerie and having a hotel room based affair with a businessman. However, her life is about to change when she gets sent to Australia on business and meets Dylan Rafferty, a sexy Australian sheep farmer.This is a quick read that borders on the ridiculous, as the plot is unrealistic for most of the book, and often seems only to serve as a lead to one of the many, many sex scenes, many of which are also ridiculous and implausible.Darcie irritated me, as she is always complaining to her friend Claire about her lot in life, but appears to do nothing besides sleep with multiple men, whine, and talk back to her boss. The male characters have no personality at all; the only interesting characters are Gran and her cat Sweet Baby Jane.Only recommended if you're stuck on an airplane for a few hours."
2,one of my least favorite RDI books.,"This was just an OK book for me. Darcie and her 84 year old grandmother having detailed discussions about their sex lives was just too over-the-top and unrealistic. As well, I was put off by Darcie's continued relationship with Merrick. The storyline had great potential, with an exotic setting, which could have been better developed. Instead, the chapters seemed to focus on less interesting things. I recommend skipping this one, as it is not up to RDI standards."
3,An average tribute,"Peter Gabriel is one of the most influential artists of our time, yet it seems like the rest of the world has yet to recognize this fact.This album is a nice tribute in thought or effort, yet it still misses the boat in many ways. Some of the tracks seem too commercial to the point that I am surprised that Peter even allowed this album to be produced. Aside from a couple of tracks, this album is basically designed to be listened to in a doctor's office or on an elevator.This is an album that can be listened to once or twice at best. Other than that, the only time you will hear it is when you are in a waiting room."
2,"Well written, elegiac, but slow, and ultimately boring","Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully.One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as ""elegiac"" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far. Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative. Perfect example, ATONEMENT. Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read."
1,Huh?,"This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego. This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing. By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling. There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why. Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence."
2,Made cheaply!,"Grips fit the gun perfectly. But due to the soft rubber, The bottom of the grip is very loose and moves around if you squeeze the grip."
4,Good Grips,These grips increase the size of the gun's handle considerably in length and thickness. They seem to reduce recoil as well. The fit is not perfect but good. I have adjusted them slightly which improved the fit.
3,Great topic-poorly written,"The Chamberlain-Russell ""rivalry"" is one of the more interesting stories in sport history over the past 40 years, which makes just about any account of it at least halfway intersting. Unfortunately, this book is just that-halfway interesting. It seems as if the author doesn't really understand basketball, and in many places the book reads like a sports bio written for adolescents. His use of supposed direct quotes is laughable, and the sources are poorly documented."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This was supposed to be a sequal to the WOS trilogy but isn't yet. This takes place after DOAFS or DOALS only. It took me a little while to get involved but did make me want to read the rest of the trilogy. Knaak is as good a writer as ever & this trilogy shouldn't have written by anyone else but...DL is about the only thing I read that's makes what more but it desperately needs a new direction, one I hope these post-WOS books give. It needs an evil force to rise up & to stay aggresive for more than 3 novels, one to even rule Krynn for a period like the Empire from Star Wars. This should've the Dark Knights going all the way back to DOSF but maybe this is just wishful thinking."
2,Not for M65 UNLESS you trim the DC plug!,"Its not a direct replacement as claimed.The original DC plug that plugs into the Laptop has a stepped-down diameter, but the DC plug on this adapter does not have the stepped-down diameter, so it does not fit all the way into the socket.I used a razor-knife to trim the dc plug so that the diameter steps down so it will fit the socket.I started to send it back, but It worked ok after my operation."
5,BRILLIANT BRAVO EXTRAORDINARY FIND MORE JUDY!!!!!!!!!!,"Judy Garland lovers, this is really it!!! What an unexpected thrill!!! This two CD set includes Judy's closing performance of her first engagement at the palace, recorded live. Simply amazing, extraordinarily thrilling, this live performance should be required listening for any future performer. The duets are joyous and glorious..included is precious, witty, touching long forgotten dialog stretches and once in a lifetime duets. What a find this NEW Judy is!!!!"
1,Straight to the kitchen junk-drawer,"This case is made of thick stiff cow-hide making it large and stiff. The single small belt clip balances the case in a horizontal position so it falls if you move around much and because of its bulk, it gets in your way before it falls off."
5,REMARKABLE & RECOMMENDABLE!!!,THIS CHARGER IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE CHARGER THAT CAME WITH THIS PHONE!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE OR THE LENGTH OF THIS CHARGER! I HOPE THAT THIS REVIEW HELPS YOU!!! I TRIED TO SUM IT UP IN A NUT SHELL!
4,"It is what it says it is, plus","What can I say about this book? It's not a tremendous read - it's not supposed to be. It lives up to its title, and is a useful resource for those of us who cast horoscopes, or are learning to do so. It contains not only tables of houses, but explains how those houses are derived, and gives a wealth of information on casting charts that is difficult to find elsewhere. In short, it doesn't just present the information it claims to present, but it also gives some background on how that information is obtained, and what it represents.Worth every penny."
