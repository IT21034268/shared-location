1,Missing Pages,"Dear Sir,I have just returned from the US of A . I bought the book ""Sams Teach Yourself Active Server Pages in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself in 24 Hours Series). "" from there.there are 12 crucial pages missing in the 3rd chapter of the book.I could have sent you the book back for replacement but due to the heavy cost involved in sending it to you through courier I am sorry my budget would not allow that. Also the Indian ""custom department"" is such that they would open it and chances are that the defective book might not even reach you.I would appreciate if you could look into the matter and pass it to the author and the printing press at the earliest and see what can be done I am working on a project which has to be completed by 31st January else I will have to undergo losses.My address:Mohit Sippy B-9/11 Vasant Vihar New Delhi 110057 INDIATel: 91-11-6140158An early response would be highly appreciated.Thank You,Mohit Sippy Email: msippy@hotmail.com"
3,It gives brief start for beginers.,In fact this book made me my very first win ever in this world and since then it has been hard to even fall to more better players than i am. The writer is just let me say a MAGICIAN in even his writings.
2,Better books available to learn ASP,"This book was very disappointing, to say the least. I purchased it with the intent of being on my way to understanding the fundamentals of ASP programming; unfortunately, like many other reviewers have pointed out, the authors could stand to enroll in a few high school level English classes. If you don't have an intermediate to advanced level of VBScript and HTML knowledge, don't buy this book! Save yourself some money and master VBScript before tackling ASP, as doing so will prove to help you immensely. Having read this book and done the examples and questions I feel like several hundred pages are missing--most of the examples/exercises asked you to code things that weren't even mentioned once in the book or that were exceptionally vague."
5,You should buy this book IF. . .,"I recently purchased this book to learn how to make my webpages interact with a live database. This book does that and more.After reading other people's reviews I need to qualify my ""it's incredible"" rating. I am a PC fanatic who has never used VBscript. However, I did do a bit of basic programming in high school. If ""for . . .next"" is not a foreign statement to you, then you will greatly benefit from this book. Because the examples given are very practical, they can easily be modified to fit your needs. Change a date here, a statement there and you will have the custom page you envisioned.Personally, I am simply amazed at what I learned in less than a day. If you are not a programmer but are not intimidated by a few lines of code, this is the book for you. If you're stumped but you hate buying computer books because you usually like to figure it out yourself, this is the book for you."
2,Too complicated,The examples in this book are way too complicated for a beginner. There are much less complex ways of doing the things they do in this book. I had a very difficult time understanding their code and modifying it for my own use.
2,Not very useful,"I'm going to the bookstore right now to return it.I needed to learn (from scratch) about ASP and enough VBScript to get a simple form running. I slogged through 5-1/2 'hours' (chapters) and realized the whole book was going to skim over the main points. The chapter on gathering data from the user should have helped me; it gave a couple simple examples, but not enough information to customize to what I need.I took Active Server Pages for Dummies out from the library and, though I've never wanted to read a Dummies book, find it a lot more systematic in its approach and a much easier read."
1,Chaos,"This book fails its purpose. The layout of the info is all wrong and there is no gentle step-through. I bought the book because other books I bought (SQL, VB) in the Sams series have taught me well.If you are new to ASP and pick up this book, you will find to be a very difficult language to learn simply because this book rushes into things too quickly and leaves the reader quite baffled.If you want to learn ASP and if you want to learn it well, buy the Beginning Active Server Pages book by Wrox. That was the book I used to pick up ASP I still flip through it every now and again."
1,Do not even bother with this book if you are a beginner.,"Unless you know VB Script this book is a total waste of time and money. I know some VB, but a lot of the stuff was pretty foreign to me and the explanations weren't very helpful. I've been told ASP is easy but this book sure didn't make it seem that way. I would recommend learning VB Script first and then this book may be more helpful."
2,Needlessly complex due to writing style and mismarketing,"This book is made needlessly complex by the author's writing style. Concepts are presented and inadequately explained, because he assumes you have a strong VB background, even though the book is marketed as a beginning level book on the back. Might be ok as a follow-up book to something else."
2,Not that impressed,"If you have the patience I think this book could be good. In my opinion it fails to deliver because it strays from the format that is the reason I usually buy their books. This book spends WAY too much time explaining code and way too little giving you examples of how to do things within ASP and creating commom web pages and functionality. If you have alot of patience buy this book, but if you're looking for one full of step-by-step tutorials then I'd look elsewhere. Also, if you have the most recent version of IIS it's outdated."
1,Worst technical book I've ever read,"I did manage to learn ASP despite how poorly written this book is. However, it's overtly apparent that this book is written by people who speak English as a second language. It seems there was no copy editor.If you don't mind ambiguous sentences and code examples that don't work then perhaps you'll learn something from this book. Otherwise, STAY AWAY! You'll be swearing at every page.I wish I could have chosen zero stars for this review."
3,I'm not completely happy with the book,"Yes, you can get a lot of information from this book if you know nothing about ASP, but examples of code are too complicated. I was able to accomplish the same result with 38 lines of code instead of 178 that author offers. If you need good explanation and systematized information, look somewhere else."
2,Get a ghost writer?,"This book would be very good if the authors could write; the content is fine, the organization is good but...hmmm. It has a lot to say but takes a poorly written (and often overly complex) manner to explain the concepts involved. You hold your breath reading, since at any time a paragraph will appear that is so ambiguous it will take 10 minutes for you to decipher into what could have been clearly written, and understood in 1. Still, if you are patient you can eventually glean some good stuff here, and be well on your way to making respectable ASP."
1,ASP in 24 Hours (Provided you are running NT!),"Despite the minimum requirements including Windows 95 / 98. This book is unuseable unless you are running Windows NT. Half way through chapter 1 the author says ""I made a decision for you - you are using IIS or PWS/NTW"". An leaves you facing a brick wall wondering what to do next! This is one of the worst books I have ever read (and I'm an old hack!)."
2,Not what I expected,"Again, the problem with buying unseen off the internet; being in love with the woodcuts of Durer and Altdorfer, I was hoping for an introduction to a wider range of such works by artists of the period. Unfortunately, what you get are not full page illustrations of the woodcuts, but photographs of the actual pages in the original books, curled edges and all, and usually in less than half-size so that one is straining to see the image. I presume this method of reproduction is meant for antiquarian book lovers, but certainly not for someone interested in the art. Know what you are getting and you won't be disappointed."
1,Waste of time & money,"This author babbles on about horrific case histories & never does get to the point. This book grossly lacks anything the reader can use to keep their pets healthy in any shape or form. I was very annoyed. Thanks, Lynn"
1,You get what you pay for,"The price on this case was too good to be true. It's worth about 10 bucks. I was afraid to put decent chips in it because I'm almost sure it would fall part. The material is cheap, the glue residue is all over the felt, the handle is plastic. I never bothered to send it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I gave it to my kids."
2,An utter disappointment,"Sure, the historical aspects of this series were great in the first few books, but this book's plot fell way short of the mark. Buckley devotes 50+ pages rehashing character developments from the first books, the supposed intrigue wasn't the least bit engaging, and the only romantic tension that exists is between Ursula and Brockley. And then, the reader is only supposed to feel sorry for how guilty she feels about Fran's feelings. The title is also completely inappropriate. The Queen's Ambition has nothing to do with the story.In a word, this book is boring. Buckley should have ended the series here. I certainly won't read any future Ursula Blanchard novels."
3,Good...but not her best,The plot on this one is just a bit stretched for credibility...is Fiona Buckley running out of materia?
5,Excellent book,"This is a masterful work--truly destined to be a classic. But readers should understand that this is not a book of ""pop religion""; it's a meticulously researched academic book, designed for serious students of American history. And it's an outstanding one."
5,True Help,This dvd is a true help in providing a bluegrass player the opportunity to play along and pick up good basic information about jamming
4,Ultra fine tip stops writing,"Good markers, however, the ultra fine tip will stop writing. So I draw a squiggle on a separate piece of paper and that gets it going again. It happens frequently enough to be a moderate annoyance."
4,Sharpie Twin Tip Pen,"bought this and didn't even see it was twin pointed pen so it was better than expected since I can right on my dvd copies on smaller scale.the smaller point dries out faster than the bigger point side, not sure why (still using the first one)"
4,good to know I'm not degrading my CDs and DVDs now,I was shocked to learn that conventional markers degrade CDs and DVDs.I only use this type of marker now.
1,Do not purchase,As good as most Sharpie products are these are the worst. Within a few weeks the fine tips dry out and will not write.
4,good markers,cant beat these markers for writing on cdsa very good value would most certaily buy them againdont but cheap imitations
1,"Useless Piece of... um, Junk","Not loud enough to be of any use in the kitchen, I decided to keep it in my briefcase to use for other purposes. Not only doesn't it have a seconds timer or a reset feature, but it has the nasty habit of starting itself while it jostles around in my briefcase.Imagine my reaction when, while passing through a security checkpoint near Ground Zero last week where they x-ray your bags before letting you pass, an alarm started going off inside my briefcase! I was practically tackled to the ground by security.I still keep it in my briefcase, but I've removed the battery for my own safety. UGH."
3,Disappointed,"Many of the campgrounds in this book are, in fact easily accessable to RVs and 2 wheel drive vehicles. I expected it to cover more out of the way, difficult to get to campgrounds, where campers have peace and quiet. I was disappointed to not find any undiscovered, little known campgrounds. It does give fairly good information about things to do in the areas where the campgrounds are located. But if you're looking for some ideas on places to tent camp, might as well just buy ""Colorado Campgrounds, the 100 best"". It has great pictures so you can really get an idea of what the campgrounds are like and most of the campgrounds mentioned in ""The best tent camping"" are also found in ""The 100 best""."
5,Mark of the Lioin,Book came in shape it was suggested - and on time - very happy with the service and the quality
5,inspirational,"Mark of the Lion.these books arrived to me quicker than i expected and they were in perfect condition.the three books had me engrossed, i didnt want to put them down fantastic books,very upbuilding ,touched my heart and made me cry at times.Amazons service was great i am totally satisified and will continue to do service with you"
5,wonderful!,"this series is an incredible depiction of a godless era where sin reigned. the heroine walks out her faith in a beautifully , glorifying the King kind of way. yes, this book deals with sin very frankly and openly. the author does not sugar coat or shy away from the yuckiness of the generation, but she depicts it for what it is- corrupt, repulsive SIN. i admire a Christian author that will honestly portray temptaions of the flesh and spirit while still honoring God with the topic at hand. these are now one of my favorite series, and being the avid reader i am, that says a lot!"
5,I wish a fourth book could be added to the series!,"This trilogy is AMAZING! Once you start reading, you can't stop! I made the mistake of starting this series the week before finals, and I often blew off studying to immerse myself in the well-thought-out characters Rivers creates. I recommend these books to anyone who needs a little hope or reassurance in their lives."
4,Intense Reading for Dark Times,"While reading the first book, I was a little unsure that I wanted to continue. This series is very different than her other books, but you just have to keep in mind the time period in which the stories took place. The stories pick up about 40 years after Christ's death and resurrection. Rome was a powerhouse and it was a very dark time. The first book has about 4 different story lines going on, but it is important to understand these story lines to be able to move onto the second and third book. The second book, Echo in the Darkness, is phenominal. It will really touch your heart and make you reevaluate your dedication to Christ. It took me a while to get into the third book, As Sure as the Dawn, but again...great read. If you can get past the darkness, you will love these."
5,fabulous,Cannot remember enjoying any book as much as this Mark of the Lion series. Highly reccommend the triology to anyone. Francine Rivers writes beautifully.
5,Wow!,"A good friend recommended this trilogy to me and all I can say is, ""Wow!"" These books are exciting and very well written. The author sends her Christian message without crossing the line to preachy, which I really appreciate. The series is definitely worth your time."
5,Good enough to steal,"I teach at a jail; I purchase many books for my students there. If a book is particularly good, someone steals it. The better it is, the faster it gets stolen. This whole set went missing as soon as word got out that it had to do with early Christianity, The Coliseum, soldiers, man-eating lions, etc. Truly it is a great series, and I hope it is still circulating in one of the jail pods. I like the lessons the books teach, plus they're exciting to read. (All of Francine Rivers' Christian-based books are well-done.)"
2,Mark of the Lion trilogy,"Rivers began as a romance novelist, and she remains one. Mark of the Lion is predictable, hits all the hot-button issues (abortion, homosexuality, right-to-die, etc.), and gives the reader a steady diet of evangelical Christian reinforcement. That said, the books are quick, easy reads, plot-driven and pleasant. If you enjoy happily-ever-after endings, historical fiction, and a persistent Christian message, you'll probably like these (my mother loved these books--she's a Nicolas Sparks fan). If you are interested in excellent literary craftsmanship, look elsewhere."
2,Not what I expected,"While I found the writing and the stories in these books engaging and interesting, I was bothered by the unrealistic characters who were often too perfect and often behaved in manners that seemed to be uncharacteristic. As is often the case in this type of Christian fiction, both the characters and the author seemed, at times, hypocritical. Perhaps this was intentional, but it was quite a put-off for me, mostly because it seemed to be an accident of the author's personal biases.I was also troubled by the historical research; many things implied to be true of this period and of Christianity in this period were just plain false. When I read historical fiction, I expect things to be actually based on historical truth.In the end, I have enjoyed reading the books for their stories, but a few of the other characteristics of the books would lead me not to highly recommend them."
3,Not included,"In our gift of Mark of the Lion, our receiver did not get the note we composed which was to be included. Therefore, they did not know who sent the books, and why.We feel badly about their confusion. Can you please mail some type of an apology to them."
4,A historically accurate and fascinating romance,"Rivers excells in historical fiction. These novels, though bitingly real, surpass the general idea of ""historical romance."" They are an excellent read and a tribute to the author's hard work, dedication, and fatih."
5,you can't put them down,These books are amazing. Once you start reading them you will not be able to put them down. It really made me look at my own walk with christ and want to be closer to him. Read them you will not regret it.
4,Excellent - exciting & realistic!,I was in Spain visiting a friend & she loaned me this series. I read the whole thing in 2 weeks! I highly recommend it - especially books 1 & 2.
5,Francine Rivers fan,"I'm still thinking about Hadassah in an A Voice in the Wind and An Echo in the Darkness. What a strong character. It's taking me longer to get through As Sure As the Dawn because I don't like reading about angry people, Atretes. But all the stories are so engrossing. These novels help me solidify my trust and faith in Jesus Christ."
5,Mark of the Lion Series Review,"Francine Rivers provides one of the most dramatic and realistic series of christian fiction writing I have read. This is the first time I have read anything by Ms. Rivers and the first time reading christian fiction. I raved so much about the series while reading that my wife picked up ""Voice in the Wind"" and could not put it down. We are now confirmed Francine Rivers readers.Thomas E. Hogan"
5,Review,"These books are amazing! The best series I've ever read. Very inspirational, and they definitely changed my life forever. I would recommend these books for girls and guys of all ages. When I saw Christian fiction as the genre, I thought it would be boring. I was in for a big surprise... These books took me through quite an adventure!"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"Wow. That's all I can think of when talking of these books. I haven't read #3 yet, but I'm sure it'll be as breath-taking as the first two. I'm amazed at Rivers' ability to hold my attention through many different characters. Usually I latch on to one or two and care little for the others, but I found myself drawn into each character's story. Reading Hadassah's story has helped me to see the flaws in my own faith, and I know I will be the better for having read this series."
5,Simply amazing!,I couldn't put the books down! I lose more sleeping reading the series than taking care of my two small babies!
5,Mark of the Lion,"These are the best of her books. It makes one think about what is going on in our country today. I am on the third book, As Sure as the Dawn. As soon as I finish this book I want to read my Bible and check the places mentioned in the Bible."
5,Liz's view,"I borrowed these books from a friend one at a time after they were first released and was totally captivated from page one! i love how Francine blends historical facts with fiction to truly give one a practical view of how life might have been like in the early years of Christianity. I went out and bought my own copies, re-read each one, shared them till I didn't get them back so I went out and bought them again. Can't say enough good about Francine's style of writing and her ability to draw you into the story. My perception of that era was greatly influenced by these novels. Not one second was an effort to stay focused, I just about lived them. Thank you, Francine. Once again, you surpassed my expectations! God bless you and...Keep 'em coming!"
5,The best non-scriptural literature I've ever read.,I love these books!!! They only convicted me more of my beliefs and encouraged me to continue having faith for the spouse and life God has for me. I found myself wanting to be more like Hadassah but realized I was more like Rizpah. These books will change your life! :)
1,Not What It Seems,I bought this book because I wanted to find something for my teenage daughters to read that had a Christian theme and did not have obscene content. I read the first 50 pages of this book and it had more obscene descriptions of murder and rape and vile things that no one would ever want to read about than just about any book I have ever read. I couldn't finish reading it because it made me sick.
3,When Shall These Things Be,"If you are a Realized Eschatologist this book is a must. It is the most serious attack on that position I have found. It's for certain you will be faced with this material before long if you haven't already had to think through the arguments. You probably will not get much out of the first chapter by Gentry, but read it because later on in the book that chapter will be a serious piece of the puzzle."
5,"If you could read any book, read this one","This book is a miraculous read. It is eloquently writen, and like by all types of people. Reading this series changed my life, and showed me who god really is. The information on this culture and time period is amazing, but the characters are undescribably real; I'm sure everyone can connect woith this book. I have never met anyone who has thought of this series as less than the best. The only thing to keep in mind is that you have to read all three books to fully get the entire story... but trust me, the moment you finish the first on, you will go to the store and buy the other two...that's what I did!"
5,Amazing!,"Absolutely loved this series. The first two books are my favourite ever reads. Would recommend to anyone wanting to read something inspiring, uplifting, romanctic and much more."
5,This set of books touched My Heart,I loved this set of books each story has serious messages meant to help and provide thought provoking interest to those with some what similar.
1,Jamaica Reggae Concert,"I bought this DVD believing that it was a Sting, the Police ex-member DVD but it wasn't. This DVD it's a concert held in Jamaica with lots of Reggae bands, and its Audio and Video quality is extremely poor. I like reggae, and when I received the DVD, first I was really disappointed because it wasn't what I was expecting, anyway I decided to watch the video and no one of the performances satisfied me. Seelers should write about what they are selling, don't you think?"
5,Aaaaa...Oooooooo!!!,"Nice and loud call with the horn attached. Still practicing with it, hopefully I can fool one to come in for me."
1,A waste of shipping,"The item I received was totally worthless. Occasionally, it produced another reading besides 62.4F. When it did, it automatically switched to Celsius and wouldn't switch back to Farenheit.As it was made in China, it has traveled halfway around the world only to provide an inaccurate temperature of the bottom of a dumpster in Arizona where it now resides."
5,"Great value, accurate, easy to use.","Had to replace my digital food thermometer after inadvertantly melting one by leaving it too close to the BBQ. This one is simple to use, accurate and a great value. Simply turn it on, insert into whatever you're cooking and read the result. It appears to be highly accurate. Only two switches: on/off and C/F. One important note: be sure to turn it off after using. There is no auto-off and it would be very easy to waste a battery in the first use. It somes with a convenient sleeve with a shirt clip and an additional bettery."
4,Much nicer than an analog (?) thermometer,"Bought primarily for meat, but also found it useful in testing water temperature for preparing bread dough. Have not calibrated it or anything, so I have no idea how accurate it is -- but it seems to work well."
4,Reliable and long-lasting,I've used this model for two or three years without any problems. I'm replacing the battery for the first time now.
3,Cheap thermometer,"This is a cheap thermometer that works well. It reads out tenths of a degree up to 100' F, then only in increments of 0.5'. The switch is curiously sharp and uncomfortable but at this price I guess I can't complain."
2,"Works well, but poor construction","Although this produce works as it is supposed to, you must be careful when using it to avoid the top coming off. It is designed to open so that the battery can be replaced, but easily comes open when pulling the thermometer out of a piece of meat or even out of the protective sleeve. All that holds the top to the probe are a couple wires once it is open, so it would be very easy for it to get damaged."
2,slow and inaccurate,"I bought this thermometer at a grocery store. It takes a very long time to check the temperature, and does not seem accurate compared with the in-oven probe thermometer. Now, I just use that probe thermometer to stick into a couple different areas of the meat/chicken after I pull it out of the oven, to ensure the meat is cooked everywhere. I stopped using this ""instant"" read thermometer that takes a full minute while it slowly counts up to the temperature."
3,Ok thermometer,"I bought this due to great reviews, and I'd say it is ok. It reads digitally and seems accurate, but the instant part is a bit of a disappointment. The reading is a bit slow compared to other instant read thermometers that I have used."
2,OK until Not OK,"Thermometer worked great until the battery gave out. Installing a replacement battery was no problem: just flip up the tab on the side of the soldered holder to slide out the old battery. However, in the process, a solder point to one of the sensor wires tore loose and converted the item to garbage. I was being very gentle, too. We're going to buy a sturdier product this next time."
1,Broken on arrival,"I wanted to get a digital candy thermometer for increased accuracy when I cook.Some reviewers suggested that this thermometer was unreliable. I should have given those reviews more weight and walked away.This thermometer was a huge disappointment.It was flimsyIt read 72.8 degrees F when repeatedly immersed in a 280 degree candy preparation. Most of the time the LED display would blank, so I had no reading.It is in the trashI'm back with my mercury thermometer."
1,Not good enough to use - waste of money,"It reacts way too slowly. You can't leave it in whatever you're measuring since it's not liquid proof or heat proof. So you stand there with the oven door open watching it slowwwly climb to the actual temperature.The diameter of the probe is bigger than necessary, so it pokes a large hole in the food.The switch is too delicate to last. Turn it on/off once and it's obvious.I've never used it past the first two times I used it....shoulda returned it but I waited too long."
1,Would not buy it again.,"I used this item 1 time. In the time it took to register the temperature,on a piece of meat, it just shut itself down. Now it stays on for only a couple of seconds, then turns itself off."
1,Taylor Digital Instant-Read Pocket Thermometer,"Purchased two (2) of these items through amazon.com. When I used one it would shut off in a few seconds, before it got up to temperature. After times of this I went to change batteries, ""didn't know what else to do"".I opened the case to change the battery and the wires had been hot glued to the battery and battery holder. Whence trying to remove the glue ed in battery the holder, which is also the battery ground, broke off.I have through to many times of trying to return defective items,SO-OO I through it in the trash. I have not tried the other on as of yet!!!"
1,It lasted 2 days,"We ordered some of these and none of them lasted more than a week. The one I was given worked well enough, but the on/off switch broke and then it wouldn't turn off. The battery was dead in two days. That was the day I received it. They are poorly constructed, find something else."
2,Great at first....died too soon!,I really loved this at first. It was my first meat thermometer and it worked very well. But not even a few months old and it died on me. I thought it might be the battery and figured I could just get a new battery. When I opened it up I could not get the battery out so I could just replace it. I have never seen something where the battery is not able to come out so you can replace it. I was very disappointed and now looking for a new one to replace this. You really get what you pay for.
1,not worth the money,This is one of the lousier thermometers I bought. It eventually broke and I barely ever use it. Don't buy!
1,What a turkey,"I used this the first time in a 20 lb turkey, inside a roasting bag.It melted!!! I'm not kidding. A total piece of junkBuy a [cheaper] analog unit"
1,Terrible quality,"Well....I read many of the bad reviews and thought 'it can't be that bad'. I was wrong. The flimsy plastic on/off switch was very hard move right out of the pack. It actually broke off after just a few uses. Pay a few dollars more and get something of better quality.Edit....I picked up aCDN ProAccurate Quick-Read DTQ450X Thermometerfrom Amazon and I love it. It reads quicker than the Taylor, has a calibration function and it looks like it is built to last. Pay a few dollars more for the tremendous difference in quality....I wish I had."
4,Very good!,"I purchased this unit due to a fridge that would become warm/cold and sooner or later will give up on me. I had a digital unit, but it's version of being accurate was +/- 8 deg F. That was not good enough for me.This Taylor is QUICK in adjusting to a reading. The sleeve it comes with is for good reason when you are not using it for food. It is intended for use with meats for safe cooking.So if you need to check the temp of the burgers you are frying on the grill, or concerned about the fridge not being cool enough you can use this to check both.Only downside I have come across so far, the reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars, is the connection or unit seems to be a little questionable. I have not used it that much. It's possible I just need to install a new battery but no alert has come on of that nature. For the price, it was well worth it!!"
3,Great but not what I expected.,"I should have been wary with other reviews of the product, but I wanted to give these a shot. I picked up two of them, one for the kitchen and another for the BBQ Grill. Though they do work well and have proven to be a handy cooking utensil, they are far from an ""instant read"" as described.I used suggestions from other users and leave the item turned off before inserting it into the meat. When I turn it on, it takes a a few seconds to read a temperature, then it slowly adjust continuously and never really settles on a solid temperature. In one case, it first read 125 degrees and within a minute had dropped to under 95 degrees. I have learned to wait at least a minute to get a good reading - but at least it beats my old dial type thermometer.I would suggest this product for everyday use if you are on a budget, but make sure to use it as described above. I will keep mine for a while, but will likely purchase something better when I can afford it."
1,Too delicate for any kitchen,"I do not recommend this thermometer, as it is too delicate for any kitchen. First of all, the on-off switch is much too small and finicky; it is easily broken. Second, the entire assembly is not liquid-proof or even liquid-resistant, so watch out if you drop this thermometer into a liquid! Perhaps water isn't fatal to it, as you can open the case and dry it out. But forget about the thermometer if you get any kind of oil into it. The oil will seep into the display, rendering it unreadable or, worse, simply non-functional.I have already been through two of these thermometers. Now I'm buying the old-fashioned kind with the analog dial."
3,Pretty good overall.,"This isn't a thermometer to write home about - it's adequate, and that's that. Its small size is convenient, yet the display is large enough to read easily. ""Instant"" is a little optimistic, though; it takes a few moments to register the correct temperature. The on/off switch is tiny, lacks any ergonomics at all, and is quite stiff, which makes it a small irritant, and occasional nail-destroyer. Still, it's better than the analog thermometers I've used, and much faster. Don't get this sucker wet, though - it'll temporarily screw up the LCD. Further, if you drop it into, say, a pot of boiling water, the plastic LCD overlay will warp, and the glue will mostly unstick, and it's generally unhappy. However, it's not a bad product, overall."
2,not so great,"I've had this timer less than a year and though it functions well, the plastic case warped, popped open and will not remain closed now. It happened while my husband was using it on meat at the grill, despite his efforts to keep it away from prolonged high heat. At this point a metal and glass version will probably be our next purchase."
2,Read the most recent reviews - item listed is not the same item received,"The item in the picture is a model 9840, with a manual on/off switch. I have had one for years and love it. I just keep replacing the batteries.However, as of 2011, the item that was received is the model 9840N. The 9840N has two digital switches, one for on/off and other for Celcius/Fahrenheit. The problem is that these new thermometers don't work well because of defects. They look similar to the one below, but come in black.Taylor 9842 Commercial Waterproof Digital ThermometerSince these thermometers (both the model 9840 and 9842) have been around a long time, I would suggest that you read the most recent reviews to determine quality, because of apparent changes in manufacturing, and not rely on older reviews."
2,"But then, I still have an 8 track somewhere...","I received this thermometer as a stocking stuffer and initially,I was enthusiastic since I like to barbeque and the analog models I had were not instant response.Unfortunately, this unit was no improvement. It might be instant response but it was rarely accurate. In a number of instances, the variation in temperature between this unit and my old thermometers was greater than 20 degrees although calibration of each unit happened at the same time."
1,Does not work,Arrived ahead of schedule. Turned it on and all I got was LL.L instead of a temperature reading. Changed battery and no change. Would not recommend.
5,Wonderful! Worked great!,I bought this for the Thanksgiving turkey and it worked great. It was fast and easy. I also liked the protective cover which was included with it.
2,disappointing,"I thought instant read was just that - instant. NOPE. You'll need to wait a minute or so which is disappointing if you need to take something out of the oven or you're letting the heat out, etc"
1,Acurate but cheap,This thermometer worked ok until I accidentally dropped it on the floor. The case opened up and it never quite recovered. I think that I expected a little more durability.
2,Didn't last long,"Purchased this item after numerous failures with remote meat thermometers. This model worked well for 3 months, then I pulled it out of the drawer one day and it was dead. New battery didn't help, and now I've gone back to analog."
2,Returned defective,"I just recently received mine, and it was defective. Bonus points for including a replacement battery, but that didn't solve the problem. I opted to replace it with the waterproof version for $2 more."
3,Kind of slow,"I was a little disappointed with how long it took for the ""instant"" read thermometer to get the temperature. Also the literature says to insert probe 1 inch. Kind of defeats the purpose for thinner steaks and pork chops."
1,Major piece of junk!!,Don't waste you money - the thermometer didn't last - replaced the battery because it stopped working - then just fell apart :(looking for a replacement
1,On switch died in less than two weeks,"The ""on"" switch stopped working within two weeks, during which the item was used about three times.Garbage."
3,Good - until you need service,"I've had my thermometer about 3 years. It has been faithful, but I have on several occasions forgotten to shut it off when done with it, and it does not have an auto shut-off, which the higher price models have. I now need to replace the battery and have contacted more than 20 distributors of the thermometer and NONE of them sell the battery. The best answer I got was &quot;buy a new thermometer, batteries are not available&quot;. I have now sent a message to the manufacturer, taylorusa.com (who has a very poor webpage) and am hoping for a reply - so far, nothing. I cant see the purpose of buying a good thermometer with a replaceable battery if you have to throw it away because batteries are not available."
5,This is an INSTANT-READ Thermometer,"To the person that ""used this the first time in a 20 lb turkey, inside a roasting bag,"" learn how to use an ""instant read"" thermometer. It is meant to be placed into the meat, read a few seconds later, and removed. You do this when you think the meat is nearly done. It is NOT meant to be placed in the meat at the beginning of cooking and left there for the entire process."
2,Nothing 'Instant' About It,"This item is ill-named, to say the least. You'll wait at least a minute before this thermometer delivers its 'instant' reading. Pay more and get a truly instant thermometer."
3,Not instant,"I purchased this item to replace an analog ""instant"" thermometer. But this also does not give the final result for several seconds and thus I still do not consider it ""instant""."
2,Don't forget to turn it off,The thermometer works well and I think the battery would last a long time.... unless you forget to turn it off. Replacing the battery is such a hassle that I am now looking to replace the thermometer with an auto off type rather than replace the battery on this one.
1,"Got wet, broke","At no point was I particularly impressed with this little device. It feels flimsy, it can be difficult to actually press some of the buttons, it's not very fast, etc. and then it broke. I turned it off, washed it off, and then it never worked correctly again. Much preferRT600C Super-fast Water-resistant Digital Pocket Thermometer"
2,very poor construction,"This thermometer sort of works... I think I got a dud, as when it's measuring in F the LCD is so weak as to be unreadable. If I measure in C, it's fine. Sounds like an electrical problem of some sort, but it attests to the very poor build quality of this product. It's just not worth it... the other thermometers I've purchased that are $5-10 more are vastly superior and calibratable, too."
1,Don't waste your money,"The thermometer didn't work when I bought it, so I thought maybe the original battery was old or I hadn't used it quickly enough. So I put the spare battery in. Nothing. I'll never buy a Taylor product again."
1,Useless quality control,I bought one of these and it worked for 17 minutes and then died. Replacing the battery had no effect. Not really a great advertisement for their quality control...
5,Excellent all around!,Great product! Don't know how I ever cooked and lived without this. Temps display pretty fast and accurate to 1/10th of a degree. Nice easy display to read. When not in use the probe slides back into it's holster so it doesn't scratch or get damaged. It's the right price and highly recommended!
1,Get one with auto off,"This one is doesn't work when it gets hot or wet (and where do you use YOUR thermometer?).Also, it is very easy to leave it ""on"" draining the batteries. Replacement batteries cost nearly as much as the thermometer itself.I have another Taylor (unfortunately, there is no model number on it). It is auto off and saves the MAX and MIN temperatures. The MAX is helpful when I want to check I steak on my HOT! grill. I can hold the thermometer with a pair of thongs without burning my hands.This one is just plain useless."
4,Keep it in your apron pocket!,"I'm actually writing about a thermometer???? I like this little gadget. The instant read isn't really ""instant"" it takes some getting used to to know when the actual temperature is right. The first battery I put in was defective and the scale went all over the place, replaced the battery and it worked fine. Good thing it came with a spare. This comes with a little tube to keep the thermometer in and it clips to your apron pocket....now if I knew where I put the apron....also, make sure you take it out of the pocket before you wash the apron, I don't think this will survive the washing machine. I did notice that the little switch appears to be fragile, but I haven't had any problems yet. I just don't know how often this will get used, given my ""cook till it looks right"" philosophy. Makes me feel professional to have it though."
3,Good for the price,"After being frustrated with several metal/glass thermometers that took forever to read and were untrustworthy, I bought this one. It's not 'instant-read', although it climbs relatively quickly (compared to others) per partial degree. I had no problem with the switch, although you have to remember to turn it off when you're done using it.My only real gripe is that you can't get the plastic LED portion wet. Having wet hands alone (while washing it) caused enough water to get inside and disrupt the readout function. After drying out a day, it worked perfectly fine again.I'm waiting for the day that someone designs one that can be thrown in the dishwasher and is almost instant read. They do that and I would pay double what I paid for this one!"
3,3.5 stars - oddball EP from an oddball band,"Bedlam is the 2006 EP release from the now-defunct Finnish metal band Twilightning, who had a hard to classify sound that was somewhere between power metal and hair metal. Equal parts Brainstorm and Pink Cream 69, Twilightning's quirky sound won't satisfy everyone. It's interesting though, and for the most part it works. There are only five songs here, and they're all pretty solid.It's not an essential release by any means, but if you're a fan of the band - especially the sound they had going onSwinelords- Bedlam is worth checking out, though it is a bit pricey these days."
3,no container,"This was completely different than what I thought it would be. I thought it would of came in a container instead of just one envelope. It is being stuffed in a stocking instead of being a ""presents"""
4,Lots of fun for a short lived pet,Very simple kit everything you need (except for the tank and water) to grow triops. You need to follow the directions very carefully for hatching but once they start to grow they grow fast!! Very cool to watch.
1,3 Triop eggs Hatching only 2,My triops hatched and they are pretty cool so far but I did not get your typical 30 hatchlings... I only received 3 eggs!!!! And only 2 hatched...
1,not worth the cost,"This is just a packet of supplies - no container included. I should have returned but we decided to go ahead and try it for a science project. Well, you have to put crushed carrot in the bottom. Only 2 hatched and they didn't live very long. Just too much work when you can get sea monkeys - with everything including a plastic tank for them. Sea monkeys are SOOO easy to keep alive."
2,No Hatchlings!,"It didn't work for me, i tried 3 separate times 2 of which i followed the instructions to the word. I have never grown these creatures before so it is possible that they did not work because of my own ineptitude. nevertheless, I am out 10 bucks and have not Triops to show for it."
1,VERY SAD!,I bought this from here and that never showed up nor did they refund me my money a total waste of time. But i did buy these from other stores like wal-mart and mail-order and got alot more for my money and they lived three months(their lifespand) for not living long there cool just keep soil on the bottom of your tank ( I used a small aquarium kit at walmart that only holds 1 gallon of water. It has a light with it too so i didnt need to have anything else but a thermometer.(wich they come with) I loved it and it was so fun and when you use soil/sand on the bottom you get eggs (like sea-monkeys) And dry for a month the soil and volia babies! Do research if want them to live!
1,Package contained no viable eggs,"I was very disappointed by this product. It arrived in a timely manner, and contained the expected food packet and egg container. The egg container was expected to contain a mixture of very small triops eggs mixed in with detritus. What is troubling is that the egg container held only the detritus and no eggs.I am very familiar with the eggs of related branchiopods such as artemia. No eggs of any kind could be found in this package. I set up the hatching container and poured the detritus mixture in anyway. After a week in recommended hatching conditions, no tiny triops naupilae could be found, living or dead. I therefore concluded that this package contained no viable eggs, if it contained any at all. A call to the company requesting warranty clarifications was never returned."
4,Great educational toy!,"Though we set up the kit exactly as in the manual, we only hatched one Triop and he lived for about a week. The company is great to deal with and are sending us another kit. We've had Triops before and they grew quite large and we had almost a dozen hatch, so this kit was not a good one. Hopefully the next kit will work. Triops are cute and fun to watch and teach kids responsibility."
4,This things are awesome,"I enjoyed the Triops while they were alive. I tried changing the water and I guess I did something wrong because soon they were all dead...I would like to try again, overall its a good product though."
2,poorly made and cheap looking,i ordered this bag based on review and can't say i agree. it is very cheaply made with not one storage pocket (where i put my dog's leash when i'm toting her) my chihuahua who is a bit oversized (not fat) could not lie down and there is no comfortable way for her head to stick out (something she insists on). the color is overly bright. i returned it.
5,It's a great book for both beginner and expert singers,"I really enjoyed singing songs from this book. It has a collection of songs from operas such as ""Carmen"", ""Madama Butterfly"", ""La Boheme"" and many others. They come in a variety of languages. It has songs that work for pretty much any level of voice-- from beginners to experts. It contains songs such as ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" and ""The Willow"". It is definately worth getting if you are an opera fan!"
4,Great First Book for Learning Opera Arias,"I like this book because it not only contains the familiar arias from the famous Operas, but also good pieces from some not so familiar ones. It gives the beginner a broader choice of music and allows for expanding your repetoire. Easy to read and easy to learn. Good book!"
3,Definitely for the More Advanced Soprano Vocalist,"Next time, I'll check the titles of the songs more closely. I already have many of these arias in my old copy of Schirmer's Arias for Coloratura Sopranos. I was looking for something that had more arias for the beginner-intermediate level soprano. This is a good book for the more advanced soprano particularly coloratura's, however."
1,Dissatisfied amazon.com potential customer,I wish amazon.com would list the contents of books like this one under their book info heading. It's most frustrating for customers like me who are looking for a specific aria. It would be most helpful if the arias were listed the same way as on a CD. Hopefully this suggestion will be taken up and approved. I did not purchase this book for the above reason.
4,Great Twist On Metal,"I picked this up because I loved the Pagan cover. The music was another surprise as I was not sure what to expect. I'd never heard of these people until I saw several of their CD's in the closing of Tower Records.The music is very Irish and folky, yet still full of metal. I have several of the melodies dancing around in my head right now as I write this. I love their use of traditional instruments, particularly, the Shawm (I think it's called that). Overall, the album has a great feel to it.My only criticism is the harsh vocals. The male voice is good in most places but when he is singing harsh, it just sounds too grating and is too much of a contrast to the rest of the music.These guys and girl remind me of Goat Of Mendes, and that is not a bad thing. I like their twist on metal and strongly recommend it. Dance an Irish jig!"
4,Great for fans of Swedish Viking Rock,"For those into Sweden's ""Viking"" Rock scene- ie Ultima Thule, Rode Orm and, especially Hel, this CD is worth checking out. Imagine a melodic ""Death"" metal version of Jethro Tull! Great songs like ""some say the devil is dead"", ""Viking slayer"" and ""fall of Gondolin"". Unfortunately, there are a couple of drawbacks that detrack from the enjoyment: the title track is a sick attack on Christianity worse than anything Marylin Manson has done (more venom than Venom!) while ""Michael Collins"" shows the band's sympathy to the IRA! However, if you skip over those two mistakes you got a good CD."
5,OKAY BUD...COME OUT COME OUT WHERE EVER U ARE!!!!,"I absolutely love Lisa Marie Rice's ""Midnight"" series! The second in the series is probably the Hottest if your looking for romance and you know......:) Bud and Clare burned up the sheets! I just have one question...where are all the Bud's???? Well I guess thats why we read these books!!! Fun, romantic, and stupid because of it being so unrealistic ( A man that can go ""all"" night and I mean ""all"" night!!) but hey...thats what makes it so appealing, escaping for a few hours from ""real"" life. Highly recommend!!"
4,"Not quite as good as the first in the series, but...","Midnight Run wasn't as good as the first in the series (Midnight Man), but came close. The erotica wasn't quite as well-written, but the relationship and romantic tension between the two main characters was better developed than in the first book. The main problem was with the ending - the resolution took just a couple of pages, and then the story ended. I've read at least three books by Rice and this is a problem with every one of them. It's always jarring because her endings are too abrupt. Otherwise, she does a good job in this genre (romantica/erotica)."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased Midnight Man, Midnight Run, & Midnight Angel at the same time after hearing rave reviews from friends. BIG MISTAKE! I through 44% of the book before any actual plot formed. I have nothing against sex in books, but I prefer some plot too.The second book in the series was a little better, but not much with most of the plot forming within the last third of the novel... And I haven't decided if I'm even going to bother with the third."
5,LMR Does it again!!,"So many times a sequal is not as good as the 1st, but this book did not disappoint.Bud is a hot alpha male and Claire is the perfect beautiful counterpart. A very heartwarming emotional read. It is nice to read a story with a great balance of suspense and hot chemistry."
4,Very cool and difficult game.,"You are an Apache helicopter pilot, on 30 missions into 5 levels of Desert Storm! This is a pretty nice game, with an overhead view of the helicopter and land, making it not for everyone, especially anyone under 13, because of its intense difficulty. You must follow the missions anywhere from destroying enemy radars / airports (with guns, hydras and heckfire missiles) to capturing commanders and saving hostages all from your apache helicopter. There is pretty good gameplay, however just one helicopter, if you get destroyed, thats it, so you collect hostages and drop them off to replenish your copter's armor."
4,Who doesn't like explosions!,"Who doesn't like to go flying around in a helicopter armed to the gills with rockets and blow stuff up? This game has a nice combination of several features, including: great 3D graphics, a wide variety of enemy units, cool scenery, missions to complete, easy and fun game play. No matter how many times I play this game, I can always play it more, because it is very fun.The downside. It's very easy to beat once you get the knack of it, and it has only 4 levels. Should you aquire the right pilot, it is possible to blast your enemies from a distance that you are incapable of being detected.But, hey, what did you want? There is not much to say about this game except it is pointless fun."
4,Great tool with some tweeking,"This makes removing popcorn ceiings much easier on the shoulders and arms. You do have to empty the trash bag frequently as the wet popcorn gets heavy. We decided to tweek the tool, however. I found that the sharp corners tended to gouge the ceiling. We used a grinder to round off the corners and no longer had that problem. Perhaps the manufacturer should hear this suggestion."
2,Save your money...,"This tool works however the job can be done much quicker by using simple putty knifes to remove old popcorn ceiling. The bag that is supposed to ""catch"" any mess doesn't work that effectively. I bought this tool and ended up not using it after only 2 minutes. Save your money and buy a putty knife for a 10th of the cost."
2,A good idea but too flimsy!,"This tool is a good idea, in fact I went one better by attaching my wide shop vac head beneath the scraper instead of using a bag setup. However, as wide as the blade is, the support bracket is too thin and of a low grade steel. So if you exert enough pressure on the blade to get a good clean scrape on the ceiling, the handle ends up bending until it is unusable. I helped this some by cutting an inch off each side of the blade, making it around 5 inches wide. So now less pressure is needed and the bracket does handle the pressure as long as you are delicate with it. I've done 2 small bedrooms and now the blade needs sharpened because it is also a low grade steel. I wish this tool was made with better quality so I could give it a higher rating. The Kobalt 3 1/4"" pole scraper works GREAT and is a well designed, tough tool, but is just too narrow for this job."
2,Disappointing,"Bought product on recommendation of a plastering professional. Product didn't work, I was actually bending the handle trying to scrape the popcorn off of my ceiling. It took me about 6 hours to scrape an average sized bedroom and I ended up scraping the ceiling to the original sheet rock. I couldn't just scrape the popcorn. I ended up using a simple hand scraper which was much more effective."
4,popcorn ceiling.....goodby!,"This product is great! Really a time saver. I used a pump up sprayer to dampen the ceiling first, 4 x 4 area was best then dumped it in a plastic tote. Everything was dumped in the mulch pile to mix with oak leaves. The plastic bag attached meant almost no clean up......"
3,ceiling texture scraper,I havent rated it very high because I havent used it yet. Otherwise it is as described and appears to be sturdy.
2,The decent thumbnail reference on post-WWII missiles.,"Best described as a cross between a Jane's reference and a coffee table book, IEotWR&M contains at least some info on every single missile program of any significance. Most photos aren't that great, and there is very little original art work from the '79 edition, but its still a good resource for the rocket enthusiast."
1,Don't bother,"I should have listened to the negative reviews. It is tough to describe these pajamas, but trust me, you would never wear them. The top and bottom, though both were labeled the same size, they were very disproportionate.The material has a weird plastic like feel. Pass on these folks. They are not worth your time or money."
2,Size is not correct,"I bought this top and the material was very nice. But the size was way wrong. My husband has refused to wear it as the top is huge. I was going to return it, but when I notified Amazon, they said there wasn't anything wrong with it and I would have to pay the postage to send it back. Therefore, it sits in the drawer along with the pants (the pants fit fine, but my husband won't wear them without a top to go with it). I will never, never buy anything from Amazon again based on my first time experience with them. I don't have anything good to say about them. Service is 0!"
1,"I like the picture, but the top I received is not at all like that one.","The picture of the pajama top has two pockets, at the hip, and a straight hem around the bottom. The one they sent me has one pocket (on the chest), and has a regular ""shirt tails"" hem, like the one you find on a dress shirt, except it falls almost down to my knees. Maybe this was just a mistake, but I am returning it. It looks like maternity wear or something. On a more positive note, the fabric feels nice. I will try and find out why I didn't receive the same shirt as the picture, and get it exchanged, but there wasn't an e-mail address provided with the order, so I am just frustrated and annoyed."
4,nice pj top,My wife like the silky feel and the shirt is well made. It is sized right. It fits tight around my wrist but not so bad. but then again I have arms that are thick. So if you are built that way expect the wrist and arms to fit a little tight. ( My wife like that though )This pj top is worth your money.
2,"Nice, but huge.","I'm 145lbs, 5'9"". I usually wear size Small because it fits well.This size small fit my roommate, 190 lbs, 5'8"", broad shoulders, with room to spare. It's gigantic. The pants fit fine, but this thing is way out of proportion.The material is nice and soft, though, and if it fit this item would definitely get 5 stars."
4,The best journal I ever read.,"I thought the book was very good. I think that the year in which the story takes place (1943) is a little hard for the children to grasp. Kids in the year 1999, would like it if they had more journals in there time, not more than 50 years ago. The best part in the book was the end, when Mrs. Leitstein gets married to a man she met in Texas while she was there for short visit. I loved it when Katie got excited when asked to be the bridesmaid!! Another is when Katie's mom gets hit by a truck. The accident brought her closer to her mom than she ever was before. After that she stopped writing about her mom and how annoying and mean she was. Her mom never let her wear lipstick, but after the accident Katie's mom actually let her wear lipstick and Katie felt much better!! I liked the meaning behind the story. We should appreciate our parents always, even when they make us do things we don't like."
5,Something like a parable...,"This unique picture book tackles one of society's most menacing things: the gang. A young boy is approached by a tiger (the gang), and is asked to hop on (join the gang). Once he's riding, the boy is excited and can't believe the tiger has such an interest in HIM, a 10 year old. Then he learns the darker side of being on the tiger, and wants to get off. The tiger does not make it easy, but in the end, the tiger loses a potential member. The bold, striking woodcuts accentuate the text, and deftly portray the scenes the text describes. This book opens up many avenues for discussion with parents, teachers, and (older) children, especially children who are not exposed to gangs on a regular basis."
1,The book is just as horrific as the test,"From a student's perspective, the book isn't very helpful. Most people use it to review right before taking the test to get a general feel for how they would do. If your looking for a book that will help you review material, this isn't it...it's just two tests that are honestly not anything like the real thing. If you want my advice, stay away from the U.S. Subject test altogether- it's awful :("
2,SAT History Subject Test Study Guide,"I bought this for my son to prepare for the SAT II in U.S. history. However, he did not find this book helpful, and I had to buy him a different book which gave a concise summary of U.S. history. He found the second book to be much more pertinent for preparing him for the test."
2,Mehh,"This review book was remarkably thin, and if your reviewing for the subject test your better off with the AMSCO book or taking practice tests from SPARKNOTES. I ended up getting a 750 w/o even using this -.- so MEHHHHHH"
3,Math Tests are NOT Accurate,"If you are planning on taking multiple Subject tests, then this is a cost efficient book. However, if you are only taking the Math test, please know that the test(s) in this book are far too easy compared to the real thing.If you are looking for a book that is accurate in difficulty, then try the Barron's book, but be forewarned that it is more difficult and comprehensive than the real test."
1,Glass cover cracked in the oven the first time I used it,Baked our turkey with it. Cracked in the oven the first time we used it.
4,Great Value,I purchased this item as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Great value for the price.The large dial enables you to see the temperature thru the glass in the oven door without having to open it.
1,20 degrees off!,"Thermometers are not always accurate. I'm glad I tested mine before using it. It is 20 degrees off! Water boils at 212F, but my thermometer read 190 degrees. Even after leaving the thermometer in the boiling water for a couple of minutes, it did not get past 192 degrees. I was expecting it to be a little off, but 20 degrees? That's a little obnoxious. I will be replacing this thermometer as quickly as possible. I'm sorry I wasted the money."
5,At last a Thermometer that works,"After years of sticking in three thermometers and taking the average, this one works right every time! One would not expect such a great item for such a great price!Taylor Classic Style Meat Dial Thermometer"
1,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!,"I ordered this thermometer because it stated in the description that it was safe to use in the dishwasher. However, upon arrival - I see that the packaging clearly states, ""Do not immerse thermometer in water. Not for use in dishwashers. Clean stem with hot soapy water and wipe head with damp cloth. A scouring pad can be used to remove grease.""I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
4,Good Thermostat,I smoke meat and use this. It works great. Just be sure not to push on the glass too hard while your cleaning it because water gets in. If the seal was better it would get 5 stars.
2,taylor classic style meat dial trhermometer,"wife have trouble getting it to read correct and had to use another device. I don.t know if calculation was correct or she did not understand the way it displayed. however, did not do the job for her"
5,Taylor Thermometer,"I like to cook but the only time my wife usually let's me is during Thanksgiving. The reason is simply, the turkey is too heavy for her to lift. This Taylor thermometer is excellent because it's easy to read, simple to use and is very accurate. In addition, the theremometer has a red sliding temperature gauge that permits the cook to pre-set the ultimate temperature desired. When the final, desired temperature is reached, the cook easily sees the cooking needle at the spot as the red, pre-set gauge. This makes it easy for the cook to cook at the correct temperature. I have used this Taylor thermometer for over ten years. It is well built,simple to use, lasts, is easy to read and is accurate. What more can any cook desire?"
1,DO not buy this product,"I purchased the unit just before thanksgiving and it worked fine, wiped it off put it in the drawer and went to use it a 2nd time and id never registered any temperature on the guage. Would not purchase from the vendor again."
1,Good while it lasted,"I bought this in October 2007 and used it a total of three times... it worked well when I used it but unfortunately, stopped working. I noticed the last time I used it there was water in the display after washing it by hand."
3,Caution,"This thermometer works very well, I'm a bonehead when it comes to the BBQ and manage to overcook everything. I love the adjustable dial that allows for quick reference to temperature and it hasn't failed me yet. Problem; the Amazon item overview states that it ""is dishwasher safe"". Not so, my wife popped it into the dishwasher last night and it filled with soapy water. Reading the cleaning care instructions that comes with it, it clearly states ""Not for use in dishwashers""."
2,Disappointed in the dishwasher,"Product says it's dishwasher safe - worked great in oven, put in dishwasher and it came out with water under the face. We tilted it on a paper towel and it did drain, we used it again and it did still work. So product good - just not really dishwasher safe - which is why we picked this one over other products."
1,jayx,While the unit ordered was TAYLOR it showed by TEMPRITE.Unit failed after second use by the dial freezing at 160 regardless of whether in the oven or at room tmeperature.
1,Not Refurbished As Advertised,This meat thermometer was advertised as refurbished. In fact it arrived in torn up packaging and the dial fell off when I took it out of the package.
2,"meh, not impressed",i've used the thermometer a couple of times now and it takes forever to read the proper temp of the meat. It will take several minutes to actually read the meat temperature.
5,A fun gem to behold,"This is a really fun game for those that want a more ""relaxed"" RPG. It reminds me of zelda somewhat. You jump around on platforms and solve puzzels. The hard puzzles have to do with math. This is one of the few times that RPG's actually make you mess with exact numbers and odd numbers. It's very fast paced, and if you are just starting to play RPG's, i recommend this one. The time it takes to beat will be too short for hard core RPG's, but it is still fun. I enjoyed it very much."
1,"Old news, not good news",This is an older book that in no way represents the new diets for diabetics. Using the old ADA diet is not a way for most diabetics to prevent high blood sugars or other problems that can happen down the line. The new diets for diabetics using low-carb diets is very important. American people did not get fat eating low carb but did do so eating a diet much like the ADA high carb diets. Even the ADA is in process of preparing a new diet guidline based upon low carb diets and not an exchange program.
2,Catchy music,"So this game sucks. THe only good things about it are the music when you are playing (which is ghetto but awesome), and the fact that you can run into impossibly strong panther heads that shoot lasers from their eyes. Seriously, don't waste more than like $1 or 2 on this game.."
3,Takes some getting-used to,"It took me quite some time to get used to all the different control icons. The only way I got ahead a few levels was by letting my characters be invisible. What I don't like is that you can aquire all kinds of equipment, but you don't have enough space to keep it all. Also I'm having a hard time finding my way around on the world map. I continuously seem to wander around in circles. So this is not one of my favorite games."
3,Good instruction - Poor timing,"I'm a massage therapist and I bought this for my wife so she could work on me. It's filled with solid instruction, but they sold themselves short; this could have easily been a 90 minute video if they didn't move so fast. This can be solved by pausing, but then you lose the music and you end up with an oiled remove if you don't first cover it with a sandwich bag."
2,Just ok,"I was expecting much more from the description and the cover. I guess it just proves, you can't judge a book (or a dvd) by it's cover..."
2,"Crude, but cheap","No comparison with DMT or EZE Lap, but the price is right. Useful only for very rough sharpening (hoes and shovels, say, not knives or axes)."
5,The Best Nails For Paslode Guns,"I'm very happy with these nails. I've used them in a number of sizes over a period of a few months and after a few thousand nails I only think I've had two or three get jammed and that's always been when I had two or three sections of broken nails in the gun (by broken, I mean that the stick of nails was no longer glued together like they come from the factory - due to my mishandling, not shipping).I used these in the Paslode 16ga cordless trim nailer (straight) on an outdoor project and after five months outside only about 200 yards from salt water I don't see any rust, so the galvanized coating must be very high quality. This is in raw cypress with no paint or finish applied afterwards.Overall great nails and I'll always use Paslode nails in my Paslode Nail Guns (which I'm thrilled with too!)"
3,nails ok shipping sucks,"The nails are regular paslode nails. It's the shipping. Amazon, after two shipments can not figure out that if you pack the box wrong, the nails break. If they sold the nails in the cardboard box instead of the plastic box it would help."
3,Cardio Belt,This worked as a replacement for my Polar T31 however the clip that holds the belt are not as secure as that of the Polar.
2,"problems, problems","The pulse function has worked for a while but not for very long, and I am stuck now with with an unsatisfactory pulse meter. I am sorry I bothered with it."
2,Not US Made,"Disappointed .. Manufactured in US, but a product of China :( They are beef, chicken flavored, so might be OK ??"
5,My baby loves the massages!,"I started this DVD when my son was about a month old, and he loved it right from the start! It isn't a big commitment bc you don't need to give the baby a full body massage all in one sitting (and actually, they recommend against that bc it is too long). It is surprisingly easy to fit into the daily routine, even though I have a toddler at home to keep me busy too! For example, during a diaper change when you have spare time, you can give baby a leg and foot massage. Then a back massage before bed. I am very glad that I bought this DVD..and so is my baby!!!"
5,i love it,i have spot the video game nes and have one more spot this hard one spot goes to hollywood got pass frist level 2 indiana jones this hard one al might do a run hollywood play it off camrom
4,"7 UP, great drink and video game","While this game was really just one massive promotion project for 7UP, its also a really awesome game. The graphics are great, good level designs, and fun gameplay. Nonetheless; there are a lot of 7UP references you blast 7UP bubbles as your weapon, you collect 7UP icons for bonus points, you drink 7UP for extra health, and in the bonus stage your inside a massive 7UP bottle and collect all kinds of goodies. There are no bosses, but thats cool you fight a lot of enemies through out the game and trying to locate all the cool points is diffcult enough. This game was also ported for the Sega Genesis, there is very little difference. Some of the graphics are a little better on Genesis, but some of the enemies look better on SNES. Overall good game."
3,Controversial Allegations Raise Questions in This ' History',"This rather odd combination of fiction and history is fascinating reading but raises questions about its sources and reliability. The allegations concerning Collins' relations with various women and the fallout from them in the Treaty negotiations is one area in which allegations go beyond any I've read elsewhere. Even more important are the allegations that Collins was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy between members of his own government (particularly Kevin O'Higgins, Emmet Dalton and William Cosgrave)and the British and that members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (Collins' main base of power) were involved on all sides. These contentions fly in the face of much that has been written about Collins and are not documented in any of the usual ways, thus raising questions about their reliability in the reader's mind."
1,Buy something else,"I love a good collection of Christmas stories. I usually get a book of this type every year around mid December to read. It doesn't always have to be one of those ""make you feel good"" books or ""Its a Wonderful Life"" type of story. I loved Skipping Christmas, the Time Piece, the Christmas Box (I think that was the name of it). Christmas in the South is a wonderful collection of short stories from Southern writers, but they have little or nothing to do with Christmas or even winter for that matter. Many of the short stories, like those you read in High School and College, leave you confused at the end and are worthy of group discussions to figure out exactly what (if anything) the writer was wanting to tell us. I will not be buying or even borrowing its sequel. I wish I had used the money I had spent on it to buy some other Christmas story."
4,It takes a poet to translate poetry.,"An enchanting little book well worth its weight in shipping costs. It's always good to read a poet's translation, and few people out there today read or write poetry as well as Bly. Getting to watch Bly collaborate with poets like Lorca through translation is a rare experience. While the true joy of the book is in Bly's translations and selections of poetry, his scattered arguments for what he calls 'leaping poetry' are no less insightful and are a testament to the power of poetic argument. A wonderful and worthwhile read for any modern poetry lovers. Some knowledge of Spanish would greatly enhance the reading--and any poetry hounds with such knowledge MUST buy this--but it is not required."
3,Mixed bag,"Like another reviewer pointed out, this doesn't hold shapes very well. You may be able to write with it, but that's it.However, the taste is preferable to the canned icing you get at the grocery store, and is easy to make. It's great to cover a cake with, provided you use buttercream icing for the designs or top it with fruit, like the picture on the box displays.Also, this is WAY overpriced to buy on Amazon. Micheal's sells this for about five dollars, whereas Amazon's asking anywhere from eight to ten."
3,"great taste, difficult to decorate with","I recently purchased 2 boxes of this. I LOVE the bettercreme icing used in stores, and figured this would be close. The flavor was tremendous! Unfortunatley, it was extremely difficult to use for anything but spreading on the cake. Cake wound up being very good in spite of the icing oops'!"
3,Sounds good... but curious about two things...,"So, the ingredients in the product sound great, with corn oil, and tea tree oil as the cleaning agents. It sprays on easily, and has a nice scent, but two things about this product still make me curious:1) The directions don't state anywhere whether or not this is a ""spray and forget it"" product, or a ""spray and wipe"" product. For now, I've been spraying, and just leaving it on the tiles.2) Using this product causes my air purifier to turn onto max power after a minute or so, as something in its smell it doesn't like. Now, this DOESN'T happen when I used the ""Seventh Generation"" shower cleaner, another good for nature product, so I wonder whether or not there is anything bad in this product that's triggering the air purifier.After my initial bottle runs out I may just stick with the Seventh Generation product, as it's cheaper, and doesn't cause the air purifier to go crazy after using it. (which also eats electricity)"
3,The game itself,the controls were weird and not enough lives but it came in great condition so this one is not worth it but the shipping was well done
1,Worse than bad,"This book has the worst description of the OSI model that I've ever had the misfortune to read, and I've seen a few.I am seriously considering dropping a network class for the sole reason that it uses this book as the text book.In all fairness, I should mention that I've only read one chapter. That's all I'm likely to read."
5,A most satisfying resurrection,"Jeff Rovin's ""roman a cinema"" is a great read for several reasons -- it's obviously written by someone who deeply loves the old Universal horror classics, and who delights in salting the text with sly references and in-jokes (e.g., ""Strickfaden batteries"", named after Kenneth Strickfaden, who created the original lab equipment for ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride Of Frankenstein""). I'm such a junkie for anything having to do with those old movies that, even if the book were no more than that, I'd consider it worth the money. But wait -- there's more! ""Return of the Wolfman"" is also an exploration of the tragic character of Larry Talbot, a decent man cursed to live forever, killing every full moon. His search for death's release, his honor and his determination to protect the world from the evil of Count Dracula, are the real meat of the book, and raise it perilously close to the level of literature. I can't wait for the sequel."
1,TRIPE,"I had to force myself to finish this one. Good idea, bad execution. I can't believe anyone would buy this for $18.00 as shown above."
4,"Wolfie, Frankie & Drac are Back!","The Universal horror classic movie that fans have been dying for is, at long last ... a book! Fifty years after ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, werewolf Lawrence Talbot, the Frankenstein Monster, and Count Dracula are all revived in Rovin's fast-paced, gore-drenched chiller. The level of graphic violence in the story was never depicted in the classic Universal Pictures horror films, and at times seems out of place. Also, having the Monster actually 8-feet tall is a tad ludicrous, but does make for some interesting shennanigans! Rovin captures Lawrence Talbot perfectly, and creates some interesting characters for the book's contemporary sequences. His handling of Dracula doesn't quite ring true, though. The book's ending sets up the inherent sequel, but where is it?"
5,They're baaaack!,This book is a classic for anyone that loves the classic Universal Monsters. Rovin's use of obscure names and incidents from other Universal films (horror as well as Abbott and Costello) is a wonderful trip down trivia lane.He seamlessly picks up the story at the end of the monsters last film appearance in A and C meet Frankenstein and brings us up to date. The horror is played straight and there are surprises around each corner. Highly recommended.
4,Fun homage,"Corny, but I liked it a lot. Also like Harry Shannon's wonderful 2003 novel ""Night of the Werewolf,"" 'Return of the WOlf Man' is a fun homage to the genre packed with inside jokes (Shannon's terrifying romp uses the names of horror authors as characters, Jeff Rovin features the people in and around the great Universal monster films as characters). Worth tracking down."
1,extremely terrible graphic novel,"I bought this title based on the positive reviews about kevin smith's work. Unfortunately, the story and graphic novel was extremely boring and lame. there is no comparision to frank miller's eighties work in terms of intensity and impact. Frank Miller was brilliant because there was a cleverness to the words and the impact in emotional thought to Daredevil or Batman in Miller's work. THe christian theme was extremely ineffective and the drawing, which was pretty good, was destroyed by the terrible coloring. It was too dark and I dont mean the story. As a very picky comic book reader, I would tell discerning comic readers not to spend their money on this title."
1,Not to be placed with Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns.,"In case you are wondering this is the same Kevin Smith who made Mallrats and Dogma, two very lousy films. His comic book writing is not much better. I've read better daredevil stories then this one, and the fact is sales of the DD comic have not increased because of this story. The issues were always late in shipping and the final climax is uneventful and a waste of time. Everything Marvel does these days is over-rated and getting low budget film makers to write comics is not a constructive approach either. I can not reccomand this book."
4,Smith is here to stay...,"Smith does a wonderful job reinventing the Man Without Fear. One can only wonder the spontaneity he'd bring to the film version starring Afflek (Blech!). Quesada's artwork is so over the top, and the coloring appears to be done by somebody on acid. If you're expecting the menacing an stark vision which Miller brought to this anti-hero, don't tread in these waters. Still, it's a 4 star story... and DD is back!"
3,Good But Not Great,"I've been hearing rave reviews on Kevin Smith's movies and his so-called comic book references in his movies. Now that he got his hands on writing comics, I assumed that this would be the person with the caliber of Alan Moore or Frank Miller to start such a hype among comic and movie fans alike. Well, storylinewise, it seems that Smith tried to emulate the grim and gritty approach a la Miller, yet in doing so his story tends to get hackneyed with the notion of been there and done that to the readers. It is so apparent that Smith tried to dramatize the event by cramming up his story with too many shallow subplots before pulling the plug on Karen Page.Everything in the book feels just so-so, or perhaps I was expecting too much from a writer whose reputation has gone far beyond comic book."
3,Daredevil and some Hyped up Screen writer,"The Miller daredevil, is the standard. Smith writes comics the way one would assume Miller would at age 15. Clerks was funny, Daredevil is sooooo overdramatic and the storyline dealing with a washed up villan, is just the result of a washed up writer who should stick with film and leave comics to the likes of Moore, Miller and Tomine (whom i think Smith was aiming for) the artwork is great, thats it."
3,Decent but VERY overrated,"The major problem with quality writing in comics is simply the format itself. It is a serial, and the object is to keep the buyer an addict instead of having a beginning and an ending. That said, Kevin Smith has the clout to make the most major changes and revisions to this character since Frank Miller. Unfortunately, he does this by blatantly imitating the Miller 86 ""Born Again"" story of ruining DD's life with the murder of his lover by Bullseye from Millers earlier ""Elektra"" storyline. Addding in Catholicism and a cheesy Spider Man villain. The fact that this is highly derivitive doesn't make it terrible, esp. concerning the medium, but is a not essential except to Smith's fanbase or completists. Read the Frank Miller paperback reprints of ""Visionaries 2"" or ""Born Again"" for the better originals.P.S. Karen Page deserved better than this send-off"
2,Not bad...,"but doesn't hold a stick to the Golden Era of Frank Miller's Daredevil. The story, plot and graphics were OK and if your simply looking for a few hours of escape, then this is an OK read but I wouldn't hardly recommend buying it."
5,Daredevil at its best...,"...and that pretty much sums it up, this is Daredevil at its best, a great writer like Kevin Smith coupled with the awesome talents of Joe Quesada makes this the absolute best run on Daredevil that I can remember. The story is deep and developed, art that has never been equaled on Daredevil before, and plot twists that hit from left and right. I have been buying comics for longer than I can remember and this is the run that brought me back to Daredevil, long after everyone including myself thought it a dead title. I never recomend people to certain comics, but this is something that I will recomend til the day I die. This is as good as it gets"
2,Disappointing follow-up to Rise of Apocalypse,"The game is boring and somewhat difficult to navigate. The characters don't even move their lips when they talk (how 15 years ago is that?),there are really no items to collect along the way, and the missions seem kind of pointless. It is by no means as engaging as Rise of Apocalypse, the story is kind of stupid too. The characters don't have that many powers, and there are very few features to the game. I LOVE X-MEN in general, movies, comics, the whole bit, and I hope they come up with another game in the near future that is way better than this one.I don't get how this could have happened, the game was made by the same company that made the X-men 2.Now if the movie sucks too, I'll have wasted the past 6 months waiting for both the game and the movie. Oh well."
2,Don't waste your $40,"I bought this game after seeing X3 mainly because I was curious as to what happened to Kurt in the third movie. Well, I did learn what happened to him, but wasted $40 doing it. The graphics are terrible--like anime cartoons from the 80s, only worse (in that the movement/speaking is just lacking). My boyfriend and I beat this game in 3 days, with less than 20 hours of total gameplay. I might like it more if I could play ONLY as Nightcrawler, and not have to switch characters, since he has the best moves IMO, but that's not the case. I did enjoy it while I played it, which is why I gave it 3 stars for fun. But it was over way too quickly, and I feel it was a waste of money, so it gets 2 stars overall."
2,"Good for beginners, but not an advanced piece.","As a student of ecopsychology, I picked up this work expecting to find in depth discussions about theories in psychology and ecopsychology. I was already familiar with many of the concepts discussed in this book- vision quests, psychedelics, shamanism, and the like. So in all honesty, I was not too thrilled or dazzled.If you are new to the subject, this is a good introduction. For someone studying this a while and is familiar with these concepts, I would point the readers to Ecopsychology: Restoring the Earth, Healing the Mind. The author contributes to this excellent anthology."
1,Anyone who gave this book an award never read it!,"I purchased this book on the strong recommendations of Amazon readers and I was completely fooled. There is no story in this ""story""; the book is a constant description of a small Irish town with some sparse dialog thrown in. Entire chapters of this book are completely irrevelant and should have been edited out. Save your time, read something else. Of the fifty books I have read this year, I would rate this one the worst by far."
2,Unsatisfied,According to all of the information I had from the product description I thought that I was buying a 1963 Hardcover edition. What I received was a 2003 hardcover full of black ink splotches. Fortunately it is still readable. I will think twice about doing business with the seller in the future. I did receive the book in excellent time.
5,phenomenal !,"The Black House is a phenomenal book that captures the soul of young America today. This book is a must buy! Kim Ransom is a fresh, conscious poet to keep your eye on in the Y2K!"
2,go for a newer version,"I got this one because it was ten dollars cheaper than the new editions. However, even on my modern PC, the useless 3D graphics are buggy. Sometimes my pieces would just disappear. The announcer and voices are also rather annoying and repetitive.The worst part is that due to all the animations, the game takes forever to play. The 2008 edition is much easier and faster to play, and much more fun."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I played a pc version of monopoly on Win 95 that looked and played better and smoother than this version. Very disappointed in the poor gameplay, the horrible 3D graphics and the irratating token voices. I'm going to try the 2008 version and hope for the best."
2,Not bad for kids,"Younger kids will probably like the animation and audio. Tokens are hard to see and property prices could be more easily accessible.UPDATE 26/9/10: Now that I've spent more time with it, I'm lowering my rating. The game program is simplistic: eg. offering low-rent blue property(s) to complete a computer player's set for almost any higher end one+$$$ to complete your own high-rent set (thus with the deal highly favorable to you), almost always works virtually ensuring your win. The program very annoyingly interrupts your deal-making constantly with its own often silly (eg. bargaining for a very few $$ difference or making ridiculous/meaningless offers such exchange of same-set properties which really makes no difference to any player) which is very frustrating. The program provides little challenge and you can easily end up with a win average of 90%+."
1,Sophomoric and not Useful,"I bought this book based on a review that suggested it was natural history and would give me information on swamps and bogs.What it turned out to be was a sophomoric series of essays loosely focused around the author's experiences in wetlands. There was little science, instead just a series of unrelated ramblings.It appears to be the work of student trying to impress their professor with their vast knowledge of various cultural icons.If you want to learn about wetlands, find another book. If you want to read good writing, find another book."
3,Will work with Skype...but not with Xlite or other VoIP software,Basically adds another audio playback/recording device to your PC.To really use it as a phone a software integrates it to Skype. There is a version to integrate it to Xlite but you will need a specific version of Xlite to make it workOverall a good product for the price. But...do you really need it?
2,Do not waste your money,"Almodovar style, a lot of none sense with a stupid end. Couple disgusting scenes and a lot of cursing. It leaves me the impression that Mexican producers exploit young girl's sexuality just to satisfy their own inner passions."
1,Boo!,"I've used this machine extensively in a doctor's office, and it worked well for quite some time, despite difficulty getting started. Recently though, it has been plagued by problems, most specifically phantom paper jams which don't actually exist but cause the whole thing to stop working. I've had to take it in for repairs at least three times, but have owned it for only about a year. Also, it sometimes refuses to recognize the toner cartridge, also causing a complete breakdown of function. If you want a reliable machine, I suggest you look somewhere else!"
1,Very poor copy of a Street Fighter II game,"Take a trip far away from brawling on the streets to a cartoonish Street Fighter II rip off. This is a very poor game, first because it took you away from the past familiar faces of the Double Dragon games and replaced them with the characters from the cartoon series! Then, it puts you into a non random five person ladder tournament where you win a match and you continue working your way up to the Shadow Boss."
3,Not as good as Super Street Fighter II Turbo. However . . .,"Street Fighter rip-offs seem to get a bad rep: video games like Fatal Fury, Fighters History, Kat Fight, and TMNT Tournament Fighters have gotten mostly bad reviews , this being one of them.Double Dragon 5 is essentially a tournament fighting game based on a short-lived cartoon series that aired around the early-to-mid 1990's. I guess you could say it's a game based on a cartoon based on a game. The animation is a bit shabby and the moves are not very easy to pull off. I really don't know what else to write about this game.Street Fighter 2 set the bar at a level few fighting games were able to reach - notable exceptions include Mortal Kombat 1&2 and the Japanese Super Famicom Dragon Ball Z series. As a result, more recent fighting games such as Eternal Champions and Double Dragon V have become underrated."
5,The Man Within,"I've read all of the books in this series and I enjoyed how the stories build and build from one life to another. I have a kindle now and I'm reading the series again. I have some of the books, but I've given some away. If you enjoy romance and action, by all means, read this series."
5,The Man Within,"Wonderful writing, makes you feel part of the story! I completely enjoyed reading this book, and would think everyone would! I love the Lora Leigh Breed stories, I think most people who enjoy paranormal book would like these too. They are NOT shifters, but genetic creation. Very interesting series!"
3,I guess it's ok,"I ordered the two first in this series together based on recommendations from a friend. I have to say, I was very dissapointed. Although there is a plot in this story, it is almost completely buried under the massive amount of sex-scenes, it wasn't quite as bad as in the first book, but still far to much in my opinion.Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy a good sex scene in my stories, but here the rest of the book just seemed to be filling around the sex. The caracters were uninteresting underdeveloped and utterly unengaging. In the end I found myself so bored that I never finished the story.I will neither recommend this book to others nor buy more from this author."
5,HOT,"If you are familiar with the Feline Breeds by Lora Leigh, this is, in my opinion the best of the lot. I'm not sure if this would be in the paranormal CATagory or Sci-fi. If women's erotica offends you, stay away from this book."
2,cheap cheap cheap copy,This (new) book appears to be an extremely poor photocopy of the prior issue of the same book. The pages are not centered and the ink is a fuzzy gray copy of a copy of a copy. Don't buy new!!! Find a used one in good condition and you'll have a MUCH better book. I only gave it 2 stars because the collection of songs is good.
4,Very Informative,"This book has some great information on what appears to be some fabulous spas and resorts. It was nice to see not only great photos but real practical information like the types of packages offered, the prices, accommodations available, and even information on tourist attractions near the spas. It also gives you some explanations of the types of services offered which was helpful. It covers spas from all over the globe which makes it quite a nice comprehensive overview as well. I haven't actually tried one of them out yet - but it has been nice to dream."
3,Collection of interesting circuits for hobbyists.,"A collection of circuits and projects that demonstrate usage of several solid-state devices, mostly ICs. Discussion of principles is very scant, however. That would require more in-depth background than a book appealing to hobbyists could provide."
2,Not for the advanced,"As an electronics engineer I bought this book because some people recommended it to me. Once I got it I was disappointed since I didn't find anything interesting in it. The quality of what's in it is not bad, but its just not for me. It might be good for people who want to tinker a bit with electronics. I don't think I will ever pick it up again."
4,"Finally, an ergonomic cello technique","So, after 30 years of semi-professional recording and performance, my back is getting pretty tweaky. Plus, I was starting to get some repetitive stress injury after a dense season. My doc said I may have to quit. Well, this book is totally revolutionary. It gives many many ideas about how to reposition myself while playing; things I'd never thought of. I am back playing. I have many ideas still to incorporate, but I already feel much better. I now require my students to get this book. Everyone is excited about these ideas. This is, I repeat, revolutionary, and should be required for those of you who want to play without pain for many years. I deducted one star because there is just so much information, that it looks a little overwhelming. It would probably have been better to do two books. But, since it's not, take a look at it."
3,Helpful...if you're not a beginner.,"This book is well written and easy to read, but as a beginning cello player, it ended up being more confusing than helpful. The suggestions made in the book seem like logical contradictions to traditional instruction, but when trying to learn the basics from all of the cello teachers I tried, they were irritated by alternate methods described in the book. I think the major problem is that instead of posing the ""new directions"" as alternate methods to an old system and explaining the initial reasons for the old methods coming about thereby allowing the reader to choose for herself, it just discards traditional methodology altogether."
4,Practical directions for cellists,Author is a cellist who has practical suggestions for prevention and amelioration of symptoms related to posture and technique. The line illustrations are useful. Relaxation issues are discussed in relation to repetitive stress conditions. This book can be useful for beginners and professionals alike.
3,ok read,"the book arrived quickly. i read a couple of stories out of it. the stories are cute, short. It a book i would rate PG"
3,Different packaging,"I was confused at first because the DVD case I received was mostly green and wasn't actually labeled as ""AM and PM Meditation"" It did have an AM and a PM meditation selection on the menu and it was hosted by rodney yee and maritza so I guess it is the same one.I was expecting more meditation less yoga with this dvd... I already have the AM & PM yoga dvd"
4,four stars if you want me to rate it don't ask me to type in eighteen words take it like this,four stars if you want me to rate it don't ask me to type in eighteen words take it like this
2,A bit disappointing,"At last a Canadian quotes book. Much needed. Problem is that most of the quotes (like 99%) are from the last 50 years, so if you want to use any of them they are not yet in the public domain. Thus, not a great resource for anyone who needs a quote for commercial purposes...."
2,ok..,were not long enough on the rear fenders of a 04 f250. Hard to screw into the fenders and have it follow the contours. I should have saved my money and bought bushwacker cutouts.
3,"cute, funny, but not entirely accurate..","this book deals with slang which must vary greatly...I don't think it really deals with an regeonalisms, it just has some cute phrases...dirty words, etc. that you won't find elsewhere. perhaps it's a good idea, but could be better done."
3,"Not precise, but it'll do","I'll start by saying that I'm spoiled by those $25,000 electric cutters with digital displays as I used to work for a printshop. So using this manual stack cutter is a massive downgrade for me. I know I'm not supposed to compare the two, but I just can't help it. So bear with me. First, the good things. It does cut a stack of paper. That's about it. Now the bad. The measurement marking is not accurate, so naturally the sliding guide isn't accurate either. The side guide and the sliding guide are not exactly perpendicular. I'll just assume the side guide is straighter since the sliding guide has to constantly move. The clamp and the guillotine blade will sometimes shift the paper stack, so you'll have to be very very careful. In short, it takes a bit of practice to make this cutter usable without destroying your stuff. For cutting jobs that don't need to be extremely precise, this will do the job in a pinch."
2,Not A Precise Cutter,"We make Wedding invitaions etc. so we need a precise cutter. The QCM started out OK but after 3 months no longer makes precise cuts. Cutting a stack of 1/2 inch card stock always results in cuts that are slightly off. If you aren't that fussy it's fine but some times we are cutting after printing full bleed images and no matter how carefully we line up the cuts they come out slightly off and we have to throw out the job and restart. This is a low end product made in China. The quality if the steel, the joints and controls are not made to last."
4,It does the job,"I needed a stack cutter for my home based business and this was my pick. For the price, for the good reviews, it seemed to be just the thing.I asked the seller to ship it ASAP - and they did, got it in just a few days UPS ground. THANK YOU! I am happy to report that the cutter is doing the job just fine and I can recommend it.A few points: First, this is not made in the USA but China -despite posts to the contrary. 2nd, assembly is required and the directions are less than stellar but you will figure it out. 3rd, mine came with some rust on the silver portion of the lever arm. Not a big deal to me but for others maybe so. Figuring out exactly where the cutter will cut the paper is a little tricky but suppose I will master this in time.You could go out and spend $70 for a board that cuts 12 pages and lasts a few months. Comparatively, this is a much better way to go."
2,Owner,"The cutter worked very well when I first got it. I had it about 2 weeks and it somehow got out of square. Starting cutting crooked. After several phone conversations with different people I was sent a return label which was a possible solution. My problem is I run a print shop and my cutter is a vital part of the shop. I'm not sure if I just got a lemon or what happened. I emailed company a couple of times asking if perhaps there was an authorized technician in my area that could take a look and nobody has responded. My husband has tried to make slight adjustments to the cutter . . . square it up per accompanied instructions and it works for a short period and then is soon out of square. I can't be without it for several weeks (which is probably the time frame I'm looking at if I sent it back) as I have a business to run, but if there was an authorized technician I could take it to them for a day or so."
4,So happy I bought this cutter,"I own a small business where I print and cut hundreds of sheets of cardstock per month. I was SO tired of cutting only two sheets at a time using the paper trimmer I bought from the office supplies store. After much research, I finally decided to purchase this paper cutter and only wish I had bought it sooner! It cuts through large stacks of paper SOOO easily and cleanly. It has really saved me a lot of time on my cutting and I no longer dread having to cut paper. I do notice that it cuts larger stacks better than smaller ones. Anything smaller than 25 sheets of 100lb cardstock it makes indentions in the paper. But larger stacks and they are perfect. It took a few times to get used to how it cuts. Mine cuts at a slight angle so after a few times I learned to load my paper at a slight angle to get the perfectly aligned cut. Overall, I am just thrilled with this cutter!!"
4,"Good Product, Bad Shipping","My experience with paper cutters is the swing arm pieces of garbage that last a month, so not an expert. This is incredible in comparison. The blade cuts a ream of paper so easily its a little scary (feels Medieval). The guides could probably be more accurate, but we've cut tens of thousands of sheets now and the blade is still going strong. Only issue is the ""Express Shipping"" is UPS ground - not sure what my $50 upcharge got me. Seller wasn't real interested in doing anything about it."
2,Top Guitarist,"Whilst Gaitsch is an excellent guitarist, this is a mostly forgettable album. Worth buying for one excellent reason, the haunting, ""Haunt Me Tonight"" sung by Richard Marx. Some of Gaitsch's best work has been for Marx, Ie. Guitar solo in ""Hazard""."
2,"Very dense, detailed and dry.","I got this book for my 69 year old veteran/father for Christmas last year. He is normally a fan of a good military book, but he said he had a very hard time plowing through this one. Tons of detail and descriptions that got in the way of carrying a cohesive story. I don't think he even finished it, or cared that he didn't. It was not one of his favorites."
3,Detailed Account,"This book appears to be very well researched. Many of the accounts are both interesting and informative, right down to names of the killed and wounded rangers. The military structure, no doubt needed for accuracy, sometimes gets in the way of the general flow of the narrative. Groups are being attached, detached, and re-assigned frequently and it is difficult for an outsider to follow it."
1,What you see is NOT what you get...,"I ordered the part based on the picture showing a Delta brand replacement part. I recieved a non-Delta part that was NOT an exact replacement. The spacing for the holes was off and after installing it (as well as the replacement washers and springs) the faucet dripped when the handle was in the ""off"" position. I would have to try to jiggle it just slightly to the ""on"" position to stop it from leaking. That was easier said than done - since the ball is just slightly larger than the actual Delta-made part. It made the act of turing on the faucet a two handed proposition. I've never seen a faucet so difficult to operate. I gave up and went to the local hardware store and paid triple the price for the actual Delta made replacement parts. The picture for this part is very deceptive - you will NOT recieve a genuine Delta replacement part - so it may or may not work in a faucet that specifies this part #"
4,Delta Replacement parts,"Excellent. Did the trick, just be careful not to buy unnecessary extra parts. Amazon.com is a great place to shop!"
1,faucet repair,"I bought this item along with the washer and spring repair parts which apparently were not a ""Genuine Delta Part"" because after disassembly of faucet and then reassembly the faucet still leaked...I contacted Delta as to my problem and they sent out repair parts free of charge. The faucet now performs as it did when new."
5,Perfect,Exactly what I was looking for. Took old one off that was leaking and put this one on. Total of about 1 minute job!
1,Delta Ball assembly,"I didn't like the ball assembly, it didn't fitWouldn't recommend it.I had to use the existing ball assembly"
5,excellent-darkness,I am very pleased with the blackout curtains. They work extremely well. I am using them on the back side of some sheer curtains that I loved and it looks good.
2,"Good, but skips","Although the music was what I wanted, I was very disappointed that the CD has skips, including in the track for which I bought it. I was told that it was a new copy, but it was defective. I can still listen to it, but I am bummed that a supposedly-new CD skips."
2,disappointing,"I have several of Brickman's works and have enjoyed them for years, however, this one was very disappointing. The album seemed to be over produced in the studio. His earlier albums are fresh and beautiful in a very simplistic way, with just enough instumentation and melody. I actually bought two of these CD's, planning on giving one for a gift. After listening to the CD I will return the one that I was going to give away. I wouldn't subject anyone else to this. Jim, go back the music that made you!"
2,Disappointing for a Brickman Fan,"A family member bought this CD for me, knowing I am a huge fan of Jim Brickman. I was disappinted. Not one cut in this collection is memorable. There is no continuity. The cover promises far more than the CD delivers."
5,Like Love is by far my favorite song on the CD,"Harris and Ingram sound beautiful together. Their voices are smooth and rich, perfect for the haunting ballad. More from Marilyn Harris!"
4,A wonderful compilation!!,What a breath of fresh air!! This album is really great and the duets are especially great. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves good songwriting(something we don't see too much of anymore!!).
4,Fine listening CD,"This is a surprisingly ""together"" CD, considering the various artists and styles represented. I'm particularly fond of ""LIKE LOVE"". Who is Marilyn Harris? It doesn't really matter WHO she is - the track is so terrific."
2,"Big Promise, Big Letdown","George Harrison used to say ""Don't have expect a lot, you won't be disappointed."" Sadly, this slogan applies here, especially when compared to his fine solo material."
2,I was a bit disapointed.,"I love Jim Brickman's solo piano music much more then songs. I like it when he sings. But, this CD wasn't all that great. Keep up on the piano music and some songs but not a whole album."
4,If You Like DAVID FOSTER...,"As this is my first album of Jim Brickman, I can't help reminding David Foster when I listen to this. But I like David Foster very musch. If you like ""ROMANTIC POP BALLARS"" from '80s (this album was recorded in 1998), you'll like this CD. All songs are sweet, sweet, sweet. I'd like to play this CD on my way home after a long drive with my girlfriend (at night, of course.) I know we'll fall into silence and listen to these music. (As for me, I have to buy another Jim Brickman and find his solo works. P.S. I found Dave Koz, his sax is beautiful. I'd like to buy his album some day. I like 'Partners in Crime' best. 'Getting Over You (Janis Ian)' is 2nd best, and 'Your Love (Michelle Wright)' is 3rd best...)"
5,Excellent and varied music for the romatic soul,"This is a marked departure from other albums by Brickman. It mixes vocals with the beautiful instramental sytle Brickman is known for. Thoroughly enjoyable to listen to time and time again. I would love to see him in concert in Spokane, Washington!"
5,The wonderful opera has been unjustly neglected,"This is a merry, intimate production of one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most melodious operas. This tape is especially valuable, because the show is one that local Gilbert and Sullivan groups rarely peform (although the Ohio Light Opera has revived it twice with great artistic success in the past decade). The show has some problems, of course. The three-act format is awkward. Gilbert's libretto showers hearty, Victorian male ridicule on the notion of female education. But musically, this baby is as red hot as anything the boys ever did. Once heard, these glorious melodies will enrich your life forever. As others have observed, this series of tapes hits and misses. But I believe that ""Princess Ida"" is one of their real winners."
3,Relatively great,"Of the Brent Walker/Opera World Gilbert & Sullivan productions, I think this one is the best. The parts are cast quite consistently, rather than having great performers and well-prepared scenes mixed with unprepared people who can't find the tunes, catch the dance steps, or figure out their characters."
2,Flawed production,"I agree with all the other reviewers said about the performance, but the play-within-a-play format cooked up for this particular production is a jarring note and distracts from the otherwise high quality production.This is one of the most melodic of G&S operettas and I wish it were performed more often. ""Whom Thou Hast Chained"" is an absolute delight."
5,The best book on ASP,I have bought just about any book that I could find on ASP. I have tried and used most of the WROX bboks and I have found that this book is the best to understand and use. I have recommended that the company that I work for buy it for all of our developers. You will not go wrong buying this book.
3,"Good, but has some factual errors","On the plus side, this book provides a comprehensive coverage of most ASP topics. However, some topics like Index Server get only a superficial coverage.However, I did find some factual mistakes. For example, the author advises against turning buffering on (Response.Buffer = True) because it will have an adverse effect on performance, but of course the reverse is true."
5,Active Server Pages 2.0: Unleashed,Great book to put next to my computers. Sample codes can be used for my project.
2,Useless purchase,"I'd call myself an intermediate web site designer, and this is the worst technical book I have ever purchased. In order to learn, a person must understand the ""why"" with the ""how"". This book explains none of that. There is no learning here. If all you want to do is memorize examples of code, then purchase this book. But if you want to know how and why the code works so you can extrapolate, even maybe get creative with it and develop, then YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK."
3,Not Completely Happy,"I did find some poor programming practices used in this book. I was taken aback when I ran into some of this and suddenly realized where one of our programmers got the idea it was okay to write code the way he did. I still like this book and this series of books better than that series with the red cover, but I was really surprised with some of the problems I found in the sample code. I would still recommend this book to people, but would want them to be aware that there are some problems. Performing standard checks on your code should prevent you from any eggregious mistakes."
5,Great Book,"This is a great ASP book, covers all essential topics and has useful code snippets. It's an essential addition for every ASP developer."
3,Questionable content,"I'm not sure the author encourages them, but he certainly mentions a number of ASP coding styles that are sloppy or error-prone.Covers a lot of stuff, though."
4,"Nice bag, but not real leather.","This is a nice bag, very stylish and durable. However, this is not a real leather, so the description is misleading."
1,Horrible,"If you're looking for a purse that that is and looks like it's made out of cheap plastic, this is for you."
1,misleading advertising again,This bag was exactly the same as another bag supposedly by a different manufacturer. Again this was not leather. I have never been so disappointed in my purchases from amazon simply because of the false advertising.
1,Ugly bag,"I was so disappointed when I received this bag: cheaply look, hard and fake leather. It is even uglier than a $5 bag I bought in Vietnam."
3,good,"the package arrives in time and in good condition, the bag looks like as in the picture... the only thing which i dont like is the zipper..."
4,"Good book, wrong car on the cover.","With all research Bentley does to make a wonderful repair manual, why couldn't they put the right car on the cover? The car on the cover is a 7 from 1997-2003."
3,not that big of a deal,"As a BMW E32 owner I agree with David Lloyd when he writes: ""I think the Authors are trying to cram to many engine types into 1 book"". The three engine types are very different from each other and their service procedures couldn't be described together as one.Poor trim coverage: many items were simply omitted. Almost half of the book is dedicated to electrical schemes.Not so detailed and illustrated as expected; not intended for beginners or car owners."
5,Gilbert and Sullivan,"I have only watched ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" so far, but I love it! The cameras are ""Up close"" with the singers and the performers are phenominal! Great to use if you are going on an audition and plan to sing anything from Gilbert and Sullivan Repetoir."
3,Review of the last two purchases from Amazon,"The DVD's were great and suited my purpose. However, the single cd select song that I downloaded ""Silvered is the Raven Hair"" from Patience only downloaded one half of the song. This was the song I wanted to review in its full mode. Half the song didn't work. I was disappointed and frankly did not know how to notify you of the insufficient (1/2 a song) purchase. Is there a way I could get my $.99 back? It is a small amount but....Carol L. Stewart"
1,Price Change,"This item was $139 three weeks back, unavailable for few days, $149 last week, $159 this week.Why the price hike? What is the rationale behind these frequent hike?"
5,"Rembering, writing, healing","Now that we hear so much about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that cripples a startling number of veterans returning from Iraq, we are increasingly aware of what a monumental influence trauma can have on an individual's life and on our society. But psychological traumas occur not only in the killing fields but also in seemingly ordinary homes where children and adults sometimes suffer severe psychological trauma from a variety of sources. McDonnell writes for those people who are haunted by painful personal experiences. She artfully guides her readers through lessons in the delicate process of writing about a past that is difficult and unpleasant to recall. And she holds out the hope that the process will be healing."
4,it's awesome!,"i bought this game last thursday and i have barely not been playing it you can play as (and i am listing them in the order you get them)Gohan,Piccolo,Vegeta,Trunks and of course Goku. this game is really long but kinda easy but some of the basses are really hard (without senzu beans) you can level them up to 50 and there is a secret character and after you beat the game you can still walk around the world and explore as much as you want. They stayed much closer to the actual story line of the show. the only downside is after you beat the cell games and goku dies you can't control him anymore period. Even if you have never heard of DBZ you will like this game its a must buy! (walks off to play it)."
4,aswome with some flaws,alright theres something u should know about me im a huge dbz fan but this game could use some work it has the ponteial to grow but it has some flaws hence the title of this. well the biggest flaw is that u cant save after u go to the epoliuge another flaw u have to save at the save circles boo hoo. well it gets chanlglleing so i suggest u get a guide like me if u do that then ur set. theres this really cool part at the end but i wont tell it to u. other than some flaws this game rocks. i suggest u buy this game and the new one comeing out on october 17th. the new one has brolly in it. yeah.
4,Awesome!! Way better than first one!!,"If you've played the first, you know that 2 is going to be awesome!! Because, the first is okay(if you use *the invincibility code!!). Back to 2! First of all, its longer, its easier, better graphics, more characters, new moves, 2x more levels ,and more, I think! If 1 was a must have, 2 is waiting for you!! My favorite character: Trunks. My favorite energy move: Spirit Bomb. My favorite melee move: Flurry Punch. My favorite status picture: Trunks' first Saiyan mode picture.*Still want to know the invincibility code(for 1st game only!!!)? It is:up,down,left,right,a,b, on the intro movie. It'll make life easier especially when fighting Frieza!!"
4,game was ok,"Well Bombshell, I liked this game too. I liked it much better then first legacy. It was not as simple, and seem to have a better game length then the first. I am glad to see you seem to like DBZ as much as I do... perhaps a psychic link, lol."
4,The BESTEST GAME FOREVER,"I HEARD THE GAME WAS HOTTTTTTT!!. IT GOT BETTER BALLTES,MORE NEEDED THINGS,YOU CAN PICK TRNUKS,GOHAN,GOKU,VEGETA OR PICOLO.MORE THINGS TO DO.BETTER FLYING."
1,help wer are the seven nameks!,please help me anyone out there!im having trouble finding the last nameks can you tell me wer is the last nameks!Thank You
1,this game is terrible,"First of all, they didn't have any half stars.The amount you get to fly is pathetic . The amount you have to blast your enemies is too long. It's not at all like the TV show DBZ. When you fly if you're over a piece of land and you flew there but you're on the edge you cant land you have to go back where you were."
4,MORE THAN GOKU!!!,"I got this game and it was great.The graphice are so so but who cares.This game is fun while you have it but after beat it it gets boring.It is also too easy.Here are my ratings:Graphics 3/5Gameplay 5/5Funness 10/5Difficulty 2/5This game isn't that great but I strongly reccomend it.Hey it is better than the last one.Maybe it is worth your'e money.Could be less but what the heck.It isn't that bad.Like I said you should try to get it.You can play as trunks,picillo,gohan,vegeta,and goku.You can turn Super Saiyan with all of them except picillo he turns super namek!you can do punces kicks blasts everything!"
2,Garbage,"Pretty much the worst game I've played on the GBA. Suitable for only the most rabid of DBZ fanboys. I love the series, but the game is sheer garbage. Typical Infogrames."
4,A fun game,"This game is entertaining. If you've played the first game then that makes it even better. The graphics may not be perfect, but it's impressive how there are five different characters for you to play with. Each one has it's own tasks. This game is not hard, but not too easy either."
1,A very narrow-minded one-sided work,"This book is written by a group of extreme left wing architects and journalists. It's a flirt with antisemitism and a major self-hatered manifesto. It is full with half-truths and misleading information. It's not worth the paper it was printed on. If you do intend to read it, do yourself a big favor and read ""A Durable Peace"" by Benjamin Netanyahu. For a true insight of the reality of this complexe reality which is the Israeli-palestinian conflict."
3,More of a checklist than an explication,"The subtitle gives you an indication that this is not exactly a reading experience, but a guidebook during your actually sojourn. While it contains some useful pre-trip information, Stephenson concentrates on detailing the flora and fauna that are on each island, and their approximate locations, in a format that is almost like a checklist (or, for the birders out there, a lifelist). Stephenson is knowledgeable, and her information accurate as far as I can tell, but there's really no savoir faire here, and there's the rub. If I had only this to base my foreknowledge of the islands, I'm not so sure I'd be so excited about going. Luckily, there's other books that are better at capturing the uniqueness of the islands and their place in history and our world today."
1,not recommended,"The item I received simply did not work. The ""stem"" was designed to fit into the bottom plate holder but it did not fit. Perhaps it was designed to screw in, but there were no circular rivets for it to screw into. The stem would not stand alone on the bottom plate. Most of these type holders are made as one piece & the top of the stem unscrews but this was not made that way. I had to send it back. I ended up getting a much cheaper modern looking one that I don't like nearly as well, but at least it works."
3,Arthur Court paper towel dispenser,"I love the appearance and quality of the craftsmanship, but I find it more difficult to remove towels from the roll than other towel dispensers. The design of the base is lacking in stability."
3,Disappointed,"I love Arthur Court products but this is a big disappointment. It's just not designed to work easily. Instead of the rooster coming off the top to easily install paper towels, you have to unscrew from the base and it's difficult to re-seat. Not sure what they were thinking - I certainly expected it to be functional."
1,50 pound slippers,Bought 3 different sizes and none of them fit. My foot had to strain to keep them on. They are very heavy and run extra big -- ended up with a pair 2 sizes down but threw them away shortly after. You get what you pay for.
2,The composer's best work,"I am not a fan of this composer. This is certainly his best work, but that isn't a high recommendation. At least the synths on this fit in, and the lyrics are supposed to be humorous. Taylor should consider more comedy and less overwrought drama, and perhaps a few classes in songwriting."
2,Needs a plot outline!,"Some of this music is upbeat and fun with lively melodies and nice performances, but it badly needs to come with a plot outline because it's very difficult to figure out exactly what is going on at times, and who certain characters are supposed to be. What is their involvement in the story? The recording gives no clue.This musical is based loosely on the Faust legend, which isn't the most original of storylines but it beats having an amateur composer tackle Shakespeare! Not bad, but not great either."
4,Great Scale,Great for keeping weight of food easily. I especially enjoy that you can zero the scale as you place your portions of each food on the plate. Easy to use.
3,It's just okay,"The scale is okay, but the LED readouts are faint and difficult to read. Also, I haven't been able to find every food that I've input. But it is relatively easy to use and it gives good detailed information on the items that I have found."
4,Slater 1450,Product delivers as advertised. Takes a bit of getting used to to operate quickly and without starting over mutiple times. Not magic though. You must have the discipline to use it. If you don't have the discipline don't waste your money.
3,"A little ""iffy"" so far","I just bought the Salter 1450 scale last Thursday and had to return it on Sunday. At first I loved the scale. It was really convenient to have all of the nutritional information for the foods you are eating right at your fingertips. But after the first couple of days, the scale would only say ""Errr"" on the screen when I weighted anything. I went ahead and returned it for another one, figuring I would give it another go. But if it does it again, I will be force to get a different kind of scale. So far not so good."
2,no0t to happy,"the salter 1450 seemed to work just fine until I got to making up my own recipt part,when I added the first few items it worked fine but when I entered the next item it would tack on maybe a 1000calories when it should have been 50, I could'nt figure out if it was the scales or I just couldn't figure out how to do it.I finally sent it back because it was just to complicated and time consuming for me,I didn't like the keyboard arrangment,it just took to long using the numbers for lettersI think it is a good product just not for me."
3,W-A-Y too much work,"Perhaps had I not previously owned a Salter 1400 I would have liked the 1450. I much prefer entering a simple number for a food (e.g. apple is #205) on the 1400 than to type out the food name on a keypad (pressing the number 5 three times to type an ""L""). Being able to customize the 1450 scale is fabulous, but I just wouldn't use it that often. It's a good product, just cumbersome. I returned it to Amazon and purchased another 1400 and am very happy."
5,How to make friends fast in a bar...,"USMC wisdom - you don't get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression. Maybe it's old school, but some of us find it advantageous to make our initial contacts in person. This item can serve as a nice introductory gift to your favorite bar tendress, helping you stand out from the faceless crowd, or as an interesting show-and-tell curiousity to share with Happy Hour friends. If anybody actually wants one of these, it's a bonus - who care what it actually does? The massive amount of goodwill it can buy you makes it a steal! Think of it as a bar catalyst, something that may help you get to where you're going more quickly.(Note: Search for ""Excalibur Bar Master"" in all categories - there's more than one model available.)"
4,Good Geometry Proofs Textbook,"This is a good text book. It has lots of clear worked out proofs of propostitions. Many of the exercises at the end of each lesson require that you find proofs of propostions mentioned in the text but were not proven. This book also has good drawings of shapes that explain what the propositions, theorems,and axioms mean. Since I am a student, I personally think the exercises at the end of the chapters are somewhat difficulty to figure out, but for others they might not be. If your professor doesn't explain the material well, you can at least try to understand by yourself using this text. Overall, this is a good textbook."
5,Exactly as described,"This book arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Seriously looked new. Loved that it was available for renting, as I won't be keeping it past a semester!"
5,A Real Classic,"This is the fourth edition of a particularly fine textby Marvin Jay Greenberg. If you want to learn aboutEuclidean and non-Euclidean geometries---the great contributionsof Bolyai and Lobachevsky---this is the place to do it. Thebook is authoritative but warm and inviting. It is full ofgood history and full of good mathematics.The fourth edition has a good deal of new material. Greenbergexplores some of the subtle logical issues, and also someof the tricky points of geometry. He makes far-rangingcommentary on how non-Euclidean geometry fits into the modernflow of mathematical thought. There is even some discussionof Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture.Even a reader without a strong mathematical background will geta good deal from dipping into this book. It gives a greatsense of what the mathematical enterprise is all about, writtenby a distinguished mathematician (who was also my teacher manyyears ago). I consider this work to be one of the treasures onmy bookshelf."
2,One disapointing camera,"I've been testing several cameras for my work and so far this one is the worst performance to cost for video we've played with. To get a one star it would have to have failed install or been otherwise fatally flawed as it is it works but The quality of the image , lack of focus ability and the quality of image, repetition? Nah it's a camera and it's worth noting that it's primary function is no better than a $5 after rebate model. Given the $70 price point this thing is seriously disappointing.Sound's pretty good and unlike the MS vx3000 which has a great picture ( but lags the sound horribly) it works on systems other than XP/ Vista )It's a real shame since it's nicely designed , has a pretty good software bundle ( specially if IM is your main use). Given that most of the reviews online have the same image issues I'd find something better than Creative live"
4,It is hard to say,"My image on my screen is very sharp,however on the other side of transmission the picture is some what blured ( pixelated). The problem could be other then the quality of the Live Cam itselfe.G"
3,Bad experience with Creative web-cams in the past ...,"I bought a creative webcam in 2003 that kind of resembled a snail shell. It was total garbage! Slow responses times, hardly ever took a ""stable"" picture (mostly blurry), did not have good light response, and didn't even rotate! This was supposed to be a webcam that could also be a portable digital camera. Ha! Not so much. I paid $100 through Amazon for this Creative Web-Cam. I did not know that this camera was garbage and I was so frustrated that I never tried to return it for a refund -- I just suffered with it's inadequacy. Two years earlier, I bought an Intel webcam through Dell for $48. It worked great -- it even swiveled, and made movies! Only $48! So why is Creative making garbage for $100? Maybe they have improved in 4 years? I don't know. Karma always comes back around, so this is my report and caveat to people about my experience with a garbage webcam bought from Creative."
4,Webcam,"I like the webcam alot, but I am a little disappointed with the resolution. I figured it would have been more clear since it claims to be 7.0 megapixel."
4,"Really great, EXCEPT!","Got my wonderful Creative webcam, proudly installed the software, uninstalled the software, installed the software, uninstalled the software. Anyway you get the idea. Not put off by dumb machines, I tried several changes in the default layout. It seems the layout the Creative believes is the living end, AIN'T! I had to change it to AVI and the Intel Indedo video compresser and changed the audio compresser to MPEG layer-3.Best it's little heart, within range it follows me around when I move in the chair, keeping me centered in the picture. I like that.I was this close to sending it back (*) because I had a problem!"
2,Disappointed,"Originally I purchased the Logitech QuickCam Fusion ... LOVED IT, but found out after I purchased it that the Logitech software does NOT work with Windows Media Center Edition. That's too bad, since probably more than half of the computers sold to home users are pre-loaded with MCE.So, even though I absolutely LOVED the quality of the Logitech Fusion, I had to send it back.Bought this camera (Creative Live!) instead. WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.Software is confusing.Camera quality is VERY poor in low light.Only good thing about this camera is the wide angle lens.Bottom line ... if you don't have Windows Media Center Edition on your computer, DEFINITELY get the Logitech Fusion instead.If you DO have Windows MCE, well then you're stuck in the same boat as me ... looking all over for a decent camera :(I'm going to return the Creative Live! and see what else is out there."
3,Nothing Special,"In image quality point of view, it is not something special. You can have the same image quality by purchasing a webcame for much much lower price."
4,Just what I was looking for.,I was looking for new pet bowls to match kitchen... this was perfect. The colors were true to the photo. Good quality.
5,Perfect for my dog,"I got this dog bowl for a 25 pound poodle mix. It is a TAD, big for the size of my dog proportionally, but it doesn't bother the dog at all. My biggest issue with thin stainless steel bowls or plastic bowls was that my dog would push that bowl all around the room by the time he's finished with his food. However this bowl has a lot of weight to it, allowing it to stay in place and gives my dog a nice STATIONARY meal haha.It's sturdy, and definitely has a feel of quality to it. I've always chosen ceramic bowls for my dogs simply for quality. The design is simple and elegant and is the best dog bowl I've had in years.So if you dog is a medium size, and likes to push his food out of the bowl, or moves the bowl around a lot while eating, this is the perfect bowl for your pet.It is also dishwasher safe, and microwave safe. So this will also benefit those who like to give their dogs a warm meal, or have to prepare hand-made meals for their pet."
5,Best bowl!,"I bought two of these bowls back in May for my two Pit mixes (100lb and 65lb), They are rough on dog bowls, nosing and flipping them when they want to play or when they think I'm late with breakfast or dinner. These hold up extremely well! There isn't a scratch, chip, or crack anywhere! I have microwaved these bowls, run them through the dishwasher, and have dropped pots on them accidently if I am washing them in the sink. Doesn't phase these bowls at all. They still look brand new. If they ever need replacing, I will absolutely repurchase."
4,Dog Bowls,"Petrageous Designs City Pets 8"" Pet Bowl, BonesThe Petrageous dog bowls are very attractive and easy to care for. They do not chip easily or get stained from food."
1,Do not buy this dvd.,This DVD is terrible. The critics narration is over-dubbed on every video clip. There is not one complete music video on this DVD. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. It pisses me off that I bought it. Buy other Beatles DVD's instead.
3,THE BEATLES/BLUE ALBUM 1967-1970,"I enjoyed this kind of documentary video. I has ""clips"" that i had not seen before. I also enjoyed,music videos. Some of the reporting, was good info.not a needed dvd for beatles collection, however does carry, some entertainment for viewing. thanxz. the Beatles 4 ever:)"
2,Find Something else,"I wish I hadn't spent the money on this book, which I got becuase it's companion ""Knit Hats!"" was excellent. Knit Mittens! does not have the variety of interesting concepts and patterns found in Knit Hats! I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone if they haven't looked through it themselves and decided whether or not it is worth buying for the few patterns they will probably enjoy."
4,Keeping fingers warm and have fun too!,"Great book for visuals, methods, sizing and great instructions. Easy to modify most patterns to suit your own particular needs.Great Addition to a home knitting library!"
2,Knit Mittens 15 Cool Patterns to keep- you warm,"Knit Mittens 15 Cool Patterns to keep- you warm was advertised as used in good condition. The content was great, but the ""used in good condition"" was scribbled on 80% iof the pages. The Cover was torn and back was broken. The book was used while eating because there was food spots on it and it smelled horrible. I returned the book, very disappointed that I couldn't keep a book in such a bad condition. (especially the smell)"
3,Expected Another Knit Scarfs!,"I expected this book to be similar to their book on knitting scarfs, which went from easy to difficult scarfs. But, this book sort of jumped right into difficult mittens, and to be honest, I couldn't find one pair of mittens less intimidating enough for me to try. I haven't worked a pattern yet in the book. :( For me, it's a quick two thumbs down, but other more experienced knitters might enjoy it, I'm sure."
3,Bodum changed their Glasses,I have been purchasing/using the Bodum Canteen Double Wall Tumblers for years. I have been replacing broken tumblers for just about as long. This was the first set of replacement tumblers that I am dissatisfied with. Bodum has done something to their design that is different. This last batch gets cloudy and doesn't look near as clear .... EVER!Not happy with the design change.
4,Double Wall tumbler,This was a request from my son-in-law to replace broken ones. They like the glasses and thus reordered more! They keep drinks hotter longer.
1,dissatisfied,I was sent the wrong item twice. Kitchco said they were issuing me a credit. I have not received it yet.
3,"Great form factor, so-so optics","It's hard not to like this monocular, you will not find a smaller, lighter monocular on the market. Unfortunately, image quality is just fair. I tried about a dozen different monoculars looking for the ideal one, and this one just wasn't it for me.If size and weight are the most important factors for you, then this is by far the best choice. With it's pen clip you can easily carry this in a shirt pocket. It's just a little bigger in diameter than a ball point pen, and about the same weight. It's also easy to focus.While there is nothing bad about the image quality, it's nothing special either. I could honestly make out distant objects at the same resolution with an $18 Carson 7 x 18 monocular.A good alternative to this model would be theNikon 6x15 Monocular II. While it's certainly bulkier than the Zeiss, it will still slip very easily into a shirt pocket and is still relatively light. The Nikon offers vastly superior image quality in my opinion."
4,MiniQuick Monocular Review,To be honest I thought this item was a bit expensive when I bought it. But after I received it I'd say that it was worth the price. The quality of the optics is great and it is very well constructed.
3,A well-knit novel,"Anne Bartlett's first novel is not really about knitting; it's about coping with loss. But Bartlett is herself a knitter and knitting figures prominently in the plot and its resolution. Those who knit will appreciate the detail that accompanies descriptions of knitting projects and techniques. Those who do not knit can enjoy Bartlett's poignant story about two widows who have almost nothing in common facing their respective losses in a curiously similar way. The plot is a little odd at key moments, the characters are both a little quirky, but the book is well written and insightful."
3,"I had high hopes, but...","As an avid knitter and reader, I had high hopes for this novel. I really wanted to enjoy it, but sadly, I can only muster 3 stars for it. The only reason I can even give it 3 is because it is about knitting. For me, one of the major downfalls of this novel is the whining, rude main character, Sandra. She's sad and full of grief, but I still couldn't bring myself to care about her. Martha is different enough to be just plain weird sometimes, and I couldn't understand her actions and thoughts. These two characters try to put together a knitting exhibition, with what seems like very little thought and planning. I kept asking myself, ""Why?"". Why would Martha undertake all this knitting single-handedly? Why would Sandra even want to plan the exhibit when she seemed to have no real regard or respect for hand-knitting? Sadly, I don't think this book puts the author anywhere near the company of Barbara Kingsolver or Carol Shields."
2,Extremely Underwhelmed,"I purchased this book without seeing any reviews. I love to knit and thought that I would enjoy a novel about knitting. I was wrong. The characters were never really developed or explained, everything seemed very shallow. I never felt like I knew or cared about any of the characters. I found it tiresome reading with nothing to hold me. I did not even finish the last 2 pages."
1,Knitting Noddy,"I opened to the first page of this book with great expectations only to be increasingly disappointed with each new page until I fully realised how trite and self indulgent it was going to be. While the writing is lovely, it's also sappy and predictable. Save your money and take a peek at Knitting in your library instead."
2,booooooring and strange!,This book is sure to put you to sleep after you knit. Not a very interesting book.
2,Mediocre - Pedestrian,Neither Vincent Price nor Keith Michel can sing! That fact alone goes a long way towards destroying this rather bad presentation of the absolutely superb operetta that Gilbert and Sullivan wrote. What a contrast to the splendid job that the Canadian Stratford Company did with Gilbert and Sullivan.
1,RUDDIGORE go home!,"""Ruddigore"" has a special place in the hearts of many diehard Savoyards. It is one of my personal favorites and Act One is certainly one of the finest things in the entire Savoy Series.Alas, one could hardly imagine a worse production than the one here. In a bizarre way it actually becomes a textbook on how NOT to produce G&S. Abridged, miscast and ill-conceived it's a complete mess from start to finish."
3,It's Price's show.,"A-many years ago, with young and overly ambitious ideas of enlisting the late, great Vincent Price to play Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, I approached him after a talk he gave at Indiana University. His interested and gracious decline was almost as good as an acceptance. Imagine my astonished gratification to see him later as -- not Sir Roderic -- but Sir Despard.Without Price, I would give this particular version of my favorite operetta about half a star. Act I is downright embarrassing, at least before Sir D's entrance. Price's smooth-as-cream Despard Murgatroyd, however, rates a solid five stars. Vincent Price collectors really shouldn't miss this one.Phyllis Ann Karr"
4,A Horribly Good Time,"I have mixed feelings about this film. On the positive side, it was kind of fun to see this send-up of hammer films, complete with Vincent Price (who surprisingly holds his own in the G&S environment). In this respect, it is an amusing halloween treat that I admittedly enjoy watching every October. On the negative side, like so many other incomplete films in this ""complete G&S"" series, several favorite songs are missing and some of the attempts at horrific humor fall very flat. The chorus was rather annoying to watch, and the ghosts tried to be funny instead of ghostly, which made them almost as annoying as the chorus. And yet for all of that, it is a highly enjoyable film to watch. The best scene? The opening of Act Two with the banter between Ruthven Murgatroyd and Old Adam."
3,Not the best Ruddigore I've seen,"This is a studio production of Gilbert & Sullivan's Ruddigore, by which I mean it was staged for the camera rather than in a theater for a live audience. I expected that the freedom a studio production provides would have allowed this version to surpass theater productions as far as the dramatic element goes, but sadly it did not. The orchestra was excellent and most of the singing was good.I strongly recommend the Seattle Gilbert & Sullivan Society's 2011 production instead, which should be available soon from them directly. The Seattle G&S; recordings are always excellent, and having seen it twice in person, I am certain this production will be excellent on DVD like it was in the theater, just as their other DVDs are."
3,Cheap Production Values Mar The Performance,"While this video is worrth seeing, and perhaps owning, so that you have a copy of Ruddigore (which is hard to find) in your Gilbert and Sullivan library; I couldn't help but feel that the production of this opera suffered from the low-budget video tricks used to make it feel like other than a stage production. This was clearly a made-for-TV special that only a true G&S fan could love.There is also way too much shameless mugging and general hammery in the production; Vincent Price is the exception to this, as his acting performance is fine, although his singing voice would never get him into D'Oyly Carte.Other than this, the singing performances are fine. The staging interferes with the performance; picture a college stage production set interspersed with video bits reminiscent of the worst British pop videos of the late 1970s, and you get the idea."
3,An intriguing introduction to Jimenez,"While I have always found Garcia Lorca both depressing and pretentious (despite his considerable reputation), I was dazzled by the poetry of Juan Ramon Jimenez which I saw here for the first time. It is really unfortunate that he is so unknown in North America. His poetry will open your heart."
2,Not complete what a pity,"While good in quality of cinematography the Singing is average to poor, and the acting campy without humor. My biggest disappointment was that I was expecting a comprehensive compilation of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, however, there are some glaring omissions. (ie. Cox and Box, Trial by Jury, etc.) Overall not a great collection"
1,Too firm,"My husband is used to a ""standard"" cervical pillow but this one is way to far on the firm side to be anywhere near the standard he is used to sleeping on. We'd like to try the soft one, but are hesitant because of the firmness of this one."
2,Nice while it lasted,This laser pointer was bright for a day. I carried it in my jacket pocket (not my back pants pocket) and it got bent just under normal use. The construction is too flimsy to last long.
1,Cheap junk and dangerous,"That's exactly what it is, cheap junk but fun while it lasted until I needed to replace the batteries and read the printed label. The batteries pre-installed lasted less than three hours total of play time. The laser dot had a ring around it which the cat was distracted by. I didn't recognize the item because it was all purple with no logo, so I have no idea if this is truly what I ordered. No pouch was included.No big deal until I needed to replace the batteries and read the label that was glued on the battery cover. It stated, ""DANGER avoid exposure; laser radiation is emitted from this aperture. Manufactured in August 2009"" (more than 2 years ago). I got what I paid for and nuked myself and my cat! I don't know how an item can be sold when it specifically states to avoid using it. I tried to research how much radiation could possibly be emitted but had no luck."
1,not worth the purchase,"very poorly release, almost empty and containing the worst amateur bonuses ever... one can hardly go further in mediocrity! i was extremely deceived. don't buy."
1,"I am sure this is a great DVD-A, but I will never know...","I, too, bought this to play on my DVD-A player in my car and it will not play! Even though the description states it plays on ALL DVD-A players, it does not!!!!!"
2,DVD-not so fast!,"DVD Audio format does NOT play in Bose audio system of Acura RL auto (2006). Apparently this is a known limitation and not the only audio DVD having this ""problem"" with automobile systems. Am searching for a site that might have compiled a list of operatable titles. Until there's a way to authenticate audio DVDs, prior to purchase, I will stay away from them."
1,It simply didn't work,"I tried to play this DVD Audio in my car player (DVD Audio also) as other DVD Audios I have, and it simply didn't work."
3,cute but small,This is a cute case for small cameras. Would not fit the G10 but would work for smaller cameras. The zipper is not the finest but works o.k. I like to keep a camera with me and this is the kind of case you can throw in your bag to keep your camera from getting scratched.
2,Too small,"This product was sold as a companion piece to a Canon Power Shot 720. I returned it as not being up to expectations as it was too snug a fit for my liking. When the camera, spare batteries and a spare SD card were packed in, access to each of the items was simply too hard to be workable for a day to day family workhorse camera. I would not recommend this case for this application."
3,To small for Nikon Coolpix 7000,"This pocket bag is well manufacturing, but to small for the indicate camera in your publicity. The Pentax Coolpix 7000 is impraticable in them. But, is userful for transport my smartphone safe..."
2,"I like it, but...","I like the pocket for extra batteries and the pocket for extra memory cards. I like the rubber tips on the zipper as well.What I don't like is that one of the zippers broke after (4) days of use. I have owned Case Logic products in the past and feel that I got a rare dud as I have always liked their products. I have emailed their customer service and will see what happens.I guess for $12, you just can't expect too much."
5,Well Made Camera Bag,This is simply a great sac for you small to medium sized digital camera. It has just the right amount of storage space for my needs and my Canon A590IS fits perfectly in the big pocket. I like the buckle in the front as it makes it seem a bit more secure. The included shoulder strap provides another way of carrying the camera in its case in addition to the built in belt loop. Overall a great bag for traveling and taking your camera with you wherever you go.
5,Great compact camera case,"I bought this for my Canon A1000 IS camera. It fits the camera perfectly. The zipper, plus clip, makes me feel like it is more protected. It has pockets for batteries and memory cards. Wonderful case!"
2,Bellagio mocha mix was like overpriced hot cocoa,"I usually buy Big Train Mocha Mix, which I love, but decided to try Bellagio's due to the price. Big Train's price keeps going up. I was disappointed with Bellagio's because it tasted like weak hot cocoa mix. My daughter also tried it and felt it was watered down and she adds xtra to hers. I will not buy this product again. I felt it was overpriced for hot cocoa flavor, but would of been a good deal for a mocha coffee mix if it would of worked for that."
3,"Weak, Neither here nor there.","I think I bought this mainly to meet my 25 dollar quota and it was on sale. Anyway, I found it to taste like very watery hot chocolate. I'm sure I'll find a way to drink it by adding coffee or some other hot chocolate, maybe just double the amount, but I don't want anymore."
4,A solid must-have,"After checking this book out of the library and reading some of it, we knew we had to own it. Kasson writes well for the serious amateur of the Wild West, and the scholarship appears solid. It's clearly a work of contemporary history-writing, in that Kasson is very attentive to how we re-tell our past to ourselves, how myths and celebrity develop. In this respect it resembles Paul Reddin's ""Wild West Shows"" (University of Illinois Press, 1999), which we also recommend. Readers who want to know what it was REALLY like on the plains will want to consult other books."
5,Great Maui Jim Sunglasses,"Had a pair of older model Maui Jim sunglasses that were about 5 years old at least and had seen better days. I wore then alot. I was lookikng for a new pair very similiar and light weight that were polarized AND looked great. Wasn't going for trendy. Well, if you have a smaller face and don't want huge oversized sunglasses, that are well made with great protection for your eyes, these are the ones!"
3,Ok product,"This works very well with ATT internet. The only issue was that the power button on the first one I purchased got stuck 5 months after I got it, but I'm still using it. I also purchased another as a back up because the price is pretty nice."
1,David Allen Coe/Live At Billy Bob's,I saw the Concert on HD Net so I thought I would buy it. First of all only half of the song was on theDVD. And yes it was the same Concert I did some research. Than the quality was so bad that it makes you dizzy to watch it. Would not recommend it to anyone.
3,A beautiful pain in the neck,"My wife and I loved this faucet set the first time we saw it. We were also stunned by the price! Nonetheless, a few years later we wound up buying it for a kitchen in a new house. We also moved it to our next house. Aside from its elegance, the real plus is the built-in filter tap. The entire effect manages to be beautiful, understated, and retro all at once. That's the good.The bad? Constant sticking problems in the spray head (wouldn't shut off), which we ultimately had replaced ... and with which we still had problems. Filters are relatively expensive. And the filter unit itself was fussy to get installed properly, and leaks if it isn't. (Ours wasn't and did.) Finally, from a usage point of view, separate hot and cold controls are NOT convenient in the kitchen, an expensive lesson.Overall - an expensive design whose quality ultimately didn't live up to the price."
1,"Great faucet to look at, but not to actually use","This is a very nice looking faucet. However, if you plan on using it regularly, expect about 5 years of use before something fails requiring either a visit from a plumber and/or expensive replacement parts, or complete replacement. On the positive side, the technical support people are very helpful."
1,Performance,The screen on my unit went blank after 2 1/2 years of use. Will not buy again. No way to fix that I can tell. Too many circuits to isolate and fix the root cause. Will sell for spare parts. 316-584-2783.
1,Biased and offensive insight into tattoo history,"Someone re-issued this book again??Tattoo is a weird book. It was originally published in 1933 and is a classic example of tattoo stigma. Page after page of made up ""facts"" about tattooed men and women and all the horrible things they do/are/etc. Please read this book only as an example of a historical viewpoint on tattooing, not as actual tattoo history."
5,Birkenstock Sandals,"While I liked the Sandals very much, I was unable to wear them due to theway they are made. I have bunions on both my feet and therefore my feetdo not lineup correctly and I cannot wear them."
3,A nice way to complete a collection,"So there's no way I'm ever going to buy these as actual comics. Wanting to complete my collection, the ""Essential"" series is a nice way to read up on stories that were published before I was collecting. (Indeed, in this case, before I was born.)This is cheaply printed and bound, (Mind you this is not necessarily a criticism) the B&W; art starts to hurt your eyes after a few pages. Some of these stories are so badly dated that they're barely worth reading anymore.If you're a fan, you need this, but don't expect any of it to surpass the mediocre."
2,"Looks cool, but it's disappointing","I snatched this one up when it first came out, since I had read reprints of some of this material in other places and wanted to see more of it. Unfortunately, the parts I'd read earlier (approx. the first 150 pages of this book) are about as good as it gets.The list of comics creators who worked on this series is impressive -- including Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, and Stan Lee -- but ultimately it seems like they were just meeting deadlines and paying bills. The Kirby stories are the best; some of the others were completely unreadable for me. I'm hoping the second volume of CAPTAIN AMERICA reprints contains better work."
1,A Real Let Down,Not in color and not in step with the original Captain America comics of the 1940s that I remember. Don't bother or waste your money on it.
5,Captain America is Great For Kids,"I thought this book had some of the best Captain America comics ever! They had great stories of good vs. evil, with patriotic Cap in the lead, and fantastic artwork by the late great, Jack ""The King"" Kiby. The Red Skull is a featured bad guy quite a bit, and he makes for excellent opposition against Cap. Finally, I like the length of each individual comic in the book. 20 pages is too long, and I like the 12-page format used in all but 3 of the Cap comics. Buy and enjoy the Essential Captain America Volume 1, then buy Volume 2."
3,"An OK Book, But Check Out........","This is a nice little book if you are a beginner on your search, but I really recommend Testimony of Light by Helen Greaves."
3,content not reflected by title,"i didnt like this book. have only read a few chapters. the content of the book doesnt seem to be reflected by the title. not written in engaging fashion, content not very interesting"
5,I will be buying from you again very soon!,The book was in perfect shape brand new and in better shape than originally stated!! I received my package within the time frame stated and I'm very pleased with my purchase I will definately be buying from these guys again! Thank you :)
4,Emotional guide,"This is a good book, offering many insights in children feelings and emotions, which are their primary way of communicating. It also provides information on how to comprehend them. Children psychology is one of the most crucial factor in raising children, so understanding their feelings and correctly deal with them will give parents some basic information on how to meet their children needs, as well as an easier every-day life. I would recommend this book as an introductory guide to parenting, but not as an only option (there is not one book for everything). Do read it, but do read other books as well to cover more areas (effective communication, child psychology, mind growth, etc.), which you will soon need as your child grows. Quite useful for first time reading and new parents..."
5,Well written and very informative book for parents!,"This is a very interesting and informative book.Its a good guide book to deal with a infant. I am parent for the first time and its helping me a lot to reshape my behaviour towards my baby. I am more calm, focused and less irritated when my baby is fussy or angry. Its because the books gives you insight about the infant mind which is otherwise difficult to read for ordinary people. So this is a must buy book for parents."
5,Good read!,A very good book. I am a first time Mom as well as an infant caregiver and I found this book to be very interesting and very insightful! It is a good read for any parent of an infant!
5,Read this book!,"The title of this book is rather misleading. It is not just about nonverbal communication, but rather an extremely insightful guide to forming strong relationships with your children. It is also a way to articulate the ways in which our own baggage as parents impact those relationships. I found the straightforward and intelligent presentation of the information refreshing after looking through so many ""Babies for Dummies""-type books that merely scratch the surface. Highly recommended!"
4,Expectations Too High But Still Worth Reading,"This is a good book for all new parents. I think it lays a great foundation for handling your children. It also helps you recognize how your infant communicates. I was just a little disapointed because I was expecting a little more. I felt the emotions could have been explained more and that too much time was spent on other topics which were not related to the title of the book. The book also focuses a bit too much on older children when you expect it to purely be about your newborn/infant. I am hoping to use it in the future as my child grows. Along with this book I would recommend ""Einstein Never Used Flashcards""....this is a brilliant read!"
2,"Seller mailed wrong product, then couldn't deliver the right one.",Seller mailed me the wrong memory chip. I contacted him and he said he would not be able to deliver the correct item. I offered to return the item received but he said to discard it.
4,I couldn't agree less,"I couldn't agree less with the other reviewer. The album starts with a wonderful rendition of ""Sunset Boulevard"" . Neither too soft nor too light. The two tracks from ""Phantom of the Opera"" were taken from the 2nd studio recording with John Barrowman as Raoul. They are IMO superior to the recording from the original London cast because unlike in the OLC production the voice of Christine doesn't overpower Raoul but has them on equal levels, which makes the songs a real listening pleasure. If you love musicals and a strong vocal performance then get yourself this CD. I highly doubt you will be dissapointed."
5,Simply amazing!,"Since I received my cd in the mail it is all I have listened to. I bought the cd knowing very little about John Barrowman and now I am a huge fan. If you are a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, showtunes or just theater in general I HIGHLY recommend this cd. Five stars!"
4,I like the selection of songs,"As always, John Barrowman has a wonderful voice. I like the songs he picked on this compilation. My favorite one is ""Sunset Boulevard"" and I always enjoy any song from ""Phantom of the Opera"""
3,it was ok,"Can't fault Barrowman for the singing, he's perfect as always, but the choice of songs were questionable as was the woman he duetted with (is that a word?). Her voice hurt my ears. Loved High Flying Adored. I'm not a Lloyd Webber fan, anyway, so I may be a little biased against this one. I bought it because it was Barrowman! Supporting my main man!"
3,Brief Barrowman,"A nice but too short CD. You would think if the CD notes are true, that requesting friends would have liked a full program of Broadway shows including some from shows he was not in but would have liked to and the way he might have sung them. Every singer finds even "" lost songs"" to which they add zip. This CD adds the thought- nice but not really exciting. I spent more time reading the notes than the time it took to listen to the CD.Better luck next time and try to find Broadway songs written in this new century."
1,Another nice looking box with cheap badly designed plastic toy inside,"The product is a big disappointment. There is a vertical plastic stick and 9 horizontal plastic sticks that need to be assembled. However, the vertical stick is a few millimeters too short so it is impossible to assemble all the planets and create a stable structure. So many corners have been cut that the end result is a useless toy. However, the book that accompanies the product is very good."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I hate to say it, but this is a gathering of dumb old saying, many of which I still find no humor in. Save your money, or buy any other book for readers over the age of 6. (Sorry, but I was really disappointed)"
4,Good Gift for Bikers,Most of these sayings are fairly common and others are just plain ridiculous. This book however is guaranteed to make you and your biker buddies smile. This makes a great gift for motorcyclists of all ages.
1,9 Steps,This CD had very little value in today's economy. There were a few good points but overall I was not impressed.
2,Too Fuzzy Flamingo,Product was returned b/c fur was coming out and was messy. Could be dangerous for a small child snuggling with it.
4,comfy,The wheel cover is very comfortable on the hand. it gets hot when the temps outside is hot. quick shipping and would order from this company again.
2,Disappointing,"Technically OK, but like all the videos in this series, it suffers from its removal from the theatre setting, being apparently made for TV. There is no live audience, and G & S doesn't seem to work without that.I enjoyed the performance of our local (amateur) Savoyards better than this."
1,What is a good cast like you doing on a CD like this?,"The title says it all. Why are so many singers with excellent resumes, excellent voices, excellent acting skills, and excellent reputations, recording this trash?Yes, there are a couple of good melodies on this, but that isn't much of a recommendation for a double CD. They sound as if they have been written by someone plinking around on the piano, not someone who has any kind of a musical education and not necessarily much of a musical ear. Most of the music is trite, and the songs are very repetative. Couldn't the title character have more than 3 melodies to sing through the course of the show?The lyrics make me wonder whether the whole thing is intended as a parody. Please. Are we being laughed at, insulted, or asked to laugh along? Or perhaps English isn't the composer/lyricist's native language."
3,"Great music, amazing performances, pity about the lyrics","The chief reason to buy this CD is for Peter Karrie's performance as the lead character. He is simply outstanding. It is amazing to me that this man isn't already an internationally famous star, though he is well known amongst Phantom of the Opera fans and has indeed twice been voted their favorite Phantom. This recording truly shows his power and diversity. What an amazing actor and singer. The rest of the cast is also first-rate, especially Claire Moore. The music is haunting with some lush melodies and appropriately creepy music. I wish it had been recorded with a full orchestra rather than with synthesizers, which give it a terribly cheap sound. The lyrics need a lot of work; some of them are frankly dreadful."
4,Not bad.,"This is pretty useful for checking out movelists for the various Pokémon. However, the information they give on stats is shaky, and sometimes actually incorrect when you do careful comparison between base stats for each creature. In general, the information is still in the ballpark, but the system they use can sometimes make it difficult to get an accurate comparison between two creatures without actually going in the game and leveling them up.Also, the book really needs a list of the various Natures and their effects.Overall, it's a nice purchase, though, and the hardcover is a great plus."
3,received in iffy condition,"i bought this for christams used and soon learned that it would not have the 3D pictures of charmander, bulbasaur, and squirtle. Merely a tiny picture of all the pokemon in no order on the front and back cover. I also received one with a ripped open corner. Don't buy it used."
3,Pretty good,Only the 3rd full 12 string pack I've tried. Usually I mix 6 pack sets to get the feel I like. So far so good.
2,Hard rock with various influences.,"Kind of hard, rock and blues and country, these guys would be a huge live sensation in this town. I can't say they don't play or sing well, nor are their songs poorly written. But it's just not my cup of tea - for me, this one's a total bust."
3,wtf?,"I'm a fan of Gordie's last band, Big Sugar, and at least half of the titles on here are Big Sugar songs. ""Ride Like Hell"" in particular is a great track, but I don't like the recycling."
4,A rip-roaring whirl of a ride . . .,"This book takes us far beyond the gentle shaking that awakens many Californians in the early morning hours. Instead, it thrusts us into the catastrophic quaking that makes us fear for our lives and question everything we've ever been told to do when an earthquake strikes! The human stories are wonderful, and overall, I'd say, very simply, READ THIS BOOK!"
4,It's bigger than my mac mini,"This is a nice drive, and, like the title says, it is bigger than a mac mini, though not by much. Has been working just great."
5,Works flawless with my Mac Mini,"Look around for a while to find a burner for my mac mini. I had a cheap plextor drive the said it was compatible however I never got it to burn a working dvd, even with toast 8. This drive cost a little more but it was well worth it. I plugged it in and that was it...no configuring for the ilife suite. Now I can use imovie and idvd with no problems. I have a cheaper dvd player that has a weak laser so I was suprised when my new burned dvd's worked perfectly on it. Great burner I highly recommend it"
2,Not happy with quality of cover on this book,I know this is a used book but the it was in pretty bad shape. Because of me reading mostly Zane Grey I am used to reading used books because find new is not easy. And this one is in the worst condition of any I have but that go without getting a cnance to handle the book before buying. I have a couple of used book stores close to where I live and could not find this book. To bad for me because thjis book is so bad. The story will be good but will have to hande very gently. Again because 99% of the books aI read are used I do know how to handle books.
2,Don't buy it for the articles...,"The pictures are interesting but I'm sure there are better. The text is boring, and uninformative. The book is poorly organized. And the title is misleading. The earliest dated pictures are from 1880 and the latest are 1940s. To many pages are taken up by striptease series.That aside. There are some hot and interesting shots and for the price it's no bargain, but not a rip-off either."
2,To expensive for what you get.,"This is really sterling silver, but the back side of the jewelry is carved out. It reminds you of jewelry I used to get out of the 25 cent gum ball machine."
3,200 watt GE bulds dimmer than they used to be,"These new type packaging GE 200 watt bulbs produce 20% fewer lumens than they did two years ago.They draw the same number of watts, but produce less light.I wonder not only why, but what was done to the bulb to reduce it's output.Did GE do this to increase the lifespan? Or is it just due to China's lower quality manufacturing methods."
5,great transaction,"Just what I was looking for, this was a hard to find video. the video was as described and sent in a timely manner"
4,A must-have for anyone interested in hiking.,"I've only been hiking for about 3 months now, but this book has brought me great enjoyment when I'm not on the trail. It's got lots of practical advice and the authors can actually write. The stories told as illustrations continue to whet my appetite for sights as yet unseen. Using the practical advice from buying boots, to how to tie them has been invaluable. My more experienced hiking buddy was impressed with tidbits of trail knowledge I've shared with him from this book. He had to have it."
4,"Good hardware, bad software","I purchased the Creative LiveCam Notebook Pro to complement my Skyping with several of my friends who also have webcams. It works quite well for this. Integration with Skype is as easy as it should be, the image is of a good quality, etc. Having the ability to manually focus the webcam is nice compared to cheaper ones I've used where that was not an option. The clip that clips the cam to the top of the screen works perfectly on my laptop screen. The device is impressively small.My one complaint, and the reason I gave this device 4 stars instead of 5, is the included software. It was a pain to find/download/install (Vista users: You'll have to use the updated driver on creative.com) The software itself is pretty clunky, and has crashed several times. Also, every time a program uses the webcam (flash, Skype, etc) a window comes up to let you adjust settings on your webcam, which is much more annoying than helpful.Overall, though, it's certainly a good webcam for the price."
5,Love's to take pic's,I bought this camara about three weeks ago and I love it. It took a few days to figure out all of the features. I was having some problems with the exposure while taking action shots in the gym using the shutter priority mode....pic's where dark....I called sony support and within 5 minutes I had the solution...tried it and it worked. The picture quality is awesome. This is my second digital and by far the best. This camara does not limit you to just point and shoot which is the best feature. I bought the wide angle lens took some awesome scenic shots. The night shot is another great feature. You may not use all of the features right away but when you master the basics it allows you to grow and try new techniques.
3,Great pics when working...,"After 2 years of great performance and over 5000 pics taken, camera started taking blurry, like in thick fog covered pictures. No matter what mode, pics are unusable.Unfortunately, my problem is not covered by recall, so Sony rep told me. Somehow they were able to estimate repair cost over the phone ($ 185). I didn't expect my camera to quit working after two years, that is why I chose well known brand and paid lot of money for it. I am not paying for repair. At the moment, working F717 is worth about $300, so it doesnt make sense to invest any more money into it. I am very dissapointed with Sony and I understand that they don't really care about loosing one customer, after all they have so many...I am doing research for new one, so far Olympus E300 looks very good to me. Can get it for about $600 fairly equiped.Good luck to all F717 owners. See you later with different brand :-)Martin"
3,"Wow I did not know, I do now!","I got my 717 in Dec. 2003. in the U.S. I have taken about 5000+ photos, with no problems! 3 days ago, I went to take a pic of my son and the screen looked like a wet painting that ran. I reset the cam. and recharged the batt. and it was still the same. I'm here in Europe right now, so my wife called the big Sony store. The guy said he never heard of this before, but we can send it for service. When we took it to the store the kid said, ""sure these have problems"" it's costing me approx. $80 just to send it in, and they my or my not charge for the repair. Only now I found all these other stories. So the jury is still out, I don't know what I'm in for? 5 stars for the cam. 1 star for it taking a %&""$"
3,Sony will still fix the fog issue.,Cam started taking foggy pics after three years. Called up Sony and they said it was something about a lens out of line and they would repair it totaly free(shipping as well). Pretty good customer service on Sony's side.
2,"Great, but...","Very happy with the camera for about 3 years.It is now dead as it shows white fog on any picture, asny setting.Sony will not cover that problem even though there is a settlement about the same CCD chip, but not the same problem.Good bye Sony, Hello other brands."
5,Great semi-professional camera,Pros: Excellent quality. Exceptional feature list.Cons: Not good as your first digital camera. It is big and heavy.No matter what this camera will give you an excellent picture quality.If you don't mind the size...It is one of the best cameras on the market.
3,Great Camera For The First 3 Years,"I bought this camera in March 2003 and it has taken many great photo's. Suddenly, in late 2006, some photo's all had the ""white fog"" problem and it soon completely failed with all photo's having the problem. I just found out today that this is a known problem and am trying to get a repair. I do like this camera - when it works, it does everything I want in a digital still camera. If I can't get it repaired, then it's bye bye Sony. Wish me luck."
4,great camera for a pro,"I spent a lot of time getting up to speed on this camera. Although it takes extremely good pictures and would be great for a pro, it is not for me. You have to use both hands for most pics. The zoom feature is on the left side of the bulky lens, for instance, while the shutter release is on the r/h front side of the camera, making zooming in and focusing a tiresome task. It has too many features that you pay for, but which are not easy to learn to use. In fact, most of them you would probably never even use if you were a family man just taking pictures of family activities. I took it back after owning it for a week & exchanged it. However, If you are a true camera nut or a pro, stick to the DSC- F717. It really is great, it has a great many pro features not found on less expensive cameras."
3,Songs,Standard newly recorded 1990's versions of some of Lionel Bart's memorable tracks.Bart!Blitz (Musical)Maggie May (1964 Original London Cast)
4,where is the love?,"you feel the love of oliver...the desparate need of his love...right from the beginning and how he eventually makes even those who don't want love in their lives to open their lives to his goodness...lionel bart's score is probably one of the most brilliant ever written....and though it is a compilation cd...it needed more of anthony newley.....newley and bart were as one in their feelings and their talents for the musical stage...and they both made incredible contributions that will live forever...this cd weakens that force because it lost its control..it's love..somewhere....i'd do anything to hear newley sing lionel bart..period. their music was food...glorious food. when you want to hear an englishman's music...sung by a one of his peers..who do you turn to? to tony, of course."
3,Interesting but academic,"Zalewski brought up a number of interesting and very innovative security situations and possibilities. The statistical derivation of content based upon CPU utilization, is something I had never even considered... but at the same time it looks like it could be more work than someone would be willing to invest. The writing style is also slightly academic. A fair amount of time is spent giving background and information about a topic when those who may see the situation will probably already understand the history. I will have to admit that this was not a page turner, but I am very happy I bought this book. It was just a little difficult to get through at times."
3,Interesting,"This is one of those books that you go HMMMMMM!!! Very Interesting, but most of the things in the book are hard to understand. Also, he jumps around alot like if he's having a conversation rather than an inside manual to Attacks."
3,Second in the series,"This book is the follow-up to Turnbull's equally strong work on the Teutonic Knights and their castles in Prussia. The book nicely covers the history of the coming of Christianity to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and the resultant need of an armed force to protect the clergy. The cut away drawings of a Convent Castle, Riga Castle and a Gun Tower are excellent. My only gripe is that this book, easily, could have been incorporated into the first volume. It only has 60 pages of real informational content."
3,Careful! Helicopter propellers will disengage!!,An ok set to give to a typical boy who will destroy them in less than a week. Not recommended for any child (or adult!) who has not yet passed the point of sticking small parts of objects into nearest available orifices.The firetruck ladder and helicopter propellers easily come apart from the vehicles posing a possible choking hazard to small children and/or pets.
1,Threw the book away - and I never throw books away.,"If I had wanted Bible thumping, I'd have bought a Bible. I thought I was getting a fairy tale, but was instead getting a good Christian book produced by a Bible company full of scriptures.Not what I thought I was buying. There's a place for everything and I'd rather people be more up front in their advertising."
2,Did not notice any effects,"I read a lot about how this form of Tyrosine was supposed to really help you concentrate and get through stress.In my experience, it does nothing noticeable. I tried it in one dosage in a day, in several doses in a day, and in a dose times 4 to see if I could get some sort of effect at all, but nothing.This form of Tyrosine is supposed to be directly available to the brain, but I think anyone would be better of just supplementing regular Tyrosine, and letting your body synthesize the necessary tyrosine for your brain, rather than paying extra money for this."
1,useless vitamin,"I used it for over a month and could not feel any change at all. not sure if the vitamin or manufacturer is the reason but, I won't try it again."
1,Misleading title,"This is not belly dance music. It sounds more like porn music, funky, hip grinding stuff that has nothing to do with Middle Eastern music. How disappointing."
4,Latin American Baroque Music,"One of the things that European explorers brought with them to Latin America were musical traditions, mostly surrounding the church. The local population was taught how to play these religious melodies, but over time, brought their own influence into the music that produced a wholly unexpected genre of music that is only now being explored. Each country in Latin America where the European religions were ""introduced"" has developed musical styles that mimic European baroque music, while introducing decidedly Latin influences.This CD stays more towards the European styling of music, as opposed to the Latin, but still presents a wonderful collection of what can be best described as a fusion between music from the old world and the new."
3,Just another review,"ok, no one needs to take this review personally, so if you dont like it, do read it.Anyways, Im not saying this band is nothing without Brian, but I havent seen much pointing me against that fact since he left. The new album was awful in my opinion. It was filled with uninspired guitar riffs, fieldy lost his signature sound, david did his most boring drumming to date (see 'coming undone') and most of all, Jonathan's vocals were amazingly gay. the lyrics dont make sense half the time and he sings like hes hopped up on speed.From any performance i've seen from Korn since Brian left, the band has done very weak. I completely disagree that they have more power and presence. Jonathan barely moves, Fieldy just sways and Munky doesnt do anything anymore. The lack of energy onstage baffles me.Also, if i see one more person dressed up as a horse or rabbit onstage, i'll give up completely on this band, who ive been an avid fan of for almost 10 years."
5,Excellent DVD!!!,"I am a guy that watches a lot of concert DVDs and I have to say that this is one of my favorites I have seen. The sound and video quality is just incredible and you really do get that concert feel. I think the best thing about this concert is that is basically their ""best of"" collection, at least to the general audience. Of course there were some songs that were left out that die hard fans would have liked to have heard, but I am overall impressed with this. I think there wasn't a time when I wasn't dancing in my living room with the volume practically full blast! You just can't keep still watching it. It is a really fun thing to have in your collection, especially if you are a fan!"
2,Beginning of the End for Korn,"This is that last album with anything I want to listen to. Still wasn't great, but looking at what's been out since it ain't all that bad."
4,"Great for learning and decorations, not for covering entire cake","I think this is great if it take it for what it is, boxed fondant. The consistency is great for learning, and it holds well for making decorations. I would not use it to cover an entire cake. I think home made marshmallow fondant is the best for that (better than other brands advertised by celebrity bakers). I disagree everyone that says it tastes horrible, although I have only tasted a small piece. It takes like what it is, sugar."
4,Masterflow,Essential solo piano ruminations from one of history's most articulately accessible players.
2,Does not Deliver,"The author spends a lot of time talking about mundane things. If you are looking for a feel of Berlin during the war you will not get it here. I realize that these are the memories of a child, but the author is now an adult; I found it shameful that she had no bettter insight on why her jewish father had to leave Germany. The book seems to jump around in a random fashion with little information on what was happening in Germany, and too much information on her petty and selfish childhood thoughts."
5,This works!,"I had pretty bad yellow teeth and wanted to try something on my first step to try to get rid of the yellow. I'm not disappointed at all! I saw results in less than two weeks. I brushed my teeth twice a day with this product. I could say by the 10th day using this I saw results. I was brushing but not looking at my teeth the first week just so I can really notice a difference, and I did see it! I still drank coffee even after brushing and my teeth looked better than before I started using this product. I highly recommend it for smokers as well."
4,I love it!,I just got this yesterday and loved it! I agree that instructor Annie Lee does seem a little nervous and has some cue mistakes but as an overall workout it was great. They take the time to stretch after major muscle groups are worked and I think that will help to decrease soreness. I lost about 20lbs with the Firm about 4 years ago and am hoping that this and a few of their other dvd's will get me back into shape in no time! Always a Firm believer!
3,Good for light days,"I use this DVD on sick days or ""beat up at work"" days. Good for beginners, or as a easy toning tool."
4,No dance skills required!,"Many of the Firm videos require a lot of coordination... this one does not. Annie is a crazy buffed woman (is that even natural?) that definitely seems nervous a few times, but overall does a decent job with cuing. There's not anything really new in this video but I like that there is no dancing. It's probably not in my weekly routine, but maybe throw it in the DVD player every couple of weeks to change things up."
2,Boring and Easy,"Just like another reviewer said, this is way too boring and easy. I feel I'm wasting my time when I do it. Most of the The Firm stuff I don't like anyway, even though some of the newer ones I can tolerate. This instructor is actually pretty nice and not as annoying as some of the others, but the workout is too lame, even with heavier weights."
1,BORING!!,"I have been doing The Firm workouts since 2001 and have loved almost everything they have put out....this workout would fall in the not so great workouts. I found that there were way too many breaks in between sets and found it too easy, even with the increase of weights. It didn't even raise my heart rate that much. If you are just starting out, this workout would be great, for those who are more intermediate or advanced, I would save your money!!!"
4,"Different from the other Firm videos, but just as effective","This is a much slower, concentrated workout with weights.It's not a bad video as some reviewers are saying, it's just a DIFFERENT type of workout.It's more focused on moderately heavy concentrated compound lifts, rather then cardio splits with light weights.It's not as fun as the other more fast paced firm videos with cardio segments, but it is still just as effective in it's own way.Annie Lee is all about form, and you will see that in this video. I appreciate her effort to remind us of how important it is to exercise safely for LONG TERM results.Since the movements are slower, you can really heavy up the weights on some of the exercises, as long as you maintain perfect form."
4,very nice workout with some interesting combos,"I really liked this one! I think it is perfect for advanced beginners or intermediates. I especially liked the way different moves for different muscle groups were alternated, allowing me to rest one group while exercising another. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that the instructor, Annie Lee is a bit too nervous ( especially at the beginning ), what causes her to make some cueing mistakes."
2,Too Easy,This workout is too easy. It was originally offered in the TransFirmation series. This is the only video that I do not like from that series. It is boring and very easy. You will outgrow this video very soon.
3,A beautiful watch,"This watch is beautiful and stylish, and the price is exceptional. the only thing that keeps me from absolutely loving it is that the clasp is extremely stiff and it is very difficult to put on and take off the watch. I actually have to pry the clasp open with a screw driver in order to get the watch off. And sometimes I have so much difficulty closing it that I give up, only to find the watch dangling precariously from my wrist a few hours later."
4,It fell apart.,I've been studying with this book and it's very helpful in my work toward learning more chinese characters. I love this book. It contains 288 characters.The only aspect that I didn't like is the binding on the book which has now officially fallen apart because of so much use.
4,Really fun book!,This is a really neat book to just browse through. It is interesting how Chinese characters evolved from their ancestral forms.
1,fraudulent drivel,"The book is an insult to all of the hard-working people indevelopment who rely on their good taste and hard work to get ahead.As someone who has truly worked his/her (I'll keep my gender neutral) way up the development ladder, I feel it is my obligation to warn anyone gullible enough to believe this book will help land a glamorous Hollywood career. Do yourself a favor, work hard, trust your creative instincts, and learn from Hadley's mistakes."
1,To the mother of the D-Girl,"Like everything else about Ms. Davis' resume, even that ""plum tv job"" appears to be false. Friends in tv land tell me that Hadley is hardly the ""staff writer"" she claims to be, but actually an assistant to a writer. Again, big surprise coming from a woman who claims that Tina Brown has her old ""office"" where Hadley was an assistant. Do cubicles have Central Park views?"
1,A stupid book,"There are much better books out there for people who are trying to break into the motion picture or television industry. William Goldman's book of course, comes to mind. Also, Dawn Steele's book provided some interesting insights and advice as well. I think that what it comes down to when you are looking to break into an industry is the advice and suggestions you are given. And its the wise person who listens and takes the advice of those with intellect and experience. If some readers feel they found it here, perhaps it is because they are silly, giggly, superficial and (I'm sorry to say) stupid as the author. For all of you who feel MTV equals brain power, this will suit you just fine. People with a bit more substance (and no trust fund to their name) will most likely find this book offensive."
1,"Let's face it, the book sucks.","The reviewer from West Hollywood takes the most pretentious, pompous tone of them all, telling everyone to just calm down, etc etc etc. Face it, the book is awful. No, the bad reviews are not about Hollywood jealousy. The bad reviews are about reviewing a bad book honestly. The reason, I believe, the reviews take a personal tone is that the book is written in such personal tone. Ever meet someone who makes you vomit? Ever meet someone who makes you roll your eyes? That's what this book brings out in the reader. It's just too personal a take on the experience-- and it's the voice of this annoying girl that are making readers gag or take offense. That's what this book brings out in people. Maybe if the book was just slightly more objective in writing, so would the reviews."
3,Previous review may be a warning,"After seeing the previous review from someone who attests to really working as a development person and questioning the authenticity of Hadley Davis' voice, experience and expertise, I now question the book. Is this akin to a nurse writing about how to be a doctor, or a secretary writing about how to be an executive? I'm sure much of the information presented is accurate, but I now question the level, quality, authority and authenticity from whom it comes. In a sense, I question if this is fair to the reader."
1,Shallow advice most everyone already knows,"The glossary in this book ""defines"" such arcane industry terms as: script, delivered, at the end of the day, manager, shop, hot, buzz, heat, the business, the industry, box office, schmooze, etc.Her entire definition for ""the business"" is: ""Is there any other?""But ""the industry"" is so well covered by the media, most farmers in Iowa probably already know most of what's in this book. Nothing in this book a few episodes of ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, or a week in front of E! won't explain.WANNABE is a far more insightful true-life book on the life of an ""industry"" temp, and Rob Long's CONVERSATIONS WITH MY AGENT is a great inside look on sitcom writing.Take away the ""glossary of definitions"" and Davis' book barely comes in at 150 pages. Less, since much of the book is filler and happy talk and blank pages and cutesy drawings.If this book has rave reviews, it's because people like to see their name in print, and Davis name drops and praises no end."
1,stop the insanity,"Can we please all agree to a ceasefire! Yes, D-Girl is a useless book written by a pathetically unqualified woman, but this is Hollywood, folks. Since when is talent rewarded? Give her some credit for not letting an utterly unspectacular career stand in her way. Franky, I wish I had her flair for shameless exaggeration and opportunism. She parlayed a silly little assistant job into a stupid little book, then hitched her wagon to a writing partner with a fancy TV job. Such flagrant self-promotion is nothing to sneeze at.I guess karma is a boomerang, though, since Davis got axed from the show a short time later once they realized who the real talent of the pair was. Still, I don't have a book deal, and I have a lot more to say than Ms. Davis. But I guess that's not saying much."
1,What a weak book!,"You won't get anything useful out of this... it's an empty, moronic book written by an apparent airhead who has nothing to offer other than glamour tips. Where's the real info? It's like reading two hundred pages of articles that weren't good enough to make COSMO. Whatever you do... STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!"
1,Buyer beware!,"The reader in Massachusetts has a good point. What use is a how-to guide when the author is such a flagrantly dishonest individual? When I worked in ""the biz"" in New York, Hadley was unaffectionately known as ""Hadajob"" for her series of lateral, entry-level moves. Perhaps the reason the book is so empty and silly (although, I must confess, I actually couldn't get through it)is because the author never got beyond the cubicle. Instead of a chapter on something truly helpful, say advice on honing scriptnotes, we get tips on xeroxing. As they say in writing programs, write what you know.I suggest Ms. Davis try her hand at fiction next. Not only does she clearly have an overactive imagination, but, judging from the number of positive reader reviews here, she is obviously quite prolific."
1,A silly and self-important book,"The reviewer who called this something like a peach on a hot summer day surely must be joking. I was curious what the truth of this book was about, since all the reviews here are either unbearably flattering, or all out negative. How come there was no middle ground? Since I don't know the author and therefore am neither a friend or foe, I decided to find out for myself. Sadly, I agree with the thumbs down set. I have a sneaking suspision that some of these overboard rave reviews are written by the author's friends. This a very slight book. And I regretfully agree that there is far too much in here that is vapid, shallow, and stupid."
5,Fascinating. Universal truths.,"1. To respond to the negative reviews, let's remember this book cost but ten dollars. 2. Don't know much about doings in Hollywood but mostly every revelation is true of our local Civic Theater."
3,Hmmm,"Everyone is willing to leave a comment, but no one is willing to attach their name. I can't claim to be ""someone"", but I can claim to have read the book. I found it to be superficial and probably wouldn't be extremely helpful in landing any type of job that you would REALLY want to have, but it has a certain humorous twist to it that makes it an enjoyable read. It is suppose to be light, funny and not really taken seriously, a kind of beach read, if you will. Apparently, the humor is lost on all of you so much smarter, hardworking and clever ""someones""."
3,Why kid yourselves and call the BOOK shallow?,"It is clearly a shallow industry and anyone who thinks that style is not essential has probably not worked in ther business, and if they have, probably just looked like everyone else and never thought about it. I read the book and thought it very distinctly reflected the various experiences that I had in the movie biz. I left the business feeling ashamed of a world where assistants get lattes and d-girls live with a wildly inflated sense of importance and glam. Why blame the book for being honest rather than the industry for being shallow? Why pretend that Hadley can't write when she is obviously clever, cute and concise."
1,Dumb and dumber,"To the reader from West hollywood who asked everyone to take a breath and calm down... well, I still think the book's awful. I bought the book before reading all the reviews, and now I wish I'd read the reviews first. an insulting book."
1,Bubble-gum about popcorn,"Ms. Davis' guide is scary in what is values as important, but then so is L.A., so it seems. Perhaps this book is the most appropriate introductory guide a person could have, because it serves as a strong warning: Beware! This is out there, and a lot more of this is in show-biz than another-biz, so perhaps you ought to listen to Ma and Pa and look into another-biz. I found the whole thing repulsive and depressing, particularly because I am in show-biz, not owning anything by Prada. People should hand this book out at the gates of hell."
1,Give me a BREAK!,"I'm sure that a Rolex, some Prada accessories, a personal trainer and a date were able to get Ms. Davis anywhere she wanted to go! If you want to know about development, I suggest reading a book that goes beyond Davis' superficial look at what it takes to be a ""D-Girl""."
4,Glorious voices and good comedy,"Refer to the reviews that actually review instead of talking about their feelings, and my opinions are similar. The Opera World version of The Mikado is one of the picks of that series and infinitely better than any other version I've seen - and that would be just about all of them. We have excellent casting in most of the named parts except for William Conrad, whose elfin take on the part is cute but who manages to only barely hold on to the notes. But every time I watch, I catch another little nuance in facial expressions (watch for Peep Bo's sly little looks). And, best of all, the glorious voices of Nanki-Poo (John Stewart) and Yum Yum (Kate Flowers)! If I could find any thing else with Mr. Stewart's voice I'd snap it up in a heartbeat!"
4,A surprising production,"Who would have believed that Cannon or the Fat Man could carry a tune, but William Conrad isn't too bad. He may never win a Grammy, but in this production of the Operetta, he does quite a decent job. Even if you are not a fan of Opera, Gilbert and Sullivan is still easy to enjoy because their storylines are not as depressing as regular operas. Also, the English dialogue makes the story much more accessible to a wider audience. I look forward to the release of Pirates of Penzance, Linda Ronstadts version, of course, so that I can have two very enjoyable muscials available any time I wish. The productions may not be Hollywood lavish, but they are effective and entertaining."
2,Imitation of much better,"If you want accurate renditions of the venerable Gilbert & Sullivan, try to find the D'Orly Carte Company's version. They are the original company that G&S started and tutored to perform their operettas."
4,Tsk-tsk to the naysayers,"If you like the music and lyrics of The Mikado, this version is excellent. All of the main characters are brilliantly portrayed, including Ko-ko, Nanki-Poo, Poo-bah and Yum yum. William Conrad's voice is borderline, but his acting is fine. This DVD would be a bargain at twice the price."
4,My 2 year old loves it,"Cartoonish staging, amateurish costumes, some annaoying mugging for the camera but... THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES ARE TOP_KNOTCH"
1,Disappointing,"I decided that before I purchased this DVD, I would rent it, just to be sure it was something I would want to see again and again. How fortunate for me that I made that decision. This is a horrible production. The costumes are confusing and the choreography, bizarre. Nanki Poo with a trombone? Good grief. I'm still searching for a good production of The Mikado, because I would love to own it, but certainly not this one!"
2,Where Oh Where Is D'Oyly Carte?,"This is a very mediocre production of Gilbert and Sullivan's wonderful opera. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the singing and to the ""acting"" was mediocre at best. The production did not ""take us there"". Very disappointing."
3,Daniel Youngs,"I just received this video and have to say that on the whole it was very disappointing. The performances are very good, but the shoddy choreography and high shool-esque staging distracted greatly from the performances. Also troublesome are the glaring anachronisms throughout this production. I do particularly enjoy The Mikado, but this tape leaves much to be desired. Your money would be better spent on another production, or on a CD and the score."
4,batteries,One of 6 boxes ordered did not come with the full complement of batteries. Otherwise the batteries were as promised. Shipping was slow.
5,The best female theologian writing today,"Carolyn Custis James is the best female theologian writing today. She says in this book ""why are there no great female theologians?"" She is wrong - SHE is a great female theologian and every Christian woman ought to read this book, make sure her husband and pastor read it and then buy extra copies for all their friends to read as well. You will be seriously blessed if you read this fabulous life-changing book."
4,Wonderful listen...,"I've had this cd for over a year now and find myself CRAVING certain songs when it is absent from my cd player for too long.Not only is this great ""driving"" music, but there is such a range of moods from beginning to end that there is literally something for everyone-- I even used one of the songs as framework for the choreography of a dance. Each song tells its own story and has its own voice.""Maggie's Field"" is definitely a favorite on the cd, and one that lingers in my heart and brain time and time again... this is a true taste of the beautiful music of Appalachia."
2,More a collection of stories than a ture picture of the tribe,"I found that this book was more a collection of stories than a true examination or history of the people. It was written in a time when the standard for the use of language was hurtful. While that would detract from the telling of the history, that is not the flaw that makes the book less than stellar: it simply does not related the story of the Klickitat people adequately.The only ""virtue"" to this book is that no one else tells the story adequately, either. Probably the better sources of information on the Klickitats are the Ruby and Brown books such as:A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, 3rd Edition (Civilization of the American Indian)."
2,Another Mess from VoicePrint,"This was a favorite of mine when originally released on Vinyl.However, As with Animation, this CD version is not remastered from the original Master Tapes, but is in fact a transfer from Vinyl. The sound quality is horrendous.Secondly, most albums with bonus tracks place the tracks at the end of the original recording. For some insane reason they have decided to scatter these tracks randomly through the CD breaking the natural flow of the original. They're not even Christmas songs....Thirdly, They have replaced the original Anderson head on the picture on the back cover with a more recent picture!!!!. The rest of the photo is the same, just the head is different! It looks stupid beyond belief.This is another attempt by Voiceprint/Anderson to con the public. Shame on you all........."
5,A favorite Christmas album revisited,"My husband and I owned this on cassette and wore it out. I was delighted to see this 22nd Anniversary Edition of one of our all time favorites. Jon Anderson's voice is suited to the material and it's a joyful, uplifting album."
5,Harder difficulties make this one fun.,"Demon Attack is a shooter where you fight waves of flying demons.Yea, there's a level in Phoenix that plays sort of like this. However this is a really good version of that stage! Large demons shoot a huge swarm of bullets at you; while I'm sure this is just a large sprite with a bunch of dots, when this game first came out it really looked like they were shooting massive amounts of bullets.Depending on the difficulty and how far you've progressed, shooting demons will either destroy them outright or split them into smaller demons. Demons will also sometimes try to suicide into you, with a screaming sound effect.The background sound effect is handled well, and it increases in intensity as you defeat the demons on each stage.I suggest playing on the harder game modes (I like 7 best), which lets you see all of the game features quickly. On the lower difficulties the game is less fun."
5,Demon attack..,"i always thought that the games imagic made for the atari 2600 were some of the better titles back in the day because lets face it, the graphics for the 2600 looked bad and locked polish...but there was something a bit different about the imagic titles their graphics and gameplay were far better..case in point DEMON ATTACK. this game is a fast paced and intense shooter that gave your 2600 some serious action. i remember getting this and then phoenix.. and was like they are almost the same...who ripped off who? but anyway you slice it BOTH were fun. i still remember the tv commercials for this game..ive read that this was the first part of a ""trilogy"" if you will.. because, this led right into atlantis..then into cosmic ark .... 2 other great imagic titles..Demon Attack is still a winner even in 2011"
4,Well worth the price and viewing time,"Very funny. Candy and Levy play off each other extremely well. Loggia, as usual, is terrific in his tough guy role."
3,Silly,"John Candy is good in this film. After viewing this movie I thought that he should of made a film as a straight cop instead of a farce. Entertaining, good color, widescreen. C6"
4,Funny lines,"This was a great Candy/Levy comedy. They've worked well together for years.The most memorable comedic line for me was when the guards finished their instruction course. Candy said, ""Class of Thursday, 3:30.""Of course, Meg Ryan was great to watch, as well...."
1,ONE OF THE WORST,one of the worst movies I've seen for awhile. From Meg Ryan's bad hair to the lame writing. Sorry!
2,Mediocrity of a movie,"This film has a weak storyline of two men who become security guards due to several unfortunate circumstances. John Candy's humor and Meg Ryan's fresh face and style could not pull this movie from the ""abyss of bad scripts"". The direction also had a hand in making this cheesy film. I did however see a cameo appearance of the Brutally muscular Teagan Clive. At about 220 lbs of all muscle she was sexy to watch. She looks like she can curl a Toyota."
3,FAIRLY FUNNY CANDY VEHICLE,"John Candy is Frank Dooley, a cop unjustly fired from his job. Candy decides to become a Security Guard for Guard Dog Security. He is teamed with second-rate former prosecutor Norman Kane.On the job they find themselves mixed up in a plot with shady, mob-run Union reps led by Robert Loggia as the mob boss. They try to tell their story to a young Meg Ryan, daughter of the security company boss but she doesn't beleive them. Soon they find themselves accused of murder and on the run from the cops and the mobsters.Levy and Candy, two ex-SCTV alums have a good chemistry together in a kind of modern day laurel and hardy stlye. Not an uproarious movie but some funny parts, the best being when the pair hide out from the cops in a LA sex shop and Candy dresses in drag to escape the cops.A fun movie. Not a gem but some good bits."
4,A Comedy With A Few Surprising Touches,"This was a nice surprise. I figured it would be stupid and not all that funny. Wrong. It WAS funny.Yes, it's a harmless ""no-brainer"" type of movie but it was fun and had likable lead characters, people you could easily root for to make good. In this, it was a pair of security guards: ""Frank Dooley"" (John Candy) and ""Norman Kane"" (Eugene Levy).What also makes this above-average is that it is not just a comedy. There is action and suspense in here and the combination works. Believe me, this film is not all laughs.I watch this and makes me sad that Candy is no longer with us. He was a great entertainer."
4,Very Funny,One of the best comedys of the late 80s. In one scene..John Candy dressed as Divine and Eugene Levy in assless chaps(are'nt you the cheeky one)worth the price of admission.
2,Harmless and Wilded,"I was so glad when this movie came out on DVD, because I remember it as being so funny. However, it has not aged well. John Candy is great as always, but even he can't keep this turkey moving. Meg Ryan has a very small part as eye candy, but when was the last time Eugene Levy was funny? Too much here for John Candy to hold together. If you are a Candy fan as I am, see Summer Vacation instead. It's also out on DVD now."
4,Almost Perfect,"Pros:lightest notebook case I could find for my new T61, only 1.1 lbs. Lots of compartments and storage areas, well-cushioned compartment for the notebook, really well-designed in all aspects except one (see cons).Cons:No small handle on top of the case (only has the shoulder strap). How am I supposed to pull it out of the overhead storage compartment in an airplane without a handle? I had to pinch the top of the case and drag it out which was very inconvenient. So, my lovely wife cut off a small black strap from an old backpack and stitched that as a handle on the case. Now it's perfect. I bet Lenovo changes the design shortly because this is a significant design flaw."
2,Not great.,"Pros: Price, style, cushioned laptop compartment.Cons:- Shipping cost- No zippered compartments inside (messenger flap and front have one zippered pocket each).- No carrying handle- Not deep enoughDo not recommend."
5,Beautiful,"This book has some of the most beautiful photos of Mother Teresa. I learned so much about her by just thumbing through it. It made me want learn more about her and I could not resist going directly home from the local library and buying on Amazon. The words and the photos are all great. If you want to learn about becoming a better person, look at some of the life of one of those who lived best!"
5,what an amazing idea,"Frances Ruffelle is really clever and specific in what she wants, and what she wants us to want from her. This is what I want from her: genius. Her arrangements on old and new songs are so very her, and the choices of songs are perfect. An entire album of torch songs? Who would have ever thought of that, let alone historical ones? This cd represents some of Frances at her best: some of the best vocals of her career, best song choices, best arrangements. There is not a single bad choice in the entire album. I love Frances when she writes songs, but I absolutely love the way she interprets other people's songs. The songs have very simple arrangements, in their very rawest piano-based form, with a sprinkling of strings and maybe a clarinet. I could listen to her sing ""Sky Above the Roof"" and ""Moving On Time"" for hours on end. Well, done, Frankie Ruff. You're a Goddess."
4,Great thermometer for the money,"I just purchased this thermometer today to measure the temperature of my bearded dragon's enclosure. It is a great basic thermometer that seems generally accurate. The fact that it is only about $10 means it is affordable, yet the fact that it is accurate, digital, and easy to read means that it is a better buy than similarly priced thermometers without the digital screen. A reason I did not rate this thermometer a 5-star review is because it takes about 2 minutes to read the actual temperature. This does not pose a problem for me personally because the measuring probe stays stationary within my beardies enclosure. All in all, this product is affordable, easy to use, and accurate."
2,Broke within 6 months!,"This broke within 6 months; bought new batteries because i thought that was the problem but that didn't help. It's cheap and not even worth 5.00, I paid around 10 I think! I will invest more $ this time."
1,Off by 6 degrees!,"I bought this thing from a local fish shop 11 months ago. i also had analog thermometer for double checking the water's temp. about a month ago, it started malfunctioning and reads 6 degrees F cooler than the analog. had i not had the secondary thermometer, my fish would have been cooked. didn't last a year...makes me wonder how long these things are supposed to last?"
3,Good socks,I was looking for a specific Burlington sock. This isn't it but it's a good sock. I also ordered white socks but it has been discontinued.
4,Keef Rocks!,"I would have given it 5 stars, but the video quality is not the greatest.Great sound! Great songs. Well worth the money!!Highlight for me: Too Rude.Enjoy!"
4,Keith Richards Fan,"I've always liked the Stones and especially Keith Richards, with all he's done to himself it's a miracle he's still with us performing as good as ever."
3,"Moore sensational, Taylor disappointing","Claire Moore is superb on this album, which shows again that she is one of the most talented leading ladies of the London stage. The songs by Bernard J Taylor are mixed, with some appealing and enjoyable melodies but drab lyrics. I enjoyed this CD, but was left thinking ""When is she going to record some REAL musical theatre songs?"" Helping out an unknown composer is very admirable, but none of these shows are going to make it big on the West End."
4,The Queen of Musical Theatre,"For my money there's no-one to hold a candle to the divine Miss Moore. She has a voice that can do anything. She can caress you with velvety tones or pin your ears back with a belting vibrato. This wonderful collection of songs by Bernard J. Taylor gives her the chance to show her extraordinary range - from the darkness of Nosferatu to the belting ballad from Success and the unusual rythms of Much Ado. I would have given the album five stars if there had been a real orchestra providing the backing rather than synthesisers, but this CD is nevertheless a must buy for people who like great singers and great songs."
1,Claire Moore is great but the songs are poor,"I am a great fan of Claire Moore but this CD does not do her justice. Some of the songs are pleasant but mostly bland and the lyrics are bad. Claire, please record some Broadway classics!"
4,Sexy and Fun,"I really enjoyed this paranormal romance. It was a fun and very sexy read. This is the story of Private Investigator Desdemona who has a great life, a great boyfriend and a funny sweet and sexy best friend who is also her co-worker. He has been her best friend her whole life and she has some feelings for him that are more than just plutonic, but alas, he is married. Life is great. Then, sexy Frenchman Armand shows up and creates havoc in her life. She finds out she's a witch and she is meant for him.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a little magic and humor with their romance."
4,Great Company,"I fell in love with the characters in this delightful novel. They're a mix of eccentric and ""ordinary folk"" and the author portrays them so affectionately and with such appreciation for their oddities that you can't help but root for them as they do their best to manage life's ups and downs. What's especially good about this novel is that the characters all change in unexpected and heartwarming ways. I was sorry to leave them behind at the end of the novel"
3,Not bad,"I had high expectations for this book, as it was suggested along with Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe (a great book). Although the book let me down a little bit, I would still suggest it to anyone looking for a quick, heartfelt type of read. Although there are many depressing situations in the book, ie- the death of Tessie's and Victoria's husband, hatred shown in the civil rights movement, Charlie getting seriously injured in the Vietnam War, etc, the book as a whole isn't one that would make you cry and feel bad for the rest of the day. It's very light-hearted and touching in parts. Not bad at all as a whole."
4,The Orange Blossom Special,"The Orange Blossom Special begins Tessie realizing that her Chianti consumption is beginning to take over her life. Her daughter, Dinah, is not doing much better with more and more obsessive compulsive traits appearing each day. While Tessie knows she will never forget her dead husband, she and Dinah need a fresh start.In Gainesville, Tessie and Dinah must learn how to work, make friends, and just generally get through life. They meet all sorts of quirky characters that enrich their experiences. The story continues all the way through Dinah becoming an adult and is a wonderful example of the complexities of friendship and love.I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I loved the characters and could really appreciate some of the uniqueness of this story."
3,"Not bad, but lacks depth","""The Orange Blossom Special"" is full of quirky characters but most of them are underdeveloped or, in the case of Victoria, a caricature. The only character I feel that I got to know is Charlie. Whenever anything serious happens in the novel, the story moves ahead a few years or the problem is resolved quickly. The novel is fine if you're looking for a lighthearted read. The story did get better after Charlie returned home."
2,Disappointing in comparison with other boooks,"I was raised in Lancaster County, but have not lived there in thirty years. I've made more recent visits than usual, as well as extra attempts to get in touch with my roots, which include the Reformed Mennonite Church two generations back (sometimes called ""Herrites""). This book has some few beautiful photographs, and several lovely sayings -- but it seems superficial and communicates little useful information about the place and culture. A nice soundbite for those tourists with particularly short attention spans, but otherwise disappointing. I recommend checking other books under Lancaster, PA, and Mennonites, Herald Press, author Martha Denlinger. I consider most readers would be much more satisfied with something else."
1,boring and mainstream.,"I have to repeat boring and mainstream and if you watch mainstream you not going to remember this flick for long but to watch something boring is beyond my comprehension. Very simple movie with no real plot, exactly one chick undressing once and you start thinking immediately-go away, you, ugly and this is most exciting moment in all movie. As this movie is about Finland you dont see anything about Finland but this ugly chick and as I was planning to visit their country after watching first movie from series now I change my mind."
3,"Nice shoe, but not too comfy","These peeptoe wedges are really beautiful. However the angle of the wedge combined with design and the stiffness of the leather made for some top-of-the-foot pinchy-ness. I had to send them back because they were too uncomfortable for me. I imagine they might be great on a slimmer foot than mine. Also, I had to go up a half size--my heel went over the end on the pair I got in my normal size."
2,Extremely hard to follow,"While the introduction and the excercises are insightful, I couldn't get past the third chapter due to the jargon! Case study summaries aren't effective in helping the lay-person understand their emotions. This is probably a great text for an academic setting, but it's somewhat impersonal and less than engaging."
3,Not that helpful,Read the book. I tried the supposed exercises. What I've to realization is people need to develop more patience. You can never be too patient.
3,Transaction review,"Glad when I received the book which was in good shape, however, the shipping time was not adequate."
4,More than a little suspicious,"I haven't read the book yet, but I did read all the reviews. If you read the three reviews which awarded one star, you might just agree with me that they are written by the same person...someone with an ax to grind. So I award four stars just to compensate.I'm looking forward to the book, which I picked up today for 50 cents at the library. I'll revisit for a follow-up review."
1,Still angry.,"I read this book with high hopes. If you are looking for a practical book with great ideas, that will help you get control of your anger, and perhaps help you to realize that whatever is bothering you shouldn't...this isn't the book for you. I found the book to be over-simplified, with a demeaning child-like quality to many of the ideas and ""exercises"" it has you do. I was very unimpressed, and found that the only real benefit from the book came from the breathing exercises... Don't bother reading this book."
5,Facing Anger,"""When Anger Hurts"" is an excellent book. I had mistakenly believed that to hold in anger was bad for your health both physically and psychologically. Although I never got angry with my casual friends, my ""loved ones"" were not spared. I realized something wasn't right about the way I was expressing my anger. This book was an excellent source of information for me. It made me look at how anger is good if we use it to propel us to positive action. If you read this book, you will gain tremendous insight on what triggers anger. It will amaze you! This knowledge alone will help you to use your anger more effectively and appropriately. We need not make our lives painful. Holding onto anger and blaming only make our lives less joyous. This book will help you live a life that is more fulfilling. It will at least give you a wonderful start."
1,Typical self-help,"Although the book does give a few good pointers on how best to deal with your anger, I think that the best remedy is to seek a great counselor. As a therapist in training, we review many ""self-help"" books and although they are comical in their over-generalized answers, there is no substitute for a good therapy session. Real anger cannot be quashed by reading a self help book, and this book isn't going to offer you what you are looking for."
4,Listed Wrong,"This product is listed incorrectly. If you look at the picture of the cd cover on this listing, it says in the top right corner ""25 succes - 75 mn"". I'm no expert in French, but when I look on the back of this cd case I see 25 songs listed - thus ""25 succes"" sounds to me like 25 songs. So why are there only 18 listed on this site? Incidentally, the ones listed here, except for 2, are all on the cd I have. Strange. This site is listed wrong."
1,Doesn't Work!!!,The pedometer looks fancy in the picture but it is a piece of junk. Mine does not work at all and will not turn on. Check out other pedometers like Omron's.
5,A remarkable recording,"It is true that the motets are one of the most difficult works to perform. They are complex, extremely demanding on the singers, rarely sounding ""correct"" outside world's leading studios or concert halls. Sung by ""the local church choir"", they are bound to be disastrous. Not surprisingly, the music recorded on this CD is not flawless, but still it's a must for all those fascinated with Bach and choral music of any kind. The motets are just so beautiful - there's no doubt Herreweghe has made it again. All the pieces are at least as good as other leading renditions of the works, and in my opinion, 'Jesu meine freunde' excells over any other interpretation of the motet. Strongly recommended."
5,Great intro to the world of bellydance,"This is a great book, with tons of gorgeous pictures and info about starting bellydance. Rania is also gorgeous, but not in an intimidating way, so you feel like you could be just as sexy as she is by bellydancing. This book and the one by Tamalyn Dallal definitely have a place on my bookshelf now, and the CD that comes with this book, which is full of great songs to get you started, has an almost permanent home in my CD player."
5,It works great,"I was very worried about buying this product. Everything has to be perfect for this product to work. The Aqueon product line of tanks are well designed. This accessory is worth the money. Do not go out to the hardware store and try to build your own version. I know have a beautiful Marine tank. The price is high, but the product is excellent."
5,Phobia Free A Medical Breakthrough linking 90% Of All Phobia,"I Have been phobic for the last five years, i've been hospitalised and housebound. My phobias started on a day trip in the country with what I know now as a panic attack,it was the most frightening exprience of my life as I thought I was going mad and or had a brain tumour. After psychiatry, hypnotherapy,counciling and reiki healing. After numerous amounts of medication and none to my relief,my phobias incresed and I was desperate I could see no way out of this living nightmare. I got the book and finished it in an evening it was brilliant I'am now on the medication 3 weeks and everyday I lose a phobia its a miracle and I would just like to thank Dr Harold Levinson for giving me what i can only say is my life back--"
2,Not Worth the Money,"This book was ok but it contain very little useful information. I wouldn't suggest you get your hopes up when buying this book.The author does not discuss any physical problems, only phobias & panic. I expected to find information like pain in your ears, or physical symptoms of some kind. NADA, nothing. He suggests OTC meds but doesn't explain what to take & when or how. I know you need a Dr's advice but anyone with anxiety or panic knows that a DR is not going to listen to other suggestions for anxiety treatment."
4,"Ahh. A good movie due to plot, past, and cast.","At first, I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie as much as I did. The only reason i bought it was because of Adam Ant. But as the movie progressed, so did my interest in the story and how it would end up. This movie has a great story, good acting (which can be a rarity in most movies), and the great line from Adam Ant: ""I feel bigger with a trigger. ya know."" to sum it up, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up from a girly who normally doesn't like movies with a lot of bang bang shoot-em up."
1,A Truly Awful Movie,"The only reason to watch this low budget action flick is to see a young Sharon Stone, the movie itself is so pathetically inept I'm sure Sharon would like to delete this clunker from her resume, the screenplay and dialogue are so bad as to make one think a teenager made it up and the action scenes are mediocre too. If you want to see Sharon looking her best then give this one a look otherwise your 90 minutes can surely be put to better use."
3,"Ok, but not the best","The reason I watched this is because Adam Ant was in here and I thought 'cool, I gotta watch this'. It wasn't that good, though.He made a wonderful bad guy, but if you like the average cop movie, here ya go!"
2,"FLAWED, WEAK, UNDRAMATIC!","Flawed, weak, undramatic! That's all I have to say, except: Skip it! Grade: D+"
2,Cold Steel Used,The cover of movie looked old and I was disappointed as I was giving as a gift to my son.
4,Works,"My husband has been using this for 4 months. His SA before taking it was 17mil count, with 10% motility. After taking it for 3 months he did another SA that came back with 32 mil count and 31% motility. We're still not pregnant, but I think our odds have increased!"
3,Pills were all broken,We like the product (we have ordered it before from a vitamin store) but these were ALL broken up inside the bottle! Very disappointed in this retailer.
5,Wonnderful book!,"I'm from Belgium. I was on holiday, walking in Harvard campus when my attention was kept by this wonderful book...2 minutes were enough to convince myself to buy it and it was definitly a good choice!I'm an engineer and even if the content is more like ""basic"" maths for everyone intersted on the topic, I must admit it is a very useful and broad reference, introducing deeply all important in everyday's life math topics!Nevertheless, I found one little typo and would like some readers to confirm this fact : in the on the fundamental theorem of calculus, one assumption is that the area below the graph from a to x is called A(x), but on the graph, it is called Delta A(x). Can anyone confirm that it is a small mistake or that it has been corrected? Such a book deserves to be totally free of typos, especially for such an important part of the book: the fundamental theorem. Actually, it is a bit a pitty that such a theorem is not fully demonstrated, but that only dA(x)/x = f(x) is proved."
3,Misses many opportunities to make math more amazing,"I found it frequently tiring and prosaic. There is great beauty in the equations, per se, but the presentation did not bring this out.. For example, irrational number are astonishing- one would expect that all values could be represented by a ratio, yet the proof of the existence of irrational numbers was not given.. The discovery of navigation is astonishing, not brought out. Einstein's equations are astonishing, but the presentation and the significance is not brought out."
3,An exhaustive pastiche,"This book has a great deal of breadth, but, sadly, very little depth. It serves well as an aid to one's memory, but is not a useful book from which to learn.I'm not displeased that I bought it, but it is not anywhere near as useful as I had hoped it would be. It contains a lot of historical tidbits (and hence serves as a kind of an index to the history of mathematics), but also contains a number of imprecisions and, sadly, some idiosyncratic notations."
5,Patriotism,"While General Lee certainly had his flaws, a lack of patriotism was not one of them. It was precisely this profound love of country that led him to serve the Confederacy, defending Virginia."
3,hmm,"lesson # 1: break your officer's oath and lead armed treason against your country? (isn't america a wonderful place? if lee had been a primary figure in a rebelion against ANY other state, his head would have been piked! thank lincoln and grant for that.)if one can overlook the fact that this book ignores lee's most pitiful and destructive leadership decision, that of taking up arms against his own countrymen, his own fellow SERVICEMEN, i'm sure one will find it enjoyable.hypocrisy is lined up along the sidewalks. remember to wear blinders, walking through the town."
4,Quick But Interesting,"Although a quick read, this is a great introduction to both Lee the man and Lee the general. Crocker does a fine job of covering the many facets of Lee (such as his religious beliefs, stance on slavery and why he fought for the south) without getting too bogged down in intricate details. The only drawback is that this brevity sometimes undermines the books focus, expositions on Lee's leadership traits. Lee had many admirable leadership qualities that easily convert into the business world. The book covers these well with real examples of their application. However, more examples would have helped illustrate the author's point in spots.Overall, an excellent springboard for deeper investigation of one of the best generals any army or company has ever had."
5,Excellent insight into the man,Very well written. Lee's use of talent and limited resources reflect his brilliance as a leader.
4,Applying the lessons learned from Lee,"Rather than preaching about Lee's leadership style, Crocker details how Lee made decisions during the Civil War and applies those experiences to the business world today. The summaries Crocker provides at the end of each chapter help to focus the reader on the most important points made. The major themes focused on are setting and achieving goals, risk-taking, and personal humility and how they can lead to victory (in battle or business challenge.)This book is valuable not only to managers, but parents, clergy and anyone else in a leadership role. The lessons are straight-forward and easily applied to daily/business life. For those of us that are managers, our staffs and co-workers will certainly thank us for reading and applying the information. It is certain that any reader will come away with useful new ideas on leadership that they have not considered before."
2,Straight to the used-DVD bin,"This is utterly and spectacularly lame. Jim Breuer is a modestly talented sketch comic (mid-90's SNL) but excruciating at stand-up. Lots of yelling, mugging, and running around the stage but it just ain't funny, dude. We did smile at his spot-on AC/DC imitation, but that was the show's finale.Looks like most other reviews here are friends-and-family, with pandering quotes like ""You almost get exhausted by just watching him run around the stage like a madman. There is hardly a second that goes by where you're not laughing hysterically."" Rrrrrighht... My wife and I were so exhausted we switched to C-SPAN and got more laughs watching ""Prime Minister's Question Time"" in British Parliament."
4,Rolling on the floor,"I bought this DVD as an early Xmas gift for my boyfriend. I've never seen any of Jim's work but my boyfriend has. He said you'll be rolling on the floor when I watch it. As we watched it, I started getting stomach pains because I was laughing so hard. My favorite skits are the camel skit in the beginning and the ""Extra"" clip of 'My Dog Duffy.' Buy this DVD or VHS and you'll see what exactly I'm talking about."
3,Jim is better than this...,"I love Jim Breuer, so it pains me to write this...but DVD was a complete letdown. No cursing, no 'Faggot!' bit, and Jim seemed very restrained beause it was done for Comedy Central TV. The background band gets a little annoying at times.I made the mistake of buying this after I had seen him live at the Improv, and as you know, 99.9% of comedians are better live.""My Dog Duffy"", in the extras section, was the best bit. There were some funny parts throughout, but overall disappointing. O&A; fans will be disappointed as well. BTW, Norton rocks!Go see Jim Breuer live!"
5,Hysterical,I bought this as a present for myself after hearing him on satellite radio and recognizing him as Goat Boy. My husband and I watched it together and both seriously came close to wetting our pants! Jim is very physical with his comedy and his impersonations are head on (especially ACDC). I was also impressed by the fact that he is pretty clean (maybe 3-4 cursewords in the entire routine). Highly recommend it!
5,Breuer is the man!,Words can't describe how hilarious Jim Breuer is. His stand up is great and SNL skits are just too awesome.
3,"Good overview, but better maps out there","I got this map to show all trails in WMNF as part of my project to hike all trails in the Forest. While it shows most, it doesn't have some of the Mahoosucs. Also, it doesn't have topo lines. I'd recommend Map Adventures map instead.. which has about the same number of trails, but lists distances and has topos. The big difference is Map Adventures uses both sides of map for trails, where AMC map is just one side (other side is text/recommended hikes etc.) So if you want a map to hang on the wall, use the AMC map. For hiking, use the Map Adventures, or buy the AMC trail guide which has multiple excellent maps."
3,Not useful - missing trail mileages and parking lots,"This is a quality map - tear resistant, water resistent, easy to read. Roads are clearly labeled and even highway exits are marked. However, the map only has trail mileages for certain areas that are blown up as insets. Mileages for most of the Whites are missing. It also doesn't show parking lots. These are the things I need when I'm planning a hiking trip, so this map doesn't work for me. I would recommend Map Adventures White Mountains Map (not currently sold at Amazon.com)."
2,No latitude/longitude coordinates marked,"This map has No latitude/longitude coordinates marked. It is still made for pre-GPS era when people rely on compass to determine the locations. But compass is useless in whiteout conditions, which is a norm in winter. So this map is NOT very useful for hiking the presi traverse in winter time."
3,HELPFUL,"We used this for several day hikes this fall and found it a helpful way of selecting choice day hikes. The trail descriptions are very brief so its no substitute for a book. You have to carefully examine the map to see if there are water falls or other features of interest. As always, its really great to have a good map of the whole White Mt. region to ensure you don't get lost in an unfamiliar area."
3,"Smells great, works OK as a moisturizer (4b/c hair)","I typically love Aubrey Organics, so I'm sad to say that this product is just OK. While my hair (kinky Afro-American hair) initially feels and smells great, after the product dries my hair is left feeling crunchy and dry. I have a feeling that this may work well for a looser curl/coil pattern of hair."
3,Good for Kinky/Curly Hair,"I recommend this product for the use of a light curl definition and shine, but it is not very moisturizing. It didn't make my kinky curls pop either like Giovanni LA Styling Gel does. Dispite the description on the bottle it does flake lightly after a few hours after it dries (so don't touch), but it's not very noticable. I don't like the weat look on my length of hair, but on shorter hair or if that's what you're looking for this is the product for you. It does have a nice clean smell and good slip so you don't need a lot."
3,Not great for younger kids,"My three year old and I watched this together. We love doing yoga together, but the narration of this threw her off. Because the voice is a child, not a teacher, and because the voice is not connected to the video, it is hard to follow and feel confident about what's coming next. We didn't enjoy it and I wouldn't recommend it for children my daughter's age. Perhaps children older would enjoy it."
2,Not easy to follow,I've done yoga for more than 15 years but this was the first time I was introducing it to my five year old daughter to it and it was a disaster. It's not instruction but rather a vaguely creepy home movie with no pose explanation or preemting to give you a chance to help your child transition between moves. Frequently the camera is focused on the grass for no reason what so ever so you can't even see if you are positioned correctly.
4,Awesome,"To start this helmet is freaking awesome. I asked a WWII veteran in my town if it was WWII era and he said it was. Just a warning after a few days if wearing it around the house, you start to get stronger neck muscles because it weighs 4 pounds.One problem was the band and condition of the steel. I did nor get the band and there were a few minor cracks in the steel rim. The liner is adjustable but the buckles are old and one of mine broke. In the end that made it fit better."
5,Wrinkles and dry skin be gone!,"I have used this product for over 5 years. It consistently removes my areas of flaky dry skin, especially those around a blemish that is healing, without leaving me with extra oily skin. I look way younger than my same age peers because this product does what it says. The uva protection works well and it's not too oily. Give it 2 weeks. It is amazing what it can do for your face.Avon ANEW ADVANCED All-In-One MAX SPF 15 UVA/UVB Cream If you want a lighter version, tryAvon ANEW ADVANCED All-In-One MAX SPF 15 UVA/UVB Lotion. It is lighter and leaves your skin a bit less weighted."
3,Avon Anew advanced cream,"I felt I waited too long for this product & even though it goes on nicely, I don't feel like I have seen any improvement to my skin. Just another cream."
2,I hope you have experience...,This book is very cursory in coverage. It's too bad that honda will not release their shop book and parts manuals directly to the public. I rebuilt a 1969 CB 350 using this book and I was always going to the local dealer for help. Look elsewhere.
3,travel time,"helped my son alot with his motorcycle project, but took some time to get here.Do not know why it took so long"
1,"Save trees, do not buy this CD.","Alright so CDs aren't made from trees, but the CD insert is.I didn't like Taylor's Nosferatu. This, however, is worse. How can that be, you ask yourself? I wondered the same thing. Perhaps it's that this music is even more painfully trite, full of stereotyped mock-Shakespearan synthesizers. Message to the composer: they didn't have synthesizers in those days. Hire real musicians. If you aren't making enough from your CD sales to hire them, meditate on why this might be."
3,Umm..is he sweating?,"Okay, the goods first. The thing that saved my review from a 1 star is because I like how Peter explained in detail what to expect if you were to try and get involved in ""seeing the sight"". The lectures were very helpful as well, and I enjoyed his dorky sense of humor. Yet this gets a 3/5 (actually more likely 2*and a half/5) because this DVD put me to sleep. Peter did not move or walk around to make your eyes adjust or give it any candy by showing pictures or examples which made me bored. And he was profusely sweating from the very beginning of the DVD right to the end. I'm not sure if that bothers you, but it distracted me from paying attention to what he was saying. He looked a tad-bit uncomfortable too. I was like, ""Will somebody give this guy a glass of water? Or a fan?!"" in my head.Anyways, Good lecture. I enjoyed Peter's information very much. But I believe the DVD was much less worth $15."
3,Okay documentary,"This documentary was definitely okay and enjoyable, but if you like this topic and want to see an excellent documentary about this topic, watch "" Bastards of the party""."
2,Preaching To The Choir,"I was excited when I bought this at Amazon, hoping to get an in depth look at the Gangs and the history of L.A. Instead, I was treated to a barrage of one-on-one interviews with ""former"" gang bangers, and their portrayal of what it was and is to be Black and segregated. The fact this whole film was dedicated to blaming Large corporations for deserting Black Families and leaving them no other choice but to become Criminals, left a bad taste in my mouth. The up side to this movie is that their were a few instances in which the truth about innocent bystanders being caught in the crossfire were brought to light. Overall, it starts out promising, but becomes monotonous after about 20 minutes."
2,Crips and Bloods directed by Dave Chapelle,"That's right. This movie is eerily similar to a Chapelle's Show sketch. Do people see it for the parody it is, or is anyone actually taking this movie seriously?"
1,boring!!!!!!!,this just shows mostly the early 60s before the crips and bloods it isnt even about them just the old riots before them i shouldnt have got it its sucks
5,"Excuses, Excuses","I thought that if you always did what's right, worked hard and stayed out of trouble, you will eventually make a good life for yourself. I didn't have the money to go to college so I joined the Marine Corps, saved my money and got a college education courtesy of the G.I bill. With my college education and trade skills learned in the service, I now have a good job. This documentary is full of excuses why these kids are in the situation they are in. I know they had hard lives growing up, but why does that stop them from joining the military like I did and making a good life for themselves? Liberals will provide plenty of excuses as to why they are unable to join. What's the best way to make this stop? Quit enabling them with crap like this, and hold them accountable.Will someone please provide me with an excuse as to why these kids can't join the military, gain valuable job skills, and earn a college education?"
3,"Wrong Title, But Good Film","The film is less about the Crips and Bloods as it is about the social history of LA. The film was good, but again, just really was not a Crips/Bloods documentary. If your looking to learn about the gangs, this is not the film for you. If you want a good genrealy social commentary on why black LA is as it is, this is a good film. I feel the first half of the film does a great job, through interviews, of detailing why things happened (""riots"") as they did - from the black community point of view. I'd like to see this direction expored in greater detail, and a seperate film focused only on the gangs, i.e., history, structure, everyday life, economics etc."
4,Hard to believe it is for Real,"I just watched this documentary last week and I will have to watch it again this week as it was all surreal. I live in the sub-burbs only 30 miles away and had no Idea the meaning behind what was going on in the city. I think to myself, can that be real, or just another ""movie?"" That is why I have to watch it over and over again, to drive the point home. I both cried and was scared during watching this documentary. It is really incredible what these guys have been through and the subsequent mind-set that was developed. I think this film helped me understand my fellow man just a little bit better. So, In closing, if you consider this is real and not a ""movie"" this documentary might really move you. I really liked the deleted scenes and ""making of"" also."
4,Klein's Naturals Walnuts,"I was pleased with delivery timeframe. However, the Klein's Naturals Walnuts were OK but not as fresh as I had hoped they would be. I didn't like the packaging because the cellophane was loose."
4,Love these boots!,"I absolutely love the look of these boots. The rough and worn finish looks great with a pair of blue jeans. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they aren't my most comfortable pair of boots. The tongue is thin and I can feel the laces through my socks. So, I just make sure to wear thicker socks with them."
5,Totally surprised,"I love these boots. They sole isn't stiff hard but soft rubber exactly what I was hoping for. These have become my favorite pair of boots. Would I recommend them? uh, Yeah!"
1,Unsuccessful updating of some old hits,"The price is clue #1. Clue #2: no liner notes. Although these are the original bands who recorded the songs (although I suspect most have had personnel changes) they are here performing the songs 30 years after the fact, either in studios or in live venues. The only hit that has not been re-recorded is ""Wild Thing"", which seems to be off the original master. So consider it a nice, inexpensive CD single of the Troggs, with some extra filler."
1,Worst Seat I ever Used,"The seat says it is used for children 30 to 100 pounds. My son is 5 and is 65 pounds. It is too small for him. He said that he was very uncomfortable. It is alot more narrow that other booster seats. Bought it online and couldn't see the flowers. My husband was not too thrilled about that. It is not too sturdy. When you put it together, the back of the seat falls back. It will not stand straight up unless it leans on something."
5,Gorgeous edition,I bought two of these books as a Christmas gift for my second cousin's first Christmas. They are a gorgeous edition with beautiful and sturdy binding. They already have a coveted spot on the top of the book case.
2,"Good idea, poorly done","We tried to use this... Naw. If you have ever tried to get a worship team of amateurs to play along with a click track - you know thats pretty much impossible. The only other options is to use the ""karaoke"" track or just have the regular CD version of the song play. The images are phenomenal - the video editor who made this is very gifted - but the subtitles showing the lyrics to the song (the whole reason one would get this product) has only one setting - white letters very small.For such limited options available on the lyrical edge and the limited number of songs per DVD It seems a bit much to me. I have DVD A and will not be getting any others. Glad I got a deal on it at the Christian bookstore...My advice? borrow another church's to see it before you buy it. It might work for your church - it didn't for ours. (both regular services and youth services)"
3,Short 'no spoiler' review,"This is a fairly decent movie. An honest film that few will be able to call the ending of. If you are a Connie Nielsen fan she doesn't disappoint. There is one scene in particular though that makes the flick worth watching regardless. It's a moment of black comedy. There's a one-liner that made me laugh so hard I had to hit pause. Watch for it when a man is visiting an inmate in prison, and the guards are called out of the room. I will catalog this one-liner with the many great lines uttered in film, such as ""Charlie don't Surf!"", and ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"". The line from Convicted though is dirty. Very dirty. You have been warned. ;>"
5,wrong title,"this movie was released as ""Return to Sender"". I enjoyed all of it. Everyone was convincing, and I'm originally from Oklahoma."
5,Never thirst again,"A wonderful and insightful commentary on the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman in chapter 4 of John's Gospel. Provides links and readings to other writings showing the importance of wells and water in biblical times. My major ""AHA"" on this book was the way in which the author demonstrated how this encounter showed reconciliation in practice at three levels - between men and women; between nations and between God and humanity."
4,Animated World of Responsibility,"As always, Webkinz provides young children with fun, entertainment, and reponsibility as they play with and care for their virtual on line pet. The stuffed animal that comes with the on line access codes are collectable trophies for the kids, and are well made, durable, and attractive. Overall, a great idea for young kids and a safe on line learning experience. This Lil pug is so much cuter in person then in the picture!"
5,she has 2 pugs and loves this one,"she loved it, she has 2 real pugs and loves the webkins pug this was a great purchase thank you"
5,"Excellent article, but . . . .","As the author of this essay, I am astonished to find it ""for sale"" on amazon.com without my permission (and certainly resent someone else making money on MY labor). If you find my email online by doing a google search, I will send you a copy for FREE."
1,NOT Department 56,I am aware of the difference between the Dept 56 reindeers which were produced prior to 2006 and the new Patience Brewsters reindeers which are being produced NOW. I specifically ordered these from you because you stated they were Dept 56 and I am trying to complete my set of DEPT 56 Krinkles Reindeers. Your advertising is very misleading and I was disappointed to receive the newly distributed reindeers. There are slight differences other than the boxes and I am trying to complete an ORIGINAL DEPT 56 COLLECTION...that is why I purchased these from you. I expect that you will correct this situation so that I don't have to contact Amazon and point out your misleading advertising...as there is a difference!!I look forward to a quick resolution.
4,Supplemental Information for students,I used this book as a supplement for students who were studying child welfare. It was helpful. Good text to use to supplement in a class.
1,Propaganda,"Propaganda... It's not a book, Lehman Brothers lovers , Banksters from Wall Street will give 5 stars, not me. Dmitri Volkogonov was director of the arm of the Soviet military concerned with ""psychological warfare"", writing a manual on this subject for Soviet forces (The Psychological War)..."
1,this book is completly off the topic of lenin for a majority,"I had to read this book for a history project. why that it is titled a ""biography"" of Lenin, I do not know. four the majority of the time the author does not talk about lenin. this book should have been cut shorter or titled ""Lenin: and all of his people"".. it is a horrible book."
4,Very Nice,"This excellent-sounding release from Mapleshade is worth picking up for one incredibly beautiful and moving cut, ""Lotus Blossom"" by Billy Strayhorn. What tenor saxophonist Harold Ashby, pianist John Hicks, bassist Keter Betts, and drummer Jimmy Cobb are able to achieve on this tune defies my humble attempts to describe it. Nearly half the time is taken up by a soulful bowed-bass and piano duet of surpassing loveliness, then Ashby comes in with his horn, and things get even better. Jazz perfection!The clean sound captured by Mapleshade makes it all the better. There are some other good performances on this CD, but as I said at the outset, ""Lotus Blossom"" is worth buying this CD for just by itself--the other nice cuts are a wonderful bonus. Ashby has a big, breathy tone reminiscent of Ben Webster, plus a tender way with a melody that will draw you right in. His sidemen support him ably, making this a most rewarding recording that is best played late at night."
5,Perfect replacements,"I bought two of these and have had no issues with them. They worked right out of the box, no DOA's, no problems."
4,Not a full review,"2nd time I replaced the bad power supply in an old computer. The last replacement, also a Logisys, lasted a little over a year. Although this power supply got the old computer to power up, I still could not get a full boot completed. I have little reason to doubt the quality of this power supply but don't feel I can endorse it fully."
4,"Huge book, and I couldn't put it down!!!","Wow! This is a fantastic series of stories about the 3 Tyler siblings. And this is the thrid story in the series.Sage Tyler is a spoiled brat and I didn't think I would like this story because she really got on my nerves as the bratty kid sister in the first two. However, she did a lot of growing up and was much better in her own story. Harlan was too sexy! Sandra did a great job with all the leading men in this trilogy. I had my own private love affairs with Lucky, Chase and Harlan!Each one of these stories lead into the next and the journey is phenominal!This is a fantastic trilogy and I am not usually a ""re-reader"", but I am keeping this one to read again!"
4,TYPICAL ROMANCE STORY,"WELL THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL ROMANCE STORY. BOY MEETS GIRL, GIRL HATES BOY BUT SECRETLY WANTS HIM, BOY AND GIRL HAVE SEX, GIRL STILL THINKS SHE HATES THE BOY, AFTER GIRLS GROWS OUT OF STUBBORN PHASE ENDS UP WITH THE BOY. VERY CUTE! I REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK. SAGE DEFINITELY MET HER MATCH. HARLAN WAS EVERY GIRLS FANTASY, A BEAUTIFUL COWBOY! IF YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYDAY ROUTINE GIVE THIS BOOK A TRY."
3,Not as good as the first 2 but it was o.k....,Sage is book #3 in this 3 books series. Book #1 is Lucky & Book #2 is Chase.I have to agree with another reviewer who stated that the charm had worn off by this book. I really enjoyed the other 2 books & after meeting Sage in the first book I could wait to read her story but it just never really pulled me in the way I had hoped. I think part of my problem was that I thought the book was more about their business then the relationship between Sage & Harlan. I think I enjoyed seeing Chase & Lucky more than I did Sage. Those 2 crack me up & I just kept looking forward to the scenes with them.Since I still enjoyed the first 2 so well I would have to say that as a package I recommend this 3 book series.
3,Just Fair,I did not like the character of this book. She reminded me of a spoiled brat with bully brothers. Considering her education she didn't seem to be very smart. I really did not care for this book very much and was glad to have finished it so I could read something more interesting and entertaining. This was not one of Sandra Brown's better novels.
5,"""Yummy Harlan""","Tall,Dark and Yummy! <(Harlan) I think Sage and Harlan are Great together Once they Got thru frustrations lol.....I liked the Story A lot! read it all in one day I ENJOYED the Trilogy Very Much....there was one thing that Surprized me in the Story I'm Not Gonna Spoil it...Great quick read!!"
5,Wonderful! that's it !!,i have read this story more than once it's great and sage and harlan. they were great and both were stubborn but couldn't hold them selives thank u Sandra a lot KEEP ON !!
2,"Small and light, but died after 18 months with very little travel","I purchased this in Dec 2010 and it just died in May 2012 while on a business trip. This one traveled about once per month. It seems well constructed and I did not have any fraying others mentioned in their reviews. It is smaller and lighter than the 90 watt unit that came with my X200.I'm stuck deciding if I should buy another one and probably will not? $20 for 18 months isn't bad, but my eco-friendly gene is against the disposable mindset. Also, it was a huge hassle having it fail when I was out of town on business."
1,Didn't last a year!,Very disapointed in this product. Crapped out in less than a year of use. Apparently very poor quality.really how does a power supply quit this soon?Lenovo 65W Ultraport AC Adapter
2,the second one failed again,"The first product the company delivered failed in two weeks. I argued it and got a good response. The company delivered the second one. But, unfortunately, the second one failed again. I don't know why."
1,Defective from get-go,"Pay attention to this and other users who had problems. My power cord didn't work right out of the box. Yes, it can be returned, but is that why we make purchases?? I wish I had paid attention to the other reviewers who had similar experience. Here is your warning!!"
1,Not durable,The item broken in one month. It is not well attached to my laptop and my laptop can not be charged by it.
1,defective,"I bought this AC adaptor in April. In the beginning it worked quite well. But it stopped working in July. Replacing a new power cord only helped it last one more month, and now it is definitely broken."
4,Works Well,"This charger is a little different than the one that comes with the ThinkPad Edge 15. On this one, the little velcro wrap thing broke only after about two or three weeks of use. Also, my computer thinks that the power from the charger is being interrupted often. So, either there is a fault somewhere, or the charger is giving the computer a weird voltage/wattage/amperage (which I think is the problem).I ordered mine from ""SF.ALLRETIRE"", and I don't think it came in the original factory packing."
4,Works Great but Cord Thinner than Expected,"I got this because I needed another AC adapter and thought this would be the same as the one I got with my laptop. However, the cord that plugs into the wall is much flimsier than the one I already have and I am therefore nervous it's going to rip at some time in the future. I have to be much more careful with it but otherwise it was a good buy."
3,Lasted exactly one year,I bought this AC adapter exactly one year ago and it stopped working last week. I don't know how to get Lenovo's manufacter warranty on this one.
3,Lasted slightly less than a year,"Bought around Dec 25, 2009. Worked well as long as it lasted but it lasted only 9 months and that's why a 3-star rating."
4,Ok replacement,"Bought this for my Inspiron 1521 and and it works, only improvement is I wish it fit a little tighter into the back of the laptop as it is easily unplugged."
3,"Works, but immediately frayed","The thick part of the cord immediately frayed near the plug and the adapter. My old cord that came with my Lenovo tablet lasted 3 years until it frayed near the plug into the tablet... It would be great if I could interchange the parts to make a perfect power cord, however my old one has two prongs and this one has three. This one only lasted about 2 weeks before it frayed. I read the other reviews and thought maybe the fraying wouldn't happen to me! I would recommend going with the more pricey Lenovo AC adapter from the Lenovo website."
5,Travel charger,"How do you rate a batterey charger? It arrived ahead of time, it is exactly as advertised.It works perfectly. It stays in my travel bag."
4,Speedy receipt & improved cord,"We purchased a similar Lenovo-labled adaptor a year ago (different Amazon supplier)and it just failed. Actually, not the electronic components, but the cord between the wall and adaptor shorted out with a little snap & smoke. With standard shipping, received this replacement adaptor within 3 days from ""Star Adaptor Depot"" and the cord is much more sturdy 3-wire molded unit. We're optomistic."
3,"Good charger, bad power cord",The actual charger works fine. The cord that plugs the actual unit into the wall frayed and sparked in the middle of my class. After I replaced the cord with a new one everything was ok. This happened in the first week of use.
5,Lenovo 65w Ultraport adapter,"It's hard to give a ""work-a-day"" product a score, but here goes. It's a power adapter. I bought it and plugged it in and it worked exactly as advertised. So -- 5 of 5 stars."
1,Cheap knockoffs? Counterfeit?,"I don't think these are genuine Lenovo products.First of all, these are only rated for 3 amps, and the Lenovo product is rated at 7 amps in the US. Maybe this is why they get DANGEROUSLY hot. Other reviewers noted this as well. I actually smelled my carpet burning under one of these, which is how I learned how hot they get. I unplugged this adapter and plugged in the the REAL Lenovo adapter that came with my machine during the same usage and it was barely warm.I don't know if these are counterfeit, but I do know that I threw mine away and wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I think they are actually dangerous to use due to the overheating issue and the low Amperage rating. I knew the price had to be too good to be true, and it is."
1,Avoid this item like a Plague !!!!,"I bought this item in December 2010. It is the second time I order the item from the same company.The first one died within a month. Amazon were nice enough to help me to resolve the issue and give me a refund.I thought that I might be the lucky one and get the bad batch on the first order; thus, I decide to give it another chance.I order the 2nd one, and now it died within 2 months. I'm not an abusive owner nor I use it all the time. As of matter of fact, I can count with one hand on how many times have I use it within these 2 months.This time around, I got a NASTY surprise from the charger. Not only it died, but it also took my tablet with it to the bucket. I can smell the burning odor from the charger and my tablet lost its light forever.So do yourself a favor, if you must order the charger, get the charger from Lenovo itself. At least Lenovo will try to stand behind their product or accessories."
1,Lenovo Laptop adaptor Stopped working in 2 months,I have bought Lenovo laptop adaptor from Amazon but just after 2 months it stopped working. Very poor quality product and I would not recommend this to buy from Amazon.
1,Hissing,I received the AC Adapter and after the first night it started to emit a strange hissing noise that does not sound too assuring. I'm currently looking into the matter now but I'm concerned that my AC adapter will explode and burn my house down.
1,Two days' life time for me,"It's so sad that this charger only worked for me for two days after I got it. I had to return it back to Amazon and probably I will order another similar one since it's actually much cheaper than buying one from lenovo. Good luck, guys!"
1,Stopped working after a few months. I think mine was counterfeit,"It looks like the adaptor that came with my thinkpad, but you will see that the quality of the cord is lower- it is brittle and will start to crack over time, worse still, mine completely stopped working after just a few months. Complete junk. I am getting fed up with counterfeit products being sold on Amazon. Buyer beware"
1,not happy.,The picture lies. I got the absolute wrong charger. In the picture you can see that the charger part is yellow and round. The one I received was brown and a weird shape. I was very displeased that the wrong charger was sent to me.
1,Makes Weird noise and does not charge laptop. It is JUNK product,"This AC ADAPTER is a piece of JUNK. It simply does not work. It started making weird noise and have not charged my laptop. I am returning this immediately.Thanks,Gopal S"
1,Broken in less than 2 months,"I got this on March 3rd, and it went broken just today April 22. There were no external shock or something at all. It was all of the sudden that it went dead. Do I have to buy another one paying $30 after only less than 2 months? I want to have it ASed if possible."
1,"Within 45 days of use, the adpter start giving problem. From outside, it doesn't have any issue, but there is no power supply","Within 45 days of use, the adapter start giving problem. From outside, it doesn't have any issue, but there is no power supply. The adapter is waste of money, but I don't have any option I have to go for one more."
1,"Great seller, shoddy product","The seller's speed and reliability are not in question; it came on time and in pristine condition. I purchased this charger on Feb 26, 2010. However, just under three months later, it's emitting sparks and smoke -- having shorted out, it's completely unusable. It might just be mine that's defective, but I can't use my laptop without a charger. Again, no problems with the seller, but the product receives one star for incredibly bad quality."
1,FIRE HAZARD,This thing MELTED on the first use and nearly caused our sales rep's house to burn down! This is a dangerous product and should not be used by anyone.
1,Didn't work correctly from the start,"When I took this product out of the box initially I was very pleased. Its appearance matched my original product from Lenovo exactly and I was convinced the quality would be the same. However, I immediately noticed that the battery back would heat up excessively when it was in use. It was almost hot enough to burn when you touched it. I decided to keep the original packaging and return the item, but since my laptop was functioning correctly I didn't rush to do so. (My mistake!) Yesterday when I turned on the laptop there was a loud ""POP!"" from the adapter and my laptop immediately switched to battery power since the adapter was dead. The return period (which I admit I should have taken advantage of) has now expired. This review is to save you from making the same mistake I did. I would not recommend this product unless you will be happy only using it for a few months."
1,Low quality charger,The charger worked for 6 month then stopped charging without warning. I bought it because it was an OEM brand charger but the quality is just as bad as the generics.
1,charger,I had to return this product twice! both time the charger did not work. I'm still waiting for a refund... Ended up going straight to Leveno and purchasing the charge through them.
5,"Genuine Lenovo, works great!","Nothing much to add - great price for a real Genuine Lenovo charger.Fits my Lenovo R61, after my daughter hit the previous charger cable and destroyed it.."
1,Did not work,"I was so disappointed. I have ordered this product before via Amazon from a different vendor and was very pleased. However this time, when I received the adapter it would not work. I could not exchange and had to return with the option of reordering. I am hesitant to reorder."
3,"Looks the same, but skeptical...","I had to order a new charger for my ThinkPad E420s after my sweet puppy chewed through my original one. The charger I received looks exactly the same as my old one, but it gets a lot hotter. It seems to be charging my computer just fine, but I will not leave it plugged in longer than necessary, and I will only charge my computer when I'm there to keep an eye on it. The charger is uncomfortably warm to hold, and it makes me nervous. :("
2,Somewhat functional,"Delivers the requisite voltage, so it powered my T61 just fine.However, I'm assuming the wiring is much thinner than it should be. Today (8 months after purchase), the AC end of the cord shorted out when I plugged it into the wall (aka sparks, smoke, and the cord melted off).I repaired it with a soldering iron I had laying around, but when stripping the wire I noticed there wasn't much copper present underneath the insulation. If I had to guess, I'd say they pinched a few pennies by running a lighter gauge than spec.Summary: Don't buy for a high-powered ThinkPad, or you're liable to melt through the cord."
2,Two months later: already starting to break.,"I use my laptop maybe 3-4 times a week. Two months after I bought this cord as a replacement, the protective plastic around the wires has detached from the transformer box, exposing them. I will be wrapping this up with electrical tape and hope that the cord lasts me at least another 2 months or so. One thing is for sure: this cord is cheap and you need to be very VERY careful with it."
5,Worked Perfectly!,Received product on time. Product was packed well and was delivered fast! I've been using the AC adapter quite a bit for the last two weeks and it works just as the original did.
1,Lenovo 65W Ultraport AC Adapter,"The AC Adapter did not charge the battery on my Lenovo laptop. I returned the AC Adapter shortly following the purchase.The provider, SF.ALLRETIRE, contacted me directly by phone and was very apologetic that the product did not perform adequately and reimbursed me the return shipping costs. I thought the fact that they made this effort was admirable on their part since I never experienced a company take it upon themselves to contact me about a problem like this before. I give them credit for being customer friendly and for making the effort to satisfy this customer. Many cudos are extended to them."
1,Bad Product,"This product worked exactly once. I plugged it in the night I received it and it worked fine. When I tried again the next day, it didn't work and it never did again. I didn't have the time to return it, so that's my fault, but I will never purchase from this company again."
1,Lasted less than a year,"I bought this item 01/05/10. It started having problems charging a few months ago, but with some jiggling, the adapter would eventually charge my laptop. This is my back-up charger at home, I use a separate one at work. I probably would have written a review earlier if it was my main charger, and gotten a replacement one even sooner. I just bought a new one today, at 1/3 of the price on ebay and a 3 year warranty. Do not buy this charger here!"
1,Cheap AC adapter,"Do not buy from this merchant. They claim that this is the same adapter as factory, but this product and likely their other products are cheap knock offs. My first adapter worked for about one month and would always get very very hot and eventually blew out. I got my warrenty and the owner tried to extort me into giving me a 5 star rating if they honored their warranty policy. The second adapter was just they same, very hot and it would take forever to charge.Buyer Beware, Do not feed into their ""5 star"" reviews"
2,Careful about sellers,"Be careful about ordering this from a reputable seller. The adapter I got was indeed original however it wasn't exactly new or unused. The AC adapter itself is fine, spits out the current voltage and current amount of current as expected. It was however manufactured in 2009. The problem was that someone has clearly spliced a new head onto the adapter and hasn't done a very good job of it. Occasionally it will not power my laptop and it'll require some turning in the port to actually make a connection.I half expected it for the low low price I paid and it's not the end of the world as I'm only using the adapter as a spare one on my desk."
2,Not perfect,"I bought this charger as a back up to keep in my backpack for when I get stuck somewhere out and about without my original charger. Since then, the charger that came with my computer has broken and I've been using this one full time. This charger takes quite a while to charge my computer but its working pretty well until I can get a new one straight from Lenovo."
5,review of surgery,This is a great product. I found out why it was only a dollar. It is the outdated edition. Was updated in 2006. This is the 2000 edition. It was in new condition however.
4,Good Product,"I like the product, but would have liked something with a lower waistline. However, for the price, it works well."
5,This is my third one-and I'd buy another!,"I've had 2 other types of frothers, but this is convenient/reliable and affordable...Lasts about 2 years (for me - with daily use). Use low fat milk and make sure it's nice and cold."
5,Bonjour primo latte frother (rechargeable),"A dream come true! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! - great service - great product! Non better...."
1,I've Bought 3 - each one lasted 6 Months,"My wife and I use this product every morning to froth cream for our coffee. The TOTAL run time every morning is under two minutes.This is my fourth order of this product because the three previous ones lasted exactly 6 months! Now, you might be asking why I keep buying it? Answer: Convenience! It works well, extremely easy to clean, has enough power for the intended purpose, and is always ready to go. Don't worry about the rechargeable batteries failing, the bearings inside will fail far sooner and then you just throw the whole thing into the trash.I have tried five other frothers sold on Amazon, half of those have failed in the same way and the other half still work because they are seldom used. I save the working ones for use while traveling.ALL of the battery powered frothers are junk - this one is just at the top of the junk pile!"
1,It worked great until it died...11 months after I bought it,"I bought this because the manual frothers are messy and the battery operated chargers quickly slow down as the batteries wear down. I was careful to follow all the recommendations from other reviewers, including letting the battery run down before recharging. I loved the speed and creamy froths...until yesterday, when it refused to recharge. Now it seems my only option is to throw it away. If it had replaceable rechargeable batteries, I would give it 5 stars, but why make something that has to be thrown away after only a few months?????"
2,Short Lifespan,"I was very excited to find a rechargeable milk frother since I use it every morning and the battery operated ones I've had seemed to frequently need battery replacements. The BonJour frother worked great for about a year but then it stopped working. I followed the suggestion in the manual and only plugged in the charging base when the frother was losing it's get up and go. It really wasn't very frequently that it needed recharging - probably once every 6 weeks. The frother consistently worked well, however, I was really disappointed that the charging base stopped working after only being used about 10 times in that year. I guess I'll go back to the battery operated frothers since this one was more than double the price with a much shorter life."
2,expensive and does not last,expensive and does not lastworks great until it dies. 1st one lasted only 6 months. thought we had a lemon. 2nd one lasted only 4! thought maybe it was b/c we left the 1st one plugged in all the time so with the 2nd we did not (and ended up with not being able to have cappuccino now and then). The base is only a charger not a holder although that is what is portrayed. better to find one that takes 4 batteries and use rechargeable batteries - going to look now and hoping they still make one!
2,Just okay!,Out of desperation I purchased this frother when my $3.99 IKEA frother finally croaked. This one has severe attitude with the on and off switch! It is supposed to be spring loaded and turn off when you release the button. NOT! More than once I have had to clean the walls and my clothes after the goofy thing would not turn off. It frequently causes over flow onto the counter because it will not properly release the power like it should. I will get another frother when this one dies but not this one! It does have a great chage on the battery. I recharge about every 2 weeks. I use it daily. It works very well. Just a bit of a problem with the on and off switch.
1,I would not purchase again - not enough power to create froth,"This frother does not create foam. I like the idea of having a precharged, ready to go frother, but this one does not do the trick. It barely turns after being charged, or sitting in the charger. I was using the cheap Ikea battery operated frothers for years and I am going back to them, they have so much more power, and actually create foam. This frother does not create foam. I read another review similar to mine, and wished that I had purchased their battery operated one, which had a better review."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,After wearing out three battery operated frothers I decided to try a recharageable one. I read all the reviews and several were negative concerning battery life. I decided that the negative reviews might have been written by customers who had not properly followed the charging instructions.I followed the instructions exactly. I used the frother twice a day for two months and it died. Piece of crap.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had this for 3 months when it quit all together - I stil heard the motor running, but nothing happened. I'm upset that I spent so much money on this shoddy product. I switched to a manual frothing pitcher that I have been using for several weeks now, I don't expect it to break any time soon."
5,Great,"If you like frothy beverages to be quick and easy, get this rechargeable frother. It plugs in easily, charges and works on one button. It froths a cup of milk in seconds. It is reliable and environmental as my old frother also from BonJour used quite a few batteries. No more thrown away batteries AND I get frothy hot beverages in the AM."
5,Bonjour milk frother,"I find this product very useful. It can be used as a milk frother, for lattes, hot chocolate, or to make salad dressings. Another plus is that you don't have to change batteries because it comes with a battery charger."
1,Doesn't charge,"I loved this AT FIRST, but now regret it. I also have the battery operated one, and thought this would be a perfect replacement because I use it daily. Unfortunatley, after a few weeks, the charge is so weak that the frother doesn't spin strong enough to froth milk. If you are looking for a frother, get the Bonjour battery operated one, and use rechargeable batteries."
3,"Great froth, bad batteries",The up side of this product is that it makes and amazingly thick froth with very little work. The downside is that when the rechargeable batteries die there is no way to replace them. I think that is selfish of a company to expect you to buy a whole new one when all that's wrong with it is the battery. I also feel that it is ecologically irresponsible of a company to not have to option to replace the battery. So dumb!!!!
2,Does not last very long,I have had this for 5 months and this morning it died. I will go back to the ones with replaceable batteries..that one lasted a couple years before it slipped away. This worked great until its way too early death.
2,It was great until it wasn't...,"This product was great, it frothed milk and almost made whip cream. However after about a year it just died. Won't recharge at all. Big disappointment. I hate replacing batteries too but I rather do that than just have a dead frother! It was also uncomfortable in my hand - but that is just a small complaint."
1,Weak offering at best,"Power and performance was good when new but soon fell off with frequent charging required. We could have lived with this if it weren't for the out of balance condition that gradually crept into the picture. If the batteries were freshly charged, it would immediately spin up to speed and do a good job but after a few uses would slow to below the speed needed to get past the ""shakes"". Attempts to slightly tweak the shaft into a balanced condition were futile. I our estimation this is grossly overpriced for what you get. Our advice is to try another brand."
3,Fails After About a Year,"Worked great for a little under a year than died, will never spend the money on a nice one again."
1,Bought two; same result,"I bought one in 2008 that lasted a year;I bought one in March 2009, lasted only 6 months! Both times the motor gave out.Had previously bought from Bonjour several frothers with batteries (non-rechargable). They actually lasted longer. Think I would have learned!Most recently i bought an Aerolatte with non-rechargeable batteries. Pretty, but batteries don't last long...2 weeks? Cost was c. $30."
4,It works!,"Light weight, easy to use. I do wish it changed light color when the charge was complete. Otherwise, a great product."
1,JUNK,Sorry that I purchased this item before reading the reviews. Unit worked great for 4 months then stop!!! Took it back and got a replacement that lasted less than 6 months!!! You would think that the factory would switch from NiCad batteries to NiMH or Lithium??? I have gone back to my Aero which works just fine and cost less!!!
5,"Perfect for coffee, lattes, cereal.",This is such a good kitchen appliance everyone should own one. It makes the best froth I've seen and you do that with low calorie nonfat milk (and other milk). So good it seems like whipped cream. It's a no-fail kitchen tool.
2,Frother - Broken in no time,Bought this item a few months ago. Use it at work with my coffee only. It doesn't work at all anymore. I did not abuse it. Very dissappointed!
1,Mal producto,"El producto tiene poca vida util, la mia tiene como un año y ya no funciona. Creia que era la bateria, y despues de cargarla varios dias, no volvio a funcionar. Teniendo el cuidado que se tuvo con ella, y no duro nada. Tengo una de dos dolares que se maneja con baterias, la compre en otro almacen, y todavia funciona. Demasiado costosa para usarla tan poquito tiempo."
5,It's powerful!,It's SUPER frother...most powerful one I've owned and I've gone through a handful as I use them every day. Worth the extra cost.
3,Works great but breaks,Quick and simple way of frothing milk for coffee in the morning... but I am on my fourth one in three years.
2,Pseudo electric frother,"I bought this frother over a year ago hoping to do something for the environment by not using AA batteries all the time. The frother worked fine to begin with, but after a few months started to show ever slower performance cycles until I had to re-charge it. Now, I know why - thanks to the reviewer who pointed out that this frother has NiCad AA 1.2 volt non replaceable batteries in it. The way this frother is marketed is really misleading. I would not have bought it had I known that it contains batteries and on top it batteries that you can't replace. I probably charged it to often, to close in time, by now something rattles on the inside like something came loose. I will go back to the traditional AA battery operated frothers until something better appears on the market."
4,"Great, but not perfect","I bought this Bonjour Frother to replace one that died after about 5 years of use. It does a fantastic job of frothing milk, but you need to follow the instructions about unplugging the unit because eventually the battery will not take sufficient charge to work if it keeps recharging after only losing a little of its charge. While waiting for the replacement, I used a little battery-charged frother that I bought from World Market for just over $2. That worked almost as well as the Bonjour Frother."
3,frother has actually been steadily updated,"BonJour Frother, Rechargeable Primo Latte with Electric BaseThe company has steadily improved this frother over the years - and they really ought to indicate the updates by a change in model number. The first ones I bought, a few years ago, were really unreliable. My wife loves the way this frother whips up milk for her coffee and each time one fails, I take it apart and see if I can figure out what went wrong. The first ones - with NiCad batteries - died after a few months of service. The model that failed early this year had Nickel-metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries, but it died because its motor failed - batteries were still OK.The one I just bought - April 2012 - has a different motor than previous models. It's higher pitch whirring sounds suggests it moves at a higher speed (and I hope it lasts for a long time - if so I will post an update to this review). I am hoping they have finally found all the service reliability problems and fixed them for good."
4,Great Game,"this is a good strategy shot em up game.Not that difficult until you get to the 2nd save point,there are a lot of puzzles and secrets in this game. Fortunately there is a battery backed save so you dont have to start over or use a password. It can be very frustrating at times so just be patient and have fun!"
4,"Solex Carburetors, Tune, Adjust, Repair, Rebuild","SOLEX CARBURETORS, Tune Adjust, Repair, Rebuild Manual from CARBOOKS, Copyright 1973. About 87 pages.

4,Fun toy for daughter and mommy,My 2 year old daughter and I had a good laughter when we played this fishing game together. It's a little bit too advanced for her but she still could have fun. The quality is not very good. One of the fishing pole was already broken. But overall it meets my expectation.
4,Hand-eye Motor Coordination Skills Development,"First of all, there is no music in this game but that doesnt make it a negative.This is a classic game - it goes a little too quickly but that's a challenge. Because of the non-adjustable speed, it was frustrating for my 3 year old. Even for adults, it took some effort to get the hang of it. Now at 5, it is easier for her. So I will recommend this for a 4 or 5 year old... I just cannot see how a 2 year old can manage the hand-eye motor coordination skills for this.So this game is fantastic in that helps develop that skill and once you get the hang of it, it can be a little obsessive. It also helps kids develop patience which is great. Lastly, since it's a game, it helps them understand the concepts of winning and losing.Highly recommend."
1,"New ""improved"" version is awful","We had the old version, shown in the first two photos, and it was great fun for our two year old. We had several broken fish and eventually it just stopped working after a small plastic piece under the switch died, so we decided to replace it. This new version has several flaws.1. Fish are smaller than the previous version and much harder to ""catch"" especially if you're 2 and using your fingers.2. The old one started slow then speed up as the game went on, this new version is on faster speed the whole time. Even I can barely catch any fish.3. It's overall smaller and less durable, it came with two fish already broken and several of the eye stickers were missing. The old fish don't fit properly in this one so we can't use those as backups.Overall it's a bust."
3,Now I know why mommy wouldn't buy me this when I was a kid,"Arrived missing a fish, another was broken. This game is loud. Be aware!!! You will get a headache! However, if you can stand the noise, it is kind of fun. My three year old likes it."
4,Old school toy but still fun,"My 3 year old thinks this toy is really fun. He likes using the ""fishing catcher"" to catch the fish and count how many he has caught. Catching the fish requires some hand/eye coordination. When turned on the toy is pretty loud but not annoying. Like other reviews have said, it is made of cheap plastic and definitely reminds me of the toys I played with growing up in the 80's and early 90's but for a toy that costs $9 I can't really complain. It's certainly not my favorite toy but my 3 year old loves it!"
4,great for teaching hand eye coordination,My 6 year old loves this toy but get little frustrated as the fishing rod is too sensitive to any hand movement making it harder for him to catch a fish. I guess having a speed control can help kids build their confidence.
4,Good fun with Let's Go Fishin,"It's good fun for my 3-yr old. It does help with the motor skills, hand-eye coordination."
1,"Fun, but not sturdy enough for little kids.","I would give this game a zero on effective construction of the game pieces, fishing poles and pond. I would give it a 4 for fun. My son enjoyed playing it, but I broke the battery cover door while placing the batteries first thing, then he broke a fish and fishing pole and we weren't even being rough...just playing the game. Needs to be sturdier. I continue to just throw out the pieces as they break. Pretty soon the game will be a ""has been"". Wouldn't recommend, purchase as a gift or replace."
4,Customer Service Call,"We have the older version of this game, but most of the fish and the poles have broken. But my 3 1/2 yo and 8 yo still love to play with it, so I thought I'd get them a new one. It came so fast - the next day! But when we opened it, even though it was sealed in plastic, it was missing the poles. I called customer service the next morning and left a message with the story. They called me back within 5 minutes, apologized, took some info from the box and are sending out poles. The boys were a little disappointed they couldn't play right away, but CS was very helpful and I would purchase from them again."
4,Great fun toy,My three year old son and his five year old friend love to go fish ... create fun game for age three to age eight
3,hmm,"Sigh, I bought this because I remember playing this game when I was younger. Unfortunately, the concept is great, but the product is poorly made."
4,Pretty Good,"This game is pretty good for my two year old. My 4 year old enjoyes playing as well. My son though (2) will play for a while with someone or even by himself. The only issues I have are there are no extra fish so if you lose one you just lose it, there is no replacement. Also the fish come apart fairly easy. You can put them back together but still a little annoying. Overall its a good activity for my son though. It helps with his hand eye coordination. I do not regret the purchase."
2,It only worked for 1 hour before breaking,"We purchased this for our 2 year old for Christmas. We had it on when he came downstairs. He played with it immediately and really enjoyed it. 20 min later - it was dead - we don't know why. Tried changing the batteries, nothing worked. We are returning it to Santa's workshop to get repaired. Perhaps just a defective one, but was disappointed and annoyed I have to deal with returning it."
4,simple but fun,"The game is simple; nothing extremely educational here, but fun for my 3 year old. Of course it's all what you make out of it. We talk about the colors, count the fish, ect. It is louder than most toys I would generally buy, but overall it's great for a rainy day!"
5,Wonderful Toy for My Three-Year Old Daughter,"I had bought many toys for my little one and this by far is the one she keeps playing non-stop the longest. Literally she sat on the floor playing with those 21 fishes for about 4 hours!I have to admit this toy is hard to play with battery running, even an adult can't really pull out many fishes without much practice. But my girl somehow managed to play with it and found lots of fun!It looks very durable. Yeah the fish eyes are easily to peel off but the fishes are made of hard plastic.The only thing I don't like is the rotating speed. There is only ONE speed and it's too fast for kids. At least they could have a slower option."
3,Okay,"I expected something different, but it is still fun. My boys haven't been as entertained with the game as I had hoped. I think it is because the fishing poles are hard to work."
1,Let's Go Fishin',Product was returned. Tried many different batteries and still would not turn on. The child I bought this for was not happy.
3,"okay, but not good quaility",The eyes of the fish are coming off and it was is not made of the best quality products. Cheaply made.
4,Adorable,"I bought this for my two year old son. Though the game says for an age higher than my son, he still has a huge ball playing and trying to catch the fishies! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the toy itself is really loud. I was letting him play with it while I cleaned the front room and I was listening to music on my laptop. I could not hear my music over the toy. The fishing lines are also very flimsy and within the first 10 minutes, he broke one. Though, with glue it won't be hard to fix. It is a cute toy and well worth the price, just don't expect it to last forever like a more pricier one would."
2,great idea but not so great toy,"My son loves almost every game there is, he is three, including boring candyland, but this game is too hard for little ones and boring for older ones.First problem: The hooks of the poles come off so one of ours fell off and now our pole is a stupid stick.Second problem: It spins too fast. My son was trying so hard to catch one and every once in awhile he would but he would just get bored.Third problem: You basically shove the stick in the mouth and flip it out cause it doesn't really latch on.Fourth problem: The eyes fall off cause they are stickers and they don't really stick at all.I really wish I would have read reviews and chose a different game. I'm so sad. It's totally boring too cause you don't do much."
3,Broke on the first day,"My ""Go Fishing"" broke on the first day - stopped spinning. I changed the battery , and nothing. Very frustrating. Now, I have to go back to the store to return. My son loved it, though. He played for hours with it. It was nice that I could play it with him too."
1,do not buy this!,"This is a cheaply made game!The plastic part that suppose to open the battery holder, doesn't open, it is broken in some way.waste of time and money!"
1,Cheap Plastic Toy,"I bought this because I remember playing this game when I was younger. Unfortunately, the concept is great, but the product is poorly made. They should have magnets on the fishing pool hooks instead of hooks that you have to angle at a particular way to catch the fish. My son is 2 and he ended up trying to drag the fish out of their holes. Also, the battery door screw doesn't screw in, so we have to tape the battery door. I should've returned it, but figured it wasn't worth the hassle for the price. Many made in China products are much better made than this one."
5,Let go fishin preschool toy,This preschool toy is a must have for preschooler developing eye hand coordination. The aim of hooking the fish is simple and easy to play. Need two players and the development of the skill ensures the chance that you can succeed. Teaches taking turns and patience and great as a play date game.
2,Difficult Game,"Although my daughter loved the playing with this toy, it is almost impossible for a child to actually catch the fish. (I could barely do it myself!) The fish are not magnetic and the only way to catch them is by snagging the fishing pole line with a tiny bead on the four front (and only) teeth of the fish. Too hard for children."
2,Cheaply made...,"Unfortunately I thought this toy would be great, but the quality was not. 5 of the fishes were missing the ""stickers"" that make up the ""eyes"", 2 of the fishes ""jaws"" fell apart...upon closer inspection it was just badly manufactured. I was looking forward to playing this as a family game with our little boy but didn't work out. Maybe it was just this set that came out cheap, I don't know!"
3,difficult to play,My 4 year old has a difficult time picking up the fish. She can do it when it is off but once it gets going she gets frustrated and walks away.
1,Red Hat Linux is an absolute ZERO!! Read info,"I tried to like it. I really did, but a person does need a degree in computer science to install any new programs. The mp3 player is disabled, no video player, and incompatibility with most online programs out there. I don't like windows but I absolutely HATE Linux Redhat 9.0. I wanted to burn a CD of my work before I switched back to Windows, but even the damn CD burning program would'nt burn the CD. All it said was no data even though I moved the data I wanted to be burn't in the appropriate box.My father would say something is PISS POOR when it was the absolute lowest quality possible. Linux Redhat is truly a piss poor product. I threw out the CDs and now I am going back to Window Millenium because at least that works and I can actually get other programs to work with it.Piss Poor garbage! Buy Windows!!!!"
2,Red Hat Linux 9.0,"This will be a one word, well maybe two word review..It Stinks!! Don't plan on getting any real work done until you can figure out how to make this thing work and recognize your entire system, you know, printer, scanner, USB port, etc. Poorly written and just not worth the effort to get it running correctly. MS Bob would be a better investment!!"
2,Lack of progress is frustrating.,"Red Hat Linux is a fast and stable operating system but don't be fooled by the by the one whole number jump from 8 to 9. Red Hat 9.0 is just Red Hat 8 with a different logout icon. How do they expect us to be impressed anymore? You would expect the leading linux distribution to take charge and improve things, but that is not the case. Multimedia support still stinks, my palm pilot, webcam, scanner, and printer don't work either. They have also chosen to leave out NTFS support in their ""New Kernel."" This product's only plus is BlueCurve user interface, but 8.0 had that. I wonder which icon they will change for their next release."
2,[bad] operating system from ...,"The install didn't detect my printer, modem and soundcard. Had to spend 2 days scavenging for drivers and patches, and delving into unix console arcana. Fun for some, but I was hoping to do some meaningful work instead.I have no doubt the OS is powerful and very flexible, but from a user standpoint it lacks a basic prerequisite: the ability to disappear and get out of the way. Hopefully in 5-10 years all the rough edges will be ironed out. In its present form is nowhere near to being a viable desktop alternative.Recommended for those who enjoy fixing their car, growing their own food, and messing around with things. For Joe User, this ain't the ticket."
4,Best for users comfortable with using the command line...,"Red Hat 9 is very user friendly in terms of the GUI. However it does not include a lot of the multimedia features of other distros (i.e. Mandrake) In order to install Flash or Real playerthe user should expect to use the command line.That being said though. There are countless websites willing to help and if you have access to Red Hat's tech support they are GREAT, friendly and very helpful.I would strongly reccommend the RED HAT Linux 9 Bible as a compliment to this distro."
1,This product is NOT supported!,Redhat 9.0 is no longer even supported by Redhat. Save your money. I'm surprised at Amazon for offering a backlevel product like this!
3,sold obsolete stuff,"I wanted a Linux product and got it. however, disappointed that it was over 6 years old and no longer supported. I've heard of clearing out old inventory but this is ridiculous."
3,Ok Album,"Great Singers , decent songs. Some are great . Others are just mediocre. I think best thing to listen to Christmas music is turn on an internet radio station that specializes in it."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was initially very excited to read this book which seemed to be the only book I could find that was supposed to be totally dedicated to the position of catching. Overall it was ""average"" but I was a little disappointed. I didn't think the writing was very good. Much of it was just un-edited quotes from the same few catchers, many of whom I really hadn't heard or known of. The Chapter ""A Day in the Life"" of Charles Johnson was very uninteresting and really didn't focus on his catching.It is hard for me to be specific. I thought it was a decent book and certainly was reasonably priced. I was just expecting more insight from the author about the position of a catcher."
3,just alittle heavy,"These shears are just alittle heavy to use. They do cut the material, would like them to be lighter to hold."
4,Uniform and well made...,I am happy with these...they perform well in a few of my pellet guns. These are uniform and made well. Of course every fire arm acts differently so you will never know unless you try them That is half the fun for me.
1,"Clever, but not even close","This editorial writer, from a business paper, thinks he's being so clever and well-mannered in slamming Churchill, but obviously either Churchill's words hit a raw nerve, or, maybe, these critics are just too moronic with their business ""ethic"" (sic) and their ""my fatherland-uber alles"" blinders to see that what Ward Churchill is talking about, harsch as it undoubtedly is, deserves serious attention. The ironyy of the situation is that Churchill, shock value aside, is way saner than these respectable gentlemen. But, of course, the corporados and their antisocial greed, product ofi an 18th century philosophy of unfettered exploitation and subjugation of human, beast and nature, will destroy this poor planet way before anyone can do much about it. And if you think the liberals are going to stop this, my recommendation is that you stop being delusional. Sad, isn't it?"
5,Wonderful read !,I've read this book and i found it extremely informative and opens up the world of cavalry. The author knows and writes very well about the sassanians. The good reviews this book has received says it all !!!I would recommend it to anyone whos truly interested in Persian cavalry !!thanks
3,"Good, but we have all read better.....","Starts with a girl who gets Perry Mason to see her appendix scar. A case of mistaken identity? Or a man who slept with two sisters and begotten two children who look like twins? All your questions get answered eventually. It fails to involve you compared to his other masterpieces, but still a better read than most of the junk available out there."
4,Reindeer ornament,"Beautiful detail, but the antlers are very fragile.I bought this for my niece for her ornament collectionand she was thrilled."
4,"an impoertant text book, compared to Ullman - fascinating!","I disagree with the former review. Pennington's description of the papal government and law is thorough and simple enough for students to comprehend. The first chapter ""Innocent and the Divine Autority of the Pope"" is an important source. Innocent III was the first pope to regard himself as vicar of Christ. He established an important tradition of political thought in which the pope's authority was catagorized into 2 types: those powers that were human and those that were divine. The author discusses Inoccent's view of the law and government along with the other popes of the era, and important canonists like Huguccio.Compared to Walter Ullman's study - ""The Growth of Papal Government in the Middle Ages"" - Pennington's is a fresh breath of air. Want people to bang their heads and jump out the window? Let them read Ullman..."
1,wtf?,"This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Here's a summary of the gameplay1: watch a musicless, speechless cut scene with comic panels about some generic bad guy2: go punch stuff3: repeatits terrible. ive played more fun games with my dangalang."
1,I smell fish man that stinks,What can I say I am not aloud to use four letter words not that I can spell very well but I'll try this game dose not feel like it was completed this thing has SO MANY BUGS it's not funny. No wonder we've never seen an aquaman move. This game is almost as bad as superman64 and that is like the wrost game of ALL TIME so this is bad man it makes a better coster than a game skip this one.
1,What is wrong with you people,"This is the worst game to ever *cough* grace *cough* *hack* a systems library of games. All you ever do is swim in a completely bland environment. Then, you engage in simple, boring, and extremely repetitive combat. The cutscenes, if you can call them that, are just comic style pictures with extremely corny dialogue. I HATE CORNY DIALOGUE. The only reason this game merits a single star is because the submarine fights, that kinda resemble something like fun, add a little variety. In a pinch, you could have more fun shooting yourself in the foot. Nuff said."
5,If you don't love this-you're deaf..or you don't know blues!,"Whether you are a guitarist, or not - you can't fail to be impressed by this CD. Otis has one again excelled himself with the aid of Debbie Davies and Anson Funderburgh, not to mention all the other fine players. Every track on this CD just exudes fine blues and r&b and I strongly recommend it to anyone. Check Otis out live too to see probably the best Blues you will ever see!"
3,contrived,"I realize that many people don't expect much from short and sweet romances, but I was disappointed with this one. It's a little late to come into the Colton series, but this is the first I've read. Although I liked Rafe okay (he's tends to be a little brooding and dramatic) and I liked Libby's professional persona (though, she's not very quick when it comes to the probability of someone wanting to hurt her because of her father), everything was too contrived for my tastes and I had trouble finishing it... oh well."
4,Wonderful photographic history of Britain's Queen Mother,"The photographs in this book are wonderful. A complete history of the life of the Queen Mother told through the pictures that appeared in The Daily Telegraph, this is a great buy."
5,She's the Queen mum she is,"This is a lavish guide to the practically indistructable mother of the British Sovereign. She was Elizabeth Bowes-Lyons to her fellow debs in 1919, she was Queen as George VI's wife, but to all of us she is just the Queen Mum, bless her; the plucky lady with the common touch, who shrugged off gunshot wounds after a quarrel about gambling debts in an East End boozer, the massive-armed matriarchal powerhouse who has no time for nonces or liberty-takers. A marvelous book."
2,Not the Book to Get If You Want to Save Your Marriage,"For the simple reason that it gives a thumbs-up to adultery. Really. As part of the separation contract that couples draw up, if one spouse wants to ""date"" others, then, without negotiation, it is contracted that s/he be allowed to do so. No wonder so many of the marriages talked about in this book end up in divorce.Save your money"
2,Not enough specific information and too many anecdotes about couples trying to survive adultery.,I bought this book based on the recommendation of another author. I was looking for guidelines about how to navigate the controlled separation. My husband has been diagnosed with ADHD recently and we wanted to separate temporarily while we work on changing behaviors. The book did not explain the contract in a detailed manner and more than half the book is stories about couples who are in crisis because of adultery. I wanted information about how controlled separation works and a step by step guide to doing it. I found the website really had all the information I needed.
2,Seemed like a soap opera,"If you already have both agreed to seperate and feel that's the best choice for your relationship, then this book gives you many creative ideas on how to successfully achieve that. However, if you are like most people who love each other on some level, it's not as easy as 1-2-3 like the book portrays. She never goes deep into the feelings and emotions of what it really takes to be apart from someone you have spent a large portion of your life with... a person who is connected to your friends, family... she never discusses really the emotional toll on the two people involved. I thought it was a step by step plan to assist people who are already emotionally seperate - not for people in the heat of conflict but still have care for each other."
5,Thank you so much for writing this book!,"My marriage has been in trouble for some time now. I have read many relationship books and I have not been able to identify with any of them. Thank you so much for writing this book! It's the first time in a year and a half that I feel I have some direction and control in my life. I bought this book one afternoon and read it from cover to cover! The guidelines for the controlled separation are the best thing I've ever heard or read about. I'm going to discuss this with my husband and ask him to read the book. I'm looking forward to trying this and I'm also so thankful that whatever happens, I will finally (hopefully!) feel comfortable that I'm making the right decision for me and my family. Thanks!! Tracee"
3,Don't waste your money,"Very confusing to read. While there are some good points made, the author refers back to CS continuously without ever fully explaining the concept or how to go about it. The book is not setup for easy reference, if you choose to read a chapter based on your own situation, you feel like there's part of the story missing and you missed an important part somewhere along the way. For people in these unfortunate marital situations, Mira Kirshenbaum's ""Too Good To Leave, Too Bad To Stay"" is a much better choice."
1,Controlled Separation--A Crock,"As my marriage failed and my mental health waxed and waned, I sought help of all sorts. I am through the dark tunnel and I can tell you what helped and what did not. This book did not help even one bit. The idea of a controlled separation is one that you yourself could come up with. It involves ""getting some space to sort things out"" and ""setting down some groundrules"" for that space.Try to save your marriage. Go to therapy. Eschew adultery, namecalling and other forms of abuse. Take care of your children. Don't buy this book."
5,Inspirational!!!,"My husband and I are having marital difficulties. I am the one who does not want to divorce and he is the one ""sitting on the fence."" He found this book and I just finished reading it. This book has inspired me and gave me hope.Amy"
5,It looks terrific!,"Just received your book, Should I Stay or Go?. It looks terrific. So many people will be helped.Rabbi Earl A. Grollman"
4,Saved My Marriage,"Two years ago my husband & I were going through a nasty, unexpected separation. I read many many books on our situation, then came across this one in the library. I have since purchased 2 copies for friends.This book gave the best, most concrete advice on determining what our next steps should be. The helpful tool provided by this book is the Separation Contract which lets each person spell out their needs. It helped me think through all of the important issues, document what was important to me, & discuss it all with my husband. (We also shared our finished contract with a trusted pastor friend for accountability purposes.)I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know what to do next & would like to at least consider doing something positive for your relationship, even if you think there is no hope for your situation."
5,Buy It Now!,"If you own a GBA and are bored with the games that you have for it then buy 'The Hobbit'. This game is relaxing and very fun! The action and adventure in this game is very intense. If you like the 'Zelda' games then you'll love 'The Hobbit' for the GBA! There are plenty of enemies to fight, puzzles to solve, and one great quest to complete in this most exciting game so what are you waiting for?! Buy it now!"
4,quite a fun little game,"The graphics and art design of the whole thing is very nice, especially for a GBA title. This game is simple but still very fun, and hard to put down. Game play is pretty straight forward, but there are still enough surprises to distinguish it from similar titles. It actually follows the story very well. This is a great game for younger kids!"
4,The Best Game Ever!,This game was awsome!There was a lot of adventure.I never have gotten bored of it and I never will.I would give it a 10 star rating. I highly recomend this item.
2,An extreme disappointment,"Snoozer... This game is alright, but it gets pretty boring and you can't save wherever you want. I got this game after seeing my friend's X Box version, and I must say, the X Box version is a billion times better. This game is ok, but it is very repetetive and it gets really old really fast having to defeat the same enemies over and over. I am stuck in the Orc cave right now as described in Tolkien's novel, which is one of the things that made this game appeal to me originally. But, it is not the game I was expecting. I did not enjoy this game very much. My reccomendation, Pokemon, because it is a lot better... The Hobbit is not the best GBA game out there, to say the least. Save your money."
1,This is not The Two Towers or Return of the King,"Despite being a prequal in the literary word to Lord of the Rings, this is not really an RPG any more than the Legend of Zelda. There is no leveling and that was the only reason I bought this game. Buyers beware!"
2,Dissapointing,"This game isn't what it seems. The only things you fight really are animals. Sure, you fight goblins in the cave where you find the ring and at the end of the game, but otherwise its all wolves spiders and plants. Yes, you fight a lot of plants. the actual fighting isn't to good either. Bilbo keeps swinging his weapon back and forth the same way, which gets REALLY boring. This game is a dissapointment to LOTR. Only get if you are truly completely bored. (In my game theres a glitch that won't let me pass the level with the elves!!)"
3,Daring crime thriller,"Victim stands firmly in the crime thriller category, but the conventions of the genre are merely the occasion for a political plea to legalize homosexuality. It is a plea passionately and effectively delivered, albeit grounded in contemporary misguided assumptions, ie. that homosexuality is a perversion that is nevertheless incurable and ought to be tolerated as a compassionate concession to a tragic inevitability.As a thriller it is interesting enough, though the characters are shallow, since their development is clearly subordinated to the socio-political message the film is trying to get across. This is compensated for by excellent production values, the style of which clearly belongs to the new wave of British realism in the mid-50s to '60s. Bogarde and Price also deliver fine performances."
1,Colossal Waste of Money,"The headrest forces your neck and head to bend forward in an uncomfortable position when you sit in an upright or a slightly reclined position. The cushion in the seat back and the seating surface is too soft to offer any support. The underside of your thighs will sink into the gelatinous cushion that cuts off your circulation, causing varicose veins in the long run. Do NOT buy this chair. You will regret it."
1,Over-Rated and Over-Priced Chair,"I bought the fully-loaded leather package and I am really not impressed with this chair. My previous chair was the Herman Miller Aeron which I love. I thought this chair would be better because it cost more...but I was wrong. My bum sweats when I sit on this chair for any length of time (my underwear gets all sweaty, not a good feeling....maybe the fabric version is better?). The arm-rest does not adjust height wise (I hate how low the arm-rest is on my chair (and it annoys me that I can't adjust it). When you lean back, you are basically lying down. I would prefer that the whole chair reclines (tilting) back instead (not just the back-rest). It just feels un-natural when you lean back. It looks great...but I think I will stick to my Herman Miller (I love the mesh seating on the Miller...it is sooo much cooler when you sit). I would not recommend the Freedom chair."
1,HumanScale Freedom Chair gave me a herniated disc,After using this chair for 6 months I started getting severe back pain and was diagnosed with a pinched nerve due to a herniated disc. I do not recommend this chair at all
1,Dont buy this chair,"I bought this chair after reading reviews of it. Don't believe them. Big mistake. It is way over priced and does not allow you to adjust it much at all. Really not worth the money. You can get a better chair at an office warehouse store for lots less, or probably on Amazon.I bought the ""gel cushioned"" version. Not very cushioned. If you spend a lot of time in front of a pc, you're not going to like this chair. Also, if you lean back even a little, you're laying down. Can't even adjust the tension to prevent the chair from leaning back so easily. 1 star for being able to sit on it.Get something else."
2,Chair is not durable,"I bought this chair through Madison Seating via an external retailer link on Amazon. Madison charged $170 to ship from New York to Toronto, and then FedEx charged another $150 for brokerage.Shipping aside, the chair is not very durable and you must use the chair with a great deal of care:- Black weave fabric has started 'piling' in under a year.- Push pins are coming loose in the adjustable arms mechanism.- When sitting down, the arms will not support your weight if you try and brace yourself.- The seat base is also very fragile; it feels just like a piece of plastic with foam and fabric stretched across. If you put too much weight on this, I believe it will break.- No way to lock the tilt mechanism.Overall, I'm disappointed with the purchase. While the concept behind the chair is unique (and it looks good), the execution is far from perfect, and the chair is really over-priced for what it is (when used daily).Hope this helps."
1,HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE,"I weigh 155 pounds and I am 5'4. I HATE SITTING In this chair. I sit for at least 30 hours per week at my job. My butt slides out when I lean back. It's very uncomfortable.. it puts un-necessary tension on my back and neck when trying to lean back because it is so spring loaded so tight it's like a sling shot!!. And when I lean back, my head gets pushed forward with my chin in my chest.As much as I sit in this chair with the so called correct posture.. I can honestly say from experience, this chair is NOT for short people. There is nooo cush for your tush. We all know that our boss bought theese chairs just to annoy us...They also start falling apart after a few months. Plastic pieces at the join't fall off. And the small metal washers that hold the pins in place eventually work themselves loose. And this is through 3 shifts so theese chairs are sat in, 24/7."
5,Elegantly simple and comfortable,"I found it more comfortable than several that we tried at my office. The simplicity is amazing, no fiddling with 4 knobs and levers. The counterweight reclining is awesome. I can recline and take a short nap no problem. Do get the headrest. As advertised it promotes moving your position without needing re-adjustment. I do wish the lumbar support moved higher, which is more comfortable in the reclining position. Personally I liked the padding rather than the cooler mesh chairs. Service is great. I did crack one handrest after putting too much weight on it repeatedly, but HumanScale sent me a new one free with one e-mail, no questions asked."
1,Stunningly slow,"I needed a 2GB flash drive for work and picked this up at a local store. I got it to the office and dropped a 2.5 MB folder into this drive, and it took about 10 minutes (!!!) to write it. That's 0.004 MB/sec, roughly 2000 times slower that the specs claim. Reading the same folder back was instantaneous. I tried other USB ports, and even a second computer (both Windows XP PCs less than a year old) and got roughly the same results (slightly slower actually). I tried a few larger files, and found that with individual large files I got a write speeds as fast as 4MB/sec. But trying to write multiple files brings this thing to a stop. Maybe mine is defective? Anyway it's useless for my application so I'm planning on returning it."
3,"If the CD continued to work, it would have been great","I really liked this clock radio. I especially enjoyed the controls on the screen. It was very intuitive. However, after about 6 months, the CD player died. It doesn't do me much good if after a short amount of time, it breaks."
1,If I could give this negative stars I would!,The display went out in the first alarm clock I bought and they replaced it. Not six months went by and the display went out again. Philips said they would replace it at a discount of only $30. I told them to keep their alarm clocks and I would keep my money. Don't bother.
2,Broken out of the box,I was hopeful when ordering this but it arrived broken. Too bad since I liked the look and features.Only a few CDs would play and it was intermittent.Could only tune the radio by going down through the stations - up button did not work.Sent it back to Amazon and they picked up shipping too. Will buy another brand through Amazon.
4,Liked everything about this model but had to return,"Sounded great, really liked the features and the small size... Unfortunately, I had to return it due to the poor reliability of the touch screen and controls. One morning I awoke to the beeping sound of the alarm and was unable to turn the thing off. A few other times I could not get the radio or the CD to function unless I unplugged it and waited a few moments. I called Philips, thinking that I was doing something wrong. The lovely lady from Philips told me to unplug the unit. Gee, who would have thought of that solution? When the unit still did not work, she told me to send to Philips for repair. No thank-you. After finding my receipt, I returned it to the store and got my money back."
2,No radio for alarm #1,Don't buy this if you want radio or a buzzer for the first alarm. You musat use a CD for alarm #1.
2,Liked it almost enough to keep,"I REALLY wanted to keep this radio. The design is clean and the touchscreen controls are ingenious and simple to use.But the sound quality was just unacceptable. There was a buzzy, fuzzy distortion that I just couldn't put up with. The cheap discount store analog mono unit it was going to replace by comparison has a much clearer tone (if somewhat less bass).If you usually play rock at medium to high levels, it actually sounds better that way, so some may like this radio more than I did. But classical at low volume sounded like someone playing a comb and tissue paper. Philips - nice try but next time go for the two dollar speakers instead of fifty cent ones."
3,Excellent Sound,"Good sound quality. Good overall designs. Large and easy to read displays. Would have earned my 5 star if it wasn't for the annoying ""gentle wake"" feature that can't be disabled or adjusted. It's definitely a design flaw."
2,Defective speakers at low volumes,"I love the basic features of the unit...touch screen is easy to use and works well, small size.Problems:*Gentle-wake isn't, really. Volume starts at 10, which is slightly loud for me, and moves to 25 in about 20 seconds. Too fast, too loud.*Speaker defect - HEAVY distortion under volume level 18. I'm not looking for super-high-quality sound from an alarm clock, but I often don't recognize songs that I know well because the speakers are vibrating so badly, especially on the left side. Has to be a defect in the unit, although other reviews lead me to believe that it was a common defect in this model.Will try another unit to see if the speakers are acceptable."
2,Gentle Wake does not exist,"The Philips web site says the start and stop volumes, are adjustable. The woman at customer support says they are not. (I wonder what other advertised features don't exist?) The default level is so loud that you will not be gently awakened unless you are a VERY heavy sleeper."
4,Others are being unrealistic!!,"Folks, you are crazy if you think this is a bad product.Hello - you are buying a cd alarm clock, not a mini hifi system.The sound is just as good as the sony cd-853v, i know i have them set up next to each other playing.The volume - those of you who say you sleep through this, you need a fog horn. Again, it gets just as loud as the sony. Again, this is not a a mini hifi system.Bang for you buck, at only $60.00 this is a steal. You can adjust the alarm volume and you can dim the unit, read your manuals!!If you want bass, get a hi fi system. the best speakers in the world only use a limited sound range, that is why there are subs. IE - a speaker that proclaims to have a whole range is only middle of the road.You people are giving others the wrong impressions here.This is $60, it is an alarm clock. Get real. It works perfect at what it is supposed to do."
5,Very Good Purchase!,I liked the T-shirt very much and presented it to my husband and Brother-in-law for father's day. Both of us have set of twins and I'm sure that makes them twice as proud as of singleton fathers!! Needless to say both were seeing flaunting their T-shirts and got some good comments too. A purchase worth the money!
5,Hidden Gem,"LA-based Casey Fallen is making some amazing music and not enough people know about it! Listen to the song ""Crayoned Face"" and tell me it would not make an incredible soundtrack to a vampire movie! Or ""Amber"".. or that Hollywood doesn't rock your socks off. His sound invites visual interpretation, the entire Orbus Pictus album is solid and Casey's voice is high, powerful and haunting. Fans of the spaces where rock meets electronica and pop meets industrial music will like this album!"
3,It might behoover one to read something else,"Jake of the title is indeed a brat as stated by a previous reviewer.I enjoyed the book because I like vacuums and because Jake isn't mine.He's a selfish and mean opportunist who sucks up the family into a vacuum cleaner and then remorselessly relishes his punishment.Jake's not a great role model for kids. If you don't want to give your kids any evil ideas, keep them away from this book.The irreverent humor in The Day Jake Vacuumed might very well appeal to older kids and adults. However, they're not the target audience."
3,Jake The Unlikely Hero,"Jake is a little boy who flat out doesn't want to help out around the house. Without candy coating, Simon James offers some unabashed mischief. Jake is naughty. Everything ends up ok and it's lots of silliness throughout."
3,A very specialised application of Bonsai,"This is a useful book for a very specialised application of bonsai landscaping. If you have every other book on bonsai, then this will complete your collection, though you may not practice what you read because of the specialised and complex application."
3,regular,Lo bueno de este libro es que muestra al lector principiante algunas tècnicas para elaborar lajas y rocas Hay muy poco de diseño y estetica Realmente esperaba mas de este libro. Lo recomiendo solamente para lectores principiantes de este bello arte.
3,Disappointing,I own the original Twenty Questions for Kids. The game is great but some of the cards in the original version are now outdated (esp. in the people category). I was hoping for more current cards but it seems like only a few have been added. This game was a disappointment. Also one of the game pieces was broken when I opened the box.
3,Reiew for Paradise Lost,"After reading this book I went to Haiti as a missionary. Girard's historical references are very helpful and there was nothing in the book that didn't ring true. This book helped prepare me intelectually for what I saw. But... The French slave masters may have left in 1804 but literally, the slavery, the whips and the depervation of the human spirit, the complete lack of respect for human life by the have's against the have not's still remains as strong as ever."
2,The anime is much better,"I watched the first four episodes of the anime and really liked what I saw, so I decided to try out the DVD game while I was waiting to be able to afford the rest of the anime.To be honest, it was a disappointment, I only got through the first two passwords before I decided to quit. Granted, I was coming to it after experiencing the anime, so it might be different for someone playing the game without having seen the anime, but to me, the pacing seemed really slow, the graphics a bit primitive, and the controls very cumbersome in comparison. The anime is well developed, with good animation and voice acting, letting the story unfold at a good pace, so if you are already familiar with it, I would not recommend this DVD, since it is just the same thing, except not as enjoyable."
3,"Beautiful Sound, Weak Strings","This chime sounded beautiful for the first year or two, but then the strings holding the tubes started to break, dropping the chimes."
4,The key reference work on concert hall design and acoustics,"Beranek is one of the grand old men of the classical music acoustical design world. This book is a wonderful reference guide to the major concert halls of the world, with pictures, technical information, floor and seating plans, and detailed information about the acoustic design. It covers America, Europe, Japan, and a few famous halls in Oceania and Latin America. In addition, there are cogent essays summarizing the state of technical thinking in the design of good-sounding halls for classical music. If you need information about the size, sound, and history of one of the major concert halls in the world, this is the book. BTW, it is a beautiful and elegantly made book, with heavy glossy paper, etc."
5,great for history addicts,"I couldn't wait to get back to this book once I had opened it. It explained the Indian Wars, Daniel Boone, and Simon Kenton as if the author was there. I am looking for more books by this author"
5,Programmers will love it.,"Boght this shirt for my 16 year old braniac son who is into programming. He understood what it said right away and chuckled. He loves it. Good quality at a decent price. Think Geek has some fun products; we'll most likely be purchasing from them again. It seems though, that shipping was a little pricey..."
3,"""Bantam Masai""...is an unbelievably cool hybrid work...","Eidschun's ""Bantam Masai,"" the last piece on this CD, is an unbelievably cool hybrid work that will be appreciated by any art rock aficionado as well as the classical music buff who digs drama in music. I have never heard music like this before and it seems to define a new and exciting genre. I give the CD an overall rating of 3 Stars, but I give ""Bantam Masai"" a solid 5."
1,Clapboard for Movie Director,"The item we receivedHollywood Movie Studio Director Clapper Clap Board Signcame missing the nut to hold the bolt into the top so we had to rig it with a wing nut that we found in our tool box. After writing on it once with a white chalk marker we discovered that the painted finish is in fact not chalk board paint but simply black paint so we now have to color over the writing with black marker each time we want to write in new information. We purchased this for my 11 year old aspiring movie maker and he is making due with it for the low cost that we paid, however I am disappointed in this purchase and should have paid attention to the reviews closer. It is not worth it to me to pay for return shipping to have these situations remedied so it is just a live and learn lesson for us. Buyers looking for a clapper board that will actually see use of its moving parts on a regular basis should opt for paying for a better quality item."
1,Junk+,"It's a piece of junk, it actually showed up broken. The wood separated from the glue on the arm. It's a prop, for use in a costume, but wasn't presented as so. Not happy, I'm just glad it was cheap."
1,Showed up broken,Very small. Showed up broken. Will return to sender ASAP. Better choices out there. Ok for kids production maybe not a chalk surface.
1,Not the size it Showed in the picture,I needed a clapboard and went on line. I looked at the picture and saw a adult hand holding the clapboard.I have a broken clapboard but I knew by the picture with the adult hand that it was the same size as the one I wanted to replace.When I got them(I ordered 2) it was so small.It was about half the size as the one in the picture.I went back on line and ordered a bigger one from a different company that gave the dimensions.Next time I will verify the size of the product before I buy.
4,Baby crib sheets,Even though they are very hard to get on the mattress I like them because I know they will Stay on and not slide off like some have done in the past
3,What was I thinking of????,"When I was pregnant, I often wished for twins - just get it out of the way at once. Give each child a sibling.....what was I thinking of? This creepy tour through twins true crime and the irrevocable bonds of dual psychosis was not the usual real life crime book. I became increasingly uncomfortable as I read first the deed and then the personal history of the twins which led up to it. It was interesting and yet garishly tabloid-like and left me feeling even more disturbed than usual. Not for the squeamish."
3,Poor poor editing!,"Although the book is interesting, the editing in this book is horrid, which makes me wonder about the validity of this book. For example, in one story, there's a person named Shawn. However, possibly in the next sentence the author spelled the name Sean. Just little things like that. And he had quotes from people who were no longer living. If it's a book based on true crime, there shouldn't be any embellishments. It's was okay, but certainly not the best true crime book."
4,Unbelievable what twins can do to and with each other,"Well written book. It's shocking what twins can do with and to each other. Once I started reading, I could hardly put it down."
1,Beware,"This dvd (all three in the series, actually) is advertised as being in NTSC format, but it's actually a PAL disc. Just great if you own a region-free player, but Amazon is incorrectly advertising the product, so be careful when ordering. As a practitioner of Uechi Ryu, I was really looking forward to watching this. It took Amazon about a month to ship out, and after having waited so long, imagine my frustration at learning the discs won't play on my machine."
5,good,"I thought from listening to the sample audio clip that the background music might be too loud, but from listening to it in the car, it's not distracting whatsoever. The Word is easy to concentrate on and understand."
4,Excellent,I enjoy listening to this author. His voice is soothing. I laugh when he goes to each chapter. I like the case it came in and the organization of scripture. My friend ordered one because I gave it a great review.
1,Too Thin! Falsely advertised,"Although the listing says 1/4"", in actuality it is more like 1/8"". Save your money, buy elsewhere."
2,Philips AJ3460 Clock Radio,"Well, I wanted a compact, funky-styled clock/radio for my desk at work and this little guy looked like he'd fit the bill.While I do like the overall styling and color scheme of the unit, I have found the radio reception very disappointing. The sound is decent, but I only get one station. In fact, no matter where I set the dial, I can still hear that one and only station!Also, as a very minor sidenote, I would have liked it if the backlight feature was available for fulltime use as opposed to the need to press and hold a button for the feature to work.Essentially, I find that I use this clock radio for the clock, and not much else."
1,misleading product,"Despite the CD clock radio title, there is not a CD player. Don't know why its even in the product name. I will not be using this one, its going back!"
5,Nice rack :),"Fit right in the cabinet, holds a bunch of little glass jars - I was able to fit other stuff on the side too."
2,Didn't fit the Libbey spice jars,"After reading another review, I bought this to go with the 4 oz Libbey spice jars. I was so excited to set up my new spice rack but was very disappointed to realize it didn't fit. The racks were uneven and not the same width all the way across. One of the tiers fit jars all the way across while another only fit at one side. The third rack didn't fit the jars at all. Additionally, the rack was about half an inch too short to fit 4 jars.Other than that, this is a well constructed product. If It fit the jars it would definitely have earned 5 stars. Bummer!"
2,I don't know how to rate this since I feel misled...,"I gave it 2-stars since it still has function, but Amazon doesn't accurately advertise this rack. Amazon recommends that the ""Libbey 12-1/2-ounce Vibe Storage Jars, Set of 6"" go great with this rack, yet the jars don't all fit. And the few that I managed to sit on the shelves look like they might fall. In sum, I'm disappointed with this purchase. I will keep it and find another use for it, but now I have to figure out another option for storing my spices and teas."
5,A Must Have,"If you love the Bay Are Figurative movement as much as I do, this book is the definitive volume."
1,So long,Estimated ship date was 2 months away -.-...... otherwise its great! kind of flimsy but it will do the intended job!
1,Useless,This licence plate frame seems pretty useless to me because it covers the bottom of the letters and numbers of my license and that is illegal.
2,Eliminator Lighting Special Effect,Does not dance to the music like I thought it would. It rotates the same pattern over and over again no matter what music you have playing
4,Eliminator Colored Strobe Light - Criss Cross Effect (E-109),I'm very happy with this product. It's professionally designed with a built-in mic that picks up the sound and the lights move with the beat of the music. You can also adjust the speed of the lighting effects as well. I'd recommend it for any DJ or anyone looking to add some nice effects to their party. The only thing I wish it came with are some different kinds of mounting screws or even plastic tie-downs. A very good buy for your money!
1,Not for professional use!,"The description of this light leaves out one very important point. It is a 10 minutes on/10 minutes off duty light. That means that you have to keep turning it on and off every 10 minutes in order to avoid overheating. Not something that I would want to do during a show. Even if I put it on a timer, I would not want to have 10 minutes of down time of my lighting while doing a karaoke show! Now I know that you have to have an LED light to avoid this problem. I returned this one and got an LED light."
4,Good product for the price,"For the price, this product is quite good. It gives quite a nice effect and the light is fairly intense. You won't get a lot of different movement patterns and speeds from it which is expected for the price of the product. Overall I am quite satisfied. Oh yeah, one last thing, it does give out quite a bit of heat."
4,best bang for your buck...and then some,"So im a personal dj, and I did a highlighter party at a college last weekend, I have invest alot of money in lights, but i wanted a little extra. These compared to the American Dj version are about the same, except for there not LED and they arnt $60 more...but they do put on the same show. I love these lights, just remember to turn them off every 20mins for about 5 mins to let them cool off for a while.I recommend them to anybody looking to expand their lighting collection, even if your a ""baller on a budget"", these are perfect for any music occasion."
5,AWESOME,"I got this for a New Years Eve party and loved it. Added a wonderful feel to the party and responds well to the music, however there is a slight lag, but that should be expected. Gets hot on the back of where the light comes out, but burns can be easily avoided. Just don't touch it. This is a MUST HAVE for parties and looks even cooler with a fog machine. I definitely recommend this and plan to buy Eliminator products again."
5,So far so good,"I'm not a DJ or anything, I made what I call a ""Rock Band Stage Kit V2.0"" that includes this piece among others. It looks awesome in my house during a Rock Band party, especially if the fog machine is kicking. Lots of rays of light, just like the picture shows. For the price I was surprised with how great it looked."
2,Antiquated,"This item produces a pleasant effect and adds very nice lighting to the party. It has good sound sensitivity. However, the cons outweigh:1. Duty cycle 10 min means you need to buy two and also automatic timer-switches for the outlets. That triples the cost at least.2. The damned thing heats like an iron - it is not safe, if within reach, especially if kids are around.3. It is 600W - probably more power than all your house lighting together. Count in the energy cost.4. The power cord is very short (3 ft?), and there's no on/off switch. So you will likely need extension cords with a switch too - or unplug the unit every time to switch it off.5. It is bulky: this mushroom is about 18"" tall and 12"" in diameter.After some research, I've found there are many LED or laser lighting options under $100, which are under 10W power consumption, have no duty cycle requirements, won't burn you. Chauvet min lasers will even fit in your pocket. So, from my point of view, this is an antiquated product."
3,Fun!,"This light is fun! However, it gets really hot! Best not to keep it in reach or near things that could melt or catch fire. I'd unplug it, that way I didn't have to touch it. I actually burned myself the first time, not expecting the heat. It's pretty loud too, but it can be drown out by loud music."
1,not working,"I have problems when connecting the Eliminator Lighting Special Effect Series Mushroom Special Effects Lighting did not catch. open from the front and I noticed that one of the blades that power the lights this bad. Please tell me how I should proceed, if I send a new lighting? Today I am in Panama City, Panama.Awaiting your response,"
5,Traitor's Knot,"This book was excellent!! Janny Wurts is an wonderful author with a gift for creating new worlds with her words. The book shows a return to what made me love the series to begin with-believable characters that grip the imagination and a story the seems to leap off the page. Already complex characters continue to evolve while past subplots are resolved and new ones are introduced.All in all this book is a well balanced and dynamic addition to the series. I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment, Stormed Fortress. If you've read the previous books don't hesitate to read this one. If you haven't read the previous books I would suggest starting with the first book, The Curse of the Mistwraith, and working your way to this one to avoid confusion. Don't be put off by the series' length, the characters and story will capture you from beginning to end."
3,Over the top toplofty language distracts,"In my view, this has been the weakest book in the series. In previous books, I found the author's style reflected the ethos of the world. In Traitor's Gate, style exploded into nonsense. Too often sentance fragment paraded as sentance, and words mocked not only their conotations but denotations.....leaving gibberish. I have enjoyed Wurts' ability to play word games with her readers, yet in this instance the author lost the game. The verbose style, in this instance, prevented any real connections to the characters. I knew I was supposed to sympathize with Arithon--afterall I had page upon page of other characters realizing what a poor put upon guy he was---but misused words and ponderous ponderous prose left me weary of the whole mess instead of captivated.On the positive side, the plot moved forward and Wurts is truly gifted at world creation."
1,Money TOTALLY Wasted...,I would give this negative stars if I could. I do not write many reviews. A product has to be really stellar or totally bad to rate my time to comment. Sad to say this is the latter. I foolishly dumped 1/2 a bottle of tequila into this mix before tasting it. Nothing...NOTHING could make this taste good. I even tried adding sugar. An ounce of this into a previously made glass which was 3/4 full made IT even almost undrinkable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I did.
3,"Ok, but you will fool no one...","If you are a diabetic, then maybe this will suffice. If you, like me, are trying to save a few calories....it just doesn't satisfy the true Margarita craving. Definitely an artificial sweetner type taste."
4,very good,The vegan world struggles to find those treats we cannot/choose not to partake in. This is as good as it gets for a rk bar. I have learned that they are a bit dry....hence the lacking of the fifth star...but add a little soy butter on it....and it is a 5!
3,it's allright,"Im 5ft 8 1/2 and 50 inch hips.Before I put these on I have to stretch them first, then proceed to shimmy these on, one foot at a time.It's hard work.It makes me sweat like Im working out.Even after all that, they dont get all the way up in the crotch.I sing for a living and If I forget to put something else under it, to keep the pantyhose up, they start sliding down while im singing.But that's the only negative, they hold me well.They have torn at all.Im satisfied with the quality of the nylon.Oh...and these have hose toes, so dont wear them with open toe shoes.thanks"
2,Never Got to Wear These,"The legs shredded into massive runs at the slightest stretch when I was trying them on for the first time.By mistake I ordered a size that was one size too small for me which is why I'm not giving them only one star. Even so, they still shouldn't have been so fragile. I was not prepared for them to be so soft and delicate in nature.I won't order the larger size because I can't guarantee they won't behave the same way...I prefer sturdier hosiery..."
3,"Pretentious filmmaker, great band","The Good: It's ND, for chrissakes! Loads of great numbers. Everyone looks totally into it. Some cool audience silliness...The Bad and The Ugly: The filming of the main concert is an annoying joke. Much too much movement, thus no really clean/clear full shots of the band, except Barney. Personally, I would rather have the full shows of bonus features, less Arty Farty not Down and Dirty!"
3,Not so good,My two daughters (age 8 & 10) were disappointed with this product. It was difficult to work with (harder than playdough) and would stick to the molds making it difficult to remove.
3,Moon sand,My daughter likes the Moon Sand ok but says it is a little hard to work with. She was excited at first but lost interest quickly when her creations didn't look quite as perfect as she thought they should.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I bought the moon sand farm kit and 4 tubs of the different colored moon sand for my 4 year. She wanted it so bad after watching the commercials. The moon sand we received was nothing like what the commercials showed..it did not expand, it was not ""neater"" than play doh, it is messy and it's very difficult to get out of the molds. Moon Sand is basically colored sand! I wish I would have spent my money on a better product. I feel ripped off! The commercials totally misrepresented the product. My child doesn't even like playing with the sand because it's too messy. I'm going back to Play Doh!"
2,moon sand not better then pladough!,"I got this Moon Sand for my kids for Christmas and I gave it to them as an early Christmas gift. Boy was that a mistake! It was more of an heasdach then playdough has ever been. The sand was EVERYWHERE! and yes you may be able to vacume it up but we lost 1/4 of the sand in the first play. Playdough you make sure there in the kitchen so when it falls it's no big deal, you pick up the big peices droped add them back to the mix, moon sand goes everywhere and aside from the fact that it doesn't come with very much sand to begin with so of course you need to buy more which works well for the manufacture because they have a continuing customer. Once this is done I will be happy to show it the garbage and save me another headach."
1,MESSY!!!,"Moon sand is an ""outdoor only"" toy. We actually threw ours away the day we got it and the kids didn't even complain. It is just too messy. Stick with playdough."
5,Prodigious scholarship,"A cogent explanation of the beginnings and early stages of the Pacific war for both the aficionado and the general reader. The author combines a masterly command of facts with a fluid writing style. He moves with ease from analysis of the policy behind wartime decisions to the details of ship and troop movements in battle. While students of military history will appreciate the latter, the book is at its best in the conversational, almost casual, descriptions of the more mundane aspects of the routines of war. Mr. Johnson marshals his facts to tell an almost-seamless story of war and politics."
4,Good size and colour,"We had these 3 gardening tools long before we got the matching red wheelbarrow, and my daughter, who was 21 months when she first received this set, did not really play with them much until recently. With the recent purchase of the wheelbarrow, my now 25 month old help my husband and I in ""pretend"" play in our garden and enjoys it too. We play at picking up dead leaves by using one of the tools, one tool for each of us, and we swap the tools every so often and learn the names of the tools at the same time. The dead leaves are then put in the wheelbarrow for transportation to a ""destruction"" site, so we also get to learn about the trees and the flowers in the garden. All in all, very good size for small hands, lightweight but not flimsy, and very durable. The colours too, are very vivid and bright, great in the outdoors so we can always see them."
2,Not enough words!,"This dictionary is helpful, to a degree. However, it lacks quite a number of important terms. The terms in this dictionary are generally the old ones. One will not find the postmodernist vocabulary among the terms."
1,I'm done w/ Xbox!,"I'm a huge fan of the book. I enjoyed the film. But man this game sucks. It had so much potential to be great. I played it and got through maybe 4 or 5 levels and then got stuck on some stupid f-ing bridge, the DaVinci Bridge to be exact. I was there for hours and hours trying to make the dam thing connect with the other side. I exhausted all possibilities over and over again until finally giving up. I hate this! And this isn't the first Xbox game to screw up like this. I'm not asking for much here its just if you spend 40 or 50 bucks on a game you should get a playable game at least. I'm not even saying it has to be a great game or anything just f-ing work! I'm pissed and frustrated. I think I'm done with Xbox."
4,Whistlodeon,"This is great! I love it, but not as much as my African Grey parrot does. No parrot or canary owner should be without it!! (should be marketed in all the pet bird magazines!!)"
2,"Woodstock Baby Ben Chimes.. should be ""Clanky Chimes""",I have bought several Woodstock Chimes and I have to say I have not been disappointed until now! The Baby Ben Chimes are the worst that I have every heard or owned from Woodstock chimes. They are extremely clanky and loud! I don't understand this because all the chimes that I have bought from Woodstock are all precisely tuned to specific musical notes. But the Baby Ben Chimes sound like they are not tuned at all and actually they are very annoying. They are loud and over power my other chimes that sound wonderful together. Do yourself a favor and pass on these chimes and buy something else from Woodstock Chimes! I give the company five stars but this chime I can only give two stars.
1,the frame was broken,the frame was broken and i emailed the vendor with no response so i very disappointed with amazon for not screening their vendors better. thanks alotoh and it was a gift that cant be exchanged they are just stuck with a broken plate cover. Happy Birthday
2,A soporific odyssey,"Despite my great interest in Stanley Kubrick's work and personality, I couldn't finish this biography by Vincent LoBrutto. Disappointment sets in very quickly as one realizes that LoBrutto's writing style is very tedious, amateurish and repetitive. The irony is that the author is clearly an admirer of Kubrick and has done extremely meticulous research -- what a shame that the editing was not nearly as careful, quite unlike a Kubrick film.I switched to John Baxter's recently published biography and, though that book certainly has its own weaknesses, it is much more concise and has a livelier style. After finishing it, I picked up the LoBrutto book again in an attempt to at least skim it for additional detail, especially since it offers more technical information. I have again given up. The poor style is too much to endure and the extra detail is not interesting. One wonders whether the Baxter biography is merely a more professional rewrite of the LoBrutto book."
2,well researched.....,"....at times, then there is nothing, with no explanation. He is inconsistant with his info, at times failing to give simple details, like whether a particular film made $$!The first chapters are the worst, with a sea of exruciatingly detailed info about his childhood.....like countless addresses.....thrown together in a turely ham-fisted manner. And then there is little revealing detail about the making of the movies. This from a man who is a film school professor! Don't quit your day job Mr LoBrutto!"
2,"Trivia, trivia, trivia, a bit of Kubrick, and more trivia","Vincent Lobrutto's Stanley Kubrick biography is filled with meaningless bits of information, even to hardcore fans (such as myself). But as if it wasn't enough he wrote these useless anecdotes about Kubrick's young and mature life, he always exaggerated on their importance to the director's character: I don't think that young Kubrick's shouting at his friend ""Why da hell did you buy a pickle"" really has anything to do with the making of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". And the worse part is that when it finally comes to the stage where Lobrutto writes about Kubrick's films, he tells the most insignificant little stories, and not paying any attention to the artistic work. Lots of details, lack of interest. So if you really want to know the exact time when old Stan, may he rest in peace, went to the bathroom on December 16th 1976, this book is a must. Otherwise, I suggest looking in other biographies."
1,Diletantism a la Bogdanovich!,How some individuals spew and others poke causing the uninformed to almost choke on speculation and fabrication such as Lobrutto and the icon of self-delusion - Bogdanovich. Wasted tomes and altered realities.
1,Stick with the CD version,"Great acoustic arrangements of powerful AOR songs, but the presentation is boring. Even the bonus interview and slide show are boring, with nothing insightful. Stick with the CD version."
1,wrong format,"The information Amazon listed is wrong! I just received this DVD in the mail, put it in and dosn't play in my DVD player. This DVD is encoded 0 not 1 as Amazon states. Encode 1 plays in Canada and U.S. DVD players. Encoded 0 is for Europeon DVD players.Very Pissed Off!"
5,Classic Hits and More,"Daddy X is the Godfather of the underground, and the leader of the group Kottonmouth Kings, he proves on this cd that he is the godfather and whatever music the guys touch can turn to gold, just this solo cd, stoney vibrations all over on this cd, that turns more then gold, turns my nuggets into smoke, cuz thats all i wanna do when i listen to this cd"
4,Do you remember Anaheim,"I have been a fan of everything Daddy X has done for over Twenty years. He just keeps getting better. But I miss the good old days of back yard parties and tossing dounuts around at Fenders Ballroom, Songs like, Enough,10 on 1,and skate party. Daddy X has come a long way, and so have i. I look foward to whats next."
4,Sure to Confuse,"The book itself I like very much. The layout is good and its very ""readable"".Judging from all the positive reviews it seems so many have not caught-on to the ""discrepancies"" between the expression of the Catholic faith before and after Vatican II. Fortunately, throughout this book the two are grouped together. Unfortunately, the editor injects comments in the subheadings in favor of the modernist heresies and against the traditional teachings of the Church. Two churches are present here for those with ""eyes to see"". Many have not realized that their Church has apostatized from THE FAITH ONCE AND FOR ALL DELIVERED.Decide for yourself. But as for the book itself, a good book at a great price with lots of good info."
4,good purchase,"This is a nice looking tree with plenty of bright lights. It is full and easy to assemble. The only complaint is that where all the wires come together at the bottom of the tree it is hard to hide even with a large tree skirt. There was a bump sticking out of the tree skirt.I wish they had figured out a way to compact this better.Overall, I was happy with this purchase."
5,Very Convicting!,"I've borrowed this book from an Orthodox priest and he wants it back: I think I may have to buy my own copy now! Dorotheos' discorses are very convicting: every time I read another I feel full of desire to change my life! I'd advise skipping the introduction (it's about half the book) until after you've read the meat, however."
2,Monterely Flop!,"There is a defect in disk 1, it won't let you select the Master Audio format, where disk two is selectable. A lot of people in the forums are very unhappy about this, including myself.Wait until they fix this problem with a new batch of disks."
1,Watch out and avoid inetvideo!,"Due to the similarity between the covers of the 2-BDs set entitled ""The Complete Monterey Pop Festival (The Criterion Collection), 2009, ~$49, and ""Monterey Pop (The Criterion Collection), 2009, 1 BD ~$28, you will get the latter for your money.Don't try to return it for the right item! They will postpone answering you and discard your claim as being too late. Clearly, they will remain with both your money and the movie, whereas you will spend some extra $3 for returning the wrong item.I do not consider fair that Amazon is covering such lousy and faking companies by refunding you.Besides the stuff is video: ***, audio: ***, artistic impression: *****. All scores are available elsewhere in complete performance and the same quality at least (e.g., Jimi Hendrix, Otis Redding,...) and definitely at a much better price.Take care!"
3,Not at full price and still not complete,"I should have waited until the Janis Joplin-Big Brother footage was released (if it even exists). That wasn't ultimately the real downer. The real downer was that I bought this at full price at Barnes and Noble. If I had realized that I was gonna pay $80 for the 3-CD collection, I would have balked and gotten the Elvis box set instead.Yes, Monterey Pop was a fascinating even beautiful concert. A window into seeing performers in their prime. Otis, Jimi, Janis (what's little we see of her), the Who, Simon and Garfunkel, even the Mamas and the Papas were great, goof-ups and all...but still I would have gotten this 3-CD combination at a much cheaper price.My two cents."
1,Regional Codes,Since this one was regional coded for region one only (the first Blu-Ray I got from Amazon with a regional code for Region 1) it was useless to me in Australia. Amazon should mention the regional coding of the Blu-Rays they are selling so that we outside of the US will know when to buy and when not to buy!!!
1,Not received twice,I have ordered this DVD twice now and it has not arrived in my house. I am very upset about this as it was important for a book I am writing. I don't think I'll be buying anything from Amazon again
4,Good but could have been more,I loved the audience. It's a who's who of the rock world at the time. But could have had more performances.
4,"Very Good, But...","I finally broke down and bought this DVD box set. The first two DVD's are excellent, but the third disc is a real head-scratcher. It's obvious that Tiny Tim was embarrassingly bad and should not have been included. Also, I would have liked to have seen more performances by Al Kooper, Buffalo Springfield, and The Electric Flag (with the great and always wired Mike Bloomfield).On the positive side, I was surprised at just how good the Mamas and the Papas were. I've never been a big M & P fan, but their set was excellent. The Who were also outstanding. The Byrds were okay, but could have been a lot better.If you're a rock music fan/historian, you should have this box set."
5,Summer of Love...Slight Return!,"The Monterey Pop Festival was the Grandaddy of the Rock Festivals! The original film by D.A. Pennebaker crammed 3 days of music into 72 minutes. The film gave us a sample taste of what it was like, but it also made you feel cheated by it's length. The Criterion Collection of Monterey Pop fills in a lot of gaps. I enjoyed the complete performances of Jimi Hendrix & Otis Redding along with additional bonus footage of the Byrds ,The Who, and Buffalo Springfield. The film & sound quality are good enough--it's certainly not ""The Last Waltz"" as far as being a cinematic achievement! Also I found Charles Murray's commentary on the Hendrix performance to be very informative!"
2,Horrible transfer of a great concert,"A big disappointment - not the show, but the quality!! I have a copy of Monterey Pop outtakes on video from a fewyears ago as well as the original film on video, so I am comparing to these.Last night I was excited to find a copy of the box set onDVD. As I watched the outtakes DVD, I was shocked to see theHORRIBLE transfer job that was done for this set showingTONS of ugly dust and hairs all over the faces of these mostimportant people! This was NOT on the VHS copies. I cannotbelieve with all the technology they have at their fingertips,that they didn't even clean the film and telecine beforetransferring it!! How could they think of selling somethinglike this? ...!! Even the most low-brow transfer place knows to clean film and equipment before transferring.Buy the VHS if you can get it, this DVD box set is a waste of money with the very distracting dirt on most all of it."
5,Monterey Pop Review,"Very well done. Also I like the packaging, which includes a real cool little book, in addition to the 3 DVDs."
3,"Great Rental, Lousy Purchase","Great film and content, but needlessly spread out over three discs and $20-$30 too expensive. The Monterey Pop film, Otis and Jimi sets, and performance outtakes are all great, but the disc devoted to Otis and Jimi only has about an hour's worth of film which could have easily been fit on to the other two discs or could have included more content to justify the whole extra disc and price. Spreading this much material out over three discs seems like a ripoff to charge more money for an extra DVD that's more than half empty. I'd highly recommended watching these to any 60's rock fan, but I'd recommend renting now and don't buy it until it's available at a deep discount or secondhand."
4,Great Festival,"A well made preservation of great moments in popular music history. It was advertised as the complete festival, which is misleading. The complete festival was not shown. However, that which was shown was very well done.Perhaps I should have given it three stars."
3,"Good, but dated","This is a very well done book, but it is dated and a significant number of the services and URLs cited no longer exist. Some have referrals to the newer version, but many do not.We have also had trouble with the HTML writing instructions, but that is almost always a mess, so it is not a big surprise."
3,"nice start, needs to go to the next level","This is a good book that initiates what many marketers should do. It outlines the process of creating an affiliate program, but lacks some of the depth into how to go about doing it, and what should be beneath the surface of a successful program.I would suggest Make Your Website Work For You, and also Killer Content to fill in the gaps."
1,Very basic advice,"Offers nonsensical advice such as ""work hard to get a good ranking is the search engines""... and also keeps promoting the same few affiliate programs which leads me to believe the author has dealings with those companies.You can get a lot of the advice for free from various websites.Only for total novices who don't know anything about the net."
1,DOES NOT HOLD,TRIED TO FIND A HAIR SPRAY THAT HOLDS YET DOES NOT CAUSE BUILD UP. I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO SEE IF IT CAUSED BUILD UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN HOLD.
5,Picky Pups like These,"My little puppy chewer loves these bones. Also my older dog likes them. Both are small dogs, and the puppy chews through anything - even nylabones. These keep the small dogs busy for a couple of days. They don't care for a lot of other chews - turn their noses up."
4,big girls rule,"Nice story with BBW heroine, but that deals with more issues than fat discrimination. It takes a look at the perceptions all people have, weather they are the victim or the clueless villian. This is the 2nd book I've read by Allen. My only complaint is the stories then to be lean. They would really benefit from a little more flushing out of the story. Another 20% could be added without it seeming padded."
3,"Brilliant, except for the much-mentioned lack of savegame ability","Visually beautiful, awesome physics (about halfway between real world and the TV series, usually in your favor), perfect soundtrack and voice acting. Story and technology is a seamless blend of old and new series ideas, and the viper is the most fun-to-fly vehicle in any game I've played.It's worth persisting. Learn to use the 'smart' missiles; eventually you'll be turboing toward the next target long before they hit, confident that they'll find their mark.The lack of a save option is absolutely insane, especially when you're in one of those @#$% ""protect rather suicidal AI teammate"" modes, but it's the only thing wrong with the game, hence the 3 ovarall and 5 for fun."
3,Who designed this lame game???,"This game is ridiculously difficult....I couldn't do anything but roam around space and look at the pretty stars. I guess the designers pushed this thing on the market REALLY quick, in time for the SCI-FI Galactica series, so they could rake in lots of dough...Plus, I hate being able to just play the game from the cockpit view...Thank God I got this as a gift....[...] ARGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Zero playability,This is quite frankly one of the worst game purchases I've ever made. I'm sure the game designers can play this game -but unless you want to spend endless hours learning the simpliest of features skip this title. The most minimum of user testing should have exposed this title's weaknesses.
2,looks good but repetative and not enough saves,I was looking forward to this game since I was a fan of the show when it first aired. I expected a progression of difficulty as the missions progressed but it was difficult from the initial mission. Does the game have any savepoints?
2,terrible game,"This game's levels are impossible to beat without replaying them 10- 30 times each, sometimes 50 times. If you enjoy repeating and repeating the same actions until you are destroyed at the same spot on a level, this game is for you."
5,"Great game, buy it!!!","Control is excellent, game play is smooth. It's like going back in time to the 70's and being part of the TV show, but better."
1,"Sorry, I think it's awful","Paul Burns is, according to the book jacket, distinguished only by the fact he has a ""first-class degree in modern languages"" (whatever that is), and has translated many books about liberation theology.He systematically attacks all of the greatest Catholic saints, like the Cure d'Ars (an ""intransigent moralizer""), saint Joan of Arc (maybe she didn't exist!), saint Rose of Lima (she had mental problems), all missionaries (""cultural imperialists!""), etc. Cheers! (www.inquisition.ca)"
4,Remember loving it,"I remember loving this book so much when I was a young girl that I cried when it was over because I felt like Catherine was my best friend and I was going to miss reading about her life everyday. Though its not super historically accurate it is a decent introduction for younger readers to ""get-into"" the middle ages. I especially love the cover, a very clever take on a traditional looking dutch portrait. If you like a super traditional/feminine role model for your children this aint it but neither is the feminism strong enough for some, as she does eventually marry and take on more ""lady-like' qualities but I remember at the time thinking it was great that she ""got it all"" so to speak, ie got to be feminine and lady like and married but still express her individuality."
4,intriguing period conveyed by a master children's writer,"Catherine, Called Birdy is the first novel by Karen Cushman-- a now hugely popular YA novelist ( specifically in the YA genre ) who has won the Newberry. Set in the medieval time periods, Catherine is a spunky heroine who keeps an "" account"" of the goings-on in her quiet home and village . Although she is well and high-bred, her family's poverty asserts she marry wealthy. A score of suitors show up to court the young maiden and Catherine fights them all off... with pranks and pleas and costume changes ( such as mouse bones in her hair and blacking soot on her teeth ). It is Catherine's pursuit of her own happiness that makes this book so intriguing. Her perserverence and her refusal to marry anyone deemd unworthy sets her above the rest.Cushman paints the medieval period without romanticism. It is grubby and gritty and dirty and crass. We see the grease, learn of the privy and hear many of the time's exclamatory remarks."
5,I never thought funny and historical could go together!,"Catherine Called BirdyBy: Karen CushmanCatherine Called Birdy is an excellent example of what life was like in the Middle Ages for young women. Cushman draws you in to Catherine's life with her outrageous humor. I am not sure if I have ever read a book that came close to being as funny and entertaining as this one. Wait, I take that back, I am sure. What's really fascinating about this book is that what happened in Catherine's life could actually have happened to a girl in that era. So if your interested in the Middle Ages, but you don't want that old boring, regular book read Catherine Called Birdy. It will give you historical insight along with a lot of laughs."
4,Magnificent Medieval Maiden,"What a fantastic read for young adult readers! Kushman really did a terrific job in researching the middle ages and integrating it into a work of fiction. I loved the sense of humor that Catherine had and how Kushman brought out serious issue from the middle ages with humor. The fact that Catherine grows up before your very eyes is great too.Teens would love this book because they can become more grateful for the freedom that they have. Yet, they can relate to Catherine because sometimes they too feel ""caged"" by the rules and restrictions of not being treated like adults. I think that every teen should read this book."
4,The Journal of a Medieval Teenager,"Catherine tells the story of her fourteenth year in her journal. Her brother, who is studying to become a monk, has persuaded her to keep the journal as a means of helping her to grow ""less childish."" Growing up in thirteenth century England, Catherine's life seems to be predestined. Her mother's only concern is that she grow up to become a lady, while her father is engrossed in arranging her marriage to the most profitable suitor. Yet Catherine dares to dream of a different future for herself and, more than anything, wants to be able to determine her own destiny. Teens should love this glimpse of life in another time and the lighthearted tale of a feisty young teenager."
4,A fun book,"Catherine is 14 years old in 1290, England. The book is in the form of her diary. Her father is trying to marry her off to the highest bidder. Catherine does not look forward to being a wife, especially considering some of the suitors that come to visit. This book is fun to read and gives you a glimpse at ""teenage"" life in Medieval England. Sure there is some ""crass"" language, but it is nothing vulgar.I think this book would encourage readers to find out more about the Middle Ages in England."
3,"Catherine, Called Birdy","To me, this book wasn't really interesting. It's about a girl named Catherine who writes in her journal about what happened that day, who's Saints day it is and her feelings. She is really caring and thoughtful but is also pretty stubborn.Catherine seems to like writing songs and she is usually stuck inside the house to embroid and sew. On occasions, she goes places and she decides to watch things that she never watched before like hangings.She thinks her father is a mean pig because all he seems to care about is money. Soon he finds her a suitor and like you would've guessed, Catherine didn't want to marry him."
2,"Catherine, Called Birdy by Kate","I thought this book was pretty interesting overall. In the middle, there were some dry and rather boring parts, but the author nearly made up for it by her amazing character development and satisfying ending. I felt like I really got to know the main character, Catherine, as if she were a friend of mine. I liked the way that I felt like I knew everything I needed to by the end of the book. Still, it was a bit too long and drawn out for my taste. For example, I didn't need to know as much about feasting, holidays, the weather, the other villagers, monks, and fairs. To me, this was not the purpose of the book, and some of the events that occurred were unnecessary. I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't mind if the story isn't adventurous, but instead educational. This book, at least for me, was more of a story to teach me rather than to enjoy."
3,Catherine Called Birdy,"Catherine Called Birdy is a wonderful told and devolped story. This book is very good. The only problem is that Catherine is self centered, a brat, and greedy. Although her dreams are understandable she goes againist her best friend, her uncle, and she treats her ""friends"" less than dirt. If only Catherine was able to walk in other's shoe, than this book would be fantastic."
2,"Catherine, Called Birdy by Brandon","I didn't like this book very much. It was very boring at times, and the plot was pointless. For instance, at the end of the book, nothing importtant really changes. At the end of the book, I was a little annoyed that the author used such a bogus ending. I would go into more detail but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. The only things that kept me reading this book were that I had to read it for school and that it was really funny at a lot of times. It also taught me a lot about what life was like back in Medeival times. All in all, this book was barely good enough to keep me interested, but it taught me a lot and was funny, so I give it two stars. I definitely would not reccomend this book."
3,A Very Confusing Book!,"I read the book Catherine, Called Birdy and I did not understand it at all! I read it in 5th grade and it was very hard to keep up with. It is a girl's journal entries in medevil times and all the things going on in the book make it too complicated to be able to understand and put all the concepts together"
2,Catherine called boring,"This book is completely sad. It could never hold my attention, and I am not amused by 200 pages of wind in the bowels. I f there is a worse book out there e-mail me with its name. I will read it a enjoy it more!"
2,DEFINITELY not deserving of the Newberry award!!!,"This book may be historically accurate, but I found it extremely dull and pointless. The story had almost no plot and I fouund myself sometimes falling asleep while reading it. I do not think it is for 6-9th graders. It is more suited for elementary school students with her childish attitude and stupid speech. The story was overall very sappy and I don't even recommend it to the slowest of readers! This is why it received only two stars from me."
3,Sugar Goddess' Review,"The novel Catherine, Called Birdy was an OK book. By OK I mean that it could have been better. The novel is about a young girl named Catherine, or Birdy, and her life over the period of 1 year. She writes a diary, and this is a novel from day to day about what she went through. I think that this novel could have been more exciting and more action filled. The novel had some interesting parts, but most of them were pretty boring. This is truelly not an action filled novel. I would recommend this novel to readers who like the more mellow, less action,not on the edge of your seat kind of book. Besides the not action filled idea, this novel was quite creative. That is what made me want to finish the novel."
5,"Mischief, mayhem, and humor-this book has it all!","""Catherine Called Birdy"" portrays a very different version of the typical medieval woman. Catherine, the main character is headstrong, intelligent, and extremely stubborn. Her unique blend of characteristics, which are so rarely found in novels featuring women from the Middle Ages, give us unique insights into Catherine's life and beliefs. If you are looking for a welcome change from the usual medieval reads, check out this book. It is sure to amuse readers of all ages."
5,Awsome Book,"Catherine aclled Birdy can really give you an idea of what life was in the 14 and 15 hundreds. It's a great source of information. Catherine, though is erally an exception to the rule. She is not willing to go with an arranged marriage, while most girls at that time didn't really care, because they knew they really had no control over what would happen. Catherine did her best to get her suitors to dislike her, until she met the right guy. I love to just pick up this book and start anywhere, it's great for when you only have a short time to read"
5,Lady Birdy,"This book is wonderfully writen. Even my grandmother and her friend loved it. Its about this girl who lives in the Middle Ages, and what her life was like. During the book her father is trying to make her marry a man that she hates, but her intelligence is far to high and she outwits him many times.If you have read this book E-mail me with your opinion!!! This book is one of my absoulute favorites. You feel as though your right there with her."
3,the best review ever!!!!!,"I wrote this review for my 7th grade humanities class. Catherine is a twelve year old girl who lives in a medieval castle with her father, mother, and maid. She is supposed to get married to the richest man her father can find. Catherine does not want to get married, she wants to go off to be a crusader. Luckily she tricks every man her father wants her to marry - she even sets one on fire! Except one!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book written in diary style and is about the middle ages!"
4,Catherine Called Birdy,"I think that this was a good book. The main character, Catherine, is really funny and stubborn. In the story her problem is that her father is trying to make her marry someone that she does not want to marry. This story is during the Medieval Times so girls did not have a choice of who they marry. Her father found many suitors, but she found a way to get rid of them.A reader who likes comedy and suspense will like this book. There is a lot of forshadowing in this book which makes it exciting. There are a lot of characters in this story. I learned a lot about the Middle Ages from this book. A lot of the characters in this book have a big part in the book. This book is a lot of fun to read a I would recommend it."
1,Snore!,"This book was soooooooo boring. I practiclly fell asleep while reading it. It did not deserve the award it got. I can't believe there are people who liked it. All she wrote about was how many fleas she picked off and the disgusing fact that she wonders where her waste goes. I didnt even read the last few pages, but I peeked ahead. How can she marry that pig's son without even knowing what he looks like. It's like she had a total change of personality. I do not recomend this."
1,WHACK BOOK,"THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE. IF THERE WAS A SPOT FOR 0 STARS, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD GET, PROBABLY EVEN LESS. I DIDNT EVEN WASTE MY TIME READING THE WHOLE BOOK. I JUST READ THE FIRST 2 PAGES AND THE LAST 3 PAGES. I DONT RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THIS BOOK SUCKED!"
5,An Amazing Piece of Literature!,"Catherine, Called Birdy is a wondeful book for children which,I think, teaches children about caring for family members. It has got a lot of charm and humor. In this book, it is amazing how Catherines heart, mind, and personality changes from the beginning of the book to the end. Catherine is a wonderful character, as well as many other characters that will make funny remarks and will leave your child laughing. I give this book five stars because you can compare things in your life to things in the book. Once you finish this book, you will want to meet the characters that are in it. Even if you know that the characters are not real, your imagination will think differently."
5,"Outstanding Read for Eng. Lit., Historical Study, and High Interest","Catherine, Called Birdie, written by Karen Cushman provides an excellent example of historical writing describing the life of a young girl living during the Medieval Ages. It spans one year of her life yet covers her family tree and thoroughly provides insight into the many aspects of daily life at that time. It could be utilized for many age groups and reading levels. Although it is written by a girl, the life and expectations of boys during the same time period are covered in detail. I am using the book for a literary reading, a means to address the diary as a form of writing and in the area of history for the purpose to study the time span of the Middle Ages. It would be an interesting book to use for literary circles in the classroom."
4,This book is the bomb,Catherine Called Birdy was a good book. It was written by Karen cushman I thought it was very funny. Also it held my intrest And I thought it was cool because it was based on midieval times.Catherine Called Birdy is about a girl in midieval times. She is going to get married by asuitor but she doesn't want to. So she tries everything to drive them away. Her father is mean to her so they never get along.
5,My Absolute Favorite Book,"This book is my favorite! I love it! It is very funny, and it shows how someone living in the medieval times might have felt about having to marry at age 14! Birdy is so clever and sarcastic, and she makes everything sound so extavagant! It really is wonderfully descriptive and hysterical. My favorite part is when she describes her ex-suitors. She makes them sound positively horrid! And the ending is fantastic. If you do not already have the book, you should get it!"
2,Research overwhelming. Journal format overused in YA lit.,"Although Cushman has earned many awards for this title, the book itself is not that interesting. Cushman has a tendency to overwhelm the reader with all the FACT, which I'm sure she enjoyed learning, but which detracts from the story. The journal format has been overused in the young adult arena the past few years and students are turned off by it. Most of my girls gave it a PASS."
2,Too Simplistic,"The writing is overly simplistic and the story is predictable. It seems rather contrived, really, like a lot of historical fiction. The author, it seems, did a little research, found an interesting idea, and then pasted a narrative around it. I really wanted to like this book-the main character and I share a name, after all. There are so many other books out there with the same sort of plot-I might have loved this book in elementary school, but it'd definitely not intended for the ""young adult"" audience.I did enjoy some of the humor, though, especially the interaction between Catherine and her brother, the monk. The book had a lot of potential, it just doesn't quite live up to it."
2,Catherine called Birdy,I read a book called Catherine called Birdy. it was a historical novel. I thought the book was quite boring because it wasn't very easy to get into. Basically it was about a girl called Catherine who was nicknamed Birdy.It was an old fashioned book because Birdy's father was selling her to all these suitors and she didn't like or know any of them. There wasn't a very good storyline to the story and it didn't make me feel as if I couldn't put the book down. If there are any sequels I don't particularly want to read them.
2,It was alright...,"Yes, I had to read this for school. There seems to be no plot, but the book is trying to teach you how little freedom women had in the Medieval ages. Took me a while to get that. Obviously, this book is more written for girls than it is for boys. The language is not bad, but some material in the book referring to young adult themes, which is NOT appropriate for children who have to read this book."
1,AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for school and I didn't evenget through the entire thing! I must have skipped about 4 or 5 months because I thought it was so BAD! The story had no plot, was 100% pointless, and I didn't care about one character in the story. If I could rate this book lower then one star, trust me I would. If you want to read about a girls life, go buy ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"". It is a MUCH better book. The bottom line is, don't waste your money."
1,Is there any way to do less then one star?,"I hate to sound like a jerk, but in my not-so-humble opinion, THIS BOOK STANK!!!!! I found the heroine course and disgusting (what kind of person wonders where their waste goes?), and I still can't understand WHY she gave up her freedom for a BEAR. I like animals, but still!!! I found the entire book just plain DISGUSTING!!!! ::shudders:: The only reason I reccomend it to anybody is because I know that I'm not like other people, and that people my age usually ENJOY disgusting. ::shudders again, and starts praying to God:: And I thought I was crazy......"
2,As I recall...,I had to read this in 3rd or 4th grade. I recall finding it rather boring. I struggled through it. Perhaps I would enjoy it more now.
4,I really enjoyed this ... and I'm 20!,"This book is not just for preteens, it is for everyone! It is written intelligently and is so funny. Catherine is not you average damsel in distress. She is a thinker and a doer and she doesn't rely on anyone for anything. I loved the ways in which she would scare away suitors! This is a must-read for everybody."
3,Catherine Called Birdy,"I thought Catherine Called Birdy was o.k. Catherine Called Birdy is about a girl from the end of the 13th century who is trapped and miserable because her father is forcing her to get married to the richest guy of all no matter how awful or disgusting. Catherine is not very interested in lady chores like sewing,embroidering,etc, so in other words she is a tomboy. Catherine is also a rebellious teenager. This book has a very dry sence of humor. I found some of the humor funny but not all. The ways Catherine sends the suitors packing is kind of funny. My favorite part is the end because she finds her place in the world and realizes she will always be herself no matter what. Catherine does get married at the end,but that's all I'm going to say so if this sounds interesting to you and your interested in history check it out."
4,a growing-up tale,"In this delightful tale by Karen Cushman, a twelfth-century heroine matures from a rambunctious, argumentative, self-centered young mischiefmaker into a gracious, loving young lady. Despite some earthy language appropriate to the times, Birdy tells her story with all the innocence of a child who is loved and who is certain that all the world revolves around her - much like current adolescents! A wonderful read for middle scholars."
5,A hilarious look at the Middle Ages!,"I loved this book! I first read it two years ago, and have reread it many times since. It takes a light look at serious history, and gives readers a taste of life in Medieval times without depressing them with all the morbid details. However, the details were accurate, and some were presented in such a funny way. I loved it when Birdy talked about their bathing habits (going from October to May without bathing because the tub was being used to keep eels!). Birdy was such an engaging character that I go back to this book time and again to get another laugh."
5,This book is hilarious!,"If you want a good laugh, read this book. It has love, wit, and humor. Catherine is a very strong, bright, and witty character with great talent in the area of disposing of unwanted suitors. God's thumbs, this book is GREAT! I also think that this book really deserves six stars. It was written beautifully, and in a way that you could relate to."
3,A Fairly Good Book,"Although the book is a diary of Catherine's life for a year, it gets better as you continue reading. It is boring in parts of the story but is a fairly good book. Catherine's father wanted her to get married so he could get rich. He gave Catherine's hand in marriage to the highest bidding suitor who was an old guy. Catherine uses her wit and trickery to avoid all the other suitors, but the old guy was very persistent. Catherine's father wouldn't let her marry someone else although she tries to avoid him in every way. Find out what happens to her when you read the book."
4,What I Think of Catherine,"I love books set in the Middle Ages, so naturally I enjoyed this book. It is written as a diary of a teenage girl whose father is determined to marry her off well. The one thing I didn't like is how the main character Catherine, like almost every other book set in Medieval times, is mischievous, spunky, and totally unlike the average girl in the Middle Ages. But Catherine does add humor and interest to the book, while another more realistic character might seem boring. I love the ending, though, and still think it is a GREAT book."
4,A Definite Asset to Any Library,"This book is not quite as good as Midwife's Apprentice, but it's an honorable second place. This the story of Catherine, who does not want to married off for her father's greed, and is willing to do almost anything to prevent a fate of submission. 'Almost' is key.Catherine is a spirited heroine, which generated many complaints, but honestly, I don't see it as that much of a problem. If Catherine were to behave the way she does in the book, (A.K.A., running off her mouth, undermining her father, stuff like that) and her father were to let it go, then I would be going 'yeah, right.' But she get's punished for such offenses, so it's stays realistic. Also, in the end, Catherine ultimately chooses submission, and is fast on her way to maturing.Is this heavy reading? Heck, no. Should a child depend solely on this book for research? Perish the thought. It's a good place to start though, and get's the mental juices flowing. I recommend this, truly, I do."
4,Helps you remember when women and girls had no rights!,"Many people have their own opinions for everything. Catherine of "" Catherine called Birdy"" was just that type of person. This story takes place in medival times when women and girls had no say in anything. Not even who they married. Could you imagine that? Catherine can. She goes through it everyday. She gets all of her feelings out in a daily journal, which makes up the book. This book is funny and full of romance. When Catherine's Uncle George comes to visit Catherine is thrilled, because she has always had a crush on him. It is a joyful occasion until he meets Catherine's best friend Aelis. Aelis and Uncle George fall in love and Catherine wants to do anything that will stop it. She will even try spells on them to cruse love! This is a wonderful book and I strongly recomend it."
4,You ask too many questions. That's Bad Manners.,"This book is good. It's funny, and depicts what life was like in the Medivel Ages. You still need to know a little bit to start you off, and a dictionary to understand some of the old words, but other than that this book should be highly recommended"
3,Fun book for kids,"The titular Catherine (called Birdy) is a fourteen year old young lady in medieval England. Her mother is kind and softspoken, her father is a beast, one brother takes after their father and her other brother is a priest. The novel, told in journal form, starts when Birdy's brother (the priest) gives her a journal and asks her to write in it, in the hopes of helping Birdy to think, grow more introspective, and grow up a little. Then Birdy's troubles begin: her father notices she's become a young woman, and decides it's time to shop for a husband for her.Catherine, Called Birdy was one of my favorite books as a child. It chronicles not only Birdy's attempts to foil her father's plans to (basically) auction her off, but also her life in 13th century England."
4,"Cathrine, Called Birdy",At first I found this book kind of weird because of how she explained her views on life. But as i read the book I started to understand them. It was a good book that I recommend people who are studing the ways of the dark ages read. It explains what the women of those times went through. The author really captured what she intended to. This is a good book that people in all grades would enjoy reading.
3,Dull then good,I had to read this book for summer. I just hated when i had to pick up that book untill the last 60 pages.
1,Catherine Called Birdy,"This book is about a 14 year old girl named Catherine. She writes in a journal about her hard life. Her father beats her and wants to marry her off to the richest man. Her mother calls her little birdy because she has so many birds in her room.Her mother also wants her to be very polit and very girlish. One of her brothers named Edward gave her the journal to write in because he wants her to be educated. She wants to marry Perkin the goat boy and be a regular old villager. Her friend Aelis falls in love with Catherine's uncle George,but later on Aelis marrys a eight year old boy and then something happens to him. Then a man named Shaggy Beard comes to Catherine's house.Catherine thinks he is there to check her out for his son to marry,but he is really there to marry Catherine. Later on Catherine marry's someone else and has a different life. Read this book and find out who she marrys what happens to her family and how she likes marrying this man."
1,boring with absolutely no plot,"When I first started this book, I loved it. I thought it was hilarious. After a while, though, I got sick of Catherine's stupidity and immaturity and found that there was just no plot at all. I got so bored of the book I stopped in the middle, which I almost NEVER do. Normally I continue to the end of all books I read, no matter how badly written, because I just want to know what happens at the end. Not with this book! There was absolutely no suspense because there was absolutely no plot. Later, a friend of mine, as we discussed the stupidity of the book, told me what happens at the end of the nonexistant plot the back of the book suggests, and though I won't give it away here, it's as stupid as the rest of the book. I can't really say it was badly written, it was just a bad, boring book."
1,Catherine called Birdy,"One of the worst books I've ever read! The text was confusing and the plot was extremley unbearable. I could hardly tolerate it, beggining to end. Sorry Karen."
2,The Fantastic Review of the Journal,This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities classThe Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book. A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire!Rating: I rated my book 2 stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man.Who this book would be suited for: I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books.
5,Catherine Called Birdy,"This book is about a girl in Medieval times. Her father is trying to marry her off to rich men who she doesn't like, so she tries to get rid of all of them by doing real funny things"
2,Boring!!,"This book seemed like it would be interesting, but once I started to read it, it was just boring. Hoping that it would get better, I read the whole thing, but it never really did. The main character just gets really annoying by the end, with her constant complaining. Given, she sort of tries to change her situation, but not really. And she portrays her life like everyone is out to get her, even when they're trying to help her. It has a few comical moments, but not enough to redeem the book. Then at the end the ""heroine"" loses all her credibility by just seeming to give in to what she's been fighting against the whole time."
3,"Catherine, Called Birdy","Catherine, Called Birdy is a book in the form of a diary where the main character is writing. She has to do chores and act like a lady. She's always told to act lady-like by her mother or nurse. Catherine's dad tries to sell her to rich men, but she always figure out a way to get rid of them. Catherine just wants to have adventures like other villagers and people associated with royalty.What I liked about the book is how she deals with her father and him trying to sell her to rich men. She always seems to get out of being sold to rich suitors by using her wits, luck, and trickery. Sometimes you would think that when you read an entry Catherine wrote it sound like the entry continues the next day. It was exciting to find out that she will finally marry because she refused and scared away so may suitors. Sometimes some entries won't make sense but once you start reading along it starts to make sense and get interesting."
1,Wasn't all that great,I was disapointed in this book because I read it after The Midwifes Apprentice. It was boring and hard to get into. It was confusing and I didn't follow it half the time. I hope Cushman does better next time.
2,Too politically correct,Listened to the CD. There were so many references to politcally correct ideas that at first I thought the author would calm down and get to the story in a realistic manner. But she does not and continues to drivel. I did get the CD's from the library and so returned if after listening to only one CD. Perhaps it did better. But it lost me.
1,Boring,"I would never read this book if it wasn't a requirement for school. I found myself daydreaming with the book open in my hands rather than actually reading it. It was that boring. It took me a long time to get through it because I kept putting it down. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone, and if you must read it for a requirement, I feel BADDD for you. It was about a girl whose father wanted to choose her husband, and that was the only thing really happening in the book. I didn't like it. The end."
1,Catherine Called Birdy by Karen Cushman-reviewed by Jim,"I didn't like this book. I thought it was pretty bad. It was about a girl who lives in 1290 on her dad's, a lesser noble, manor. It is written in the form of a dairy with seperate entries for different days. I thought it was kind of boring because it was just a story about a girl whohas to marry who her father wants her to. She doesn't like him becuase she doesn't want to marry. She was a very revoulutionary thinker. She thought all about womans' rights, a thing which they didn't think about in that time period. Also it had a lot potty langugue. My teacher said that it was normal for back then. Even thought it made me laugh I think that he book would be better off without it. I'd recomend this book to the kind of person that likes reading diary style books and love/hate books. Over all I thoight the book stunk hence the single star. Thats just my opinion, read the book to make yours!"
1,"If I could rate this zero stars, trust me I would","I had to read this book for school, and it was boring and had absolutely no plot. It was SUPPOSED to be about a girl who's father kept trying to set her up with rich people and she was supposed to do HILARIOUS pranks to them. That happened for about 5 pages scattered throughout the book. The rest had nothing to do with anything, it was pretty much words typed up on paper. It wasn't funny. it wasn't adventurous. It wasn't anything but boring."
2,"What I Have to Say about Catherine, Called Birdy",In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off.
5,The BEST book I've ever read!,"""Catherine, Called Birdy"" is worthy for more than two thumbs up! I would tell you about it,but that would take all the fun out of it."
2,"Catherine Called, Birdy by Philip","This book was so boring that I had trouble staying awake while reading this book because it was very slow-moving and was only about the story of a girl whose father was selling her off to be married. However, I did learn a lot about what life was like for ordinary people in the Middle Ages. For instance, I learned that women were considered property and were treated as such. A father would even sell his daughter to a man who wished to marry her, sometimes against the daughter's will. Although the book was very boring, it did have a great ending with an unsuspected twist. Obviously I am not going to tell you what it was because that would take away the only good part in the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially a kid, unless you are interested in learning about life in the Middle Ages."
2,Catherine Called Birdy by Katya,"I really did not like this book. I liked the way the author wrote the book in a diary form, but that's about all I liked. There were some funny statements, like the names she gives her suitors, but overall it didn't have a very exciting plot. There wasn't very much motivation for the reader to keep reading the book. Some of the characters weren't well developed. For example, it didn't make sense why Robert was so mean to Catherine and then suddenly became nice. Athough the story was very dry, I learned a lot about the time period. For example, I leaned about the crusades, fairs, monks, nuns, villagers, rulers at that time, and religion. I definitley would not recommend this book."
2,"Catherine, Called Birdy by Jaycob","Catherine, Called Birdy was not a very good book. I didn't enjoy it at all, except for the last chapter. It was very boring and it was hard to even stay focused on the book itself. A lot of the journal entries were very ordinary, lacking excitement. However, it did give me a very good perspective on life back in Medieval Times. It gave a lot of information. For instance, it told about how girls were treated like property. They would be sold to the highest bidder, even if they didn't like him at all. I liked the ending because it gave the story a very nice twist. That was the only part of the book that I really enjoyed. I would not recoommend this book to anyone, unless they were going to read it just to find out about life back then. When they read this, they will find out that life was very dull."
3,A fairy good book,"Although it is a diary of Catherine&#65533;s life for a year, it gets better as you continue reading. It is boring in parts of the story but is a fairy good book. Catherine&#65533;s father wanted her to get married so he could get rich. He gave Catherine&#65533;s to the highest bidder. The highest bidder was an old guy. Catherine uses her wit and trickery to avoid all the other suitors, but the old guy was very persistent. Catherine&#65533;s father won&#65533;t let her marry someone else although she tries to avoid him in every way Find out what happens to her when you read the book."
1,Dull and Boring,"This is a diary of a girl who lived a long time ago and threw her spinning down the privy. It is very boring and I kept reading it, thinking something interesting would happen, but it never did. Don't waste your money on this book. You will probably never finish it."
1,HOW DID THIS GET THIS A NEWBERY?,"I seriously believe that the judges for the newberry award were drugged when they chose this book as the winner. It is pointless, stupid, and downright INTOLERABLE. Believe it. (If you don't, you can read it, and then I will garantee that you will believe it.) Trust me. This is so, so, dumb!"
1,The Big Yawnnn!,"This book I found extremely vulgar, and horrific. The diary techinque should not have been used in this book. It was very confusing to follow. If this book had not been a school assisgnment, I would have dropped it in the trash, after the first chapter. This book I found absolutly horrible, I did however enjoy The Midwife's Apprentice. I don't know what went wrong during the writing process of this book. This book was dull, boring, and vulgar, don't waste your money."
1,This Book SUCKED,"I found this book dull and boring. Catherine is a stupid main character. I hated the way it was written in the form of a diary. Who wants to hear about how many fleas Catherine picked off, and how dull it was doing embroidery. Honestly. Why would Catherine force off all of those perfectly eligible (and rich) young men. Catherine needs to get a life. She lives in some sort of sick fantasy world"
1,A young girl living in medevial times writes about her life,I did not like the book. It was too graphic on many of the subjects. The diary format of the book was hard to follow.
1,yukk it !@@$@!,"this book is one of the worst and most pathetically written book I have ever read! I've seen picture books more interesting that this piece of @$$, it ##@$%! If you think there is a more pathetic book e-mail me and I'll give you 10..00 bucks, yes, I'm that confident"
1,Catherine Called Stupid,"This is an utterly horrible book. Never in all my days have I experienced such an uttery transformingly dreadful book. I suffered through the patheticly boring diary entries, and the tacky attempts at humor were very lame; I couldn't force myself to finish. I have usually found diary narration less than entralling, but this attempt was one of the worst I have ever read. I had prepared myself for an extremely good book, since this one is often associated with books such as. Ella Enchanted, ( it is unworthy to be in the same sentence as the book.) Please, good Americans, do not waste your time on such an unspeakably dreadful narration. Ugh! Don't waste your money: b/c you are worth it! I was forced by circumstances to give it one star, but in reality, this book deserves -1,000,000,000 stars.Do not be decieved by the good reviews of this book; they are written by people who are amused by lame humor."
1,Catherine Called Birdy Book Review,I though Catherine called birdy was a very pointless stupid book! it was the worst book i have ever read in my life! i hated it! i reccomend that no one shoul read it! peace out homies!
3,Catherine Called Birdy,Catherine is a girl in England that writes a journal like every day only one a day. She is a girl who hates being a lady like girl and has to merry when she does not want to.She ends up merring someone she wants to merry. I think that this book was a little borring at first but everyday when I read it it seemed to get funnier. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because she should have merried one of the guys her father wanted her to because he was so ugly. I also think that she might have kids but she does not in my mind with the person that I think that she should have merried.
4,The unknown marriage,"This is a book in a form of a diary. The main character is writing this diary about her life. It's about a girl named Catherine who has a couple of nicknames. Her names are Catherine, Little Bird, and Birdy. Birdy's life is sad. She has to live in a men's world, because the men ruled the women. Catherine had to act like a lady, and her father was trying to find a husband for her. Catherine didn't want to get married to them so she drives them away by acting like a pig and putting mud on her face. Her last suitor was Shaggy Beard who was a pig to Catherine. She couldn't find a way out of marryng him. Is Catherine going to marry a big mean slob, or the man of her dreams? Read this book and you will find out."
3,For The Young Set,"The author came to my college a few years ago to promote this book, but I didn't get much from it that I didn't already know. I had been working full-time for years at that point (and attending college at the same time). However, the author presented this material as if it something that had never been done before. I guess it would be a revelation to the twentysomethings that it's geared towards, esp. those with little to no work experience. I don't knock most of the advice that's included in the book, however; it's needed, esp. for those who have no clue about office politics, sneaky co-workers and irritating bosses.I think that some may get the impression from profiles of people in the book that it's easy to move up in the work place quickly. Readers of the book should note that those folks are exceptions, not the norm, and many factors are involved in making a career."
5,A must have for job seekers,Jobs That Don't Suck is everything that his first book--Hot Jobs--was and more - I highly recommend it to anyone who is daunted by the idea of a job search. Buy it and read it and get a job that doesn't suck!
3,okay but buy a team losi after shock,i am 14 i got this truck for x mas and as soon as i broke in the moter with the five tanks i went to do a little jump and it landed and broke a a arm i was pissed then i sterted my team losi after shock and i was bashing that thing all day without breaking a part
5,BEST TRUCK EVER,THIS IS AN AWESOME TRUCK SOME WORDS CANT EVEN DISCRIBE HOW AMAZING IT IS BUT 1 NOTE NITROS CAN GET A LITTLE FUSEY BUT WHEN YOU GET IT FIXWD ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT AND I WOULD TAKE THIS OVER A TMAXX ANY DAY
2,2 weeks,"My first nitro rc car. I brought it because it was rated the best rc truck in year. I really wish i spent the extra cash and got the e-revo instead. It runs great when you put all your time into it. I don't have time tuning this thing ever time the weather changes. I had it for 2 weeks and i spent more time ""breaking it in"", tuning, and adjusting it than actually playing with it. I guess its a hobby in where your time trying to fix it is the actual fun part? Today i will be calling the company because the tranny seems to be stuck in neutral and i really don't want to mess with the servo or tranny that could void the warranty."
2,Beware of their iPhone app firmare update!!!,"Within minutes of unpacking and before I could even break-in the engine, the radio died and the receiver had a solid red light after TRAXXAS' iPhone app updated the firmware. I discovered that this is not an isolated case [...]. I'll contact TRAXXAS support tomorrow and see if they can fix it over the phone. If not, I'll gamble with a replacement from Amazon. Time wasted: 4 hrs, plus shipping time for original and replacement."
1,doesnt work,I was very excited to get this rooster timer but very dissapointed. Fast delivery which was great but just opened it and timer does not work. You cant even tell when it is done it just stops.
1,Dissapointed,"If possible I would have rated this as a ""0"". It did not cocka-doodle-doo or move through minuted to detect time passing by. I'm surprised it is still on selling list. Why didn't they e-mail me to send one that worked if there are any??"
5,Listening to a Dream,"With ""New Fan of the Daylight"" Tom Toth instantly creates a personal connection with the listener by weaving an incredible journey of songs that create an emotional epithany with their expression of human feelings and insights that are felt and shared by everyone. Tom writes about human loves, lifes, triumphs and shortcomings, all with compassion and understanding. While hard to choose one song as better than another, ""Listening to a Dream"" with its soaring melody and and heartfelt message, is probably the best example and easily surpasses most ""top ten hits"" out there today."
2,Too fragile for daily use!,"My first order for these glasses arrived with one broken glass. Amazon quickly sent a replacement. I was initially thrilled with them as I had been looking for insulated drinkware that was a step up from plastic. But, my enthusiasm quickly faded. After a week or so, the bottom of one glass cracked simply from being filled with ice cubes. Then, a week later, the second glass cracked in the dishwasher. They're simply too fragile for everyday use. I sent Bodum an e-mail with my comments but they never replied. Great idea, poor execution."
3,"Beautiful, but very, very, very delicate!","Just as the first reviewer indicated, these glasses are not packaged very well by the manufacturer. To make matters worse, they are made of very, very, very thin, weak glass. The larger the glass, the greater the chance it will arrive broken. I'll be giving mine away as gifts, if they last long enough."
3,"Cool concept, but not practical","I bought these glasses as a gift for someone. They really liked the concept, however, these glasses were not very practical -- ie. you cannot wash them in the dishwasher, must be hand washed, and the glass breaks very easily. The gift recipient broke 1 of the 2 glasses almost immediately.. and he was hand washing it!"
5,I love the movie and the soundtrack is even better,"I've seen this movie over 20 times and I loved it. I love the sound track too.I never thought I could ever like oldies but I do.I especially like L-O-V-E,There she goes, and Do you believe in Magic.Overall this Cd deserves an A++.=)"
4,Classy and Enjoyable,"The movie was cute, but the music was absolutely GREAT! Although some may complain about the 'missing' song, no big deal, you're still in for a treat if you buy the soundtrack. The songs are simply fun and happy, and make you want to get up and dance. The next time you are depressed, turn on the CD and let your misery wither away."
3,Good album but for one big issue; song selection,"First off, I love this movie and its music. So much so that I bought the soundtrack and will buy the score. The soundtrack includes some great and some not so great songs.I have two criticisms. 1) The most significant is the omission of ""Every time we say good bye"". This is a major song critical to the mood of leaving Napa yet the producer omitted it. WHY?!!!!2) If you expect to hear the original or popular artist for a song then think again. Most of the tunes are done by less than well known artists. Again WHY?!!!!Despite the above comments it is good album and I give it my recommendation. The producer could have made it better.Mark"
5,SUCCESS!,"When I first saw the movie i loved it.The best part though was the music.Ifound myself humming all the songs after every time I watched the it.So if you like I ,liked the movie but especially the music Iwould highly recomend this cd.It captures most of the best songs from the movie."
2,Where is it!,"Great movie, we all love it...yes yes, now on with the soundtrack's review.These songs may have been in the movie, but I cannot recall hearing very many of them. The main reason I wanted this soundtrack was for that crisp version of Glen Millers ""In the Mood,"" which played for over 5 minutes during the whole hotel fiasco in the movie. Great song that had a major part in the movie, and yet it is not on the soundtrack. Disappointment..."
5,LOVE IT!,"i got this CD last christmas because i love the movie (i have seen it 38 times and counting) and i wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is!! the best songs are ""do you believe in magic"" and ""this will be"" but the other songs are cool too."
3,OK soundtrack,"This soundtrack was OK but I found that the music didn't bring me back to the movie as well as other soundtracks. THe songs were OK, but some of the remakes failed my expectations, especially top of the world. Overall it was good and there are some good songs but doesn't deserve more than 3 stars."
3,incomplete,"this CD is in reality not a soundtrack but a compilation of a number of tunes, songs, etc. of the movie. Left out are a number of songs/tunes. For instance the classic Haydn-like tune in the scene when Hallie runs to the phonebooth. Addded are 2 tunes not present in the movie, of which there is one -groovy- having no relation with hte movie at all. Otherwise a nice CD."
5,Trapped me Listenin',I love CD! It's just as great as the movie! if u buy u gotta love trak 12 it rox!!!!!
4,Kinda Fly for a Family Moovy Soundtrack.....,".....again, I was looking for a specific jam, in this case Young/Holt Unlimited's ""Soulful Strut"", and was then directed by the kids behind the counter to this.Yeh....I was like, ""Whaaaaat?""(Like I've always said, someone around here is paying attention to these details.)But I played it in the store and liked it because it also had Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"", Nat and Natalie Cole, (separate cuts), Lovin' Spoonful. I could deal with spending my money on this to get to the jam I am looking for, you know?So, one day, I'm doing some work at home and I slip this on for some background sound. You know what? It is actually better than I thought. Especially the ""Top of the World"" redux ala some group like SmashMouth and the ""Groovin'"" remake. I can't imagine seeing the moovy, well, maybe, I will one day--but the soundtrack? It's already got my vote for pure enjoyment..."
5,Brilliant!,"The movie is definitely one of the greatest I've ever seen, and I'd definitely recommend it. The soundtrack has a lot of very good songs on it, and I believe it's well worth buying. In fact, it would be worth buying anyway if the proceeds help Disney make more great movies like this one!"
1,"""The missing track.""","No kidding. ""The"" track in my view is missing. ""Everytime we say goodbye"" was left out of this marvelous movie. I thought it made the movie. Tied it together. Really disappointing. So much so that I decided not to buy the cd."
3,Nanny 911 Season 1,Unfortuantely it is difficult for me to write a review on this as I gave it to somone needing assistance with parenting. I think however it is less of an issue with the child as it relates to the parents personal deficits so I cant comment on the effectiveness of this product.
2,portible dock w/cord,"good product, but not worth the $29 I paid. Also ordered (on same day) similiar product with out cord for $5. Once i received both, I can see by the hardware that they were manufactured by the same people. Why such a price difference just for the cord?? Will probably not buy from this seller again."
4,Nikolai is great for a 3-year-old,"I would agree that there are terminology issues with this book, however when reading to my three year old I say ""boys and girls"" instead of ""orphans."" We adopted our son in 2003 from Stavropol, Russia and it is clear to me that this author never adopted internationally. However, who cares that she doesn't have all her ""facts straight."" What matters to me is that my son understands at this point that ""Nikolai, Superman, Stuart Little, and Keaton"" were all adopted and he feels very special. He has a brown bear he sleeps with at night that we have named Nikolai. We will go into more details as he is ready. And again, it is the adult's responsibility to read the book first and ""alter"" as they feel necessary."
4,Good Book for Adopted Kids,"This book is most suitable for children who were adopted from an overseas orphanage and who are of toddler or preschool age. My only complaint is that while the author was trying to be sensitive to language about bears, the term ""orphan"" when referring to the children in the book was a little cold. I would have preferred the phrase, ""orphan children"" and that is how I read this book to my kids."
5,Versatile paint applicator,"I needed something to speed up the process of painting in areas of wood that were recessed. These bottles worked perfectly. The tip allowed me to fill in the 'floor' of the recessed area, as well as up the sides of the recessed area without any mess or overflow. Since the tip isn't cut when you received them, you can cut them so the opening is the size that you need to keep a good flow for whatever fluid you are using. Also, having six bottles allowed me to not have to constantly clean out bottles when I switched colors. I've recently purchased a couple of more sets to accomodate all of the different colors I am working with."
3,Very interesting but....,"I had never heard of Dr. Freeman before and therefore was very interested in reading about him. However, this book does go on for a while. It tends to be quite repetitive in some places and just when you think you are going to go into another phase of his life, it backtracks. It is taking me a little to get thru it but, it is interesting all the same."
3,"Okay, what REALLY happened to those patients?","I'm guessing they were more likely to end up like Rosemary Kennedy (he did her lobotomy and left her permanently and totally disabled) than Ellen Ionesco, who apparently leads a relatively normal life as she approaches her 90s. But it was the best thing medical science had to offer at the time.The stories about Dr. Freeman's personal life tended towards the dull and repetitive, possibly excepting the death of his son Keen, for which he always felt responsible and never forgave himself, and his wife's own descent into alcoholism.A far better (but definitely much harder to find!) book is Paul de Kruif's ""A Man Against Insanity"", whose concepts were as simplistic but hey, he tried."
1,Kindle version technically flawed,"Interesting book in which the author's attempt at even-handedness is appreciated. My biggest complaint was the quality of the downloaded Kindle version. In places the justification of type was spread out to a point of being a distraction. There were pages that mysteriously made my Kindle crash then reboot to the start of the book. That was maddening because you had to find a location beyond the page that triggered it to get close to where you were before. If you went back to the same location it would crash all over again. There were misspelling in places. The book was a little slow here and there. That was tolerable, but the technical glitches made my reading experience frustrating."
4,A Little Known Tragidy,"This is a fascinating look inside the mind and career of on of medicine's most controversial figures. Jack El-Hai does an excellent job not only showing you the horrible events that surround one of the most notorious medical procedures of the twentieth, but depicts a man driven by a need to greatness. That assent, and subsequent fall are what really make this book excellent. Even once you are done, it is hard to label Dr. Freeman a monster or a misguided man wanting to help the mentally ill."
3,Not a fan,"Everyone seems to really like this book. I didn't. The story itself is interesting, but the book gets too bogged down in minute details that, at times, border on boring. Also - and this is just a matter of personal taste - I found that the man in the book was so arrogant that his arrogance actually distracted me from enjoying the book. The ethical issues addressed are interesting and disturbing."
2,Not very good,"This is the first book I read from Steven Womack. I got a good beginning but finishes with a poor ending. Steven tried to mix two or three lines together in this book, which seems not a very nice arrangement."
3,Over rated,"The title is misleading. There isn't much of a war. In fact there are literally only two panels of hot kree on skrull action. But its the story that matters right? Well, the story isn't too great and the entire story feels disjointed and anti-climatic. The only real saving grace is the art. So if you still want to buy this just make sure you know what your getting. Do not come in expecting any warring between kree, skrull or avengers, or a good story for that matter."
3,"Great art, weak story","As a kid, I always recognized Neal Adams as ""that good drawer."" I was immediately drawn to the realism and dramatic flair of his artwork. He really shines in the story in which Ant-Man explores the Vision's inner workings, a la Fantastic Voyage. As good as he is, though, he's only slightly better than John Buscema. JB's work remains very underrated.Roy Thomas' storytelling...well, it's hard to be kind. It's not just that it sounds dated (the dialog is atrocious), but it doesn't seem that he had a coherent story in mind. It just meanders along.Get it if you're a fan of the Avengers and Adams and Buscema. Don't expect much from the story, though."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Avengers are caught in the middle of two warlike alien races that have been going at it a long time, the Kree, and the shapeshifting Skrulls. Captain Marvel is from the Kree race, so it was almost inevitable that he would become involved. This drags the Avengers in with him, as they realise the conflict could endanger their own planet, as well as others."
5,I need more STARS!,"Five stars is not enough to convey how much I enjoyed this film. I rented it on a whim and enjoyed it more than any of the others I rented intentionally. It is not side-splitting funny, but I had the best time visiting Mrs. Henderson's world for a couple of hours. This is a Must See Film!"
3,THE ATMOSPHERE COUNTS,To restore fully the infamous Windmill Theater and the surrounding streets it is not a little thing. Director Stephen Frears (High Fidelity) with his cast will take you there for a while and only for this experience you should see this movie.Mrs. Henderson (the very very good mrs.Judi Dench Oscar nominee) 69 old widow without any experience of the market and show biz becomes the owner of Windmill Theater. What is so important about this theater? It is presenting shows with nude girls who must remain still and by this the play overpasses the censorship restrictions and qualifies as art. She will run this special theater with manager Mr. Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins.The very good screenplay of Martin Sherman gives many opportunities to Judi Dench Bob Hoskins and the other actors.I think that this a decent charming movie in an atmospheric romantic environment that will entertain you.
5,If you like Judi Dench...,"If you like Judi Dench and anything she's done, you will like Mrs. Henderson. Altho she seems a bit starchy at the beginning of the film,you'll find yourself ready the lead cheers for her by the end."
5,Inspired from real events.....,"I loved this movie in all aspects from the acting---- Judi Dench is phenomenal in this movie and so is Bob Hoskins' performance--- to the storyline, script, settings and so on!!Recently widowed and very well-to-do, Laura Henderson, isn't content to live out the rest of her days hob-nobbing with other society ladies and partaking in the usual hobbies expected of a woman of her status...... she's way too feisty!So, Mrs. Henderson decides to buy and renovate an old and abandoned theatre and put on non-stop nude show revues. Mrs. Henderson hires theatre manager Vivian Van Damm to run her theatre and the two of them don't always see eye to eye. It is interesting to see/hear the witty dialogue between the two who obviously really love each other.Highly recommend this movie!"
5,Mrs Henderson Presents,"True Facts re London Bombingin WW2.Excellent performance as usual from Dame Judi Dench,and Hoskins.Absolutely a must for viewers born during the WAR 1939-45"
4,Delightful,"After this movie, I have every intention of watching more of Judi Dench's films. What carries this film is not the story or the musical score, but her performance. The story has been summarized above - WWII, naked girls in the theater, troop morale etc.Mrs. Henderson is full of life. She has lost a son, a husband, and she is getting on in years, but she experiences both joy and sorrow to the fullest extent and is clearly intent on maximizing the former. She is out of touch with the life of the lower classes, but she is self-aware, has a good heart and loathes restrictive social norms (which she is rich enough to defy), which makes her a very likeable character. Because of Dench's performance, the radiant Mrs. Henderson's zest for life rubs off a little on the audience, too. Highly recommended :)"
5,"Mrs, Henderson Presents","No one is more delicious than Dame Judith is this period piece. Bob Hoskins looks better than he ever has and is a wonderful foil for ""Mrs. Henderson"". It's an ADULT movie worth seeing more than once and I liked the graciousness of it. If you like great acting and strong characterisations this is the movie for you. If you like intelligent dialogue and a good story to boot, this is the movie for you. If you just want to be entertained for the evening, this is the movie for you. It's great!"
5,DVD does tremendous justice to this magnificent film,"I loved this film in the theatre and must say that the DVD Widescreen transfer with all of the extras(including the ORIGINAL Windmill girls!-and a very good commentary by the director) is a must have in your library.What a shame that this wonderfully clever and extremely well acted and directed (Stephen Frears,THE QUEEN) had such a limited release in the arthouses.The musical stage numbers are outstanding and every bit as good as any of the recent musicals since CHICAGO.This film assembles absolutely the creme dela creme of British stage,cinema(Dench and Hoskins) and even Pop star Will Young and American ""nut"" Christopher Guest, to bring to life a VERY interesting piece of theatre history in London.For the price of this DVD you simply can't go wrong!!!"
5,loved it!!,Was surprised by the story but loved every minute. Can not wait to share this with many friends with popcorn and wine!!
4,Very entertaining period piece,"I bought this movie so I could get some World War Ii song and dance ideas for my 40's era singing group that highlights the musical review numbers of the USO shows, but the movie was so good on its own, I was sorry I hadn't rented it sooner! Very entertaining!"
4,Mrs. Henderson,"Judi Dench is great and whatever movie she acts in will automatically be added to our collection. What a lineup of fine actresses the British have! Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson, and so many more."
5,Very intertaining,"Ms Dench plays a very strong widow going into the musical revue business along with Mr Hoskins...Both look for control, resulting in very funny scenes...A nice representation of the remnants of strict victorian morals....and a very good performance by Ms Dench."
5,Pure Enjoyment from Amazon,I saw this movie and had to have it. It's one of those movies I will rewatch. It is good for an evening when you need a pick me up.
1,"Boring, boring and just terrible.",There is almost nothing to say about this movie other than the establishment of The Windmill Theatre with its famous statue nudes and packed houses of servicemen in World War 2. The rest is a boring half-hearted dialogue between Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins which is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Lots of breasts and bad acting from their owners.
3,rich widow's hobby or soldiers delight?,"After her husband dies a widow searches for something to doand finds a theater that she went to with her husband closed down,being rich she buys it and hires a wise old fellow to manage it.Starting with a musical review they are initially successful,but others copy their style. she hits on the idea of female nudityand gets the ok from the Lord Chamberlainif they are like still paintings and notstrippers. This rule of government over theaters in Londongoes back to the days of Shakespeare as we see inShakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series).Women at that time weren't allowed to play womens roles.Some times one wonders after seeing the current crop of romantic comediesif we have really made progress or maybe regressed?Here the nude girls are a great hit and the Festival of Arts-Laguna Beachis an imitation of this tableaux vivants style of presentation.The result is a somewhat funny movie about real events during WWII in London."
1,I got a dud and the service center was also a dud.,I'm sure the monitor is nice. When I got it there were some issues. I called the service center for HP and of course I get someone from India. After an hour I hung up and sent the product back.
2,A Short Film Not Worth Its Price,"This film is only 34 minutes. It does not worth the price asked for it and actors' performance is pretense, not convincing at all."
5,anne of green gables,i love to share this with other people i really love the story they going to love it too as well.
4,Good explanations. No color!,"Charles is a very good teacher. Explanations are very down-to-earth, so anyone can understand the protocols. Be warned that the pictures are not in color, but his web site and PDF do show them in color. That becomes crucial for some of the more complicated diagrams. My other complaint is that it's a bit long-winded at time due to the included jokes - I think 1600 pages is enough that adding jokes is unnecessary."
4,Great reference book.,"Great reference book on the TCP / IP Stack. Intuitive writing and can even serve as a geek table book, considering it's a very approachable book."
5,"Phenomenal, time-consuming","This tome sucks from cover-to-cover.Yes, I've read all the pages.Be warned !"
4,A must have for any networking enthusiast,"This is a great book/reference for any networking enthusiast. I wanted to brush up on my networking skills with TCP/IP and after doing a lot of research for a good book, I found this wonderful book.Easy to pick up, especially if you already have knowledge with TCP/IP! Pick this book up and you won't regret it!"
4,Information Overload,I have wanted this book for a long time. Finally bought it and was pleasently surprised how deep it delves into the subject matter. This is definitely a reference book I will keep in arms reach. Sipping was quick. Book was in excellent condition.
4,Don't get the box set!,The box set robs you of precious scenes . Bye each volume individually . This is great if your a fan of jackass like me.unfortunatly it is censored so all the nudity Is blurred and all the swears are bleeped . Still fun to watch on a rainy day
3,Smaller than expected...,"I truly like this tooth brush holder... I bought it after my previous one started getting rusty. I am glad this one does not get rusty... I think it's because of the ceramic bottom rather than stainless steel... anyway, the holes for the toothbrush were a little too small for my toothbrush's, which aren't too huge to begin with. But aside from that, this is great. I will keep it and buy a new toothbrush."
5,Love It,I got one two years ago. It still likes brand new. The bottom of holder can catch dropped water. I love it.
4,Granddaughter gift,Bear was in excellent condition as described. I will be using it for a Christmas present and I know she will love it.
1,"""Lens Error""","One week out of the box, for no reason at all, the camera started giving the ""Les Error"". The camera doesn't work and the zoom won't retract."
3,Pobre rendimiento,"Excelente camara con muchas funciones, pero el rendimiento de la bateria es pesimo pienso que nikon debe buscarle una solucion a este problema por que la bateria no dura mas de una hora, despues de lo otro la camara es maravillosa"
1,Nikon coolpix s7c is a HORRIBLE choice,"I have been searching reviews of the Nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and I am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with Nikon only to be told 'sorry'.In a nutshell, I am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new SLR models. I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES.The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is. Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures."
2,Not Pleased:(,"Not a good camera. Terrible in low light. Terrible focusing in low light. Just, all in all, a bad camera. Invested so much time in the whole wireless feature, forgot to perfect the basic camera necessitities. Trust this review, have had several cameras and none have which have been near this frustrating to own. Looks are cool but thats where it stops!"
2,Not My Best Nikon,"I've always been high on Nikon products but can't stand this unit. Yes it takes fair photos and has all the flexibility anyone can expect in a camera. The bigest and most serious drawback is the inability to view anything on the screen on a bright, sunny day. On a recent trip to Italy I couldn't use it outside during the daytime. Thank God I had my Canon as back up otherwise I wouldn't have any pictures."
2,What has happend to Nikon,"What a horrible horrible horrible camera this is. The only thing that is nice about it is the looks. Like other lessons in life, looks aren't everything.Run Away!!!"
1,not worth it!,"I received this camera as a gift from my husband who had been listening to me say I wanted a smaller digital camera to capture the everyday moments of our three kids. I previously had a Canon Powershot G3 which I loved, although it was bulky and hard to carry around when I had my three small kids with me. That being said, this camera is a waste of money. While it is small and fits nicely in my purse, I have yet to get one nice photo out of it. I consistenly get blurry pictures and all the lower light shots have subject who have these bright white eyes that can not be photo shopped out. I sent it back to Nikon who ""repaired"" it for free, however the repair did nothing. I have had my pictures from several imporatant occasions ruined by this camera and am planning to trade it in for anthother Canon soon."
4,Little point,"I've bought like 3 or 4 Nikon Coolpix S7c, and i've seen the camara has a good funtion but after use for sometime appear on the screen a little point like a lens scratch, this point no is a lcd dead pixel, is a problem on the lens, no is a significative problem, but exist."
1,Terrible,"I was so disappointed in this camera that i returned it. i thought it was terrible - the picture quality is horrendous. it looked better on the actual camera than it did on my computer. the pictures are grainy; they're neither sharp nor clear. I was just vey disappointed with this camera. I wanted to update from my canon digital elph b/c i've had mechanical problems with it. the elph, though older, took much sharper, crisper pictures than this. it was just incredibly disappointing, especially when nikon is known for their cameras."
4,Nikon S7C Camera,This camera has a large screen very easy to view. We are satisfied with all the features of this camera so far. The wireless transfer function using our existing wireless network is so convenient and efficient. Just need to clean the screen often because all your finger prints are over the glass screen when you hold the camera.
2,Wifi = good. pictures = bad,"The wifi is a great idea! The idea on paper sounds amazing, but the way you had to do it was horrible. it gave you no control over what pictures or anything. plus it was slow.The Picture quality was HORRILBE!!! M y two Megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera. They look AMAZING on the LCD screen, but once you get them on the computer, they are fuzzy, grainy, etc.I would not recomend this camera to anybody. yes, it has some nice features, but the pictures are anything but acceptable."
4,Nikon Coolpix S7c,I was using a Nikon S3 until it's lens failed without warning. I chose the S7c because besides the S3 it's the only small digital with decent macro capabilities below the expensive full size SLR models. So far the S7c appears to take high quality photos on par with the S3. The only problem is that it won't interface with my Canon downloader (the S3 did). Right now I can't attach pictures taken with the Nikon and transferred using Nikon's software to emails. I'm looking for a solution to this.
4,Nikon S7c camera,"PRO:compact, small and flat.Large viewing screen.VersitileHandles 8gb SD cardsBetter than not having a camera but a full size Canon ESO or Nikon D80 are the way to go for real picture quality in fast bumpy conditions like wakeboarding.Con:Video is at a low resolution.Video imagage stability is shakey.Small on/off button and zoom buttoms are difficult to use.Changing from video to picture must be done by a menu.Slow operation compared to full size cameras.Protect the large screen, we broke ours snow skiing.Buy 4-6 extra batteries.Internal flash eats batteries quickly.Docking station is OK but would like cord only option for traveling."
5,A real treat,"When I come home really tired from work, I grab this book, jump into bed, and read it to relax. Time and again, it refreshed me and unwound me."
1,Don't Bother,"I guess the reason there were no audio samples on Amazon was because any potential buyer would have heard how awful the sound quality is, not to mention that many of the songs sound almost identical! I guess this is O.K. for history buffs and budding neo-Nazis, but not for anyone who expects there to be a certain power and majesty to the music, like Wagner, or even The Best Of Communism, or anything by the Red Army Choir instead of this. I wanted to like this, I really did."
1,One Guarantee...It's a Party Killer,"I didn't even know that this music was still sold - mainly because I naively thought ""Who in their right mind would want to listen to Nazi theme songs?"" But once again I am amazed at some of humanities' xenophobia. So this review goes out to all you neo-nazis, fascists, & racists: buy this album...listen to it frequently. This will guarantee that no woman will want to be near you, and the world will be spared of your offspring."
3,Blast From Our Past,"Very interesting recordings. Thanks to the digital revolution, us Baby Boomers and their children can now hear the music of another era, that will never be broadcast on public radio stations. My one complaint is that, perhaps, the sound quality could have been improved by using the original source tapes, if available."
4,Great book,"Great book. The state of cowboy hat ""fashion"" is at such a low right now - the same-old, same-old cattleman style. Though this publication is a few years out of date, the information in it gives those who want a really good hat - that fits them and looks like ""them"" plenty of history to consider, past sytles to look over, and enough information find a maker of a really good hat."
