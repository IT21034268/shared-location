3,Insufficiently Adjustable,"Here's the problem: even maxed out, these things are way too small for me. My head is average sized, not huge yet the Clics ride high on the nose defeating the bi purpose of readers.Otherwise they're a slick product. The magnets snap together with a satisfying click and you don't look quite like the alte kakker that you really are when wearing them.I'm ordering a pair of the long variety, which unfortunately don't seem to be readily available on Amazon..."
5,great specs,The clic reading glasses are very convenient and easy to use with the magnetic front click together design. Although I exchanged mine for a larger size to fit my larger head!
3,CliC Adjustable Glasses,"I bought these for someone who is constantly slipping their ""readers"" on/off at work, thinking this would be very convenient compared to having something dangling from a cord or going back/forth to pocket all the time. Unfortunately the size just didn't work well for them. With the side parts full extended, the glasses barely fit around the person's head, and if they smile or make a big facial expression, the front closure pops loose. I loved the concept of these glasses, but they just didn't work well for my situation."
4,"Just a ""click"" away!","These glasses are great! I could never find my glasses when I needed them. Now all I do is quickly pull them up, ""click"" together, and no more worries of lost glasses! Since I have another pair at home,I leave them on my desk and in the morning I'm back in business, when I am not using them ... I know where they are!! If you happen to be a teacher, nurse, receptionist, or even a Dr. I think you would find them to be very handy!!"
2,Very Uncomfortable,These glasses work as advertised but are very uncomfortable to wear. I would not recommend them.
2,Save your money,These glasses are very sturdy but they're so stiff and wide around your head that they don't stay on your nose. My neck aches when I wear them. Save your money...
1,Maybe a guy thing,At first I thought it would be a good idea...but actually they look horrible - like saftey glasses or something. Maybe if you are a geeky guy these are a good solution - but if you want to avoid looking like an idiot you should move on to something more stylish
4,CliC Readers Awesome,"I purchased the CliC Readers because I was always losing my regular readers and thought I could keep up with these. They are great. I am a nurse, so I just leave them hanging around my neck & they are right there when I need them. I do get a few stares & questions when I put them on, because it looks like your glasses are broken, but they are actually held together with a magnet at the nosepiece. The only drawback is that they are not adjustable to head size....they fit me perfectly, but if someone had a bigger head in circumference, it would be a problem. Overall, I am very pleased!"
4,Everyone wants to know where I got them,"Have a lot of folks wanting these for prescription lenses. Fine product delivered quickly. Only complaint I have is the lens size is too small. Needs bigger lens option as well as some way to handle wider nose bridge. Maybe offer a spacer or series of spacers to provide wider range of fit across bridge of nose. They also tend to ""walk"" up your neck when they are hanging from your neck & you turn your head back and forth as you tend to do in meetings. Overall, I still choose the Clics over traditional reading glasses."
5,Maybe it is because they are so simple......,"...that I find myself not losing these glasses as I have lost countless other ""readers"". They aren't stylish but if you are at an age where you don't give a darn, they serve their purpose. They are unobtrusive.You wear them 'round your neck and when you need them, just bring them up to your eyes, connect the magnets ( easy) and you are in busy. So simple that they are clever.Cannot put my finger on why they work so well but with Amazon's great return policy, try them. I think you will really like them but if you don't they are simple to return."
5,"For my Husband, hands free to work","Saw several friends with these ""readers"". One gent I did some stone work with had to constantly put his ""specs"" on to do some measuring. These ""Clics"" were perfect, he recommended them and I couldn't be happier. Great product. Purchase and delivery were excellent."
3,does not extend enough,"I bought two pairs because I've seen them around and liked the idea of getting rid of the usual eye glass neck string. The frames do extend, but not really far enough for me. When I wear these, they fit tightly, high up on my nose instead of resting lower like most reading glasses. After wearing them on and off all day at work, I get a head ache from having the lenses so close to my eyes and from the plastic frame behind my head. I wear my hair very short and could not imagine anyone with a lot of hair being able to use these.There is a definite ""cool"" factor and the glasses bring a lot of comments. I just wish they extended another inch or so."
4,Comment,Fine product. A little color in the frame would be a nice addition to the product. All in all I enjoy them very much.
4,"Great concept, very convenient",Love everything about these except that they are a bit tight even on the largest adjustment setting.
2,Clic Adjustable front connect glasses,"This is a good idea, but if you are a large man with a large neck and a large face, these glasses will not fit you.I gave mine away to a friend that could fit them."
2,igottaview,"These glasses were a bit of a disappointment. The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment. And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use. Great idea but maybe some ""fine tuning"" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck."
4,satisfactory,"Glasses work great the only problem was they were a little tight around the head of a man and they could not be adjusted enought, but they worked."
5,Great glasses!,"This is the second pair of CliC glasses I've gotten. The first one lasted for several years of daily use before one of the arms broke (from so much use!). When I was waiting for my new ones to arrive, I taped the old ones together because I would have been lost without them. My only complaint would be that I could use a stronger magnification, such as 2.50 strength, and the highest strength available was 2.00. But, other than that, I really recommend these reading glasses."
5,I don't loose my glasses anymore,"I love the clic readers! I have 3 pairs myself and have purchased another 6 pairs as presents. What makes them so great is they come in 3 different colors, easily adjustable,and hang from your neck. Bottom line is I don't loose my glasses anymore! Yahoo! No more frustration!Go ahead and treat yourself buy that first pair. I bet you will buy more and pass them on."
4,Great attention getter!!!!!,"This is about my 5th pair of Clics. I love them - as a teacher they are indispensible if you constantly lose your glasses. I can't tell you how many times people have asked me what they are. They get pretty banged up wearing them around your neck all the time (I pretty much do), but the price is right so I order a new pair every few months. Buy them - you won't be sorry."
2,One size does not fit all!,"Nice idea and they seem well made, but if your head is larger than average, they won't fit.As soon as I tilt my head up, they un-snap.A shame really....Just read about the inventor in Fortune Small Business and it's a great story, but an investment in other sizes would be wise."
2,Uncomfortable and awkward,"They are good but not great. My head is not parade float size, but they are snug to uncomfortable after wearing they for a while.I must've missed the fact that the neck strap is rigid. If you tilt your head up, it will be annoying because that neck strap/pipe thing will push the glasses forward.I got the clear, the downside is the magnet is visible so you will be rocking a Revenge of the Nerds taped glasses look.Otherwise, good reading glasses. Too big for my taste, going back to cheaper readers with an over the counter cloth neck strap. Those are not worth the expense."
2,Clic glasses,This product should be available in stores in order to be tried on to determine fit and feel. Does not work well with long hair. I found it to be more a hassle than a help.
3,CliC Adjustable Front Connect Reader reading glasses,"Seemed like a good product, sturdy, attractive and exactly the kind of reading glasses my husband wanted. Unfortunately, they did not fit him even when the ear pieces were adjusted to their maximum length. The magnet on the front would not meet or engage. My husband is a big man so apparently these were just too small for his size. We'll keep looking."
4,What a great invention,"CliC Adjustable Front Connect Reader, 2.00 Strength, Clear FrameThese glasses have saved me hours of searching for a pair of readers that I have misplaced!!!! Everywhere I go someone asks me ""where did you get those glasses?""I even wore them golfing and not a problem.... they never moved from my neck. I recommend these glasses to anyone that needs glasses to read. Clics are always around your neck never on top off your head ruining your hair or laid down on a table somewhere.I can't wait to try the Clic sunglass readers."
3,'Clic' printed in white on glass surface; wrong strength,"I purchased these glasses based on a referral from someone I saw wearing them.The blue pair I received had the 2.50 mag label affixed but stamped on the frame is 3.00, which may explain why I had so much trouble with them at first.The tortoise shell pair have the word 'Clic' painted on the surface of the glass, which is very annoying, being just at the edge of vision.The concept is great. But it might be worth buying them in a store where you can see if you're getting the right strength and find out if having the name painted on the glass surface bothers you."
1,TOO SMALL,I read the reviews before purchasing these glasses. I did not think I would have any problem with the size as I have a fairly small head size. They cut into the side of my temples and above my ear and were unwearable. I am returning them!
3,interesting idea,"I am dependent on readers for any close work (including cooking) and have them scattered all over the house. I like that the CliC readers can be worn around the neck and stay out of the way. They are extremely easy to use and very convenient. BUT... for women? The stiff back smooshes hair down at the sides of the head, and as my husband told me, it's not a good look. A more flexible rear band might be better. The other negative thing is that if I'm leaning my head against anything while wearing them (a pillow or arm of a sofa, for instance) the glasses are pushed off my nose and become useless. Again, a softer back band might solve this problem. So while they won't replace my tried and true often misplaced readers, they are definitely a positive and useful addition to my ""collection."""
1,They did not fit me and clear frame is really cheap lookingThes,"These glasses do not work. not only do they look cheap (worst of plastic ever!) they never fit anyone properly!! and the lenses are even worst! they fog up so easily, scratch even with tissue and none of the four i bought have the right prescribed reading grade. save your money - not even worth a penny. If you must have them, the black looks half way decent. Red really looks the worst of the bunch - looks like toy plastic."
1,Unable to test it - I'm NOT in the US!!,"I tried to purchase a CliC reader -- unfortunately, I was NOT allowed to do so as I live in Australia!The idea sounds great, and probably lots of my friends in our embroidery group (and their friends) would have been interested as well, but - I can't purchase the initial set.Bit short-sighted -- I definitely will NOT buy at an inflated price at your choice of importer."
3,Teenage Riot,"Ever wonder how the top-ranked reviewers force their way to the top?They vote for their own reviews over and over.So brilliant. So clever. But not ""well-done""!Talk about the triumph of noise over signal, chaos over order, and quantity over quality!"
1,Misleading Album Title,"52 cover versions all by the same band, Mask.No point! Originals please?Very misleading title to these CDs. Definitely not ""As Heard on TV"""
5,Peter Parker is Spider Man,"Spider man was made by the same people as Tony Hawk. If you have ever played Tony Hawk's Proskater, you know how addictive it is. This game is just as addictive. Unlike Superman 64, there are very few glitches. If you want to beat the game without cheats, beat it first without even looking at the codes because the cheats make it too fun to ever go back. One con is that the webslinging from building to building is 2-dimensional. It is easy to overcome this though. Other than that, it is a very fun game. I do think they shpuld have made a cheat to become Venom because Venom is awesome!"
2,The best Spiderman game.,"This game has an extensive bunch of moves, maneuvers, special items, secrets and it has a huge amount of Spiderman memorabilia in it. This is a very detailed Spiderman game because it is a whole 3D world, you as Spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building, hang upside-down, create a web shield, web the band guys or create web boxing gloves. Everyone is included, like Venom, Carnage, the Scorpion, Rhino, and a 50 ft Mysterio. You must beat them each in a unique way, rather than just beating them up. There are twenty-five levels, however, the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours, which makes it like a movie. To add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits, characters, 3D profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comic."
2,Dissapointing,"This game is OK, but there is one big problem with it. My friend brought his to my house the other day and I began playing it. And in, at the most, 2 hours, I beat it! No memory pak needed. There are only like 5 or 6 bosses in the game and the rest is just mindless slinging from one thing to another killing all the baddies. There are so many mini little puzzle type things that are just too easy and useless. He brought it over again last night and I beat it again--on hard difficulty. This game was a great idea, and the graphics and sound are great... but c'mon guys, you coulda done better than that."
1,The worst game I have ever played,I bought this game because it had Superman on the front. Big mistake. The graphics are horrible and far too simple for the N64. The gameplay is awkward and hard to control. But the worst part of this game is the story. It took about 2 seconds to think up and the game spends just as much time on the storyline. The whole point is boring- flying through endless hoops and other monotonous unexciting tasks. This game is horrible. Buy Spiderman instead- at least you wont want to throw Spiderman out of the window.
2,"Wha' Happened, Dave?","I played this CD last night after not having heard it in a long time and it was agonizing to listen to this choppy, dysfunctional playing by one of my favorite jazz pianists. McKenna sounds angry, hostile, disoriented, often as if he's not sure of what he's going to do next.Why was it recorded let alone released? Contractural obligation? For McKenna at his best listen to ""Giant Strides"" or ""Left-Handed Complement"" or just about anything but ""Easy Street"". My copy is in my resale pile."
1,Dave was way off base with this recording,"This is one of the many cds I have in my collection by DM. In the case of this cd, i'm embrassed to own it. It really came up short of what I have come to expect from this master jazz pianist.Dave seemed like he was in another world while playing on this cd. I never could seem to feel his pulse or the soul he was trying to convey. I know it is hard to always top your past performances, but this is not the Dave McKenna I have come to appreciate.I want my money back!"
5,Headlight,"Replacing a headlight should be easy, the bulb worked once I was able to finally get inside and get the old bulb out. I'm convinced dealers want you to bring the car in so they can bill you for one hour of labor."
2,too much $,I felt like I had been had. This was for my daughter and she gets the same soup mix at the grocery store for much less. This is a time when I should have checked the grocery store before buying on-line.
1,FISH TASTE IS TOO STRONG,"This soup would be more rightly called FISH SOUP, rather than miso soup. It has miso listed as one of the ingredients, but the BONITO fish overpowers everything else. Although I like fish, I really hate this soup and I feel cheated by the money I spent on it."
4,Beim ersten Mal tut es noch weh,"(3.5/5 stars) Komm auf die Schaukel. Jetz geht der Hans Albers los. The Hamburger's best-known songs are here, from ""Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts un halb eins"" to ""Ich bin der Hans im Glueck"" and ""In Hamburg an der Elbe."" Sure, some are corny (""Mein Gorilla hat ein Villa im Zoo"") and others schmaltzy (""Ganz dahinten, wo der Leuchtturm steht""). Forget the fact that Albers doesn't so much ""sing"" as he does recite; he does it with style and that's all that matters. You know all the songs (or at least some of them), so sing along! If you aren't familiar with Hans Albers or his home city of Hamburg, there isn't a whole lot to recommend about this CD. It is more nostalgic than it is good, though it does have a certain charm."
2,Not one of the best,"Overall the album was boring, some great songs but others were so bland that I sold the cd shortly after buying it."
2,Had promise but poorly executed,"Activision has a dubious track record for making great and near excellent Spider-Man games and making poor and lacking X-Men games. Why this is is anyone's guess, and X-Men: Mutant Wars for the GameBoy Color is one of these types of games featuring everyone's favorite merry band of mutants. In this 2-D side scroller you get to pick from Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Iceman, and Gambit as you take out hordes of generic baddies and then take on bosses, most of which are most well known even to casual X-Men fans. The graphics are nice and colorful and look surprisingly good, and each character's powers are presented well, but the overall feel of the game just feels unfinished and the levels are poorly designed. If your a GameBoy gamer of any kind and are a fan of the X-Men then this game is worth a look, but don't expect anything remotely redeeming from it."
3,Okay.........,"good selection and all but it had lack of dificultie. If you liked the playstation version, this is half as good."
4,"Adequate, yet not overbearing summation of modern psychology","Schultz and Schultz offer a wonderful summation of the history of psychology. Many history of psychology texts are large and burdensome, but Schultz and Schultz sift out the waste and offer the facts. Interesting anecdotes about psychology's pioneers are offered, and the social climate surrounding the perspectives of each school of thought is also mentioned. All in all, this is a great book to have in the collection for the average historian of psychology. The authors, unfortunately, do present the information in a rather bland display. More color and layout effect would be useful and appealing. Furthermore, the chapter on the impact of women and minorities in psychology should not just be thrown on the end of the book ... it should be integrated throughout. Other than those two drawbacks, however, the book is wonderfully done."
4,History source of psychology,"We are using this book in our class. I do think it is a great book compared to others I have read. I like that they filter through and supply just facts. If you need to know how psychology came about and who attributed to it, this is an excellent source to read. I can say there are times its hard for me to put down the book, then other areas seem to be hard to grasp. Over all the book is a great reference and started book in the history of psychology"
4,PRE JOHANSEN DOLLS,"COOL CD. IT IS ROUGH DEMOS BEFORE DAVID JOHANSEN BECAME THE LEAD SINGER. THESE ARE THE EARLIEST DOLLS DEMOS THAT I AM AWARE OF. THEY WERE EVEN CALLING THEMSELVES ACTRESS AT THIS TIME.YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE TITLES, BUT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE SONGS, WHICH LATER BECAME DIFFERENT TITLES. JOHNNY THUNDERS SINGS ALL SONGS AND WHILE HE DOES AN ADMIRABLE JOB, HEARING FUTURE DOLLS CD'S WITH DAVID JO YOU CAN SEE HE WAS THE MISSING PIECE TO THE PUZZLE. WHILE THE DEMOS ARE ROUGH, THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR ANY DOLLS FANS AND ESPECIALLY JOHNNY THUNDERS FANS. IT ALSO FEATURES ORIGINAL DRUMMER BILLY MURCIA, WHO IS NOT FEATURED ON MANY OF THEIR CD'S."
4,:),"Yes aimed at the young adults, but gods what fun, the family of the main charactors is nearly as crazy as mine, the politics are to die for, the dialogue is well done, and each character feels real."
3,Chaos and management theory meet up,"Jones is usually little lighter than this, but her premise that one magical world has been contracted to provide harrowing tours to off worlders year after year and is rebelling after forty years, means there is death and pain mixed with lighter moments. Predictions come true, but plans fail in this book about contract breaking. Year of the griffin is lighter. The objectors have apparently missed the serious tone of fairy tales, young adult novels in general, and the wars in Narnia and Middle Earth. Balancing the family drama and character development with plot seemed more challenging in this book, because there are no many fronts to be faced."
3,"Good, but not her best","Diana Wynne Jones has written many wonderful fantasy novels, and often they have included controversial elements (the child trying to kill the stepfather in The Ogre Downstairs, for example). Usually, they are essential to the plot. I didn't care for, however, the gang rape of the 16 year old which occurs barely offstage, since it could have been excised without affecting the plot. But more than that, the plot is confusing and unfocused. Having looked at (it is hard to say ""read"") her Dark Guide to Fantasyland, or whatever it is called, I think Jones wrote this to poke fun at D&D, and it really didn't work. She's far better when she starts from a blank canvas--her recent ""Deep Secret"", while including equally disturbing elements (the murder of three young children, for example), was a wonderful book, and those murders were essential to the plot and to the character development of at least one main character."
1,"If you laugh when someone slips on a banana and gets hurt, this book is for you.","This is the fictional version of Jones' Tough Guide to Fantasyland. I enjoyed that book. Not this one, though. It is over 500 pages of sadism which, apparently, is supposed to be funny. It is not.I absolutely would not allow a child to read it and I would be suspicious of any adult who enjoyed it."
3,"""Not too Bad, but Good""","Evil wizards, magic spells, and dragons are just some of the stuff contained in this book. Derk, the newly appointed dark lord, is the main character in the book, who defeats the main evil dark lord, Mr. Chasney,at the end. Derk creates half-human, Half-beasts for a living before he was appointed. He, as dark lord, has to bring pilgrum parties from one place to anther filled with criminals. I like the book some because of the magic in it, but it was too long of a book."
3,Not her best,"I really enjoy most of DWJ's books, but this one didn't strike the right note for me. I didn't like the rape scene, which other reviewers have mentioned- it wasn't necessary to the plot, and the whole ""instant cure"" aftermath felt like it was inappropriately downplaying a serious matter. Also, it seemed like some other wrongs were done that were forgiven awfully quickly, like what Querida did to Derk and Mara. And, I didn't like Derk promising Pretty to the elven prince- it made Pretty (a winged horse)seem a slave or chattel which doesn't really suit Derk or the general humorous nature of the book. I don't mind DWJ's multitude of characters or twisting plotlines- in fact, I enjoy them- but this one wasn't my favorite because too many elements made me wince. I prefer Dogsbody, Archer's Goon, and the Chrestomanci books, as well as a few titles that I can't remember at the moment."
3,This is a book about FLOWCHARTING,"I was looking for books on storyboarding as in film and comics. I want work out the problems of my story artistically. This book is about corporate stuff. In that way, it seems to be very detailed.These are the chapters:1. Background and introduction.2. The importance of teams.3. Problem solving.4. Quality improvement tools.5. Identify the problem. Find the reason for improvement.6. Understand the problem and the current situation.7. Analyze the problem.8. Generate potential action.9. Evaluate and select actions.10. Action.11. Appraise or Evaluate.12. DocumentationAppendix A. Storyboard Examples for Health Care and EducationB. Comparison of problem-solving structures.C. Tool pagesThis might be the PERFECT book for someone who is not writing a story, but trying to solve problems at the office."
5,Yummy honey!!,"I love honey so these gels were a great choice for me while running. I don't cramp with these. I got the gold flavor because it is plain, the others sounded gross. I am very small and petite so I only slurp down half at a time and drink to wash it down. The gel definitely gives that extra ""oomph"" I need while running. Try these out. If you don't want such a big pack you can purchase individually on the honey stinger website. Enjoy!"
5,Best Tasting Gel!,I love these gels. I have tried other gels and this one is the best tasting gel I've had. It is sweet since it's made from honey. I also love the chews. Great for marathon and half marathon training.
5,The BEST... for honey lovers,"I'm a heavy user of gels for distance running, and I was thrilled to discover the Honey Stinger Gold flavored gel this year. I buy this stuff by the 24-pack and never get tired of it. If you don't love honey, try my second favorite gel - Powerbar's Kona Punch flavored gel."
4,great fuel!,I have used this during trail runs and cycling with no stomach upset and no crash afterwards. Just keep moving to avoid attracting bees...or bears with the honey :)
5,yummy!,"i have used stingers honey flavor and wanted to try the strawberry flavor. i prefer the honey, but the strawberry is a great alternative flavor and it works the same. out of all the gels i have used, stingers are the best for their flavor, taste, residue (none), aftertaste (none), viscosity (smooth), and cost (same as others). my second favorite gel is the cliff bar brand. i also purchased the stinger bar and it is just like a milkyway without the candy action. for those of you whom want a gel that is smooth and easygoing and provides the perfect energy delivery, then stingers are the perfect choice. i mountain and road bike by the way."
4,Yum!,"What could be better than a mouth full of honey with a caffeinated kick?! The price for Honeystinger seems more justifiable compared to other gels as they're made using 100% made in the USA bee pee. Other gels use corn based products which means they're dependent more heavily on petroleum based industrial agriculture (the price of a pound of maltodextrin--the main calorie containing ingredient in Gu and others-- hasn't even remotely kept pace with inflation thanks to farm subsidies... but it's price has paralleled the price of oil).I'm still not keen on the little gel packs and prefer to buy bottles and use refillable flasks instead. Also, the honey is of course really, really sweet (so delicious!) which makes it more difficult to get down smoothly."
2,Nasty taste,"Great for when you need a sugar rush, very high in simple carbs, and easy to swallow, but the Strawberry flavor is NOT tasty. I find the Carb Boom gels much more palatable, and the Accel Gel pretty good and not as thick, so easier to swallow."
5,"Great cycling food, and saves me alot of trips to the local store","There is one store in town that has honey stingers, and right before all the major bike rides, it sells out of the Honey Stinger Golds. These boxes keep me from worrying about having enough when I need them. And honey stingers are so much better than the other energy gels, whose taste & texture don't agree with me."
3,Animorphs,First of all I love the Animorphs books. Though I didn't like the way it ended. I read all of them. I did love all the action and comedy that was told very well. I loved the fact that there was going to be a video game. I was worried that it would be like the TV show which I thought was terrible. It thankfully was like the books. Great animation in the movies. They showed what before I could only see in my mind. It also showed hork-bajar tougher than andalites fixing a problem with the books. The levels had good graphics. They were fun and chalenging with lots of action. Now for the problems with the game. You didn't get to play as Ax or Tobias. There were not enough levels and they all took place on earth. Many of the aliens you fight never were in the books and made no sense. The biggest problem is you can't morph at will. The game morphs for you. Why are you always jumping around as a human instead of morphing bird.
3,disappointed,As a fan of the animorphs book series I was a bit disappointed with the new animorphs game for playstation<shattered reality>.Although the game kept the player interested it didn't quite give justice to the animorphs story and lacked a certain ingredient to make the game complete.I was disappointed to find out that the player could not choose when they wanted to morph. The graphics were good though.Although it wasn't as good as I had expected I still enjoyed playing it and would not discourage anyone from buying it.I encourage buyers to get information on the game and understand what it includes before purchasing it in a hope that future buyers will not be disappointed if it doesn't have what they thought.
4,Animorphs Game Review,"I recently bought Animorphs : Shattered Reality and I really like it, once you learn how to play it, it is a really cool game.You can choose who you want to play as which also makes the game fun."
3,Looking back...,"Let's wind the clock back to the year 2000. This kind of stuff was generaly new. it was what people wanted. people were happy with this kind of game. eventualy, the books died out, and, like a firework, the once impressive book and video game was out-shined by a new and brigher franchise, until it was compleatly forgoten and left on shelves to gather dust.Somware along 2006, i picked up the long dead books and started to read them. in 2007, I started collecting the series, very much interested in this actient history. in 2008, i had them all, along with the megamorphs and the elimist chronicles. to compleate my collection, i wanted the games, and ordered shattered reality.and was dissipointed, to say the least.i didn't exspect much, but it compleatly sucked. it's graphics and gameplay belong on a gameboy, not a PS2."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I actually rented this game because it sounded interesting and original, and when I popped in into the old playstation, I was expecting just that. Boy, was I wrong. This game is so boring. You never do anything except jump around avoiding pitfalls and collecting coins (groan). Oh, once in awhile there will be a battle, you'll know when they're coming because all of a sudden you morph into some animal depending on which character you chose it the beginning. Battles are lame and boring. Every single enemy can be easily defeated using the old hit and run method. There doesn't seem to be any point to this game and if that isn't bad enough, wait until you hear the voice talent (or should I say lack of talent). So CHEESY! I'm sorry I even wasted the money on a rental. DONT BUY THIS LAME GAME UNLESS YOU ARE SIX YEARS OLD OR TOTALLY DESPARATE!"
2,sad,when I heard that there was going to be a animorph game I was really excited.but to my disapointment the game sorta ... it was to easy and you barely saw tobias in the game and you never got to fight visser three just that big monster thing.the game was ok but I wouldn't really want to buy it
2,Save the Money,"This game isn't very good.The graphics aren't good,the animorphs aren't fast enough,and it's just plain boring.If you want a good game,check out Crash Team Racing."
5,A CLASSIC ALBUM,"If Columbia would only re-release all their artists albums like this, the world would be a better place, musically, anyways. This album comes from sessions with long-time Columbia arranger and conductor Percy Faith with the timeless vocals of Johnny Mathis. Both vocals and arrangements are flawless, reverent, and beautiful. Johnny's version of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is the most touching I've ever heard. Both ""Ave Maria""s are outstanding as well. The title track, ""Good Night, Dear Lord"" is a plaintive prayer set to music that really sets the mood without being overly ""religious"", if you will. But perhaps the greatest stand-out on this disc is the absolutely beautiful ""I Heard A Forest Praying"". This album is a welcoome addition to the listener of ANY denomination."
5,FUN! This guy has CHOPS!!,"What a joy this CD is! Filled with humor, finesse and style - Monty is a master!! I heard the cut SPEAK LOW on KLON a few months ago and had to get this album - and to my delight, the rest of the cuts are as infectious, intelligent and playful as that one. In this solo setting, Monty is like a sexy Dick Hyman - irrepressible - a little less technically ""precise"" and ""perfect""- but thrilling all the same, and oh, so much fun!!"
1,Huge disappointment,"I bought the DVD version for our children hoping that they would learn to appreciate art history and understand art trends that have impacted culture throughout history. Boy, was I disappointed. The DVD says it is intended for children age 5 through 11. However, the author, Patricia Robinson, delivers her lectures in this DVD by talking about art in a dry and erudite manner. I did not want lectures but rather a compilation of major art works throughout history with a trend emerging from the presentation. Clearly this was not the case."
1,Bigfoot looses my interest,"I was hoping for some more info on the bigfoot mystery, but all I got was an X-rated comic book that couldn't hold my interest. So anyone wanting to know more about the monster needs to go elsewhere."
3,hot boys,"this cd was okay.theHa remix with the hot boys is the best song.''ha,off the top,souljah rags,and welcme to the nolia were good,too.its jus okay."
1,"It's not real hip hop and I'm from the south, He's wack.","This guy says nothing. I'm tired of people from the south thinking they're so hot. I'm from Tennesse and love alot of south artists. But this guy is no where. He needs to listen to true hip hop heads like Redman Biggie, and Jay z as well as Krs one.The only real hot artists in the south are Eightball, Outkast, Goodie Mob and Scarface. Not Juvenile."
1,Pure Garbage,"i bought the edited version for my son, they curse so much through the cd that the songs are butchered,definetly a waste of money, MUST RAPPERS CURSE EVERY TWO SECONDS dont they realise they would sell more albums if they didnt,since more people would would be able to purchase it(younger crowd) i felt like snapping this cd in two bits. we need more people like will smith,usher and mase"
4,Hot Boys Be On Fire,"What kinda *igga got gold in his mouth, What kinda *igga got twenty on his wrist, fifteen on his neck, million dollar status *igga that be on top of yo girl, The Hot Boys The Hot Boys, They be on fire, you heard me..."
4,this is a good cd,THIS IS A GOOD CD AND IF I HAD THE MONEY I WOULD BUY IT BUT I'LL BUY IT LATER SORRY JUVENILLE.
5,THIS CD IS OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!,"CASH MONEY OFF THE HEZEE AIN'T NOBODY MESS WIT JUVE,FRESH,BABY,TURK,LIL WAYNE,OR B.G.'Z. THEY JUST OFF THE HOOK. ANY WAY THIS CD IS HOT ALL THE SONGS ON THERE ARE ALL REAL! THEY JUST CAN'T BE STOPPED"
4,didn`t think JUVENILE COULD FLOW THIS GOOD,"THIS cd is not for everyone.But i found everything, from the funky intro to the amazing ""run for it"" to be hot.Some of Juve`s boys don`t do that well,but if yon like the hiphop\hardcore flow, i would recommend it"
5,Juvenile is off tha hook!!!!!!!!!!,"Juvenile is off tha hook on this album. Have y'all heard his second album solja rags? If not pick it up because it is all that!! Oh, and one more thing, Juvenile is also on a song called ""Big Bodies"" with beelow. Check that song out because it it blazin!!!! Call your local rap station and tell them to crank that mutha f***in song up!! If your area doesn't play that kind of stuff (example: New york, L.A.) then go by the album ""ballin for billions"", one of the best albums the dirty south has to offer!!!! Peace!"
5,A Fan From Da South,the CD rocks my favorite song is Run For It everyone has to go out right now and get it.
3,iam a dj i liked 8 songs on cd.,"iam a dj from dallas tx, and i listen to the cd and i liked 8 out 16 on the cd. i play it at partys."
4,it has a really new latino R&B hiphop beat that i love,juvenile is new and fresh and seems like hes been through the game before...hes hot off 400 degreeez..and i love him.. somethin bout his music makes u wanna bounce . his two new singles follow me and HA! are phat...follow me is a good latino kinda beat that gives me this little feeling in me that makes me wanna jump up and dance...inna way juvenile is cute too..but im probaly the only one who thinks that...(?????)
1,generic rap,"I've got to give juvy credit, one mans trash is anothers treasure. He made this junk, (...)If these youngsters are what I have to look forward too in rap I think I'll change to country and western. (...)"
4,The best of the best of the best!,This CD Juvinile is awsome. It has everything. I bought it from Amazon.com and I don't regret it. I reccomend you to buy it today. And hurry and tell all your friends about it so they can enjoy it too.
2,waste of a cd,"i thought it was terrible, after hearing remix after remix of the same horrible song i decided never to listen to it unless some one else made me"
1,I AM A HATER YES I AM,"WHAT is wrong with you people? This CD is not worth buying. Cash Money is already played out. None of the CMR rappers have talent. No Limit is better than Cash Money because they have at least 2 or 3 rappers wit talent. I can't believe that SO many people like down south music. If there there was a Canibus CD on the shelf and a Juvie CD. I bet 95 percent of the people would buy the Juvenile album. What is the world comin' to? Real rappers like Reakwon, Canibus, Killa Priest, Common. They all gettin' sleeped on! You gotta start listening to rappers with talent, and not just makin' up any word that rhymes."
2,same thing,"the same thing is said over and over, the only creative thing done on this cd is how many ways he can say the same thing over and over again"
5,SIMPLY THA BEST!,"THIS IS GOT TO BE THE BEST RAP ALBUM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.I HAVE BOUGHT 2PAC,JAY-Z,DR DRE,SNOOP,BUT THE FACT IS THAT 400 DEGREE$ IS THE BEST RAP ALBUM YOU CAN BUY.IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST.CA$HMONEY IS SIMPLY THE BEST! EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM IS OFF DA HOOK! PICK UP ON THIS 1!"
5,THIS CD IS WHAT YOU CALL A MASTERPIECE!,"IF YOU CAN'T RELATE TO WHAT THIS CAT IS SAYING, THEN YOU'RE ""COMMON"" AND YOU NEED TO FIND ""SENSE"". THIS DUDE IS NO LYRACIST, BUT CAN MY BOY BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU OR WHAT IN ONE OF THE TIGHTEST FLOWS AROUND. MANNIE FRESH AND BEOWULF NEED TO HAVE A GROUP MEETING WITH SOME OF THESE GUYS THAT MAKE TRACKS OUT THERE AND TEACH THEM A THING OR TWO ABOUT HOW GANGSTA PARTY MUSIC IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND. THE HOTBOYZ AND MANNIE FRESH ARE A SUPERB COMBINATION. BUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER IS LIKE GUMBO WITHOUT THE SPICES."
5,"Great Cd, but help","THis is a great CD but i got the wrong copy. I heard that there was an original copy with two songs there that were replaced. And I heard that there was another version on Tha G-Code. If somebody knows where to find versions not commonly sold in stores, pleaze, pleaze, pleaze, EMAIL me! But what can I say? The cd that I have is amazing, only I don't like the way Universal had edited it. But that's the only thing that spoiled the Cd. Otherwise,it was the best cd i've ever gotten. I like especially ""Gone Ride With Me"" and ""Back that Azz up"", ""Ghetto Children"", and ""Follow me Now"" But I'd like to hear the other two songs that are not there! Pleaze tell me how!"
5,HOT BOYS AND JUVENILE ARE THE BEST,I LOVE HOT BOYS AND MOST OF ALL JUVENILE. THE WHOLE GROUP JUST MAKES ME WANT TO SCREAM WHEN EVER I HEAR ANY OF THERE SONGS.I LOVE THERE NEW CD GORILLA WARFARE.ITS OF THE HOOK.THE WHOLE CASH MONEY CLIQUE IS OF THE CHAIN!
4,Holdin it down,"I just want to say its hot first of all, but he's still new to the game so i got to give it 4 stars. If he can keep on producing the phat flava to keep my head bobbin then it might get a 5 next time. But I got to say cashmoney crew be representing to the fullest. Juvenile is hot the CD is all of 400 degrees."
5,This album is tha bomb ya dig,juvenile #1 in my book i used to like master p until solja rags but the no limit soldiers compared to the CASH MONEY millionaires c'mon gimme a break ill definitly FOLLOW HIM NOW
5,99-00 C-M-B #1,This album in my opinion is the best work of Juvenile! The song are great and my favorite one is Back That Thang Up! I extremely recommend this album to you Cash Money Fans!
1,Das ist richtig!,"Wo ist die Kampferstellung? Zusammen nacht unter den Hausenflueter gespricht...oder mein Rauschning kranzvargulden kopfeln, bitte! Mir keine viel geld aber einen wissenschaften gedankenbringen. So schwer, so schwer.Beruchten sie uber das ganz musikliederscheissen essen?"
3,anthem king indeed!,"Read the below review Street-Hop-1977 wrote titled ""Street Anthem King.""That pretty much sums up all there is to say about Juvenile and 400 Degreez.Yeah, Juvey's good for a few hit party singles from time to time. Yes, he a Southern rap legend and yes, 400 Degreez is considered his classic.Juve got skills, but Wayne is better now!"
1,"no, just no (please stop rapping)","i heard one of these songs on MTV hits, and i just laughed. Wow, what is this? I couldn't even understand the words, then looked them up online, and saw the lyrics were weak. Then I listened to some more songs, and they were all terrible. I then thought ""what did this get on amazon? 2 stars?"" Actually, 4 1/2! That's the same as some great 2pac cd's, biggie's ready to die, and many other masterpieces. 4 1/2 stars usually means flawless, and only some people give it 1 star because they dont like the artist to drag it down. But this cd is no masterpiece. It is not anything near that. It is no classic. Buy some good cd instead of this trash. Start with 2pac's Greatest Hits, and then find some other classics like Nas's ""Illmatic"", and then say what you think of this cd. Heck, it deserves 0 stars. But seriously, buy the cd's i've mentioned, and you'll never play this trash again."
1,What is the world coming to?,"Rap and hip hop...while there are rare moments of excellence (rappers delight, anything by digable planets or wyclef, and the occasional dre, eminem, coolio, and a few others), the overall feeling i get from rap is disgust. Although this cd is better than stuff like Mobb Deep, the lyrics are still lacking any insight. I dont know why these rappers feel the need to further adulterate the radio waves with such degrading and noisy ""music"". Its a shame to see my brother joining the army of many ignorant people who dont know what good music sounds like. I dont recommend this cd to anyone, but offer an alternative: look into other types of music, dont support this stuff anymore. learn to use the english language, and maybe sound intelligent. I wish i could go back to a time when rap didnt exist and talented people like Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Bob Marley, and countless others represented African Americans in music."
1,WACK !,"C'mon, what's this? Give up rapping and CMR will never get No Limit's crown! No Limit will be da #1 Rap-Label 4ever! And so 4 y'all who want real rap, buy DA 504 BOYZ when it comes out! (May 2nd?)"
5,CLASSIC ALBUM,"I BROUGHT THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND STILL LISTEN TO IT TO THIS DAY , CLASSIC JUVENILE ALBUM"
5,THIS ALBUM IS H.O.T,"Believe me when i say this an excellent album, especially if u like hip-hop, I am not even a fan of cash money, I think there all bigheaded rappers who are rich for no reason (except for juvenile who is so underated), but this album is excellent, a lot of good tracks thanks to the heavy production of mannie fresh, but juveniles flow is tight and his unique voice make it good to listen to, I don't really skip any tracks when listening to this. In my view there are several really good songs on this track but my favourites are 'HA', (original version, though both remixes are also good), 'BACK THAT THANG UP' and 'RUN 4 IT', the only thing i didn't really like about this album were the cash money interludes and the fact that other cash money representatives such as lil wayne (who i don't really like), are involved in it to a high extent.But this album is definetly the best that cash money have produced and in my view one of the best SOUTHERN rap albums."
4,4 1/2 stars--this album still bumps today,"Don't hate on Juvenile just because he was associated with Cash Money, ""bling bling"", and late '90s rap. Because this kid is nice with the lyrics. There are many highlights on this album like ""Back Dat A Up"", ""Follow Me Now"", ""Gone Ride Wit Me"", ""U.P.T."", and the list goes on. There is no song that is a waste of time (okay, maybe we didn't need two remixes of ""HA"" on the same album, even though both are tight), and every time I pop this album in, it takes me back to 1998-99."
5,""" IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL !","this album is the realest ever. but all i have to say is ""juve if you are looking at this, keep doin what cha' gotta do, and make it even better on ""tha G-CODE."""" hurry up and finish it cuz i can't wait til that one right there come out!"
5,You better back that thang up,"All I want to say is if you dare walk out of a record store without this CD, you better Back That Azz Up and get it right now."
5,The whole CD is the bomb!!!,"I think the whole CD is wonderful, and it is great that more black men are doing something better with there life then wasting it. I am very proud to be a great fan of his. I give you much respect. Keep doing a good job. I would like to be a cool rapper one day."
4,Good HipHop,"Juvenile is a damn good Rapper. But he's not asa good as DMX or Dr. Dre. If you like Hot Boys or Big Tymers, I would suggest you to buy this CD. But even if you don't like Big Tymers, you'll like this Album."
1,This Ablum Sucks. Dont BUY.,"There are only 3 good songs on this ablum 2 listen 2, all the rest of the songs are wack. This ablum is not worth the money. Trust me I have the ablum and I will never buy another Cash Money Record ablum again. If you dont have this ablum your not missing anything"
1,Not what I thought it would be,"The only songs on this cd that were good was ""Follow Me Now"" ""HA"" the remix featuring Jay-Z and ""Back that Azz Up"" other than that I didn't care much 'bout it. Now if you wanna hear a cd check out No Limit's cds' here at Amazon.com"
2,Ha! Don't make me laugh.,"This cd from juvenille is not even worth the money. I think If you want to listen , you should just listen to it at a store or just find someone who has it. The single ""ha"" has kind of a good beat, but the lyrics are wack. Come on, it sounds like he's humming and mumbling at the same time. His flow is not even as tight as Master P and his crew and I don't listen to them that much. I saw him perform live on The tonight show with conan and he sounded bad. They did the ha remix and the only thing that saved them was the drummer showing off at the end. If you want this ha!, take it from me you should listen to some of it first ha!, cause It really ain't as hot as it looks ha!"
1,Pathetic,"The ""artist"" makes it very clear with his selection of words that he is not interested in helping others achieve an existence any better than ghetto thug. The music videos are crude, the language is childish, and the overall mentality aligns the rapper and his fans with the greatest of failures in this society."
1,LOL @ this garbage,"Juvenile is the perfect example of a rapper who waste great beats. He has great beats some better more talented rapper can use but he takes them for his amateur, elementary lyrics. His flow and his delivery is horrible. He has no originality and cant rhyme worth a damn. He just uses ""aye"" ""yeah"" ""yo"" at the end of each line to make it rhyme.Only good thing about the trash is the beats and throwing distance."
5,Much tighter than you'd think!!,"If you think that ""Ha"" sucked (which I did) You'll be really surprised by how tight this album really is. The rest of Juve's beats are tight and he flows perfectly to them. This is definitely my favorite album from Cash Money Records!"
4,Absolutely Wonderful,These 'crackers' are absolutely delicious. I can use them the same way as any cracker with soft spreads or for dipping. I would highly recommend them. My only problem with them is the price. It is outrageous. I will beg my local stores to carry them as when you add shipping to the price of these crackers you are being robbed.
2,wafer chips,"This is not a product I would ever order again. Extremely expensive and for the cost, crackers are not what I was hoping for, they are very very solid and hard to eat. Would have liked to have known that these are more than crisp, they are brick hard. Anyone with dentures should not order these...."
5,Heavenly,My favorite Jazz record. It often brings tears to my eyes while listening to it on my PC during the early hours between 6 and 8 before my collegues begin to turn up at work. I sigh and put aside my headphones - already looking forward to tomorrow's early hours!
5,Rock Solid,"I absolutely agree with the other 5 star reviews here: This is a fabulous CD that, while not Chick Corea or Gonzalo Rubalcaba (and doesn't try or pretend to be), is rock solid. Broadbent swings hard, uses space, is technically crisp, demonstrates wit and intellect, and takes every melody on an adventure. Highly recommended."
1,"Not what it seems, BORING","When I picked this book up I thought I would get a nice history of Gotti. That was true to some extent but the majority of the book was devoted to the trials. If you are a lawyer or someone who is interested in that sort of thing then this book is for you. If you want a good read then pick up the Capeci book on Gotti,that is top of the line! You can also read this if you are having problems sleeping...."
3,Too many personal opinions laced into the book,"The author adds too much personal opinion into the text. If you're looking for straight facts, all the personal opinions can be really annoying to sort through. Because of the unprofessional insertions, I wouldn't recommend it for a research project; which is unfortunate because the book had some decent facts mixed in between the author's delusional ego."
1,The author Jerry Capeci and his book,"The book is a one sided story told by a man who is ""obsessed"" with John Gotti. Full of news reports that could be fact or fiction. This author has made a ton of money off the Gotti name and continues to do so. He will not let go, we know $$$ motivates him, we know the name GOTTI sells/promotes his web site, articles, and books, but could there be more to the relentless vendetta he has against JOHN GOTTI or is it in Italians themsleves. A dirty little secret?? The rumor is Jerry Capeci uses a pen name, and in fact he is of ""irish"" ethincity by birth. Could he have a hiddin agenda which motivates his writings of Italian Americans negative light????? Let us know Mr.Capeci!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,End of an Era [Blu-ray],"I have owned the DVD for a couple of years and watched it about a dozen times. I thought I would try the Blu-ray version. WOW! The video on the Blu-ray is so much better then the DVD. The DVD looks washed out, the blacks levels are gray, and the colors lack intensity. On the Blu-ray the blacks are black, the colors have full saturation and the level of details is astounding! When I watched the Blu-ray last night, I felt like I was watching the concert for the first time!If you have the DVD, buy the Blu-ray, the upgrade is worth it. If you like Nightwish, buy the Blu-ray. If you like Metal but have never heard of Nightwish, buy the Blu-ray. Nothing else matters."
5,A nightwish come true,"It was definitely an ""End of a Era"" with the loss of Tarja Turunen but it is not the end of Nightwish! It is easy for me to say the Tuomas Holopainen is one of the best if not the best new composers of our time. The music envelopes all of your senses and at time touches your soul, and when you add Emppu(guitar), Jukka(drums) and Marco(base)who are all masters of thier craft they help breath life into Holopainen's visions.It is very sad that this is the Final performance for Tarja but it is defiantly one to revisit again and again. Thank you Tarja for this fantastic show and we will miss you! ""STUNNING"" ""Exquisite"" and well worth your investment. May all our ""Nightwishes"" come true."
1,Worst Gift Ever,"There's really nothing to like about Nightwish, unless you're a teenager trying to fool your parents into seeing how cultured you are or a parent trying to show your kids how cool you are for listening to ""metal."" Everything here has been done before by better metal bands and/or orchestras alike. They even fail at pandering to the Pink Floyd fan base by covering a song from easily the worst album ever released with the Floyd name on it. Those who call this ""edgy"" or ""original"" or even ""powerful"" are grossly out of touch with the metal scene. Nightwish is the musical equivalent of a snuggy with a skull on it: soft and not to be taken seriously."
4,Nightwish spectacular,Nightwish and Tarja Turunen! What a combo. My first Nightwish DVD. Great video. Didn't care for the sound. I think the recording quality was OK but the concert hall venue seems to have distorted the sound when compared to the actual CD recordings.
2,Blu-ray HD = 720P,"This is a very distinguished concert, we would like to have a perfect recordthe video only 720P is not good,I holp have 1080P"
5,Great,"this was on time and nicely packaged, My wife very much enjoyed her Christmas present. WWWWoooooooo HHHHoooooogotta add a few more words to reviews?"
2,MUSIC IS GREAT VIDEO DID NOT WORK IT MAY BE PAL,"WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE MUSIC IS GREAT, THE DVD WON'T PLAY THIS SUCKS BIG TIME...IT COULD BE REGENT 2 PAL WE USE ZONE 1 NTSC...............I ALREADY OWN MOST OF THE MUSIC. PLUS IT WAS MADE 2003. THIS IS A BIG RIPOFF BECAUSE. YOU JUST GET THE MUSIC. VIDEO WILL NOT PLAY. NIGHTWISH IS A SUPER BAND THEY SOUND GREAT AND THE LEAD SINGER HAS A GREAT VOICE. I JUST LOVE THEM. ONE OF THE BEST BANDS ON EARTH. BUT U CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO. I AM NOT GOING TO RETURN THE CDS BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD.HOPE THIS HELPS YOU."
4,Great DVD Shooting - Poor Quality,Nightwish give us once more an example of their great talent either in composing or generally creating songs that can really touch someone's feelings and move his fantasy.It is a DVD that a fan of NIGHTWISH must have in his library.On the contrary someone can easily notice the poor quality of the image of the DVD. To make matters worse it cannot be produced by Windows Media Player or Vlc. Only produced by nero show time or a home DVD player.The sound is at least very good indeed.
3,Not what I was expecting.,"I really like Nightwish, but this is not what I expected. You could tell that there is quite of bit of lip synching at least in the beginning of most of the songs. Also, some of the music itself was pre-recorded. I was hoping for more of an orchestral accompaniment or at least something to differentiate the music from a studio recording."
2,Only 720p,"I was very disappointed to discover that the BluRay is only 720p.It looks like dvd quality. Nightwish: End of an Era depicts an amazing performance of Nightwish's greatest songs.I'd suggest just going for the DVD, but the performance is worth experiencing."
4,Hilarious,"Don't listen to the haters! This movie is very funny,Bow wow and Brandon T. Jackson are very funny togetherthe rest of the cast is great. please,before you judge ""a book by it's cover"" watch the movie with an open mind,my friends and i laughed the whole time,I personally think that bow wow is becoming a pretty good actor,he has good chemistry with the whole cast. I just hope that this movie will become a cult classic like ""Friday"". so just watch it laugh and enjoy."
1,where are the subtitles?,We had to turn off this movie about 15 min. into it. We could not understand the dialogue. The dialogue was so fast and seemed in a foreign language to me.
3,Cute Movie,"This movie wasn't ""roll on the floor"" funny, but it wasn't ""stab me in my eyes"" boring either. It was a cute predictable comedy. Glad I didn't go to the theater to see it, but enjoyed it on a boring Saturday night at home."
3,Not What I Expected,"I didn't buy the DVD, but I saw it in the movies, and to me it was a waste of money! The action was slow and I almost fell alseep. Maybe the DVD is cheaper now and you might enjoy it, but I didn't. Sorry, Bow-Wow, but I still love you!"
4,All Star Cast,Maybe it's just me but I liked this movie. It was better than i thought and It was funny. It's not the best comedy of all time but it definitely one you can enjoy with the family.
2,it stinks,movie was not as i thought it would be.The subject was good the actors were not that great.i want my money back.
5,Lottery Ticket Review,This was an excellent movie! It had me laughing and was entertaining all of the way through! I would recommend it to anyone!
3,lottery ticket,this movie was okay if one of my son's come to get it i won't be mad!!! most of the time i will fuss but not over this one
3,Good for cheap laughs!,"I'm sure it will never be a classic, but it was good enough for me to watch and laugh during the mid-week when nothing was on TV that I wanted to see. Like many other movies I have watched, I did find myself asking where the heck are the cops (I guess that's becasue it wasn't a cops an robber movie). Lottery Ticket does have a feel good ending."
5,Lottery Ticket,It's a fun movie with lots of twists and turns in it. Bow Wow and Ice Cube are winners in this comedy. Fun for the whole family!
4,I couldn't put it down!,"I just bought this book today and have yet to cook from it (hence holding off on the 5th star) but this is what I was looking for in a South American cookbook. While others may give a brief intro about a dish, Ms. Kijac gives several pages of history and background that really helps one understand this cuisine. The book is so well-researched that one can see it was truly a labor of love. The food glossary is a big bonus! My only criticism is that each recipe is not associated with its country of origin."
5,The South American Kitchen,"This book was recommended by the owner of the Zuleta Hacienda in the Ecuadoran Andes. He said that is a true representation of South American food, the best he knows of.The recipes are easy to follow and so far, v. good. I'd highly recommend the book for foodies!"
3,ONE OF MY FAVORITE GROUPS DOES IT AGAIN!,"GUS GUS IS ONE OF THOSE GROUPS THAT I INSTANTLY BUY REGARDLESS IF I'VE HEARD IT OR NOT...THE LIVE MIX OF DANCE YOU DOWN IS A PERFECT SET OPENER IN THOSE DARK DINGY SWEATY CLUBS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S SOMA NIGHTLIFE DISTRICT...DARREN EMERSON'S MIX OF DAVID IS GOOD FUNKY HOUSE, BUT THE DANCE YOU DOWN LIVE MIX IS WHY THIS DOES IT FOR ME..."
5,Absolutely Wonderfull inspiration deep minded film,This film was very well put together and touched upon various aspects in life. Movie deepens your awareness and consciousness. Very powerful and inspiration. Would recommended to the open/serene minded person. Actually one of my favorite is not favorite film.
4,Indictment is excellent,"Indictment: The McMartin Trial is an engrossing and moving portrayal of the horrrible injustice that was done to the McMartin family by an overzealous L.A. district attorney's office. After a child-abuse complaint was lodged in 1983, the events were set in motion. The 7-year court process resulted in NO convictions. While child-welfare advocates (or fanatics) aren't likely to agree, this is a great docu-drama by producer Abby Mann. Very well-acted and directed this is one HBO original that actually lived up to the hype."
2,They told the wrong story,"I grew up in Manhattan Beach in the 80's. Luckily for me, I went to a different pre-school. I grew up with bumper stickers reading, ""I believe the children.""This movie offends me simply because they only told one side of the story, and because they skewed it so much. I was horrified to see the defendants portrayed as victims, and the children and parents portrayed as fools, when I knew the opposite to be true. Parents are not fools. They know when their kids are lying. I helieve the children.Other reviewers claim this is a true story. I beg any viewer to take it with a grain of salt-- this is the ""true"" story as told by the defendants. Ask any parent or child involved, and you'll hear a completely different story."
4,justice system out of control,"Unlike so many others, my family has personal knowledge of false accusations of child abuse. The techniques used in this trial were the same as those used in the case our family endured. Children were interviewed numerous times by numerous people (including inexperienced and biased interviewers) for over a year. Evidence in favor of the defense was withheld, the prosecutor lied about witnesses, the judge, although biased refused to step down and the defense attorney was incompetent. Publicity about the case branded the defendant guilty before he was even arrested. I know wrongful accusation of child abuse can and do happen!"
3,A comment by a reader,"I consulted the unabridged Oxford German English Dictionary and found only Schwindelpreis(exorbitant price). That is, the adjective schwindelhaft never appears alone to mean ""exorbitant"" anyway."
3,"The price is right, but the content is.......","I bought a copy of this dictionary and to my great disappointment, there are a number of errors which obviously are not typos. Check the word ""exorbitant"" on the English-German side and you will see the translation, ""schwindelhaft"", which actually means bogus, or fraudulent. This is only the tip of the iceberg.There may be a lot of similar mistakes we haven't found yet."
3,batteries don't last,"This battery is hard to find and very expensive. I love my camera but these batteries don't last (flaw in camera design). Buying on here, I purchased 2 for much less than the price of one (when I could find it)."
4,replacement oem battery for casio exilim s770,"I have had this battery for two weeks now and it performs like the original that came with the camera. I had no idea that it was going to be so hard to find an oem battery for this camera. The original died after three years. There are others that appear to be the same but the information on the battery is in Japanese. Undecided if I should purchase a spare just in case, or take a chance and order one of the ones with the Japanese writing. Over all I am happy with the purchase."
1,NP 20 lithium battery,"this was a total waste of time. I bought the battery to replace one which had was dead and the new one was just as dead as the old one,. I was ripped off because the battery sent was dead. I checked the charge with a reading monitor and after it was charged it was dead as a door knob. Be careful about someone offering you a battery because probably the only reason they are selling it is because it was dead.One star rating only because I could not do zero stars.WAS RIPPED OFF"
1,Bad Battery,"I received this camera as a gift from my niece. The battery went dead and will not charge. The charger blinks on and off indicating this. Apparently, there is a ""flaw"" in the battery. My niece owns the same camera, called the company and was sent a new battery - no charge. Her friend also had the same issue with her battery. I am now having the same problem. Casio, do you THINK MAYBE there is a problem with these batteries??? I emailed Casio tonite and will keep emailing them until I receive an answer. I am looking at getting a free replacement, otherwise, I am switching to another company. Lots of choices out there."
1,Dies after a while,"I've purchased a casio camera and it comes with this battery. I tried to charge my camera after not using it for a few months, and it didn't work. I called casio tech support and they just told me to buy a new battery."
4,"""Replacement"" batteries don't fit as well in my camera","I've tried the Duracell DR9611 in my Casio EX-Z4. They work great, BUT, they don't pop out as designed. Only the Casio NP20 will pop out. I don't want to continue to risk damaging my camera by buying the less expensive ""replacement"" batteries-I'll stick with the original. Thanks!"
1,Battery would not charge - thanks J.E.,"My battery was fully discharged too, and all the charger would do is show the blinking light. I tried taking it out and back in to the charger several times, but still no luck.Many thanks to J.E. for his description of using a 9 V battery with wires to the NP-20 terminals. I did this for 30 seconds as he suggested, and when I put it into the charger, sure enough it started charging. In less than an hour it was fully charged. I put it back into the camera, and it is working fine now.I had a pair of wires that used for something years ago that had soldered alligator clips to each end. That made it very easy to attach to the 9 V battery, and then just held the other ends to the camera battery.A GREAT idea!I'll never get another camera that does not take regular AA or rechargeable AA batteries."
2,Casio NP-20 is not OEM,The picture that represented this product is incorrect! I paid more than I should have because I thought I was getting an original equipment battery. What I received was a generic battery that I could have purchased for half the price. BUYER BEWARE!
5,Casio NP- 20 Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery,I bought this Casio NP- 20 Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery to replace the one that came with my Casio Exilim camera. The original battery was no longer able to hold a charge. I have been very happy with this battery so far.
1,casio np-20 battery,"Bought this rechargeable battery for a Casio camera. We've recharged it 2x and it still doesn't hold a charge. Threw out the shipping papers, figuring it was new! Looks like I wasted 17.00, maybe they're better from a different source. This one is a dud!"
3,Not what I expected,"When I got the product that I ordered, it was not the right kind as was pictured on Amazon or on my receipt. I did receive it in a timely manner but, as it was not what I ordered, it did me no good. I did email the seller and was very happy to know that they refunded my full money order, shipping as well, in a timely matter so I could go order another, proper battery. Although the product was not what I ordered, I had a pleasant time ordering from this seller and would order from them again due to the fact of their customer service and knowing that if they do send me the wrong product, they will fix the problem in one way or another."
2,Could be Better,"My original Casio battery died after about 13 months. I'd say that's pretty convenient timing on Casio's part, since my warranty was for 1 year. I tried both of the methods for ""jump-starting"" it I read about here: repeatedly putting the battery on the charger just until the red light turns on, then removing it, as well as using the 9 volt battery. I couldn't get either of those methods to work, so I just bought a new from Amazon. I did notice that my orignal battery is 700mAh, and this one's only 630, but I can deal with that."
3,Casio NP-20 Rechargeable Li Ion Digital Camera Battery,"Haven't actually used the new battery - purchased as a spare. Hope it is better that the original battery supplied with the camera (Exilim). Battery has a sporadic performance history, sometimes failing to recharge. Rating 3 stars based on product history since it has yet to be used. Would rate seller with 5 stars as the product arrived ahead of schedule using the Free Shipping option."
1,Battery is fine - charger was defective,"I ordered this ion battery as a replacement for the one in my husband's new Casio EX-Z75 camera because the one that came with the camera wouldn't charge. The new battery didn't charge either. Based on two phone calls to Casio, we had to go with the unbelievable assumption that both batteries were bad. In desperation, I purchased an inexpensive replacement battery (not Casio brand), and on the slim chance that the charger that came with the camera was in some way defective, I also ordered an inexpensive car/home charger with good reviews. LO AND BEHOLD, batteries 2 and 3 charged and work perfectly. Now I'm kicking myself for throwing the original battery away, since there was probably nothing wrong with it. Moral of the story: make sure your charger is working properly before you get mad at the battery."
5,it's a battery,"the great thing is that it can be recharged, that is such a revolution in technology! they should send these to the moon and mars! I'll bet Mitt Romney has one of those, although he often forgets to charge it."
1,How to fix your NP-20,"My NP-20 would not charge. The problem is that battery charge becomes so low that the charger will not recognize the battery and the red light on the charger will blink without charging. To fix the problem you need to jump start the NP-20 battery. Connect two D-cell flashlight batteries together. Then connect a wire from the (+) on the D-cell batteries to the (+) on the NP-20. Then connect the (-) on the D-cell batteries to the (-) on the NP-20.Hold the connection for about 10 seconds. Then put your NP-20 in the charger. If the red light remains on, your problems are solved. Charge the NP-20 in the charger for 90 minutes then place it in the camera. You should be all set...Hope this helps, Glenn.."
2,OK until they fail - (frequently),"I'm on my third ""genuine"" Casio battery in one year. The $5 generic batteries seem to work just as good. Contact Casio for warranty first- they'll send out a new battery and acknowledge that they frequently fail"
1,Casio NP-20 Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery,"Very disappointing.Battery was no good, could not take a charge. I sent an e-mail stating the facts and was not even afforded the courtesy of a reply.Bad deal...which only the consumer pays!Carlos G. SANTOS"
5,Just what I needed,This battery was perfect and shipped to me in great timing. The old one stopped working because my case had a magnet on it so a new one was much needed! I bought it from a different seller and paid like 10 for it...great deal!
5,The best for your Casio,This is the best batery for your casi.... do not try anything else.... you will regreat.
1,This one didn't work,I bought the Casio Digital camera because they come with the longest lasting batteries of all. The extra battery ordered from this site did NOT work at all. It would not charge even after 24 hours. It would not turn on the camera. I got a refund from Amazon but Adorama never emailed a return label so I paid about $12 for shipping coming and going. I'm afraid to try again. Wish there was another source for real Casio batteries.
1,casio battery,"Hello, I'm not satisfied with this purchase because I bougth an original casio battery and recieved a similar one .... Seller should have asked if I wanted it istead of sending . I do not recomend buying from this seller."
3,Can't really say,I meant to order the NP-60 and clicked on the NP-20 by mistake. I have no idea how the product works since it won't fit in my camera. I am hoping the seller may be interested in exchanging for the correct item.
3,Not Packed Well - Dishes Were Broken,"BIA Cordon Bleu Lyon Collection 2-Quart Round Covered Casserole, WhiteI ordered two of these casserole dishes on Amazon Prime, but was so disappointed when they arrived in pieces. Seems they were only packed with some air bags around the sides. It's too bad because cooking with porcelain gives nice results. Unfortunately, I have to return them."
2,it could have been better,the way the book was written to lay your life and future out the way they did is such in poor taste i myself am very displeased with this book. you should really get your prioritys striaght befoe bad mouthing and resenting someone who you may have crossed paths with one time in your life.
3,A great accessory!,An awesome accessory for anyone who is a fan of the series and thinks the transmutation circle is one the best spell casting circles in anime.
5,what a wonderful book!,"As a avid reader, this is one on the best books I have read all year! I could not put it down! The customs and traditions of the characters are unbelievable! The story kept me so close that I would feel my heart racing! I whole heartly recommend this book."
4,From the point of view of a boy... Then a man...,"This is actually the diary of Adrian Mole, an awkward teenager, who lived the life of a normal teenager. He had a crush on a pretty girl, hated his dog sometimes, had parents who squabble now and then... The diary was written from the view of Adrian Mole. You could see that the writing style change as he grew and matured. I really admired how Sue Townsend can see things from the view of a young boy and a young man. Nice work! Pretty funny too!"
3,"30"" neon blue tube is burned out","Goodmorning, Im sorry to say that my 30"" blue neon tube is burned out and i would really like a replacement i have had neon lights under my truck for about eight years and have only replaced the transformer and one tube i am glad i bought the gold because it can be replaced with no charge .Please send a replacement as soon as possible and i enjoy the service i have gotten through Amazon .com. Thanks very much Larry...................."
5,Swinging doesn't get much better,"This record features some of the finest charts Hefti wrote for the Basie band, extremely well played by an established band. If you've heard the Basie recordings of these charts (as I have) you will notice some stark stylistic differences. But these interpretations compare very well with the Basie records, and the soloists are top-notch. Highly recommended."
3,Not that special to me(David's Son),"These songs seem boring to my son's high school jazz band. Essentially, they ruined ""Lil' Darlin"", which used to be one of my fsvorites till I realized it was moapy and sappy to no end."
3,"Beautiful illustrations, primary sources, and a brief narrative","While I am not enamored of the writing style of the author--and I imagine the translation into English was uneven--the little book makes up for it with very nice, colorful illustrations from Mongol and central Asian art, and with a helpful set of primary source readings at the end of the book. No, it's not going to be authoritative as a history, and some phrases are awkward (though mostly just old-fashioned), if you can find it at a used bookstore, it's worth picking up, and using for the things it does well. It works best as a historical art book interspersed with history."
2,Yuck.,"This is just more proof that Mark Waid doesn't understand Captain America. The story is incredibly boring, overly wordy, and has a stupid ending. I bought it because I was a big fan of Waid's stuff, but this sure didn't read like a Waid story. If you want good Waid, go buy Kingdom Come and Flash. Forget this schlock."
2,After a busy day chasing your prey across the savanna...,"and biting into them with your bare teeth, you might want take time out buy and admire this bumpersticker. OTOH, if you're not eating lions and tigers and sharks, chances are you're not at the top of the food chain. And whoever thinks it's best for a human to be at the top of the food chain is not a cardiologist.But I give this sticker an extra star for being mildly amusing."
3,Airplane Reunion,"In 1989 the most famous line-up of the Jefferson Airplane reformed to cash in on the 60's revitalization. The result was a solid, but not spectacular effort. ""Planes"" is a great song and the best on the album. It holds up to most anything else the band has recorded. It is the only song that rises to a truly great level. ""Summer Of Love"" is a good track that reminisces about the band's glory days and ""Madeline Street"", ""Freedom"" and ""Solidarity"" are solid efforts. ""True Love"" was written by David Paich & Steve Porcaro from Toto and the song sounds like a Toto reject."
1,Horrid,"I am a big fan of the Airplane. All I can say is that this album was a major disappointment in 1989. Listening to it again now, it sounds even worse to my ears. It is horrid. I never liked Starship after the first album or two but amazingly, pretty much anything that band did tops this one. The live shows were good but they should have left it at that."
4,"Passable, but not great","Well, I've heard worse, but I've heard better. It was kind of sad to hear what had become of this band. Slick was apparently still recovering from her '80's pop romp with that abomination Starship, and you can hear it, though ""Common Market Madrigal"" is great, and ""Panda"" will bring a lump to your throat if you have any sympathy for the plight of panda bears. Kantner is, as always, excellent. ""Madeleine Street"" is a great old style bluesy tune with Slick playing great piano. And we can always rely on Kaukonen's bluesy brand of folk to make it worth your time. And Balin. Oh the poor guy. His song ""Summer of Love"" had potential to be great, but the tacky '80's pop ballad arrangement kills it. The record should have been called ""Airship,"" just because it sounds too much Starship trying to mimic Jefferson Airplane. So in short, you might like it, you might not. I'm still torn years later."
3,a reunion cd,This was a reunion cd and it's ok. The sound is similiar to starship and other songs sound more like the 1970's period of jeff starship a great era for this outfit in imo. Anyways I love the 'airplanes' song the best on here but other songs are weaker by far. But all in all 1989 was lucky to have some new airplane music as in fact grace slick would hang it up and become a good painter after this one.
1,Used CD,The CD that I bought thru 'goHastins' via amazon.com was scratched and it skips. The CD is unplayable. Do they offer refunds? Or should I just throw it away?
3,As usual Jorma (Kaukonen) saves the situation,"As I said in the title of the rewiew, Jorma made this album acceptable.Infact in the early 70's, when Grace was into drugs, and the Airplane should do a concert, Jorma (and his long-time partner and bass genious Jack Cassady) played entertaining the audience, while Grace was recovering.This time they don't have to wait Grace, but they have to make her (and Paul Kantner and Marty Balin's) orrible songs acceptable, soloing and supporting melodically them.And, of course he wrote some beutiful songs, althought demaged by the horrible Jefferson Airplane arrangement.In fact if you ear the Hot Tuna (or Jorma's solo) versions of the songs ""Ice age"" or ""Too many years"" you'll realize that Hot Tuna as been the creative and indistructible basis in 60's, 70's, and in 90's too."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","Disguised as something of a greatest hits package, this turns out to be a collection of live songs from the some of the earliest gigs Jefferson Airplane played with Grace Slick. It's interesting, but the versions of Somebody to Love and 3/5ths of a mile in ten seconds are dissapointing. On the first disc, White Rabbit is the only won worth hearing. On the second, after a poor version of 3/5ths of a mile, the set redeems itself a bit with some solid covers, but they end up sounding a bit like arena rock."
5,"Julia Roberts is laughter, tears and great movies!","Julia Roberts gives out the best of her acting in both of this movies. On ""My best friend's wedding"", her overwhelming acting goes far beyond Cameron Diaz's innoncent looking, uptown girl beauty. She is ambitious, hilarious and beautiful.On Stepmom she reaches out and does not fade next to great actress Sussan Sarandon. Both actresses give the audience laughs and tears. An overall great movie."
3,Two great films put together for on great afternoon!,"This two films are different in their context, but bond together perfectly to make a great collection. Stepmom is a great, tear shedding film that will open the viewer's heart. My Best Friend's Wedding is full of laughter and gives us a great Julia Roberts and a gorgeaus Cameron Diaz"
2,Cheap but worth it,"I only use it maybe 20 times a year , if you need a set like this for every day drop the money on sk or snap on , the case fell apart in six months, buy a heavy duty bag if you purchase"
5,Big hit for Christmas,"This was a big hit for Christmas. Superman is well made, sturdy, and yet snuggly. Superman has been all around the house and property saving damsels in distress. So far, no pulls, rips, or tears. The product feels like it will last for a long time."
4,Sealy Posturpedic Luxury 300-Thread Count Egyptian Cotton Top Mattress Pad,Great proguct. Nice and soft but with support. Great fit to bed.
3,Sealy Luxury Mattress pad,"The top of this mattress pad is, indeed, luxurious. However, the sides are, as Mike Myers' Scotsman would say, ""Krrrap"". You must be extremely careful and gentle putting this on your bed. The material is paper-like and very easy to pierce. Additionally, do not dry this in your dryer at a heat higher than low or the sides will melt."
2,If you must have a cover... any cover... this one will do,"Very thin, not very soft. Was not worth it to me. I have since returned it to Amazon."
4,Crush something today,"This is an excellent value and will be an excellent addition to any kitchen. This is as small as I would ever want a mortar, but it is a good size for most jobs."
5,good tool,"We use this to grind fresh herbs in our kitchen. It is especially useful for ""muddling"" herbs for cocktails. I don't know how anyone could make a perfect mojito without a mortar and pestle. It washes up very well."
2,Extremely fragile,"Worked well for a few uses, but a single drop of the pestle into the mortar punched a section out."
3,Cute,"This mortar, is cute, I mean small cute, it is possible to grind ingredients in batches, but for real functionality the next size up would probably work better.The surfaces are not too coarse or smooth, and seem to provide the grinding action necessary, the pestle would benefit from a wood handle.For the price, a good buy."
5,"Loved it, used it to grind hot peppers!","I absolutely loved the BIA Cordon Bleu Mortar and Pestle set. I've just received it, but of course went straight to using it. It's very sturdy and does it's job well. I've also written a review on my site with pictures. [...]I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a Mortar and Pestle that's well build, does it's job, doesn't discolor and won't break your bank!"
5,Works Great!,This mortar and pestle works the best of any I've used. It's the perfect size and grinds herbs and seeds efficiently.
1,Cheaply Made,I used this mortar and pestle only a few times before the bottom cracked and it became useless. This pestle is too smooth and lightweight to be useful.
2,Cute but not practical,I have a wooden mortar and pestle that I use to make garlic paste and grind other spices. I though this one could to the same but is not like the wood one at all. This mortar seems very sooth and things just slide around too much. The pestle is not big enough to keep things from sliding around.
4,it works,"it works well, but the pestle could be a bit larger and formed a bit better. other than that, i have no complaints."
3,A nice little mortar and pestle,"It works alright, but I find that I have to use a lot of pressure to grind herbs. It's not all that ergo, but good for the price. It also cleans up very easily."
2,bottom fell out,"I liked this mortar and pestle and it worked great to crush pills. That is- until the bottom of the mortar just fell out one morning while I was using it. It was never dropped and did not have a chip or crack in it. I contacted Amazon (the seller) and they said it was past the point where they could return/exchange it. ALso the manufacturer would not discuss an exchange either.I think that there is something wrong with a product when the it completely splits in half for no reason.There are other, less expensive versions out there. I'm going to try one of those. I would not buy this brand again."
3,Wrong Title,"This book should be called ""Improve Your Premiere 6.5 Skills In 24 Hours"". It isn't for a beginner. I'm sure I will find it handy in the future, and it seems to be a good book, but the title is misleading."
4,The Ninth Texas Cavalry,"There's nothing I appreciate more is a historical work where the author has consulted numerous often obscure primary sources in order to construct a never before written history. All Afire to Fight is one such work, and I have to say I have really enjoyed reading this book and learning about the Ninth Texas Cavalry--not to mention the military activities in the theater of the war where they were active, about which I am not that familiar at the moment. I found the narrative to be excellently written for the most part, although there were a few awkward spots. The one real detracting aspect of the book was the lack of a roster. In my opinion, no regimental history should be without one (the more detailed the better!) provided the information is extant."
5,great read,"amazing what people before us have gone through.politics was alive and well (or sick ) then even as now.strange to realize how little some things change.the young boys,full of ideal,left texas only to find unbelievable hardship and often neglect by their superiors.yet they became fierce fighting warriors that,through their resourcefulness,acquitted themselves with honor during many battles.I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in this book and recommend it to all who are interested in this period of the history of our nation."
1,"A Great Title, but does not Deliver the Goods","I write as an economist who works in behavioral ecology in general, and on the analytical modeling and empirical testing of theories of reciprocity in particular. From my point of view, the book leaves much to be desired.I do not have the expertise to comment on the author's neuroscientific arguments. Whatever their value, his applications to economics and the other social sciences are highly general and superficial, consisting of quoting some authorities from the past and interspersing one or two current references on a given topic. The link between neuroscience and behavioral ecology is pure hand-waving."
2,Disappointing,"The novel starts well enough, but then it meanders for about a hundred pages. Again and again the writer mulls over the suspects without coming to any conclusion. One almost senses that space is being filled for the publisher, without the plot moving forward a single inch.But that is tolerable, perhaps. What is not tolerable is the murderer confessing in detail (while a tape recorder is running) and explaining just how the killing took place and why the crime was necessary--and then committing suicide. Baloney! It has been done far too many times. Surely readers are sick of this by now. The evidence here against the killer is flimsy at best, certainly not strong enough to stand up in court if the accused has a decent lawyer. All the murderer has to do is deny, deny, deny. The easy way out of this for the writer? Those old stand-bys, confession and suicide. Surely there has to be some alternative to this facile denouement."
2,Couldn't care about the characters or the story,"Henrie O poses as the aunt of a dear friend's nephew in order to investigate the murder of the man's wife.The nephew was such a spineless sleazeball that I had no sympathy for or interest in Henrie's detecting. He manipulated her into posing as his aunt and outright lied whenever he could. Hart does a good job portraying him, but his whining and evasions left me cold. I couldn't care about the story and quit about halfway through."
3,Rather tedious to read,"I have read Caroyln Hart's other series (Death on Demand) and decided to try this one. This is NOT as good as the other series. The plot of slow, the character boring...and its all very one-person. Its just Henrie O solving her crime. There isn't the depth of secondary characters that add life to a mystery (like there is in Death on Demand). Most of the characters are annoying and not likeable as well. Not a recommended read...a much better read is one of her Death on Demand series with Annie."
5,Great book with lots of follow up references for the topic,"This book arrived on time and in advertised condition and the contents were fascinating. Anyone interested in just what evidence there is for meteor impact, global heating, or any of the other proposed causes of mass extinctions will find this book well researched and well written. I recommend it to anyone interested in how earth geology may be shown to be closer to that of our neighboring planets (by the Curiosity Mars Rover)than has been up-to-now appreciated. Buy it!"
5,Excellent - Must Read - For Any Student of Hitting,"Charley Lau, Jr. has surpassed his father in this work. This book is an excellent, must read for any student of hitting. It is an easy to read and understand work. Although I have not applied the theory of this work yet, I firmly belive in many of the concepts contained therein."
3,Torn,"I'm torn on how to feel about this book! Charley Lau Sr was a revolutionary when he applied his principles to hitting and it's tough to argue with the outcomes, especially his the results of his star pupil, George Brett. I don't feel that Lau Jr adds much to the Linear Hitting System that his father started and did not get a lot of new information from this book.The best books to begin your hitting journey are Ted Williams: The Science of Hitting and Jim Lefebvre: The Making of a Hitter. From there, Jim Cevallos: Positional Hitting adds the best update to rotational hitting."
4,Lau's Laws,"While the debate on Linear vs rotational hitters rages on, the basics of Lau's Laws still hold true. While this book by Lau Jr. is sometimes a little too self congratulatory, the advice is sound and easily understood by non-experts who just want to improve or help their Little League team hit better. Like must instructional books, if you pick up one or two helpful tips and ignore some others, the read is worthwhile."
2,The Only Bad Thing About This Book Is The Cheater On The Cover.,"Well done. A great overview of the science of hitting. I do have a problem with the cheater on the cover. I can't stand to look at this lying cheat. I'd be willing to bet that the sales of this book would increase if it had a real hero like Aaron, Musial, Mays, Mantle, Ruth or Williams on the cover."
3,Water Marked,"This was a selection by a Book Club member. The consensus thought the book was very difficult to get into. No one completed the book. It was the slowest book I've ever tried to read. None of the characters were developed in a manner which would make for enjoyable reading. I went to the end of the book after 6 days of reading and then only getting through Chapt 6. The idea was good but should have been presented differently. Why not develop the characters relationships for example tell more about Sunday' experiences in Chicago and with her husband, how they got together. More details about Delta and her male relationships. Information about Mercury's early childhood. This book did not hold the interest of any of our 11 Book Club members."
3,Slow beginning but worth the wait,"I came close to putting this book down because it was so slow. I felt as though I didn't really know the main characters; in fact, the secondary characters came across as more familiar and believable than the sisters. However, I kept reading out of respect for Ms. Lee's first novel. I was suprised towards the end of the book at how interested I'd become. The passages on Reed and his reflections of his relationship with Sunday were breathtaking. Superb insight and writing! I especially loved the last sentence in the novel. If only the beginning grabbed me as much as the end, for it is the end that gets you ""in the belly"", so to speak."
3,Dry This One Out,"Love the way most of this is written, love the language and the characters...but the whole story dragged a bit. It started out in superb fashion, drifted around in the middle and tried to solve all the world's problems in the last few pages.The writer has SO much talent, but the story told on these pages doesn't live up to that talent fully. I think it could have either used another 100 pages or so to develop more fully, or she could have taken out the middle 50 pages and made it a sweeter novella."
4,Best than Disney Movies,"If you want a Buzz Lightyear for you, now you can have it with this incredible game. The graphics are cool and so is the gameplay. You can interact with all the caracter of the movie (like Mr. Potato Head). This game is cool and its very charged of fun. Go and get it."
2,Dissappointed,"I ordered the pillow because it seemed to be a good price for the name. Unfortunately, after receiving it, I was extremely disappointed with it, and returned it. The size is nice, but the quality of the pillow is similar to one sold at a big store in most cities for about half the price. And, the pillow is not temperature-sensitive. The pillow did not become more firm when it was cold, as would a real temperature-sensitive visco-elastic pillow. This pillow cannot even be compared to the famous brand with lots of informercials. It feels almost like regular foam with the exception of a slight pause when returning to original shape. If you're looking for a pillow that responds to temperature, and has good support, then this is probably not the right pillow. You get what you pay for, and there's a reason why some pillows cost near a hundred dollars."
1,Just an ordinary foam pillow,"I should have paid attention to some of the other reviewers' comments. This is not anything at all like the high-end ""memory foam"" pillows. It's an ordinary foam rubber pillow. If you're looking for an ordinary foam rubber pillow, it may very well be a nice one ... but it wasn't what I was expecting from the description and the photos."
5,one of the best cd's i ever bought,"This is a wonderful review of American Music. I have not come in contact with anything that approaches it. it is worth almost any price (within reason) that you pay to have it. From it, you can go to hundreds of different performers to get any exellent introduction to this country's music since 1893. I would hate to see something like this go out of print. it is more than music, it is an historical statement and altogether very, very rewarding listening experience. i only had one question. i have never been able to figure out what ""Mojo"" means from the title. If anyone knows please advise."
4,Soft Jazz Makes a Statement,"I own a copy of the Amelia CD. Trent Antony and Wayne McGraw are putting forth some good music here. What makes it stand out is the blending of soft jazz with pop/rock progressions. It is original music that will capture your attention for sure. Just imagine putting on a jazz CD, but what comes out is something colored with touches of Eric Claption, rock guitar, and a drummer not afraid to write drum scores with feel and originality. There are a few songs that are like movie soundtracks or marching bands! My favorite is This Way East and the haunting Amelia. Good buy. Support this group."
1,Awful,"This is a terrible book, but unfortunately you probably won't have much choice in whether or not to use it if it is required for your course. I agree with the other reviewer that the companion softbound supplement is far more useful in understanding the concepts presented. If you can find that or the Bar review multistate materials, you'll learn far more of the structure of criminal law than you will from this book. This is a philosophy text.If Dressler spent half as much time explaining topics as he does making snide political comments, this book would be far superior.Luckily, Criminal Law is just one semester and the Bar review materials generally make up for the many shortcomings of this ridiculous text."
5,"Read, you must!","I absolutely loved this book. It had a great message. I was reading it for a school book report. We had to write our own review too!This book has excitement, racism, a ghost story, and even a luau! The main character is Frannie Driscoll. She is 13 (like me!) She has three best friends. Kelly, who loves horses, Margot, who thinks she's French, and Nancy, who acts like a mom. Frannie meets a new friend Celeste , who is black. Other people look down upon her. Frannie looks up upon her. Frannie sets a good example for the rest of her friends.That's what I love about this book. Frannie shows tolerance and shows that it doesn't hurt to have a black friend. In this book there are mean examples of racism and since it's set in the 60's, no one thinks it's wrong. Well I think you'll enjoy this book. I know I did.Oh, by the way, the starplace is an old rocket ship slide that was apart of a playground that was taken down for haunted purposes.Thanks for reading my review!McKenzie Lambert...."
4,A Trip Back in Time,"Not much happens in Quiver, Oklahoma, where Frannie Driscoll lives. Then, one day in the summer of 1961, an African- American girl moves to town. The surprising part is, she starts going to Quiver Junior High School, which is an all-white school. The girl, Celeste Chisholm, soon befriends Frannie. Why is the book called the Starplace, you ask? There is a field behind Frannie's house that overlooks Route 66. There once was a playground there, and people built a lot of things there, and one was a slide that they built to look like a rocket. Because of the highway, the playground was moved to a safer location. But they couldn't move the rocket. So the rocket stayed there on Route 66. Anyway, Celeste and Frannie became ""star sisters"" and met in the rocket each night. This book teaches you about religion, freedom and segregation. I reccomend this book to anyone who loves reading about history."
2,Steph's Review,"A black girl moves to a ""white town,"" and isn't treated the best by her peers. However, a girl named Frannie befriends her, and so does a small group of girls. She came with her father, to find out about their family history, and they discovered some interesting things about their ansestors. The klu klux klan had been terrorizing her family for a long time, but she responded better than most people would, she didn't try to get revenge or anything. After a while, Frannie and her friends didn't care about what other people thought about them hanging out with Celeste, and they stuck up for her, even when she would't stick up for herself. This is a very good book that makes what happend in the past, directly after segragation was outlawed, very interesting and you can really relate to this book, and understand everything."
4,Is all we need to know.....,"I nabbed a friend's pre-pub copy of this book because part of the story takes place in Florence and I like to read books that take place in Italy. My all time favorite novel is still Barbara Kingsolver's ""Animal Dreams"" and anyone else who enjoyed that should like this book. This author knows how to weave a tale with some interesting characters and I grew quickly attached to the artist that is the main character. This is delightful reading as Schneider has a magnificent grasp of poetic language that makes it easy to feel immersed not only in the landscape but in the emotions that drives the artist through her process of resolving her grief and coming to terms with her art. I also liked the way the story moves back and forth between the past and the present. I'm looking forward to more from this author."
4,"Wonderful, lyrical","I don't think that it is particularly the story that I love about this book , though it is a good story. The way the book is written, in this lovely, lyrical prose is captivating and engaging. This book is a wonderful rainy-day treat...and it will remain on my bookshelf for years to come."
3,Did I not get it or what?,"I love Barbara Kingsolver's works...so I expected to enjoy this novel as touted. The prose sometimes appeared so simplistic as if a junior high or high school ""girl"" had written it...I just could not appreciate it. There is a story and definitely some insights but a page turner ... not... and unfortunately I pass on to other readers with reservations."
1,Do NOT Buy this,"The item pictured is not what you get. I hate that- now I have to ""easily"" return this item- ""with their no hassle"" return policy. The item I got was straight 1/4"" plugs, patches w/o the extra grounding so nice (and worth the extra $). They are ripping people off."
4,Man's best friends on the trip to Nome,"Great adventure story. Takes all of us into the Alaskan wilderness and the wonder of nature. Winterdance makes us sensitive to the relationship between animals and man and their importance in navigating the hazards of the Alaskan winter. While there is no mention of the reason behind the first Iditarod to Nome, the story was powerful enough to initiate a web search for that medical background."
5,Smooth easy to read,There are some books that transcend their own genre and appeal to everyone. This is one such book. It flows over the funny bone so easily throughout the course of the story that the end comes before you want it to. It is especially poignant for those who have a bond with their significant other (dog). It is my GO TO gift when I need one quick.
5,Bought 8 copies....sent them to all my friends!,"This book was the most delightful story I've read in years.....I read it on the bus to work every morning and laughed all the way to work. This has got to be one of two of my all time favorites. My best friend,after reading it, said she immediately went outside to hitch her cat to a wagon! A quick, delightful read."
5,A five-star read all the way,"Anyone who ever loved dogs will relate as Paulson shares the events leading up to his decision to run the Iditarod. He graphically takes us on the trek with his team, describing how he came to be ""one of them,"" no longer a human leading his team but a member of the pack. Anyone who ever entered a high profile, competitive event as a novice, wholly unprepared for what they were about to experience, will relate as Paulson experiences one surprise and set-back after another upon registering for his first competition. This is a truly gripping first-hand account of what it is to take on this most famous of races."
4,Super,"The beginning of the book was so funny that I had to spend the evening in the bathroom laughing because I had guests upstairs and I was afraid that I would wake them up. If you are an armchair adventurer you will enjoy it and should put it on your reading list. His dedication to the dogs and the race are inspiring. It takes an amazing amount of work and love to be a ""musher"" and race in the Ititarod. I can't wait to read the next book he has written. Wonderful !!!!"
5,Winterdance,Love this book. Have given it to numerous dog friends.I will never look at a skunk in the same way again.If you love sled dogs and are interested in the dog racing scene this is wonderful light entertainment.
3,"Good, not great","First, this is a one-day book, 250 pages of large type. So if you're looking for an in-depth tale of the Iditarod, look elsewhere. Second, the first 50 pages are some of the worst prose I've read in years. But after that Paulsen finds his pace, uneven as it is, and I started to thoroughly enjoy it. Paulsen paints an entertaining picture of his amateurish preparations and training for the race. But the pace shifts again as the race starts and he turns serious. From then on, the reader begins to feel both the stark beauty and the incredible harshness of the race. One can also feel the joy of the dogs who love to run, and sense Paulsen's decline into exhaustion, not so much from his words but from the fact that he writes (I suppose because he recalls) less and less as the race wears on.This is an intensely personal book, full of downright foolhardy determination, and worth the short time it takes to read."
2,Winter didn't dance for me,"Very disappointing book. Boring, lots of padding. Poor and repetative story line. Not well written. Couldn't even read it to the end which I'm sad about as I love books and don't give up easily."
5,WOW!,"I thought this book would bore me. I now give this book as a gift to any friend or relative I meet who has not read it yet. I have bought at least 10 copies for gifts. They all say the same thing ""WOW"". One of my co-workers told me while she was staying with relatives she snuck into the bathroom late at night to keep reading and found herself laughing out loud in the bathroom by herself. Being fond of adventure stories and comedy, this book is by far the best I have ever read on both subjects. I have a hard time now reading, since I expect the same entertainment value I got from Winterdance in other books. It has history, comedy, spiritual awakening, adventure and suspense. It makes you think twice about your own choices in life. It reads easy and fast and it's over too quick. I too have read this book twice."
5,This book will move you,"I was on a first date with a literature fanatic and asked her to name the 5 or 10 best books she ever read. Most were obvious greats...however, she also mentioned Winterdance and told me about the Iditarod. I was so curious that we stopped at a bookstore cafe on the way home from the date and she bought it for me. I read it in two nights and laughed out loud over and over. I have recommended it to several friends and each has thanked me. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
4,Very good,"You don't have to be male to enjoy this book (no offense to Mr. Gannon) -- I'm female & really, really enjoyed this book! It's an interesting tale, well-told by Gary Paulson. It covers the bond he feels with his dogs; the beauty of nature; some hilarious training mishaps and the difficulty and intensity of the Iditarod. I also enjoyed Into Thin Air and similar adventure stories. It's an easy read and the subject matter and how it is approached takes you away from the stresses of everyday life. I very much recommend this book."
5,a great fast read,"Believe it or not, the book actually makes driving dogs through -60F weather sound fun!"
5,Not for the young readers of Dogsong,"Winterdance is may not be ideal for untenured teachers whose students love Paulsen's YA fiction. This is not fiction; this is about Paulsen running the Iditarod. It has some language and situations every teacher might not be comfortable having on their shelves at school. That word of warning said, it's a *great* book. Also, if you live where it gets cold, don't read this book in winter, you will really feel the cold!!!"
5,Laughing all the way,"My husband read this book first. He constantly interrupted whatever I was doing to read it aloud because he was enjoying it so much. Finally, so that he would leave me alone, I agreed to read a chapter. All I can say is that a book has never made me laugh out loud like this one did. We both laughed until tears were running down our cheeks! I am so glad that my husband has never had any inclination to run the Iditarod like Paulsen did. I'm sure that if he had, the results would have been as hilarious as Paulsen's experiences. It's funny enough just to see my husband pack up to go duck hunting with our two Labs. As he drives off with the dogs disagreeing about who will get to sit up front, I am always reminded of the Three Stooges, but instead of Larry, Curly, and Moe, it's Stan, Daisy, and Buddy."
5,Winterdance is side-splitting funny,"This is the funniest book I have ever read. Paulson makes every little scenerio so humerous that its laugh-out-loud yet with such sentiment and feeling. The part where his wife relegates him to the barn because he spends so much time with his dogs that he smells like them is one of the best. You might think that this is totally a ""man's book"" but it is not. I have read this book three times and have purchased it numerous times as a gift. Paulson is at his best in playing out each scene and all of it is true. It is a must read."
5,Mark Twain reincarnated,"Gary Paulsen must have studied his Mark Twain. Like his 19th Century mentor, he's combined self-depricating humor, adventure, astute observation, personal honesty, and impecable comic timing into a page-turning mix that reads so easily you don't realize how hard this stuff is to write. The chapter ""Major Wrecks"" alone is worth the price of admission. Read that chapter aloud to a friend and find out just how perfectly he's set up each and every line.Also (lest the reference to Twain be offputting to modern readers), this book is written in a concise, modern style: not a 19th Century retread, but the way Twain would be writing if he were alive today. I can think of no higher praise. This is, quite simply, one of the finest adventure travel books ever written."
5,Amazing book!!,"This book is amazing!! I feel like I'm right there, through the training and running the race. He has so much honesty in what he feels and sees. I've always wanted to go to Alaska. Through his book, I feel like I got to tag along. THANKS!! I will definitely keep this book and re-read it."
4,This 2003 Christy Award nominee,"is a combination of Lori Wick and Lucy Maude Montgomery. Mrs. Mitchell's descriptions of the landscapes in the Shenandoah Valley makes you feel as though you can see it. The daughter Leah is a teacher at a girls college. She firmly believes this is her lifes calling, and counts out the slightest possibility of romance or getting married. The father, a widower, also counts out the possibility of romance because of his age. With all of his daughters grown and gone, he is becoming very lonely. Entering Mrs. Mitchell's world in ""Virginia Autumn"" is quite an experience. I haven't read book one yet, ""Shenadoah Home"". I'm very anxious to read it to see how these girls grew up. It would probably be better read in sequence. BUT ITS GREAT!!!"
1,STINKY,"I used this stuff years ago - and still works well, but the smell. Smelled like something rotting! Do NOT recommend."
5,Great for very dry hands,"My hands get extremely dry in the winter and this is the best product I have founds for it. I wish it were fragrance-free, but the smell is not strong and just fine."
1,IS THIS A JOKE?,"I LISTENED TO THIS TAPE FOR LAUGHS AND THERE WERE PLENTY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS FUNNIER, THE BREATHLESS READING OR THE INNANE WRITING. ONE THING I MUST ADMIT TO BEING CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT FLABIO EVEN CAME UP WITH THE TITLE BEFORE HIS GHOST WRITER DID ALL THE GRUNT WORK OF CHURNING OUT THIS HACKNEYED FORMULAIC DRECK."
3,Dolls,"""Dolls"" is an average film for the 1980's drive-in fans. It delivers some thrills and chills, the special effects are pretty decent and the music is creepy. The only thing that wasn't done to my satisfication was the performances from the actors and actresses. That lowered my rating for this quite a bit. This is an overall good film, with just one thing missing: high quality performances from actors that I've seen perform very well in other movies."
2,Disappointing,"Billy Drago and Lance Henriksen are two of my absolute favorite actors. When I discovered that they'd been in a movie together, I made it my mission to own it.Once I'd seen it, I felt let down. They share about two scenes together, and everything else about this movie is so boring, I just wanted to cry.Billy and Lance are great, with what they have. Everyone else in the cast needs to stop making movies altogether."
1,Blu-ray is a dud,"This is a review of the blu-ray only. Becket is a fine film, no doubt about that, but the blu-ray has suffered from some terrible processing decisions. Just about everything is outlined with a halo because of Edge Enhancement and grain is missing, faces are smooth and picture seems slightly out of focus because of the excessive use of Digital Noise Reduction. Shame. Probably would have been beautiful if they'd left the grain intact and refrained from using EE."
3,Two of England's Best,O'Toole and Burton light up the screen and provide a truly entertaining view of English nobility.
3,No DVD Missing A Big Seller,"This film deserves so much better treatment. It is a beautiful movie, but the VHS recording is a disaster. Someone with some brains needs to put together a Becket/Lion In Winter DVD set as part of a Peter O'Toole or Richard Burton retrospective. I guess the powers that be would rather make money off of Halloween Part 19 than actually put out a quality product."
4,Very Good Movie Better on Blu-Ray,"I don't think this is a great movie, but it's a very good one.With the elaborate costumes and sets, the movie really benefits from the hi-def treatment -- with only a couple exceptions, the Blu-ray looks far superior to the DVD. (The exceptions are places where enhanced clarity makes film tricks like matte paintings more obvious. I still prefer the hi-def image without reservation.)I tend to imagine Peter O'Toole as too big a star to give his attention to DVD commentary tracks, but he does a commentary track here and is fully engaged, interesting and informative.The Blu-ray supplements are missing two archival interviews with Richard Burton that appear on the DVD. (The interviews are interesting, but there is no mention of Becket in either of them.)"
5,A fantastic historical drama,"A great movie about one of the greatest figures in English history, Thomas Becket. Richard Burton does an excellent portrayal of Becket as Peter O'Toole does of portraying Henry II. Although the film takes liberties of the historical events of the lives of these two, it doesn't in anyway effect the plot and drama of the movie. A great scene in the movie is when Becket (Burton) says to Henry II (O'Toole) ""do not do this"" when Henry II insists that Becket takes the title of Archbiship. It would be interesting to know what the actual thoughts of Thomas Becket were when we was offered the office of Archbishop in the 12th century. A great movie that should be more known to movie enthusiasts as it is now."
5,highly recommended,"In a few words, this movie provides a high class of acting for today's actors so they may do good in watching it before calling themselves ""actors"". While Thomas Becket's role played by Richard Burton is a fine performance, Peter O'Toole in his role of Henry II is just attonishing. Besides that, the movie offers an interesting and entertaining episode of the conflict between religion (and its associated morality) and politics that could easily be extended to our current times. This is the framework that causes a love and hate relationship between Henry and Becket. This movie goes along similar lines as ""A man for all seasons"" or ""A lion in winter"" if you would like to try similar some features. Technically, a very nice digital transfer with a good sound too. Audio is provided in both English and Spanish. Sadly, only English subtitles were included."
2,Will this EVER be on DVD??,"What a wonderful movie buta horrific version on VHS. Some of the scenes are so dark you have to really stretch to even make out basic facial features. It's sad indeed, with one of the best films by both Burton and O'Toole."
5,Becket,In my opinion this is one of the finest movies ever made. Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton gave performances unmatched anywhere.
5,Peter O'Toole's finest!!!,"This film is in my opinion OFF the charts on most levels!!! For any fans of Lion in Winter , this is a MUST see!!! For students of film and drama this is a benchmark of pristine, powerful and heartfelt delivery of the director's and the script writers intentions. Furthermore, the film's transfer onto DVDis gorgeous!!! I would even go as far to say that ALL actors on any level be it stage or film can learn from this epic film which features a STELLAR cast! This was directed by Peter Glenville as well as gracing the New York Stage courtesy of Mr.David Merrick and received a whopping 12 Academy Award nomimations only to lose the Best Picture award to My Fair Lady A popularity contest AT BEST!Do yourself a favor and see this film ASAP!!!!"
5,Outstanding,"Finally one of the most intelligent epics ever filmed has been given excellent treatment in it's transfer to DVD. Superb performances, excellent script, stunning cinematography, terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtract, not to mention a fascinating story. Highly recommended."
4,Engaging!,After watching this movie I find myself wanting to find out more about Thomas Becket.I always new he was a martyr for his beliefs and that he was assassinated at Canterbury but never new of the politics of his placement as archbishop by his friend King Henry II.The word play is engaging and intelligent.You will find yourself laughing at times and at other times find yourself wondering what Thomas is experienceing. Very thought provoking.
4,Buy it for the voices,"You do not hear their like today. And Burton's talent has been forgotten. But it was glorious, when well used. What drink can do."
4,A Classic Revived,"Becket is a classic movie with some great actors obviously enjoying playing off each other. The film is a talk-fest most of the time, and certainly lacks some major action scenes, but is still a memorable movie, and this DVD edition has been beautifully restored.Of the bonus features, the interview with the film's original editor is well worth watching for the extra dimension it gives to the film and acting performances (as well as insight into the actors' liesure activities!)"
4,Classic pairing,"If you like to see two acting titans perfectly matched and paired, then this little gem is for you. Not too bad for history buffs, either, although I would criticize the short shrift the makers of the film made of Eleanor of Aquitaine, a very important figure for the development of the courtly culture of the Middle Ages, here reduced to nothing more than an irritating wife coming between to fellas. Otherwise, a great buy."
1,Tremendous still after 40 years,"It finally arrived after seven weeks, but the wait was worthwhile.A trulytremendous film with the most superb acting by Peter O'toole and RichardBurton - a masterful and riveting performance. The quality of this 40 year old production in sound and vision was superb, well above what I expected from such and old film. Beautifully re-mastered!I loved this when it was on circuit in the sixties and saw it no less than four times. Now, forty years later, it still had me spellbound for two and a half hours.Highly recommended to the younger generation who never saw it before forit's wonderful acting by two of the world's best actors.John Plimmer, Montagu, Western Cape Province, South Africa"
1,I couldn't sit through this one...,"Fabulous casting....but, lord the acting was campy. Very much a Mel Brooks type of thing...purely stupid & silly. Highly disappointing, but...perhaps the film became very grand after I shut it off in disgust."
3,Bad Sound,Movie is great but the sound is terrible. I had to have the remote in my hand the whole time to raise the volume so I could hear people talking and then turn it down for the other scenes. I really don't recommend this movie...waste of money.
2,Becket -- DVD,"I remembered ""Becket"" from its movie release ('66?), recalling it as a wonderfully powerful film of conscience with robust contributions by Burton & O'Toole. When it came to DVD I immediately ordered it. However, I found that the film did not stand up to the memories of a 14 year old. Shot almost as a play -- though there are good location scenes -- it came across as overly dialogue-driven ... again, great theater but not-so-great cinema. Also, and unfortunately, the acting now seems over-the-top almost to the point of over-wrought hysteria, and this in more than a few places. So, some things age well like wine while others regrettably turn to vinegar."
3,Provides insight,Enjoyable. This book provides good insight into what life in the pre-WWII Army was like. You should enjoy this book if you have any interest in the military.
1,Nothing to do with meditation!,This is a coloring book. Mandalas are drawn very poorly.If you are into mandalas you are going to be disappointed.This book is a misrepresentation.
5,Web page shows item in wrong color,"While this is an excellent item and fits its niche perfectly; needing to carry a 17 inch laptop, SLR camera, a few lens, plus other miscellaneous gear and all in one bag. At the time of my receiving this item (Friday, May 9th, 2008) , I came to find out that the product image (which I went based off of) doesn't match the product description. If you order this item, you will receive the Camo/Black color scheme instead of the Red/Black one that is shown in the image. Hopefully Amazon will address this issue shortly."
4,A fun trip down memory lane,"I enjoyed the book. It's mostly a collection of photographs from Parliament's ""Aqua Boogie"" tour. The costumes are crazy and it's fun to read about the methods behind the madness. A must for any true P-Funk fan but it probably would not interest the part time funkateers."
5,A favorite,I buy these for my husband every year or two. I like the fact that you can buy a larger frame and that they are not all just standard size. They fit him well and they are very sturdy and stand up to much use.
5,In love with these sunglasses!,"I've always wanted a pair of ray bans, but I was always hesitant to spend that much money on a pair of sunglasses. I finally decided to buy a pair and I have to say that I really don't regret it at all. The sunglasses are super sturdy; I hit myself with my car door, leaving a huge throbbing sensation on the bridge of my nose, but on the bright side, my sunglasses were totally fine. I wear them everywhere now and I just love the way it looks. I've tried on both sizes, but I really like the smaller one better than the larger size. The 4mm difference may seem like very little, but the 54mm's looked too big on my face."
4,"Cool, but you have to like orange",Bought these RayBans for our grandson. He's quite pleased with them and I think they attract a lot of attention. He has a pair of lime green ones but the university he's going to attend this fall has official colors of orange and black - so he had to have the orange and they are perfect for him.
4,Very Cool!,These Ray-Ban sunglasses are the bomb! They fit very comfortably and feel lightweight on your nose. Would recommend Ray-Bans to anyone.
4,Stylish,Purchased as a gift for my husband. They fit great and look fun! Love Ray Ban - great quality! Very retro!
1,BEWARE,"I have purchased Ray-Ban glasses for many years. Recently, I got a bad pair and I was happy that I was dealing (though I was dealing) with a high end company. Well, this is not the case with Ray-Ban. The warranty department is nearly impossible to reach and they do not honor the 1yr defect policy. Mine fell apart at the hing and they wanted about 3/4 of the price to fix them! I'm not going to purchase from this company any longer and I recommend that you do the same."
2,Not Described right,"Ordered these thinking they were 50mm when in fact they showed up as 54mm. When you return something you have 10 days to do it and have to pay for the return as well. After 5 or so weeks and about $30 extra out of my pocket, I finally had the 50mm. Make sure you really look at what you are buying with these people and email them if you are uncertain."
2,Not as expected,"I bought one pair of shades from defineyoureyes and was amazing, but this second buy was horrible. The product looks like a replica. One arm crooked, the RB logo in the glasses was done by hand on the glass. The sunglasses looks cool but the product doesnt looks like i expected."
1,Way too big!!,"I tried on the exact same pair that a co-worker has, and they fit great. I decide to order my own pair, paid $85.00 for them, and they slipped off my face every time I looked down. Not sure what the problem was, but they are currently en-route back to Amazon!!!"
4,Pleased with purchase!,"I was a little nervous ordering these online since there are so many variations of them but they came, and they are exactly what i ordered and wanted. They are a sturdy and classic pair of sunglasses that I hope to have for a long time."
4,Classic and Classy,"Wayfarers are retro cool. I ended up giving these to my 18yr old to wear to H.S. I had a pair all through h.s. and college, lifeguarding... until I wore them out.Maui Jim offers spring loaded hinges which make their glasses more comfortable, but you can't beat Wayfarers for classic cool.David"
5,Very happy!,"I ordered these from Paris Miki on Amazon on the 18th and they arrived today (20th)and I absolutely love them. I was a bit skeptical ordering Ray-Bans online but for about $50 off I took the chance, they are authentic (have all the characteristics of authentic ones; etched ""RB"", metal rods, ""Ray-Ban"" on the snap closure of the case plus they have a really nice weight to them) and totally worth the price. I'm very pleased with the seller and the product, these sunglasses are timeless and I couldn't be happier to finally own a pair."
5,Great quality and fast shipment,"Great quality and fast shipment, you can't go wrong here. Great quality and fast shipment, you can't go wrong here."
1,Not what I ordered,"Don't be misled by the picture or by the description of these sunglasses. I wanted orange and thought these were perfect, however, when I got the product, they were anything BUT orange. If you want brown sunglasses, then these are for you, but if you wanted a cool orange (instead of the neon orange), then these are most definitely not for you. I returned mine instantly. Very disappointing."
1,These were not Wayfarers...they were Wayfarer II's,The glasses were incorrectly described...these are the new not the old style that were listed in the title.Amazon took them back as a returnSG
1,2ndhand full of scratches,I got a 2nd hand rayban with many scratches on it. I think it's original but i thought i would have a brand new pair of glasses but they sent me a pair of 2nd hand pair of rayban.
5,Original Ray Ban Wafarer,I ordered the Original Ray Ban Wayfarer from Sunglass Express on Amazon. They shipped that day. The package was in great shape when it arrived. Double boxed with an exterior carton and the Ray Ban box within. The glasses are exactly as I remember them. I couldn't be happier with the transaction.
4,great sunglasses,"This is the first pair of expensive sunglasses that I have ever owned and they are well worth the price. They are fun, stylish and perfect for partying outside.They have gotten a couples of nicks/scratches on the lenses. I don't really know where they came from/how they happened, but they do not block my visions and are not really too bad."
5,Ray-Ban RB2140,"this was definitely a great deal.the price was great at 95 dollars who could complain.i went to the mall searching for these glasses and they were priced at 145 dollars.i would definitely recommend these shades,they look great and seem durable"
5,Wayfarer 2140,The sunglasses are the coolest and they came with all the Rayban original stuff. The shipping service was a little poor though.
5,Great Sunglasses!,The perfect cool pair of shades that is perfect for any cool dude. Ray-Ban's are of course of great quality and worth the money. that is pretty much it.
1,worst customer service ever,"Apparently the 50mm don't exist, as I tried to order them, but received the 54mm twice. When asking Amazon and the sunglasses company why the mistake kept happening, neither owned up to the issue, or could even answer me."
1,dont do it,"Definitely do not bother. I was really excited to buy these glasses here instead of from the retailer because i would have been saving $30 or so, but do not bother with these, they're an imitation. If you're going to spend $70 on sunglasses, you might as well get the real ones for $114 from ray ban themselves, or buy the $5 imitation kind, because that is what these are worth. I'm really disappointed it took me too long to realize this fact, and so now I cant get refunded. Please do not waste your money."
1,No Sunglasses?,Ordered the glasses and only got a case in the mail; no glasses inside. Haven't accepted my return yet and all of my messages have been sent without a reply.
1,The item was not delivered.,"First i got an email about my item being shipped, and they charged it on my credit card. A couple of days later, another email about a refound and it was confusing. Then i got in touch with the company and they were just like ""it was a mistake. The item is out of stock"" Even though when i added it to the cart they were plenty in stock!. So, i still don't know why amazon is asking me to rate a transaction that was a failure :s"
4,Great Shades,My daughter has wanted some Ray-Bans forever. We ordered these and even though we did have some delivery problems (not the company's fault but the postal service's fault) we finally got the glasses and my daughter loves them! Thanks so much for making a high school senior happy!
1,Buyer beware!,"Ordered black on black wayfarers, what was sent was tortoise shell and gold metal, Made In China, called RayBan, and was informed that they have been out of stock for a long time on the black on black wayfarers. Also found out that rayban is now officially making lower grade ray-bans in China....Shame Shame Shame, yet another company gone to the realm of cheap labor...Sad.....shouldn't advertise something you don't have nor will..."
1,What a cheap piece of c**p,"Spend this much for glasses and you expect them to last! Lasted three months and the temple fell apart - can't return them anymore, and RayBan charges $100 to fix them, so we wasted money on there. It is better to get cheaper glasses that can be repaired. Also, the marked is so full of counterfeits, we are not even sure what we got."
3,Ray Ban Originals,"The Ray Ban glasses I purchased were rec'd in pefect condition. These are authentic RBs , not a knock off but still about 30% less than retail. HOWEVER, I thought I was getting the dark black/grey lenses but what they sent were green lenses which are cheaper (I believe) than the daker lenses. The product description does NOT mention green lenses."
4,Buy these.,"So, I was skeptical. I ended up paying $94 for the Black/Red Mania with shipping, so that's like a $50 discount from what I would have paid in a store. With that being said, these are great sunglasses. They're heavy, but not too heavy that they weigh down your face. If you get lenses, get the G-15's XLT they're the original ""Ray-Ban"" lens and they really works great, I can look at the sun without it hurting my eyes. They feel expensive, well made. I'll add more when I get my prescription put in."
3,Wrong color case received,I received a brown color case for these glasses while the pictures show a black color caseRay-Ban RB2140 Original Wayfarer Sunglasses
4,Great fit,"Very comfy. Most sunglasses hurt my ears after I've been wearing them a while, but not these. I have a small face and the smaller size fits perfectly. I just wish the gradient was darker!"
4,Great Service. Would Recommend,Great service. However the only problem occurred when I dropped my glasses the day after opening and they could not replace the lenses. However that is understandable as they only sell the whole glasses.
1,Don't do it........,"If they don't fit, you get charged a $29+ restocking fee, buy them somewhere else pr you will get charged"
2,Bridge Size: A Word of Caution,"I ordered a pair of tortoise/G-15XLT original wayfarers and I received black ones instead with a 22mm bridge, no big deal. The problem was when I placed the order again for the tortoise ones, received them and they were still 22mm. The way I could tell is by the model numbers inscribed on the inside of the left arm which reads RB2140-902-[50/22]. In my ever so lengthy hunt for wayfarers that fit a smaller face, which are the true original ones that come with a 15mm bridge, I stumbled on this Amazon listing that advertises exactly that, a 15mm bridge. Lo and behold. But beware, Amazon is falsely advertising and does not actually have any 15mm bridge sized Wayfarer's whatsoever which I found out after contacting the marketplace seller directly who told me that Amazon is the party responsible for the false advertising. I gave it two stars not because of the product itself but because of the lack of care to accurately depict the product."
5,ORIGINAL WAYFARER White on Black RB 2140 original,"The only Ray Ban glasses, the way it was ment to be. Can be a Brand's ""visit card"".The Only Ray Ban model, without any compromise."
2,wtf?,"the glasses came in a box that was squished in transit, let alone the smallest box to fit a pair of sun glasses in them. they came crooked and they have a scratch on the frame. thinking about returning the package..the whole reason i bought online is so i wouldn't get a display pair of expensive sun glasses."
1,Dont purchase 54mm if your a man,"Hmmm this is a tough one, I couldn't decide if I liked the glasses or not, they fit great! But.... I think they look like GIRL glasses, which I think its because the size 54mm (go smaller,and they wont look like female glasses!) I didnt notice until I started seeing pictures of myself. I'm unpleased that I wasted money on glasses that I'll never wear, its the one downfall to ordering items like this on the internet. So if your a man DO NOT buy these glasses in the 54mm. BUY A SMALLER SIZE!I hope this will help for someones future purchase!Thanks"
5,scared,"i was pretty scared to purchase these online cause im not much of a online shopper but i really wanted raybans, and i didnt want to pay $150 for them so i just took a risk one day fearing what if they arent real ray bans or if the size will be to small or big, but finally i just bought them and i was pleased with the product when they arrived it came in a case just as if i bought them from a store for $150 i will now not fear shopping online"
5,expensive,but the first sunglasses i've taken care of.solid structurewill retain its valueyou will see these glasses sell for a lot in vintage stores
4,Great Buy,I would recommend this product. It is a gift so I have not actually worn them but I think they will be perfect for my son.
2,Not Impressed with the product but Amazon's great as always,Good price and it arrived quickly. No problems with Amazon but this tank doesn't include the hoses so now my hubby has to figure out how to make an attachment that won't leak. Talked to someone else who owns the same one and they confirmed the parts aren't missing- they were never included on this model even though the instructions say they are! Basically it's a tank with wheels and a cap over the drain hole.
5,Great Independent Film,"Saw it at the 2011 Hollywood Film Festival. My favorite Inde film. Great suspense flick, leading up to the big dramatic moment when one realizes that it's the choices we make in life, what we do and what we don't do, that put us where we are today. Makes you think. Well shot, well edited it's a gem."
1,Puts you to sleep faster than Ambien!,"I don't usually review films, but considering how highly this one is rated on here compared to how bad the movie actually is, I had to speak up!I can't believe this film has a single 5 star rating, let alone several. It's boring as hell. The reviewers that are giving high ratings must be friends of the movie makers or something. It's a B movie with B actors, none of which I recognized. Unbelievable borefest. Don't waste your time!"
1,Would like to return it!,The book took way too long to get to me. By the time I received it I had already bought another one. I wasn't sure if it was still even coming bc it had been so long. So now I'm stuck with an extrabook that I don't even need.
1,Reseller Campus_Books,"My order was processed and accepted. Then an email came the next day indicating that the CAMPUS BOOKS did not have the book in stock - even though CAMPUS BOOKS indicated that ""in stock."""
4,Corrections Review,"I mean what can you really review about a college text book? It is an interesting book, but none the less its required reading for me."
1,Don't buy from this seller EVER!!!!,"This seller sent me the wrong book and NEVER did anything about it to get the situation straight. They ignored all of my emails, but thanks to Amazon's A to Z guarantee I was able to get my money back and finally get the correct book I needed. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good fuel injectors,Beck Arnley is a good product and better than Python which fails a lot.These have worked just fine and are a better value for the money.Never had a B/A product fail ever.
5,Toy,I ordered this doll for my own craft purposes. It is amazing all the items that come in the package with the doll. And the price was well worth the entire item and accessories. It is really durable. The head is really heavy but I love how the eye color and positioning of the eyes change with just a click of a button at the top of her head. I recommend this item.
1,Poor Blythe doll bootleg,"This doll is nothing but a bootleg of the very unique and expensive Blythe Doll , now thats a cute doll. In comparison this looks like a dragqueen when you compare it to the Blythe Dolls as you can see I'm a Blythe fan all the way ....in conclussion do not get it is cheap,it will break, and you will be better off getting an original Blythe true they are a bit $$$ expensive but in my opinion they are way better than this crappy things."
4,"Excellent Character Development, High Action","I had not read John C. Hoking's Conan tales before this one. If he has any others, I would read them. Emerald Lotus was pretty good, I would recommend it as better than most of the Conan spinoffs published by Tor or Ace. The carnivorous plant featured as antagonist in this tale is not terribly original, but it's wizardly gardener seeking to harvest the plant's magic is a well crafted and compelling enemy for Conan to encounter. Conan's travel mates in this story are not as annoying as some of the other's he has been saddled with. If you are looking for a Conan read that is a little more involved and rich in character development then I would recommend Emerald Lotus. Hocking keeps the action coming at a good pace and also does a good job of bringing Conan's world to life."
3,Definately not a MUST read,"I absolutely love the conan character and have read a large portion of the conan books. This is an average book, has suspense at times and some classic conan. However Conan gets his butt handed to him twice as a previous review points out and not to mention the main protagonist is a sorceror who is like a drug addict. Oh and i almost forgot, the evil monster conan fights at the end of the book is a friggin plant!!!"
2,don't be fooled,"Another ho-hum entry into the non-Howard Conan genre. Unlike John Maddox Roberts or Robert Jordan, two of the better Conan writers, Hocking writes a very middle of the road fantasy novel that just happens to have Conan in it. He makes the mistake of spending way too much time with villains and other characters and not enough time with Conan. And he doesn't really know the character that well, so Conan seems fairly indispensable here. As a rule, other than Karl Edward Wagner's ""Road of Kings,"" stick with John Maddox Roberts or Robert Jordan when ranging in the non-Howard Conan field."
2,Super Reader,"Sorceress, evil sorceress, or barbarian hero, pretty much no-one wants to hear these words:'""You die for Nyarlathotep."" Needle talons stroked the air and its eyesburned brighter.Ethram-Fal spoke haltingly in Old Stygian. ""You make sacrifice?"" Itbobbed its head, bird-like.""Yes. Yes. Antelope. Scorpion. Man. Man best. You die forNyarlathotep.""'Otherwise, this is a not very good Conan pastiche to do with an object of enhancement of mystical power, The Emerald Lotus."
2,no loutus dream,"i lie howard's stories. ut his ""successors""..... Well, this could actually have been good. good descriptions and suspenceful at times. but there are too many pages where nothing happens. and it is not necessary to use so much time to explain the intrigue through lengthy dialogue, we get it. and towards the end, it doesn't deliver. the ending should have been better and more a natural link to the story."
3,Secondary Sources,"I was interested in reading this book because I remembered the media circus that was caused in Vancouver. This book traces all the steps that Pavel Bure indured from his early career in Russia to the time he was a Panther. Banks also gives insight regarding the heavy flow of Russian players that got signed or drafted by NHL teams in the early 1990s. The proble with this book was that Banks had to rely primarily of secondary sources, usually from the local Vancouver sports media. He was unable to get the assistance from key figures such as Brian Burke, Pat Quinn, key Canuck players, family and friends. As a resident of Vancouver who read most of the newspaper articles that were cited in this book, all Banks did was acumilated secodary sources that is available to the public into one abridged book. Primary resoursed could have made this book a worthwhile read."
3,I thought it was okay,"It wasn't as good as I thought it'd be or that the PBFC made it out to be. I loved some of the stories, they were just so good and there's a few little facts that I didn't know but whether they're true or not is yet to be decided. I loved the pics!"
5,Great But Get Koss PortaPro Headphones with it!,"I bought this solely to use for jogging & working out & it kicks butt! It's great. Excellent sound. Superlight & small. Fast downloads. Easy & Effective software. One total bit of advice, as in most of these players, the company gives you free earbuds which suck- they're uncomfortable, don't stay in, etc. I personally hate earbuds. I would totally recommend you purchase for around $40-50 or so online including shipping, Koss's great portapro headphones. These headphones are superlight, give very good sound with good but not overbearing bass response & are supercomfortable & stay on your ears without slipping when you're jogging & working out & best as I said, they're supercomfortable & you don't even know you're wearing them! Anyway, Zen Nano Plus is a winner. It is also very durable. I dropped mine a couple of times & it did no damage & still plays & looks great."
4,My lil Gem,"I got this as a birthday present, and so far im very happy to say my only gripe is that they couldnt find the 1 gig one.fits really good in your hand, controls are pretty natrual too.lets say you want to know if mP3 players are something worth your money or not. try it out, you'll love it."
5,Better than I expected,"I did my research before purchasing this item... looking for something within a hundred bucks(preferably) and something that had great reviews. I narrowed it down to a few MP3's, and both my daughters prefered the zen nano plus 512. It arrived quickly, and its been a week since they received it and they LOVE it! The sound is great, to get songs in there is easy and fast, and functions are simple. I fully recommend this to anyone shopping for an affordable mini MP3 player."
4,Creative Zen Nano Plus.. exactly what it says,"I love this little device. I have downloaded songs from CD's, Napster and the radio, all sound clear and it is used everyday. The only thing that I would like to be better is the battery life. Compared to other music devices I have this one goes through the battery really fast. Would recommend it to people and already have"
2,not built to last,"I bought this thing about 22 months ago, just under 2 years. I have to say I did not use this thing a terrible lot, maybe a couple times a week. It was fine, radio reception was crap, but not long after I got it the battery cover broke. About a month ago the MP3 playback mysteriously started dying. I have no idea how a solid-state device like this could just die but it has. It slowly started playing back fewer and fewer files properly until now all I hear is a clanging noise when trying to playback audio. Radio still works as well as it ever did."
3,It's OK,"Sound quality is ok for my purposes. I just use the player for listening to podcasts while exercising, so audio quality isn't a huge concern and I can't really comment on it. Main complaint is that the power/pause/play button is perfectly positioned to be accidentally pushed when you are squeezing the belt clip to attach or remove the device. Also, the display light is very dim, and navigation is somewhat difficult. FM radio reception is very weak, but that's probably to be expected given the lack of antenna surface area."
4,My wife loves it,"My wife wanted a simple mp3 player that she could work out with, and she's very happy with this. The included arm band and protective sleeve are perfect for her when she's jogging or on a treadmill, and the sleeve has a belt clip that's nice for when she's using weights and does not want something around her arm. The only complaint is that the included earbuds tend to fall out when she jogs."
4,Almost perfect...,"This is a great little player. All of the songs are very clear sounding. We couldn't use Napster though, it kept saying that it wasn't compatible. The headphones aren't comfortable either, which is a minor thing. My son has this player too, and he thinks it's great."
3,Support OkayPlayer and buy this album but....,"True Notes Vol. 1 really isnt nearly as good as it could have been. I wanted the album to succeed, and I bought True Notes to support Okay Player, as I respect them more than any other crew in Hip-Hop, but there are simply too many tracks that fall short for this album to be a classic. While Little Brother's The Listening was a fantastic album, and their track on Pete Rock's Soul Survivor II was tremendous, the track they serve on True Notes is bland. The Roots track is actually old, and the Dialated People's track I could do without completely. The Jean Grae and Skillz tracks are gems, but other than that, I cant really say Im impressed with the album as a whole. If you want a banger from Okayplayer, get The new Roots album."
4,It's Definitely O.K. Player,"This review will be short. It's an overall dope CD with only a few bad songs (including the usually consistent Madlib). Remember, look at this CD more so as a collection of songs than an actual ""album""."
1,Rock Fan,"This album isn't a play again and again kind of album. If you want a thumpin good sound, I recommend the Quadrajets The World's On Fire."
1,Stay away from Panasonic!!!,"I would put it below 1 star. My 5-disc Panasonic unit died of the infamous H07 code after 14 months. After searching H07 on google, the H07 is common on Panasonic DVD players, and it means it is time for a new player. Stay away from Panasonic!!! This changed my mind about Panasonic entirely."
3,So far so good,"So far, all I've played on this player are DVDs, VCDs, and CD-Rs and it works fine. Although the player is a little slow to startup because it reads in some data first, it's not too bad. My old Sony cost 3 times more, but it was faster. This Panasonic makes a few noises when changing discs and stuff, but no big deal. The display is a bit small as well. Other than these things, the picture quality has been superb on my 32"" Sony television via S-video connections. You can't beat the price though and the free shipping."
4,Cant beat it for the $,"I'm sure there are better players out there, but not for this price. The slim design looks cool, but has 2 drawbacks, 1. if you listen to alot of music on it without the tv on its kind of hard to see whats going on, although the track numbers are large the rest of the info is tiny 2. the remote sensor is all the way to the right side, so the frame of the door that closes on my stereo rack blocked the signal, then again the slim design made it easy to find a hole to fit it in. Great picture, great sound I'm extremely happy"
4,Pretty Great.,"Yeah, So I purchased this social stratification book for one of my sociology classes. I have to say its pretty great. It covers a lot of information that I was dumbfounded by... And I love the silly little examples it gives. All in all it I very well enjoy the book. Out of all the books I currently have for school I would have to say that this one is a keeper. It's great... Only thing I would complain about was the fact that it took a little while to get here... but that doesn't really affect my opinion on the knowledge it presents."
5,"Nice simple box, clean lines, well made","Good quality, sturdy, standard cards and cards with tabs fit fine. It has a nice bamboo grain look and a solid feel."
4,Could have been better!,"The author is leading presidential historian. This book is desired to really get a feel and understanding without being overly analytical and intellectualized. It can be humorous at times as well. I would have felt that the history of presidential inaugurations would have been better enhanced by visual images such as actual photographs or illustrations. Other than that, the author does a good job in detailing the history of everything from choosing the date, the first inauguration, the first inaugural ball, and other first that make the occasion both special and unique. It's an American tradition followed by rituals evolved over time. With the recent inauguration of President Obama, the book helps the reader understand how a President-elect becomes President. The book would be good for history buffs as well."
2,"Good price, bright light,, bad resolution","I just wanted to point out that this in indeed an 800x600 resolution projector, and that you can see every one of the 800 by 600 squares that make up the screen.It is bright, and cheap, but for 100 bucks more you can get a new 1024x768 projector, or an even nicer used or refurbished projector.I also want to point out that the fan shoots heat out right next to the lens in the front, so you can often see a heat differential in the air that shows up as a moving shadow (like smoke) on the screen."
3,Quiet ambient Didjeridu,I was looking for a CD that had Didj but without music overlays (for meditation). This is a good fit. Very quiet.
3,"Nicely executed and focused, if a little shallow","The story of Sabina Spielrein is becoming more well known. This is one of two movies on her life now. There are several books. As more research and scholarship is done, it is apparent that Sabina probably did NOT have a love affair with Jung as depicted in - and central to - this film. The definitive Sabina Speilrein movie has not been made yet, it my opinion. It seels that many people sense a sort of 'grander mystery' behind Speilrein's story when they first hear it, but this film only hints at that rather than unfolding it further. But this attempt does what it does well."
3,Not as fantastic (for me) as everyone says,"I checked this book out after reading (and loving) Corelli's Mandolin. Several reviews compared the two books favorably. In my opinion though, the Helprin book is not nearly as captivating. In fact, I find the main character somewhat tiresome, the writing a bit hackneyed and in general, I'm just not terribly engaged by it. I find that in many places the prose drags a good deal. I don't find the premise of the book convincing (a tale told while on a 2 day non-stop hike) or even particularly believable. Too bad -- I was hoping to really like it."
1,I Couldn't Win This War,"Normally I like lengthy tomes and epic novels. I just couldn't get into this one. After 60 pages I put it down. If a novel doesn't grab me by the first 50 pages, I go on to the next. Because of the solid reviews, I gave this one 60 pages. That is too long to read and be bored. The writing quality is good. Maybe if I stayed with it for another 100 pages it would have spoken to me."
2,"Historically fascinating, but as a story it was week","The background and historical perspective of WWI Italy was truly fascinating. The absolute waste of human life was mind boggling. But....Helprins character ""Allesandro"" reminded me more of a comic book super hero. His character became very predictable and I found my toes curled more and more after each and every heroic encounter. I know they say truth is stranger than fiction ,but on this occasion the fiction was very strange."
3,"Love it as I did when I first read it, but do not reread.","When Soldier of the Great War was first published I read it and liked it so much I recommended it to all my friends. They, like I, loved it, and we all felt it was a must reread. I am now rereading it for a book group, and it's been a terrible disappointment. It is the only book I have ever reread that I remembered liking the first time around and failed to find anything new or other layers I missed the first time. Hold on to your memories of it - for the first read is truly worthwhile. The second time around it begins to sounds like ""The Perils of Pauline""."
3,Great writing.,"I loved the writing style, the memorable and quote able passages and the descriptive language. As the aunt of someone about to enter the military, this book really helped me come to terms with war and soldiers. But after about 50% of the book, I began to find it tedious and slow going so I did not finish it."
4,Amazing!,I read this book a few years ago and loved it. This book stays with you forever. If you loved A Soldier of the Great War you will also love Chris Bohjalian's A Skeleton at the Feast about the end of World War II. Both books kept me awake late into the night and I will never forget either one of them.
4,Reminds Us Of The Insanity of War,"I am not sure why we need to be reminded of the insanity of war, any war. What it does to people's lives besides cutting them short. People die for reasons they never understand. Sometimes it's nothing more than a bureaucratic gambit. Helprin's writing is superb. For some tastes it may be long-winded and wordy and often times philosophical. But it's hard to write about war in a telling manner in clever sound bytes, though our politicians try, and that texting on our smartphones demands. Take your time with this read. Don't expect feel good or neat endings. It made me want to read everything by Helprin. Not sure why I hadn't read these ages ago. They are ""old."""
4,the whole is not greater than the sum of it's parts,"At times the story grabbed me and held me and I couldn't put the book down. At other times it seemed to drag on endlessly. As others have said, the prose is fantastic. But the pieces didn't fit well for me. More time was spent developing the character of Alessandro's first crush, who vanished after 200 pages never to emerge again, than was spent on his lifetime love, Ariane. And the surrealistic dwarf, while fascinating, seemed out of place in the book. There were moments when I thought - ""I love this book"", but when I was finally finished I didn't have that feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment that comes when you have finished a truly great work. Still - I would recommend it to fast readers and those who have lots of time to read many books."
5,Heartwarming and unforgettable.,"A woman colleague of mine heartily recommended this book to me. It seemed strange (myself a woman) to purchase a book about a soldier in WWI. As soon as I got into the book, I found out why...Mark Helprin made me laugh, cry, sigh at his beautiful wizardry of words, marvel at the brave, courageous Allesandro Giuliani, and revel in his insights of love and honor. I have fallen hard for Mark Helprin and can't get enough. I have since read A Winter's Tale and am now fully engrossed in Memoirs of Antproof Case. Each one of them magical, uplifting, and beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Helprin."
3,Curate's egg,"This novel is a bit like warfare itself- moments of furious action punctuated by long intervals of longeurs. In attempting his ""magnum-octopus"" Helprin has created an Italian superman who can ride like a centaur, climb like a monkey, swim like a fish, and fight like a tiger as well as having an oh-so refined aesthetic sensibility that would make a pre-raphaelite high priest cringe. The cringe factor is lessened by two much more interesting creations, namely, a psychotic poison-dwarf who singlehandedly sabotages the entire Italian war effort and an eccentric battle-averse cavalry field marshall. These two, if only they'd been developed more, would have made it into a genuinely ripping tale."
4,Lengthy but worth the time to read,"I NEVER would have read this book had it not been recommended to me. The length is enough to scare someone away! Once I got into the story it made me WANT to KEEP reading. I almost felt like Alessandro was my friend & couldn't wait to be with him everyday. I was sad when I finally finished reading the book. Yes - it IS long but worth the investment of time. It CAN be a little wordy but it was still enjoyable. You get to experience the Trials & Tribulations of Alessandro & I found myself forever rooting for him to overcome his adversities. He comes out a better man , NOT a bitter man despite all he experiences..... Read it, don't rush through it."
5,An epic must-read for anyone afflicted with a beating heart.,"Mark Helprin masterfully chronicles the life of an old man, and in so doing reminds us that even the most outwardly unremarkable souls among us have a trully remarkable story to tell. The story is set in Italy, as Allesandro, in his mid seventies, relates his life story to a young man while on a long journey. The defining moments in Allesandro's life center around the horror of WWI, but out of that carnage, his spirit repeatedly soars. Though nearly everthing dear to him is taken, he never loses his ability to love.This book should be read by everyone because it illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit in deplorable conditions, and gives us the perspective to deal with everyday life's comparatively minor inconveniences. It has prompted me to look at others in a different way, and to wonder at the rich life stories hidden away in each of those anonymous passers-by"
1,Disjointed and unconvincing,"Helprin borrows themes and images from many great books, but the result doesn't add up to a work of art. His rip-off of Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" is doubly offensive in that his crypto-fascist hero ends up going back into the war with a renewed sense of patriotic fervor, which goes against anything I have ever read of the true feelings of the typical WWI soldier by the end of the war. Helprin's use of ""magical realism"" is stale, and smacks of adolescent wish-fulfillment. One of the few books I have thrown away unfinished."
1,Moved me to tears,"This book made me want to cry, it was so dreadful. The hero reminds me of people I've met who just can't keep from telling lies about themselves; after a short while, it gets very tiresome."
3,"Beautiful language, but needs lots of editing","I haven't encountered such beautiful language in a long time. I liked the vivid descriptions of beauty; I had many ""ah ah"" moments when talk of eternity and truth were encountered, but....the plot was long, drawn out, and needed alot of editing."
3,"At 792 Pages, just a bit too long and overblown","Many of the nail-biting scenes involving the book's protagonist, Alessandro, stretch the outer limits of credulity. And the book tends to drag on just a bit too long. Also, many of the best scenes end abruptly, failing to reach a satisfying emotional climax. Some great writing and compelling moments but, overall, somewhat disappointing."
4,The saga of a man's life in war and peace,"At 860 pages, this novel is somewhat shorter than Tolstoy's War and Peace, and somewhat less complex. The novel covers a man's life from his early years as a student, to his final days, with emphasis on his service in the Italian armed forces in The Great War (aka, World War I) and the effects on his later life. The novel is mainly set in Italy, but strays into Austria-Hungary when Alessandro is a prisoner of war. The author waxes philosophical, and the novel takes some time and effort to read. Like ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" characters are whitled away as the war progresses.You will meet some interesting characters along the way, including the senior clerk in the War Department who revises orders to suit himself; the Austrian Field Marshall who captures Alessandro; and a wide variety of other people who pass through his life. This was the war that destroyed a generation of young men for very little purpose."
5,One of the great novels of the 20th Century,"I have been a student of the fascinating, senseless, apocalyptic Great War for the past three years and I thank God that I serendipitously found this book on a bookshelf at a beach house a few years ago. It now holds the most prideful position on my shelf. Helprin's writing is beautiful and poignant like a haunting Beethoven melody or a Monet canvas. The story is so powerful and filled with so many penetrating insights that one finds oneself re-reading sentences or whole paragraphs immediately after finishing them.The ending is like no other (I know that sounds trite, but I'm not Helprin). I wanted to cry but I was too breathless, overwhelmed and in awe. ""Soldier of the Great War"" should be required reading in a 2Oth Century Literature course, and will some great director PLEASE buy the rights and make it into a movie--just don't screw it up."
5,Still in love after 8 years....,"Very few books merit a re-reading by me...Eight years ago I read the first edition hardcover of this novel. What a beautiful book! La Tempesta, a picture central to the tale of the book, adorns the book jacket. I have re-read all Helprin's novels, stories and fables over the years, they each hold a cherished spot in various bookshelves throughout the house. This was the last book to be re-read. I thought about it many times but my resistance came from a sense of not wanting to alter or destroy my first reading of the book. It was too wonderful and exquisite. The second time was more so, a more profound joy and understanding. This is the finest book by the finest writer writing today. I am still appalled when I mention his name in ""learned literary"" circles and there is no response or recognition, not appalled at the lack of taste and depth of most readers, but appalled at their loss for not having read this author."
5,"A rich, rewarding book -- outstanding fiction","I had never read any of Mark Helprin's work before I picked up ""A Soldier of the Great War."" After finishing this wonderful book, all I can say is that apparently I've been missing out. Helprin has created a book that will move you to joy and sadness, and that will remind you of why you love to read. It is a truly great novel.What will stick in your mind each time you put the book down are the compelling characters. Helprin has concoted a wonderful cast to populate the world of his protagonist, Alessandro Giuliani. From the mad dwarf Orfeo, to the Austrian princess hidden from sight, even the smallest characters in the book will leave an indelible imprint on your memory. They seem like real people, and that's hard for any writer to bring off consistently. Helprin manages it effortlessly.If you've come this far in the amazon.com site, you're obviously considering reading this book. Do it. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Average plus, too long, and a bit slow.","Too much prose. War is properly treated as Hell on earth. Subjects and relationships are adequately done. The plot moves albeit quite slowly too much of the time. I think another writer might have said what Helpern has, in half the pages. I skimmed more than I normally do in a book of this size.I really wanted to love it, but for the above reasons, I can only say I liked it a little more than average. Let me add that I mostly read mystery thrillers with a classic, or at least, a book that makes me think and enjoy the prose thrown in every once in awhile."
5,Viva la Ficcion!,"This novel is a treasure...a beautiful, rich tapestry of storytelling. How can you not fall in love with the dreamful, passionate (too much?), mountain-climbing, painting-admiring, war-surviving, introspective, extroverted Alessandro? The author pushes his narrative to the brink of ridiculous impossibility, but he never falls over the cliff. Wonderful! This was my first Helprin book, and it surely will not be the last."
5,Beautiful,"I first read this book several years ago and it's one of the few that has had a profound effect on me. The story the prose, if you haven't yet this book cries out to be read. One of my top ten favorites of all tyime, and I'm starting to get long enough in the tooth for that to mean something."
5,The Best Novel I've Ever Read!,"...I am even more astounded now by people who didn't like Soldier of the Great War. It is simply the best book I've read in my 49 years. I'd guess that people who didn't like the descriptions of WWI have never been in a war, and those who thought the physical feats too fantastic probably have no idea what is possible when a soldier is gripped in the terror and surrealism that is war. In my opinion, Helprin should have the Nobel prize for Literature for this book. The sweeping descriptions and detailed mindscapes are incredible. I bought five copies of the hardcover edition, one wrapped copy for myself and the rest to give to friends. Give a copy to every high school student you know. Maybe we would then grow a society sick of war, and gloriously seeking peace and love."
5,A book of breathtaking beauty by a man who was born to write,"Newcomers to Mark Helprin should not be daunted by the length of this book, which is a paean to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the power of love. Helprin's brilliance defies description. Once, when I was teaching language arts in a middle school, I was moved (by this book) to write him asking what advice he would offer to young writers. I have never forgotten what he said: ""Throw the ending of your story like a rock into the water--and swim out to it."" The swim out to the rock in this book will take you places you never dreamed you'd go so effortlessly and movingly you'll be devastated when you must at last close the final cover. It is the work of a genius"
4,Common sense parenting!,"I have been caught in between being too strict and being very lenient and I think my kids were getting very mixed messages. This book finds a middle ground which allows us to have healthy, loving children who are polite and disciplned. Instead of swinging from one extreme to another, grab this book and give it a try."
5,Gift,"My wife and I gave this book as a gift to her dear friend and she loves it.She is very happy with the content and the set up of the book. It gives little side notes and she is finding , although she know quite a bit about the subject , some new tidbits to further explore."
4,"A Good, Honest Approach","I found ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom"" to be an excellent basic resource for new seekers. Let's face it: the topic is a huge, slippery challenge, and any given chapter could be the bases for more in-depth research, but the Guide does a nice job of introduction. It also provides strong additional resources. Rather than ""airy fairy"" or even ""airy fairy faith"", I found the attitude of the author honorable, and his emphasis on service to others refreshing. I have students. Although I expect them to take the high road of academic Celtic scholarship, I welcome this Guide as a beginning step in their upward climb."
1,Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom,"Heavy on the author's personal philosophy, very low on actual content.The author spends far too much print telling the reader how he feels about ""Celticism"" and offers very little substance in terms of Celtic information. Sure, there's some information on Celtic gods and goddesses, and links to Celtic websites, but this text isn't worth the money. That is unless you're more interested in the author's personal philosophy and less interested in actually learning about the ancient Celts. Most of the text is fluff."
1,Way too expensive,$100 PLUS $25 s&h?!!? Are you kidding?? These people are out of their mind and trying to take advantage. Awful!!
4,"We are so glad to have you back, Mr. Holmes","While it is wonderful to have Sherlock Holmes back among the living, the real star in this video is the introduction of Edward Hardwicke as Watson. He is so comfortable and bemused as the teller of Holmes adventures that you believe him to be Watson. The screenplay is a bit uneven at points. It's almost as if the short story was unnaturally stretched to fill the time slot. But despite all that, Jeremy Brett is in top form as he keeps Holmes barely one step ahead of Moriarty's thugs and the infamous air guns."
5,He's back!!!,"It must be appreciated by fans purchased videotapes of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes that a viewer of from L.A. mentioned the former viewer's review. The Empty House is so excellent as a view from L.A. explained and there is no space to add in it. By the way, it well be a joyment for people intend purchasing this videotape to find out Holmes in the court. If you recognize Holmes disguising himself as a book seller in the court at a glance, you must be one of great detectives."
3,Oversentimental.,"Hardwicke is a good Watson at best just like David Burke. The former waxes sentimental and sometimes achieves depth; the latter plays dumb and sometimes achieves loyalty. This is one of Hardwicke's more vulgar performances, and one of Brett's too. (And his little speech about Moran at the end is full of gay affectations.)"
2,Too short!,"Jeremy Brett was great, but the episode was shortened to 50 minutes or so - much was lost. Would also like these episodes included in Prime at no cost."
5,Great Movies!,"If you like the Jeremy Brett/Sherlock Holmes movies, you'll like this one! But I rather like David Burke better than Edward Hardwicke. Anyway, Holmes is DEFINITELY not gay. I don't know what crazy people thought of that, but they can rant all their life and it won't change the truth. Holmes was merely admiring the criminal's intelligence, almost matching his own. I thought you didn't want Holmes to be arrogant?"
2,Not what I expected.,"When I received this bracelet, I was happy with the look. It was pretty and the photo heart was an appropriate size. Well, when I tried to insert the picture into the heart, it was next to impossible! A heart is not an easy shape to cut a small picutre into, anyway, but this was insane!! When I finally did get the picture into it, I could not get the plastic cover back on. When I did, it ended up looking really cheap. This bracelet was good in theory, just not good in reality. Next time I will buy a necklace with an oval locket!"
3,Spirits Woman,"More rank than I thought, the story line was good. The front states about prehistoric America but it's more like South America"
5,Romantico!!!,"Some of the best kisses of the silver screen play as Andea Bocelli sings Con Te Partiro - (For those not familiar with this song you'll recognize it immediately upon hearing it - especially if you ever watched the Sopranos.) This little disc sure puts you in the mood! I can't wait to play it on Valentines evening, candles, champaign, chocolate and Bocelli, ought to do the trick....After you've seen it a couple of times you'll notice how well the cuts are timed to the music, and how the clips build in intensity as the song crescendos. Very nicely done. It leads one to think of other great screen kisses, that didn't make the cut - or couldn't be licensed. It's a nice discussion topic for a Valentines night!"
3,Reads like a textbook,"This book bored me to tears. It reads like a text book, theres rarely an example. I don't get any explanation of what tools to use, how to set them up, or anything that i can actually work on while reading the book.For a 'programming book' i felt this fell way short.I did learn a lot of concepts by reading it, i just didn't learn any real C++ programming techniques, because they didn't give me enough background to get started in any compilers."
3,good for general information,"I have read about half of this book so far. I was very excited about this book while reading it because it does contain a lot of useful general information. However, if you are looking for actual code examples...this book falls short.I am writing my own game engine right now and I went to the book to use an algorithm it had listed...except the algorithm doesn't actually work! i tried to debug the algorithm for hours before giving up and writing my own. (Which was a good exercise in itself) Once again I turned to the book for an algorithm it listed, but the explaination of it was so bad I decided to write that one myself too.So...if you are a programmer already this book will be useful to you because the code snippets provided are less important that overall concepts which is why i bought it in the first place. But if you are a beginner programmer looking to learn how to code, I wouldn't recommend this book to you."
2,"Nice overview, but very few details","I guess I'm the kind of software engineer who likes to see code from time to time in my programming books. While the author does provide a decent overview of basic game techniques and algorithms, it doesn't flush them out very well. Buy it if (and only if) you want an overview."
4,1 book 2 stories,This book contains 2 christmas stories.The first one is called who knocks or christmas eve. It's about a poor showmaker and his sons who are very poor. While the father is away making shoes for a rich woman a vistor comes to the house. to find out who and why read this story!The other story is called The Little Nisse. This is about a farmer who is told to take care of the Nisse who lives on the farm. Read the book to find out what happens when he doesn't.
5,"MY LATE NIGHT REVIEW, AFTER EXPERIENCING TRIANGLE FEVER!","Trial by Basketball is the Slaughterhouse Five sports book. It's a fascinating history into Laker coach Tex Winters rise from garage band gymnasium roots, college sucess, the amazing Bull Run to current Los Angeles Laker status. As a Long Beach State 49er booster and renewed Laker backer, I recommend TRIAL strongly to fans from N.Y. to L.A. The authors unique style is a keenly accurate flashback account of Tex Winters classic career with insights into the world of sports and life as it is! A humorously intriguing One of A Kind Biography. The book equally satisfies the golden age Wilt Chamberlain transition era as well as the Rodman, Kobe X'er generation. ONCE YOUR IN TO IT, YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT--- MARK BENDER CLEANLY RUNS THE TABLE!------------------------ Linda Fallico-Coto De Caza, Ca."
3,"You're Not Going To Replace ""Slick Band"" Album With This","Because this CD contains many of the songs that were on the original ""Slick Band"" LP, I was excited to see this release. The arrangements on this CD are vastly different from those on the LP. A different lead vocalist was the biggest disappointment to me. I'd always though that Jimmie Mack's vocals were the perfect match to the music/lyrics. As much as I was disappointed after my first listen, this is still a good record and I'm glad I bought it-it's just not what I was expecting. But, as I first opened up the website, I see ""Slick Band"" is now available, compiled with Razor Sharp on an import release. I guess Amazon.com gets a little more of my money.........."
3,Leaves You Wanting MORE haha,"I love Steve-o. I'm a huge fan (and hope for more Steve-o Videos!). I do admit that this one isn't as good at the others, mainly because there just wasn't as much as the others. No special features with additional footage, and the actual run time of the video is only like an hour if I remember correctly.Even though Vol. 2 isn't as good as the others, it still is really funny, just not as long. But for the price they are asking for I think it's a fair deal [There's still some really crazy stuff that goes on in this! haha It's awesome]. If you're a fan of Steve-o, get it. It's worth having in the collection. You really can't beat five bucks."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I am a huge Steve O Fan and I Loved the 1st movie but dont waste your money on VOL 2..... its not even funny and it seems to me like its all naked women... so i guess its a good one for dudes, but I dont like that [junk]. IT DOESNT EVEN COMPARE TO THE 1ST..I doubt I'll even watch it again... what a waste of money that was."
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"... I ordered it once again at a discounted price. I was pretty psyched to get it finally and after watching it I felt compelled to crack the thing in half (or more). What a waste of my money - even for the [money] I paid for it. what I got was a commentary on where the tour went, how they got there, and half of a skateboarding video. I'm a big fan of the Jackass series - I think the concept is brilliant - but this Steve-o video wasn't even fun except for a couple of stunts. I watched some guy get beat up with a skate board and wondered why this scene was even in the movie. And the bathroom scenes were upsurd not to mention the destruction of a rental van that I didn't think was funny at all. Smokin' pubic hairs? not even close to being as funny as Pontius stripping/dancing in front of old Japanese dudes. Save your money!!! You might find that many others agree with me just by the number of Steve-O Vol.2 videos [online]"
5,Better than the first!,"The second Steve-O Video. This video is about Steve-O and his crazy tour around America. Performing crazy, shocking and hilarious stunts. Featuring Jackasses Wee Man, Ryan Dunn, Bam Margera, Preston Lacey and skaters like Ryan Simonetti and Preston Acuff. This has more stunts than the first and is guaranteed to shock you. This video also has tons of behind the scenes footage and more girls. Tune in to see: Ti*s on fire, Trash Cans, Steve-O's eviction party, more skating, rental vans being destroyed, lighting nuts on fire, breaking mircrowaves, the fireball stunt, and many more. If you liked the first, then you'll love the second. I never get sick of watching it."
4,God's Favorite,"well written and engaging, as it weaves facts with (semi) fiction. as someone from Panama, i have heard unofficial accounts of many of the story lines weaved in the plot,definatly worth the reading.geraldine"
2,Good but not reliable,I bought 2 units one f them after 4 months does not work any more so it's not that reliable
4,A more atmospheric Chapin album,"Although I don't agree that this is Harry's best album, it is certainly an incredible work. Perhaps because it came before my time. 'Taxi' and 'Dogtown' are really the only story songs of the bunch, a genre with which Chapin has really become identified and where he really shines. I've found that this album is definitely more atmospheric and somber than his other albums. It's a like a small voice that creeps into your mind rather than shouting at you. 'Empty' is a particularily somber and overlooked piece that I really grew attached to without really being able to explain why. Great album, but I would rate 'Dance Band on the Titanic', 'Legends of the Lost and Found' and 'Portrait Gallery' and possibly 'Verities & Balderdash' as slightly superior albums."
2,"Disappointing, thoroughly bland ...","Definitely not your usual Jude Deveraux fare. Has none of the humour and chemistry between the main players of the story that makes her books so heart-warming and unforgettable.Read it, but only if you have absolutely nothing to do on a dreary Sunday afternoon (or if you have trouble getting to sleep!). Don't expect to come away feeling satisfied though ..."
2,A very tiring book,"This book left much to be desired. Was very convoluted.Too much story line - Indians, San Francisco whore house,gay decorators, ranches on two opposite sides of thecountry, etc. Left me tired."
2,Not her best!,"This was the first book I read of hers, and I did not enjoy it. If I hadn't been interested in another one of her titles, I would have never read her books again. That would have been a big mistake...all of her other books have been really good! Unless you are a die-hard Jude Deveraux fan trying to complete your collection, don't bother."
3,Abridged Audio Version,"I listened to the audio tape of The Enchanted Land, and found myself confused by the apparent edits by the abridger. A typically wonderful Deveraux story line, but with too many twists that became distracting. It just jumps around too much. No, I cannot recommend this book in audio version. Buy the book..."
1,Don't bother...,"I have read a lot of Jude Deveraux & enjoyed most of it, but this book (originally published in 1978) is obviously an early near-fatal attempt at writing. Fortunately J.D. went on to more successful books, but this one is definitely not worth your time or money! If she would re-write it in her current more flavorful style, it would probably be fine. The descriptions are incomplete, the settings poorly described, the emotions difficult to follow. I've made it through 1/4 of the book & it's now going to hit the trash after reading the highly unnecessary rape. I read for relaxation & pleasure, not to be upset by violence or annoyed with poor writing!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,This is one of my favorite authors but this book lacked magic that her books have. Too much like other books nothing special.
4,Another Opinion,"I'm not one who likes to go into great detail on what the story is about, because you will see that on other reviews. But if I have enjoyed a book I like to let other readers know. So that hopefully they will find the same enjoyment I did.""The Enchanted Land by Jude Deveraux is kind of drawn out and full of historical detail, but doesn't take away the enjoyment. You will still find the story unforgetable. It's not my favorite, but the story has a way of drawing you in. You will love Morgon. She is what a lot of us would like to be like. Not because she's beautiful, but because of what she does for herself. Don't miss this one."
2,Wasn't my favorite,"I don't know how anyone ever finished this book. I've read almost everyone of JD's books, and she is by far my favorite author. But this book is hideous. The characters are flat and boring, showing no motives whatsoever for anything they do. I couldn't feel anything for Morgan or Seth. I couldn't even get past the first fifty pages. I wouldn't give the book any stars but for the fact that Jude Deveraux wrote it and I love her books. I don't recommend this novel to anyone, but try one of her others, like A NIGHT IN SHINNING ARMOR or WHISHES, those are pure magic."
1,"Characters not well-defined, stilted reading.","I love Jude's books, but this was a disapointment. Seth and Morgan were completely uninteresting until they parted halfway through the book. At that point, they seemed to come alive as characters, and I found myself rooting for Gordon to win Morgan's love. It did get better, but as I said not until they parted and that was over 100 pages into the book. I wouldn't recommend this if you've never read one of her books before, it'll give you the wrong impression. Start with one of the Montgomery books."
5,Great novel!,"A book worth reading. Definitely something that you should read when you have a whole day to spare. Even with out the Montgomery family, this book has shown that it can carry it self well"
4,The Enchanted Land,"Not sure why this got some of the bad reviews. Love makes us do crazy things and believe things that are not necessarily true until you become secure enough in your relationship and know what the other person is or isn't likely to do. They did go thru a separation, because she was sold, and he did believe the worst of her and think she had him shot. He did eventaully come after her, in the end. He knew what he wanted, and tried to make up for his mistakes, and fought for her. Writing an intersting book does not always mean making people perfect. If they were perfect we would probably think the book was boring. I thought it was great he picked what he thought was a plain girl for what she was, and like her, instead of picking a beautiful superfical girl, who would have been worthless as a wife. Thought it was a great read. Good Western."
5,Love it! Simply love it!,"Simply love it! It leaves my hair so shiny just as promised. I have curly/wavy hair, and it does a great job of taming it. I don't understand the reviews complaining about burning hair. It has an adjustable heat setting and the directions guide you on what settings are appropriate for different kinds of hair."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"This was the worst curling iron i've ever used. Even on the lowest setting it completely fried my hair. It gets so hot that the plastic top melted with the first use and my hair burnt off in chunks. Either I got the most defective model ever, or there is a serious problem with this product."
2,Disappointed,I'm extremely disappointed with this product. My curls didn't even last an hour. Unfortunately I threw the packaging out so I'm unable to return it.
1,TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE,"This curling iron worked great - creates long lasting beautiful curls for my fine straight hair. After 40 days of owning this iron, and maybe 15 days of use, today I noticed the coating is wearing off and my blonde hair is PURPLE! Unfortunately, I have missed the return window by 10 days, so Amazon will only give me a partial refund. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"
2,Not super Hot,It does not get as hot as I would like it too I have very fine hair and the curl does not hold and my daughter has thick hair and it does not hold sorry did not work for me I will be purchasing something different scale 1-10 and 10 being best I would give it a 4
1,waste of money,"Used this for little over a month-light use at that. It is clunky and does not have an automatic shut off. This was especially scary being that I plugged it in one morning and it started to smell hot, after closer inspection I saw smoke gently coming out of the on off button---I immediately unplugged it. I tested it out later and the same thing happened then stopped working completely."
2,Not happy,this product was sent without a box tho they say they are new.If I have a problem with these irons I have no warranty papers.I think I should have been informed that they came this way.
2,Great while it works,"Great curling iron, however this is the second one that has stopped working on me. I replaced the first one thinking it was a fluke, but the 2nd one is doing the same thing after less than a year. What happens is it stops staying on... if you jiggle the cord it comes on and off, but you can't keep the cord in the right place long enough for it to stay on. Very disappointing."
2,Heats up quickly but does not hold a curl,"The Good: Variable temperatures settings, swivel cord at the end, comes with extra springs, heats up very quicklyThe Bad: No automatic off feature, does not hold the curls for longer then 30 mins.I don't know if its because I have just asian stick straight hair but when i used the curling with hair spray before and after curling the curls didn't last that long. It lasted slightly longer then when I used a ceramic Conair curling iron but not by much."
1,Was good,Bought this in April because of the good price and my last one died after a year or two. Went to turn it on and nothing! 3 months it worked fine and now its dead.Time for a new brand.
4,Curls my uncurlable hair!,"I have really thick, straight Asian hair.I've never been able to curl it before with a curling iron... until NOW!Heats up quick. I learned the trick was to actually wait a little longer than my Chi straightener to get the best results. 2-3 minutes. It's hot in less than one but my hair apparently needs the melt your face off kind of heat that this iron is capable of."
5,"Amazing, I can't live without it.","The first one I had was not a ceramic one, it lasted me 7 years! And it only broke because I accidentally broke the handle. I've had this ceramic one for at least three to four years, and I LOVE IT. It is even better than the first and I can't live without it, it curls my hair perfectly every time. I also love the swivel cord, makes it easy to use. I didn't buy mine on amazon, but I should have it is cheaper!"
3,Good enough for the money,"This curling iron is nice. It makes big loose curls and that's what I ordered it for. The red light ""on"" indicator does not work. That was really the only problem, otherwise it's worth the money"
1,Doesn't work for me,"I don't understand all the rave reviews about this curling iron... it simply does not curl my hair at ALL!I even tried it on the highest temperature setting, held tiny chunks in for around 30 seconds each, and you can barely even tell that my hair was curled at all. Within 20 minutes, my hair is almost completely straight again.I've had probably a dozen or more curling irons in my life, and this is the only curling iron I've ever used that doesn't curl my usually easy-to-curl hair.Maybe I got a dud?"
2,Not that great a curling iron,Curling iron is VERY heavy especially if you have very long hair. It also doesn't heat up to the 430 degree setting it has.
3,Whats with the cord?!,"All the hot tools reviews have the same electrical cord malfunction. I myself have blown through two that same way. Great curls but ya, doesnt last too long. What to doooooo?"
2,Great until the materials break down,"I bought mine 4 years ago and it worked great while it was in good shape. Hadn't used it for a while and took it out today. The plastic coating has become both brittle and gummified! Whatever I touched stuck to my fingers and some even broke off. I had to throw it away because this just isn't safe to use any longer. I hate having to throw away something so expensive, but there was no way it was going to work and would have to be totally replaced."
1,COATING PEELED AWAY,Used this for only 2-3 months then the pink coating started coming off and leaving brown residue in my hair. Couldn't figure out what it was until I looked under the underside of the curling clamp. Contacted Hot Tools who said they would send me out a replacement. Too bad since the iron curled my hair really nice.
3,Loving this curling iron,"Love the curling iron, now that I have the size I was needing. Shipment was fast, but I found out the return process was a hassle. Make sure you order the size you want! I would be hesitant to order from this seller in the future if I wasn't absolutely sure that I had the size/style/etc. correct."
2,cumbersome-coating coming off,This thing doesn't handle well at all because the handle is skinny and the barrell is heavy. Also it just doesn't get as hot as any of the other tools I have. I'm just discovering that its not the company because I bought another smaller one that works fine .I should have returned this particular one and I cant suggest it to anyone.edit 9/4/2012: The coating is starting to come off under the clamp. I've only used it 4 times. I would suggest getting babyliss instead.
1,Damages Hair,This curling iron is bulky and hard to handle. I bought it because of the ceramic tourmaline finish thinking it would leave my hair silky like my ceramic flat iron does. This product made my hair really dry. I only used it twice but probably won't use it again.
1,Didn't work.,"I was so excited to use this curling iron, because I had bought one last year for my sister in law. She had great things to say about it, but unfortunately when I got mine, it didn't curl my hair at all. I sent it back in, and I'm still waiting for my refund."
3,"its ok, until the ceramic burns off","I bought 2 curling irons in the time span of about a little over a year. The ceramic purple coating eventually burns off and fries your hair worse than a regular metal hot tools iron. The coating doesnt last long, if it didn't burn off the coating, this would be a good iron."
3,Paint may flake off,"I've had this for a year. It works very well. However, the purple paint on the barrel is slowly chipping off and it leaves little back flecks everywhere."
3,Coating comes off...,"I have been using this product since December 2008 and initially it worked great. However, recently the purple coating has started to ""melt"" way and the coating actually got stuck in my hair. NOT GOOD. Also, I wish the product had an automatic shut-off in the event you forget to turn it off - which I have. I have owned MANY curling irons in my life and this was pretty good - except for the coating that came away from the iron. I am not sure I would buy this product again."
4,perfect for my fine hair,heats up fast! getting used to it. this was my first experience with a curling iron and i really like it.
5,i love it,"I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good ,I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, goodI love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good ,I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, goodI love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good ,I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, goodI love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good ,I love using it, stays hot,,,,,, good"
5,Best Book I Ever Read!,"I got a copy of this book directly from the author. I read it in just two days! What a great story! The pace of the book was very fast and exciting, while being a very moving story. Now, I want to buy more books for friends and family. I loved the story. It was interesting, unpredictable and most of all, very well written. The characters were the kind that stick with you long after you've finished the book. I recommend this book to anyone who loves GOOD, no, GREAT historical fiction! Buy it and you'll see!"
2,"Pretty pictures, almost no directions","This book offers lots of well-composed shots of nice arrangements, but provides virtually no information about how to make them. Note that the book dates from 1999, so it's a little out of date as well. Not worth the money."
1,A Disappointment - Well Below Expectations,"Perhaps my expectations were too high? Martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new Best of Weddings book is superb so I thought that this book, although older, would be a nice addition. I was disappointed. Although the book was published in 1999, it seemed even more outdated than that. The flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in Martha's garden. For a more thorough view, I'd like to recommend 2 books in place of this one. Jane Packer's Fast Flower Arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice. For actual, technical ""how to"" steps and design theory, I'd recommend Judith Blacklock's ""Flower Arranging"" (might be called Teach Yourself Flower Arranging in some indexes). Once you know proper floral design techniques, you can use any kind of flowers (NOT just those from Martha's garden) to create beautiful arrangements."
3,"Useful, if sometimes contrived","Lots of ideas and clear, helpful pictures, although I was actually expecting a more extensive technical section - in the magazine MS has step-by-step explanations of how to create a wrapped bouquet. And there were no bridal bouquets at all in the book, only table arrangements! I also didn't like the ""Martha says,"" ""Martha prefers,"" third-person style - better to have written in the first person or objective perspective, wouldn't have been so distracting. Bottom line: a practical guide, but ignore the constant Marthaisms."
1,Arranging Flowers: How to Create Beautiful Bouquets,"There are alot of great pictures of arrangements in this book, but very little about the actual construction. I bought 8 floral books and this was the only one that disappointed. It does make a decent coffee table book, though. If you really want this book, buy the used copy. You won't feel so cheated that way."
2,Hmmmmmm.,pokemon gold is ok. i dont recomend it becuse i got bored with it after 10 weeks so unless you are the most serious gamer in the world dont expect a very good game.
2,Getting there...but not all that.,"PokéMon is nothing more than a decent RPG. Nothing speicial. I am NOT a PokéHater! I am a PokéWAKER. Someone that wakes ppl up from that stupid trance called PokéMon and into the world of a MUCH better RPG...Final Fantasys I-IX (1-9). I have VII(7) and, trust me, it's 30x longer than PokeMon and at least 10x harder than PokeMon. Compared to FF7, PokeMon is a PokePushover. It's WAY easy. So go peel yourself away from PokeFlop and power up 'dat PSX. Out."
2,didn't save,the save battery is dead. total BS. games in great shape other than that. just annoyed how little effort put into testing
2,Does not work!!!!,The game is so fun but it would not save I suggest (only if you own a ds) to get heart gold for ds same game better graphicshttp://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0038MVFYC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1338427430&sr;=8-1
4,childhood Memories,"Even though Im 15 now, I still own this game today, this was my first ever game in the series and its excellent in everyway, The soundtracks are amazing and if you've played this then you'll know how good this game is, anyway, If you have a fan of the series but has never even heard about this game, I highly suggest you get it for them, even though its an older one without wireless capabilites and wont work in a nintendo DS (you have to have a Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Advance SP to play this), you wont regret buying it."
4,Fun for All,"I got this for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I ordered it on the 23rd ad got it on the 27th, so I was pretty happy with the timing. It's a great game."
4,Pokemon Gold,"It's a fun game to own and play along with it's counterpart,Pokemon Silver. Only certain aspects of game play are negatives such as the time aspect and daily events as well as having to chase the legendary pokemon unlike in Pokemon Red and Blue. Missing certain events and having to wait literally a week sometimes to return to them is slightly annoying as is having to capture certain pokemon during specific times of day as they are in some cases specifically nocturnal or their percent in a given area is extremely low. Other than these things the game plays very well and the improvement to color from just a plain solid red or blue color is great. Seeing each pokemon in their given coloration is really nice. The added new types and moves are also a plus. Overall a well worth buy for a Pokemon fan."
3,game review,"Both Gold and Silver are good games on the whole, however they are unable to link with any recent versions of the game and thus are a little dated for use. The glaring problem was the version I purchased did not save the game data. (at all.) Certainly a good game on the whole, it can lose its charm after a while and can be a little frustrating when you can't find certain things in the game. Personally I recommend the newer versions of these games for all but the vintage gamers."
1,Not for the little ones!,"I'm sure this is a great game for older kids, but unless your 5 year old can read, try something else. There are a lot of written instructions on screen and the only way the little ones (4, 5, 6 year olds) can play is if you intend to sit side by side and play with him. (Not entirely a bad idea either.) But if you're looking for a game the little ones can play by themselves, look elsewhere."
4,a good game for people who like pokemon,"This game while it is fun when get it after you beat it it is not as much fun. The new features such as the day and night, the new pokeballs and the new types of pokemon the dark and the steel are a good but it could still be better. I think you should be able to fight with people who have the red,blue and yellow versions it just isn't as much fun just being able to fight have aganist people who have the gold, silver and crystall versions.It is also a pain when you trade pokemon I mean pokemon like pikachu who knows a move like zapcanon can not be traded with people who have pokemon blue red and yellow it gets to be a pain having to get my pokemon that I can trade to the blue red and yellow you have to go to blackthron city and talk to te move deleter to remove the move before you can trade it. Other than that this game is ok but if you have a game boy advance I would what untill pokemon advance comes to the usa."
3,hmmm...,a great fun game except for the save problem. When u by these games used the cartridges have a limited amount or no save memory at all because of the they were made a long time back. i got this game used off of amazon but my files would not save. i called eb games about it and they said that the save memory for these gameboy games lasts about six or 7 years.he suggested i keep my gameboy on till i beat it which kinda sux. just giving u a heads up . i only have one gameboy and wanted to play other games to. this might also affect my gameboy.
5,Much better than the previous Pokemon games,"This game blows Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow so far out of thewater it isn't even funny. Once you pop this [game] into your gameboy and start a new game it will ask you for the time and day of the week. Now, you may be wondering why all the fuss. But as you will find out this game runs by actual time and the funny but awesome part of this game is that certain pokemon come out at certain times of the day, and even week (also events happen at certain days of the week). This will make everyone that likes pokemon insomniacs thinking about the next pokemon they need to catch. Only downside to this game is that its still to short (besides the long periods of time it takes to get all the pokemon).......I was really hoping for like an awesome storyline but oh well. Get your hands on this title and play it non-stop!"
5,Good as Gold!,"Well, even if you didn't think the Red, Blue or Yellow versions were that good(Or if you don't really like Pokemon that much) Get the Gold and Silver versions anyway. There are 100 (251 Total) new pokemon (including new evolutions of old Pokemon like Scizor, the evolved form of Scyther), New and improved pictures of the original Pokemon, better graphics, new options, attacks, HMs and TMs, a new rival, 8 more badges (16 total), and a whole new adventure. On a scale of one to ten I'd rate the Gold and Silver versions a 1,000.Get ready for a whole new Pokemon Experience!"
3,PRETTY GOOD BUT PEOPLE ARE TO EASILY TAKEN,"this is a cool game i am going to buy it i am a fan of RPG's and i can't stand the hype that pokemon has created it is the most ridiculose thing i have ever seen pokemon the movie,pokemonthe tvsho,pokemon the computer. i think the game was fun and challenging and i had a good time and i sometimes experiment with trying to get the best popssible pokemon but give me a break people it is not that amazing the movie was ridiculouse and the card game could use some major shaping up in. so all ion all i am waiting to play because it's fun yah! but i am not drooling to get it so all you people who think pokemon is so amazingly amazing that the world would come down in fiery and dark apocolypse need to wake up and smell the snorlax"
3,used games,Don't buy used Game Boy games. This was the fourth one we bought. Everyone of them has been defective. The game doesn't save. It restarts every time.
1,NO SAVE,DONT BUY PRODUCT UNLESS FREE SAVE DOESNT WORK I WANT MY MONEY BACK! hORRIBLE DEAL GET ANY OTHER GAME NOT WORTH IT!GBHGR HTHH HYTHYYHT Y T YYHHYH HH
5,Pokemon Gold is like finding Gold!,"Pokemon Gold is awesome! It starts off that you are like Ash, and have to pick a pokemon, which is Grass, Fire, or Water. Then you have to battle you revil! It's like pokemon red/blue/yellow/green but the grapfics, and for Game Boy Color is awesome! And you can go on trains, shop in walls, do lots of things in Pokemon world! This game is great! It's hard trying to get 251 now! There are no bugs in the game, and this game as the old lands too! Man, I can't wait to get the game for GBA when it comes out with new lands and more pokemon! This game has it all!Grapics/Looking Animation, awesome! The best it could be for GBC! 10/10Fun, are you kidding me? THIS IS FUN, PURE FUN! 10/10Gameplay/Movieplay, Pokemon, well Pokemon lasts forever! 10/10Sound, I LOVE THE NEW STATIONS! 10/10Overall, perfect, I rather have this game, then 1 million in Gold! 10/10=My 2nd perfect in 19 reviews! :D 5 GOLD STARS!"
4,"This Game is better than Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow","This game is better than all the other Pokemon adventure games! The enhanced graphics and yes, all the original pokemon are in it. There are even new options the the game! Like PokeGear, your cell phone, Togepi, and much more! There's still more when you finish beating up this group that looks like the elite 4 cause you can still go to the old world. Remember, you are NOT Ash, everybody in the New Pokemon Games (Pokemon Gold, Silver) says how bad Ash beat them up. In this game, you get more Pokemon and it's even harder than the old games!New challenges, new Pokemon, even new ladders in the caves! There's even new HM's!In the begginning of the game, you can even get a Togepi! Buy this game! It is worth the money(wait til this game is translated if you wanna buy this game)"
1,They had me remove my first opinion,"I bought this game for my hubby and when we received this game it was great, but would not save. I was told I would get a new one, I did, my money back; I have not. And extra money returned for the inconvenience; I have not. So I'm posting this to warn everyone else: you buy this game and it doesn't work, well you're s.o.l. It's not gonna get fixed."
5,Awsome game,"this is a good game i bought it in a shop and now a 2 weeks later i am almost done. dont get the idea that it is eas its not i just have played ith before it has many nice features like. certin events happen at a certin time. new pokemon, new gyms. NEW WORLD!!!"
3,Think about it for a second,"I'll start off with this, I am not by any means a Pokemon fan. I hate the show and believe that nearly all of those mutated things with their trainers and merchandise should ....There, now you can see that I don't like this Pokemon fad at all. I played Red and Blue, and they were good, yes they were actually good. They may [stink]when it comes to TV programs and merchandise, but this franchise is popular for a ... good reason. These games are by far some of the best RPGs ever made for the Game Boy. The monsters may look like something some Japanese artist cobbled together in his sleep, and yes they have ...names that only 7yr olds care about pronouncing, and yes, the whole fad behind this is incredibly huge and anyone above age 5 has good reason to hate, and fear it. These games are good, and this is much better than the first two. The new monsters are very stupid, but the games are pretty fun...."
4,"An Amazing Improvment from Red, Blue and Yellow!","This game is much better than Red, Blue or Yellow! The graphics have improved greatly!You are no longer a tiny little Ash character, you are now a lifelike character. The character anmation is amzing and now there is battle animation!The only bad part is that it's takes forever to get items like Pokeballs and when you've found them you've already missed the chance to catch alot of pokemon."
4,Scary...,"...I first heard of Diamanda Galas more than 15 years ago, and before her music I knew about her outspoken nature. I read in a magazine about how she wanted to f--- a man because she wanted one to know what it was like to be raped. Okay...a few years later at a conference about AIDS she proclaimed one of the big problems about the disease was she couldn't get laid easily anymore (though someone else on the panel said he'd be glad to oblige her).Anyway...the shocking blue madness of Galas conceals the woman's skills as a vocalist and a musician. This live recording catches her abilities well, with a few subleties and a lot of fire.Hearing ""25 Minutes to Go"" done like this was taking a classic blues song and turning it into something like Dante's Inferno. So bizarre, so twisted and yet you understand somehow.This is surely not for everyone, but the diverse material and Galas' handling of it impressed me."
5,"If you hated ""The Singer"", then this is the one for you","After ""Panoptikon"", ""The Litanies of Satan"", and the ""Masque of Red Death Trilogy"", many felt betrayed by Galas' release of the piano-voice setting of ""The Singer"", sensing in it something like a commercial swerve toward more mainstream music. Whether or not this was true (one could hardly blame her for wanting to finally earn enough rent money for once), with ""Malediction and Prayer"" Galas revisits ""The Singer's"" spare simplicity of piano and voice, with complete success. The stunning quality that I remember from the Singer tour, but which seemed almost entirely absent on the album, is here captured with total effectiveness. You may safely disregard ""Tired's"" review below. And if Galas' other music is just too far out for you, then steeping yourself in the total performances of this recording will help you to begin to understand why Galas has such a devoted following."
5,intimacy and power hanging over your head,"perhaps the most accessible album Diamanda has done. M&P starts off strong with ""The Iron Lady"", a song which captures you with its bluntness and truth/cruelty. The high point on this album is Diamanda's version of ""The Thrill is Gone"", her banshee wailing that begins this track frightens you into heartache. Following in the tradition of her album ""The Singer"" Diamanda performs with all the power of her voice and piano. Few can listen to this album and not me disturbed one way or the other, and for this reason it's perhaps one of the best albums released this decade."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a total beginner and this book unfortunately failed in what it promised to do, whichis teach Java to a total beginner from the ground up. A future updated version, shouldalso offer a video instruction version, where what's written is spoken and shown via video."
1,Not for a beginner.,"I recently read Beginning Programming in Java for Dummies by Barry Burd. That was a great book for a beginner.....this book is not. I was going to try to make it through the first 100 pages before looking to another book, but I've fallen about 30 pages short of that. Nothing is explained well in this book and it seems like he is introducing aspects of Java that don't belong in an introductory book. He succeeds in confusing more than instructing. Should've spent the money on something else, and I'm certainly not wasting any more time on it."
4,Dark Shadows Lives On,"The only part of this portion of the series (I have 1-4 and preordred 5 and 6) that i have issues with, is that some of the episodes are poor in quality. Also, you can watch one episode in color and the next one is Black and White.(Mostly on Series 3) Otheriwse I highly recommend this for anyone that is a Dark Shadows fan. I've also just realized that the word Vampire isn't used (or I missed the rare occassion), but they say ""The Un-dead"". Strange"
3,West of Bliss,I really liked the directional series by Suzann Ledbetter. I was disappointed in West of Bliss because it just ended. Now we will never know what happened to Hannah and David.
4,Fun,I read this many years ago when I was probably around 12 years old. We had a copy in the house which probably belonged to my father. I remember enjoying it thoroughly and reread it. I think I'll reread it - I believe I still have a copy of it on the bookcase.
4,amderson,"Again Mr. Roth takes along time to say a bit, he isn't as good at it as Wodehouse, but he does have it times."
4,AWESOME!,wonderful photography and illustrations. Very interesting information and stories. A must get for lunatics.
3,Sherlock Holmes: The Sign of Four,This was a typical and satisfying Sherlock Holmes mystery but unfortunately it was somewhat convoluted and confusing especially in the denouement.
2,Pointless,"This second Sherlock Holmes novel, in which Watson falls in love with the client but still attempts to reunite her with the fortune that will separate them forever, has been rather unlucky in its screen adaptations. The first, in 1932, was a hyped-up vehicle for Arthur Wontner featuring fistfights, motorboat chases, and a peroxide Mary Morstan. This one was made in the middle of the Granada TV series and has two crippling problems. The first is Jeremy Brett, at the beginning of the illness that would take his life, and consequently losing his looks, voice, and presence. The second problem is that the central romance has been eliminated -- and without it, the whole point of the story (Watson's chivalry) is entirely lost. Stick with the pre-1987 titles in this series."
5,One of the best,All the Jeremy Brett renditions of Sherlock Holmes are good. This particular story of a treasure that brings death from a one legged man and a pygmy is more interesting. We follow Holmes as he meets a young woman that catches Dr. Watsons eye but has a odd story to tell of her fathers death. We then find that the meeting of an acquaintance of her father has the police arresting the wrong man. Holmes with the aid of the Baker Street Boys searching the Thames leads to the capture and confession of the true culprit but an incredible telling of the whole history of the treasures change of hands through theft and murder. The DVD copy has a clean picture and the sound is good. It is well worth owning.
5,excellent,excellent source of the early years which i have not found in other books on a truly unique person in so many ways
3,cool,i dont understand how to use it! but i will learn its a old product. but you pay for what you get. for the price i will figure it out.
4,FORM WORKSHOP 600 LG,"Received item very quickly and in perfect shape. Not being computer literate I have no idea how to use it, but was informed it was a great program. Item was purchased for a friend."
2,GOOD ITEM,THIS ITEM WAS BOUGHT FOR A LAPTOP THAT I HAVE FOUND IN THE TRASH AND THE BRACKET WAS BROKE I BOUGHT THIS TOP PEACE TO SOLVE MY LITTLE ISSUE .WAS CHEAP TO BUY.BUT NOTE:BE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR LAPTOP IF SO THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU IT IS A DIFFERNET COLOR WHAT YOUR COMPUTER MIGHT BE BUT IT WORKS.DOES NOT COME WITH SCREEN JUST A BRACKET.
4,Just a clarification...,"Another reviewer complained that this wasn't really ""the best of"" Todd Snider's work, since it doesn't include songs such as ""Vinyl Records"" and ""Statistician's Blues,"" et al. I agree that those are great songs, but they were released on John Prine's independently owned Oh Boy! label, not on the MCA-Universal mega-conglomerate, which is the company that put out this particular collection. Yeah, it would be great to have all of Snider's ""best"" work on one collection, but I for one am rather glad that Universal doesn't own Oh Boy! so that that is not possible... But if you want to check out Snider's early work, from the albums he put out in the mid-to-late 1990s, this is a fine single-CD option."
4,Todd Rocks as Always,A great review of Todd's work. Most songs have a bit of a twist from the norm. Good stuff!!
5,He's an Allright Guy,This is a nice collection of songs and styles. I really like all of it. It is my first Todd Snider album but it won't be my last!
1,Spelling and grammar,"First off, I don't know how my Amazon.com search led me to this interesting item. However, I do know that I was intrigued by the picture so I clicked it to see what it was all about.My next step was to preview the first page of chaper one. In about 30 seconds I found two crucial grammar mistakes, which are so very rudimentary they led me to believe that the entire book will be s***.Thanks.Bye."
3,Obey,"I liked the books, but the story line could be alot better. I bought the first 3 books in this story and wouldn't mind getting the others to see where the story goes, but pretty expensive."
2,cats did not like them,"I think when it comes to cats its hard to tell what they like or do not like.They absolutely love the plastic spring toys so I thought these would be almost the same, just a bit more durable than the thinner spring ones...which have somewhat short life span due to those sharp cat teeth!no luck for my Bengals.so this is not a negative review of the product as much as a heads up ;-)"
5,A Surprise Hit!,"You wouldn't think these simple little plastic curls would make even a mild-mannered cat act like a fool, but they DO.You know how cats go nuts for the plastic pull off the milk/water jug? These are made on the same principle but stronger and more to hold onto.The beauty is in the simplicity. (Like how cats usually like the BOX the fancy gift came in instead of the fancy gift...and would rather sleep on a dictionary than a 100 dollar bed.) Big cats and little cats both liked it. And you can't beat the price. Five paws-up."
2,Well made however...,"Save your money. I thought my cats would love these seeing as they go crazy for the rings from milk jugs and for ponytail holders, but no...they ignored them and my dog ate them. Save your money and give your cats milk rings instead."
2,Just o.k,My cat just doesn't play with these too much. She will swat them every once in a while but just perfunctorily.
5,OMG My Cat goes gaga for these!,"I've tried all kinds of cat toys and wasted a lot of money on toys she's played with a cople of times then never touches again. Then I bought the looney loops and oh boy she absolutely loves them! She chases them all over the apartment, bats at them, and loves digging them out from under the couch. She plays with them so much they no longer resemble their original form and I had to throw them away they were so ratty in shape. I went into panic mode when my local store was out of them and didn't get them back into stock for ages. Then I found them online! I bought a whole bunch so I wouldn't be caught without any of her favorite toy. I don't know why she loves playing with them but she does! I highly recomend them!"
2,cats not impressed,"My two cats were not impressed with these. Granted, they are older cats and don't play with much in general, but they are still cats that like to bat things around here n there. Just had no interest in these. Stick with milk jug cap rings. They love those."
2,Not For My Two Cats,Bought these because of all the glowing reviews. My two could care less. I do see them in different places sometimes in the mornings but it's usually only about 1 roll from where I left them. At least I don't have to hunt them down or order more because they lost them. Ordered different kinds of these but they dissed all of them. Cats.......
2,not a bad product but...,"...my cats just dont like them. i thought they'ld love em since they the love the Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs. Go figure. You get 3 lousy Looney Loops for $5 + they barely gave em the time of day. But the pack of 10 Ethical springs for less than $2 a pack they cant get enough of. Theres nothing wrong with the looney Loops, you just cant predict whats going to tickle a cats fancy."
2,My cat ignores these,"My 16 mo. cat loves her springs, so I thought I'd try something different, but similar. She just looks at these and ignores them. I will be getting her the springs from now on."
4,Something my cats actually play with,My cats love the milk/water jug cap rings but they're harder to come by these days so I picked these up. They're not as light as the cap rings but they're light enough to not whack your cat in the face too hard if you toss it. I can tell my cats would prefer something a little easier to pick up in their mouths (like the rings) but these are a decent alternative.
5,Cat goes Looney for Looney-Loops,"One of my cats is extremely fussy when it goes to toys. He likes his mice, but he is always tearing those up. I have tried many others but he just walks away from them. Until I found these. He goes nuts. He is always carrying them around in his mouth. Then will drop it and start batting it around. When that one 'escapes' he goes back to his basket and grabs another. His favorite thing to do is go into an empty bath tub with one of these. He can spend hours in there playing.I highly recommend these. They don't shed, they don't fall apart, they don't break, and they are completely washable!"
1,Kitty was not impressed,I found these at a local pet store but my cat won't play with them at all. She just stares at them like they are aliens from Mars. Some of the best things in life are free (sort of). Here's a tip to save you some money. Pull the ring off your milk container or orange just container and flip it off the counter and watch your cat go wild! My cat loves 'milk rings'. Her all time favorite toy above anything I have purchased that is an actual 'cat toy'. We have them all over the house. Bottles of vinegar have a nice wide loop to pull off too. My kitty loves them because they fit so well under anything she can bat them under (like the furniture or the refrigerator).
5,Awesome old-school industrial from Chicago,"This is Acumen(Nation)'s best album next to Territory=Universe. If you like industrial with horror movie samples, buzzsaw guitars, and tribal, pounding drums then this album is for you. Songs like Matador and Gun Lover make me want to go into a frenzy. If you are a fan of Burn-era Nine Inch Nails and Ministry you will surely dig this. All the songs are good and worth repeated listens. They even recorded this at Chicago Trax, where many Wax Trax bands like KMFDM and early Ministry albums were recorded. Bottom line, if you like guitar-driven industrial with dark synths, and eville vocals then this is totally a must! Also get More Human Heart and Territory=Universe. Avoid 5th Column and Lord of the Cynics...they are mediocre. Check out Iron Lung Corporation; they are an Acumen(Nation) side-project / members from Clay People. Awesome stuff"
5,Fantastic Theory for Editors,"I first bought this book over 30 years ago when I was learning to cut film. It helped me make the jump to real editing, then better composition and directing. It even helps writers. This is a must have book for anyone in film. My last copy was stolen while I was in film school. I have been searching out of print shops for another copy since 1977. At last, another copy."
3,Why are some of the world's largest international companies translating the Rukhnama into their own languages?,"If you interested in the Rukhnama and its impact on Turkmen society you should check out this new documentary called SHADOW OF THE HOLY BOOK, which questions why the Rukhnama has been translated in to forty languages, paid for by some of the world's largest corporations; Siemens, Daimler-Chrysler, Caterpillar, John Deere, Bouygues, among many others.SHADOW OF THE HOLY BOOK exposes the immorality of international companies doing business with the dictatorship of oil-and-gas-rich Turkmenistan.Shadow of the Holy Book"
2,Basic information for men; but old-fashioned message.,"As an expectant dad I found this book easy to read and adequate. It reviews the basics: your wife's changing mood, sex, labor, c-sections, etc. If you're in the dark, this book will help lighten things up.However, the book is written in an old-fashioned tone. The pregnant woman is always referred to as either ""your wife"" or a ""girl."" Also, its expectations of fathers are quite low: be patient, don't sulk, be nice. The message seems to be: ""You're used to getting your way, but now you need to compromise just a bit."" For a sexist guy, this book could be of some help, but for the sophisticated man Naomi Wolf's _Misconceptions_ is much better."
2,I am posting this video on eBay now!,"I can't recommend this video! There wasn't enought ""meat"" in this video to provide much of a yoga workout and the instruction needs improvement. The instructor's voice and annoying cadence was enough to make me toss the video."
3,Not bad if you have a mute button,"If this is not your first yoga tape, you'll find nothing new. The poses are basic- downward facing dog, cobra, warrior 2, etc. That said, the combination of poses is an effective stretching workout.The instructor leaves a lot to be desired. As noted in many other reviews, she talks incessantly. What is most disturbing though is I constantly feel like she's laughing at me! It's not paranoia, she literally giggles through the whole workout. ""This part should feel G-O-O-D!!"" she says, then adds a snort that implies ""Heheheheh... suckers!"" Worse yet, she follows the laugh with a quasi-erotic moan and yet another giggle. As soon as I learned the routine well enough, I hit the mute button and was pleased with a gentle routine for my slow, lazy days. It's certainly not the most challenging video you'll ever face, but decent for stretching exercises."
1,Learn With Yoga Zone Instead,"I gave this one star to be polite, but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga, and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement. The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes, frankly), not teaching YOU how to do it properly. I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes, starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.& Tone, Tot. Body Cond., and Cond.& Stress Relief, among others. I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes. Learning yoga is a wonderful thing. The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations, and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
3,"good concept, poor execution","The good: The bird feeder is nicely designed - feeds many birds at one time and - so far - has kept the squirrels at bay.The poor: The feeder was slopily assembled. I had to loosen 8 of the 12 feeder covers and straighten them plus the bottom was put in crooked. For the price, this is not good. Also, the perches, listed in specs as 7"" were actually only 6 1/2inches(meaning there is a 1 1/2"" perch on each side of the feeder, which is 4"" in diameter). Cardinals had a hard time on the short perch. I contacted the company for longet posts - was told they do not sell longer perches. I bought a 1/4"" aluminium dowell and cut longer ones. Everyone is happy now."
5,Birds love it,I have come to the conclusion that my birds are Droll Yankee fans. This is my third of this brand in various sizes. They will empty them first before moving to any of my other feeders. I think it's going to have to be my go to brand forever.
3,12 year old feels good in the morning,"My 12 year old arthritic black lab, Keela, feels good in the morning after she's slept on this bed. It's a good height off the floor so she easily maneuvers onto and off of it. The cover comes off and is machine washable, which is essential! Unfortunately, the foam insert seems to be sagging already in the middle, so I'm concerned about how well it will hold up in the long run. I'm hopeful it will last for my border collie and golden retriever to inherit, but am growing doubtful of that. I will say that it seems to be making my sweet old girl much more comfortable in her old age, and that's the most important thing!"
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!!!!!! A+++++++++++++++++++,"I have owned these beds for a few years, but did not think of finding this product on Amazon where I could write a Review for others until just now. PLEASE....If you have an arthritic dog and they need more attention to comfort for laying down, consider this product. They wash beautiful....They wear wonderful and our Great Dane has lasted I know years longer because of these beds provided for her. Kristine Casteel Michigan"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I love Carlin's early work and am always amazed at his incredible, phenomenal timing. Since I'm from New Jersey, I couldn't resist What Am I Doing In New Jersey. Unfortunately, it's really not that funny. Carlin just seems to be going through the motions, relying on old formulas. He's not enjoying himself. There's no room for this one in my collection."
5,Leimert Park's Griot,"I personally grew up musically in Leimert Park. The first person I met was Kamau Daaooud at The World Stage in Los Angeles,CA. After all he is one of the elders of The Village. I was taken by his robust, deep voice and the manner in which he delivers his spoken word. His voice reminds me of some of the old preachers in the black churches and how they inspired the people. I've had the pleasure and honor of performing with him through the Pan Afrikan People's Arkestra. I personally own this book. If you are ever in the Los Angeles area, you have to see him live. He also has an album with some of his gorgeous pieces, it's called Leimert Park. He's an inspriration to both hear and read. As a human being, he's a kind and gentle soul. It's fully conveyed in his work. If you are looking for something to open your heart and spirit, check him out. I promise, you won't regret it."
4,Pretty amazing - Please read before buying!,"This Gripp Ball works great. When you FIRST get it, you'll feel very weak. After doing it for about 10 minutes, you'll start to get a strength immediately. So far, it's a great product. If your a bassist or guitarist, be sure to try this out. It's only 5 bucks, but it's really great."
3,"Cheaply made, but you get what you pay for","It was fine, as pictured, I guess, but my bras didn't really fit in there, and it looked like some leftover packaging from something I had purchased in a store, so I ended up throwing them out."
5,Best pictures of China,"Insight Guides typically have incredible pictures of the locations you may be considering visiting. This book on China is no exception. It has colorful and interesting photos of the people and the land. If you are looking for a guide book with a lot of recommendations on accommodations and what to see and what to avoid incorporated into the text, this may not be your choice. Insight does have travel tips, but they are in the back and may not be as convenient as you would like. Still an excellent book and recommended."
4,Big time album here,"BOOGIE PEOPLE by GEORGE THOROGOOD AND THE DESTROYERS is a big time album from someone who has been bringing us some great music for over 20 years now. IF YOU DONT START DRINKIN, BOOGIE PEOPLE, LONG DISTANCE LOVER are original Thorogood compositions that just totally rock and are reason enough to buy this album. NO PLACE TO GO, SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD, BORN IN CHICAGO, HELLO LITTLE GIRL are tunes that also rock the house and shows us some of the bands influences. However, the true gem on this album just might be another original Thorogood composition, OKLAHOMA SWEETHEART. It is a country ballad that fits in perfectly on this album. It is a gem that the listener will truly enjoy. I think everyone reading this should go out and buy this album now."
2,"Not worthless, but close","This album is bad. Has one great; no GREAT song on it ""If You Don't Start Drinkin' (I'm Going to Leave)"". The rest forget it. One GREAT song gets 2 stars- buy the single mp3 & forget the rest."
4,Stylish Graceful and Sophisticated,"Getz was already the grand old man of the tenor saxophone when he recorded this. His sound is beautiful and still unmistakable Stan. He's got nothing to prove and plays with a superior grace. Fair to say, after all these years, there are few surprises, but who needs them when he plays like this! The recording quality is excellent, the band plays superb and in particular Jim McNeely's piano playing is a delight (check out his solo on Antigny). It makes this ""late evening-red wine-and-candellight"" disc even more worthwhile"
5,Excellent pan for the money!,"This pan is typical of Cuisinart quality. Weighty and well made, it cooks evenly and has a professional look. It cleans up easily and is an excellent value. To the reviewer who complained about the ""non-stick"" not working...this is NOT a non-stick pan."
4,Pantastic,"I understand why the first reviewer was confused the picture shown makes the pan look like it has a non-stick surface. I'm thrilled with the performance and the price. This is one of my first higher quality stainless steel pans. Unfourtunately, the very first time iIused it I burned some oil in it and have already left a hard to remove burn stain. If anyone has a solution please let me know."
1,Strongly Disliked this pan,"I'm a foodie not a noob and even I couldn't keep this pan from scorching . I'm glad to see that no one can purchase it , it was not worth the price."
2,Very dissapointing,"I purchased a bunch of Cuisinart pans to replace some aged Cephalon. I generally love Cuisinart appliances and read uniformly good reviews.I do very fancy cooking but the ultimate test in always eggs. These pans do not heat evenly, they smoke and their 'nonstick' is not great. I have pans from Wallmart, I can't remember the brand, in my vacation house and they are better than these."
4,"Not quite everything, but it definitely multi-tasks","This pan is a little large and heavy, but makes up for it's bulk by searing everything perfectly, and taking the place of my wok. It also doubles as a crepe pan, which comes in handy about twice a year. I end up using my saute pan more often, but this is a good back-up pan, as well as my primary pan for large cuts of meat."
5,Really inexpensive,"HI,I've been in the military most of my life and just recently retired.I really like to have a flag attached to the post on the walk-up. I have bought so many flag sets, it's crazy--many of them are polyester, some have posts that can't stand Chicago winters, and some are even made in China!!!This Ace Bracket is the best that you can buy. It's brass, so, it can stand up to pretty much any kind of weather/stress. The company also has links to their flag choices (all are really well made...never had a tear in mine}. This is the best that you can get. I looked at the ones at the big box stores and they sold theirs for about%50 more.BTW, you have to have a damn good drill to get those brass screws in (or a good neighbor that can help you out).I hope that I helped you find the right bracket.If so, please click ""yes"" on the button below.All the Best toYou and Yours,RL MilesSSgt, RET. US Army"
4,breath of fresh air,"I love this CD. I love Katie's voice and I couldn't disagree more with the other review that I read here, so I was compelled to chime in. While living in NSW Australia in 2004 I fell in love with the band george, and waited with great anticipation for the solo CD of the lead singer. Unfortunatly I think I'm like one of 10 people in this country that know how wonderful and refreshing these songs sound.A little something for everyone here, and I find myself remembering the melodies and hooks to these songs quite well, thank you very much. Perhaps Aussies are taking Ms. Noonan for granted? Well I see the CD is seling well on the ARIA charts, so maybe it isn't as grim as I think..Katie I would love for you to give it a go and release this CD in the US, yea? Well, either way I'm loving it from afar."
5,Centaurs and Drunkards,"If you are sick and tired of the same old ""Puffed"" up whack-wannabe-hip-hop ride the Centaur for a while. Buck is a legitimate poet. Whether he is describing his mythologically expansive parts, or describing a baseball game from his teen years, he is bending and carving his words like a master sculptor. I hadn't really heard any of Buck's work since his transition from ""Stinkin' Rich"", and quite honestly I was floored. This guy is the real deal. Just check-out the complexity of his beats. Damn! It's no wonder he has been bubbling at the surface for the past couple of years (i.e. teaming with Biz Markie to open for the Beasties, and butting heads with Doc Octagon, a.k.a. Kool Keith, to pump out the vinyl). A definite steal if you can get it! Look for The Greek (the drunkard) at the start of track six! Aum!----The Greek"
4,last language artist,"Simply put, there is little hip-hop that can match Buck 65 for ingenuity or craft. Even his lyrical near misses surpass the competition's best. You owe yourself this."
2,not that comfortable^^;,many people said this shoes is very comfort but it wasn't for me. I feel little....I don't know.... it is little narrow and the heel is not balenced?????
1,Poorly written and inaccurate,"I found this book to be trite and poorly written. It did not allow for good character development. The ""players"" were stereotyped. The topography and general situation of the Big Bend were inaccurate and exaggerated. (I speak as one who lives here and has hiked the trail described.) But I do not usually read ""romances"". This may be pleasant reading for those who enjoy this type of literature."
3,The brand is great but the flavor didn't go over well with the mutts....,I love this brand of dog food but the pups just didn't like this particular flavor....
2,How embarassing for the best RTS line in history,"Yeah, if theres one thing that i find extremely boring, it's commanding only one unit, pointing where i want him to go and who to attack, using absolutely no skill or strategy whatsoever, and collecting retarded pick-ups only to find out that some gaywad with a T-Rex comes along to stomp on my mammoth tank. WHAT A GAYASS WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This game is not worth your money people, seriously, but everything else in the Command and Conquer line is more than worth it."
4,Ritter is funny as always,"This movie is great, plain and simple. I've watched John Ritter since his days on ""Three's Company"" and loved the physical aspects of his comedy. This movie finds a small measure of that toward the end, but it's still got some great moments throughout. Well worth watching!"
5,Smart Girl Movie,"Awesome! I give this movie 5 stars...Nicolette Sheridan (Alex) was just wonderful in this off-beat pick as the beautiful small-town wife of goofy plain looking author John Ritter (Carter). The main reason she married him is to have an opportunity for a better life. After all Alex has no family or resources to help her. She only has a husband who wants to have everything his way. Although I don't agree with murder, the husbands are not innocent either. Even John Ritter (Carter) is not innocent in the way he treats his wife the beautiful Nicolette Sheridan (Alex)."
2,Help!,"Can you provide the Sound Track? Failing that, can you provide the name (and source) of the Yma Sumac cut?Thanx."
3,Complexity is everything,"I've found this book rather ""scientific"" than for practice. It is reserved for the professionals. If dingy sailing is only a past-time hobby for you, I would not recommend it."
4,Fantastic musclecar book - especially for a Hemi fan,"The contents of the book take one back to the very beginning of the street racing scene during post-war America. It only gets better as you turn each page. A must have for a gear-head of any brand - Ford, GM, or Mopar. The author does sem to favor the 426 Hemi as his favorite engine; he doesn't come right out and tell you, but you will get the picture not even a fourth of the way into the book. The only issue that I had while reading my book cover to cover was the cheap build of the binding/spine. The glue separated from the spine and looks awful now. Keep in mind that I do not bend the ever-living-daylights out of my paperbacks when reading, in fact I take great care NOT to crease them. This book however, was not built to quality standards. Do not let this detract from the plethora of hisory and horsepower within the pages of this book. Enjoy."
2,It's okay...,"Just don't rely on this book for all your info. The diet is complete BS. No refined flour or sugar? A bagel is a treat? I like the Q & A format but little else. For sound medical advice, I found the Mayo Clinic guide to pregnancy great. For fun reading, the Girlfriend's Guide. For quick reading with some neat pictures, Pregnancy for Dummies. Overall, it's a good companion piece to a pg collection."
4,Exhaustive and informative but not very inspiring.,"This was yet another of the many books I read in pregnancy but I am an obstetric anaesthetist so have a good knowledge of problems in pregnancy already. I am surprised that this book has provoked such vitriolic reviews although I too prefered Sheila Kitzinger. I thought that this was actually a reassuring book for people who do get complications in pregnancy and the chapters relating to such complications were sensible. I am afraid I have little sympathy for people who object to the eating dogma (everything on your fork...!!!) cos believe me, if you are like me and put on too much weight only a few pounds of which disappears at birth then you too will wish you had considered each forkful a bit more carefully!!Overall I think people would be well advised to combine this with a more ""naturally"" orientated book but that if used in combination with other sources it may well be useful."
3,"The classic, but beware...","This was the first book I ran out and bought when I found out I was expecting. Like several other reviewers, however, I found it to be somewhat intimidating, since it focuses quite extensively on problems in pregnancy and less on what is actually happening to one's body and to the baby. Still, it is an excellent book, but I would urge people, especially firt-time expectant moms and dads, to be prepared and to read other, more positive sources, like ""Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week,"" which I find much more comforting!"
1,Fear-based and mysogynistic,"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. Pregnancy has the potential to be an amazing time in which you can connect to the power and effectiveness of your own body. These authors seem determined to frighten and pathologize you for the normal, healthy, and miraculous event taking place in your life. Having read literally hundreds of medical studies, I can attest that the ""doctor knows all"" philosophy which is so rampant in the United States (although not in the 22 countries with better birth outcomes) is misguided. Do yourself the favor of doing a little research of your own, and steer clear of this fear-based book. Better-educated authors include Sheila Kitzinger, Penny Simkin, and Gayle Peterson. (Hint: if you're interested in the pregnancy and childbirth literature, look up books by Henci Goer. She summarizes the literature clearly and accurately.)"
1,Misguided and horrible.,"For anyone experiencing a less than perfect pregnancy, this is a horrible and upsetting book. I shared passages with my OB/GYN during my high risk pregnacy and she was befuddled regarding some of the advice offered -- particularly the comment about needing magnesium sulfate to prevent CP in pre-term births."
1,how to expect THE WORST,"It's informative, I'll give you that.HOWEVER..This book has scared the living daylights out of me. Is this twinge I'm feeling the onset of eclampsia?!! Is the fact I was overweight when I conceived REALLY going to be the end of both me and my unborn child?!!??Honestly, some of the things written here are akin to scare-monger tactics... maybe I should just kill myself now?some of the info is good, plain and simple.. but it's a bit hard when you're having a sleepless, seasick night, and decide to enlighten yourself on your symptoms and come away even more freaked out than when you began.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. And neither does my sleep-deprived husband."
2,"Useful as Reference, Harmful as Guide","Yes, everyone should have this book, if only as a detailed reference resource for everything that could conceivably go wrong with a pregnancy. However, the tone is condescending, the ""facts"" are tempered with neither reason nor perspective, and the overall attitude seems to be: 'If something goes wrong, it's ALL YOUR FAULT' (e.g. the ""best odds"" diet).By all means, use this book. But unless you feel the need to take orders, or have the confidence to read without immediate self-doubt, do yourself a favor and get a book that will support you as a prospective parent and human being (e.g. The Hip Mama's Guide, or Dr. Sears' book)."
1,a very frightening book,"I bought this book on the morning I took my HPT test, and gave it back to the book-store the morning after. I felt as if the most exciting thing in my life has turend out to be a very dangerous and frightening one. This book describes each and every problem that can occur during the pregnancy, and it is certainly not the welcome I was expecting. This book really frightened me, and since it didn't contain much useful medical information, I decided to give it right back to the bookstore. I suggest not to buy it, especially if this is your first pregnancy."
1,I do not recommend this book!,"I did not like the way the book seemed focus on problems that can occur - for example, there was a brief discussion about a problem that occurs in 2% of pregnancies. Well, if there is a 98% chance that it won't happen to me, I don't want to start worrying about it now! Also, I have always had a relatively healthy diet but when I read the following quote I had to laugh - ""Before you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider: 'Is this the best bite I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If it'll only benefit your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put your fork down.'"" Talk about pressure! If you stress yourself about about every forkful of food, I believe that the stress is probably worse on the baby than if you had allowed yourself to have that handful of M&M's! I enjoyed the 'Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy' by Vicki Iovine much more, and supplemented it with informative web-sites, my Doctor, and childbirth classes."
3,Better guides out there,"Not my favorite pregnancy book. Yes, there's a lot of practical pregnany info, but there's a lot of filler and unrealistic expectations. They advise mothers-to-be to forego sugar for the entire pregnancy. They also present a host of genetic diseases that will convince you you're baby is doomed. Go for the Girlfriend's Guide instead."
2,Book is missing vital information - read this!,"Many women experience vestibulitis after childbirth, a painful vulvar condition that can be treated by an OB/GYN. There is no mention in the book of this condition or to see your physician if intercourse is extraordinarily painful even weeks or months after having a baby.Also some women break their pubis (pubic bone cartilage separates) making walking almost impossible after having the baby. I did not expect to have difficulty walking and to need extra help weeks after vaginal delivery.The book should at least mention these. I thought I knew what to expect after reading the book but with this info missing, I really didn't."
4,Sony TV stand,"this item manual talks about using some screws that are not provided with the item, nor were they provided with the television! Not sure how you are supposed to find them. I called Sony and tried to get them. They sent me what was supposed to be the two screws, but it isn't the right item. We just used it without these screws and it works fine. I just think it would be more secure and distribute the weight more evenly if we had them."
1,Not worth a penny,"This book contains 63 pages of nothing! Nothing worth paying 14 dollars for! It contains a bunch of simple melodies in different modes and basic scales. You'll learn to play chromatic harmonica whole lot more if you studied with a basic theory/scale book and a song book of your choice (mine is ""essential jazz standard"")."
1,Chromatic learning curve,Book is OK if one wants music theory defining various scales. Most beginners want to play songs. Hopefully I can learn to play my CX-12 via another book. Anyone have suggestions?
5,Simple and powerful-- worth the read!!!,"There are no gimmicks here; just sound advice and straightforward questions for helping uncover what it is that keeps each of us from enjoying a satisfied and successful life. In five quick and easy steps, Pat Lynch leads us through a simple and powerful process for taking control of our lives and getting out of the box that we all create for ourselves.If living the life you've always dreamed of is important to you...buy this book and read it today!"
1,Not worth the time,This is a small book with very little content. I did not read anything that would change my life in any way.
3,A Good Introduction...,"I bought this book for an introductory college course in Anthropology. I found the book to be very comprehensive almost to a fault. The author chooses to talk about very very basic subjects leading up to an idea in anthropology. The book is wonderful as a guide to an introduction, however if you know anything about anthropology to begin with I would suggest reading another text. The text offers great information on primates, by far my favorite part of the book. A great book for beginners by every means."
4,Well represented!,"I thought the book was well represented and in the condition that it was being sold as. Also, can't complain about the price. I bought this book for school, and it came in a short amount of time. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase."
1,A lot of Evolution...,"Being a Christian, I hated this book. I needed to read it for collage, but found it a complete waste of time! I know alot of people love Anthropology, but I thought it was a complete waste of time. Only read this book if you truly believe your ancestors swung through the trees."
5,Fantastic!!!,I used to watch this show all the time growing up!! I wish they still had something like this show on today. I think my favorite part of the show was the end when they sang the goodbye song...I am 25yrs old and can still remember almost the entire song!!!
5,My Kids Love This,"My two oldest children ages 22 and 24 grew up with Sharon, Lois & Bram! Now my 2, 3 & 4 year old are watching it too! They love it in the car... you can hear a pin drop when this is played. Great for all ages... My 8 year old sings along too!"
5,love!,Just as I remembered! A huge part of my childhood that I'm so happy to share. I hope they release more on DVD!!
4,Skinnamarink TV episodes,"I was looking for episodes from the older TV show, ""The Elephant Show"", but could not tell from the description given which show this DVD came from. It turns out that it is from the newer ""Skinnamarink TV"" show and includes three episodes. This works for my purposes, although I still prefer the older show and will continue to try to find episodes from it. My 4 year old friend (for whom I bought this DVD) really enjoys these episodes and we sing the songs together often."
1,2009 and still this product is defective...,I Just received a new and sealed copy of the 2 disc set. Fortunately both discs were included (I gather many only received one) but the 2nd DVD is horribly defective with only about half of the bonus material able to be accessed. It seems MPI Home Video have not done a very good job of recalling the bad product and replacing them. BE AWARE!
1,Ronald Reagan - the Great Communicator - Complete Set,"I purchased this set for a Christmas gift - it was supposed to be a 2 disc set - only one disc is included - after several attempts, and 3 replacements from Amazon that still only have one disc, I am asking for a full refund - buyer beware."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"All I got was ONE DVD, I thought I ordered the complete set. They sent me another set, but it still only the first DVD. That was over a month ago (and I was supposed to return the previous one I had, but won't until I get what I paid for.) and this site is so stupid that they don't have easy to find areas to contact. So maybe this review will wake somebody up so I can get what I paid for, before they lose me as a customer. I am starting to get extremely ticked!"
1,Ronald Reagan set,"I have had to send it back twice. Once because disc two was omitted from the set. Second because when disc two finally came it was severely defective. Please do a better job of checking the materials you send for completeness and lack of defects.Unhappy customer, Bruce Henderson"
1,Doesn't Compare,"Doesn't compare to others.Sorry, but a lot of speeches pasted together is not something even a Reagan fan like me wants to watch. The Tribute to Reagan or PBS DVDs are both a lot better."
4,After a long time!,"When Aaron Nason and his wife Minnie first approached me to create a web site promoting his new CD, I wasn't sure that I wished to listen to it. I had grown up during the Big Band era and haven't progressed much in music appreciation since.I haven't bought a CD in over six years---nothing seemed worthwhile. In order to place sound clips on the web site, I had to listen. Whoa! I liked each and every number.On great little number ""Hangin' Out"" is different. In the list of credits for the performers is a curious entry: ""Frogs - Themselves"" In California's Central Coast region, when it finally decides to rain, the frogs that have lain dormant in the bottoms of seasonal wet spots, come to life. The sounds are pleasant and loud. The produces decided to open the recording studio's door and included the frogs. It's a pleasant addition to a great performance.To summarize, I liked all eleven tracks and recommend it to anyone that likes funky Jazz."
5,"Expressive, Insightful, Creative, Innovative drum-n-jazz","This album, along with Squarepusher's Hard Normal Daddy, and Amon Tobin's Permutaion, make a great collection of jazz-influenced drum-n-bass. No other electronic artists (besides me, and maybe Spacetime Continuum) capture the true improvisational essence of jazz like these 3 guys. All 3 afore mentioned CDs are incredible works, and will move your mind just as much as your body..."
4,Excellent first album from the innovative Mocean Worker!!!,"I used to HATE electronic music. But it's guys like Mocean Worker that truly make you appreciate the creativity and originality of the genre. I picked this album up because I read good things, and boy, is it good. The first track, ""What's Wrong"", is a beautiful start to this album and is just a preview of the immense amount of variety and skill that Mocean Worker puts into this album. Why 4 stars? Well, it ain't perfect, but it's extremely close to it. If you're a fan of a lot of different music styles, you'll definitely dig this album, and if you like it, his second album is definitely worth picking up, although it's not as awesome as this one is. Highly recommended; mad props to Mocean Worker!"
1,"Poorly organized book, unlike an encyclopedia","Organization: Hodgepodge. Try reading this book if you want help falling asleep. If you want to learn something, take it from an intellectual: Read the World Book Encyclopedia rather than Britannica or anything associated with it. Britiannica makes learning boring and difficult, just like nearly all professors."
4,1984 with a twist...,"Think of 1984, then put a ""happy"" face on the inhabitants existence. Everyone is happy and thankful for the computer that runs their lives. Except for one man who seeks the truth. In my opinion, this tracks more closely to what is going on in the United States than 1984...it's ominous without the gloom."
4,"""Save game"" problem is user error, not software bug","I talked with someone at Aspyr Media, who said they had gotten a lot of calls about the ""unable to save game"" bug. It's not really a bug, I found out--it's what happens when people try and save their games to the CD-ROM! He said this happens when people try to play the game from the CD, and not from the hard drive. Hope this helps!"
5,Technical Support Needed,I have not been able to play this game due to the fact that Snow Leopard is apparently too new an operating system for the game. Perhaps I will be able to find an old Play Station and finally play the various Tomb Raider games.
1,Very misleading,I looked up this game on Amazon. It said it was for MAC. When I got the game it wouldn't load on my computer so I contacted customer service at ASPYR. They told me it wouldn't work on the new MACs. Nothing was said in the description about not working on the MAC OSX. Very misleading. I wouldn't recommend any game from ASPYR.
2,A Mind of It's Own. Ugh.,"You must have the CD in to play! Not very cool. Although my biggest peeve (and main reason for 2 (instead of 3) stars) is that every time this program is ran it changes appearance settings and messes with resolutions.Yeah, I should've paid more attention to the description. I'm really not interested in buying and owning software that is nearly a decade old. But alas..."
2,Does not work with Current Mac version OSX,"Beware, this product does not work with the current version of Mac OSX and there is no update on the companies website."
4,More than I expected for such a small unit,"Have owned for about 2 months now and am pleased with purchase. Use nightly for 10 to 12 hours to play white noise recorded on SD card, daily to play TV audio with my small projector, and ocasionally during day to play music from SD card or listen to NPR. Will take 2 GB SD card without problems. Does a very good job for such a small unit. Works well on FM, internal and external (SD card) memory, and line in. Volume as expected is lower than a larger unit. Only complaint is the lack of AM radio and a remote would be nice."
2,COBY SHMOBY,"This thing was about what I expected, but I had hoped for more. The button functions are fairly unclear, couldn't figure out how to turn it off for a while. It eats batteries like fat kids eat cake. FM radio is virtually useless due to poor reception. This is old technology by now, so do yourself a favor and buy something else unless they are giving these away."
4,Hoping for More,"A deftly woven web of intrigue that unfolds in 18th century London and Paris. The heroine's sensitivity to and training in the needs of the deaf enable her to win the confidence of a frightened mute witness to a crime and solve the mystery of her stepfather's death.The vivid background descriptions capture the ambience of the period and pull the reader right into the settings. The cobblestone streets, the elegant castle interiors, the lush landscapes spring to life before the mind's eye.O'Brien's erudition leaves its imprint in the authenticity of the novel's historical context; the social injustices of the time and even international politics are interwoven in the plot.The budding romance between the strong-willed heroine and a chivalrous nobleman is allowed to develop just far enough to whet the reader's curiosity about how their relationship fares. One hopes for a sequel!"
4,Topical in many ways,"Harold Gray sure put Daddy and Annie through hard times during the Depression.Although Warbucks almost gets hold of something which could end all depressions,the capitalists and New Deal advocators ruin any chances of success.Learn how Warbucks and Annie met Punjab,discover another of Annie's animal friends(Pee Wee the elephant),and find out how unfair life can be sometimes to even the best of us.The endearing quality Annie has is that she never loses hope even when things are at their darkest- as they seem to be a couple of times in this book. Yet the dawns are glorius."
1,This book is defective! BEWARE!,"Fantagraphics made 5 Little Orphan Annie comic strip books, from 1931 through 1935. The first 4 are excellent, but someone at Fantagraphics made a terrible boo-boo when they did 1935. ALL the strips in the entire book are in the wrong order! The Monday strip each week follows the previous week's Saturday strip, and then is followed by the Sunday strip on the next page. I talked to someone at Fantagraphics about this gross publishing error, and they told me that they were NOT planning to reprint the book with the strips in the correct order! The existing book is virtually unreadable because of Fantagraphics' uncaring corporate decision, and this is undoubtedly why Fantagraphics never did any more of these books beyond 1935. The other earlier books are fine, but avoid this one at all costs. The new ""Complete LOA"" book #5 published by the Library of American Comics has the beginning of 1935, and in December #6 will come out, which will have all the rest of 1935."
1,OMG!!!!!!,"I can defenitly say, I learned aleason buying this product. It is the most hideous shower curtain I have ever seen in my whole life! I would save it and give it to someone as a git, but I cant imagine who would want it. It looks beautiful in the picture,but trust me once you see it n person you will wonder what was I thinking. Do yourself a favor and get one at he store instead."
2,Poorly Done,"The good side of this book is the writing style. It is moody, and the descriptions are interesting. On the other hand, the characters are shallow and not rememberable. The story is confusing, unbelievable, and jarring. The author attempted to tell the story from five different points of view without clarifying when this switch between people was made. The character's voices are not distinguishable from one another. The author draws you out of the main story line several times to tell you pointless back stories on other characters. Dokey's novel Beauty Sleep has the same flaws. Her best in the Once Upon A Time series is The Storyteller's Daughter and Golden."
3,Changing a classic,"While as always well written and entertaining as ever, don't read this book expecting it to be just like the opera it is based on. Several character names and personalities have been changed to suit the authors needs and style, and the acutall opera base is only three chapters long. The book though is an interesting with a happy ending that is expected, though the scenes taking place in Hell are a bit rushed and grow a little boring. I thought the most interesting part was the begging before the prince enters the picture. Over all, a pretty good book."
4,"Nice, inexpensive.",I purchased this as I have a new table and all my old ones did not fit. It is not as lavish as some I own but the color goes well with runners I put on top and it has been washed four times with no problems. Comes out of the dryer needing just a touch up.
2,Save your money,This book isn't much better than freely available online documents on the same subjects. The book suffers from the usual problems of a book with too much level content and no practical hands-on information -- Architecture with out practical solution or a prototype model is constructing a building with out foundation. The authors explained individual topics to the extent that it is even confusing. I found this is the last book to be used for quick reference. This book is quite useless to me and I am a googling around for better information.
4,solid and timely,"Web services are an evolving technology for machine to machine interoperability. What's frustrated me is that books in this space seem to be either too narrowly focused on programming platforms or quickly dated. This book is a breath of fresh air: it's up to date and deals primarily with web services as a technology rather than a bolt-on. In my opinion, this is the current book to own for starting to get your brain around web services. It stands out as being very useful to me as an architect."
5,sick and funny,"This show it not only funny but very insightful. It combines comedy with brutal truth. It is a little slow to start off but after that he gets in to his violent humor which is what makes the show. His bit about Mickey mouse is great and very, very filthy. This tape is perfect for a long time Carlin fan but if you don't know his work to well it is best to go with Best Stuff which is a bunch of short clips from most all of his acts."
1,Waste of money,"Why spend nearly $3 a bottle, when you can go to the grocery store and get the same exact bottles with beer in them for just around $2 per bottle?"
2,"Yeah, well stay away from this vendor","Well, I bought the book last minute and it got here in time for the class. The downfall...the quality was misrepresented and I didn't have time to return and order another. Should have been a poor rating - entirely way too much water damage from front to back. Looks as if someone dropped it in the bathtub while studying."
2,Lacking and outdated,This book is very outdated. It often uses deprecated elements and lacks any valuable examples in the CSS and layout areas. I am amazed my school makes us use this book. It isin great need of a re write to bring it up to date and needs a comprehensive CSS and layout section.
3,No Bad Overall,"The book was OK as far as it went, but a little simplistic - not as much value-add as I would have liked."
4,Good read,"There are too few magazines devoted to waterfowling, and I'm glad this one is there. It's a good magazine. No magazine can fill all voids, but this one tries. I would like to see more history and less ""how I spent my vacation"" articles."
5,Warm and wise,"Great read, very carefully wrought story that packs an unexpected emotional sock in the gut. The author is also very funny."
5,"A delightful, cheering, profound story of family love","I had the great pleasure of reading this book after it was recommended by a friend, and now I wish to return the favor and recommend it myself. Wintle writes with an easy grace, and fills the story with rich moments of life with a teenage girl -- chapters turn on a dime from comic to poignant to tragic and back again -- just as a teenage girl's emotions can turn.Tiffany is one of the most compelling and engaging charcters I've ever read -- read it for the true insight you will gain into the mind of a young woman full of talent and promise and, yes, a few problems -- she is as lovely and complex as only the best young women are."
4,Sweet,"I bought this on a whim. It was pay day and I was bored, so I decided to get it off Amazon (and because I'd read a brief review in Cosmo) but I'm glad I did.Uncle Eddy - a gay forthy something New Yorker takes in his 13 year old neice, Tiffany who id feisty yet vulnerable. The tale is of their time together - their battles but in the end you realise just how much they love each other.It's not deep Lit, but it's poignant and touching, all the same."
5,A Book for the whole family,Loved this tale of an uncle who finds himself with his hands and his heart full with a feisty teen-aged niece. He displays such a wonderful love and respect for his family --- particularly his parents. His love of family is palpable. One hopes that the kind of love and understanding displayed by Uncle Eddie would be available in their own family. Only a gay man could put into such expressive descriptions the feel of being a New Yorker. I have an idea that we will be seeing Uncle Eddie's book up in lights in the not too distant future as well as that feisty and talented niece of his. Hopefully a sequel is in the works with Tiffany's continuing years in High School.
3,"OK, but no ""Suzuki"".","Granted that ""Suzuki"" was one of the greatest chillout albums right at the peak of this kind of music, I wouldn't have expected Tosca to do another album like it. This indeed is no ""Suzuki"", but in more than one way. It's no ""Suzuki"" because it's somewhat experimental, sticking a foot outside of their comfort (chillout) zone, which is good. In that sense, I like it better than their previous ""Delhi"" or what Zero 7 pulled off after they peaked back in the early 2000's.However, the album lacks that something that makes you want to go back to it. At times it sounds like Robbie Robertson's work, but without Robbie Robertson. Only a handful of songs stuck with me. I am hesitant between 3 and 3.5 stars, so I will give them 3 stars, mostly for trying to stay on the edge of innovation. However, it's not an album to particularly die for."
5,Another Excellent Effort!!!,"Not much to say but ""AWESOME"" with Tosca's J.A.C., standing for Joshua, Arthur and Conrad, the names of Huber and Dorfmeister's recently born baby boys.They put their heart and soul into this new album and it shows. So far, I haven't been disappointed with Tosca's music and this one is no different. Just plain cool music. Light up a spliff and enjoy.Cheers."
3,Not their best work,"Stylistically, this album pretty much continues along the same road as everything else Tosca has done before it... and that may very well be the problem. It sounds very routine and generic, as though the members were just going through the motions, and the worst parts of the album border on warmed-over jazz-funk that could just as easily have been done by Lionel Richie (a common pitfall of the downtempo genre as a whole).I loved ""Suzuki"" and liked ""Dehli,"" but ""J.A.C."" is a disappointment. Tosca definitely need to come up with some new ideas."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Definitely not as good as the first volume. Partly because you know more about the characters, I think, and they were basically settled after the first volume. This one throws in a voluptuous jungle queen style heroine for Tom to dally with, for one, but still quite enjoyable overall, even if the focus is taken off the more interesting characters from the first book."
5,Wonderful,"This book, illustrations and story and characters, are so intriguing it was impossible not to become involved with their adventures and pprogress. Perfect for new readers!"
5,Quite possibly the best book ever written,"Negative comments in other reviews all relate to the reader's preexisting expectations of the novel based on some shallow comparison to U.E., for example. I will not insult the quality of this novel with this sort of comparison. Pick it up. Read it. For those accostomed to reading Dan Brown, this will take more time and effort on the part of the reader, but it is worth it. This book has the potential to alter your world-view."
5,Surprising...,"For a multi-author story this is a surprisingly coherent and fascinating book. Great historical fiction, somehow reminded me of Eco.Check out the website of the authors for more information: http://www.wumingfoundation.com/"
3,Politics in the Protestant Reformation,"""Q"" provides a highly politicized view of the Protestant Reformation from two points of view: the letters and diary of the Vatican's secret agent known only as Q, and first person narration by a radical Anabaptist who goes by many names. The book focuses on the events surrounding the Peasants' Revolt, the siege/slaughter of the Munster Anabaptists, and a final ""endgame"" between the two main characters.Throughout the book pretty much all Anabaptists/Baptists are (unfairly) broad-brushed as a cross between followers of radical liberation theology (socialism, class warfare, etc.) and a doomsday cult. Doctrine and theology is really only used as a means of furthering a political agenda. This is certainly a fascinating portrayal of a turbulent time in history viewed through the lens of politics. However, I was a bit disappointed that it turned a time of great spiritual importance into little more than a political power struggle."
4,"smart, but art?","I can't get through this. It is impressively researched and detailed, and there is a mysterious identity, but I can't care. Nor about the joint mysterious authorship. This is a genre novel really, imitating Eco, obviously by more theoreticians or historians, and there is a cinematic quality to one of the speakers (the other you slightly skip his stylistic toadying). But not a real vision. (Incidentally Eco bores me as fake too.)"
5,Life changing experience.,"This novel is extordinary. The extravigent story of a young man going through his college years suffering from the loss of his father trying to reach out and find comfort in Jennifer and himself.At times this book made me laugh out loud, and other times drew tears from what he, and everyone has once lost. This book helped me through the hard times in my life, and inspired me to help less forcunate people. Now I know how someone feels,when they say a book changed their life.I expecially enjoyed his refrences to the Chinese philosiphers. And a quote I will never forget ""Thus an excessive love for anything will cost you dear in the end."""
2,Whaaa?,"Someone JUST passed this copy of part of the story on to me- the author sent it with a textbook- and I have to say that I couldn't even get past the first photocopied page. I found typos, wrong spellings, the word ""really"", like, eighty million times, but worst of all: I had no IDEA what in the world I was reading!!! There were maybe three long paragraphs on that page and they maybe discussed how the narrator was maybe halfway kinda unsure of himself, sort of (to paraphrase). I was so completely unimpressed that the editor in me started marking up the pages- but then my friend said, ""No- wait! He's already actually PUBLISHED this and is selling it!""So, the only reason this book doesn't get one star is because the title of the book is cool. If I were the author, I'd start again from that point."
4,Almost Perfect Godzilla Sampler,"The CD has cuts from most of the early Godzilla movies. There's nothing from ""G. vs. Sea Monster"" and one short cut from ""... Smog Monster"", which is too bad. But most of those themes which were running through your head since your childhood viewing of the films are here, including the ""Mothra"" song *and* the lyrics to same! There are a couple variants themes from films (e.g., G's theme, Japanese army/Monster Zero march) but most are unique. Some are good, some sappy. Ends with bouncy modern rendition of ""G's Theme"" by Neil Norman!"
5,GREAT buy!,Great songs from the movies we love! The only one on here I consistently skip is the Megalon track...that one sounds silly....
4,Brings back memories of when I was a kid!,"This incredible collection will really bring back the memories of those of you who, as kids, enjoyed Godzilla movies as much as I did. All that campy music, and even some other classic selections like the ""Mothra"" song are on the album as well as some classic Godzilla roars. I had the album playing when my wife called-""what's that"" she asked, ""it sounds like a Godzilla movie!"" And she isn't even a fan! It's more recognizable than most pop music groups. A must have for Godzilla fanatics."
4,Great cd for Home Movies!,I was needing some background music for my home videos and this cd didn't disappoint. It was perfect!
4,Adorable boots,"I just got these for my little friend and they are even cuter in person, seem very well built and fit perfectly. We just bought her 2 other pair of shoes this weekend, both 7 1/2's and these boots were 7 1/2 and fit just right. Won't know till winter how well they'll hold up though."
3,mling,"I bought this for my daughter and she loved it. She said it was very comfortable and the only problem is the size. She normally wears 8 1/2 and I already bought a 9 for her, yet it's still a bit tight on her, but she seems to manage."
1,CI Consultant,Not current edition or 1 step below. This was an original release. The product was too old to use.
3,Dissappointing,"I was very dissappointed with RT Essentials. I had been using and administering an older version of RT for some time, but when I upgraded to the current version I thought I would benefit from reading this book. There are a lot of new features in the later versions and this book just barely mentions them. I had the feeling that it just almost told me what I wanted to know, but not quite. I would very much like to see an expanded, more detailed more comprehensive edition. I think it would take a book twice the size of the current edition to do RT right. I want complete tutorials on writing scrips, using templates, using custom fields, using saved searches, etc."
1,a deeply flawed text,"While an important contribution to the literature on the history of the Cold War, a shocking number of production errors marrs the text. The most agregious error is in Laura Nadar's essay in which she inadvertantly accuses Eric Wolf of stealing documents when he was in fact the recipient of such documents. Even the most sympathetic reader will eventually question the conclusions reached by the contributors"
3,"Useful, But Narrow","A book such as this is somewhat valuable, but I was disappointed by the narrowness of the people included. It's as if only Leftists in universities had any experience of the Cold War, and since we know this to be false, why not call this book ""Leftist Academics and The Cold War University"" or something? What about the old guys reading Latin texts in their offices who thought the world was going mad? What about old-fashioned Liberals who were profoundly ambivilent towards both the American Right and the Stalinist (and post-Stalinist)American Left? The editor was more interested, I suppose, in gathering lefty celebs with high name recognition than he was in getting a ground level view, and that mention of Studs Terkel in the above editorial comments made me yearn for some of Terkel's interest in the folks who are usually overlooked in the rush to sign up the people who've already had their say. Until a good oral history of that sort comes around, I guess this will have to do."
2,reviews and book title misleading,I expected a loompanics type of catalog with book listings mixed with several 2 or 3 page articles. This book is just a catalog with pictures of the books and a small paragraph next to the book picture of what the book discusses...THERE IS NO 2 or 3 page alternative ARTICLE INFORMATION.
5,Through the LookingGlass Darkly,"One does not play ""Deus Ex""--one plays in the dark world of off-kilter chaos, oppression, and secrets. No one will have the same game experience as UNATCO agent J.C.Denton--one can play to take every enemy out--with extreme prejuidice--or one can play the way I play--combining stealth with sniper tacrics (and an occasional GEP rocket launched or LAM hurled for good measure.) Winding one's way through these graphics--from the sewers of Hell's Kitchen to the reflective floors of UNATCO HQ and VersaLife--will dazzzle one's eyes--feels like the silver age ""Detective Comics"" have come to life on my flat panel. The only game that will be better will be ""Deus Ex 2""!"
3,Poor Play Ported from a PC,After completing Pod Racer I was hoping to find a game with equal merit. Not the case with this PC port. The game is visually very dark and the game takes forever to load scenes at least for a new iMac 400DV with 196MB.
3,"Right-wing story, good game","Deus Ex, as anyone will tell you, is a hard but enjoyable game that takes a lot of patience. No complaints there. I was loving this game until the story line unfolds. It seems that there is a UN conspiracy to kill all ordinary Americans. Hmmmm... a plot worthy of a Nevadan isolationist loon. It gets worse as you play. If you can stomach it, buy the game, but be warned."
3,it could have been better,"First of all I love CSI. So when I ordered this calendar I thought I was going to get a wall calendar. Instead I got a desk calendar. Every day of the week it has new facts about the show and the world of CSI. That's fun, I like that. The calendar has so much information it's not even funny. But the fact that it's a desk calendar is not so great. I don't like having to tear off the next page to reveal the next day. And the way it looks is disappointing. It looks and feels cheap. Like whoever put it together didn't give it much thought. I swear I haven't even used the calendar after a couple of weeks.Get it if you're a fan and you really wanna know what's it like to have this product. Or better yet see what it looks like in a store before buying it. To each is own.I need a wall calendar with glossy photos and great info about the show...that's just me. That they should make."
5,Detailed Pictures in this Desktop Calendar,"I was impressed by this calendar! Although I thought it was a wall calendar, my disappointment quickly faded as I looked through the colourful pages featuring all of the CSI stars and crime scene related tidbits."
2,Susannah is better live than on cds,"My wife and I had the privilege of hearing Susannah live on several occasions at the Oak Room in the Big Apple. What a great live performer Susannah was. I feel like she is much better live than on recordings.What a tragedy it was when we got the news of her death. We felt like she was a member of our extended family. She was a great performer, but least of all a great person. She did a lot of charity work, but never ask for publicity. We will al miss her!As far as this cd goes, we only liked 5 songs out of the 14 performed her. My calculator says this is only a 40% rating so all we can give her for this effort is a 2 star rating. We need to be honest disite our friendship.In conclusion we would like to say that we know Susannah is with God and that when we die we will reunited with her again. With all our love, Mom and Pops"
2,A great recital disqualified by unacceptable sonics,"The absurd price being asked for this CD on the used market will no doubt be enough to put buyers off, but in case the unwary are tempted, I must report that the sound is dismal, Richter's piano being reduced to a thumping, boomy blur that is frankly unlistenable. Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's ""other"" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading. Luckily, because they are favorites we have rival performances that sound much better."
4,Good for Price,"The keyboard is definitely used, the arrow and shift keys stick a little at times, but it's still in really good condition. I'm especially happy with the price. And now I have my Mac shortcuts back. This is much better than using a Mac with a PC keyboard."
2,any better recomandations ?,"disappointed with this CD, may be the greatest hits but not the greatest CD...It is protrayed as the greatest Piano hits, but some tracks have a man whistling as the lead. Another track sounded more like a harpsicord rather than a piano.Has anyone a really good pure piano CD to recommand ?"
5,Great to have these available,Catching up on all the old episodes I missed when I was in high school. I love this old soap!
5,pleased,I was pleased with how quickly I received this item. I have enjoyed watching it and it was in like new condition
3,Missing Feature,I've reviewed several digital cameras and one thing that most users all recommended that I have is USB Port connection. This camera seems excellent in every other category. Is it an oversite or is there a better way of communicating with ones computer?
4,"annoying voice, but good songs","if you can get past the female vocalist's singing voice (which my husband disparagingly refers to as church singing), this is actually a very nice collection of songs. most are familiar western children's melodies, like 'old macdonald', 'mary had a little lamb', and 'london bridge' with korean lyrics. some of these lyrics are translations of the english lyrics, but others are not. the remainder of the songs are traditional korean children's songs that i remember singing when i was little. the best thing is that my [...] daughter is actually picking up some korean from these songs and she loves to listen to the CD, which is a full 45 minutes of entertainment. definitely recommended!"
4,Good intro for kids,"My child just loves this professionally done book with CD. He is just starting to learn his Korean, and loves the songs. A great way to introduce the language to children."
5,CR-V Reflector,Great service. Arrived quickly and fit perfectly. Can't ask for anything more or less.
4,Automotive for the Common Person,"This book takes everything you need to know about automotive electrical systems and puts it into casual yet informative and respectable language. Full of diagrams and pictures it walks you through Electronics. From the standpoint of a Automotive Professor this book teaches you like a beginner, not as if you were an expert like many other books. It has saved so much money and time. You won't regret it!"
4,Auto electronics,My son needed this book for a class he was taking and the price for a new book here was much cheaper than the college. He will definitely use Amazon again when he needs textbooks. Book was new and arrived in great condition.
3,Didn't work in our computer,Be sure to get the right game for your computer system. My dtr was disappointed that this was not compatible.
3,Not quite full,"upon opening the product and installing it into my printer I find; it isn't full and I had to refill the cartridge before I was able to use it. Otherwise the product arrived on time and in good shape; the package wasn't ; crushed, torn, nor otherwise destoyer in anyway."
3,Why not recycled ink cartridges?,Canon has made it almost impossible to use recycled ink cartridges. They are not alone. There should be an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to the monopoly on providing ink that is now held by the manufacturer. Just think if you buy a car and could only buy gas from the car manufacturer!
4,Don't Buy Green Recycled Ink Cartridges from Walmart!,"Canon Cartridges work well in Canon printers. I bought Green from Walmart and a month later, I put them in and THEY WOULD NOT WORK even after performing every maintence procedure TWICE. DEEP CLEANING, NOZZLE JET CLEANING, nothing! I had thrown out the receipt and Walmart would not take them back. The GREEN outfit never replied to my complaints."
4,Good colors,It was a good price and we are happy with the color. Arrived promptly and was exactly what we ordered.
1,Used cartridge,"When I open up the package, the head of the cartridge looks worn and used. Installing it on my printer, it complained the cartridge is bad.Buyers - beware."
3,Very short lifetime,"I bought this CL-41 cartridge because it was supposed to have significantly more ink than the CL-31 color cartridge. It ran out in a month without very heavy usage. This was very disappointing as the cheaper CL-31 lasted longer and is much cheaper.Otherwise, same color quality as Canon's CL-31 color ink cartridge."
3,Its ink,"Its ink, its expensive, but its what I need for my printer. Its way cheaper on amazon than at any local store. Always buy new though, the used or refurbished ones never last. This was new and is perfect. Saved about $8 on it."
4,ink review,The ink was just what they said it would be and works fine in my computer. It was competitively priced.
4,Good Product,I've used this product in an admittedly low end Canon printer but it has produced very good color documents and acceptable photos.
4,"Works great, much better than the remanufactred ones",The Black Ink remanufactered ink catridges work great in my printer. However the printer rejected the color remanufactered cartridges. This particular one works great and is recognized.
3,Does not last,"This ink does not last but what can you do? I guess don't buy the printers that require it. Maybe better off buying the longer lasting -51, maybe not. Not sure whether it's the fault of the printer or the ink."
2,too expensive,"This ink is way too expensive (although it's cheaper here than some brick & mortar stores near me). My Canon MP470 blows through this stuff, and I hate that it somehow needs a color cartridge when printing in black and white. That's more of a ding against Canon overall than this ink in particular, but the prices are ridiculous for what you get."
4,NO OTHER CHOICE,"Canon printers (at least model 2600) won't accept OEM and remanufactured cartridges. So the 40-41's are the only choice. Oh, they print well, for the short amount of time such expensive necessities last."
5,Genuine Canon Cartridge Delivers,"The Canon 41 ink cartridge works well and lasts long, though I don't count the number of photos I print. I have never needed to ""align"" the print when replacing a Canon Cartridge. The colors are good and close to the original scene. I have had worse luck with refilled and third-party cartridges."
2,Overpriced!,"It's a tri-color ink cartridge and nothing more. Do not expect to get much use out of this little guy (especially if you print photos, which I dare not do with ink this costly). I've switched to greyscale printing on nearly everything due to the cost of these cartridges. Worse yet, the remanufactured CL-41s are not much cheaper, especially considering the inferior quality versus the Canon-brand new ones.Is the ink good? Sure. Is the price right? No. My advice: Check the price of both new and third party ink cartridges/tanks prior to purchasing a printer. While I like Canon printers, some of them have a very high cost per page (generally, the Canon printers with separate tanks for each color ink have the best cost per page, so stick to those and avoid the tri-color cartridge printers)."
5,OEM the best,Have used many aftermarket ink cart. ! Having done this I have learned to buy only OEM ink refills. You will see why after making the mistake I did.
1,Canon CL-41 Color Fine Ink Cartridge,"I Bought The Canon CL-41 Color Fine Ink Cartridge From A Amazon Online Vender When I Installed The Cartridge The Ink Level Waring Came On,I Had To Email The Seller And Wait For A Responce He Told Me To Reinstall The Cartridge And The Warning Would Not Be There I Did And The Warning Was Still There,I Will Not Buy Anything From This Seller Again.Bad Buy."
2,Wish I'd Gotten it!,"I ordered the cartridge and had to email to find out why it hadn't shipped when the black one (ordered @ same time) did.I was told it was no longer available from the supplier and that I would be refunded.Almost 1 month after order the cartridge is still showing as ""shipped"" in my order history the only way I know I didn't get stuck with the payment is to check the credit card history.I'm disappointed, Amazon usually does such a Great Job getting their products out or getting in touch with me if there is a snag.I feel they dropped the ball on this order."
1,"never received it, so I really can't review it","I never received this product because UPS couldn't find my house. From now on, i will not order anything unless it can be shipped to my P.O. box. UPS sometimes can't find my home, or if I am not there, they return the item. The Post Office holds my packages until I pick them up!!!Amazon refunded my money."
5,Cannon printer ink,"This is just what I wanted, it came just as I ordered, and very speedily at that, and it was just what it was suppose to be."
2,"Leaky, Caused Problems",I have a Canon Pixma MP470. After I installed the ink cartridge it began to leak and caused a lot of problems. I won't be purchasing this again.
3,"Works well, but is very costly","The ink is ink. What more can be said? The cost is absurd. In todays market, one can almost buy a new printer, rather than stock ink for this older model printer."
3,Works well but runs out FAST,"This cartridge is working well for me, but you don't get a whole lot of printing out of it. I'm used to B/W laser printers where I change cartridges every several years! Here I think I'll need a new color every month and a new B/W every two month. I think the model 41 has larger capacity than the slightly cheaper model 31. I previously tried a third party refill for this type of cartridge. Not only did the colors come out wrong but it did not communicate properly to the computer that the ink cartridge was full. I guess I'll stick with the Canon originals. 5 stars except for VERY frustrating how limited the capacity is for the price. POSTSCRIPT FEB 2008: I WOULD CHANGE THIS REVIEW TO ONE STAR IF AMAZON WOULD LET ME. THE INK RUNS OUT SO FAST ITS BIZARRE. CANON MAKES SUCH GREAT CAMERAS, WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT PRINTER?"
5,great colors,"I purchased this after I had a problem with other manufacturer's compatible inks, which color quality wasn't as great as original and ink spit on papers unevenly. I ended up buying original Canon inks, but it worth it."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"After being ""ripped off"" for years, finally decided to purchase another printer. The Canon ink cartridges are MUCH too expensive and they need to be replaced MUCH too often.Now, I have a Epson and I no longer have that problem. Have the Epson Stylus NX215 All in One printer and although I've only had it a short time, I can already tell that I've solved the problem w/ Canon. Also, with the Epson, I can keep track of the ink use for each color."
3,Great transaction!!,"Great transaction with seller. Ink cartridges suggest that they hold more ink than the Canon Cl-31, but that is not the case. I can run at least 300 brochures on the Cl-31, but I could only run 200 with this cartridge and nothing on my brochures have changed."
4,Good Ink Source,"So far so good... this cartridge is still printing good, saturated, clean images after several weeks. This has not been the case with some cartridges I have purchased from other sources."
1,"didn't even want it, but...","Alas. I do not print in color, only black ink, as I only print words. However, while older printers do print in black only, and even my computer can give the order to print black only, modern printers demand that you must put in color ink. Even when it only uses black. The cartrige that came with the printer somehow grew empty over 4 years and refused to print, until I put this new color cartrige in.So I can't even tell you if it works or not, just that with it in, the black ink now prints."
2,"Good quality, bad value","This replacement for my (former) Canon printer of course works well when first installed. However, there can't be more than 10 drops of ink in this thing. I barely lasts a modest color printing project. And god forbid you don't use your printer for a little while, this thing will dry right up. Worst of all, when your color cartridge is low, your printer won't let you print black and white. Yeah, that's right, you have to keep a full color cartridge in your printer even if all you usually do is print black text. So, by the time you actually go to print some color pictures, your color cartridge is all dried up.Let's just say this made me finally make the switch to laser. With some of the sub $100 options out there, it's a no-brainer."
2,Big let Down,"This product does not work well with my printer. the printer will show no remaining ink left for black or color but they are full, also after printing no more than 10 pages the printer reported that it was out of ink, and I had to replace the cartridge but the ink cartridge is still full. With the new cartridge the printers is working fine, Your refurbish Cartridge does not work, stick with new."
5,Ink for less!,I feel most ink cartridges are way overpriced so I shop for the best deals. This is it! Quantum Electronics offers the best price I have found on both Canon color and black ink cartridges.I will be a returning customer.
5,Canon Color Fine Ink Cartridge,This a great buy compared to buying it locally in Staples. Signing up for auto delivery makes it an even better buy!
4,No Complaints.,"I've got a Canon MP310 and it works beautifully. I've used this CL-41 to print photos on photo paper and it's worked fine for that purpose as well as standard printing.The cartridge arrived in new condition, works fine and I have no complaints aside from the sheer cost of replacement cartridges, but that's what we get with printers these days, it seems.My only tip is to ensure that you get the right cartridge for your printer, since there are so many out there."
3,Canon CL-41 Color FINE Ink Cartridge,"This cartridge works ok , however, it does not register with my printers ink gage. My printer shows ""OUT OF INK"" all the time. Also, The picture on the web page shows a Canon box and cartridge, but the product I received is not a Canon but a replacement ."
2,Lost money,I was completely unhappy with this product. I am not sure where the patented noise reduction technology that is advertised was but my family could not hear me due to background noise on interstated drives. When I was not on the interstate they said I sounded like I was in a hole. I was told I could return it (still out the shipping to and from) but now I can't find the box.I bought the new jawbone bluetooth that has gotten the highest Cnet rating ever and it is awesome. Spend the money the first time and get the best.
2,Looks good and...that's about it,Constantly had problems with breaks in the mic's audio. The user can hear OK but you'll be driven nuts if you're the person on the other end. Don't buy.
2,Not too happy,"Brought the ear piece for my wife who's very picky and wanted one to match her blackberry, found this one and the reviews were pretty good so I tried it and it worked good for about 2 weeks then it just went out on me, would not hold a charge, the seller only gives a 15 day warranty so now I have to try and go through the company to try and get refund."
2,Save your money,"I loved this little thing and it worked so well but only for a short time. I toss it in my purse after I use so I'm sure it's partly my fault. The ear piece came completely disconnected from the rest of it. I really didn't have it that long. What a dissappointment. It really works great and I LOVE the color and how light it is, but the ear thing needs to be more solid/sturdy."
2,Don't go there,"Like others, I thought Plum Island, Gold Coast and The General's Daughter were good fare, but Spencerville? This novel could have lost 100 pages of pillow talk and been a bit more interesting to read. Add to that, 50 pages of sarcasm and you've got yourself a bonafide DeMille classic."
1,spenceville,"after reading to page 210, pages 211 to 242 were missing. A major screw up by the publisher. We could not finish the book.Unhappy."
2,Brutality toward herione was sickening.,I love Nelson DeMille and was pretty much enjoying this book until towards the end when Annie is held hostage and sexually and physically brutalized by her husband. It was extremely disturbing and went on forever. It truly made me feel that in order to write something like this that perhaps Nelson DeMille has a problem. I could barely get through it. What a disappointment from an author I used to think it would be such fun to meet!
4,"Creative, Captivating, and Terrific","This was the first work of Nelson Demille I have read and I must say it was outstanding. Although it started a little slow, once the action picked up I found myself reluctant to put it down. I have recommended Spencerville to all of my friends."
4,No indifference with this book. You either love or hate it.,"I loved the characterization in this novel, the compelling internal conflicts and layers of experiences that shaped these characters into the people they've become. The suspense is more subtle than in some of DeMille's other novels, yet it's perfect for this plot and these characters. DeMille has a tight grasp on the fears and doubts that motivate people, and in this novel he shares those insights magnificently with readers."
4,"A departure, welcome or not, from his previous works,","this is an engaging story that disproves the old saw, ""you can'tgo home again."" To the extent you find yourself rootingfor the main character, it's basically like any other DeMillework. The good news for DeMille fans is that this book'ssetting and storyline prove that DeMille doesn't need waror a military base as a backdrop for fine storytelling.This book will definitely keep you engaged, and even ifkeen readers will be able to predict the ending, it's a goodstory nonetheless."
4,"Take it for what it is just a fun story,","I just finished Spensorville, and I thought it was another winner from Demille. This is a departure from other Demille novels, in that he cut out the technical espionage of his other novels. This is a simple love triangle between an old flame coming back to reclaim his old girl friend from her abusive bully husband, who is also the Sheriff of Spenserville. The only difference is that The old Boyfriend has 25 years of CIA training under his belt. This was one interesting intense simple novel. I really enjoyed it."
4,Not my favorite but still a good read - It's still DeMille,"I really like DeMille and have read pretty much everything he puts out. Spencerville was a little different than most, but it still that wit and humor along with a suspenseful story line. I didn't like it as much as I did the Detective Cory series, but it was still a good read, moved along fast and had you rooting for the hero. I wouldn't want to miss this one, but I would read Plum Island, Lion's Game and the Lion first. Word of Honor was also one of my all time favorites of DeMille's.Randy TalleyAuthorEmily's Gold"
1,Spencerville,"Big fan of Nelson DeMille, but Spencerville was a big disappointment. If this had been the first DeMille book I read, I would never have read another. We listened to the audio book and had to fast forward through much of it. Mr DeMille, you are so much better than that."
3,spencerville,"An interesting work, but many of the other Demille novels are better. Lots of action in the beginning and end, the rest sort of draws a long line.Still, good reading for a long air flight."
3,Boringville,This is the lowest I would rate a DeMille book.Most I would rate 5 stars. It's good but not up to snuff.
1,When Does the Story Start?,"I just can't finish this book. I'm probably two thirds the way through it and the story still hasn't kicked in. I guess there's this man who moves back to his hometown for reasons that are not at all believeable who gets in something of a confrontation with the local police chief who's married to his high school sweetheart. That's the premise and perhaps not an irretrievably bad one, but when does the story begin? Perhaps unfairly, I couldn't help comparing the story to Elmore Leonard's ""Valdez is Coming."" There's a story of vengeance between a strong man and the town's local kingpin bully. Valdez not only stands up to the town's boss, but also steals his woman. It's perfectly paced and well told; the action scenes are very cool and macho; and at no time is at unbelievable. In short, it's everything that Spencerville is not."
2,Violence Against Women?,"I'd read a number of DeMille's books, including Gold Coast and Talbot Oddessy, before hearing someone complain about his gratuitous use of violence against women. I thought back to Gold Coast -- which I'd loved -- and realized that, yes, it had some questionable scenes. Then I read Spencerville, and I don't think I'll ever read another one of his novels. Every criticism of the book is accurate -- it's trite, the characters are cliche, etc. However, the graphic husband-wife rape scene is simply over the edge. I realized that every DeMille book I've ready includes not just horribly graphic violence, usually intensely graphic sexual violence against women. I then saw the film of The General's Daughter. Is this for real? A woman's reaction to her rape is to have herself tied up, spread-eagle, and naked? Please.I don't think there's any reason to encourage this crap. DeMille is a great author, I wish he'd grow up a little."
1,Don't bother,I've read several Nelson DeMille books and this does not live up to his writing and plot creating ability. Very amateurish and more along the lines of a soap opera/modern romance novel. Forget it!
3,Not Demille's Finest Hour,"When one reads Demille's previous works, including ""The General's Daughter,"" ""Charm School,"" ""Talbot Island,"" and ""Night Fall,"" (although that one had too predictable an ending) ""Spencerville"" was a real letdown. Being a native Ohioan myself, it was refreshing to read state geography and recognize it. However, the book stretched the reader's suspension of disbelief far past it's limit. I was reeled in by the promise of more CIA espionage and intrique, yet sadly disappointed to discover the book's true colors. Someone as seasoned as Landry was supposed to be making some of the idiotic mistakes that were being made was just frustrating to read.I like Demille's other books, so I will continue to read them and dearly hope that this one was a literary anomole."
3,Spencerville,"Spencerville is not my favorite DeMille book. Annie, highly intelligent and creative, stays with an abusive husband in a loveless marriage? She came out of 70's but ended up having her every move watched and challenged? After reading this book I didn't feel it added anything to my knowledge or understanding of the world. I know its just a work of fiction. THANK GOODNESS!!"
1,"adolescent, misogynistic garbage",I can't believe this author is so popular. Someone gave me this book--I finished it only because I couldn't believe what garbage it was--I kept thinking it had to get better. Do not waste your time or money buying or reading this book.
1,Horrible!,"Generally, I love DeMille and have read almost all his books. I actually listened to Spencerville as a ""book on tape"" in the car, and found myself yelling at the characters because they were so incredibly stupid. (I'm sure the other drivers thought I was insane!)"
5,Great Book!,"This is my second N.D. book. The first was Plum Island. Spencerville was a page turner - very well written all in all and a good story. Yeah, maybe the story was predictable, but that doesn't matter. I'm definitely going to read more of his books. I would definitely recommend this book."
2,Domestic abuse is not his best subject,"DeMille has written some excellent, fast-paced, engaging action about terrorists, cops, and spies. He creates an identifiable, likeable, male lead. But this is one of his weakest works, about a small-town guy who returns from sadness in the big city, only to find himself immersed in the small-time life he thought he had set aside years ago. Enter the old girl friend, with an abusive boy friend and soon you have a struggle between good and evil with an antagonist not worth our time. He makes the hero less heroic. And the dark side of domestic abuse simply does not rouse the interest, passion, or even sympathy for the characters of his other books.I'd pass on this. There are so many other, great DeMille works: Cathedral, Rivers of Babylon, Charm School, Plum Island, and more."
2,Why did I read this,"Spencerville by Nelson Demille starts out great and eventually bored me to the point I stopped reading. Unfortunately, it kept me interested enough through almost 400 pages (a wasted week for me). It's the story of an international spy who is forced to retire. He decides to return to his small Midwestern hometown and re-kindle an old relationship, while dealing with old rivals. Demille realistically captures the characters of a typical small town, and what it is like to return after being gone for years. However, the story is worn out, and extremely predictable. After a few hundred pages, the love story gets nauseating. This would not have been a bad novel if it was shortened, but 600+ pages is more than it deserves."
5,Total entertainment,"After this book, Demille became one of my favorite authors. This is a real thriller that I enjoyed a lot. I have only one word, terrific ! Mr Demille you are a genious"
1,disgusting and boring,"I have enjoyed all of Nelson DeMille's books, but this one is not in the same league as the rest of them at all. It was tawdry and boring. I only kept reading it thinking it had to get better. I was so disgusted at the end that I actually threw it away. I would never recommend it to an enemy, much less a friend."
3,Not your typical DeMille,"I have grown to LOVE Nelson DeMille (very much recommend NIGHT FALL).This book, however, left me scratching my head. Just not the typical exciting writing I have come to expect from Mr. DeMille. This was more chick lit with a little manly drama thown in."
4,"A fun read, but a little far fetched!!","Spencerville was a fun book to read. It was action packed, there is a definite hero, there is love, action, suspence, and there is revenge, but it is a little difficult to believe parts of the story line. I have met people like Cliff Baxter, but none of them would go to the extremes that Baxter goes to in this novel.This book reminds me of a sophisticated ""First Blood"". Instead of the hero being a rugged John Rambo, the hero is a well dressed, clean shaven Keith Landry who, instead of being a Green Beret War hero, is a top government secret agent who happened to date the Sherrif's wife when he was in high school and college. The action in this book is great, but it seems a little far fetched. I would read this book as entertainment, but wouldn't spend too much time trying look at the realism."
2,Not his best book.,"I had read 3 DeMille books before diving into this one. I was very excited because I had recently purchased all the novels he had ever written. I found Spencerville to be a catchy title and the synopsis at the back grabbed my attention so I chose to read that one out of all his other books I had just gotten. Well, after about 100 pages, I started worrying. I was devasted to find this book to be so boring, uninteresting and void of likeable characters. I was desperatly hoping that this one ""not so great book"" was a mere over-sight. And thankfully, it was. I have read two more of his books since then (mayday and catherdral) and both were soooooooooo amazing! I read both books in record time.I found Spenceville to be far too predictable. One could have guessed the ending after about 10 pages. The book got rather lenghty and windy at times. It is not to say that I regret having read it, far from it. I did enjoy a few scenes but it is definitely not his best."
2,Boring but not the best,I thought that this book was very boring but it did keep you reading. Nelson Demille's best book so far has been the General's Daughter.
1,pure drivel,"Nelson DeMille has written some excellent books such as the Gold Coast and Charm School. However, this book does not even come close to the excellent writing that DeMille has previously shown. The characters are almost cartoonish in their sterotypical portrayals. It is impossible to believe that a man such a Cliff Baxter would reign supreme in the small town Spencerville, and that his wife Annie, would suffer through his neanderthal and emotionally abusive behavior for 20 years, awaiting a rescue from her high school/college lover, Kieth Landry. The ending, which I gather is meant to be suspenseful, is so outlandish and implausible I nearly laughed from the stupidity. If you like to read for the sake of reading, you might be able to stomach this book. If you want a book of depth and meaning, pass this one! Choose the Gold Coast, Talbot Oddysey or any other DeMille book but this."
5,One of Demille's very best reads.,"With only one exception, which is now on order, I have read all of DeMille's books. I Would rate Spencerville as one of his very best and my personal favorite."
3,Dissappointment from DeMille,"I could and did put Spencerville away between readings. Dissappoiting...yet, only because I had such high expectations. I found myself on a rollercoaster throughout the book. Brief moments of drama and suspense interrupted by pointless flashbacks and morality checks that never allowed the story to maintain momentum. Nelson DeMille ceartainly did not show his usual self in character and plot development. A fine book for a short afternoon; once you skip through the dribble you won't need any more time than that. Even the final climax felt more like a feather than a hammer when it was all said and done."
2,A GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT FROM MY FAVORITE AUTHOR.,"NELSON DEMILLE IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR PLUM ISLAND TO BE PUBLISHED, HOWEVER, SPENCERVILLE WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WEAKEST OF HIS BOOKS. AS USUAL, THE WRITING IS EXCELLENT, THE STORY IS LACKING. THE BOOK MOVES ALONG, BUT LACKS THE EXCITEMENT AND EDGE OF YOUR SEAT READING THAT I AM ACCUSTOMED TO WITH DEMILLE. READ IT IF YOU ARE A DEMILLE FAN, BUT READ THE OTHERS FIRST"
2,A stinker,"DeMille's character in this book is out of character most of the time. The book starts out well, but as it gets into the geteway scene Keith Landry, a retired ex intelligence bigwig, with contacts all over official Washington including a 24 hour old interview with the President who offered him a job as the aid to the National Security Counsel Chairman, forgets that he can use a telephone and get immediate assistance to head off a small town police chief. This plot line begs the imagination. While trying to get out of Ohio he stops in Toledo and can't get a flight out. Gosh, stymied again, we have forgotten all geography lesson, like the Michign border is less than a half hour away, and Detroit airport less than an hour. DeMille writes well, but he must have had a badly educated summer intern plot this out."
2,Spencerville,"Mr. DeMille's writing style cannot be beat! Even when the main character turns out to be an overrated wimp, it's hard to put the book down. As usual, this novel has lots of action. The writing cannot be faulted, but the hero is less than heroic. He does not live up to his self perception and in most situations, is saved by others. I look forward to more real men as DeMille's main characters. If Keith Landry was supposed to be a loser, the author portrayed him perfectly."
1,reads like a Lifetime movie; bad,"I got through about 15% of this book before putting it down. I love Nelson DeMille's John Corey books, but most everything else I've tried of his reads like a bad Lifetime movie. (Which is to say, any Lifetime movie!)His antagonist, Cliff Baxter, is a stereotypical evil bully chief of police in a small town. He lords over everyone, including his wife, who makes a half-hearted attempt to kill him early on. Ironically, her former lover, Keith Landry, moves back to town from his career as a national intelligence officer. He still has feelings for her, although he knows she's married. Think Keith and Cliff will do battle later on? I'm assuming so, but I'm not sticking around to find out.DeMille seems more interested in describing every acre of Spencerville and its politics than in telling a good story. Which is unfortunate, because most of the Cory novels (except ""Up Country"") are great."
1,Predictibleville............,"If this had been the first DeMille book I'd picked up, I would have never read another. There are absolutely tons of these books written by other people. They are all the same....psychotic husband/boyfriend, beautiful girlfriend/wife. Or maybe she's just gone somewhere to get away from the big city and some maniac picks her out. Whatever, you know how it will end. I read it to the end---I'm a sucker for punishment (sort of...skipping long passages of abuse by the bad guy and musings by the good guy about how the world has changed, the fate of small time farms, etc). Was disappoionted that he didn't save the drunk ex-Vietnam vet...as soon as he came into the plot, I knew he was a gonner. He has written other books that are so good...I was amazed that this could be so bad."
2,Domestic violence does not a compelling thriller make,"DeMille's odyssey into the heartland of America does not come across as a taut thriller the way ""The Lion's Game"" did. Instead, it's as if a Lifetime Movie of the Week were created in book form. The cat-and-mouse games between the protagonist and the villain make for somewhat tense reading at times, but I'll be at the library looking for something that DeMille wrote with Detective John Corey in it; those books are far superior to this one."
3,Pleasant Read For Demille Fans,"Having read with great enthusiasm Demille's By The Rivers of Babylon, The General's Daughter, Charm School, and Plum Island, I eagerly jumped into Spencerville expecting an exciting story of intrigue and espionage mixed with sardonic comedy, with vivid character development and great use of dialogue (Demille's greatest writing asset). Three hundred pages into the book I decided that what I had found was a pleasant walk through the woods with just a bit of intrigue, not much espionage, not much humor, fair character development, and less than great dialogue (yet, still better than many books of greater popularity). Unlike other Demille books, the reader does not know whether to cheer for the hero or question his motives and tactics. Nevertheless, a satisfying read for Demille devotees."
3,A love story for guys,"A story you might read in a Harliquin romance novel, but with a guy twist and DeMille witty sense of humor. Not my favorite DeMille book but certainly better than a number of books by other authors that I have struggle to get through."
3,Not what I expected from DeMille,"Okay. When I go to the library and I pick up a book that says ""Nelson DeMille"" on the cover, I go home expecting to read a novel about the military or terrorism or a criminal plot. I don't expect to read about ""Bridges of Madion County."" What happened here? A retired CIA operative goes back to his old hometown and looks up his first love? And they sneak around to avoid detection from the bad guy husband, small town cop?This book is about love renewed and romance and passion. Which is all well and good, unless you're expecting a DeMille novel of crime, murder and violence. Perhaps Mr. DeMille should use a pseudonym - or maybe he already is - Nora Robers?"
2,By far not the best of Nelson DeMille's...,"Compared with Plum Island and The General's Daughter, this book seemed to not even have been written by the same author. I only finished it because I kept hoping it'd get better. What wife would stay with a man like Cliff for 20 years? And the hippie couple -- what were they all about? Oh well, I'm still a DeMille fan, and I'm buying The Lion's Game in January 2000."
1,The book is awful,"I never made it to the end of this book. It simply bored me to death. I kept asking myself, ""What is the purpose of this story?"" The reader follows the main character as he returns to the town he once left. Never was it explained (to my satisfaction) why this return is even worthy of a story. I kept asking myself, ""Why is the author telling me this?"" There simply appeared to be no purpose to the story at all. Finally, after continually asking myself, ""Why am I wasting my time reading this book,"" I had to put it down. I could not sustain my interest in the book any further.As an author, I love Nelson DeMille. I read The General's Daughter and couldn't put it down. The book is excellent. I therefore couldn't understand how a man who could write such a great book as The General's Daughter could produce such a poor work as Spencerville. I haven't lost faith in Mr. Deville. He's still one of my favorite authors. I'm looking forward to reading Plum Island."
3,Nothing like expected from a DeMille book.,I picked book because of the author.3 stars because it was not up to the level of other DeMille books.
4,DeMille on home soil.,"Typical DeMille fare, though this time on home soil. Always a good read. Good characterisations, and relentless tension. Very hard to put down once started."
4,Good reference book,This book has been most helpful to me in preparing and conducting a Bible Study session on St. Paul's Letter to the Romans.
4,japanese punk and ska rules,"although japanese punk and ska gets no recognition, there are many talented bands. i live in japan because my dad works here for the navy and i have been to many shows and seen several bands. i have seen nicotine, potshot, xarts, young punch, sipmoc, no end why, sholder hopper, scafull king, and snail ramp. all of the bands were great but xarts was incredible. they play punk with a little bit of ska and there shows are very energetic and exiting. it pisses me off that they dont sell many japanese cds on this website. you guys need to get them because i know that many people will buy them if they ever hear them. kemuri is also great"
2,Cheap CD,"The music on this CD is a lame imitation of Meco Monardo's fabulous disco-style sci-fi music. What is even worse is the fact that this entire disk consists of only nine minutes of music! Even a 3-inch CD can hold more than that, but this is a full-sized disk."
3,wrong year model,the harness seems to be of good construction but the connections changed (i think for all Chrysler vehicles but at least for jeep) in 2005 not 2006 as listed. great buy if you are looking for a harness for a 88-05 Chrysler vehicle.
1,Metra's got it's years mixed up.,"This product does NOT fit 2002 Chrysler vehicles. I have an '02 PT Cruiser and an '02 Town and Country, and it fits neither. I've been waiting anxiously to install my new Pioneer stereo only to be let down - what a waste of time and energy. If Metra can't fix their product descriptions, I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to go back to buying from Scosche."
1,2004 Dodge Intrepid - No Good,Doesn't fit the 2004 Dodge Intrepid. Go to Metra Online dot com to see which one you ACTUALLY need. The lookup here isn't accurate.
1,Not right at all!,"The product description claims it fits 1988-06 Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep -- WRONG! I have a 2003 Jeep Wrangler, and this plug isn't even close to a match for the factory plug. Looks like I'll have to look up a wiring diagram and cut into all the factory wiring after all. Very disappointed!"
1,go to a local store,product didn't work..during installation of radio had to go to a local store to get another that worked before radio installed.. very disappointed.
3,Incorrect application,"I bought this for my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it was not even close. They need to add to the description. I can only speek for the Cherokees but I found out that that the style harness I needed is used on 2002 and up models. The ""Scosche"" CR02B is the harness that is needed. The other smaller harness is for the cd changer that you will have to interface yourself if your new head unit has the interface. Mine does but I only used the changer because my factory radio had no auxilary input. I now have USB for my I-Pod and Bluetooth for my phone as well as a standard aux. jack in front for the headphone type cable so I didn't bother with the changer.Still gave it three stars because it would be fine for the correct application."
5,Great!!,"I used this Metra wiring harness also with a Metra single DIN installation kit to put a Pioneer head unit into a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, worked perfect!! I highly recommend their products."
5,Perfect fit,This item fit and worked perfectly! It had a complete diagram to work with the existing Jeep Harness. I would recommended.
1,did not match the discription,the ithem i recive did not match the description i didnt even look like the ones on the picture sorry but you not get a good review if you not sell the right stuff
2,Questionable Use of Great Talent,"We watched this movie before reading any of the reviews and came to a very similar conclusion with most of them. This was a choppy, disjointed movie that left one wondering; ""what was that all about?"" It presented a version of Holmes that was too over-the-top for me to enjoy.As some have pointed out the one hour episodes aired on ""Mystery Theater"" all seem to maintain a crisp focus which this movie lacked. The over-long section on Holmes dreams definitely looked like filler to use up more time; which to me was time wasted.At the end, efforts were made to tie all of the loose ends together and as far as I recall they were pretty much eventually explained.I'm sure I will not watch this one again and would strongly suggest if anyone is curious about this movie, rent it first and see what you think before making a purchase decision."
3,A good Holmes adventure,"Having gone through almost the entire Brett series, I was initialy quite impressed by The Eligible Bachelor. But over the years, it has somewhat diminished in stature. It's still a good full-length movie, but by no means, near as excellent as Sign of Four or The Master Blackmailer.Again, part of the reason was Brett was visibly ill throughout the filming and he has visible weight gains. It was not his best performance, but he still managed to hold it together, as compared to some of his very last performances on the Memoirs.Still, it is far better than the Last Vampyre and the mediocre Hound of the Baskervilles, and that is largely due to Peter Hammond's cinematic style, somewhat similar to The Master Blackmailer. Lots of dark lighting and snappy cuts and reflective shots.It is from this point, that the series took a turn for downwards, but it is still entertaining, but not as rewatchable as some of the best from the series."
1,ANGST WITHOUT PURPOSE,"Or.....an existential feminist coming of menopausal age movie. I utterly could not fathom the reason for making such a film. Perhaps there are those who can, but not I. Sorry, not my kind of movie. I finally learned to like LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, but this is asking too much There was a feminist Dutch movie about a cabal of women shoppers who kill a shopkeeper or salesman, some of you know the one I mean, and this was down there in that absence of purpose and empathy department for me. A woman thinks she might have run over someone while driving and spends the rest of the movie agonizing over whether she did or not, when no evidence whatsoever surfaces that such was the case. Give me a break. And no, don't call me anti-feminist, just a guy who cannot relate to a movie this pointless, with no benchmark for reality."
3,Question of Functionality,My rating has to do with the functionality of the DVD.This is the first foreign language DVD I've ever purchased that had no option for turning off the subtitles. This was especially annoying for me because I'm trying to learn the language and didn't want to see the translation. I think anyone who already knows the language would be equally annoyed at being forced to watch the subtitles.I can give this DVD release only three stars due the poor functionality.
2,has a chance but does not succeed,"This movie had a chance to be some kind of metaphorical or symbolic commentary on women, society, or something else...but it's never really clear what it's supposed to be about. I wasn't expecting a literally headless woman, and I have a pretty good grasp of symbolism. This film simply does not succeed in getting its point across, if it even had a point to begin with."
4,Good listeing,"This cd is what I like about Hiphop. It is what I call live hiphop. Meaning it is a band that plays the beats instead of a DJ. They got driving bass lines,and chilled out keyboards. Most of the songs on this cd are chillen out, groovin tunee, there are a few that do a good job mixin the horns with the turntables and drums and make you wanna dance. I wish i could find FFOF's other albums but they are really hard to find.Pick this up if want that groovin, chill stuf. It is really good."
4,Series,This series is excellent. But be prepared it is different than the manga. But over all I was impressed and enjoyed it.
5,the end....,"I have seen this dvd a number of times and it is great. I have seen that some say it was a bad ending, if you knew about hellsing then you would know the ending is the way it is because it was cancelled half-way through making the series because it was not a big hit in Japan so it was cut. It was a pretty good ending that left a few loose ends but it was really entertaining and fun to watch over and over again, it is worth the money."
5,Great anime series!,"This is the 4th volume of the original adaptation of Hellsing. Personally, I prefer this adaptation to the current Hellsing: Ultimate, even if Ultimate is closer to the manga. Crispin Freeman is magnificent as Alucard. I highly recommend the entire series."
5,Almost like being there,"We had the good fortune to first see Fitzgerald's book while staying at Glin Castle along the River Shannon (Olda Fitzgerald's residence). This garden is one of many spectacular pieces featured. Walking through the actual garden was a walk through a bit of heaven. The photos in the book will serve as a beautiful reminder of what all that rain in Ireland can do to a piece of well cared for earth.Gardens of Ireland depicts the lush beauty of other places that will take priority on my ""must see"" list if I'm lucky enough to return to Ireland. Enjoy!"
4,Not so bright,"I thought that this would be brighter than my standard high beam, but looking at this versus my stock high beam, I can't tell a difference."
2,So So,The seller didn't mention the old musty smell and I wish they would have. I wouldn't have bought it. There is also more writing on the inside front that was mentioned.
5,Brett,"I already owned the Top Grain Leather version and love it. So when Zondervan came out with the Fine Leather version I knew I had to have one. The extras on this Bible are well worth the money. I only have one problem, I don't write in my Bibles very much and the wide margins just add bulk and are unnecessary, Some extra pages at the end would have been better. Most people won't be carrying this bible around with them because of the weight. You really can't enjoy the nice leather for any period of time because you can't hold it for very long (HEAVY). Take the wide margins away and you have a Very Fine Study Bible!!!!!!"
4,Bible study,The book arrived in good shape and packaged well. I use it in my study at church called EFM(education for ministry) Its has been a good source for first year study.
5,most excellent,"This thing is great.... it comments on almost every verse, and has maps and timelines to grab historical reference."
5,It Changed my life,I was never a Bible reader until I ran across this Bible. I now read and study all the time and it has changed my life for ever.
1,There are better study Bibles on the market,"This is a Bible that I would not recommend, for the reason that it has probably the worst subject index I have seen in a study Bible. A lot of the Scripture references that I found were not even close to what the actual verse said, or the Scripture reference wasn't even found in that particular book and chapter. Also, I also found this to be the case in a lot of the study notes as well.Accuracy is key. This looks like it was just thrown together and published without any careful editing."
5,VERY PLEASED,I was very pleased to find exactly what I wanted and it took only a few days to get it. I am enjoying studying with this new Bible.
4,Balanced Commentary on Most Verses,"Though the scholars' notes hardly replace a Biblical commentary, their notes are insightful and balanced. Many controversial subjects in the Bible (e.g., slavery, women, etc.) are given multiple Protestant perspectives. The perspectives, however, are usually on a convervative to moderate continuum - not liberal, that is, there is never a comment that states an extreme liberal point of view (e.g., ""Some believe the Bible is not the word of God"" or ""This philosophy was used in many Eastern religions, and therefore some believe that all religions lead to God). If you're looking for a completely balanced commentary that gives the extreme views, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a commentary that gives multiple views within a more traditional continuum, then this is a fantastic study Bible."
4,Bibles for Grandchildren,"I purchased these bibles for my grandchildren, which are 16 yrs and older.I have one like them, and consider it very good. My grandchildred (3) whoreceived them first, really like it. I would reccomend it to anyone."
2,Dr. G's anti microbial,"I ordered the anitmicrobial Dr. G and was sent an anti-fungal. When I questioned them, I was told this was the newest. I have no idea as Dr. G makes all kinds of similar products. As to it's effectiveness, I have no idea as yet. It was stated on the order for m that this was the newest product but I think that I should have been notified about the change in order so that I had a choice."
3,Garage Door Emergency Release Kit [GDERK],The GDERK was easy to install. The hook connecting to the release tab could have been a little larger.It would be easier to bend so it does not disengage.GJR.
5,A must have item!!,"This garage door opener emergency release kit is a must have item if you do not have another outside entrance into your garage. I was looking into putting in a battery backup on my garage when I stumbled across this product on the Genie website. Instead of paying about $300 for a garage door opener with battery backup already part of the system, or over $100+ to modify my current system for a backup battery, this was just the ticket (and for less than 25 bucks). One tip though...............be sure to record the lock number somewhere safe and grind off the key number on the face of the lock cylinder. This will prevent someone from possibly getting the number and ordering keys from the manufacturer."
3,"George Carlin, one of a kind","George Carlin had several good bits and they are all represented here. The DVD is definitely funny but some of the bits have been shortened by editing and overall I don't believe these particular performances do the man justice. Funny material, but Carlin did them better in other venues. Still, I did have fun with this version and if you've never seen any of George Carlin's routines this serves as a good introduction."
4,Carlinism - The Best exerpts of George Carlin,"Poking fun at ourselves, making us laugh or reminding us to laugh (because we forgot to or did not realize) at those life's funny moments to howl in laughter WAS GEORGE CARLIN. Thinking up goofy s&^%t was his job and this album gives us samples of those best Carlin moments."
5,Heavy Influence.,"I used to watch George Carlin a lot when I was a kid. We regarded him as being quite risqué (lol) but today, I must admit, his brand of humor seems rather dated. What we have to remember with Carlin is that he was a forerunner, and this DVD really makes you realize the type of influence he had on the great comedians of our day--particularly Jerry Seinfeld. He was a giant of the observational method, and laid the ground upon which many a great career has traversed. Carlin's delivery is also magnificent. His acting and presence made him transcend what seems to be so-so material. He's no Chris Rock, but he made an enormous contribution to comedy."
3,not for myself,"I really can't review this item. I bought it as a gift for someone else who wanted the weather man bit. So all Ican say is that it was a very good price, and was shipped quickly. I will never see the actual contents."
4,Clever George,It was great to watch these old routines. It was a little choppy jumping back and forth between different snippets. I was also a little disappointed at the qualilty of some of of the video transfers. Still very good overall.
3,"Lame, Limited but Loveable.","What happened to the Hippy, Dippy Weatherman and so many other bits. I loved George Carlin from his start. I remember so much of his bits. 1/2.com has a really much better collection than here in Amazon."
1,out of touch,"It's not only the outdated subject matter of this DVD that proves Carlin's desperately out of touch (pre-Sept. 11 airport security, cigar smoking, angels), it's the hackneyed ""angry-guy"" delivery that truly kills it. Imagine Krusty the Clown driving around in a Canyonero swearing to himself and you've pretty much nailed it. Aficionados of comedy would be far better served with a Bill Hicks, Mitch Hedberg or Dave Attell album; there's nothing relevant to see or hear here."
5,Carlin is a genius,"And, most important, he is honest with people. Do people like it? Probably mot much. But let's face it, he is right..."
2,Don't buy this,"I'm a big fan of George Carlin. But don't buy this electronic copy, you don't really own the video, and you can onlywatch it on Amazon browser on your PC which is no better than watching clips of the show on youtube.Amazon.com was really good with their customer service though, they refunded my money within a few mins when I requested it onlive customer service chat."
5,Great,I love George and so does my nieces boyfriend. He is who I bought it for at Christmas. You just can't go wrong here.
1,Not a DVD!,Although listed as a DVD this disk is for the Hasbro VideoNow PVD format. The disk is smaller than a DVD and recorded in a different manner. It cannot be played in a DVD player.
2,Great while it lasted............,"I got this mp3 player in October. It worked fine, and was a great purchase......up until now. It's all messed up! It only plays some of my songs, and it won't even play some of those songs sometimes. It even skips over most of my music! I'm not buying a creative mp3 player again!"
2,PSHH!!! GET A REAL IPOD!!!,"I was excited when I got it, then a few weeks later, its just collecting dust on my desk.Just get a regular ipod, so it can hold more songs, and it will work better.Also, the back of the zen falls off, and I can't get it back on without taping it.Also, when I try putting new songs on it, it deletes the other ones!!! This really gets me ticked off, because then I have to delete every song on the list and re-download them all on the same playlist.This is complete junk. I only did 2 stars because it worked for 3 weeks. Now it just doesn't work, even with a new battery.Yes, it may be very small and it only costs 50 bucks, but its not even worth 50 bucks!! I rather buy 50 bucks worth of Paris Hilton's albums, and listen to it all day!!! (very bad)"
5,My first MP3 player.,"Well this is my first MP3 player. I was warned about buying an IPod (horribly expensive and horribly corporate) so I opted for something moderately-priced but yet adequate storage. I'm going to see if there is a case for it because honestly I do not like the mp3 player banging around when I am jogging. (It comes with an attachment to a necklace.)Easy enough to connect to your computer, just a USB cable. Have to install the software, it comes with a lot of extra stuff so I just say to install the bare minimum. Downloading songs to and fro is a cinch and takes a few seconds. Great for long car trips or walks. I highly recommend this to a first-time buyer or a casual mp3 user."
3,Its ok....just ok.,"I bought this on a whim, and wish I had put more thought into it. The software was so easy to use, and I had no problems getting music into it (good for people new to downloading and ripping). The things I do not like came when I tried to listen to it. The free music to get me started was not on it, the directions cover 2 features, and not the rest, the ear plugs are huge! I cannot get them in my ears!, and what I think is the worst part of the machine, you can't listen to a song and look at the song list at the same time. If you scroll, you are playing music while you are scrolling, it does not stop, or allow you to pick another sing while listening to another. This bugs me. I will get new ear things, and use it, but I wish I had done my homework."
1,Don't buy this mp3,"This player is a bad product all around. The battery cover broke after just 2 wks. Also, it only holds about 100 songs. The customer service is a total hassel, and very unhelpful. Now, no matter how many songs I take off of it, I can't get it to download any more. You are better off just getiing an Ilo or Lyra."
2,I am buying a new mp3 player :(,"Well first of all it hurts my ears whenever I listened to it, which was annoying, and they kept falling out of my ears! Then the battery cover fell off 4 weeks after using it. So I taped it back on but then it got all dirty. Then, I took it to school one day, for the end of the day because I walk home, and it started playing during class! And it was in my purse without anything touching it. I would suggest getting a regular ipod mini."
4,Nano (not plus) to replace an N200,"I lost my N200. Purchased the Nano to replace.I was happy with the N200, I'm happy with the Nano.The headphones are the same. Will be replaced with $10 headphones.The Nano doesn't have the rubber carrying case or the armband that came with the N200. This is a bummer; I really wanted the case (still have the armband).The nano has a microphone. I think the recording is a little better than the N200.It does not have FM tuner. Not a problem for me. The FM tuner on the N200 wasn't bad, but I'll use a mini radio if that's what I want.It feels fragile...but I dropped the N200 enough to know that it isn't. The buttons have a different tactile feedback than the N200."
5,Creative Zen,Works just like you would want a tiny MP3 player to work. Very well laid out unit. I am very happy!
4,Very helpful!!!!!,"This book was the very first book I ever got when I took the first big step of deciding I wanted to teach myself Japanese. I found the pronunciation guide helpful, although at a glance, it was hard to understand. For every subject they mention, however, they give great dialogue and explanations of certain words, cultural differences, etc. I was 14 when I began reading this book, and was able to understand it very well. However, being on my own with this language had its downfalls, for when I actually got into a classroom, I found I had the pronunciation a little off, but I was able to pick up very quickly on the hiragana and katakana writing systems, sentence structure, and vocabulary. This is a great beginner's book!!!!"
2,Not very useful at all.,"If you are a tourist traveling to japan for a short time this book would be useful, but there are several phase books avialable that are about one sixth the size with more information inside. When I first red this book I had been living in japan for 2 months and I found most of the information not very useful.This book has pictures that you can easily do without and they are just a waste of space. The font size is almost three times too big so not much information is on each page even though this book is quite large. I found myself having to flip back pages constantly because discriptions of words where on a different page than the actual translation.There is much better books avialable.As someone wanting to learn Japanese I dont recommend this book."
3,Decent Japanese Book,"This book is not the most comprehensive, but it will do if you need to know the basics. If you plan on learning Japanese or visiting Japan for a long period of time then you should probably find something a bit more in depth. It's small size is convenient however if you just want to carry it around or to find simple things quickly."
1,Disapointed!,VERY disapointed! It is only one (1) short for $10; worth about $1. Thought I was buying several Keystone Cop shorts. Wish I had my money back!
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this for my 97 Saturn. The product description said it was 16 inches long. When I removed from box, it was only 13 inches long. Fortunately, I had not cut the old one off yet. Returned to Amazon. Don't know if maybe the wrong converter in the box or just a poor manufacturer. First time with any Wagner products."
1,Does not fit,"The exhaust pipe on the car 2001 ford focus ZTS is 2 inch, this is 1.75 , but no where in the online catalog doe it say the thing will not fit in the location of the original. or that modification of the existing exhaust has to be made. No bolt and clamp here - it must be welded in place -"
5,BEST BONGO AND CONGA PLAYER IN ALL OF HISTORY!!!,"IVE FOLLOWED MR. BONGO'S CARRER FOR YEARS, AND STILL TILL THIS DAY I HAVENT HEARD ANYONE WHO EVEN COMES CLOSE TO HIS VERY UNIQUE SOUND.HE'S THE MASTER OF PERCUSION!"
4,Interesting but biassed,"The theme of the film is essential. It is about conquering independence in African countries that are colonized, here by the English. Must this liberation come through violence or through christian love ? Must this liberation be radical or progressive ? The film answers that christian love is essential, the church must lead this liberation and it must come progressively. We may regret that the point of view of the nationalist forces among Africans are not described in their real terms, contradictions and stakes. The film wants to prove its point and neglects the arguments of the other side, through it has the courage to show that some whites are for the use of pure violence to impose their domination and the exploitation of the natural resources of the country.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,hitting close to home ...,"The lead actor, Sidney Poitier plays a man named Obam.[...]say what ?Although he is nothing like Obama, there are some parallels. He is black, he is a leader, he speaks well.In the movie, the native Africans consider the hawk as their symbol of independence. The word for hawk in African is obam (according to the movie).Hawk, of course, nowadays, signifies WAR.Now, how come THAT has never been mentioned in the media ?This appears to be the one and only movie by this director.Produced by some studio in Britain.The recurrent issue of colonialism and mining appears again here.The question is posed as to whether missionaries are a tool of the church / colonialist empire. It is answered, for the most part, in a way that casts a ""positive"" light on the issue. This is at odds with what I heard in the David Icke interview of African shaman Credo Mutwa.[...]"
2,"good horns, lousy compressor",if you want the deep horn sound like the semi trucks you have to get the compressor with the tank. roughly around $300 but worth every penny. I bought this one to put in the back of the truck for when people decide to tail my bumper. the one if front is for people that are going to slow or cut out in front of me....
3,A Good Book For Someone Just Starting Out,"As several of the other reviewers noted, this book contains a lot of examples of specific individuals. I was hoping more for a book that lays out the Pathwork, with brief notations regarding exercises you can use if you're unsure.It's not that it's a bad book - it's not. It's just not the book I was looking for. But if you are starting out on the path to self-discovery, the examples in the book will most likely be extremely helpful. For me, they were superfluous."
1,Bad Quality,"I'm sure the content is great, but I couldn't get through it on the kindle because the quality was so bad. Words are differing contrast which is very distracting. I don't have this problem with other books. Also, the footnotes/endnotes are not linked. This ebook seems to have been thrown together with little or no effort to quality. At the price point of over $37, that's inexcusable."
5,UNBELIEVABLE PACKAGE,"IF YOU LIKE JOHNNY BURNETTE ARE JUST THINK YOU MIGHT LIKE HIM, ORDER THIS AS FAST AS YOU CAN, LIKE A ROCKU-BILLY-FAST SHOOTING-SON OF A GUN, YOU'LL NEVER REGRET THIS ROCKIN TRIOS BRILLIANCE."
5,100% spoiler-free,"I won't reveal any of the stuff that happens (even though I'm a bit late now). This is one of the best disks in the series, if not THE best. There are many revelations (hence the name of the disk). There is a lot of character development all across the board, particularly with Hibiki and the Paksis. There's still plenty of the same humor, the same action, the same everything.... only it moves VERY fast. They're really setting this series up for one heck of a finale. Any Vandread fan, or any anime fan for that matter, will definately get their money's worth out of this disk. This otaku has spoken."
3,Drilling required,2001 SL Blazer. Had to enlarge the holes to accept the hardware included with this item. It states it no drilling but dont believe it.
4,Carlos does it again,Not his best but still very good. Reading the books in chronological order is best for the reader to help follow.
3,"Interesting tale, but lacking in practice...","Like the rest of Castaneda's works, it lacks any measure of depth in the area of practical considerations. If you want a fine story of the experience of initiation, read his works- if you want to be initiated yourself, look elsewhere. I'd suggest starting with some Peter Carroll."
2,Tale of a Cult,"This book, like the image of Castaneda, is overrated. The prose of this book is very repetitive. Each chapter begins and ends in the same way, giving at the end a moral statment that often is full of contradiction. He writes about a world that he claims to be real but there are too many farfetched passages to beleive the story. He also claims that through following these moral rules, one can achieve immortality like he has, yet we know that he died in 1998. This book seems only to provide, for people who need it, the foundation for a cult."
2,I dislike writing negative reviews,"I dislike writing negative reviews about books, but I see it as a duty to caution people that come after me.I would categorize this book as fantasy. ;-("
1,I can't believe people take this seriously,"This guy samples various quantities of hallucinogenic drugs and writes about his ""visions and revelations"". Yeah right, if I sat around all day taking drugs, I think I'd see God, the Devil, and everything else in between. Writing a book about his experiences and putting a mystic shaman slant on it ensures Castaneda a handsome income pedaling snake oil. Ol' P.T. Barnum was right."
1,Overrated,This book is too complicated and not for everyone. It dables too much with drug references that are quite disturbing. Stay away from this and pick up Dr. Phil's autobiography. Thanks. :)
2,...,"Please be warned, as this CD isn't about the Highwaymen singing together! They've just put some songs that they sing on their own together on one cd!With the music is nothing wrong, but this isn't the Highwaymen we're talking about!There are a few songs on this CD that they claim are being sung by Waylon, but I suspect they aren't, really! I'm not the best Waylon-knower, but I know how he sounds like a bit, and it doesn't even come close!"
2,"Total rip-off, doesn't have anything to do with the Highwaym","Please be warned, as this CD isn't about the Highwaymen singing together! They've just put some songs that they sing on their own together on one cd!With the music is nothing wrong, but this isn't the Highwaymen we're talking about!There are a few songs on this CD that they claim are being sung by Waylon, but I suspect they aren't, really! I'm not the best Waylon-knower, but I know how he sounds like a bit, and it doesn't even come close!"
1,A Rip-Off Indeed.....,"I should have heeded the warnings here. I don't mind so much that this is NOT really the highwaymen together, although I'm not sure that Waylon is singing all the songs attributed to him. But the recording is really poor...it sounds like they recorded it in an echo chamber. I openned the package, played one song and didn't want this anymore. Note that they don't allow you to sample the music online (that should've been a clue for me) and you can't return CD's. Henceforth, if I am not certain of the album quality and can't listen to a preview, I ain't buying it. Period."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was so disappointed with this cd set. The quality of the recording is very low, songs are bad, overall nothing good to say."
1,Songs not sung as Group! Wouldn't buy again!,"I was warned but went ahead and bought it. It is not worth it. Totally dissatisfied.Please be warned, as this CD isn't about the Highwaymen singing together! They've just put some songs that they sing on their own together on one CD! Nothing is wrong with the music, but this isn't the Highwaymen as a group.This is like the cheap 8 tracks sold in carry outs in the 70s not worth the money!"
3,Ehhh.......,"Needed a cheap phone with two criteria: 1) cordless, 2) answering machine. This was it. When I received it, the built immediately looked cheap and flimsy and I was right. The screen that protects the digital screen on the handset fell off. I sticked it back on, waiting for it to fall back any minute so I can superglue it. No problem with phone so far...but I know if it falls on the floor - I'll be looking for a new phone. The manual is a joke - but nothing common sense and time can't solve. What I do like is 3 mailboxes to leave messages, but didn't have time to figure how that works.This time, I got what I paid for...a $20 corldess phone."
2,Living And Dying On Everest,"I purchased this DVD with the intent on being given an explanation on why people continue to risk their lives for such an adventure. I was greatly dissapointed. This DVD gave a sparse and short description of un named people climbing in a very generic way. Nothing new or exciting. I expected more, or even some griping detail of the hazards. I didn't get much I'm sorry to say."
2,Living and Dying On Everest DVD,"Not long enough, felt like this was the quick tv version, found myself wanting more detailed info and content"
3,Maybe mine was a lemon.,"I used this fan camping only one time. The fan is very quiet and displaces lots of air, but I noticed on low speed that its speed would fluctuate. The next moring, i noticed that the plastic housing had started to melt around the switch. Could be a fire hazard even using 8D batteries. Returned to the store."
3,Time to Updat again,"I used to enjoy idly looking through the database augmenting my knowledge. Unfortunately I updated to Windows XP and now I can't look at it at all. Come on MacMillan, not only do you need to update the Encylopeadia to include the latest DS9 and Voyager, but you need to make it compatible with Windows XP!"
3,Pretty good,"This thing was amazing when it was first published as the Omnipedia...it had guided tours through certain subjects narrated by Mark Lenard, voice activated response a la the TV show for computers with the capability, high quality, for the time, videos. This version, though, is outdated, and getting more so, the videos and pics are still low-res by newer standards, and everything in it's ""episode by episode"" guide is available on the ST web site. In fact, the episode synopses are word for word from there, and the previews are available there too.The entries, as I said, are getting outdated, and there's no more nifty tours or voice activation or even simple ""search for entries with video"" function anymore. When all the Trek series are over and they have a chance to completely update this thing, then good. Until then, I'd recommend leaving it alone and maybe buying the book."
4,The Final Frontier?,"The latest version of The STAR TREK Encyclopedia leads fans on a wonderful trip of all things TREK...although I question it's ability to be considered an up to date version of the compendium...it is entertaining enough to use as a resource material, especially involving certain episode specific adventures. The video streams are also extremely entertaining!"
2,A lot of questions I would already know the answer to...,so why would I ask? A lot of the questions I would know because my teenager would already had that experience such as being in boy/girl scouts. There were also some questions I wouldn't even ask my teenager and there were some questions that were excellent for conversation starters. Some questions may be more appropriate for a young teen while other questions may be more appropriate for an older teen.
5,great,I received an item that looked different from the picture. The seller was great he made contact with me right away he took care of the situation and everything worked out!
3,Entertaining I suppose,"Depends on how you look at it. The nude portion did not really have much to do with aerobics. If all you wanted to see were nude women performing squats, etc. then you would probably like it. If you thought you were getting a video showing a real aerobic workout session in the nude...forget it. Definately different, but not what I expected."
1,Boring.,What can I say? Boring. Oh... I need 5 more words to publish the review... Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring!
3,Could have been a lot better,"The nude part goes for 1 hour and then there is another hour where they do basically the same moves with clothes on. The camera angles get very annoying after a while as, for some strange reason, there is a tendency to focus on the knee, or the small of the back, or the top of the head and so on. The camera shots from above get quite annoying after a while!The 'close up' extra's are good but mainly repeats in slo-mo of stuff already on the tape. The vision is clear and fairly sharp. The music is average. The photo gallery is OK.All things considered this was a wasted opportunity for much of the show.Oh, and the actual exercises are a bit strange and I'm not sure that many of them would be used in a normal aerobics class (wouldn't recommend following this to get fit, more as a warm up)"
2,needs more,This was a short workout video. It needed to have more women and better close ups with better lighting. The women in the video were OK but it would have been nice to see it filmed in a real life exercise studio setting rather than in a production studio. After about 15 min it was boring to see the same women over and over. There could have been a better selection of women other than all Caucasian with large (fake) breasts and way too much pubic hair. Not sure I learned anything about aerobics.
2,Totally nude is totally boring,"I thought this would be a little like the old videos from the early 80s. It's not. The ""exercises"" are not very meaningful or sensual. Either clothed or not.I would not recommend this for either an exercise DVD or a turn on. It's not."
2,Disappointed,"Awkward at best. I have to admit, I was looking for a real workout DVD with nude instructors. This is not it. Even if you are just looking for naked girls that like to hop in place, this will not satisfy you."
3,ok but not bad,"This video was pretty ok and kinda hot. I was getting dizzy from the camera moving around too much. There wasn't much stillness, just alot of rotating camera movement. the girls were awesome. They were all hot! One thing that amazed me was that throughout the whole video, the girls are moving and exercising the whole time, which was amazing, and the exercise they do are very beneficial as well. This video would make a great gift to a guy or maybe a girl, what the heck! Have fun watching :)"
4,liked it,much better than the other videos.. and has close up sections in bonus click...plus has the clothed version too
1,Other titles in the series,"Although I watched this video in rapt delight. (don't ask what that means) It was not the best in the series, the ""Totally Nude Gardening"" was much better, especially the roto-tilling scenes. The ""Totally Nude Cooking was okay, but watching her cut vegetables mostly long zuchinis made me think of John Bobbit.But the best was ""Totally Nude Tax Preparation"", which made me want to look for any hidden tax write offs and truly gave meaning to tax loophole"
2,There are better.,It is similar to other videos made by the great Ron Harris (StarShapes) but does not have the quality and closeups you would expect from him.
1,Too Dark,Half the movie is looking through a screen and the rest was to dark to see what was going on !
1,No Stars,"Junk. No Instructor. Bad home video camera. I enjoyed ""Nude Cardiovascular Workout"" video, but this one [was bad]. Got my money back."
3,about this title totally nude Aerobics....,"Attractive girls, June 6, 2003Reviewer: A viewer from MA United StatesOf course, it's not aerobics, but anyway I did not expect it. Just very nice girls (especially jumping one). I would put 5 stars if it was real aerobics with attractive (naked!) instructor.Since there are some who give their comment as this is erotic and they are probably teaching how to have sex in the air either....never mind take this like a dream."
2,I worked in a bioenergetic facility,"I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved. Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?). But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic. As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil. As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor!"
4,Good value,"I love the color! It is really a basic coffee pot (the clock does not even light up) but after looking for one, unsuccessfully, at the local retail stores, I was glad to find one online for the price."
2,A Non Preformer,"When asked about this coffee maker all my wife could say is ""bad, bad, bad it leaks when pouring. I couldn't believe that the carafe was never checked for leakage at the point of manufacture."" The pause and pour feature was also a non performer. Last but not least the water receptacle part of the maker was too small to be easily accessible. Perhaps the only positive feature of the Hamiliton Beach Coffeemaker was it did keep the coffee hot in the carafe. It was also attractive looking."
3,not so good,"I bought this for a gift for a friend. There is a problem with the carafe leaking around the plastic part at the top. She called the company and was told that there is a defect in the red, green and taupe models. She is still awaiting a resolution."
2,Very disappointing,"First of all, this machine is enormous. I had to rearrange my countertop to accommodate it, and it's so tall that I have to pull it all the way forward and turn it to the side in order to fully open the lid. The housing is cheap, bendable plastic. The worst part is that the carafe leaks badly between the red plastic rim and the glass. Could this thing be any more cheaply made? I doubt it! I really like my Hamilton Beach blender and thought the coffee maker would be of equal quality. NOT. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good buy and its red,"This unit works great ,brews agod fast cupa joe. I would recomend it to all!!!!"
4,Ole redhead,"My husband wanted a red coffee maker, as I have apple kitchen acessories.Our son researched and found this one. The appearance is a 5 star as is the quality. As another reviewer had stated the rim around the pot makesit difficult to clean/empty completely. The opening for the water would bemore convient if a bit larger. The lid to water and coffee basket is largeand prevents it setting under the cupboard. I like the easy to obtainpaper filters, no mess just toss. The coffee tastes good and it is so niceto see a happy coffee pot first thing in the morning.Amazon service isgreat."
5,Love it!,"I don't drink a lot of coffee but I was very tired of coffee pots that leaked. This coffeemaker has a pot that doesn't leak. It also is very easy to program and makes a great cup of coffee. Now when I actually want to have good coffee from a coffee maker that isn't sitting in a puddle because the coffee pot leaked when I poured it, I can!"
2,flimsy,"Ok, I ordered this coffee maker. What arrived is a cheap and flimsy piece of plastic, it looks just like the garbage it is, if you know what I mean. It also arrived broken. The top does not sit flat. Ok, I went to return it, it was a marketplace order.It turns out I must ASK for a RMA number (as in beg for permission to return it) and they want to keep 10% for a *re-stocking charge*.These are not the predatory retail policies we have come to expect from amazon.com and I am surprised they allow it.Do not buy from Today's Concept marketplace retailer"
4,A HOT COFFEE MAKER FROM AMAZON,"I BOUGHT THIS HAMILTON BEACH #43253 BBECAUSE MY OLD ONE QUIT HEATING THE COFFEE. THIS MODEL HAD ALL THE USUAL WHISSLES AND BELLS AND THEY WORK. BEST OF ALL IT DOES KEEP YOUR COFFEE A LITTLE HOTTER THAN MOST OTHER MODELS I HAVE TRIED. COLOR IS DIFFERANT AND GOES WELL WITH THE KITCHEN. OVERALL YOU CAN'T ASK MORE FROMA COFFEE MAKER OTHER THAN IT WORKS, KEEPS THE COFFEE HOT, AND MAKES WELL BREWED COFFEE. ONLY CON IS THAT THEY DON'T PUT THE OPTIONAL WATER FILTERS IN WITH THE MACHINE FROM THE STSART. THEY REALLY MAKE A DIFFERANCE IF YOUR TAP WATER IS JUST SO SO. FARIR PRICE, GOOD QUALITY, AND GOOD PERFORMANCE MAKE THIS A SAFE BUY. AMAZON CAMETHROUGH AGAIN."
3,Clean Lines and hot coffee,"There are cheaper coffeemakers that are just as high in quality,but if color is important or modern design it's worth the extra. My saister was,and is several months later,thrilled with it.and is several months later"
2,coffeemaker,"I love the color of the coffee maker. I wanted red in my kitchen. I have not been able to use the coffee maker because when I put in the water to make the coffee, only a small amount of water comes out, there is steam coming out and then just a small amount of water is in the coffee maker. Don't know where the water goes. I have emailed the company but have not gotten any response. I don't know if part of the maker is missing or what. I would love to be able to make coffee but so far, not able too."
4,Hard to beat for the price,We replaced our Kitchen Aid that went on the fritz after 18 months use. The HB costs half as much and so far it has worked well with daily use for the past two months.
5,Hamilton Beach 12-cup Coffeemaker,"Needed new coffeemaker, and this one came in red (perfect shade) to complement new kitchen color scheme. Nice featres--clock, program to automatically switch on in AM for coffee. Coffee is good and hot. I am very pleased with this product."
5,wonderful,I just got this and it is not only beautiful it works wonderful. Thanks hamilton beach for making a wonderful coffee pot.
2,Worked fine for 6 months,"This replaced a Mister Coffee. Worked great for 6 months,now the timer on and off is erratic as is brew button,tried a reboot,no joy.Guess I'll try a GE next."
2,Highly disappointed,"If you're a coffee snob, this is NOT the pot for you. I'd been looking at this coffee maker for over a year, reading all the reviews, and decided my husband might like it. Now that I own it, I wish I'd never gone near it. My husband has had nothing but complaints with this coffee maker ever since the day it arrived. (Luckily I drink tea and don't have to use it.) Poor design, ugly color--more like a maroon rather than hot red like everyone said it was, and the length of the cord is a joke--way too short which makes filling the pot with water impossible. Don't be fooled into buying this by the other reviews for this product. This is a lame excuse for a coffee maker. Spend a little more money and get something of value."
5,Great Coffee Maker,"This is a great coffee maker for a bargain price. Not a lot features, just a clock and timer. The controls are all near the top of the madhine which makes them easy to see and the clock is actually readable. The bright red color with the stainless steel face plate is a real standout in my kitchen."
1,leaks,"product is cheap, thin plastic, and it leaks! not as good as others in their line. think twice!"
1,Leaky Pot,"As others said, the carafe leaked. The manufacturer said to return it for a replacement. I didn't want to gamble again, so it was returned for credit. I bought a Braun which is much nicer."
4,Coffee,I really like this coffee pot it makes good coffee and I am a coffeeholic I love coffee. It keeps the coffee hot until it shuts off and does not burn it. This is the 3rd Hamilton Beach coffee pot I have owned and they have lasted a long time.
2,Red coffee maker,"It's Okay, not as good as the Kenmore Red coffee maker. A little slow on making coffee, other than that it's okay."
2,Pretty Red Coffmaker,"I bought this because my kitchen colors are red and yellow, the name brand and some of the reviews. I was disappointed and returned it. I could not get my coffee hot enough or strong enough. I tried several times but my morning coffee is very important to me! I bought the Quisinart and am very satisfied. One of the reviews said the opening to fill the water is too small - I did not find this to be true. I love everything about this. It brews a really hot cup of coffee, requires a standard ratio of coffee to water, it is easy to progrem and it is red!"
4,Nice coffee maker,I wanted a red coffee maker to replace my very old one and this one had good reviews. I've had it for a couple weeks and so far so good. No complaints.
4,Hamilton Beach Red Coffee Pot,"This is an attractive and easy to use coffee pot. I love the color. The coffee is hotter than it is with other electric coffee pots. I was surprised that it had a basket filter; I had expected a cone filter which I think makes more flavorful coffee. But, by adding a bit extra (Peets) coffee, I have been able to achieve the strength and flavor that I like. I think the type of filter should have been disclosed on Amazon in description of the product."
5,Excellent coffee maker for the price.,"This coffee maker not only looks pretty, it really makes a great cup of coffee. It's very easy to program."
3,Coffee maker is ok,"As other reviews state, pouring the water into the reservoir is tricky until you get the hang of it. I also am disappointed that the clock is not better illuminated -- you can't see it at all in the dark. But, it does make a good, hot cup of coffee!"
3,"overall, i guess it's good","I purchased this coffee maker a little over a year ago.. and here I sit writing a review on it because it's just about ready to die on me. It's 9:37 in the morning, and i clicked this puppy on at 9:20.. it's STILL brewing.. As a matter of fact it's not even up to the 3rd cup line yet. Problem is, I need a new coffee maker and this is one of the only affordable red ones out there. I know there will be problems in the future with it, but it's no biggy, I'm still going to buy it again. Right now..."
5,Good coffee ready to wake me,"It is so nice to have the coffee ready when I come down in the AM, It has been a lot nicer than I expected. I should have gotten one of these when I bought my last machine."
2,Cheap materials,"We bought this coffee maker thinking how bad could it be? we just want a cup of coffee, nothing fancy. The cheap plastic arm that holds the filter in place is annoying and poorly designed. It has to be held out of the way to remove the filter. Ours has now broken after 6 months. We will now be looking for a better designed coffeemaker."
2,Non-stick will not be non-stick for long,"I have had this coffee maker for 3 months. At first, I really enjoyed the features and thought I had found a great coffee maker. Within 3 weeks, the non-stick surface started flaking off, and now I have no non-stick surface at all. If you want a good coffee maker for a few months, get this one but be prepared to go shopping for another one."
1,Cheap...and Cheap!,"Worked fine until I needed to take the lid off the carafe to run it thru the dishwasher, after which the top of the carafe could not be re-snapped into the carafe...and, with subsequent attempts, finally broke the plastic insets. Now the carafe won't hold the lid. Great! New product, bad engineering, broken within a week. Bad purchase!"
3,Hamilton Beach Red Coffeemaker,"I read the stellar reviews on this product before I bought it. Unfortunately, I have a couple of negatives...the coffeemaker is too high to easily fit under my cupboard and use, so I have to pull it out and turn it sideways in order to pour in the water. Even though it brews coffee in lick-split time, the coffee strength is not as strong as my previous coffeemaker. I'm afraid that the water may be going through the grounds too fast. I'm using much more coffee than I did before."
1,Hamilton Beach 43253 Ensemble 12 Cup Coffeemaker,"Hamilton Beach 43253 Ensemble 12-Cup Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Redfive months later - red lid came off. Plastic. Can't get it back on. Too bad. I loved it"
4,"A great coffeemaker for the price, with a couple of flaws","Got this coffeemaker when my long-standing (but no longer manufactured) Braun died. I liked the price, and the color, and the reviews were generally good. This coffee maker has made consistently good coffee, and looks great on the counter. My biggest issue with it is the time display (clock, pre-set timer for the morning): it's so dim it's almost impossible to read (especially when trying to decide is the timer is set to AM or PM). This might be this particular machine, though, who knows? Not so bad worth returning but annoying. I like the round ""Mr. Coffee-shaped"" coffee filter (versus the cone-shaped my last one used). The water-fill section is a bit small and awfully close to where you put the grounds, so be careful, but overall the machine is cleverly-built and the coffee perks quickly and tastes great. I'd recommend it, especially for the price (I paid about 45 bucks on sale at Amazon)."
1,bad apliance,got this for my wife on x mas had it for a month it was working ok slow then out of the blue the caraff cracked on the bottomive had many coffee makers and this one is by far the worst one. i will not bye any more of these products from hamalton beachand i dont recomend that anybody bye one there are better ones for the same price. hope this saves somebody from a really badmorning of waking up and no darn coffee....
1,The worst coffee maker ever!,"This coffee maker is a piece of crap. I've had it about 3 years, and it's already past it's prime. Though i'm not sure it ever had one. I really loved the color of this...but that's it! It's not easy to clean, it COOKS the coffee on the hot plate...the coffee gets strong within 15 mins! I will NEVER buy another Hamilton Beach product ever again!"
2,Not strong enough,"I had been looking for a coffee pot for months before purchasing this one. Before I had a little coffee pot that was only big enough for one person to use but it was great, when I read the reviews for this one I had extremely high expectations. This coffee pot for some reason does not give me strong enough brewing power, the coffee is weak and almost translucent. Very disappointing, next time I will go with my original brand"
3,Pretty to look at but not practical,"I bought this coffee maker for my parents. It is GREAT looking, was easy to set up and all, but it's somewhat of a pain to use... Let me start off by saying the coffee tastes GREAT... better than out of some fancier machines...However, to use it, the ENTIRE top lifts up. To remove the basket, you actually have to swing the water spout arm to the side to remove the basket with old grinds & rinse, and you have to add the water in the back which is difficult to get to if the coffee maker is on a countertop w/ cupboards above...Designing it so that the entire top lifts up is strange compared to every other coffee maker I've used..."
1,Short life span,"Several mounting problems in short time. #1: Purchased just under 2yrs ago and it just died. Started slowing down with brew time about 3 mo ago. Properly cleaned. #2: The swingaway water brew sprout and small water fill area make it difficult to fill. #3: The small nub-nipples holding the carafe lid, (1) broke off within 2 months, (no harsh treatment) to cause it. Another few reviews mentioned same problem. All in all for $40+, I think it should have lasted a bit longer."
4,Love it!,Beautiful well-designed coffee pot. One star less for filter. Unusual and directions hard to read for how to install. Does anyone know how this works? Will give a star back if you can tell me this.
5,A Great Buy,This Hamilton Beach 43253 truly has a non-drip carafe. It makes good hot coffee. It is far better than my expensive Cuisinart.
3,Dont order online buy from store!,This coffee maker works fine but the light on the clock doesn't work. Too much trouble to ship back to get a new one. So best to buy at a local store so you can take it back easier if your light doesn't work.
2,This is not a red coffee pot!,"I have wanted a red coffee pot since Christmas. Seems like everyone in the nation sold out. I was excited to order a red coffee pot online. Much to my disappointment, it is fuchsia or pink. It is not red at all! By the time I send it back and pay for shipping and pay for shipping for another one, I feel as though it becomes pointless and a waist. I am highly disappointed in color description and the way it appears online as it is deceiving. If you want a red coffee pot, order something else. The coffee is fine, nothing special, but it works. it perks fairly fast, not allowing much time to really absorb the coffee bean richness."
2,How Hard is a Carafe?,"Carafe #1: Leaked. There is a plastic collar on the carafe that was not glued well to the glass so when I poured it leaked out, down the outside and dribbled on the counter. HB cheerfully sent me a new one.Carafe #2: Lid broke. Again with the plastic collar. The lid snaps into it, only it doesn't. Before I figuged it out, I had broken the flimsy plastic studs that the lid hinges on. HB cheerfully sent me a new one.Carafe #3: Lib broke again. I was ever so careful to keep from breaking off those flimsy plastic studs but I apparently breathed on it wrong and they broke again. HB would probably send me another one but I really need to get on with my life.BTW: It takes FOREVER (25 minutes for 10 of 12 cups) to brew."
2,Design Flaw,"First off, I never even brewed a pot of coffee with this coffee maker. When trying to fill the reservoir, the area to pour the water in is so small, I ended up with water everywhere. It splashes through the filter area and comes down onto the hot plate, then down the counter and then onto the floor. I just threw it back in the box and I intend to return it.Also, some other person mentioned about the plastic clips on the lid being really cheap. He's right!! They look like they can break real easily."
4,Like the red but can do without,"We were happy with this coffee pot for about two years. I've already replaced it! I liked everything except where you put the water in. Could have had more room there. Otherwise, it worked okay. Hard to see the time."
5,Dar,I really like my Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker.It work really well the coffee taste good.The color is just perfict and I am pleased with the coffeemaker..It arrived in about three working days that was great...Dar
3,Hamilton Beach will not return my calls or answer my e-mails!,"I bought this coffeemaker 5 mos ago. I love the coffeemaker, but the lid to the carafe broke. There are 2 little plastic nubs that keep the lid on. It is still under warranty, but I cannot get anyone to help me! You cannot talk to a person. I do not reccomend buying anything made by this company!"
2,Red Coffee Maker,Loved the color but the Coffee Maker leaked the first time we used it. Amazon was great about a return but couldn't purchase another Red coffee maker since they were out.
2,Good enough--don't get attached to it,"I've owned this unit for about 6 weeks. Last week it started making horrendous noises as it's brewing. I've checked for clogs, I've run 12 c. of plain water through it. I can't figure it out. Unfortunately, I threw the box away so I'm stuck with it. I don't expect it to last long--with all the noise it making--it's bound to fail sooner than later. Other than that; it's pretty, it's not expensive. It hasn't leaked. It is tall, you do have to be careful pouring the water into the reservoir or it will pour out the bottom. The small paper basket filters--well, be careful pouring in the ground coffee or you'll be cleaning grounds up from everywhere. Still searching for the ultimate (but not exorbitant) coffee pot."
4,Huna Code In Religions,"Long seems to have something to prove with this book. He does convey the idea of the universality of Huna, and compares it to many other cultures and religions. Referring constantly to the Hawaiian language, he makes a strong case about interconnected cultures and common ideas. To truly understand the different dimensions - literal, metaphorical, and etheric - of the Hawaiian language, this book is a great reference tool. However, without serious study, much of the information is too technical to really remember. A good book, but needs to be read in short segments.Spirit Journeys: Freeing the Soul in this Life and Beyond,Healing Thoughts: Applying Therapeutic Shamanism in Your Daily Life"
5,White baking dish with handles,This small white baking dish with handles is just the size and type that I needed for my baking needs. The style of the dish is suitable for baking and serving even on a formal setting.
4,good item - was smaller than I thought,"This is a nice item - good quality. It is smaller than I thought it would be. Other than that, I have no issues"
2,Once you bake in it you will have a stain for life,Unfortunately once you bake in these it stains and will not come off so it is no longer oven to table wear.
3,Audio,"Audio has a very washed out sound which makes it hard to understand it at times. The content of the video is actually really good, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the history of the Bible."
5,How the Bible Came to Us,"The late Ken Connolly goes on location to many important historic places to tell the story of the English Bible. You will hardly find a set of videos with such a wealth of synthesized material. I first purchased this set when it first was released on VHS tape. It was a tremendous blessing. This version lacks the audio quality of the VHS tape series, but the content is well worth looking past that. If you are a new Christian or just beginning to study the Reformation and the bible this series will single-handedly catapult you into a new level of historical understanding. Watch it often and with your children (if you have them). Probably few videos ever produced carry the impact of this 4 part series. It is an invaluable resource."
2,Audio Faulty,Data may be great but couldn't get pass the audio. And why should I when I have so many other choices?
2,Flawed by Misinformation,"As a teacher I am always looking for good historical fiction. As a teacher of Muslim children I was delighted to discover A Blood Red Horse. The author skillfully melds the common humanity of both Crusaders and Muslim defenders through their shared love of a remarkable horse.Although Ms. Grant treats her Muslim subjects with dignity and empathy, she exhibits an ignorance of basic Islamic beliefs and practice. Her errors will be obvious to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of the religion.Readers of historical fiction, whether adults or children, are entitled to more than just a ""good read."" A well-crafted historical novel is based on a foundation of carefully researched background information. The author who fails to verify some of the facts casts doubt on the validity of the rest of the research on which the novel is based."
2,OK,has a lot of history many of good facts but several unrealistic twists. I am a rider (of horses) and found Grant had a good overall knowledge of horses except the with the red pony it is slightly unrealistic in that boys are leading wars too. But if you relax and ignore some of the solutions it is ok at best
1,A very disappointing book,"My daughter was assigned this book as summer reading between 6th and 7th grade. Here is her review: This book was very disappointing. The author does not develop the characters at all. The book is mainly about a medieval crusade. Don't be misled by the cover which says "" two boys , one girl, an adventure of a lifetime"", because the girl doesn't even come on the crusade. Dont think that the title means the book will be about a horse. The title of the book should be called "" the bloody red crusade"". If you want a book about horses, READ A DIFFERENT BOOK!!! Every time you turn the page, a horse or a person dies. This is a gory book about war. DONT READ IT!!! Dont waste your time and money."
2,It was a disappointment,I ordered the wrong book and found this to not be what I wanted. My own fault but I didn't enjoy reading it and never finished it which is extremely rare for me.
5,Outstanding,"After reading Blood Red Horse, I have passed it on to my ten-year-old grandson, who calls me every night to talk about it. He's a tough customer, and would rather re-read Harry Potter for the umpteenth time than chance something boring. Blood Red Horse has him in its grip. He's learning that people delude themselves, they make good and bad choices, even kings and sultans. They get badly hurt. They change. Best of all, he's learning that war is never holy, no matter how it's justified. He's learning that simple assumptions about our own or other people's religions are rarely right -- beliefs are very complex. He's learning about the value of honor, of mercy, of joining together to save something precious. We are waiting for Green Jasper to arrive so I can read it before he finishes Blood Red Horse!"
2,not what I ordered,"I ordered the 550.4400 which is the EXECUTIVE model of this phone.The message screen on the EXECUTIVE phones are twice the size and thephones have an specific auto forward feature not included on the standard version.Need the phones so we kept them - not happy to ""settle""."
4,Collage Says It All!,"Karrin Allyson is an excellent singer and the musicians on this cd are the best, having heard a few of them ""live"" as well as having some of them performing on other recordings. That said, I know I'll regret this BUT I suppose my musical taste (at least in what I prefer to buy) is not that eclectic. If I prefer jazz, then I wouldn't expect to hear folk anymore than buying folk would I expect to hear jazz. If I want a mixture, I'll listen to the radio! Please keep my Thelonious Monk, Cole Porter, Clifford Brown and Jay Leonhart (an excellent bassist who writes some very amusing songs) separated from Billy Joel and Bonnie Raitt who are excellent in their type of music.....but just not my gig!"
2,"fun uptempo tunes, but didn't enjoy the pop and droopy ballads","I bought this record after hearing Allyson sing O Pato (not on this disc) on the radio. That tune showed that she could scat like crazy, had a great sense of humor, and a great sense of rhythm. Those qualities are all on display on this disc, but only on the fast tunes. I really, really could have done without the Beatles and Billy Joel songs, and several of the droopy ballads. I ended up deleting tracks 2, 3, 5, 9, and 12. I would have been happier having saved some money and bought tracks 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 individually. If you like real jazz that swings, cooks, and sambas, I suggest you listen to snippets of the different tracks before laying out the money to buy this record as a whole."
1,"Wonderful Songs, but nothing else","I was recommended this by a friend. I had never heard of Mr. Rebroff, and now I know why. I expected a talented, trained singer. If Mr. Rebroff is, it doesn't show in this recording.A waste of money. There are so many wonderful singers out there with REAL talent."
1,Would not install on Core 2 Duo,Could not get this to install on either of my Core 2 Duo systems. Just locked up the system.
1,DID NOT PLAY,"I installed this game with no problems, but it does not play on my BRAND NEW LAPTOP (Intel Core2Duo 2.2GZ processor, Nvidia Geforce 8600GT video card, 2GB RAM, 120GB hard drive). I am playing Doom 3 with no problems, so the problem must be with this game rather than my computer. It keeps closing on me with an .exe error. Not worth the $$ I paid for it, that is for sure. I will steer cleer of games I have never heard of from now on.Overall = Disappointing"
3,Almost cuts it,The Zen fits into the Armband very tight. The wrong movement if the Zen isn't in lock mode will cause the buttons to be pushed. Almost does not fit around my arm and within two uses the small velcro spots on the band popped off. I guess just not rugged enough for my application.
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made?,"Forget about Plan 9 From Outer Space, Fred Watkins torpiddrama, A Matter of Honor takes the award as worst film of all time.This turkey is so slow it creeps along even in fast foward. Nothing more than a vanity piece by producer Craig Cosgray. Even TV's SHAZAM can't save this... END"
3,Captain Marvel in o.k. indy film,"This film has Captain Marvel (Jackson Bostwick) as the professor/rugby coach doing a believable job. Some of the dialogue is very over the top by Writer/Producer Craig Cosgray and the lead female should get another career..others in the cast do good jobs..cinematography and most of the director's work is very good, hindered by lead female and dialogue...some of the songs suck bad but the composed score is excellent by Kris Carter who writes for Batman and Beyond and several other tv shows and films (see imdb). All in all I think the Director Fred Watkins did the best he could with what he was given by the Writer/Producer. Couple of nice rugby action shots.."
5,HEY HEY HEY,"#1: Lose My Breath is the only fast club song on the album, but I'm not upset. They're becoming adults, well, hell, they've been adults, they've just been waiting for Beyonce, but ""Destiny Fulfilled"" is straight R&B;, nothing else.01. Lose My Breath (10/10) - Love the song. It's a breath of fresh air.02. Game Over (10/10) - People, you are not ready for this song. It has that ""Maybe it's time we should make up, baby."" vibe. Basically saying to the one you love, can't nobody do me like you, the game is over. I love this song so much. I wish it could've been on ""Fulfilled"" because I was pissed that there were only 11 songs on the album that that's ok. I will remain a dedicated fan until whenever. Anyway, this single is the bomb and I hope you feel the same way I feel about ""Game Over.""Enjoy people and make sure you carry yo' @ss to the store and buy that album!"
1,real generic,"I still ain't heard much from Destiny's Child that hits yet. this is another safe Hit,but the vocals&Lyrics aren't catchy like some of there other stuff that they have done.I still don't understand why (...)would leave a Solo Career for material that is truly just kinda there."
5,Offering ways to improve one's performance,"Book On Acting: Improvisation Technique by acting coach, teacher, and directory Stephen Book (long-time faculty member of The Juilliard School and the University of Southern California) is a ""user friendly"" handbook written especially anyone who serious aspires to becoming professional actors in film, theater, and television. Offering ways to improve one's performance with both scripted and memorized lines, and covering everything from using improvisation to liven one's monologues or improving one's chances at an audition in better displaying conflict, agreement, etc. on camera, Book On Acting: Improvisation Technique is an excellent and confidently recommended single volume instructional resource."
1,An Absolute Travesty on a great Talent,"I used to have all of Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66... albums. When I saw they were doing a tribute to Sergio I thought it was about time. Unfortunately it was the wrong time and the wrong talent. They have taken Sergio's classics and made them tripe, most of which has an undercurrent of rap. I suppose there is something to be said about the Brazilian indian chants like Ye Me Le from the album of the same name being brazilian rap, but I will not say it. If you have money to burn, waste, or spend friously then by all means buy this CD, but if you appreciate the talent and the warm of may tempos that graced Sergio Mendes' beautiful music stay away from this piece of you know what. Perfection should never be messed with, and that is what this CD is a mess."
2,OK for the background,"The beats and instrumental aspects of the remixes are just fine, even good, but the rap is too simplistic for a serious listen. This stuff works as hip party background music where you've got enough people noise to quell Will I Am. Not on your car or your ipod where you'll actually have to listen to him."
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...you cannot mash the old (Sergio) with the new (Will.i.am & company) and be successful if you can't keep the spirit of the original and yet give it a fresh sound. They missed the bossa nova boat.
2,I Love Brazilian Music but...,"While I am glad to see Bossa Nova and Tropicalismo make a push toward the commercial market in the U.S. again, the recording is not satisfying to me because the spirit of the music is lost with imposed rhythms that make no sense in context. Hip Hop and club beats just don't work very well with this music. They sound rather awkward and generic compared to the great variety of authentic Brazilian rhythms... like putting monster truck tires on a Porsche. Perhaps the best cut is Berimbau because it is sung by a Brazilian. You have to appreciate David Byrne more after this project. Sergio - please put out a real Brazilian music CD!"
5,What a treat.......,"Growing up with Srgio Mendez and Brasil 66 has been such a gift. Their music has always inspired and mesmorized me. Although no one compares with Lani Hall's voice, this CD is really on. This CD is such a treat, I love it. One side note, I could do withought all the rap."
5,Smooth and fiery,Love this CD...the latin beats are filled with the vocals of some of the most inspiring r& b artist
5,A timeless classic,"It's outstanding from start to finish. I loved the collaborations done with WillIam, Stevie Wonder, Black Eyed Peas, Justin Timberlake, etc.. It was definitely worth the price."
4,World Cup commercial leading to excellent album...,"I have always liked Sergio Mendes and the song, Mas Que Nada, but after seeing the excellent Nike commercial/Joga Bonita (Play beautiful)with the Brazilian team to this new mix... Had to immediately get it. Now I have the entire CD and I love it. Hopefully, it will introduce an entire new generation to Sergio's music. I predict a HUGE hit for this new version of Mas Que Nada and my daughter and I have a bet as to whether this or Gnarls Barkley's ""Crazy"" will be more popular.Enjoy and dance."
4,Bossa Nova Meets hip soul,"I enjoy this CD simply because it mixes some of the best of both genres(Mendes and some of the better artists out today..India,Badu, Legend, Tip, Will I AM, and others..) I think it is certainly worth the buy for any mature listener who can appreciate good music with a feel good bossa nova/soul vibe...One for the roadtrip definitely"
4,great listen,i have enjoyed this album since i bought it. it's a great listen when you're cleaning. all the songs and artist did an excellent job putting this together. it really is a timeless album.
3,Go Sergio! (Go Home Peas...),"The irony here is that the ""timeless"" music on this CD is all done without the assistance of the Peas. Sergio's music is cool, and hearing it behind the Peas drearily rapping on about themselves only makes me want to hear him more on his own. Sergio's music is made for samba and bossa nova, and it's a shame the Peas stomp clumsily over more than half of it."
3,nigelangelo,An exciting mix of samba and R&B. It appeals to both youbng and old and clearly shows the versatility of Sergio Mendes
4,Street meets the bossa beat---4.5 stars,"I didn't like Sergio growing up in the day, I was a Motown fan and couldn't get down with bossa nova or latin beats. ""Timeless"" manages to keep some of the sound of the old Brazil 66 and add some new flavor via Stevie Wonder who was one of my faves back then. Of course, they've brought in John Legend with some new soul. Then, they top that off by bringing in the Black Eyed Peas, who I'd never have thought of, and the concept just works."
2,Not enough Sergio,"Oi!I purchased this CD for one track... MAS QUE NADA, hoping I would discover another gem in the mix..... Nao... nothing else did too much for me, too much of the BEP's and not enough Sergio for my taste. MAS QUE NADA rocks (the video too) but unless you are a real BEP's fan, good luck. Muito coco!Abracos!"
5,danceable upbeat fun,"my sisters listened to sergio mendez and brazil 66 when i was growing up, and i loved their music. now in 2006, this album proves his style, talent and genius are indeed ""timeless"". highly recommned this cd. every song is uniquely great."
2,Mednes is timeless but not this version,This is an updated version of Mendes' earlier recordings make them appeal the younger generations. The added rhythms do not fit well at all with the cooler Latin/jazz/Brazilian beat. The singers aren't that good and their voices do not blend with earlier singers. It is a shame to ruin classic sounds with something that sounds like a rhythm machine on an electronic piano.
1,Some Things Just Shouldn't Be Mixed,"I like Sergio Mendes. I like the Black Eyed Peas. But put them together and you have this mess. Listening to this album actually makes me feel nauseous. Sorry, but apparently some things just shouldn't be mixed."
1,WHY!!!!! For God's Sake Why!!!!!,Did Sergio Mendes run out of money? This can be the only reason for making this mess. Why would anyone in their right minds want to do this. I can't even imagine it. I listened to or should I say I began listening to the first cut then tossed it after 15 seconds. Thank God I do have some of the group's recordings from when they were sane. Please leave the C-Rap at the door.
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"This is one of the worst albums I have heard so far this year! i must say will.i.am does a thorough job in mangling a classic(surfboard). Can't anybody see that anything BEP related is absolute garbage?! I change my mind, this album gets 0 out of 5 stars!Bye."
2,The Printed Appearance of this NEW book is unpleasant,"I just received this recently published book ...I must admit, something just irritates me about books printed in ""Times New Roman"" and print that is justified to the right hand margin causing some sentences to have larger gaps between the words. Just makes for bumpy reading, and that's why you commonly don't see books printed like this. I wish the publisher or author would have chosen a better printed, ""reader-friendly"" appearance.The book might be loaded with awesome information and stories... once my eyes adjust to the format, I'll be able to find out. Until then, I thought I'd let other ""would-be-purchasers"" know what to initially expect after paying ... for a 2002 book with pages that look like they just rolled off of an early 80's computer printer."
5,Groovin' - even if they are Drunk Canadiens!,"This is the bluesiest album Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass ever recorded. From Blue Tag to The Shuffle Boogie Swamp Groove Blue it's a winner. My favorites are The Clarinet is Black and Blue and The Shuffle Boogie Swamp Groove Blue, which is about a twelve minute-long hammond organ feature. I have never, ever got tired of hearing this tune! It also features solos by Rob, I thing Guido and a tenor player. The tenor player almost jumps up on the bar for his solo. This album is worth the money just for this tune- but the others are winners, too. Accept no substitutes! Look for the drunk Mounty (Rob McConnell) on the cover, eh?"
5,Just right,This was just the right size to store and organize our supplements and keep them in reach at the table. Well made and compact
5,Great tea - seems to work,"I bought this tea in an effort to stay well during the winter season. It has proved to be incredibly helpful. I cut down the duration of any illnesses I contracted and was rarely sick. I was afraid that it would have a strong/offensive herb taste, but it is very mild and I actually enjoy the taste."
4,Not necessarily Pike,This is a nice companion to the Opus Magnum but it is neither all Albert Pike nor necessarily 100% genuine.
4,Wish It Explained ASP.NET From A Visual Studio Perspective,"This is a good book that taught the concepts of ASP.NET in an understandable manner. The book uses a freeware product called ""Web Matrix"" to perform the examples. I was using an academic copy of Visual Studio 2003 and was totally confused as I followed along for the first week. Being new to ASP.NET, I didn't know the method of coding an ASP.NET web form using ""codebehind"" until two days after purchasing the book. The book does not discuss this until you get to the appendix. For newbies, information like this should be upfront. So, I spent a few days using Visual Studio.NET like ""notepad"" until I realized that I could code a web form almost like a standard windows form in VB.NET.Since you don't need Visual Studio.NET to create ASP.NET pages explains why 99% of the books that I have encountered about ASP.NET don't teach from that perspective as well. Other than that, it is very good book."
3,Great if you don't have Visual Studio,"Not a bad book. I would recommend this tome to anyone who has not yet been exposed to Visual Studio, because the book assumes you don't own a copy and teaches you using Microsoft's Web Matrix. Although Web Matrix is a powerful tool, Visual Studio is far easier to work with in the long run (and promotes better coding practices as well).The general format and layout of the book is classic Wrox. I own many Wrox books and have substantially enhanced my IT career with these books and highly recommend most of them. This book is no exception and is definitely a beginner's book, covering all the basics and then going in-depth into a few nuts and bolts (but never getting too technical).I recommend this book to brand new programmers. Classic ASP programmers should pick up the MS Press book ASP.NET Programming with VB.NET, Step By Step."
3,topsy turvy,"The cover of this book reproduces a masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy -- upside down. I once wrote to the publisher asking why they didn't turn it right-side up, but they never responded. I wonder if they did that intentionally, or through ignorance. That would be like printing a page from the Book of Kells upside down."
5,Deja vu - Reflections today ot the 30's,This is an amazing book about human nature and the dictatorial vilanry of Stalin. What amazes me is the parallels with the Bush Administration in the immediate post 911 -with me or against me mentality. Stalin's paranoia reflected by the whole connerie of Donald Rumsfeld/Dick Cheney circus. Human nature does not change: only circumstances and names of events. God help us all.Today I read this as a Journalist from AL-JAZIRA testifies here in Geneva regarding his 6 year holyday in Cuba grace à la govenment de texas. Merde.
1,I agree with everyone else - BRING THE OLD MODEL BACK!,"What kind of moron with no children decided to discontinue a popular doll and replace it with an ugly interpretation that looks nothing like the original? Here's Madison Ave. again telling us what we should like, instead of LISTENING TO US. My daughter has a couple of the classic style, and I wanted to get her a couple more, but I'm not buying this garbage. I guess it's off to the auction sites...."
3,"Flashy, trashy?","This new doll is much different than the older version. We liked the old doll with its style and costumes based on the book. My daughters enjoy the art of the classic books, and thus were not keen on receiving this Madeline. This doll is more glamorous, which is missing the point of brave Madeline who was not a fashion plate. She does have a nice scar, but her long hair and glitzy face makes her look ostentatious and flashy. She is not the young Madeline who worried Miss Clavel. This doll wears a bit too much makeup - I guess that would worry Miss Clavel, too."
1,Classics stand the test of time...,"Please, please being back the original Madeline, friends, and accessories. My 4 yr. old daughter and all her friends LOVE playing with Madeline, love the books and videos and think the new dolls have ""weird looking big faces"". One of the little girls said that the new dolls look like ""aliens"" and she's upset because she wants Madeline's friends for Christmas but wants the dolls that look like the ones in the books and videos....the ""real ones"" not the ""weird looking ones"". Please let's try and maintain some integrity in this crazy world...the classic Madeline stories have been around for decades for a reason...they've stood the test of time...let's try and stick with what works!!!!"
4,Not a bad looking doll,"I really like this newer Madeline. I was never too fond of the older ""classic"" Madeline dolls, and therefore never bought them. However, with this newer Madeline out I will buy a set for my own personal collection and a set for my God Daughter. I love the clothes! All in all this doll is just fine. No, she is not the orginal Madeline, but that doesn't mean she is an ""ugly"" doll. I agree with another reviwer who simply states, ""If you don't like the doll, don't buy it."" It really is that simple. Although, I hope people remember that this doll does have her own unique look and shouldn't be compared to the older dolls. Just like you can't compare the newer Strawberry Shortcake to the original Strawberry Shortcake. Same things applies here. The new Madeline is a very pretty doll with own attributes."
2,Clueless Maddy?,"Like, what happened to the old Madeline? She was, like, totally cool, I mean, like, for sure, you know? This new ""Maddy"" lives in Beverly Hills and wants to say ""We love our bread, we love our butter but most of all we love to go shopping!"""
1,How Sad!,"How sad that the makers of the Madeline line couldn't recognize that madeline is a ""little"" girl - not a teenager. I'm disappointed but not surprised. The rush for children to grow up seems to never end."
1,Not a classic,"This ""new"" Madeline is horrible looking - not cute like the original. I showed it to my 4 year old who loves Madeline and she didn't like it at all - she said it didn't look like the Madeline in the books and videos. This new doll is a huge disappointment - I guess the toy company is trying to reach out to a different market of girls who like the Britany Spears look etc...The toy company should realize that if something is a hit the way it is, don't change it!"
1,Poor Madeline looks like a bimbo...,...and has anyone seen the new Pepito? Oh please! What is he wearing?! The reason Madeline colectors were Madeline colectors in the first place is because of her uniqueness. She didn't look like every other doll on the shelf. Give us back the REAL Madeline. I'm not buying this junk.
4,Cute!,"To read some of these reviews, you would think this doll came wearing hot pants with a pack of cigarettes. If you didn't like the way the doll looked, why buy it? The old ones are widely available. This Madeline is a welcome update and probably more attractive to the older girls in the Madeline target audience - five and six year olds whose tastes are bit more sophisticated. All of the Madeline dolls used to look more or less the same, with different hair. The new dolls give each character some individuality and look more like real little girls."
1,"If it is not broke, don't fix it!!!!","My daughter and I were so disappointed with the ""new look"" of Madeline. She is a big fan of Madeline and she wanted to know if we could return it for an ""old one."" The new one doesn't have that sweet quality of the original madeline. I hope Toys R Us will continue to stock the original Madeline. Remember the ""new Coke"". Classic Coke and Classic Madeline are here to stay."
5,Much better,"Madeline has always been a favorite book in our house, but my kids (I have 3 between ages 4 and 10) have never been interested in the rather plain looking 8"" dolls. In my opinion the new dolls don't look anything like the character in the book BUT neither do the old dolls (the 15"" cloth versions are beautiful, but I imagine it's very hard to make a plastic doll version). At least the new dolls look attractive, and my 4 yr old MUCH prefers the new look especially with the competition that's out there, -- Bratz dolls are also on the Xmas list, but apparently don't rank as high as the new Madeline in my 4 yr old's eyes (at least not yet). The doll has also spurned new interest in the Madeline books, and I would recommend it to anyone whose child/grandchild enjoys Madeline."
5,I wish to have so much fun with every book I purchase!,"As popular as the ""Blair witch project"" is for the movies, ""Bad Words Dictionary"" is for the world of letters. Four thumbs up Sir Voy Sobon (the prince of great ideas and obscenity)GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!"
5,"If you read only one book in your life, read this one","What more can I say. His words cuts through your darkness revealing Him in all glory. He is an inspiration a guide for everyone of all ages, sex, caste, creed or religion."
3,Giving Inspiration to the Disabled,"The ""Joy of Sex"" for the disabled is as good of a summary that anyone can write. And that sums up both the good and the bad of this work. The best feature, and the element for which I am personally grateful, is that the book states unquivically that the handicapped are sexual beings, just like anyone else. For that, all of us who are disabled, give a heart-felt ""thank you!"" When we moved from the general to the specific the book was less strong. I look forward to a time when the authors can assemble a more condition-specific work that has a bit more of the ""how to do it"" as well as ""why do it."" This book is sensitive and well written, and I praise it as a good start. But I also hope it is only a start as well, for it left me wanting more."
3,Atlantis gate,"This whole series would have been great if he had kept it to three books. It is to drawn out and he writes the same story, different places, in books three and four and part of two.I wonder if his other series are like this. I would like to know. Thanks"
3,"Good writing, Bad proofing.","Typos and incorrect character references, sometimes even from wrong plot lines, really tripped up the fluidity of the read. Good story though."
3,Proofreading? We don't need no stinking proofreading!,"I love Doherty/Mayer's books, and this one is no different.But the proofreading effort was horrendous. On the first title in this series, I didn't count the mistakes I caught, but this one I figured I'd see what I came up with. I counted no less than 81 mistakes! Unbelievable.Whoever they're paying to proofread this series, they're paying them too much. It looks as if they fed the printed novel through an OCR program, and went with whatever the computer spit out."
1,Spelling errors on every page,"This ebook is riddled with spelling errors, which makes it unpleasant to read. ""Who Dares Win Publishing"" certainly does not define excellence by offering an unedited product to the general public."
2,Did anyone proof-read this??,"Have only recently started reading this book, having enjoyed the first 2 in the series. I am, however, amazed at the number of typos, spelling errors and gramatical mistakes in this book so far... examples...""It had long been said that as long as the emperor provided brad and games, he would stay in power.""""If she was one who delivered false good news. He would have her head on a stake on the walls of the palace"".""I think it uses fault lines not just afro attacking us but to draw power.""Dont know whether I just got a bad Kindle download, but it is very frustrating as the storyline is quite good.."
1,Let's research the facts,"I could not go past page 27. When the author wrote that the output of the Chernoble nuclear power plant was milliwatts and that Mt. St. Helens was in Oregon I could not continue. If an author is writting fiction that's great, but if he includes something that actually happens as part of the story he should at least get the bare facts straight."
4,Spelling errors,"Get over the spelling errors and enjoy the series......who would take the time to COUNT them..... So many books, so little time....if ya mind won't just slide over them and press on then there's a problem......hang the editor is a bit harsh...yes, itcould be better editing but for $2.99????? Come on guys.......gee, wonder how many editorial errors I just made?"
4,Bruce Campbell is cool as ash in Evil dead.,"Evil Dead is a tale about five friends who travel to a desolate cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun.After uncovering an unearthly book with unGodly incantations,they unleash the cursed wood demons,who one by one possess all the friends.Before long,the only one left is Ash,played by Bruce Campbell.If youl ove survival films,you'll love this one!"
5,YOU NEED TO BUY THIS MOVIE,"This movie rocks, I love it. I think it is the one of the best horror movies ever. None of my friends have seen it, only one has and that is because I told him, and he thinks it is scary also. And not much scares us. I'm telling you, WATCH EVIL DEAD!!!!!!!!"
4,A creative piece,"Sam Raimi would be an interesting man to meet knowing he made this film. The movie was a low budget one, but had characteristics that no other high budget usually will have. That would be the creativity. Many films these day rely on special effects rather than creativity. Bruce Campbell plays his role excellently. He is much an underappreciated actor. I love the scenes where there is something chasing the characters, but you do not see exactly what it is. Also, the tree violating a girl's unmentionables, only Sam Raimi could think of something so so...I can't think of the word to say. GRADE: B+"
4,Really great,"""The Evil Dead"" is one of my favourite horror movies and certainly one of the most important horror flicks ever made. It's a pity that, in Germany, you only can get the ""cut"" version (with less gore than the original, of course). But what the heck, it's still a spine-chilling experience to watch Raimi's masterpiece. The movie itself is far better than most people believe, it does certainly not rely merely on cheap shock effects, but what you can find is also a great deal of references to other movies - especially old Hammer pictures from the 60's (e.g. the sinister surroundings, the fog hovering everywhere). Of course you shouldn't watch it if you already can't sleep after watching ""Gremlins"", but if you love real good horror films, you must get yourself into ""Evil Dead"". Suspense, fun and gore galore guaranteed."
4,the start of something great and unique,"Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead""(1979) was the start of one of the most original and great horror series in the genre. Even if you are not a horror fan and like movies that are highly creative, stylish, witty, and have the feel of a cult classic like say Quentin Tarantino's films then you should check out the series. The other two ""Evil Dead 2""(which is practicaly a remake of this film) and ""Army Of Darkness"" were satires but ""The Evil Dead"" was intended to be a serious horror film. It is hard to take it serious after seeing the other two first but it is well worth seeing and can be appreciated for the amazing cinematography and camera work on such a low budget film. You can see in ""The Evil Dead"" what was coming in the next two films and while it is worth watching, it is nowhere as brilliant as the next two. I recommend you see ""The Evil Dead"" last."
5,Evil Deadites everywhere!,"Evil Dead is probably the most grusome of the Evil Dead Trilogy, which consists of Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness. You will enjoy Evil Dead if you like seeing people get eyes gouged out, stabed with pencils, hacked to pieces, and rotting corpses exploding. I definantly enjoyed this modern masterpiece, and director Sam Raimi, though on a tight budget, still manages quite good special effects (i've seen movies made after this on a bigger budget that have worse special effects). Get this movie if you enjoyed George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Awsome. Five stars"
5,A good movie if you are in the mood to slaughter your buds,"I have seen this movie maybe a billion times! Let me tell you, these new horror movies such as Scream etc.. do not compare to this hack 'em uop gore fest! The plot is basically simple a guy goes with his buddies into the wods, they turn into demons, he cuts them up into little pieces. This has to be the best horror movie ever made, mainly because it is so cheesy. That is the way horror movie pioneers had it in mind. END"
5,"Good movie, Bad quality","Quality: I had no problem with the frame of the movie but the imagery was not the best. It was kind of fuzzy.-2 starsMovie: The movie is very good and has a creepy feeling to it. If you can't stand blood and guts then don't bother renting. The movie is so gory its rated NC-17. There are many suspensful ""jumpy"" parts. Its an 80's movie made by a group of college students so don't expect any special computerized effects. Instead there is clay animation-kind of cheesy. The blood is also sloppily thrown in. The movie gets 5 stars."
5,The Deadites Rule!!!!,The Evil Dead follows the story of 5 Collage students who go to a secluded cabin in the mountians. Once they get there strange things start to happen which leads to non-stop terror. Anyone who likes the horror genre will love this movie. Its filled with enough blood and gore to satisfy everyone's needs. I strongly recommend this movie. I even own it.
4,"Entertaining funny, but story wise not very good","For much of the gorey and bloody scenes, it was very entertaining, and for the most part humorous. Though this movie's story plot isn't that great, I think you could ignore it and still enjoy it. The one thing that really stumps me is that the dead can be re-animated by playing a tape, that really bothers me. Besides that almost everything is pretty good, although the character Ash is almost always covered in blood or a bunch of blood is being splattered on him, and in some ways they overdid it a bit too much.I would recommend that people watch this movie, highly entertaining, gorey, and humorous, which is oddly enough a great combination. I will say that that was one horny tree, and if you would be interested in what that means, go watch the movie!!!"
5,"Twisted, crazy, gory delight!","When I first heard of Evil Dead, it wasn't in some upscale, fancy movie mag, like EW or Rolling stone. I heard about it from fans of the other horror films I liked; Night of the living dead, texas chainsaw massacre, etc. They said it was one of the few films which was made up of every element that stuck out in these other pictures and still stood tall to the original source material. In terms of entertainment, the film is a 10+. In terms of filmaking, its a little lower. the film was Raimi's first attempt at a motion picture, and he didn't have a lot to work with. The make up is masterfully implemented by the other worldly camera, a charecter in its own. If you care even slightly about horror, see this and the 2 sequels."
3,Evil Dead: Gore-Iffic!,"Evil Dead is a movie I don't appreciate, Is pointless and no plot, just gore and of course Young dumb people staying in the woods, Why would you stay in a creepy cabin? Mama didn't raise no fool, But that's horror movies, people doing dumb stuff. Although Bruce Campbell is a legend.don't watch if your queasy."
3,Why is this being released again?,This could be good except there's no mention as to new material. I love this movie as much as any Bruce fan but why is this being released AGAIN? Does anyone know the difference between this and the previous releases?
3,Not feelin it,I read the reviews and i like zombie movies so i bought this one there were a few great gore scenes and alot of blood but i didnt really like it you cant say its scary its hilarous but thats about it
1,DO not watch,Very cult miovie. I personally do not like such cult sort of movie. I felt very uncomfortable on many scene and could not complete this. Avoid.
2,A Ride on the Overkill Express,"This movie was really just a gross-out flick. There wasn't a lot of real substance or decent, feasible plot. Cheesy. If you like movies that resort to over-the-top, senseless gore, this will be right up your alley. If you like camping horror movies, you'd be better off with something like Sleepaway Camp."
1,The dumbest movie in the world!,"This movie [was] so horribly bad, I don't see how anyone could like this movie, and the second one didn't even relate to the first one. The graphics [were] so bad, it wouldn't even scare a little kid, it would probably make him laugh. My advice don't rent this movie or buy it, but if you like horrible actors and really bad graphics then go for it, but you'll regret watching it, trust me. P.S. don't watch the second one either."
1,Dear God This is Just Bad,"After the largest mislabeling scandal in video history this movie remains the worst thing to hit Hollywood since the plot for Halloween 3. I deeply feel sorry for the people thinking they were buying Ben Hur (an actually good movie) and due to the scandal ended up with this [junk]. Is it any wonder Bruce Campbell's career has hit virtual rock bottom. Just watch this low budget [stink]fest. A bunch of poorly animated monsters attack some people in a cabin. At first the gore and killing of the monsters is pretty crazy and entertaining but it soons becomes stale and repetitive after 82 minutes of the same wackiness. Calling this a ""cult classic"" is unbelievable since there really is nothing classic about it."
3,The Evil Dead,"I watched The Evil Dead because I have heard so much about it over the course of my life, so I figured I have to watch it sometime. I can't believe this movie got a 100% here. I'm sure it was meant to be cheesy, but it was really neither funny, nor scary, but as a very low budget movie, it was decent. It was however, the bloodiest, goriest, grossest movie I have seen. EVER. But the special effects are so stupid looking, it doesn't really even gross you out or make you gasp or anything... just kinda looks funny."
4,Fantastic Flick ... but only a warmup of what's to come.,"This movie is incredible ... it is an incredible study on how to make a great movie on a shoestring budget. The sound explosion in the new dts version is unbelievable. However, pass on this one, and get the BOOK OF THE DEAD version -- best packaging ever"
5,An Enjoyable Gore - Fest!!,"I saw Evil Dead when I was 12 years old, and it nearly scared me to death. Now I see it as part comedy, part public service announcement not to read that blasphemous book the Necr...oops! The demons of Sarnath, no Kadar wouldn't like you watching Evil Dead without playing Call of the Cthulu or at least watching some troma flicks. If your in to Lovecraft, get this film!"
5,it wuz a trip!!!!!!,"i remember when i first saw this movie i was traumatized 4 life. i was only 2 or 3 years old and still could` nt take my eyes of the screen. i eventually saw the film several years later, and reminised. i dont remember seing part 2, but the evil dead in surround sound kix ass."
3,Great Premise - Horrible acting.,"When the unseen monster crashes into a bedroom and attacks a girl, the other characters, in the living room, glance up and STROLL to the bedroom to see what happened. After having been attacked several times by undead monsters they split up to go to separate bedrooms to get some sleep - and even though they have fairly strong storm shutters on the windows, no one thinks to close and lock them so monsters come crashing through all the time.The bonus extras on the DVD are decent. There's running commentary, stills, and raw footage of some of the shoots. The 5.1 Dolby remix improves the audio.No horror film collection is complete w/o the Evil Dead Trilogy. Though individually weak as a set they embody the spirit (pun intended) of 70's horror movie making."
4,Awsome,The Evil Dead is a great film for any horror fans. This movie delivers the Gore and the Comedy. This movie has alot of mistakes in it but only because it was a super low budget film. This film brings every horror fans dreams come true. It takes you on a crazy ride that is very fun and entertaining. All hail Sam Raimi for creating this film.His idea was fresh and delivered something that people had never seen before. What is even better than this is its sequels. Its well worth your money.
2,THIS MOVIE BARELY DESERVES 2 STARS,"I thought this movie was a big waste of video. First of all, the jacket for the movie was scarier and better than the movie. The picture you see on the cover (jacket) has nothing to do with the movie I was so disapointed. It leads you to believe one thing and the movie is something else.Both Evil Dead 1 and 2 I thought was not well done at all. They should have raised more money for the budget instead of raising the dead.. Please don't make a third.."
1,Anchor Bay low on funds = new evil dead dvd,"It must be that time of year again... Christmas, you ask? Nooooo! a new evil dead dvd, of course!I'm guessing with the adoption of hi-def dvd's they feel the need to milk the DVD format one last time (a final hurrah, if you will) before the onslaught of hd releases cometh.PS, I love this movie and give the film a solid 4 stars, but these dvd releases are not more than a joke at this point. After the last behemoth edition, what new could be added?"
2,say cheese,"Kinda lame. Yes, it was a fun horror flick for its time, but simply does not hold up these days. Lame is the word that comes to mind.What can you do?Hey, it made enough bucks over the years."
1,"Evil Dead, revisionist hype and the abuse of superlatives","This is, without any doubt, one of the worst films ever made. I'm not a film snob or punk trying to antagonize the deluded legion of dupes who idolize this piece of garbage. I'm just trying to provide balance to the roars of approval for this not-at-all-good ""film."" Seriously people, have you even watched this stupid thing? It is AWFUL (and not even in an ""Ed Wood meets Dead Alive meets tongue-in-cheek"" way)! There is, and I want this to be crystal clear, NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE! NOTHING...ZERO...ZILCH!!! Save your stars (seriously, FIVE stars for this crap - ARE YOU INSANE?!) for a movie that delivers...anything. Can we please relegate Sam Raimi and this ""train wreck"" to the pile of hyped up hacks and ""cult faves"" where they belong?!"
1,A film for sadists,"This was the word ""Psycho"" author Robert Bloch used for those who would watch this type of film. Having seen people's reaction to this movie, I have to agree.This is a sick film, designed to be such... to gross-out and create fear... not humor. The problem with the movie is that it appears to have been made sadistically. Rather than just show gore, the camera focuses on the violence longer than needed, as if this was pornography---indeed, this appears to be a motion picture for those who wish to be stimulated not by sex, but by suffering.There seems to be two types of reaction to the film--disgust and fear (normal people); humor and pleasure (people with a blood lust).The film received an ""X"" rating but withdrew this. Later, in 1994, the MPAA awared it an ""NC-17"". It well earns this rating. A film enjoyed by psychopathic minds."
1,"Weak, Uninteresting, Lame, Pathetic Excuse for a movie","I had always told myself that I would never watch Evil Dead after seeing the trailer back when I was a kid. The movie looked weak even way back then. Well, My cousin decided to play the movie tonight at his house, and boy oh boy, I wish I had back that time of my life. The movie is comedic to the point, where it makes it stupid. The guy gets covered in blood in one scene, and in that same scene his face is magically clean again. Then in part 2 he connects a chainsaw to the wrist of where he cut his hand off. It is just retarded, and lame! I seriously don't see how this movie gets such good reviews. I think it sucked"
1,terrible movie,"...The movie was boring..... It was so phoney looking it wasn'teven halfway convincing.If anybody out there is thinking of buyingthis movie please save your money,if not then don't say I didn't tell you so."
4,"""The Evil Dead' is the bloodiest horror movie I have seen","If you place this movie in your VCR, press stop at almost anyplace, and you'll see, blood, Cut wounds, stabbings, amputations or possessies."
5,Campbell packs this movie with lots of gore and humor.,"This is unlike any horror movie around. Action-packed, gore filled, and humorous in one! It keeps you watching, and keeps you wondering what will happen next."
5,"A must for cult\B horror movie buffs, frightingly funny.","The original in a set of three devilisly clever movies about the spirits of the dead and the famed book of the dead,The Necrinomicon. Sam Raimi is a master of what he does and if I could give this any more than 5 stars I would."
5,be groovy......buy it,"Folks,this is the grooviest DVD out there. I really liked the movie on video but the DVD blew me away. Picture and sound are as good as it gets and the extra features are awesome. Bruce Campbell's audio commentary is very funny. With this DVD, you can't get tired of warching it over and over again. Buy it and scream!"
5,Some pople visits an old cottage and then it all turns evil,"Excellent movie. Evil dead is the best movie i ever have seen. Lot`s of gore and good actor`s. Bruce Campbell does and brilliant job as an actor. Probably the best i ever have seen. Thank you Sam Raimi, for and incredible good movie. I recommend everybody to see the film. All of my friends loved it too, when i showed it to them."
5,One of my favorite films ever.,"Love this film. Lots of blood,guts and violence. Loved the setting,storyline and atmosphere and background music. This used to scare the mess out of me as a kid and still gives me nightmares even now when I watch it. I still have bad dreams about the evil spirit in the forest. Don't listen to people The only thing I would complain about is that some of the effects don't hold up that well,but this picture is over twenty years old so we can over looks that.Buy this and make sure you get the remastered version"
4,Worth Every Penny,Totally worth it. Who can argue with this price considering the quality of this film and the legends it built? I definitely reccommend the blu-ray version
5,Updated info on what is included on the discs!,"Just in from Anchor Bay are the final specs for their brand-spankin'-new special edition of Sam Raimi's cult classic The Evil Dead. Not one but two versions will be released on 3/5.

1,5 stars for the movie; 0 for the Anchor Bay DVD.,"I have something to warn all purchasers of ""The Evil Dead: Book Of The Dead"" DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment:THIS MOVIE WAS SHOT IN THE RATIO OF 1.33:1, WHICH IS FULL-FRAME TO FIT YOUR SCREEN. ANCHOR BAY SLAPPED 1.85:1 RATIO BARS OVER (I repeat, OVER) THE FULL-FRAME FILM!! IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, WATCH THE ELITE ENTERTAINMENT DVD VERSION OF EVIL DEAD. YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW BIG TIME COMPANIES WILL FOOL THE PUBLIC BY PRESENTING FULL-FRAME FILMS IN ""WIDESCREEN"" COVERING UP THE PICTURE!!BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,THE OATMEAL!!!!,"this movie is amazing and i know im only 13 but i absolutly loved this movie! wats cooler then zombies stabbing sharpened pencils into peoples ankle, and wats cooler then zombies dieing and there blood turning into this red oatmealy sort of stuff, and wats cooler then a book made of a persons face being burned!!! i loved it you will love it and if you dont go out and buy this movie everyone who has seen this movie will love making fun of you for not seeing it when you got the chance!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Horror classic!,"If there is a list for the most scariest movie ever, this one is on my list. This movie is very old, low budget, cult status looking, which makes the movie work. The cast makes the whole movie work also, especially Bruce Cambell, star of all the Evil Dead series. Probably the most recognizable part of the Evil Dead series is the first person perspective of the demon chasing after someone or running towards the house, very cool looking.The movie is about a group of friends going out to a cabin in the woods to have fun, but they do not know about the evil living there. As day turn to night, one of the girls get possessed and turns into a demon, the rest of the group have to stay together and fight the evil. Death by dawn, death by dawn.Overall, a classic horror movie, not the most special in effects or acting, yet delivers a shocking and weird taste of Sam Raimi."
5,EVIL DEAD: THE ULTIMATE EXPIERIENCE IN GRUELING TERROR!,"In 1981 on a vacation, 5 friends rent a small cabin in the Tennessee woods for a weekend of fun! Ash and Scotty explore the cellar where they find an old shotgun, a tape recorder, an ancient looking scepter, and ""Necronomicon Ex Mortus"", roughly translated, ""Book Of The Dead""! They listen to the tape which is the voice of Professor Raymond Knowby translating the words from the book. Unwittingly, the sound of his voice awakens an evil force in the woods which turns each one of them into demons, one by one until one remains.... His name's Ash...... from S-mart's housewares! Can he survive the possesed corpses of his friends and destroy this force known as the Evil Dead? Buy the movie and find out! Be sure to see the sequels: ""Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn"" and ""Army Of Darkness: The Medievil Dead"""
4,ok movie could be better,it was an ok movie except some parts aka ash surronded by zombies and the cliff hanger ending. other then that it was an ok movie because it was hardly scary 4 stars at best
5,"Okay - I know ""Another DVD release???""","I know what people are thinking - ""another DVD of this movie?"" and if you already own a copy there really isn't a whole lot to recommend it beyond the creepy skin covered book that the DVD comes packaged in. If, however, you haven't purchased a copy of this film, this is the version you should put your money on. The DVD includes some interesting documentary features and really cool extras - while the book of the dead has some nice illustrations that are pretty creepy. If you haven't seen the film - what are you waiting for. You really need to read more reviews to be sure? Buy this movie already!"
5,"oh no, sonny, they don't make em like this no more","Hands down the greastest low budget gore film ever! The film has a huge reputation and lives up to it every bit. And this book of the dead DVD is the ultimate collector's must have! Don't think so? Well, middle finger to you. You're missing out. (geez, its a joke!) Honestly, though. Make an effort. What do you have to loose, besides a hour and half? Better spent on this than the dreck we know as Hollywood."
