3,"Not the best I've read this year, but enjoyable nonetheless.",You can say one thing about Anne Rice--she's true to her erotica beginnings. This book exudes lust and sensual indulgence. The sexual undertones don't distract from the story though. It was a good read for a couple of nights.
2,Not up to Rice's usual standards,"I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I thought that her Vampire Chronicles were brilliant, even the controversial Memnoch. Her Mayfair series was extremely enjoyable. Sad to say I had to struggle through this book, which is absolutely unheard of with an Anne Rice Novel. Glad to see she is back to her old self with Pandora and Armand."
4,Exciting story!,"This is my first Anne Rice novel. I truly enjoyed it. Although the beginning was slow, I was intrigued with Azriel's story after he was made into the Servant.I would have liked to have seen more development of Esther, Rachel and Nathan. What struck a chord with me was the realism of the Minders cult, especially in light of current cult activities prevalent today.Servant of the Bones is a story of evil tempered with redemption."
1,"OH, ANNE.......",Hideously boring and superficial....Ms. Rice has disappointed me with her last few books. This has been the most depressingly bad so far
5,Best Rice ... Period!!!,"While I'm not a fan of Rice's vampire books .. (any of them) this book for me was a complete departure for her.... THIS IS A GREAT BOOK for anyone with imagination who likes fiction ... the wonderful story of Azriel, a spirit (deamon maybe) who was created in the most horrible manner during the age of Egyptian world dominance by the ancient egyptian preiests (?magicians or wizards ... whatever they were) and has wandered through the ages from one owner (controller) to another until the time of this story...This book shows true imagination and artistic story telling by Rice, which frankly I didn't think she had ..... PLEASANT SURPRISE for me ... I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a truly entertaining and captivating fiction story ... I'll definitely check out more Rice books (not about vampires) from this Author. OH, BTW.... I DO NOT recommend her new book ""Christ the Lord Out of Egypt"" either.... but I still really like this book."
2,Not my favorite Rice novel...,"Probably my second least favorite novel by Rice (second only to Memnoch the Devil). I found it boring, slow, and too complicated. It was difficult to follow and the character's motivations for doing anything were unclear. Otherwise, I'm a huge Anne Rice fan."
1,A cure for insomnia,My review title states it all. I fell asleep and never finished it! It got too boring. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Anne Rice. And I'm a fan of her vampire chronicles. I love how flowery her writing style is and her character description of character depth and scenes is amazing to me. But the first 3 chapters in this book was so boring I could not go on. It seems that the chapters could do nothing better than ramble and ramble and ramble. It was quite repetitive of Interview of a Vampire. I felt almost cheated in the since that the story idea was good but the story developed like an Interview with the Vampire repeat!
4,Strange...then again..strange,"I had become tired of reading romance novels, and had picked this book up. I had never read Anne Rice before, so this was definately new. I had a really hard time getting into the beginning of the book, mainly because I had no idea what was going on. I kept reading though, and ended up liking the book. Its very strange. I also found that it is very hard to explain to someone what the book is about. I would give it it try, if I were you. Not too bad at all."
5,A great tale.,"I enjoyed this book. It probably is my favorite Rice book. Apparently others thought it was very poorly written, but I have to disagree-- it kept my interest from start to finish. Well worth your time to read this book if you like Anne Rice's work you won't be disappointed."
1,Painfully boring!,"The first Anne Rice book I ever read was 'The Vampire Lestat' and i loved it so much that I decided to read all the books in the Vampire Chronicles. When I bought 'The Servant Of The Bones', it was at a book signing and I even got Anne Rice herself to sign it. Little did I know that Servant would turn out to be absolutely the worst book I have ever read. It took me almost 2 years to read!! The book was filled with names that were just as easily pronounced as the ingredients on a package of gum. The plot just does not seem to go anywhere, but rather drags on and on to point of tears. Overall, this must be one of Rice's worst books, however, the great books from her earlier years makes up for it."
4,Typical Anne Rice,"In this book, Anne Rice continues with her vulnerable male character-types, and creates Azriel, whom you can't help but love. Somehow, this book seems darker than the Vampire Chronicles, and somehow more despair-ridden. Of course, I loved it!"
2,Definitely not one of Anne Rice's best works.,"Anne Rice should stick to vampires. This book was very weak in characterization, except for Azriel, and the plot was ludicrous. It appears to me that the author keeps trying to make each book she writes more unbelievable and gruesome than the next. I have not cared for any of her books after the Vampire Chronicles and The Mummy. The Mayfair witches series deteriorated rapidly. Please Anne, this book is not worthy of a sequel. Where is the sequel to The Mummy, a much more interesting and enjoyable novel?"
2,Could not get into it.,"This was my first Anne Rice book, and my last. The book was hard to follow and actually somewhat boring. I was half through the book before stumbling upon the plot. Character developement was as weak as the plot."
4,Chris's magic,"Delightful and intoxicating as a dry martini! Mr.Lindsay's writing belies his sweet, reserved and quiet nature. Below this outward appearance there just has to be lurking a vibrant and bewitched other, projecting itself into his richly imaginative fiction and enjoying the hell out of doing it!The deep and satisfying chuckle generated by the oh-so-dry humour erupts now and then into full and appreciative laughter at Mr. Lindsay's command of satire. Do yourself a favour. Read it."
5,It's a must have book,The book is excellent.All chess players must have it.The notation used can be learned and it's fun too.The book is Cheap and Short plus can you improve a lot.
1,Descriptive notation beware!,The bugger is in DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION. Who could be bothered to labour through that when I could just use ALGEBRAIC. What a sickner!
4,not for people below < 1600,"I have 1400 rating and I found this book to be notso useful. It may be me, because I am not that good yet.But, at least, it can said that this book is not organizedin a manner that helps learning. I am giving it 4* becauseI could not totally wrong, because of level."
4,A must have for progress in Chess,"What I did not like in this book is the poor quality of the diagrams.The analysis and explanations are great.It's clearly a valuable book especially in parallel with Kotov's ""Think like a Grandmaster"".As the title indicates, it's about the middle game. So, bear in mind it does not cover all the stages in a chess game.Was one of the books that made me a professional, and now I came back to it to refresh my skills after a long interruption."
2,Not as good as they say,I ran the games in this book through Fritz and they are ripe with bad moves. There is little explanation given. Most of the information is suppose to be understood already. This isn't a good book for newcomers. I'm not new to chess and I have learned more from other books than from this one. I'm not here to tell you what books to get but there are better ones out there.
5,Exceptional!,"Jonathan Demme knows how to choose music for his movies. The soundtrack of his latest flick (a wonderful film in itself) is exciting, a melange of the best of world music. However, I wish it included ""Charade d'amour"", the sultry tango song sung by Anna Karina, the First Lady of the French New Wave. She is represented by her 60's hit ""Sous le soleil exactement"" in this album."
4,Attention all music buffs,What is the name of the song that Mark Whalburg is singing in this movie?Thanks in advanceY
3,Songs that are NEVER on the soundtrack,"Ok am I the only person who listens to the music playing on the main menu page? The track that plays on the main menu page is a techno/dance blast -- yet, through 1 full year of searching, no one can tell me who the artist is! [...]"
5,One of the Best Indie Films in Years!,"This film is a remarkable achievement for the writers, directors and fine cast. Besides being extremely well done, this film manages to deal with several topics with eloquence, including mental illness and transgendered lifestyles. All of the actors do an excellent job, particular Silas Howard and Harry Dodge. I would definitely recommend this film and hope to see more of this great talent in the future."
1,A Movie for the Septic Tank,"I bought this DVD because the back makes it sound like it is about two troubled kids who join together to find one's birth mother and along the way discover a higher understanding of themselves. When I finished watching it, I felt as if I'd fallen into my neighbor's septic tank. In short, the description of the movie is as much a lie as the characters themselves. Indeed, my wife thought they must have men playing women and women playing men. Whatever they were, this is one movie to add to the septic tank. The only reason I gave it an 'F+' is that it shows how seemy and degraded this side of life is and, hopefully, can be used as a bad example for traditonal values families to discuss.Do we need legislation for a ""Truth in DVD Descriptions"" Act?"
2,Ill Fit,"The item looks amazing, but the fit is rather poor. It was ordered for someone who is a size M, but without a shapely rear end, the item kind of sags."
4,"Great product, picture a little deceiving","It's a nice garter, but the picture is not very true. The side are like in the image and the front looks nice, but the back does not make this nice ""arch"", it look totally like a /\, if you know what I mean. It makes more a 45 angle and the ""closure"" is just a ajustable strap.Plus, I'm a tiny woman (my hips have 30 inches) and it fits me too large. So I used my sewing skills, took away the ajustable strap on the back, cutted some fabric and sewed a metal closure. Final result is absolutely great, but of course, if you have bigger hips, you won't have this problem!Anyway, for the price I paid, and the way it looks so sexy, it worth it. Oh, and it really works as a garter belt, it hold stockings very well."
1,I would not recommend this camera,"I purchased two of these cameras for a customer to use in remote locations. One camera set up fine - the other never worked correctly. The pan motor in the first camera burned out in less than three months. Both were returned to 4xem for repair. It took more than four months and several phone calls to get the cameras returned. Neither returned camera could be installed. One finally installed wirelessly after a firmware upgrade. 4xem said that the cameras only worked with D-Link routers. After finally getting a new camera, upgrading the firmware, the cameras will not stay connected and must constantly be rebooted by unplugging them. This is not a great option since they are installed in remote locations - it costs my customer about $200 in labor for each reset. They uninstalled the cameras today and chewed me out for recommending them."
3,4XEM PTZ Camera,"The hardware is excellent and is reliable and easy to set up. Good workmanship and very reliable. However, the software which comes with it, and the firmware installed in the camera, leave much to be desired. In fact, you will have better success and fewer headaches using external software, such as securityspy, to monitor and upload the video. The software included with the camera only works with some windows machines, regardless of whether you follow their instructions or not."
4,"Good pairing, good performances","The pairing of Scheherazade and the 1919 Firebird Suite make for a wonderful disk that's exciting to listen to all the way through.I don't really know Scheherazade all that well, but the Firebird is very well played. My only complaint was due to a hiss that became evident when the music dropped to quiet levels. I think I have noticed this on other DG recordings, but normally only when I am using headphones (I don't hear the hiss on everything I listen to, so I'm not sure whether it's DG's recordings or my headphones).All in all, this is a great disk, and one which I will listen to in its entirety many times!"
4,Very good for streching 30 min into 98,"This 98 minute film starts out on How Miss Brooks comes to a new city to teach at Madison High and introduces us to the characters that were featured on radio and television from 1948 and on, thus a good introduction to people unfamilar with the 30 minute radio/television comedy.It keeps the character traits and comedy of the radio/TV series and introduces a bit of drama that would not be out of touch with today. It shows Ms. Arden's underrated dramatic acting talents in this way.I doubt any updated modern film version the series would be just as goodIf one had never seen the TV/Radio series and judges it as just a movie, it would be a very good family film, if the children were of the grade 5 to 13 age."
4,It's Dr Freudstein!,"I picked up this little gem for about 5 bucks from a local used DVD shop. I would recommend this to fans of older horror movies. True, the dubbing does suck and the acting is questionable, but the last 15 minutes of this movie almost make up for it. Dr. Freudstein is truly one of the most twisted and interesting villians I've yet seen in a horror movie and its easy to see Rob Zombie's inspiration for his Dr. Death character in House of 1000 Corpses. Not to mention, there's a few scenes near the end that push the gore envelope to the max! Love the maggot-stew gushing out of Freudsteins wounds... Truly twisted!! They don't make gore effects like this anymore, i hate CGI gore!!"
4,its about atmosphere and gore,"This film is excellent for atmosphere and gore. Creepy moments coupled with outlandish gore scenes that rival those in the Beyond. If unconventional b-horror films are your thing, then check out House By The Cemetery. Well worth the wait for the definitive, uncut version of this film, whcich was banned in many countries until this recent release."
2,Wack,"this movie is wack. i like zombie movies with people coming back from the dead and i just looked at the title and it said house by the cemetery so i figured thats what it was. So i rented it and watched it and found out that it was about a retard with a bag over his head locked in a basement trying to kill people. I've definitely seen worse tho, and the reason i probly thought it was so bad was because it wasn't what i had expected. Either way, i've never made an attempt to rent or recommend this movie to anyone else and i suggest you do the same. Im out"
1,Boring,"Why is it that Fulci fans are so die hard and fail to admit that the director didn't even make a decent horror film? After hearing so much about his films when i was a teen, and seeing all his gory make up on Fangoria magazines, i decided to finally rent some of his stuff. Was i ever disappointed, this film is ludicrous, mainly because it doesn't even resemble a horror film. Most of the time is wasted on back drop information that leads up to a banal climax."

1,One of the worst movies ever...,"I never understood the hype around Fulci. He's severely overrated. This movie is one of them. Slow, terribly acted, terrible directed, and just plain stupid. This is not a great movie, even from the 80's. Even beyond the ""cheesy"" classic. Definitely a movie worth forgetting. Watch Zombie 2 instead."
3,A clumsy monster...,"This film is one of Fulci¡s cruel films, which is crueler than his early films. It is brutal and has factors, which are hard goring. However, it cannot be explained. It happened that in a limited place which makes fear easily. It is a good creation of situation like this. It has many realistic brutal scenes but the plot is unreasonable and clumsy. It is not important in this film because this film just emphasizes a cruelty, which can stimulate curiosity to the audience. Before this film, there are good sound and visual effects, but this one is not better than previous works. Anyway, it is a good movie for people who like to watch the ruthless horror films."
2,Raspberry horror,"I was really disappointed with this clunker,the only thing in this film I was really impressed with was the acting ability of that little blond kid. Man for a boy can he scream! I'm writing this review from memory (this is one film I'd like to forget)The film is kind of confusing,you don't know what's happening one minute to the next. The storyline is kind of quirky. There's are a few good scenes one gory and stupid. The gory scene if when the babysitter loses her headThe stupid scene is when daddy (I think it's the father) gets attacked by a bat, it bites his hand and he does everything to get it off, When they finally find the mad doctor/scientist whatever he/it is, it comes his time to die (of course you can't kill something that has been dead along time) but when they stab him..yuck thats when I almost lost it.Don't buy this movie unless you are patient/tolerant of bad filmaking"
2,Quality leaves a bit to be desired.,"Well, it's GREAT value for the money, can't beat that. Still, the quality really is a little lacking; fuzzy picture, muted sound, and only 4 chapter-stops?!! Still, at this price it really is hard to complain. Anchor Bay are due to release a fully remastered version v.soon (if not out already); if yr a hardcore Fulci fan, you might want to wait."
1,lousy,"This movie sucks! It's very weird, and dubbed in english. It's about a family that movies into a house by a cemetery. In the basement there is this creepy, warped, leatherface kinda guy. They don't know that he lives in the basement, and strange things happen. It's just a waste of money, it's a little bloody, but not done tastefully. It's kind of hard to follow and all over the place...PASS on this one..."
1,House what a stinker,This thing has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I know that with these type of movies you kind of have to look the other way when it comes to plot or story line it even wasnt that gory. Considrering that Fulci made zombie which blows house away. This by far has to be his worst movie. Theres also a problem with the dvd my player is brand new and this dvd made my system spin very fast and make a buzzing noise but it did play the movie. Please dont bother to see this movie not ot even to rent.
2,Oh boy.,"Let's start by saying I am a huge fan of City of the Living Dead and the Beyond. So even thought I have never seen this movie, I bought it...mistake. This does not have a fraction of the atmosphere as the for mentioned films. And while I don't mind the thing we overlook in a Fulci movie (lack of concrete plot, bad acting, awful dubbing) where was the monster(s)? It's like watching a Godzilla movie where the monsters are only in the last five minutes of the film after watching an hour and a half of nonsense! And the DVD.... While the print is clean I have to say that Anchor Bay's job is a shadow of what they did on the films I mention above. The sound is 2.0! I was going to pre-order Anchor Bay's Demons/Demons 2, but after the job they did on this...no way."
1,I will save you 82 minutes of your life,"I purchased this film for 5.99 from my local HMV, the other day and have just finished sitting through this so-called film.There was no story line, just a poorly conceived concept the dubbing or voice sinc was atrocious. The actors especially the young boy was extremely annoying and the gore that normally would make a film like this, remotely watch able was non-existent.Characters just turned up with no explanation, people disappeared and no one seemed bothered, blood seem to just vanish from the floor, need I go on.....Anyway save yourself some time, stare at the wall for 82 minutes you will feel more satisfied!"
2,FULCI'S GREAT BUT THIS ISN'T THE BEST COPY TO BUY.,"After getting Pieces and this title I'm staying far away from Diamond DVD's all together. I'm a hard core gore fan, and the biggest fan of Fulci's work, but was dissapointed in this copy. You're better off finding a COMPLETELY uncut form of this movie from an inport service such as Midnight Video. Contrary to most beliefs this is not an uncut version. But hey it's on DVD, as for the price, you get what you pay for. P.S. Pieces is not totally uncut either."
2,Um.,"This movie is alright, but I wouldn't pay $17.98 for it. It's confusing and the acting is bad, which is somewhat on par for a Fulci film. Unforunately, there isn't enough gore to offset these factors.I got it in the Horror Rises from the Grave set w/ 3 other movies for $7.It's worth seeing, but the only really memorable scene is the ver first one."
5,SUBLIME,THIS IS THE MASTERPIEACE OF LUCIO FULCI EVERYTHING IS MARVELOUS IT IS BLOODY CREEPY SCARY AND DISTURBING AT ALL THE MUSIC IS FANTASTIC WE CAN SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN SO GOOD
4,"Amazingly Gory, but good fun!","After a fantastic start which has definite echos of 'The Shining', this film ups the gore content leaving you feel quite sick by the end. As ever, Fulci treats us to a multitude of strong gore scenes, inculding the most ridiculous bat attack ever filmed! Not as good as 'Zombie' but better than 'The Black Cat' or 'The Beyond' (which I don't particularly like), House has soem great performances, some cheesy, but hey, what where you expecting? If you are ven slightly interested in the 'golden era' of Fulci horror then you wil want to check this movie out, i doubt that you will be disappointed."
5,The bloodiest movie with the best music score.,"I am a big fan of the Lucio Fulci-movies. The house by the cemetery is one of the most bloody. It is about a family, Norman Boyle, Lucy Boyle and their little son Bobby. They are gonna move to New York, for Norman have to do researches for his job. They are gonna live in a house by a cemetery. Its live in by a crazy medical man, Dr.Freudstein for over 150 years, and he stays to be alive by human flesh and blood. He lives into the cellear under the house for over 150 years. At that moment, strange things happens and he tries to catch and murder the family by a violent way.The music of the film is great; it is been composed by Walter Rizatti and Alexander Bloncksteiner. It conserns the opening titletrack and the closing."
3,House by the Cemetary 'haunted' by the walking dead.,"A college professor agrees to complete the research project of a faculty member who went mad and killed his assitant. In an unwise move, he and his family take up residence at the same house that the insane prof lived and killed. Would you move into an old house with a tomb in the living room and where gruesome murders have happened? Didn't think so, but if the lead characters hadn't done so then there would be no movie.The couple's young son is plagued with visions of violence and befriended by the spectre (maybe, maybe not) of a kind young girl.And something seems to be living in the basement.Tight narrative was never Lucio Fulci's strong point, but he did use atmosphere and, in particular, sound effects to good effect. House by the Cemetary is not his best film (that would be The Beyond in my opine), but it is gruesome and creepy enough to fill the second half of a b-movie double bill."
4,House by the Cemetery DVD,"This is an excellent Fulci film with plenty of graphic deaths. The DVD from Diamond Entertainment is great, and for only 6 odd bucks, it's a steal. The picture quality is taken from the laserdisc and is fantastic, and best of all it's completely uncut & in widescreen. There are no extras, but what would you expcet?"
2,Slow research film with some good 'gore' scenes...,"Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the ""Frankenstein-like"" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's ""The Beyond"" ranks way 'beyond' this however."
3,That damn kid,"Damn was the kid annoying. The movie would've been much better had he been killed in the opening scene. My thoughts....if you like this kind of movie, you'll like this one. If not, you'll hate it."
2,Gory Horror Form the Italian Master,"House by the Cemetary. Lucio Fulci has been one of my favorite horror directors since I first watched the genre masterpiece. This film, in true Lcio fashion, offers up all the gore and all the horror as is expected from this great director. However, at times it moves rather slowly, and the gore is no where near sufficient for the die hard Lucio fan. Strong elements of the film however, include tense atmosphere and a sense of lurking danger. For the most part however, I would resommend the film Zombie for a true taste of Lucio's genius. I give this film two stars."
2,House By the Cemetary,"I would actually give this movie a 2 1/2 stars. Out of all the recent Italian Horror movies that my friend has bought recently, this is by far the best one yet. It does have the suspence that a good horror should have. The makeup isn't bad either. I would also say that parents need to review the movie for themselves, prior to letting their children watch it, as it is very grusome, and gory. The movie portrays a couple of movies and gave them thier start. One of those movies would be ""The Sixth Sense"". By the time the movie comes to an end, you are cheering for the little boy."
4,An Unexpected Hoot of a film,"I have been a fan of the badly-dubbed Italian Giallo flicks for quite awhile. I know almost every Dario Argento film by heart. I happened across a list of slasher films that I hadn't seen before and this one came up on my Netflix queue. This is actually my first Lucio Fulci film. It was a beautiful, restored version. I found it a lot of fun. While I can't be scared of a movie like this with terrible acting, bad dubbing and laughable effects, it was still a joy to watch. I laughed every time they said the little boy's name was Bob. And that bat attack scene had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt. Give it a try if you haven't seen it. You won't be let down. I can't wait to check out some of his other ones."
4,House by the Cemetary,"Wondering if this one is public domain since it's on a few other dvd box sets I have. This movie is fairly good. Lots of blood, gore, knives. I always laugh at the dubbing on these Italian films. It seems that the same voiceover actors were used to dub these 70's and 80's Italian horror films. If you like this genre, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It makes a nice addition to the collection."
2,FULCI'S GREAT BUT THIS ISN'T THE BEST COPY TO BUY.,"After getting Pieces and this title I'm staying far away from Diamond DVD's all together. I'm a hard core gore fan, and the biggest fan of Fulci's work, but was dissapointed in this copy. You're better off finding a COMPLETELY uncut form of this movie from an inport service such as Midnight Video. contrary to most beliefs this is not an uncut version. But hey it's on DVD, as for the price, you get what you pay for. P.S. Pieces is not totally uncut either."
3,what gore??,"just a quick jab at a movie i do like. i love fulci , i love gore, i even love odd plots, but this movie is mediocre in all columns.to say it is a great movie is insulting considering the offerings from the same director we've all grown to love."
3,GREAT MOVIE -- DISAPPOINTING TRANSFER,"This is not a review of the movie (because I LOVE this movie), but a review of the Bluray transfer. I was very disappointed. I understand that given the original film, there is a limit as to what can be improved, but in my opinion this Bluray offers nothing to merit purchasing it over the already fine DVD version which I already had. When I buy a Bluray I expect it to be worth the price of the update. The sound on this is no better than the DVD. The picture is barely better. It does not pop, nor did it even seem to be in full 1080p. It's buying these kinds of Blurays that make me really question the overall worth of this format. There are certain Blurays that ARE well worth the upgrade (Blade Runner for one), but sooooooooooooo many others seem like nothing more than a attempt to suck more dollars from loyal fans who, like me, are constantly trying to obtain the best possible movie experience. I can not readily recommend this product."
4,Jagger/dylan combo,"I like the music, but when lead singer Marschke isn't sounding like Mick Jagger, he sounds like Bob Dylan. It's not a disk I will listen to frequently (although it's got great hooks) because all the songs sound similar, and that gets boring after a while. Have to give the guys a point for being from my hometown, Detroit."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,Complete snooze. Both the music and vocals are completely lacking in any type of emotion and depth. This is a karaoke session disguised as an album. 100% bland and forgetable. Look elsewhere please.
5,Harry Connick and Brian Evans...the only two,"These guys are the real thing. I'm tired of listening to these other ""model types"" who get record deals and sound like junk. Harry Connick's latest album shows once again that when the real thing wants to, he shall command the masses. Harry Connick doesn't need a gimmick. He IS the gimmick. No one like him. I like Brian Evans as well, and was surprised to see Evans is # 2 on Amazon.com best selling jazz albums while Harry is at # 4, but what the heck...they are both terrific."
2,Where's the beef?,"I'm sorry this crooner just doesn't cut it for me. This performance was uninspiring to say the least! Where was the up-tempo excitement this style demands?Well thank goodness we have a solid group of ""Swinging Stylists"" to keep this wonderful music ALIVE. Here is a few of the more talented ones....Harry Conick, Michael Buble, Steve Tyrell, Jamie Cullum and the gifted Peter Cincotti. Oh and how can I forget the GREAT Bobby Caldwell!!"
2,Swingin With Style,"I am a real fan of this kind of music, and Monte's voice is good, however no matter how well he might have sung the songs, the songs he sang like ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", ""Mack The Knife"" ""Unforgettable"" to name a few of the great hits we all know and love just don't compare in any way to the original tunes. I feel he did himself a great disserice by singing the great oldies he did, and should have choosen other tunes instead. The orchestration arrangements also were not as good as the originals I am afraid to say. Michael Finestein, Harry Conick Jr. can pull off singing great tunes, and I think Monte could too, but not with this CD."
4,Worth the Purchase,"Monte Procopio sings in a way that does not convey real feeling and emotion. He has a pleasant tone quality, but lacks two things: (1) genuine emotion; and (2) proper singing technique. He sounds cliche. The band, however, is HOT!! Buy the CD for the band and the arrangements. I typically sing along (being an alto, he sings a perfect octave below me) to try to help him out a bit."
2,"Not Bad, But No Winner","I thought the new arrangements on these old favorites were pretty good. Mr. Procopio has a decent voice but at times he sounds a little ""stiff"" with the faster songs. I think they used too many songs associated with Frank Sinatra on this one. They do a good job but as I was listening to the album, I couldn't help thinking how much better the originals were."
3,"Pleasant - but nothing like Boz Scaggs, But Beautiful","From other reviews, I thought this would be a great album, with a really hot swing band. I found it to be okay - but it doesn't even begin to compare with Boz Scaggs (yes Boz Scaggs) album of jazz classics."
1,No D-rings = completely useless gig bag,"It's such a shame that SKB chose to discontinue the D-rings on the SKB-130 contoured trumpet case because they completely ruined a great product. It was one of the best cases out there for the money, a highly protective hard shell case with the convenience and style of a gig bag. Some idiot in upper management (who obviously never played a gig in his life) decided to save a few pennies and stop putting D-rings on the case, so now there is no way to attach a shoulder strap to carry your instrument. Whoever heard of a gig bag with no strap to carry it? SKB, if you're listening, please put the D-rings back on the contoured trumpet case!!!!!!!!"
4,"you're great, Karajan!","That's the finale of the seventh I was looking for.Save me from the Grave and Wise!!!Thanks a lot, dear Herbert."
4,Good product & service,Order was filled quickly and the CD was as good or better than I actually expected. Nice job. Paul.
2,YUK!,"These performances of the Fourth and Seventh symphonies from the BPO and Karajan recorded late in his life are better left on the shelf. What was Karajan thinking in this Seventh? It is way too fast for one thing and the playing of the BPO is a little slack. The performance of the Fourth fares better, but I still would opt for both of Karajan's other symphony cycles for either of these works. It is almost like he needed to play games with the score just so it would sound different than his other two Berlin cycles. Bad choice."
1,Great Songs-Awful Sound Quality,I think Mick Ralphs is a great songwriter and guitarist. His vocals are not his stong point but then neither are Keith Richards. You can get through the howling for the great licks and hooks. The songs here are a lot of fun and I really want to like this record but the sound quality and production are simply horrible. I hate to give Mick a bad report but it is hard to believe how terrible this is. It sounds like you are listening to the music through a tin can. Remix and re-release it Mick. You can do it!
3,Not The Originals- But Entertaining,"This 2006 issue from Fuel Records does not contain the original recordings- a fact that is not noted anywhere on the outside of the package. That said, these 1973 sides, cut in Nashville are entertaining nonetheless. Particularly strong are renditions of Willie Mabon's ""I Don't Know"", Fats Domino's ""Please Don't Leave Me"", and the bluesy ""Don't Deceive Me"". The sound throughout is impeccable- including the two live recordings which close the set. It's a nice disc- but not the one to buy if you're looking for Screamin' Jay's original recordings."
1,Hideous,"I've owned this recording for nearly 20 years, and am pleased to find that there are others out there with my reaction to it: Ghastly. Uninspired. Out-of-tune. Wrong.Do NOT buy this recording.This ruined Holst's ""The Planets"" for me for a VERY long time. A friend turned me onto the Grainger/ Philharmonia Orchestra recording and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!That's the one to get."
1,Not the best recording out there. Trust me.,"I shall make this review short and to the point. Of all the recordings of this work I have, Karajan's and Levine's probably tie as being my personal least favourites. Karajan's Jupiter begins with violins that are in desperate need of tuning -- you can almost count how many are being played and there's an annoyingly audible *squeak* in there too. Most of the music on this disk is sloppy and I strongly suggest anyone who is considering to buy it to look for another. If you want a *real* CD, there's always Dutoit's, any of Boult's, Simon's, or even Previn's. I've heard other recordings by Karajan, like the Rite of Spring (in which you can hear someone actually cough quite loudly), and I really don't see what the fuss is all about with him. He seems to me to be a rather mediocre conductor."
3,There are better recordings.,"When it comes down to it, Karajan and the Berlin PO made a good recording. There are particular points that I find myself really enjoying the interpretation. Part of me just can't get over the sloppiness, though. The snare drummer adds a hugely noticable eighth note in Mars, it sounds like a bassist or two comes in early in the same movement, and generally it feels like the orchestra isn't being nearly as precise as it could be. They really cut loose at a few places, but instead of it being extrodinary and powerful, it often just sounds careless. There are plenty of good recordings of The Planets (I'm particularly fond of CSO), and the bottom line is that many of them were done better than this."
4,Pretty good,"This is by no means a definitive performance of ""The Planets"", yet by no means is it worthy of one star. While the recording is somewhat low(I have to turn up the volume slightly when I listen to it), the playing is quite compitent. Are there better recordings out there? Almost certainly, but this is by no means a ""horrible"" rendition. Of greater concern to me is the 52 minute playing time--it would have been nice to have an additional selection to round out this disc."
1,PURE DRECK,"I remember when this recording came out and I went to a friend's house to listen to it. He loved DGG recordings and was excited about his new purchase. Not only is this possibly the worst recording of the Planets, but one of the worst recordings of anything ever. When the organ came in I finally burst out laughing. I told him to toss it in the trash and get the Steinberg/Boston Symphony recording also on DGG."
4,Omega Litter Mat,These are nicely made litter mats but are rather small. Would have preferred a bigger size to help keep litter off rug.
2,"cute looking, but not big enough and hard to clean","This mat is cute looking, but that's about it. My cat tracked litter onto it and then onto the carpet beyond, and I still always found myself vacuuming litter from her little area all the time. Also, if she ever misses the litter box and I have to clean this litter mat, the pee smell refuses to go away (even with bleach and vinegar!). I got the ""PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat"" a few weeks ago, and it's serving my needs far better than the Omega Paw version."
3,Not used much,"This would be great if my cat didn't side step it on the way out of her morning, mid-morning, noon, mid-noon, evening, mid-evening and twice nightly kitty litter routine. It must bother the pads of her feet so I gave it away."
2,Better than nothing . . .,If I had to do it over again I would try a different mat (something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic)Pros1. reduces tracking somewhat2. more attractive than other litter mats3. doesn't take up too much spaceCons1. my cat doesn't like it--most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet2. it's too small
3,Okay but not the greatest thing ever,The mat is functional but there is still a ton of kitty litter that gets on the floor. You could probably find a $5 mat at WalMart that would work just as well.
2,Good chance this won't perform as promised for the price.,"We love the Omega Paw litter boxes to death, but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box.Our cats don't like the paw cleaning side, they refused to walk on it. So we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter, but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor. We leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those, but our new boxes are doing fine without them. The cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves. You might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws, but don't buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it."
1,"Didn't work, not recommended","This is a cute-looking mat, shaped like a cat's paw with a little cartoon kitty in the middle. Well, my cats hate it. They won't step on it and instead jump over it, as it's not very big. So, it was no help at all in regards to litter scatter.Those plastic bumps on which the cats are supposed to wipe their feet are so hard, it must hurt their pads. Maybe this product would be better used as a ""scat mat"" to keep them off surfaces where they're not allowed."
2,hurts my feet!,"I thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly eye-sore. It also hurts to walk on with bare feet. Having wood floors, I hate sweeping 3-4 times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box, so I thought I'd give it a try. Helped some, but overall I'd say not worth the money."
2,Eh..,"I'm just not convinced these things work at all, and this one doesn't increase my optimism. My cats still track litter well beyond the box. I agree with another reviewer, I don't think cats like stepping on this hard plastic mat. I don't like stepping on it, so why would they with their tiny feet?! I bought it because it was a good size and reasonable price - not so reasonable if it doesn't work. I wish I could find a foam one on Amazon to see if it does better. The bathroom rug captures more litter than this. Not recommended."
3,GO FOR THE LARGER MAT!,"The mat is really too small to be very effective. Unless you have a VERY NEAT CAT, you will wish you had a larger mat.Frankly, I was saving a few bucks and it was not worth it. Now I will have to purchase another mat if I want to keep the litter off the floor."
4,"A bit small, but functional","I purchased this mat to go with the omega paw roll away cat litter pan. I love the color and look of this cat mat. It is easier to clean than the cloth type you see in most pet stores. It is a bit small, so litter still tracks with this mat. It is still, however, the best mat I've ever purchased for my cats, and they have had at least a dozen. Even after two or three years of use this mat still looks relatively new. It's easy to clean as well. I wash it in conjunction with the litter pan. I just soak it inside the litter pan with warm soapy water. It does take some time to dry though. I am deducting one star for it's size. It does not even cover the entrance of most large cat pans."
2,Smaller than I expected,"This product was smaller than I expected, and it seems as though more litter winds up on the floor than caught in the litter mat. Wouldn't recommend."
3,OK cat mat,"The tan mat is gray, but the cats don't seem to mind. :-) Just wish it did something to keep the litter under control. One cat just jumps over it...doesn't like the nubby things. The other cat steps on it but the next step is off from it, so litter isn't kept to the mat. Would be great for a kitten or if it was larger."
4,Works quite well,This does reduce the amount of litter that gets tracked out of the tray. Maybe 90% is retained on this mat.
4,Catches most litter.,"Definitely helps reduce the spreading of litter. It doesn't trap all the litter, but who's to say the cats aren't leaping past it. I know they don't wipe their paws when they are through.Constructed very well, should last."
2,Not Effective,This mat is too small to really be effective. I ordered 2 of them knowing they were small but I still have cat litter everywhere. It does catch some of the litter but too small to catch it all. They were not too expensive but a waste of my money.
2,-,This is a fairly useless product... Way too small even for a small cat. It catches liter about as much as sticking a un-opened garbage bag in place of it does.It was only $10 so I suppose I don't feel ripped off or anything but I am going to continue my search for a 'litter-mat' that actually works and is large enough to do the job.Over all- if you feel like blowing $10 to see if this thing works go for it... it does look a little more classy than using a un-opened garbage bag- but that is the only 'Pro' to the two major 'Cons'
3,Works well but................,"This product works as it's supposed to, trapping litter that the cats drag out of the box. For some reason though, one of my cats like to pee on the mat. I found that if I keep it further away from the litter box, this doesn't happen. This defeats the purpose somewhat though as litter gets tracked on the carpet in between the cat box entrance and the mat.The product is cute and I'm still using it. Something is better than nothing."
1,Don't.,This is too small and my cat would just jump over it rather than subject himself to stepping on hard plastic. A waste of money & too expensive to send back.
2,no need for this,theres aways litter all around anyway. i guess if you really want a mat then this is a good mat but i dont think theres really a need for one.
2,Its to small or my car is to active,my cat is still trying to get all the sand out of the box and well he manages well to get most of it beyond the mat ;)if there is a bigger one try and get that one as this does work its just to small to grab everything.
4,keeps litter from tracking thru the house,"The only aspect of this product that I do not like is the cutesie paw shape of the mat. A simple rectangle or semi-circle would make the product more appealing to me. However, the product works great. It keeps the vast majority of the litter on the mat instead of tracking it through the house. One of our cats is long haired (on the bottom of his paws as well) so we still get some debris transported. However, our short-haired cats are able to use the mat to remove the litter before they leave the room."
2,Didn't work for us,"Is very cute, washes well, and catches some litter...unfortunately it didn't work for us. Perhaps if you have a timid kitty you can get it to walk on the mat but ours would jump over it or have so much litter in their paws that they would shake it off around the small mat as well. It may work for someone else, but in a household of 3 cats, it didn't work for us."
3,There is a God!,"I stumbled across this CD at Best Buy yesterday(of all places). Yes there is a god! Ive been waiting so long for some great players to get together and pump out something like this. Although I hear un-abashed Jaco and Holdsworth similarities , Im still diggin this CD. Patrice is burning the boards,havent heard her play like this since Ponty's early albums. Dennis is on fire as expected. Granted, this isnt music for everyone,and man, I get some strange looks from people when Im blasting it in my car, but thats cool! Its fusion fool!Good Fusion at that!"
5,kumarji's benaras style,"this album shows why pt. kumar bose is widely regarded as an authority on benaras baj. set to teental, the structure is classic. I especially like the uthan and variations kumarji so playfully develops. you will notice some of kumarji's favorite bants..esp. dhige dhina trkta dhinna..which is beautifully played...a different treatment of the same kaida can be heard in the darbar festival album. parts of this album is mesmerizing and might put you into a meditative trance! a must have for any tabla lover esp. who loves the aggressive benaras style."
4,If you've never heard of them get ready for a surprise,Before I saw this DVD I had never heard of the weather underground and was quite taken by the film. How the hell did these people not go to jail. I'm sorry but they were terrorists. I think everybody should watch this because it chronicles an interesting time in history. Just compare them to the Black Panthers. The Panthers were murdered and exiled and some still live in seclusion. The Weathermen declared war on the United States and now they have good jobs. I'm not even saying one group was better than the other but you have to admit thats pretty ironic.
2,Lame,"While I don't agree with any kind of war, I also don't agree with violent demonstrations to get your point across.Other than a couple of interesting film clips of historical moments of which I had only previously seen in print photography (the Vietnamese man about to be shot in the head, the little girl having just been burned by napalm, running down the road) there was not a significant amount of dramatic or even above-average relevant footage featured. While the stories were at times fairly compelling, they only succeeded in making the film simply average."
1,Best Friends,"The Weather Underground is a flop of a movie attempting to romanticize murderous, barely lucid idiots. It stars Barack Obama's best friend William Ayers. For the purposes of this review I am forced to give it at least one star. Nuff said."
4,a great documentary that with todays world should be watched,"in light of othe events taking place worldwide today, this is a great documentary to take in. the govt will always be challenged to a certain degree within the u.s. for policies overseas, but what a noble event in the late 60s early 70s when the weather underground and black panthers, and other groups took a serious stand against the treatment of minorities. superb footage shown, and some of the former members are recounting their roles and their opinions of events going on at this time, that made the uprising so important. particularly the vietnam war, which received much criticism anyway. this is really a great documentary and well put together, with nice footage, great interviews, and some extras on the dvd."
4,A SOBERING LOOK AT A FAILED REVOLUTION,"The violent Weather Underground emerged in the radical 60s with an avowed mission to overthrow the U.S. government. This Oscar nominated film captures the era in archival footage and sensational new interviews with the aged leaders of the organization. This sobering look at a revolutionary movement is a reminder that not all was peace and love and smoking dope and dancing in the park during that infamous decade when everything -- yes, everything -- changed. Oh yes, there WAS a revolution. Just not what the W.U. had planned."
3,Slow Down,"This is a very good documentary. I am interested in the New Left and its evolution into violence from civil disobedience but I think the previous review needs to be toned down. I am anti-racist and anti-war but I am not out blowing up Pentagon restrooms or killing bank guards. I think we can finally reach a point in our evolution where we call a spade a spade - murder in the sake of some political goal can never be tolerated - no matter how benign the intention. The film is interesting because it sheds light on a neglected topic, but make no mistake, the Weather Underground was a dysfunctional group of violent people and they do not need to be unnecessarily romanticized."
2,POLITICALLY CORRECT VERSION OF THE W.U.,"I was a lefty was I was young [not anymore], and I was really looking forward to this dvd. this is a completely sanitized look at the weather underground. some of their members admired sicko charles manson, seems they left that little tidbit out. wonder why? and look who has joined the ""bourgeoisie"" class, these whiny so-called radicals. I wanted to see the history of the american left, warts and all. what a disappointment."
3,Weird world we live in,"They were a radical organization that wanted to overthrow the United States government. The were an offshoot of the SDS (Students for an Democratic Society). Their name came from a Bob Dylan song ""Subterranean Homesick"" (""You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows""). They bombed a lot of places, mostly government buildings.Being guided by hate doesn't accomplish anything lasting so they disbanded in the late '70s. Most of them turned themselves in and because the FBI did a lot of stuff illegally to capture them so they were pardoned. They claimed they were against capitalism yet went on to live middle class lives. One owns a bar in NYC and won $23,000 on Jeopardy! They showed a clip of him at the very end of the movie on the show but not the part where Alex Trebek asks him a question about him. Can you imagine Alex asking him ""So, you belonged to an terrorist group back in the '60s era?"""
4,Somewhat biased documentary,"The documentary is interesting and the filmmakers clearly did their research. They take their time connecting the relationships for the viewers and showing the politics of the time between the Black Panthers, these students groups, etc.What I took away from the film, though, is the sense of hypocrisy of the ""revolutionaries."" They went on television and radio to announce a violent overthrow of the capitalist government, then acted suprised that they are being surveilled by police. A Black Panther comrade is seen describing himself as a revolutionary and dies sometime later in a shoot out with police. No big shock there, people involved in revolutions sometimes die.I don't know who appeared more smug and pleased with themselves, the revolutionaries or Richard Nixon. All in all, it was impossible to tell who the protagonists were because no one was remotely sympathetic."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this unit about a week ago and I will probably send it back tomorrow. I can live with how loud it is but it simply does not cool the air! I've let it run for the past 12 hours and, while I haven't had problems with the water tray despite high humidity, it's only about 5 degrees cooler in the little room than it is outside. In other words, it does a bit better than a regular fan but costs way more to buy and, I'm sure, to power. For a 10,000 BTU rating, it doesn't do half the job of my old 5,200 BTU window unit. I've called the company twice and no one has gotten back to me yet."
4,"Amcor al 10000eh, set it up correctly","This machine has to be set up correctly and it works very well. First, If you put the vent tube directly in line ( use a short table ) with the hole for the round vent tube. Use the vent tube at its shortest. I live in Humid Beverly,MA and in 1 hour I can get a 10x12x9 room 8-10 degrees cooler.Its not noisey at all in my opinion."
3,mislabeled,"bought several ""Cars"". all fine except for this one. wrong car was shipped. seller covered up the correct name with a white sticky label. not worth sending back but grandson unhappy for wanted this car for his collection."
2,Maybe it's just me...,"...but I abandoned ship halfway through. After enjoying the movie, and reading the great praise for author Porter, I assumed I'd enjoy diving into this good, long read. What I discovered was a rambling and excrutiating book...droning characterization page after page until I could no longer concentrate on the essentially non-existent plot.I assume this is strictly for fans of Porter, who was a master at short story telling. She should have stuck to it. Anyone expecting a ""Grand Hotel"" or Maugham like saga will be sorely disappointed."
4,Learned Reading,"This book is more over based on the everyday lives of those who ""thwart in human folly."" Porter's style of writing is delicate and precise. If her style was a painting, it would be the Monalisa with all its graphics of language and detail."
2,The Original is Much Better,"Does not surpass the original work published in the 1500's. There are better books. Read them first. This book lets the ship reach its destination and the fools get off. The book does not establish any personal attachment for any character to the reader; some catalogue of foolish behavior and temperment, but not as exhaustive nor as poetic as Original. At end of book, as a reader you feel like you were one of the fools along for the voyage for reading the book. Nice period piece that illustrates some of racial and ethnic prejudice at the time and forewarnings of the future."
3,"Good, but trundling.","I'm an avid, dogged reader, and I plowed through Tolstoy's War and Peace at a quicker clip than I managed Porter's Ship of Fools. I love Porter's short stories--I cannot recommend more highly purchasing her collected fiction in paperback--but her talent doesn't translate as well into the long work. Unfortunately, I found the characters in this novel uninteresting, the lack of plot without much underlying substance somewhat tiresome, and the entire book as slowly moving as the ship these characters are traveling on from Mexico to Germany in the 1930s. The writing is good, the observations sharp, but I had trouble engaging with this book and, therefore, found myself reading other things before picking it back up. Ultimately, this is a good book by a good author, but it probably is not worth the effort required to trudge through it."
5,Deer Horn Knifes,"Being interested in Bo & Hanbo I decided to try something a little out of the ordenary but living in the UK DVDs on this type of weapon are just not here, in fact you stand more chance of finding rocking horse poo! So imagin my delight when I found this. Its great realy easy to follow and its well filmed you can learn at your own pace but anyone with an insight to any martial art should be able to pick this up in a very short time whats more interesting is your are shown just how to apply this weapon against attacks for other weapons, belive me its worth its weight in gold."
4,For Your Viewing Pleasure,"And what a pleasure it is to view these two episodes (both dated 1955) -- ""Home Cooked Meal"" and ""The Big Jump"" -- from this classic sitcom of the ""Golden Age of Television."" In the first, English teacher Connie Brooks (wisecracking Eve Arden) accidentally locks principal Osgood Conklin (curmudgeonly Gale Gordon) in Madison High's meat freezer. In the second episode, Miss Brooks is ""elected"" to substitute for a ""disabled"" Mr. Conklin in a civic-minded display of an emergency jump from the top of Madison High to a safety net several stories below. Still funny after all these years!"
1,no information available,"I would love to write a real review about this video. However, amazon has not provided ANY information that could possibly lead to someone wanting to buy it -- no description of contents, length, how many episodes, etc. So, how can you decide to buy it and then view it , and then write a review? I would definitely buy this if I knew that it wasn't the same as the other 2 listed for sale. If all three are unique, and if there is more than one episode, it would be worth the money to buy all three videos. It was one of the best comedy series of the 1950's."
1,Save Your Money. DG Let's Us Down Again,DG has once again ruined great Russian music with a trusted name. Jarvi and Shostakovich is also pretty much a blanket keep away also.What is wrong with this Shostakovich 8th? In short it lacks tension and four out of the five movements are based on a certain amount of tension. This is the worse Shostakovich 8th on the market. Ironically the same symphony orchestra the LSO led by the same conductor Previn have the best performance of this work recorded back in 1973 and rereleased on EMI which I highly recommend.If you must have an all DDD digital recording get Haitink or Jarvi. I suppose I would side with Haitink if only because it is recorded with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in their famous resonant hall.Signed. The World's Greatest Shostakovich Fan
3,Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony,"This is not my very favorite symphony by Shostakovich, but it is still good. (The Leningrad Symphony is my favorite so far. I only heard very few symphonies.)Shostakovich's eighth symphony was one of the three special symphonies mainly mentioning about war. This was probably the least known of the three war symphonies, and also the most grim and most violent of all the musical works by Shostakovich. If you want to hear this music, I assure you to listen to Andre Previn's recording with the London Symphony Orchestra. This recording is better than other recordings of Shostakovicn's eighth I heard. Besides, I claim that CDs from the Deutsche Grammophon company give excellent sounds. For people who collect Shostakovich-ian music, this CD is perfect for the collection. And when you listen to the music, feel the terror, the panic, the pain, and the relief meaning peace at the very end of the music."
3,Presario 2570us,"It's a decent notebook. The processor is adequate as is the hard drive. I had a little trouble setting up the wireless network, but I got it working. Love XP pro and the built in firewire. Terrible, terrible battery life. I got about 1hr and 40min w/wifi on and about 2hr without. The speakers were pretty weak, but not inaudible."
4,Useful,"Generally, the most of my computer use comes from downloading music, movies, and burning them onto cd's. this computer does everything well EXCEPT that. The Roxio Easy CD package that comes included in this notebook is poor, at best. I have been able to burn 1 cd in 11 tries. The error messages come up no matter what file type. i Transferred files from a pc, where i used NERO to burn a cd of those files, and attempted to use ROXIO to burn the same files onto a cd, and found error messages kept popping up.Speakers are pretty good, processor and hard drive are adequate, along with the monitor.other weakness: doesnt include windows xp cd. however, you can retrieve it from company if necessary.4 out of 5"
2,Poor quality,"My kitchen towel hem fell apart after the first time i washed it. The ""ravens"" is a decal and faded easily."
4,"""Short yet Sweet""","This is my first album by ""Burnt By The Sun"", ""I Loved it""! Scathing vocals, quick riff changes and tight drumming! Unfourtunately, the album ends to soon, you'll be wanting for more."
5,There's so much talent here....,"I have to say after hearing this ep by ""burnt by the sun"" i was quite amazed at the talent these guys have...Not only are they original but also awsome lirycist with nothing but pure musicianship along with it ! The production on this album was just to good and the riffs are out of this world,my friend. Im realy glad and proud to be a fan of such an wonderfull band like bbts!! I even heard that bbts might de added to ozzfest but im not to sure... Well , if thats true? Good for them because they deserve the break for being such great musicians.The best song on this selftitle ep to me is ""buffy"" i love that track! Well, go in the store and buy bbst's self title ep if you like music that's out of this world and great! Peace !"
3,informative but long,"This is a very informative book, but I feel like it's a bit too long. I also felt like there was a huge emphasis on wars, but I wished there was more information about the culture of Mughal India, especially the lives of women. There were also references to some political figures (not the emperors) without a full description of who these people were. Without a background knowledge of Mughal history, it's hard to figure out who these people are. Despite these negative points, the history of Mughal India is presented in great detail so I'm glad I purchased the book because I learned a lot."
5,Worth the read,"There are very few books out there from the perspective of a 911 call taker/dispatcher. Being a dispatcher myself I took an immediate interest in the subject matter of this book. The author does a good job in portraying what it's like to become a dispatcher, as well as what it's like on the job. I would urge readers to keep in mind that this is only the writings of a single dispatcher who works (mainly?) for this one agency. In short, things are different everywhere, and yet the same also in many senses. Regardless, it is a really good read. I imagine every dispatcher has, at one time or another, said to themselves, ""man, I should write a book""!"
4,Brought back memories!,"I am a retired 911 operator and could relate to this book. I thought it was funny, enlightening, and captured the life of a 911 operator."
5,A Gem of a Book,"Answering 911 is the kind of book you don't want to finish. I read it non-stop from beginning to end and enjoyed every page.The author shares her best, worst and oddest moments from her job as a 911 dispatcher with insight and humor.More, please!"
4,Quick Read,"Very interesting book, I wouldn't say I couldn't put it down, but I did look forward to reading it on a daily basis. It took me thru all the emotions, laughed out loud, and brought me to tears at one point. I can't imagine how difficult it is to stay calm with the gamut of calls you must answer on a daily basis."
4,Have you ever considered what it takes to answer 9-1-1 calls?,"When we think about the emergency services, we tend to think about the police officers and fire fighters who respond to our calls for help. But what about the people who answer our calls and dispatch those responders. What is it like to answer those phones? This book gives us a glimpse into the often frustrating world of dispatch.The author wanted to help people, but was too squeamish to be successful as a nurse or other medical provider, but when she gets a chance to become an emergency dispatcher, she thinks she might have found an answer. The stories she tells here describe the challenges as well as the rewards of this job, and show the author as she grows in her new career and her personal life. This is an eye opening look at what it takes to be an intermediary between the public and those emergency responders who answer our calls for assistance."
3,"Entertaining, funny, and touching","I adore ""behind-the-scenes"" stories like this one, and Burau's book definitely gave me a new perspective on the unsung heroes at the other end of the 9-1-1 line. Burau paints a vivid picture of life in a windowless room, complete with colorful characters and office politics.Well-written, humorous, and touching, the book gets a thumbs-up. But was I the only one who had trouble with the idea that a former drug addict could find her way to such a high-pressure, mission-critical job?"
3,Quick read,Nice easy reading book with some good stories. Might give a very slight insight into a very unknown profession. I have a few good friends that work as dispatchers and I see a very few similarities.
2,No spark.,"Granted this book is written by his child, and is a collection of memories, it seems like a longwinded email from someone obsessed with pinning his miseries on his childhood. Peter Sellers' actions are described in poor detail, just graphic enough to muddle us through his life, and we never explore the motivations of the man. It's unfortunately not overtly sad, funny, or poignant, aside from the beginning of the book, where we see him at the end of his life and comatose in the hospital for all of a dozen pages.A ghostwriter should have been hired, but seemingly wasn't. Read this book only if you've exhausted other Sellers sources."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your money on these things. I would have given it 0 stars if I could, but that wasn't an option. They're a total waste of money. They rip or tear easily when you're trying to inflate the things and they don't do as they are advertised to do."
1,got wrong CD,"i ORDERED BETHOVEN SYMPHONY NO.3,BUT i GOT ""WAGNER"".IT'S WRONG CD.i NEED TO GET MY CD THAT i PAYED FOR."
4,The orchestral playing is great,This performance of the Eroica stands out with a power packed playing by the Berliners. The acoustics are superb. The oboists and the french horns stand out in all the movements and the horns especially in the trio section of the scherzo. Otto Klemperer has taken the Marcia Funebre- Adagio Assai better. The best performance to date is by Leonard Bernstein with the New York Philharmonic.
4,Gambale and the boys rip it up again,"GHS 3-Let me start by saying if you are a fan of amazing guitar playing,execptionally musical bass playing and great fusion drumming,then this record is for you.The compositions not only show the technical prowess of all three players,but they are also very well thought out,and along with their chops melody is king.There are some amazing unison lines played by Gambale and Hamm (Confuse-a-blues & The Challenger)and all-round blazing solos by all three of these monsters.If fusion is your thing its simple ""just but it""."
5,Boy's Choir,"This is a foreign film with many awards, outstanding dramaand you would not believe the descipline in this movieenjoy it is a film you can watch over and over"
1,For Diehard Fans Only,"Unfortunately, this collection is drawn from only two studio albums & one ""live"" one during the duo's years with ABC (1975-77), and is short on worthy ""best-of"" material. Arguably, there are three or four very good songs here, including ""Carry Me"" and ""To The Last Whale."" Beyond that things things go downhill sharply, with a majority of the set consisting of unmemorable filler. If you're a big CSN(Y) fan you probably already own half of these recordings. If not, you probably don't need this CD either."
3,Only works on some tubes,"I've used Slime products on both tube and tubeless tires, with the best results on the tubeless tires. With the tube tires, it's been hit and miss. Some of the tubes admit the fluid with no problem. Others have a restriction in the valve which makes it impossible to get the fluid in. It doesn't matter how hard you squeeze the bottle, the fluid won't pass the restriction.It would have been nice if the manufacturer had documented this and saved its customers time and money."
1,useless,"Here's the deal. I have no idea if this stuff works or not. I have an electric bicycle and I bought this...stuff for emergencies. When I first tried to use it the crappy plastic valve stem remover broke. I complained to the company and to their credit they sent me a proper valve stem remover. It won't fit between my valve and my hub motor. I bought another, shorter one at an auto supply store and it's to wide for my spokes. So, if you have an electric bike and you get a flat on the powered hub wheel it's useless."
2,gave me the creeps,"I read this book to my 4 year old while in a waiting room and by the end was paraphrasing and skipping pages in order to finish up. Basically, the story has kids at a new school behaving robotically ""perfect"" (much like the Stepford Wives), and it turns out that the school is zapping their brains to make kids compliant. I'm not big on censoring what my kids read, but I would not recommend this book. My 4 year old didn't really ""get"" it, but it would surely give my 6 year old nightmares. I thought it was odd that there was no ending message that ""perfect"" isn't really perfect."
3,"Very satisfied with Karajan's interpretation of ""Peer Gynt"" Suites 1&2","I had heard, through Classical 102.1 (KDFC-FM), one part of the entire ""Peer Gynt"" Suites, namely ""In The Hall of The Moutain King"". I was curious about the entire Suites to consider buying the entire album. I enjoy listening to Karajan's interpretation of both ""Peer Gynt"" Suites. He paid very good attention to tempi, and the playing sounds superb."
1,Would not buy this again,"I bought this waffle maker two years ago. After using it for about six months, I noticed that it didn't get as hot as it did when I first bought it. I had to turn it up all the way to ""7"" to get the waffles done. After about two years, it finally died. The orange light came on, but it wouldn't get hot at all. Also, very hard to clean. Very disappointed in this product."
2,Worked fine but . . . . . .,"The waffler waffled fine for about 2 years and then in the middle of a batch it quit heating. Checked with customer service since it was supposed to be on a 3-yr warranty but since I didn't have a receipt and the cord was missing the date of mfg. stamp, they couldn't help me. It really made great waffles but it certainly wasn't overworked. I used it to make 1-2 waffles about every 1 - 2 months, not much before it failed."
1,Worked Great for a Year ... and then it malfunctioned and burnt me,"When my husband and I first got our waffle maker, we couldn't believe how well it worked - at this price point, nothing could be better. A couple of months ago the lock that holds the waffle plate upright while you're pouring batter and removing the waffle broke in the middle of using the waffle maker. It slipped to the side and burnt the inside of my arm. Three months later, I still have a scar and I can no longer in any way recommend this waffle maker. I'm going to purchase something slightly more expensive (e.g., KitchenAid) that hopefully has more of a focus on ensuring that parts continue to work. If you do choose to buy this, BE CAREFUL."
1,2 units died on me,I received this waffle maker as a gift and I loved it- until it stopped working 11 months later. It failed to heat up. I sent my broken unit back to the company since it was still under warranty and they sent me a new one. I had the new one for about a year and a half when it too stopped heating up. I called the company again and they said it was no longer under warranty and they offered me a discount on a new waffle maker. I declined their offer. I only used the waffle makers once or twice per month and I was disappointed they didn't last longer.
1,REALLY DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this COMPANY,"I wondered what could have gone wrong with a wafflemaker that was only used a dozen times??? When I read these reviews I realized that I had plenty of company. The wafflemaker LOOKS beautiful. WHEN it works you love it. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has used defective parts in its construction and will not own up to it. I had a Sears wafflemaker for 36 years and it was still working when I discarded it for this glizty looking model. BIG MISTAKE. The only way to protect consumers from having their money stolen is to REFUSE to buy Villaware products until they change their ways. REALLY DISGUSTED and DISAPPOINTED."
1,A bad purchase,"I purchased this waffle iron as a hostess gift for a friend. It worked only once. The second time my friend used it, it did not heat up. In September 7, 2011 I wrote to Jardin Consumer Solutions asking that the waffle iron be replaced. On September 12 they promised to send a replacement within 6 to 8 working days. It is now October 18 and the replacement waffle iron has not arrived. It is very embarrassing to give a gift which breaks. I will send another letter to Jardin Consumer Solutions."
1,Horrible POS-- gave 1 star because the review would not take none,"As a long-time waffle maker, I thought I'd splurge on a nice, if somewhat expensive Belgian waffle maker. It is the worst product I have ever used. At least in the small applicance category. It is going in the trash today. It has a nagging tendency to stick, no-stick surfaces notwithstanding. It has a flimsy metal clip that is supposed to keep the swivel mechanism locked in place. It broke on the third use. Sine then, it will not stay upright when you turn it to extract the waffle. Extract is the right word, too, since I have to peel one half off, try to get the other, then reassemble on a plate. Dreadful, terrible, awful. Now for how I really feel......"
1,Painful experience,"If you're ready for a nice Sunday morning waffle and relax with the morning newspaper - then don't buy this - you'll spend an hour shaking your fist at it, peeling the waffle in pieces off of it. It worked fine for about 3 months, and then gradually got worse to the point that the waffle would never extract. Yes it looks nicer than the Waring, but the objective is to make good waffles every time - and this thing fails miserably."
3,"First one was GREAT, second one sticks","This waffle maker makes great waffles when it's working correctly. This is the second one we've had and while we LOVED the first one, the second one seems to have problems with the nonstick coating. We have to oil the crap out of ours just to make sure the waffles don't get stuck. They really are great waffle makers, but make sure if you have any issue with the nonstick coating, to send it back and get a new one right away!"
1,Burned out,"It won't heat up anymore. Bought this waffle maker 4 or 5 years ago but we only use it a couple of times a year. So that's 10 uses or so at 5 or 6 waffles per use. That's 60 waffles if you do the math. To make matters worse I paid a lot more than it's selling for now on Amazon. I think I paid $120. The waffles were great, but $120 for 60 waffles earns 1 star in my book. I won't be buying another VillaWare product."
1,GRRRRR!!!,"Weekend one, great waffles. A bit tricky on the speed at which you need to get the thing flipped but not undoable.The next week end, a tiny piece of black plastic falls out. Now the machine will not close properly. without the ability to close, it won't make waffles. Was mine the one bad one??? I know I am not buying anther."
2,Great Waffles but Cheap Plasticy Design Broke Quickly,"This makes delicious deep waffles, but unfortunately mine broke after about 6 uses. The black handle part is made of very cheap plastic. Part of this plastic fell apart and now mine will not close or turn properly. Comes with a 3 year warranty but now I have to pay for shipping to ship it back and have it repaired. Definitely wouldn't go for this one again."
4,Fantastic Waffles,This waffler makes some great waffles. No need to go to go the restaurant anymore for waffles.
1,cheaply built but not priced,I liked this company's VillaWare V2003 UNO Petite Heart Waffler but this item broke the first time I used it. Too much plastic. Poor design. I did manage to keep it together for several uses but the waffles stuck badly each time despite all the flawless waffles made on their other product.
2,My waffle maker quit working this Christmas,"My husband gave me this waffle maker about three years ago. I may have used it less than ten times during those three years. This year; Christmas day I make one waffle turned out great, got ready to do the second and noticed it was not maintaining heat. When it worked it is a great waffle iron; but I feel for the price and the few times I used it; I think it should have held up allot longer. Very disappointed."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"If you're looking for some fun, Bluegrass-ish Christmas music, this cd does NOT deliver like you think it would! The songs are hokey, and many of them are not familiar tunes. I DO NOT recommend this item."
1,Not like Smokey Mountain,Not what I was expecting or hoping for at all.One or two songs are decent. However the recording was substandard (one song louder than the next)and Most of the various groups on this CD were way to Hillbilly for my liking. There maybe some folks who enjoy this type of music but I will be hanging this CD in my peach tree to scare off birds.
4,Mountain Music,Looking for mountain music...here it is! We love bluegrass and found this to be a good cd for Christmas music.
2,Not What I Expected,Censored video/lyrics with huge 'MetalBlade' logo plastered on every video. Must have been made for Mtv. Glad I bought used and cheap.
1,save your money,I don't know if theres a Grammy for worst video. If there is this wins it hands down.This SUCKS!
5,Perfect 2 disc sleeve,"I was making a DVD for my students in my class. It turned out to be 2 DVD's instead of one. These holders are not the highest quality (meaning I could buy a slim plastic case), but for my purpose it was perfect. I burned the DVD's and handed them out to my kids. It is a great product."
2,you got what you paid for,What I expected was solid two sided sleeves. What I got was thin slippery sleeves that really don't stack well. Now I will have to get boxes to store them in after I fill them with CD/DVD's.
4,Required reading for students of mereology,"I don't have much to add that the other reviewer hasn't already said, but I want to make a couple of points about this text.First is that it is still the best survey of mereology to date. There have been some solid additions to the field that are more recent, but most of them spend more time arguing for a particular philosophical or ontological conclusion than discussing mereological theories and their relationships.The second point is that this text is too often read solely as a survey of theories of mereology. While the early sections of the book do focus on the formal consequences of different systems, most of the latter part of the book is dedicated to ontological/philosophical questions. I would wager to say that if you are interested in the philosophical problems surrounding persistence or composition, you will find the author's discussion of these problems useful."
4,Great book; very useful,My wife is a text book writer and has found this gift text to be quite valuable. Recommended
2,Too much drama,"A film for drama and histerical performances' fans. And for people who loves Barcelona (nice pictures).If you are not any of them, skip this one.I am trying to figure out what irritated me the most - the acting or the plot? I think it's the acting that is ""as nice"" as a sound made by a nail against a blackboard.The actress playing Paul's mother is histerical. It is painful to listen to her lines and watch her behavior on the screen. In fact the second part of the movie is played in such manner by each of main characters.A lot of scenes look and sound fake - like the gays mothers' meeting or the the part, where she hits on Richard in his hotel room or (you can add here your own)...As far as I am concerned, this film is a huge disappointed. Second star for pictures of Barcelona and music."
3,Decent but no triumph,"The film has strong possibilities but doesn't quite accomplish what it set out to do. As with many independent films, certain aspects of the filmmaking process have been sacrificed (typically because of budget reasons), so the film winds up stagey and stiff at points. Despite a few strong performances, I found the acting unconvincing on the whole. While I have not read the book, the characterizations felt incomplete.Certainly this isn't a bad film, but it simply fails to satisfy."
2,Good acting; Disappointing Story,"So much potential and so little fulfillment. This film has some great acting by Kevin Bishop (Paul) and his mother played by Juliet Stevenson. Their chemistry is evident. Not so though with Bishop and the object of his affection (Paul Rhys) and all the other older men he seems to get involved with. It would have been nice to explore Paul's character a little more to find out the whos, the wheres and the whys of him. Sure we know he has a thing for older men...he's looking for a father figure....but we know nothing of what leads up to the breakup of his parents. His mother comes off as an irritating shrew .... especially in a scene where she comes on to Richard Kennington, the man her son is fooling around with. But the acting is first rate. Too bad the story is one note and very disappointing. This movie could have been so much better."
3,3 creeps and a grown-up,"The only adult in this coming-of-age story is the teenage Paul, an aspiring concert pianist. He comes to accept who he is. He realizes that he will never play as well as he wants to. He also discovers his homosexuality and he gets on with his life in a 'live-and-learn' calm manner. The other characters were unlikable. There is a creepy concert pianist, Richard, that Paul loves and idolizes. There is Richard's ghoulish manager, Joseph. And ther is Paul's psychotic, scenery-chewing mom. It was painful to watch these adults act like kids. But maybe that was the point. You have to put with the people in your life.I read David Leavitt's novel ""The Page Turner"" after I saw this DVD and would recommend it."
5,"A great and touching movie, excellent in all areas.",".This is a moving and well-made film about a young music student (Kevin Bishop) coming to terms with his sexuality, and his coming of age amid the world of professional music. Juliet Stevenson is brilliant as the boy's mother, who experiences an awakening of her own. It was filmed entirely in Barcelona with British actors, though most of the characters are American and the story takes place primarily in the US. A top-notch cast and production, augmented by an excellent musical score of classical music. This is a movie of subtle nuances and inevitable truths, and is not to be missed."
1,Huh!???,I have quite a few recordings of this work from Piero Coppola to Biggs/Munch; my last count is about 100. This recording is a vast disappointment. Latry at Liege is much better. This seems to be cut and paste. I tried finding in the accompanying notes if they were even in the same building. I have been looking for a performance at Notre Dame because of the organ. The organ is fine; the orchestra okay [wobbly intro - reminiscent of LPs!]; and 38 minutes????? on a CD? My first live performance was of Munch and Biggs in the late 50s. BSO strings at their best; Biggs and the organ left me WOW! Biggsy must have turned all of it on [maybe even the celestes - organist no-no]. My recommendation -- skip it!!!
3,"Great crunch, not so great flavor!","Let me preface this review by saying that most of my friends see me as the original ""health nut."" And it's true. I shop mainly at health food stores for my groceries and eat the kind of foods that would make most people raise an eyebrow or two. So my tastes run a little different from the average American's.But even I think that these Mary's Gone Crackers Herb flavored crackers taste terrible. The flavor of rosemary is just far too overpowering to be enjoyable for me.Having said that, I greatly appreciate the other fine qualities of this cracker-- crispy, satisfying, holds onto dips quite well. Oh, and it's ridiculously healthy, too.So I'll try the other flavors and see how it goes. But unless you *love* the flavor of rosemary, I'd steer clear of this particular flavor."
1,was really loking forward to a good cracker...,"WEll...this product isnt that. IT is cruchy like a chip, we are used to that, but the herb is SOOOO STRONGGG, It might be good to stuff turkey with or something, I would still be afraid it would be overwhelming. I tired adding cheese to it I used it in a meatloaf, had to throw it away, not 1 in my family could eat it!! Maybe a plain cracker from this produt would be good, it didnt fall apart when you bit into it, which is always good...lol, But for me anyway, the herb flavor was wayyyyy toooo muchhh, and I love herb flavoring, I have lemon and herb on my chicken all the time, 1 of my favorite meals.But I do have a girlfriend that is gluten intolerant also, and she thinks they are great. SO you might want to go to a site where you can get it as just 1 box instead of a case if you decide to try it.hope this helps someone.Have a GREAT day!Cindy"
4,Like the cracker DONT ORDER IF EXPECTING QUICK SERVICE,"My Mom turned me onto these crackers and my son and I really like them. I understand this is a product review and that is why the 4 stars. However, this seller took 5 working days to even get them in the mail. Delivery time was good through USPS getting item mailed is less than acceptable."
2,"Great Crunch, Not So Great Flavor","As much as I like the original flavor crackers, unfortunately I cannot say the same for the herb flavor. Same great nutty crunch, but the herbs, especially rosemary, are way too strong giving these a bitter, almost medicinal taste. Yuck."
2,Healthy but painful!,"Freshly diagnosed with Celiac disease, I ventured to Whole Foods to find some delicious gluten-free snacks. These came highly recommended by an employee. Though the taste is pleasing, they literally hurt my teeth to chew! Every few bites I have to check to make sure all my teeth are in tact. I am 26 yrs old with great oral hygiene and have never had a problem like this before!"
1,Absolutely Awful,"I recently bought these crackers to go along with a soup I had for lunch. Being fairly new to the whole GF scene I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I didn't expect the crackers to be as bad as they were. The taste was simply awful - I can't quite place the taste other than to say that there were burnt undertones and a TON of rosemary. I was glad to have salami to put on top of the crackers to mask their taste. I will definitely not be buying these again."
5,Love em,"The best headset you can buy (at least at this price). I'd say they last at least 2 years under heavy daily use. Comfortable fit, soft foam.This company's headsets are built to 2x the quality of Logitech. The foam windscreen is a nice addition and the mic is very adjustable.About a year ago, my old pair started to fail. I bought the same model, and if these fail, I'll buy another set. Headphone cables break in a matter of time. So on comfort and overall quality, I choose these."
3,"Good sound, pretty comfortable","I would have rated it higher but when I opened it, the wire was stuck to itself. That is to say the rubber coating on the wire was stuck to the coating on other places on the same wire. I tried to be careful to peel it away, but the coating tore and I had exposed wire in six places. I don't know if the problem comes from manufacturing or if it was stored at too high a temperature.I'm living overseas right now. So, it's not worth trying to return it. It works. I put some electrical tape on it.The sound is pretty good and it's pretty comfortable for the price."
1,premature dilapidation,"In terms of sound quality and comfort, I initially found this product to be worth its price. I especially liked the flexible mic. That lasted less than two months, at which point it stopped working after I had paused my voice rec program for an hour. Finito. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
4,"A Great Beginning Book - gather, recycle, or use reed.","Covers wicker, splint, coiled & twined basketry, using commercial and gathered materials, lots of natural material prep info, including natural dyes. Two projects in each method, clear photo demonstrations. Coiling projects are one reed and one fiber, 7 different closed coil stitches described. This book makes me want to branch out!"
1,NOT over the head,"These headphones are not over the head, they are behind the head and under the neck. awful. they hurt my ears. they are small and tight, and I have a small head. I threw away the box and can not return them, my bad. Do noy buy these-they are painful! ouch. Get something else."
1,Believe it or not...,... they actually don't work. At all. Period. Might as well give your money to a charity.
1,"Very sad, It did not work I","Is the firht time that I recived something in bad condition, This wireless earphone are bad."
4,Nice cookie cutter set.,Good cookie cutters but picture is a little deceiving the smallest shape is allot smaller then it appears in the picture but other than that i am happy with it :)
4,A good mix,"A good collection for someone fairly new to classical guitar. I have over 300 guitar recordings, but I still enjoyed this CD - a good one on the road, for example. Nice pieces and performances."
4,The title says it all.,"This is an autobiographical slice of Chester Aaron's life as he waas intoduced to garlic growing and became a garlic devotee. Aaron and his cat take the reader into the world of garlic,its many varities, and how to best grow these bulbs of life. At the end of the book are thirty recipes for tasty garlic dishes. It is a very readable primer on garlic growing."
5,More than just garlic,"Take a good helping of witty memoir, add a handful of very useful gardening/farming information, & a huge heap of garlic (and recipes) and you have a marvelous book. Highly recommended."
2,Poor Video Quality,I have the original VHS tape and was eagerly anticipating the remastering to DVD. It is a major disappointment! The video quality doesn't compare with the VHS.
2,Where is Diana?,"The two-star review is not for Diana's performance. She deserves five stars for her magnificent performance. But this cheaply made video is just a quick cash-in. No doubt, this is a much loved video that has been highly anticipated for DVD release. Unfortunately, this DVD is not worth waiting for.While it sounds great, the picture is horrible. On my TV (28 inches screen), the screen is blurry and cropped. You cannot see things in sharp contrast. I put it in my DVD-Rom and got a sharper image. But I would rather play this on TV.This is a disappointing DVD. I hope HBO or Motown or whatever company produced this video contact the makers of the DVD since it is certainly not an official Diana Ross release. It's a cheap transfer from VHS to DVD.Fans of Diana Ross and this concert video have been warned."
3,"Too subdued, despite the great orchestra","In his final go at the last three Tchaikovsky symphonies, made within a few years of his death, Karajan reached a degree of autumnal eloquence missing in his previous cycles. This Fourth Sym. from 1985 is iwth the glorious Vienna Phil., like the Fifth and Sixth to follow, but it doesn't rise as high. Despite the mellow playing, or perhaps because of it, Karajan's reading lacks bite and thrust. It is also rather dully recorded, so despite my enthusiasm for the other two CDs, which are in quite good sound, I'd call this Fourth a miss."
4,Real Deal Appeal,"Roxy Martin's book was an enjoyable read. It's slightly frightening to a potential patient to now have first hand knowledge of how much contempt the medical profession has for patients. I will be on guard in the future, whether it is on my behalf or on behalf of a loved one. This was not a well written book though. Could have used a good proofing for grammar to make it more of a deep, memorable read. Instead, I felt as if I were listening to a good friend over coffee or a beer and hearing a multitude of heart stopping experiences from her exciting and trying career as an Emergency Room Nurse. Again, a very enjoyable and educating read."
4,I would watch again.,This movie was interesting and kept us on the edge of our seats. It truly makes a person wonder about all the facts we do not know.
3,not what i thought,I don't understand the concept of this movie. If you want a movie to laugh at and make fun of as you are watching it this is the movie for you.
1,Absolutely Horrible Movie,"I sat through this whole movie expecting to see at least a twist in the ending and I got nothing, not pay off, no excitement. Just plain boring talking the whole time with hardly any horror or violence. I read the outline to this story a year before it came out in a survey I took and the ending had a twist but the movie did not at all. I was extremely disappointed that nothing happened in this movie. Nothing exciting. I cannot believe that this came to the theaters and made money. This is some student straight to dvd type of film. Absolutely boring. If you want to be bored, this is for you. I had such high hopes for this movie. So sad."
2,WAIT FOR IT ON THE PREMIUM CHANNELS,"Although, The Devil Inside is not a horrible movie, I still felt I paid too much for it as an Instant Video! Like many before me have said, the predictably was so bad that I had to force myself to stop rolling my eyes (it was giving me a headache, I was rolling them so often). By the time the movie ended, I felt like I was possessed... with boredom and regret. I would, however, recommend this movie on Halloween on VH1 (but never when you are paying for it directly). The Devil Inside seemed to be making a statement against the Catholic Church for not approving more exorcisms, and forcing people to suffer through a possession. I don't think the people who made this movie realized that the only people suffering was their target audience!"
1,"I Can't Stress To You Enough, How Terrible This Movie Is...","I am a huge fan of scary movies, especially exorcism scary movies, and I even like some bad scary movies because they are so bad they are almost good. But this movie is the all time worst movie ever made. I absolutely hated it and hated everything about it. The main character made me so angry that I was happy when she might have died in the end. I say might have died because the end was a cliffhanger. But not even a good cliffhanger where you can't wait for the next movie to come out so you can find out what happened. No, in the movie when the movie ended, I was just so happy that it ended, that I don't care at all what happened to any of the charters. I can only fantasize that they all died. The movie was completely predictable, not at all scary unless you are a complete half-wit or unless you've never seen a single scary movie before. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or movie renting or buying this movie."
1,Horrible,"Yet another Exorcist knock off. Terrible acting, terrible plot, and even more annoying camera instability ( apparently, this is to add a ""documentary"" feel ). Did I mention this is horrible? Please do yourself a big favor and skip this one."
2,Bad Ending...,"It took a while for this movie to get going and then when it did, it does what all artsy movies do and seemingly cut off the end leaving it to your imagination, I guess. The room of people who watched in my house was not happy."
3,A review from a paranormal/supernatural fan,"Now I watch a lot of paranormal/supernatural stuff like paranormal activity, Amytiville (sp?) haunting, exorcism of Emily rose, and other weird movies along the lines, I saw previews and I thought ""this movie looks good, I'll give it a try"" me and my girlfriend watched it in theaters and to be honest I thought it was a really good movie, but then. . . The ending, itll leave you hanging worse than any other movie you'll see, at least paranormal activity made you think ""omg I can't believe that happened, I want more"" the movie left me thinking ""wtf? That's how it ends?"" worst ending I've ever seen in a movie, I give it probably 4 stars for the movie and scares and all that but if I could I'd give it 0 stars for the ending, the ending alone made me hate the movie, everyone will have their own opinions, but if you like movies that leave you hanging, this one should be on the top of your list, if you don't like those movies, don't get this, it isn't worth it"
3,Not bad for a scary movie,"I was alright for the genre of movie. I jumped a few times, but demonic possesion movies are kind of been there done that. My kids loved it though1"
5,Loved this movie!,Awesome movie! Watched this one in theaters and definitely had to add it to my collection. Buy it buy it!
2,"I have low standards, but... seriously?","I'm not even sure where to begin. The idea of demonic possession, even for a self-described atheist such as myself, is inherently creepy. I've seen my fair share of movies on the subject and I almost always find something worthwhile in them. When I started the movie, I had no expectations, which I suppose is good, since it wouldn't have lived up to any of them.Aside from a creepy (but very brief) performance by Suzan Crowley, the acting teetered between uninspired and over-the-top. The characters were uninteresting and under-developed, the story itself was extremely ""ho hum,"" and the ending literally made me laugh out loud. Not because it was funny, but because it was so abrupt and unsatisfying, that all I could think of was, ""Is that seriously the end of the movie?""This might literally be the worst movie I've seen this year. And I just watched ""The Darkest Hour"" a few weeks ago. That's how bad. Seriously."
1,one of the most overrated movies of all time,absoulute garbage its one of those movies where they show all the scary scenes in the trailer and the endng is terrible.
4,For Those who Like the Subject...,"I went to the theater to see this film after only seeing a couple of previews so I only had minimal knowledge of the film content before seeing it. However, I do enjoy movies about exorcisms as well as possession so I figured I would give it a chance. After all, I didn't think it would be any worse than the ""Last Exorcism"" that was out last year. After watching it I can say that I honestly enjoyed the film, granted it was not the best movie ever made, but it was far from the worst crap I have seen. Maybe since I have interest in the subject matter of Psyche vs Possession debate that the slower parts of the film still held my interest. Definatetly not a film for serious Michael Bay film fans, not enough explosions to hold their attention. As for the ending of the film, I felt that it was a fitting way to wrap it up as any."
1,90 minutes of your life you won't get back,I never write a product review but I wanted to write one to warn others about this movie. Everything you need to know about this is in the trailer. The nun on the front is actually a passerby in a scene and nothing to do with the film at all. If you want to see a really poor exorcist meets blair witch then this is for you. I regret watching this as my neither my wife nor myself enjoyed it despite the beautiful italian architecture that it doesn't even appreciate.
2,Really?!,"It wasn't so much a bad movie, as it was just a strange movie... I love horror, including cheesetastic campy horror, but this movie just didn't do it for me. It was so cliched & formulaic, I called every major scare/event at least 5 mins before it was going to happen."
1,disappointing,I am so disappointed in this movie. I watched it with an open mind but this is a horrible movie and i LOVE the genre. DO NOT waste your time watching this one! If you are in the mood for this type of movie watch the Exorcist and skip this wannabe.
4,Good possession flick,Pretty scary possession movie. Definitely worth a look at. I always love these type of flicks and the mother is a scary one.
2,If you are bored,"To make it easy the movie is very boring, and predictable. I would skip unless you really have to watch something, the only + side is the movie is free on prime."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!,"I will keep this short and sweet. I really thought they would do much better with the plot. But I was DEFINITLY wrong! Also, spoiler. If you are easily upset when an infant or kid gets harmed, don't watch it. Sorry to spoil, but had to say it. And THE ENDING SUCKS!"
5,Even scarier than the exorcist,"The films is so goddamn realistic that after I walked out of the theater I was thinking if this was indeed a real case.The acting was good, there were a lot of good scares, and the ending was so BRILLIANT.I think this can be one of the best foumd footage movies since blair witch project and REC"
1,How do you say SUCKS in Italian?,"Cheap exorcist import rip-off from, of all places, Italy. You would think they would be able to make a better exorcism movie since all they need do is spend some quality time chatting up the priests, cardinals and maybe even El Popo. But not, this was the lamest excuse for a horror movie since Blair Witch. There is some value in this movie though. If you are allergic to sleeping medications and have insomnia, WATCH THIS! You will fall asleep and get a great night's rest without the reactions and next-day hang-over. My six year old step-son makes up more horrifying tales than this. It was a bland as eating a slice of white bread for supper. Had I paid for a theater ticket back when this was making its rounds I would have been most unhappy. Seriously, the low-ratings you see are real, no names were changed to protect the innocent. This is wrong as...well...let's just leave it at that."
3,Weird,"The movie ""The Devil Inside"" is pretty ok. It does not scared me. It talked about the devil possessed some people."
1,Horrible Movie...the fourth kind is much better!,"This movie was terrible from start to finish. The plot, style and acting reminded me of the the fourth kind movie. The the fourth kind really scared me since it had real life tapes and flipped back and forth. This movie seemed far fetched and over done for the genre that it is. I would save your money, its not worth it!"
1,Seems to be more going on than explained,"It's a steady cam movie. But it's so harsh that you really don't care about the characters.There seems to be alot of back story that's only hinted at. Like each character has a deep story in their past, but who knows what it is is anyone's guest.It's obvious too, that the producers wanted to make a franchise out of this like the Paranormal Activity movies with the abrupt ending.Avoid."
1,"Another ""shaky cam"" movie that wants to be scary","Sometimes I hate ""The Blair Witch Project"". Since that movie premiered we have had dozens and dozens of hand held camera movies that try to be scary and The Devil Inside is yet another. Unfortunately, it does not deliver on the scary promise.The idea is interesting enough, I suppose, but from the outset I just did not care about any of the people. And nor did I see anything new and different. The ending left me further disappointed and nearly angry, as did the short run time of 1 hour and 15 minutes.If possible, take a pass on this one."
1,the devil inside,"Had a some hope for this one after reading reviews here however all was lost with the first scene...back to shaking camera and flashlight lighting. Man, when is it going to stop with this approach to low budget films. the fake documentary style is just so over done and stale ..glad it was a redbox flick(money wise) but still waste of time sitting through it. I like to rent movies because of all the crap on the tube but recently its been a wash with the movies coming out nowadays"
1,Call me jaded,"Enough with the cinematic ""Blair Witch"" approaches to horror films - it's been done. When will there be a movie that surpasses the Director's Cut of The Exorcist? Probably never. Not once did The Devil Inside make me jump out of my seat or surprise me in any way. I forced myself to watch it in its entirety only to be overwhelmingly disappointed. Don't waste your time. ""I wish I had four hands so I can give this film four thumbs down."""
3,It was alright,"It wasn't as bad as everyone was making it out to be. The exorcisms were scary enough. The only thing I didn't like was the whole fake ""documentary"" feel throughout the whole thing."
5,Great scary movie,Who doesn't love a scary movie. Some of the scenes caught me off guard. I rented this and liked it so much that I bought it.
4,the devil inside,"i""m not one for scary movies, but even so this scared the s*** out of me. overall this movie is very entertaining."
3,"too amateur, and incomplete ending.","Filmed like a college-level film student documentary, ending was incomplete, made little sense and didn't even try to keep the audience hooked to see if there might be a sequel."
2,misleading of course,"just to get viewers this movie tricks you into thinking its shot in an exorcist type fashion. ya know, with a plot and all this. false. its a stupid teenager thriller that's ""a true story"". that's fine just preview the movie correctly."
1,BOY THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME,"I LOVE A B AND SOMETIME C HORROR AND THRILLER MOVIES, BUT WHEN I SAW THE COMMICAL FOR THIS MOVIE I WAS LIKE WOW THIS LOOKS SO GOOD, WELL I WAS WRONG, WENT TO THE MOVIES AND SAW THIS AND WAS FALLING ASLEEP DURING IT, THE COMMICAL SHOWS PRETTY MUCH ANY GOOD PARTS OF THIS MOVIE AND THERE WASNT NOTHING THRILLING OR SHOCKING ABOUT THIS MOVIE, AND THE ENDING WAS JUST THE WORST, I DONT SEE HOW THEY CAN MAKE THESE MOVIES THAT ARE SO BAD, THIS ONE SHOULD OF WENT STRAIGHT TO TV AND SKIP PTHE STRAIGHT TO DVD,"
2,Not good,We had high hopes for this movie but it disappointed us. The first 30 minutes were good and then it stunk. How could they write such a bad movie !Don't waste your time.
1,THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD....IT MAKES CHEESY/B MOVIES LOOK GOOD!,"ONE OF THE WORST ""HORROR"" FLICKS I'VE SEEN SO FAR.....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! THE MOVIE WAS SHOT ON A ""CAMCORDER"" STYLE FROM BEGINNING TO END!"
4,Good.except for...,"this movie is worth watching. it is a great movie. i dont know why so many people hated it. but, the ending sucked! i was so pissed about it!"
5,best exorcism flick in years,"Five stars. I can't believe anyone watched it and gave it less than at least four. Another excellent indie with stellar performances by a non-celebrity cast. I don't know quite how to describe it. I generally hate these faux-documentary ""found film"" type movies which have proliferated to an extreme since the original Blair Witch Project (which I did like, mostly), especially the big-budget ones. This one was both both credible in the way it was scripted and edited, and while not entirely unpredictable, still delivered high impact creep and/or outright scares. It used the fact that you KNOW or at least suspect what's coming next to its advantage which I think is a great compliment to its producers, cast, writer, director, editor, and crew."
4,what's so bad about this movie... ?,"I honestly, don't see a thing about this movie. People say the end ruins the whole thing.. I personally liked the end. :) it's mysterious & leaves a big twist in the movie! 4 stars ! If not 5 !"
2,No new ground broken,"Okay, somebody was possessed, there are attempts at exorcism, a trip to Rome, mental hospital, demon keeps going from one person to another, and none of this is anything new."
3,Devil movie,"I didnt think this movie deserved a lot of the really bad reviews it got. I saw it anyway and it was ok. I do admit there were things that could have been done better but all in all, it was a lot better than most people led me to believe. An average movie. Some parts dragged and others were good.Several people I know saw it and they hated it. After talking to them, for reasons I cannot understand, most people thought this was a based on a real life situation and that it all really happened. This is not based on a real life story, it is made up. That fact alone should make it more bareable for some viewers. You either like excorcism movies or not.This is definately not in the same level as The Excorcist so dont expect anything like that. It is a movie filmed documentary style as a young woman goes overseas & tries to get an excorcism done on her mother."
2,un clavo,"The cover of the DVD is the scariest part of the movie. The exorcisms were somewhat scary, but the ending... I put up with the Blairwitchness and the bad acting hoping for a scary conclusion. There wasn't one. This movie is for people who like dialogue."
2,save your money.,"don't even bother to watch this movie. they shuld pay you to watch it. exorcism ademon possession should be creepy, this film however was more bondage and shrieking than anything else. Even the lame Smurfs movie was scarier."
2,Worst horror movie ending EVER!,"The ending of this film was so bad they should just give it away for free.The movie was ok, had a good story, but the ending killed the whole momentum that it had. This COULD have been an overall outstanding film if the writers had put more effort into the story."
1,Well Umm!,Wow a very deep found footage type film that should be found at the very deep end of a 5 million ton garbage can! It's not a horror film its a horrid horrible film..
1,Wasted time.....,"This was recommended to me by the Latin teacher at the high school where I work. He thought it was great and he's a brilliant teacher. But I was very disappointed. If you like jerky camera work (Blair Witch, etc.) and watching contortionists play demon possessed people, this might be your cup of tea. It was NOT mine and the ending totally sucked. I found myself thinking 'What....?? That's it??"" I wasted my Friday night.......wish I had the time back...."
1,Stock Photo Does NOT Match Item,"Contacted seller (HorseLoverZ / EasyPetStore) on Amazon and eBay about this item. Claimed manufacturer gave her the stock photo. The manufacturer denied this saying that the picture is NOT of the item. The photo and the item do not match. In the photo, it shows three separate hinged partitions. The item only has one hinge.Communication from the seller is poor and NOT recommended."
3,poor man's Herzog,"i've long been a die hard Herzog's fan but i think this one is justtoo commercial unlike other old good Herzogs. it looks like it is forsale and not for in-depth views of human psyche. superficial, easyconclusions. the big boy hero performed just fine, it's a pitty thetalented magician actor was not exploited more (Kinski used to be usedbetter). not bad, after all, but you have been warned."
3,3.5 stars for these country cousins!,"Firstly, I did not find this album as tight as I had expected it 2 be. The first single, Sick of Being Lonely, which was a fairly weak song if you think about it, actually turns out to be one of the best on the album. Tell you something doesn't it?There is no way that many people can relate to this album. Only down south country folks into hip-hop will fully get what all the slang terms mean. Me, being from New York City, had to travel all the way to East Atlanta to ask my cousin what Roota to the Toota meant. I found out from him that it meant to cook a pig whole.The second single, All I know with Cee-lo wasn't bad at all, but I found the rapping weaker and the hook got annoying after about 10+ listens. Haters and Cut loose were also tight songs on this album, though not much.In the end, I think you should borrow this CD from a friend or someone else who paid for it and burn it. I don't feel that it is worth anymore than 10 of my dollars...Enuff SaidPeece"
2,2.5 Stars,I like the Dirty South but not this they have 2 songs I like and thats Sick of being Lonely and Where are you going but the other songs to me isnt all that Field Mob no diss I just couldnt get into it
2,Not as good as I was led to believe,"I bought this album based on the normally flawless reviews on theonion.com AV section and the reviews here.Maybe i just don't get it, but there was nothing that struck me as spectacular on this album. Give me Jurassic 5, Blackalicious, or PeanutButter Wolf any day, but i sold this one to the used record store after my 5th listen"
2,Colors Fade!,Product is great at first until the colors start to fade away. Then its just a black and whit plate.
2,Little cheesy,"It would be a perfect gift if it didn't look cheesy. It's a bit bulky and, as the description says, plastic."
1,LICENSE PLATE FRAMES,"The Livermore, CA 94551 Postal Service stole my package and I never received my license plates. They said they've had to wait for my complaint, and never got back to me. I've talked to him on 3 occassions, and they said the courier on that day delivered it to my home, when infact HE did not. They stole my license plates. I never got them."
3,"COMBAT! Episode ""The Flying Machine""","This episode features Rick Jason (Lt. Hanley) on a solo mission away from the squad as he goes on a surveillance flight with a cantankerous pilot (Keenan Wynn). Their single-engine monoplane, of course, crashes, and the two are in for an adventure behind enemy lines. From the 1960s WWII series, ""Combat!"" [Note: no other cast members from the show appear in this episode]"
1,The Light and the Glory,This is not a history book. It is pseudo-historical religious propaganda. The best thing that can be said about it is that the preface clearly lays out the authors' bias. Read it if you want a glimpse into the mind of the arch-conservative Christian of the late 1970s.
1,do not be deceived,"I was involved in the same cult that Peter Marshall Jr. and David Manuel were resident, where they wrote this book under duress and ""discipline"" by the cults' leaders. Is it any wonder that it would be inaccurate, when someone is under corrupt authority. James 3:1 states; Dear brothers and sisters, not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged by God with greater strictness. - Be careful what you believe. And especially what you teach to others. -"
5,Outstanding!,"This book blends a keen insight into the unknown (and untold) stories of America's past with a sense of God's divine will in guiding those events. It is an excellent source of American history and it confirms what many of us already knew, God did have a plan for America when He guided our founders here. This book also shows our many stumblings and mistakes along the way and whether they produced repentence or led to further confusion. I would recommend this book to ANY serious student of American history."
3,Read . . . but be objective,"Well written. This is very dense reading, but I was so involved that it took me little over two weeks to complete. I agree with the below reviewer that the authors' standpoint is decidedly biased . . . to the point of overlooking certain glaring facts which would all but termenate their position. Does the Lord have a divine plan for the United States? Are we really ""one nation under God""? We are only under God insomuch that each individual decides to be under him. He has a plan for every person, in every place, but in a free land, we may serve Him and fulfill His dream for us more so than perhaps if we were not granted freedom of religion. I was very enlightened by the influence that religion had on Colonial Americans. I observe that secular historians ignore God's hand on our nations history, and, ultimately, it's destiny."
5,Great book for all Americans to read,"Great book. Wish school classrooms would use as a text book. Amazing ""little"" facts of our history. Every American should read."
1,The Light and The Glory,"This book starts out by the authors telling how they came to write the book. It is from a christian view point in that it points out that Columbus felt it was God calling him to sail the seas for His glory.It does not read like a boring text with just names and dates.It goes into detail about Columbus, and reads like a story book. Its tells you the names of people and why they may have done what they did. Whenever it can it will have actually writing of the person they arewriting about. If you want to read history toyour kids so they will want to learn and so they can remember more than places and dates this is book for you. It will inspire you to dig deeper."
5,New Look at the Facts,"The writers do an admirable job of going back to original source documents and giving them an objective interpretation. The original text allows the reader to validate Marshall & Manuel's thesis. I was amazed at the clarity of the original documents. From these documents you'll be certain that America was founded by Christians, using a Christ-like pattern for society. The fictional scenes and dialogue make it a lively read ... and far more faithful to the facts than some of the made-for-TV history that's been produced.This is an enjoyable and informative read. Every Christian and every American will benefit from this book. The only faith requirement to reading (and enjoying) this book is to believe that ""God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes."" (Dan 5:21)Thank you, Mr. Marshall and Manuel! I've benefited spiritually and intellectually by this book."
4,Another wonderful venoms film,"This is another in a long line of collaborations between the venoms and Chang Cheh. It is not there best (I think that would be Crippled Avengers), but it is highly entertaining. It has a storyline that has been used countless times in Shaw Brothers movies :the destruction of Shaolin Temple by the Ching and Wutang and the escape of Hung Si Quan.( I apologize for the incorrect spelling.) Even the actors give performances that they have used before in other films. So everything in it is familiar but it is not stale. The fight scenes are frequent and captivating. A film that should be in any kung fu film fan's library."
4,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","The choreography, and cinimatography absolutely awesome!!There is no question this is another 5 star performace from the vemom crew, however, I give it 4 stars for being too predictable, needless to say simply amazing!! However, like I've expressed in previous venom flicks,,you see one, and you see them all,,the story lines are usually alone the same line,,the bad guys are usually the same, the good guys are usually best friends,,who ends up dying in the end,,,,,,,,,,,kinda like knowing your A B C's,,,,a bit too elementric and mundane,,but entertaining!!"
3,Venoms fan,"Not one of the venoms best movies;however, if u r a venom fan then u must add it to ur collection"
5,Christmas,Another addition to my collection of Mathis Christmas recordings. Christmas is not Christmas unless I can listen to my Johnny Mathis recordings.
2,Good Mirror if you don't require a lot of light,"I purchased this item for my mother. She needed the 7X and obviously she needed it to be lit well. She loved the optical quality of the 7x mirror, but there was not nearly enough light for for her to be able to see what she was doing. I ended up having to return the mirror."
1,This thing is possessed!,"Like a previous reviewer said, it goes on and off at-will, not only when you're sitting there trying to put on your makeup, but all night long as well. I'm highly disappointed that I wasted $40 on this terrible mirror. In fact, I'll probably take it out on Homedics in general and never buy one of their products again."
2,Almost wonderful...,"This was a gift. Reading the box I was so excited to have a mirror where I'd be able to see what I was doing and have an attractive mirror. However, the base is extremely sensitive so it's very easy to turn the mirror off while using it. The most disappointing aspect is the low wattage of the light. If someone is purchasing this type of mirror they obviously NEED the light. If you are fortunate enough to have plenty of sunlight available then the large diameter and 7x magnification is great. But taking make-up off at night is nearly impossible. I'll be returning it soon."
1,HoMedics Makeup Mirror,Mirror has a neat feature so when you touch the base the light comes on and touched again it gets brighter. Problem is that the light never gets bright enough to do any good. Pretty much like candlelight. What was the manufacturer thinking?
3,disappointed,"I had high hopes for this soap, as it's highly thought of in reviews as well as traditional-shaving websites. The smell of the soap technically is ""limes"" but is more accurate to the rind of a key lime, which might not be expected. I also found over time it basically smelled like Dove soap to me. Not that it's a bad thing, just not the refreshing ""lime"" smell I was hoping for.The soap was okay, ok slip, ok lather... but didn't ring my bell. Paid it forward to a friend who liked it a bit more than I did, but also wasn't blown away.Maybe I just got a bad bar? For the price and the brand recognition, I'm guessing they have pretty fair quality control and bad bars are rare.Probably won't be trying a Trumper's soap again, and if I do, probably won't be Limes."
2,"Great seller, dissappointing product","The seller was great, prompt shipping and all, but this shaving soap is mediocre at best, and the scent is very mild. No better than soaps 1/2 or 1/3 the price."
3,cool loungy album,"Linda Lawson originally started out in Las Vegas singing for two years before she was able to make this album in 1960. This album is wonderfully arranged by Marty Paich and it's not hard to see why the original album is a collector's item.The loungy album is mostly full of standards like You Don't Know what Love Is and But Beautiful. The best number on the set is Like Young which takes the beatnik craze for all it was, even throwing in Kerouac's name. I love the up tempo ""Up pops Love"" just as much.Afterwards Linda Lawson put her music career aside for a film one, which resulted in her role as the mysterious mermaid in the noir thriller Night Tide. She brought an alluring charisma to the screen as well. But her name was seldom heard again. Despite that she briefly gave the entertainment industry a great star."
1,western -south basic english review 7th edition,where is another answer tryout execises more application score summary following this book before pass test. i readed this book few report tryout execises for application score summary. would you give me that another more answer following important! thanks then
1,Tracey should stick to acting...,"I have read just about every eating disorder book that comes along, and I must say that Gold's personal narrative was truly a disappointment.Ms.Gold is a decent actress, but I found her book to be quite dull and poorly written.Fortunately there are many other books available on eating disorders - and I'd be hard-pressed to find one that was more boring than this one."
2,Slowed down version of Rap Phenomenon,If you like slow music or just something diffrent from the norm check it out. But if you have rap pheomenon just play it slow and you'll have this CD.
4,My comments as an avid fan,"I read this book as soon as I could find it. It's the first book in the third series of Young Jedi Knights. (If you haven't read any others of these, find Heirs to the Force, the first book.) I was disapointed in this book. The series seems to have lost the adventures between the main characters. The bad guys aren't as interesting as at the beginning of the series. The new enemies, as far as I can gather, are remnants of the Black Sun. I like the use of old Star Wars characters (Kyp, Streen, Gallandro). I won't complain too much. Even though I didn't like some things, I'll read the next two books; the series is still better than average."
3,"I hate to burst your bubble, but this book is a bummer.","Basiclly, this book was night quite what it was made up to be. It was pretty boring, and kindof confusing. But, it you must read it, okay."
1,What a bunch of crap!,"And I loved these books. I can't believe what a cool author anderson is, and how desperate he must have been to write this book. It has to be the dumbest book on the face of this planet, oh my god!! Whatever happened to the cool authors, like Timothy Zahn, who don't give a damn when a book is due, and makes it Awesome. To hell with this book!"
4,Pretty Good,"I really liked this book, it was one of the best. There was one thing I didn't like how the relationships between Jacen and Tenel Ka and Jaina and Zeek were ignored."
3,Could Be Better,The rest of the series is really awesome but since the lately its been more about Jaina/Zekk and Jason/Tenel Ka's infatuations with each other. It'd be better if they just had more of the action than the mushy falling in love stuff. It is science fiction after all.
1,One Star,"This was not a good start to a new trilogy and the other two books that followed were sub-par compared to the previous Young Jedi Knight books. Something felt off I don't know if it was the writing, the plot, or even the charactors but it just didn't flow as well as the previous books."
2,Adequate,"Han's past catches up with him and puts Han and his children in a dangerous situation.This book is too short for the story in it to be properly fleshed out, which leaves the minor characters flat and unrealistic and the climax, because it hinges on those characters, is abbreviated and completely unbelievable.The writing is adequate and the first half of the story is more entertaining. Definitely will not read again."
3,"Pretty good, but not Anderson's best...","YJK RULE!!!!!!! RtOM was pretty good, but not the best of the series. The Jaina/Zekk and Jacen/Tenal Ka things were ignored which didn't help the book any."
5,Excellent Music and Recording,"It is a better recording than other classical music CD's I've had, and is an impeccable execution of Bach's work. It led me to buy other ""Mad About"" series CD's of which I'll comment elsewhere. ""Mad About Bach"" is a fabulous CD of which I never tire. It is motivating. I have been listening to this ""Mad About Bach"" CD music for 8 years and still love it as one of my favorites."
4,A fun whodunnit!,"I disagree with the reader who said this delightful mystery was ""easy to figure out"". Maybe I'm slow but I found the novel full of fun twists and turns in the life and events of suburban mom-turned sleuth, Jane Jeffrey. The events are set around Christmas so it's fun reading during the holidays (or at any time of year). Jane makes a very human protagonist and one is amazed at her ability to juggle a house of three kids, two cats, one dog, a best friend/neighbor, budding romance with the local police detective, solve two murders, and knit a Christmas afghan all at the same time. Sit back with a warm cup of cocoa and enjoy a delightful book!"
5,This is the first book from this author I have read.,"I loved this book!! It was a fun read and went fast with a twist at the end. It held my interest and I enjoyed it alot. I loved the relationship with Shelley and Jane. I have a friend like that, and it would be a riot to try to solve mysteries together!!"
3,"All right, I guess","I dislike reading books about fictional worlds filled with rude children, smart-mouthed adults, and mysteries that turn on the wildest coincidences.I felt Jane was cruel in her thoughts toward her guest, if not in her actions, and it made me dislike her even before the unpleasant second guest made all Jane's angst more understandable."
2,not for city girl,the seriesd is excellent for moms who live in suburbia with children;well written mysery;howeverunless you are in that category difficult to relate to.
5,Awesome Book,Excellent DVD authoring guide for DVD authors and non-authors. Simple to follow guides and diagrams. The key to the book is it's simplicity. Easy to follow instructions plus all the technical DVD stuff that you may need for reference in the future. Also the enclosed DVD is packed with goodies and extras. We also get to see Bruce explaining things to us on camera. Buy this book!!!
2,Content good - DVD USELESS,"Luckily I bought this book used and paid very little for it.The content of the book is good and I keep it on the shelf as reference, it's nice to be able to look up specific topics and the sections are usually short and to the point.My major complaint is that the much touted DVD that comes with the book is, for all intents and purposes, USELESS. In the book he references a file or where that file is on the DVD... and there is no such file or folder on the DVD. After my third attempt at looking for a file I realized this and had I not paid so little for the book I would have returned it instantly.As I said, the content seems good but the disk makes you crazy and neither the author's website nor the publisher's make any attempt to apologize for this or give you the option to acquire the files on-line. I would only purchase this book used if at all."
5,Interesting psychological wandering,"Ultimately, we can never know what goes on in another's mind, but psychologist and author Bond does a lyrical job of imagining the inner workings of one of the best singers in history. She's not a musician reviewing Callas' musical life, but a therapist imagining her inner life - and it's a good read that I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Awful Crap,"This is the worst that could have happened to the already excessive iconography on Callas. After all the lies, misperceptions and inaccuracies that have been said about her we do not need this pseudo-whatever-genre of ""psychoanalytical"" insight into Callas mind. Additionally, the book is full of mistakes (for example, the reference to Evangelia Callas as ""Liska"" instead of ""Litsa"" and so on). The book is also plagued of typos. This book is just awful. If somebody isinterested in Callas' life it would be better to read Ardoin and Fitzgerald's book (unfortunately out of print) or Stelios Galatopoulos and Michael Scott's biographies."
1,Garbage!,"This book is a pathetic, mercenary attmept by the ""author"" to capitalize on the Callas story. It is a completely frustrating, dreadful read. Inaccuracies and misspellings abound. Trust the previous reviewer above and SAVE A TREE by not buying this book. I own dozens of books on Callas, including the definitive works by Ardoin, Fitzgerald, and Wisneski, so please take my advice and avoid this awful book. I wish I had seen the reviews here before I wasted my money."
1,SAVE A TREE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"I love her voice and sytle, however this psysobable is intolerable. I had to stop reading and listen to her sing just to regain my sanity. Sorry to say but stay away far far away"
1,Awful Crap,"This is the worst that could have happened to the already excessive iconography on Callas. After all the lies, misperceptions and inaccuracies that have been said about her we do not need this pseudo-whatever-genre of ""psychoanalytical"" insight into Callas mind. Additionally, the book is full of mistakes (for example, the reference to Evangelia Callas as ""Liska"" instead of ""Litsa"" and so on). The book is also plagued of typos. Why on earth trees have to be cut in order to produce the paper for this kind of crap? This book is just awful crap. If somebody is interested in Callas' life it would be better to read Ardoin and Fitzgerald's book (unfortunately out of print), Stelios Galatopoulos or Michael Scott's biographies."
5,A blessing in disguise!!,"When I ordered this book I truly did not know to what extent it would help me but it has helped volumes! This book looks at why people use SIV (Self inflicted Violence) and also helps you learn why you or others may use it and how to stop it. ""Scarred Soul,"" has opened up my eyes and my mind in so many new ways. With the frequency of SIV now a days this is an important book for everyone to have to help understand but especially helpful for the users of SIV. To me this book is priceless!"
5,This is THE book to choose out of the several available,"This book is appropriate for teens and adult. It is sensitively and sensibly written, and instead of just being a research or story book, it is loaded with insights, worksheet activities, and relevant anecdotes. It also includes information that is usually overlooked in other books: how to talk to loved ones about self-injury, what therapists and parents should know, how to explain the behavior to people who don't understand, and how to cope with triggers."
1,Not For Everyone,"I am a cutter. People should know that this book cannot be the only thing that helps them stop their behavior. A behavior that is so much a part of them can only be changed through counseling, love, support, and the actual desire to change. This help might be an EXTRA help in ADDITION TO therapy for some people, but for most, this is a load of bull. Another thing is that this book and therapy and stuff is only going to work on someone who is ready to stop their behavior. This book should have been more about comforting and supporting self-injurers instead of judging them for a behavior they cannot help. I don't see what is wrong with injuring yourself in order to feel calmer and happier. Even if you do want to stop cutting, this book is no where NEAR the amount of help a person needs to stop a behavior so necassary to their very survival. What a self-injurer needs is a trained and licensed proffessional, not some book they found in the bargain bin."
5,an essential book on this topic,"If you self-injure or are trying to understand someone who does, you need to get this book. It is humane, compassionate, understanding, and wise, and it gives you concrete exercises that will help you understand where your self-harm comes from and how to find other ways of coping with overwhelming feelings."
4,"""Classic Fantasy!""","Noah Hathaway and Barret Oliver star in Wolfgang Petersen's1984 fantasy. A boy reads and becomes part of a magicalstorybook filled with adventure. I grew up watching thisclassic and always loved it and Klaus Doldinger andGeorgio Moroder's score is excellent. This dvd hasgood picture and sound, but only a trailer.I recommend this."
5,Hit of grandaughter's 8th birthday!!!,"What a joyous event these Heely's made for Amy. She can really ""whiz along with these well-made skates. Thanks Amazon and this wonderful Heely's product. She really is enjoying her Heely's.A Very Grateful Grandma & Grandaughter"
1,poor quality,The technical side of the cd production was awful. Breaks were placed in the recording which completely ruined the nature of the symphony.Not recommended.
5,Karajan's magic in Strauss' Alpine Sinfonie,"This is really a great performance by Herbert Von Karajan and the Berliner Philharmoniker. One nice detail I would like to refer to. At the end, just before the roaring sound, wich also started the Symphony, returns, in fact this sound symbolises the huge mountain standing there somewhere in the dark, you actually hear the Berliner Philharmoniker play the very last ray of sunlight before the night sets in. It is done by one oh so sensible swiftly stroke on the strings. Gosh, how great this all is. Karajan and the Berliner at their best.It is also very interesting to listen to Richard Strauss' own conducting of this his own work, as produced by Preiser Records from Austria or Music and Arts Program of America.Yours,Gert"
5,"Great tweezers, great service","The product got lost in shipment and the seller was very quick in responding and sending a replacement. The tweezers have arrived today and I must say-I was very curious as to what a $20 pair of tweezers can do. Well, now I know. These are fantastic. They are very sharp and make it easy to pluck even the finest, thinnest hair. Very smooth product!"
5,"Once again, Tananarive Due delivers!","My only question is 'will there be a sequel to this sequel?'In Fana, Jessica, & Dawit the author has created a believable family of immortals encountering unbelievable circumstances.I do like the way Ms. Due juxtaposes basic simple Christian beliefs with so-called new-age concepts i.e. what are the possibilities when we truly grasp thought control?...what are the perils when we don't?There simply MUST be a follow-up book. Having been a phenomenally-gifted toddler who survived many dangers how will Fana handle her gifts as an adolescent? Will Jessica 's own Christian upbringing be enough to ground Fana as she comes to terms with just how different she is from the rest of humanity?I enjoy imagining their lives to come but I really want Tananarive Due to go forward with her own possibilities...since she knows these characters better than anyone else---except the characters themselves.a real page turner...makes 1 ponder the wonder of it all."
5,Fantastic Book,"What an exciting and unique thriller, I enjoyed this book!! It was well written and very creative. It had me on the edge of my seat. George Kallas, LMHC"
5,Truly entertaining,This is a great book. Take it from a bibliophile who buys but doesn't read half the books he owns. I read this one in three days. It was truly entertaining and I'm still waiting to see how the movie works out(My Soul To Keep). This is a very talented writer.
3,"One word, wordy","I have one word for this book, wordy! It could have been 300 pages, instead of the 700 it was. Due goes into all kinds of lengthy explanations of feelings and emotions that are just so much blah, blah, blah. The story kept promising to get interesting but never really did, and the ending was down right hokey. I read reveiw after reveiw that said this book was really scary......NOT! It was scary diappointing."
3,Blood Money!,"I dove into ""The Living Blood"" on a whim, expecting to find yet another take on the vampire genre...but ready for someone other than Anne Rice to read. I'm ecstatic that I came across Tananarive Due's book!Not quite a true vampire story, yet having all the thrilling elements, ""The Living Blood"" barrels along nicely, combining awesome and well-developed characters, and a brilliant plot. Due's writing manage's to be poetic, emotionally deep, and intriguing all at once."
4,The Living Blood - a can't put down reading selection,"The Living Blood is a totally captivating, action filled, mind provoking text from start to finish. Ms. Due made me ponder the question ""Are there really immortals among us""? I was literally trasported to the Africa, then to Florida as the action continued. I felt the pain and the rift of guilty conscience that Fana felt and I was horrified when David was burned alive. I was not ready for the book to end and that was the only thing that displeased me."
4,Bigger is not always better!,"The continuation of a storyline begun in ""My Soul to Keep"" is intriguing but takes too long in story development, seeming somewhat derivative of other works (William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist"" comes to mind). Like an overproduced album, Miss Due's tale of immortality doesn't ""live"" up to expectations shown in the first installment. That is not to say that it's not a good read; it's just not as fulfilling."
4,Spellbinding Story,"Well - I got 3 hours of sleep last night because I started reading this book after work yesterday. I was captivated by the imagery...this continuation of ""My Soul to Keep"" did not disappoint. This story could strech on for 36 volumes like Nancy Drew Mysteries and I'd lose sleep to read every one!I loved Fana aka Bee Bee - this little witch was so well developed I felt like she was a confused member of my own family.And the perspective changed in this novel - in My Soul to Keep Teferi was described as this utter fool, upon ""meeting"" his character I grew to understand and respect him..."
3,"Lightweight, but not a disaster","I may be misunderstanding the previous reviewer (CR), but the way to look up a word in a dictionary is to turn to the letter and page that contains the term. It would be very odd for a dictionary to be separately indexed as that reviewer suggests it should be. That said, this particular dictionary is a lightweight among legal dictionaries. If you want a Webster's legal dictionary, the earlier Webster's Dictionary of Law is better."
1,This is crazy,"Good luck trying to use this reference. Who ever heard of a dictionary where you can't look up a term? This dictionary is not indexed in any way. So let's suppose you want to look up the definition of the word ""contract."" The only way to find it is to go page by page from ""AAA"" to ""Contract"" OR guess that the ""c's "" might be 20% into the dictionary and jump to that location OR use the Kindle search feature which will return 349 places in the text where the word ""contract"" is used-- 348 of them will not be the definition."
2,D Stacey,doesnt have enough power to kill the bugs it only makes them swarm around it.But a electric bug zapper.
1,bug zapper,the bug zapper is really small I should have known by the dimensions. It took about 5 to 7 days to charge the solar lights. I have yet to hear it zap any bugs and also there is no proof that it has zapped any bugs. Even though the days day been sunny there are many nights the bug zapper is not lite. I have solar bird feeders that light up every night all year long.
3,Segway,"I think this is a great product. Yesterday I saw a man at the picnic day at UCDavis riding one with ease. They are a bit to over priced though. They would be great for college if you don't like bikes. And you can get attachments to carry all your books in. Plus, to carge it you just plug it into a regular outlet."
3,a hollistic approach ...,"Designing the green skyscrapter do not begin with 1 : 100 scale drawing. But we have to consider all the environmental factors that affect the building.I think that's the reason why this book contains basic theory of green building, environmental aspects that become an important factor in designing green skyscrapter rather than the skyscrapter itself.In this book Yeang convincingly described in a hollistic approach, from the basic theory with doubtless reason, the environmental factors and its application in the building with example of his Tokyo-Nara building.Indeed, this is not an 'easy reading' book. But understanding all the factors is important, not only about the separate issue to ensure the main goal, designing 'true' green skyscrapter as Yeang explained here.After all, this book is a valuabe resources for those who interest in this field."
3,Dried blueberries,"This product is ok for dried fruit. I use it as snack while working at my desk. However, the fruit is very small. I suppose it's suppose to be very small. Otherwise, it's a nice way to have a snack while getting all the benefits it offers. Susan from Atlanta"
4,Great taste and no added sugar!,"I was buying the Trader Joe's dried blueberries until I saw that they add sugar. I found these and use them for salads, cereal and yogurts. Perfect!"
2,Kleins is not Natural anymore,"Kleins was pretty much the only brand that did not add sugar fructose or other additives to their blueberries. Sugar content was low and quality and flavor were high. Now however, the latest batch of berries has come back into stock with corn syrup and tons of sugar. This is a shame. Now they're no different than any other blueberry brand."
2,Disappointed,"As others have noted, I was disappointed by the addition of corn syrup(high fructose?). The blueberries are tasty. I add them to cereal and just mixed some into a chicken salad. I'll enjoy what I bought, but won't buy them again. Too bad."
3,New Female Gangsta,"Twenty-two-year-old Philadelphian Ms. Jade is closely associated with Timbaland, who produced nine tracks on her debut record, Girl Interrupted, and put it out on his Beat Club label, which is affiliated with Interscope. Ms. Jade definitely benefits from Timbaland's signature, laid-back beats. She also has plenty of rap's heavy-hitters making appearances, including Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, and Nate Dogg. Ms. Jade doesn't get nasty à la Lil' Kim or Foxy Brown, and thanks to Timbaland's skills, there are some good songs here, including ""Really Don't Want My Love,"" where Ms. Jade sounds inspired when tearing up an ex-boyfriend, ""Big Head,"" a fun, danceable tune with a silly chorus, and ""Dead Wrong,"" where Nate Dogg steals the spotlight as usual with his soulful vocals, which seem to make for instant radio hits."
3,3.75 stars and I'm being generous,"Ms Jade can rap sometimes. What ruins her music are these dumb choruses (IE track ""BIG HEAD"" : ""get your big head on the floor; you ain't ever seen me move like this""). That is the stupidest chorus I've ever heard in my entire life and I don't need a concussion. Then on ""Ching Ching"" it is so annoying having Nelly Furtado in the background mumbling ""Ching Ching"" along with some other gibberish throughout the whole song. Those are probably the 2 worst songs on the album."
3,could have been alot better,"i really expected this CD to be a great CD with some crazy beats by timbaland. it seems like him and the neptuens are the only ones that come out with original beats anymore. But this CD is only a little past mediocre. I mean she's got good wordflow, but nothing any better than your average eve. With ""big head"" spinning like crazy on BET this summer, and that wacky, if not minimalist but somehow catchy beat, youd think the rest of the CD is like it. but i cant tell the difference between that and any other rap CD. Ching Ching looks like it could be a big single, with Nelly Furtado's vocals serving as the beat. if your a timbaland fan get it, and get the CD for the few good songs."
3,Some songs are okay,"I like some of ms jade's music. The verse in her songs are tight but her choruses make no sense like ""Get you big head on the floor"". I guess that is supposed to mean to dance. Who uses their head to dance? Maybe a foot or 2."
4,Experimental Methods for engineering,because its a text book and my daughter has to take the class she says the class is good Thanks
5,Good product,"Although this book has not been critical to my current class, it was shipped on time, and well packaged by Amazon."
2,No baby Lindbergh kidnapping book seems objective...,"Fisher is as guilty of the same sins he's accusing other authors of: lack of objectivity. This book builds on the author's previous book but continues with the same paradigm right from the beginning - that Hauptman acted by himself and was guilty of the crime.This particular book would be understood by those who have read the basics of the Lindbergh case. It analyses the various theories developed through time in terms of who committed the crime. He rejects every single theory but, at times, the arguments to do so are full of logical fallacies, such as ""such and such could have never happened because if it had then too many people would have sworn to a lie"". This type of rebuttal is hardly convincing.Overall, the book is of interest to those who have become serious followers of the case and would like to have a complete bookcase on what has been written about it. Otherwise, it is of relatively low merit."
3,Unnecessary Rebuttal,"Fisher's first book was clearly a better work. This second book appears to be nothing more than Fisher's response to his many critics. It is very brief with only a thumbnail sketch of the case. I think this would have been better as a magazine article than a full book.Additionally, Fisher makes some Herculean leaps in logic. The finding of a bottle of Ether produced after the date of the kidnapping, i.e. March 1, 1932, forms the basis of a claim by Fisher that Hauptmann was planning to kidnap again. The leap is just too great.To his credit, Fisher does debunk many of the great fallacies of this case, especially concerning the ladder and wood evidence. Nevertheless, I think this book was unnecessary and Fisher should have just let his first book do the talking for him."
1,Goodness,"Uninspiring, mean-spirited rehash of the official New Jersey State Police line. Useful for those who would like to know how the police wish the case (and their conduct) to be viewed, but slightly hysterical. No new evidence to speak of, either."
4,Revising the revisionist history of the Hauptmann trial,Jim knows the truth and how to tell it. This book will finally but guilt were it belongs and let that poor child rest in peace.
2,A very small bit.,This is a very tiny piece of putty. It is barely enough to be useful. The medium stiffness is pretty soft.
1,Wrong Item - GUTTED!!!!!,"Heat Guy J is one of my many favourite animes, and I recently ordered this CD soundtrack. However, when I received the item, I was shocked to find out that they sent me an original DRAMA soundtrack!!I did not ask for a drama soundtrack! I wanted the music soundtrack. Now I'm worried that if I re-order the CD, they'll send me the wrong item again.Watch out for silly mistakes. I had high expectations of Amazon, and I did not expect a silly mistake like this!"
3,Cute but overpriced,"I purchased this item as a gift for a friend. It came right away & in good condition. It is a really cute little crock with everything needed to grow herbs. Since I gave it as a gift, I do not know how well the herbs actually grow. However the item can be purchased for only $9.95 from Lakeside Collection. When I saw their ad, I purchased one that grows strawberries from them. Exact same item except for the difference in seeds."
2,fine but broken,the product was never used and returned. never had the chance to plant because the pot arrived broken and was returned. the best thing is that we got our money back. the worst thing was the packing by the shipper which no doubt cased the damage. the product could not be exchanged and left us short of an already late Christmas present.
2,Bottoms Out!,"A rather dinky little mute, and would be suitable for students, but unfortunately the sound becomes uncontrolable with this mute from low C downwards.David Hooke"
4,Classic Houston Rap,"The MTV folks and people who have been promoting Houston rap really dont know anything about Houston rap. This is it right here along with ESG Ocean of Funk and Three in tha Mornin'. The DJ screw that is laced through this album is perfect and the old school street flava host cameo is only known by us H-towners. Depite all of that, there is no way someone should be selling this for $70."
5,Screwston,"Who ever priced this Item is on something else. If you From Screwston, TX. you'll understand."
1,Wont hold plug,"This is an absolutely horrible product. It was easy enough to wire up the lines. But the receptacles will not hold a standard RJ-11 plug. If I push the plug in, I can get a dial tone, but when I let go of the plug, it just falls out."
2,Weak,"I found the songs on this album weak and non-melodic. They sound like songs a 14-year-old would write. In other words, immature, with occasionally a good melody bursting out."
5,Yummy Organic Snacks!,"This is one of my all time favorite snack foods. Some of the ingredients are organic, and it is all natural. Even junk food people will like this item. I recommend ordering the ""mixed sampler"" Five Pack of 2 ounce packages, which has every flavor. My favorite is the pistachio and the macadamia nut flavors. There is a big bargain offer if you order it on a regular basis - you can have a box delivered every month, once every two months, etc. The discount is considerable - I forget the exact details, but it saves you about 25%, plus FREE SHIPPING on the super saver program.It is very lightly sweetened with organic sugar - I am not much for candy and I like that it is not TOO sweet, just lightly sweetened. Nice combination of exotic fruits, nuts, spices - there is nothing else like it on the market!"
5,Delicous!,Only 4 of the 5 flavors are gluten free but I love all of those. I understand the 5th flavor (which I can't eat) is very good as well. I definitely give these a thumbs up!
4,Interesting flavors and good,While these snacks aren't cheap they are good and better for you than some of the other choices out there. I liked the variety pack it was a chance to sample the larger part of their selection rather than buying a big bag of one kind and finding out you don't like it. My favorite is the Vladosta pecans and cranberries with the black pepper.
3,"Unique tasting, but expensive","Most of the flavors taste good, but it's kinda expensive for how much you get in one pack. It's a good snack to have around during the day at work. If they were cheaper I would fully recommend them."
1,Unintelligible,"The sound for this toy is so bad as to renderit useless I. Regrettably, I had to return itand eat the postage. Nice concept for a toy, butunintelligible audio is not acceptable in a teachingtoy!"
5,good product,this product is great but i bought the wrong size so im returing it. i have the same brand but the correct size and it works wonders. WAY better then then the hang on back filters
5,great,First seen this butter girl girl over at a friends house and thought it was so neat that i came home and order one for each of my kids.......it is so neat to butter corn now....we just love it....and you could use it on lots other things too........
3,looks good but....,"It's too short for a whole stick of butter, it does what it's intended for buttering your corn and if it was big enough to hold a whole stick of butter I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Dorien Kelly is a great new author!,"The contemporary romance market will definitely welcome newcomer Dorien Kelly. In fact, she's bound to become a favorite with readers in no time at all. Her characters are lively and believable - her storyline is well thought out and her unique, well-honed voice displays evidence of the dedication she's undoubtedly made to perfecting her craft. If I had three thumbs, I'd give her three-thumbs-up, but since I only have two -- two will have to do. I look forward to reading more titles from her!"
2,lower expectations,"I found a reference to this book in the Sweet Potatoe Queens book (hilarious!). I thought this Primer would likewise be funny. Not so. It simply explained all the fluff that southern ladies went through back in the 60's and perhaps still do to some extent. Pretty boring stuff, just explanations of excesses."
4,Cute and funny,"I agree with the above reviewer in that this book is just like the first book. It only changes a couple of things, like adding a few comments about Paris Hilton. I do wish it had been a little more up-to-date but it is still a great read."
2,Southern Belle Primer,Not really what I expected. It is a copy of Southern Belle Primer: Why Princess Margaret Will Never Be a Kappa Kappa Gamma.
5,How do you choose..,..the best of the Fenians....with so much wonderful music to choose from.. what's great about this collection is the many Fenian originals written by members of the band. The CD covers about 14 years of music. I have the joy of hearing this band live frequently and Galway Girl is a hit at every gig and concert... Enjoy!!!
3,"Enjoyable, but . . .","I find the music enjoyable, but nothing special. There is no loss buying this CD, but I'm sure there are others, perhaps, that are better."
3,While vacationing in France,"Sydney Sloan and her lover Leslie visit Sydney's niece Vickie in France, only to find that Vickie is married, the husband's parents were murdered, and the husband is missing. Sydney of course becomes embroiled in finding Vickie's husband, and soon finds her own life in danger. The mystery-thriller elements of the story are rather great, but my disappointment lies with the nonexistent background details of France. If this were a movie, it would've been filmed on a Hollywood backdrop, far from France. And the explanations often come far after the reader has been asking questions, so it's a tad frustrating. Lordon's ""East Of Niece"" is a pretty good mystery, but it certainly doesn't stand out in a crowd."
3,Not Technical Enough,"This program was not technical enough for me. It does not reveal most of the technology used in the building of the planes. I expected to come out after watching this program having more knowledge about jet engines, aerodynamics, flight instruments, etc., but what I got instead was a story about the competition between two aviation giants struggling to build an all-in-one fighter plane for the US government. The challenge was to build a plane that can take off and land vertically, fly supersonically and above all cost reasonably low.I give this program 3 stars instead of 1 because of the nice footage of the planes in action, even though there were little. I liked the vertical take off tests and the flames coming out of the exhaust nozzle during supersonic tests."
2,Not Objective Comparison between two company,I did watch that and I did not liked cause I know good detailed information about this history. This DVD is making polishing Boeing company instead Lockheed won this techonology war ! It is 2 hours long and Boeing appears most of the times. There is no good explanation how Lockheed is performed that outstanding job. It all talkes about Boeing and at the final it again declares Boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs. I think the director was from Boeing Company
1,Tight Fit for Sony AR Series Notebooks,"Caution, bought this case for my Sony Vaio AR630e 17"" Notebook (one of the models it's suppose to be compatitble with) and it is a really tight fit. Yes it is possible to cram the notebook into the case with lots of pulling, tugging and stretching, but there is the fear of damaging or scratching the notebook. If possible, try the case first with your notebook. I would not buy site unseen. Finally, if you are in my position with this case already in hand and experiencing a tight fit with your Sony 17"" Vaio, try placing your notebook into the case with the front down (toward the back of the case) as I find it fits much better. Funny how most of the people who give this case positive reviews, buy it for notebooks other than Sony Vaio(s)."
1,Good quality but...,"This case is good looking with good quality, but it is for anything else but 17-inch laptop! My AZ-series VAIO fits very very very hard in the case.I would send in back, but all ready gave it to a friend with 15-inch Acer.I would not recommend it for 17-inch VAIO!!!"
1,they sent me the wrong cover,"I bought a 13"" and they sent a 17"", very bad cause i live in brazil, and there is no way to retorn it!"
4,A cute toy box,"We bought this toy box after purchasing the table set from this line for my daughters play room. It is was pretty simple to put together and it has a safety hinge so your little one can't close their fingers inside.My only complaint wuld be that the drawer underneath doesnt have any type of catch or latch to stop it from being fully pulled out, so my daughter who is a toddler always pulls it all the way out trying to get her toys from inside and then can not get it back on the track to push it back in."
3,"Very Cute, but small","I purchased this for my 1 year old daughter, because it matched the colors in her room. It is very cute and easy to put together, but very small for the price."
3,a bit small,The chest is smaller than I thought it would be. A few pieces came broken but the compnay replaced them.... It is ok for a few toys but if you need space this is NOT the chest for you
3,Prices too high,The box sets used to go on sale for $16-20... now they rarely get under $30... plus they practically halved the number of episodes per boxed set even though we are paying more money per each set. Disappointed with both amazon and Viz. Going to spend my money elsewhere.
2,So-so Naruto,"My bf and i were really excited when this box set came in the mail, as we always are with the new Naruto Shippuden sets, but this set was disappointing. It was mostly filler, and not even very interesting filler, at that. The newest of Orochimaru's henchmen aren't that interesting, and their jutsu aren't very impressive. Although we will continue to buy these for the collection, we really hope the plot line improves."
2,Naruto is always Good but...,"Please note this rating has nothing to do with the company who shipped this. A 5 goes to the company who shipped this out to me, thanks again.As for the DVD itself as any Naruto it's excellent, but on a major downside extremely slow progressing. I was disappointed this volume was left on a cliff hanger. As far as Naruto Shippuden goes, at least 3 volumes have to be sold together for a cheaper price. Naruto going to the hot spring, Naruto eating food with friends, or silly arguments that cut down on the serious parts just waists so much time and makes it very annoying."
1,Moen Pure Faucet Filter Replacement Microtech 5000/5001,"I would not purchase this Moen product again. After reaching out to Moen, I learned that this product has been discontinued by Moen. Therefore, where ever you purchase this product, you will be purchasing old stock, and most likely a dried out charcoal filter that you will not be able to tell whether it is new, usable or just a throwaway. Although the product arrived sealed in plastic, there is no way to know if it is still viable.To have spent almost $50.00 for this product, was sinful. When I sent my note of dissatisfaction from the place I purchased on Amazon, I was told to call Moen. Yes, what an offer to help. Keep my $50.00 plus for an old filter. I will never purchase this item again."
2,expensive water,"The price of the filter was reasonable. However, UPS tacked on $20 COD.I basically had to pay twice as much for this filter."
4,IN-faucet filte,Typical Moen product. Works as advertised and one from Amazon is same as from appliance dealer.
5,Great price for a comfortable laptop,"Nice 15'' screen, decent RAM and Hard Drive amount, fast CPU... a great laptop at a very reasonable price. I'm coming from an Apple notebook and I'm definitely not going back."
4,Don't Overlook,This is a surprisingly well played disc for the price. Do not overlook this and other CD's on this budget label.
3,CATNIP,"After several attempts to engage my aged cat with this catnip I finally filled an old nylon stocking with it. Now that she can smell it more intensely she is quite content. I love to watch her doze off. Slowly the eyes close, then the head drops, the lips may or may not part, the tongue may or may not protrude, but always the head drops until her chin sits on her stocking filled with catnip. I think it may be equally entertaining for me.A side note: Until recent years, and still in many part of the world, people have drunk catnip tea (usually in the afternoons) for its relaxing qualities. It is a member of the mint family and quite safe. It can also be used as a mint would be used in foods."
1,cats were completely not interested,"I have 3 cats, all of whom love catnip. I bought this brand because it was supposed to be only flowers and leaves plus organic. When I gave some to my cats, they weren't interested. Each one sniffed, kind of excited because I had put it in the catnip-places... and then looked at me like ""this is it?"" I put out some of our older stuff to alleviate the disappointment and received the usual happy reaction to catnip. For whatever reason, this catnip was a dud for all three of my cats."
3,"Ok machine, Not reliable for long term ownership.","We purchased the machine and enjoyed 3 espressos a day for about 10 months. Then the coffee tapping mechanism began to malfunction. We have exchanged the machine for a replacement, I look forward to seeing how this one lasts. Has anyone found instruction manuals online?"
1,Save Your Money!,"Whomever is giving this a 5 star review must be part of the student group from UNLV that made this movie. It's terrible! I feel like I'm the one who got robbed for paying to watch this, and I'm actually fond of movies many people consider ""bad."""
1,Published by Springer,"The lesson here for me lies not in the book but the publisher. If you publish with Springer, who is ever going to read your book? At a cost of $130.+ per book? Is it any wonder no one has written a review here yet? I would purchase and read this book if it were at all affordable. To me, it's not. To a university using federal funding, maybe yes. But I do know Vygotsky himself is well worth reading if one is at all interested in the psychology of human development."
5,Bruce Lee as people knew him.,"Learn about Lee the way close friends knew him. Lots of footage of the great master in action. Also, clip of a Brandon Lee interview. Learn about his life and untimely death."
5,I have seen it...darn I can't count that high...,"This is the best movie of all time. Brandon Lee in his last role...it was his best. The Crow portrays a man emotionaly and physicaly on the verge of going mad. But in his sadness he finds justice in the form of the death of those who killed him. This is one of the saddest movies I have ever watched. I wish for all who read this to take time, buy this movie, watch it and then watch it again and again. Please watch this movie and love it as I do... ""and suddenly I heard a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door...you heard me rapping right?&quot"
4,quite good,"first off, i'm not 13. i'm in my 20s... anyway, Coco is Coco and Mariah is Mariah- they are very different! I like Coco for her unique voice and singing style. in this album, there are plenty of catchy songs, and Coco did a pretty good job. however, she still hasn't demonstrated the uniqueness that she possesses as in her mandarin albums. hopefully Coco will have a chance to release her 3rd album, something with less hip-hop influence..."
4,Very well organized,"I really like to llisten your these MAD ABOUT series. However, I could not buy these series in Japan. Please let me now how to buy these series. And tell me what kind of albums you have in stock, and how much if I need air persel. Thanks."
3,some interesting stuff. mostly shallow & redundant filler,"The first 100 pages of this book are interesting. If you are looking at theme. And how filmic language can support theme. THe authors insight into filmic technique and language is a bit obvious. but He has a nice way of looking at theme.But after that the book gets stuck in the mud and doesnt move forward. The author rehashes and fills up 200 more pages or so with about 5 more pages of new insight.I would hate to take a class from this guy.P.S. What you want to read instead is ""Making Movies""by Sidney Lumet. If I compared the two books I would give Dancyger 1 star."
1,Waste of time,I have read the first part of the book and I fin the analysis very poor. The kind of books with manay quotations and examples without the in depth analysis. This book can be summarized in probably 25 pages and you would still wonder why bothering wirting a book like that. It's a personal view that could be a blog but not a reference book. Far from it. The movie examples are sometimes to so badly understood...A definitely don't buy recommendation. I can't believe that the editor is not reading this stuff...
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is one of the worst books I have read on directing.Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time with it.It basically involves the author giving a rundown on his favourite films and if he likes the film he claims they are great directors.He rates his films according to directors being competent, good or great.If you want to learn about directing read any of Judith Weston's books or Lenore DeKoven's Changing Direction for working with actors or some of Steven Katz books for blocking and shot selection.Don't waste your time on this one.Hey Ken, how about giving me my $29.95 back!"
4,"Amazing, Intresting and joy to read","A very deatailed, yet enjoyable to read, book covering the genesys, evolution and variants of one of the most known (but least covered) aeronautical icons.If you want to find out anecdotes and war stories of one of the most devastating (in terms of firepower deployed) warbirds of WWII. Read this book"
5,Great!!!!!,I love love love this show/movie its great it shows drama and love relationships and break ups. Its about realizing who you are for the frist time in a new town.If you liked season one you will totally love seasons 2 and 3.
1,south of nowhere,"This series was recommened to me and I found it to be the biggest waste of time and money,I thought that maybe if I persisted with it it would get better man was I wrong."
2,"Great series, offensive DVD release","CONSUMER WARNING.The series is great. The DVD picture quality is also quite good, and it is nice not to have network adverts crawling across the screen.However, I cannot give a good rating to a DVD set which hacks up the original show. If you're really a fan, you will consider this to be a low-quality, defective release, and you may consider it inferior to off-air copies.The theme music has been completely replaced with a different song. This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs. The original song is, of course, much more appropriate and better.There may be other unidentified cuts and alterations, as the series used a lot of rather expensive music.The versions on Amazon Unbox and iTunes have the same cuts.The DVDs have several mastering errors; the ""choose episode"" option simply doesn't work."
3,"GREAT SERIES, CHEAPLY DISTRUBTED DVD","This series is absolutly amazing. if you have never watched it you will fall in love with the characters from episode 1. unfortunatly the dvd box set is MADE TO ORDER and DVDR which means they are burnt from a computer and put together much like a burnt copy or bootleg copy. its ashame because this series is so good and it makes it seem not much worth it. Not saying why, but I am sure they have there reasons for ending the series and not spending alot of time on the quality. Hopefully everyone enjoys the show and looks past the appearance of the box. I recommend buying it just its ashame the music is different and that the box is cheap."
5,S.O.N. Season 1 EXCELLENT,"I absolutely love this show and was quite suprised with how good the quality of the dvd was because I had only ever watched the show on the internet. The dvd was shipped and received very quickly and plays perfectly. I would most definately from this user again and I cannot wait to purchase the second season of South of Nowhere because this is a truly excellent show with an amazing message to it's viewers, I highly recommend it."
4,Good stuff,South of Nowhere is a great show and I know that the story line helps alot of teens going through the same things. I was so happy with my purchase. The item arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival time. Very happy
1,Falsifying product description,"I have always been very happy with purchases from Amazon, but this is an exception. Amazon has burned this episodes onto dvd and did not include in the product information that there would be actual edits from the original show(which I know because I taped the show when it was on the N network). There are changes in dialogue and content. This is very upsetting given the price, but most important is amazon's not being completely forth coming in it's product description. Otherwise, amazon has always been a great place to shop"
2,Boring and heavy-handed,"This has to be one of the most heavy-handed performances of these concertos that I have ever heard. The pianist periodically throws in dotted rests and rubato that aren't anywhere in the score. I suppose in order to add a ""deeply personal emotional emphasis"" to the music. Instead, it just breaks the melodic flow of these sublime pieces of music. Meanwhile, von Karajan is beating mercilessly on the orchestra in an effort to get through everything as quickly as possible -- perhaps he's bored and would rather be doing something else.The overall effect is more like a wonky version of John Philip Sousa than Schumann and Grieg. I really regret having bought this CD, but I will at least have the joy of feeding it into a shredder."
4,After Death Communication: Final Farewells Louis LaGrand purchased from Amazon.com,"I spoke by phone with the author around Thanksgiving past. She was very congenial.What caught my attention was the title of the segment, ""THE YELLOW DR. DENTON PAJAMAS."" This was the 2nd book of spirit encounters in my case, concerning contacts with spirits.This book was very good, and illustrated how rare it is to have a vision of the spirit's body, rather than the more common way of feeling a presence, a touch, or a fragrance. I was surprised at the number of unuasual electronic occurences, also common.Actually, I read this book some years ago, and Amazon.com had was a bargain rate."
2,I wasn't looking for a textbook when I read this book.,"""Final Farewells"" reminded me too much of a college textbook. Although some of its parts remain somewhat interesting, most of it is just so coldly written. There really is nothing moving about the way the author writes."
5,Great!,Thank you very much for the Item it is serving my needs very well as we read these ridiculously long required messages.
3,"I wish it has the option ""look inside""","I wish it has the option ""look inside"" to see if this is what i need, which give syou the feeling you have when you are, say at Barnes and Noble and see the book ""live"". This is a big inconvenient.. could you people in charge do this pleasE? after all, it is not an inexpensive book and we like to know what do we pay the money for.. many thanks for understanding. so at this point, i don't know how to rate this book."
3,Good overview of the campaign,"This book provides, in the usual Osprey Battles format, a nice overview of the Dardanelles campaign. There are plenty of black and white photos, as well as color drawings featuring uniforms, armament, and so on.From a modeler's point of view, you should add Osprey's THE OTTOMAN ARMY 1914-1918 for a more complete vision of the turkish army."
2,Not for use in Apologetics,"Although this book is easy reading, and gives much background about the origin of wicca, it does not put forth strong enough logical arguments to convince those in the pagan-like sects that their very souls are in mortal danger. We need a theological book refuting paganism (modern wicca and the like) and this is not it."
1,ARE YOU FOR REAL?,"I've been studying MANY RELIGIONS for several years. One, being paganism. Pagans do not believe in Satan, there for CAN NOT be satan worshipers. It's too bad that right wing bible beaters think any religion that doesn't see Christ as the savior automatically means it's a dangerous, evil religion. This author needs to grow up and not act his shoe size.Last time I turned on the T.V.:1. Priests are molesting little boys2. ""Money is the root of all evil"" so why do churches keep begging for it?"
1,Should be a zero,"It's really sad that people can't research and understand something rather than assuming it's all bad. Christians may think that Wicca and Satanism are evil merely because it's against their Bible but they're missing the point, most pagans do not follow the Bible and therefore do not want to be ""saved""."
1,Hate Speach,"In countries that embrace democracy and tolerance, this book is tantamount to Hate Speech and is an example of discrimination in its ugliest form.Its disgusting."
3,Over The Top,"I found this particular book to be quite informative and interesting but felt the Author to be extremely anxious and the short story he incorporated within the pages of comparison amongst Christianity, Wicca and Satanism unnecessary to the information being provided. The story was the Author's interpretation of an example of a religious invasion and he felt so concerned over these alternative religions that he forwarned all readers to alert friends or family members that the book was actually being read. I found the information useful but not overpowering or threatening or able to change any convictions I may already have, just a better understanding of the three different religions."
1,Just to clear things up,"I'm not a satanist, nor do I claim to be a know-all about it, but the Satanism I have encountered so far in my life have not been the worship of the Christian-based being Satan, but a worship of the self, of indulgence, and self preservation. Indeed, ALL of those I have met would not dare harm a child, like they're stereotyped to do! They value innocence - they wouldn't want to destroy it, and frown on those that do.Just to fill in a bit of defense for the Satanists, as my Wiccan/Witch fellows have already put in a good huzzah for them. This author really does need to do more research, and the quality of said research needs to improve greatly. Christians be warned, you are NOT getting an accurate description of Witchcraft, Wiccanism, and Satanism from this man. This book fuels only hatred, paranoia, and ignorance. There are other books by Christian authors, I am sure, that give a more accurate description of religions other than their own."
1,What a waste of paper.,"I would give this NO stars if I could. It is a complete waste of paper/disc space. It has facts confused, and spews outright lies. Wicca is a beautiful loving religion and this author, in true cult fashion, is trying to convince readers that their God is the only way, when in reality there are many ways. All gods are the same god, the same force which creates all, and Wicca is about light and love, no darkness involved. Like I said, COMPLETE waste of paper."
1,Christians are smarter than this,I don't think many Christians who read this book will come to any new conclusions to be fair. Either they will realize the idiocy or their minds were already made up!
3,"Not the best in the world, but certainly not the worst","As a Christian who strives to know more about things, I borrowed this book from a friend. Most books written on the occult are overly pushy, trying to get you to go one way or another. Near the end it is a little bit, and the story is definitely trying to say ""you shouldn't get into the occult"". That being said, I think it did a good job on the research it presented, and it isn't overly ""fluffy"" (trying to push you on way or another; many books are like this.). There are exceptions, but on the whole I would reccomend it for a beginning study. I'm just not going to use it as a bible though.And wiccans and Pagans, you can stop flaming the author now."
1,appalling,"first off, there are so many errors in this book about wicca it is shameful...i cannot believe that people actually believe this garbage. i agree with one of the earlier reviews, if you want to find more out about wicca, why dont you either talk to a wiccan, or read a book about wicca by a wiccan, instead of talking to some bible-thumping idiot who does not even know what he is talking about? i mean after all you are trying to learn about wicca right? not trying to look for an excuse to hate a religious group...secondly, this book attempts to draw connections between wicca and satanism that simply DONT EXISTlastly, this book paints the stereotype of a witch that the church and the religious right would have you believe is true, it is absolute folly and it is disgusting that there exist people who would probably condone the next batch of salem witch trials, living right here in america....absolutely deplorable"
2,Too Clunky,"The watch itself is not bad looking but a bit too big and loose. Again, if you have small wrists then the face of the watch might be large as well. It is something I will probably not travel with."
3,Could be better,My dual-faced watch is adequate for my needs. It was originally purchased for my 36-year-old daughter but the face (obviously to accommodate two clocks) is too large for her average-size wrist. Even though I have large wrists the latch is in the next-to-the-last hole leaving a lot of extra wrist band dangling. This superflous band refuses to stay in the clasp meant to hold it so I'm constantly tucking it back in. It's better suited for an average man's wrist.
3,Decent but not great,"I bought this for my wife as a gift since she travels alot for work. The style is nice and she likes the look. While the watch doesnt feel as robust as it looks Im sure it will last. The only real complaint is with the metal weave band, it does not stay in the ""clip"" that the band slips into."
5,"High quality recording, outstanding play",Emanuel Ax plays these challenging pieces beautifully with personal warmth and technical skill. The quality of the recording is very high.
3,Too pricey!,"Somehow I was led to believe that this was a multipack, so I was blown away when I realized I paid 9.99 for a 10 oz. package of pasta. For a dollar an ounce, I'd rather have a private chef prepare me a meal. Not a bad product, if you don't mind paying too much."
1,"Tried it once, but not twice",Product has taste and texture somewhere between a gummy bear and a strip of wet cardboard. Lacks flavor and el dente texture.
2,ok,"This pasta is not low in carbs, it has over 20 net carbs per serving and did not taste all that great either. not worth it same as regular durum wheat pasta at the market."
1,"NOT ""low carb""","18 net carbs is NOT low carb. You can reduce the number of carbohydrates but that does not make it low carb nor does it make it ""diabetic friendly"" as stated. If it is high in carbs which it is then it is not good for diabetics. Stop lying !"
4,Lynley and Havers,"The collection of Mystery's ""Inspector Lynley"" episodes is great. It takes liberties with Elizabeth George's stories, but it all works. If you like mysteries, this is the series for you. Well acted and well paced."
5,It's An Adaptation--not a word for word!!!,"I found this series to be delightful. I loved the books, but did not care that this series did not stick word for word with the books, or were as long as the books. This series is an adaptaion and was never hyped as anything but.As to the sexual tension, I got that from the books, too. Tommy was conflicted at times. But the series also kept to his love of Helen Clyde.I learned very early on that any book adapted for screen usually is not as goodas the book itself. So, as I don't expect them to be, I can enjoy them for what they are--really good mysteries BASED on Elizabeth George's works.I am glad I watched on PBS and that I spent the money to buy them to view again and again."
2,Also very dissapointed,"I have to agree with the previous writer. After viewing A Great Deliverance, I thought that the series would do a creditable job by these intricate and thought provoking mysteries. But the other adaptations of the following books were a great dissapointment. Characters were eliminated and plots simplified. But the worst of all is this growing sexual attraction/tension between Lynley and Havers. This just doesn't exist in the books. He's in love with Helen Clyde. Stick to the printed page!"
1,Inspector Lynley Mysteries Set 1,"After loving Inspector Morse and Inspector Jack Frost, we thought we'd try another British Mystery and bought Lynley. This is horrible soap opera and we were very disappointed. Couldn't watch the last disc it was so bad. If you like wierd soap operas get it. Otherwise save your money.Fred in New York"
3,Wrong Actor,I haven't viewed any of the DVD's or videos but I can tell by the Inspector depicted on the cover that he is wrong. Where is the beautiful blond hair that is described in so many books of Lynley's looks. If they are going to be put to video they should at least be true to the authour's descriptions.
2,Very Disappointed,"I had high hopes when I learned that PBS would be showing these adaptations of four of Elizabeth George's Lynley/Havers novels. The television version of George's ""A Great Deliverance"" had been well done, and I hoped to see that quality continued in these productions. When I watched the PBS broadcasts, my hopes were dashed. For some reason, the producers decided to try to fit these adaptations into a broadcast time of under 90 minutes each (whereas ""A Great Deliverance"" was a two-parter that ran for a total of nearly 3 hours). To do so, George's intricate, nuanced plots were butchered, and her complex character interactions reduced to mind-numbing simplicity. The one redeeming feature is that Nathaniel Parker gives a good performance as Tommy Lynley.Whether you are a lover of Elizabeth George's novels, as I am, or are just looking for a good mystery video, you should try something else, as this set would be a waste of money."
5,"great deal, great shoes","comfortable, easy on - off, good looking shoes in a hard to find sizefound 'em on Amazon at a great price, bought the last two pair they had (one year now on my old pair - getting a bit scuffed); once I'd tried them, just couldn't stand the thought of settling for less, being without.Very happy with the shoe-Amazon experience."
4,Clunky but comfortable,"The Galway Walker is a big shoe, fairly heavy and ""clunky""; but I can stand in them all day without my feet complaining. Not best for walking. Great for standing!"
3,Propet Galway Walker,Shoe does not have a narrow heal and that has resulted in the shoe slipping off. Width at toes and cushioning are fine.
4,Men's Propet Galwat Walker,"If you need a very comfortable/work shoe and you just so happen to have duck feet, then this is the shoe for you, my husband loves these."
2,heavy shoes,The quality of Propet shoes is not as good as I expect. The shoes are very heavy and stiff and they look clunky also.
3,EEE was narrower than expected,I bought these for my dad. He's a big fan of propet shoes since they come in a extra wide. This style was narrower than others from this same brand so we returned them
5,Brilliant!,"This book is absolutely brilliant. More than a bunch of random statistics thrown together, this book makes me laugh out loud multiple times per page. If the great content weren't enough, the juxtaposition of various stats is so clever. Case in point, something like ""The percent of 70 year old men who say their wives are more beautiful than they were when first married - 74%. Next stat: The percent of 70 year old men who need glasses: 89%.Stuff like this is what the book is about - truly an impressive compendium, well delivered.I can only imagine what kind of work must have gone into writing such a book. As another reviewer wrote, this is the perfect bathroom book. Buy it - you won't regret it."
3,"Interesting Trivia, Horrible Design","Lots of interesting trivia in this book, but the design is horrid enough to make the book nearly unreadable. (Click ""Search Inside"" to see for yourself.) Several obvious errors throughout."
5,Cheap at half the price,"This classic is one of my favourites McDonald Carey is great (see Cave Of Outlaws) Maureen O'Hara is as beautifull as ever. Highly rec. BUT just before you rush to buy this plus several others that have ben restored think Australia Gun For A Coward, Tomahawk, Canyon Passage and Comanche Territory all sell for $6 Australian and if you fancy fout titles then its $20 for 4 there are a stack of FULLY REMASTERED classics in Australia won't play in the USA you say well a multi zone dvd player retails in Australia for under $15 just buy an adaptor and start saving a bundle. Back to the film great colour sound in fact all was great including the price I paid. Happy viewingAl Watts"
4,I USUALLY HATE WESTERNS!,"I usually hate Westerns, but I love this film! Maureen O'Hara is as feisty as ever. The only sad part is knowing that Jim Bowie dies in real life!"
3,Outstanding scenery!,This movie was filmed in Sedona AZ which has grown somewhat since 1950 but the scenery is almost as beautiful now as it was then!
1,Amazon does not deliver on promise.,I ordered this product and waited and waited for it to arrive.All I got was an e-mail saying that Amazon actually did not have this product available.
4,Good,"This is a book for those who may be going through some sort of mental or emotional struggle. There is a lot of wisdom to be gained from this easy to read book, in spite of the title ""Fool"". I loved how the main character was portrayed as a fool but in the end he became the person he was meant to always be. This was a really upbeat read and the kind that I enjoy."
5,the manic stock market days of the 1980's,"The 2nd novel from a new to me author.A redemption comedy set in the manic stock market days of the 1980's. With a top education and connections to all the right people investment broker Barnaby is 46 and has always gotten along by his charm and instincts, until a deal ending in an epic fail leads to a 4 month suspension by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And banishment from everything he has known.Set adrift we watch Barnaby as he comically and with wry self analysis moves two setps forward and one step back. All with delicious writing keeping you interested. Probably not every one's cup of tea but this Banker from New England liked it.I found the introduction by Nancy Pearl a must read and the further reading at the back of the book a bonus. I was disappointed in the Book Club guide which had only 5 questions."
2,not for me,"Everyone has their thing, this just isn't mine. I think you may like it though. Don't go by my review, I have unique tastes."
1,Fool,"I purchased FOOL for my Kindle. As my Kindle uses percentages and not pages, I have to say that I slogged through ten percent of it and threw in the towel. This book may be someone's cup 'o' tea, but it surely did not turn out to be mine, and I have a wide variety of reading interests. The tennis tournament was interminable. I decided there were too many other interesting books out there to waste any more time on this one. This is my very first book review for Amazon, and I'm so sorry it has to be in the negative. So, I'm going to just cut my losses spent on the book and remove it from my Kindle."
3,Nancy Pearl and I like different things!,"I bought this book because it was recommended by Nancy Pearl, who I like to hear on the radio.It is a rather silly book about a silly man. He does seem to pull himself together toward the end. He is someone from a privileged background who leads others to lose money in an investment scheme. He is self involved and a not very good husband and parent. Maybe I am missing something that Nancy found in this book."
4,A Niche Book,"This is the kind of book which will attract a polarity of reactions. If you like a more meandering plot with a fairly likable but unconventional protagonist whose story is supported by skillful writing, you may love this book. However, if you prefer a more classic story structure with an admirable main character, you may not be enthralled by it.I enjoyed the writing, but not the story line as much, and that's purely a matter of personal taste. If you like unconventional and humorous stories with some unsavory characters, you might enjoy this tale."
3,realistic,All the emotions and feelings were very realistic. It pulled you into the story that way. Rather neighborly story that anyone laid off from the current downturn economy could feel.
1,Fool,This is the first book that I couldn't get into. I read the first couple of chapters and still didn't know where the book was going so I gave up.
1,Dull,Wasn't my type of book tried to read it since my daughter accidently downloaded in onto my kindle but couldn't finish it.
2,awful,"hard to use her ""50 page"" rule on a kindle...I tried to hang in there ...it just did not work for me"
2,Just can't get into it,The book starts off on a tennis court I and I feel like the writer has more story in their head than on the pages. It is disconnected. I am an avid reader and just could not get into this. I will pick it up and try it again. Next time I purchase a book on my kindle I will read more of the example before buying it! I guess I was the real fool for buying it.
1,Strange,"I haven't finished it yet and I doubt that I will. The dominate character needs help badly. Pearl's intro enticed me to read or try to read this book, but there are too many other books to waste time on a book I don't enjoy. Trying to sort through the context is impossible."
4,Sharpie washes off,"These are great. Great size, texture, material.Mine came with a tiny pencil, but instead I used sharpie to write on them. Inside, with my seedlings, they fared well. I put the plants outside, however, and left the stakes with the plants. After a period of time outside, and watering, they are white again.Good news is that means they are reusable.Bad news is, if you wanted to remember what variety a plant was, you'd better have kept notes."
2,Horrible for writing on,"If you want to use a pencil to write on these forget it. A marker works well but you can erase the marker to reuse the stake. So, if you plant the same thing and want to always have the same labels makers work well. For writing with a pencil to erase and reuse, don't buy these."
2,"Puccini - Madame Butterfly / Huang, Troxel","This recording has several ""breaks"" or ""skips"" in the flow of the music. If it were an old LP record I'd look for a scratch. I received a second product from the seller - but it was exactly the same . . . so the problem is the actual recording. Look for another Madame Butterfly because this will annoy you every time you listen to it."
1,peeling finish,"Looked good when new, however after 3 months all of the gold plating has peeled off. Would not recommend if planning on using on a daily basis."
2,Interesting Stuff - crappy production values,"This is a nice reading of Tolle's work, done by the author. Comments about his reading style aside (to each his own in the regard), these CDs have a serious problem: the tracks do not break at sensible points. Some tracks begin with the sound of a bell and Tolle beginning to talk about an idea or read from the start of a chapter or section. Other tracks, most of them in fact, begin in the middle of a talk someplace, and a more than a few begin in the middle of sentences.If you're listening to it straight through, you won't notice. But if you want to stop at the end of a track and then start the next track in sequence later, the editing makes doing so extremely difficult. Instead of just remembering which track you last listened to, you have to remember which track and how far into the track you were when you hit pause or stop.Most annoying."
3,Dry reading,"I wasn't expecting such a dry book. I had to force myself to keep reading, after a few chapters I gave up."
5,"Great Book, Live in the Present","After reading many many books by several empowering authors such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dalai Lama, Marianne Williamson, and Tiffany Snow, that I am still reading, my life has opened up to me in such a compelling and wonderful way. This new book is well written, and thought provoking. There are great transforming authors, who shift the consciousness of humankind in a way never known before. The ""Power of Now"" is one of those."
4,Good read,"Inspirational and definitely a good read. I would recommend to others. I pick this book up when I need a reality check, to focus on the present instead of letting my mind roam."
3,Being Fully Involved in Whatever...,"As another reviewer stated ""the title says it all."" The ""trick"" is to find an activity, pastime, relationship, hobby, vocation, etc. [or a series of them] which engage(s) us fully. OR, be in a circumstance in which the REALITY OF THE PRESENT cannot be avoided [war, starvation, etc.] Persons faced with imminent death know about the NOW."
5,"ancient wisdom, modern twist","Each person looking for a way to make it through our so-called lives can findsomething inspiring in this book. It rings true, and can be connected to our Judeo-Christiancore values, if that is important to you. Even if it isn't, thousands of years of wisdom areconcentrated in the author's words, and useful for finding some calm in this disturbed world."
3,Hard for me to follow,"My native language is german, but I have lived in the US for almost 14 years now. I am a super busy Mom and I bought this as it was recommended to me. I saw the reviews and was super excited to listen to this. However, it is a little hard for me to follow. Not sure if I have a problem concentrating on it since my mind seems to be always going, or if it is the language..... I will try again though, since I would really like to get into it. But after I listen for 5 minutes the first time I was done..... (I listened to it at night to calm down before sleeping and it worked in the regards that I fell asleep within minutes.)"
4,"""The Power of Now""","""The Power of Now"" content is top-notch spiritual teaching: clear, deep, and a wonderful synthesis of the many ""ways"" and aspects of various spiritual systems. Tolle's teaching gift comes unmistakably from groundedness in Being, consciously free of his egoic-self. An accompanying table of contents,not provided, would facilitate smoother study and render it a 5 star for sure."
5,"Spiritual, simple, wonderful","If you are ready this book will change your life. The no nonsense, no New Age jargon, non heavy handed approach is not only welcoming but inclusive in addressing the religious and non-religious but spiritual alike. I cannot recommend this book enough. And after you've read this you'll undoubtedly want the next book, ""A New Earth""."
2,waste of my money,The book came to me in good shape and as stated in the description when i bought it. I just DO NOT LIKE this book!! It was a waste of my money!! it's too hard to understand so much of it and I struggled through what I DID read although i didn't finish it. It's just not interesting. (to me).
3,not as great as I thought,"I was very excited to get this book due to all the great reviews, but honestly I have had a hard time getting into it. I don't think I am past page 30."
5,The Power of Now,"This book is life changing. It is the way of life. An easy read- although should be relished over and over. Once you catch on, 'your' life will never be the same! There is no need to ever buy another self help book again- and you are free to sell all of your others on Amazon as they will no longer be needed."
5,A gift to an awakening humanity,This book has been such an unbelievable gift for me. It has been a dear friend in the cave of my heart in this process of awakening. The most important book I have ever spent time with(and still do). Thank you!
5,Tying it all together,"As a seeker but also a skeptic, the world's religions were too enigmatic for me to understand. Eckhart Tolle ties together the essence of spiritualism and the practicality of science that makes sense of life and our universe. He feeds both sides of the brain."
4,Good book,"This is a great book, written by someone who awaked. It is easy to read and easy to understand, but doesn't go very deep. It help greatly in giving clarity to women regarding periods and their real meaning.Many now a days have discover their real self and are now teaching you to live in the moment, etc., without real experience with the teaching part. It will confuse the new seeker to turn truth into what it is not. In the book of John Parker ""Dialogue with Emerging spiritual teacher""(which Eckart Tolle is included) is a great example of teachers's different level of perspective being asked the same questions. "" Teachers of One Living Advaita "" also give a similar perspective."
5,Quiet Desperation,"Henry David Thoreau wrote ""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation,"" yet it doesn't need to be so. In The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle reminds us that our inner voice ""comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains"" and that this voice isn't necessarily relevant to our present situation. We revive past wrongs, or rehearse and imagine future outcomes that drain our vital energy. Tolle teaches us how to quiet the mind - our unconscious resistance to what is - and instead focus our attention into the now. May his powerful message help you understand that the present moment is all you ever have. And moreover may you learn to quiet any desperation in your life, and live in peace."
5,Eckhart has a way with words,"The Power of Now shook the foundations of my beliefs. Eckhart's writing style is inviting and he explains difficult thoughts and ideas. When I first read this several years ago, I put it down for a while, then my curiosity caused me to continue, and I'm glad I did. The concept of the present time ""the Now,"" is on target with helping us realize - regretting the past or worrying about the future takes us away from the joy of now.I recall a quote by an anonymous Nun which is a good summary of Eckhart's wonderful book:""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift, that is why it is called the present.""If you want to live now and find the peace which passes all understanding, read this book!"
5,Life Changing,"As I tell family and friends: it's not an easy read at first, but you get used to the language. And when you begin to understand what he's saying about the human condition and, in a nutshell, why we're so miserable and what we can do to end the suffering... it not only makes sense but it's a solution that's been THERE and INSIDE YOU all this time! I've begun implimenting his teachings into my life (enjoying the ""now"" instead of being upset about the past, or worrying about the future) and I feel so at peace. My children are happier, I don't fight with my husband nearly as much, TRAFFICE doesn't even bother me! The other day... I made my own stomach ache go away when I started to get nurvous about being late. I took a moment, remembered to enjoy that moment, and the pain stopped. I felt calm, at ease... and I wasn't late after all."
2,The Power of now,"This book is a little ""out there"", I felt a bit lost trying to listen to it on audio CD. I would not buy it again."
3,The Power of Now,"In reading this book, I felt as though there is only way to achieve more conscienceness...getting your mind out of the way. And there was only one goal...being. There was no getting there or journey. There was no exploring, just the goal, no path. I think life is all about the trip, not the ultimate destination, and I think this book is all about the destination. This is too much 0 to 100 in ten seconds. I think Judith Wright's book, There Must Be More Than This considers that the reader is on a journey to conscienceness and writes with that in mind. I liked her book better."
1,A Book on Meditation - But Beware.....,"Seems like Eckhart Tolle took Zen Buddist concepts, added a dash of Christianity, and wrote a book. The basic concept is to find a way to quiet your mind and live in the Now. Great ideas.However, the book is not helpful. When the author tries talk about adopting his concepts to the everyday world, reality gets in the way. For example, he recommends that we let go of the concept of ""time."" Later, when addressing this cosmic concept, he retreats to a more practical approach - we're to let go of ""psychological time"" but keep ""clock time.""And, suggesting that we let go of our ego just seemed plain ironic in light of the author's apparent self regard.I was so frustrated, I quit the audio tape half way through."
3,"Now, The Practical Application Is...?","I rather liked the Question and Answer format of the book. It provided a good transition to further explain some of the concepts. But I was disappointed that the practical application was lacking. If I can't use these concepts everyday, and know how to apply them in specific situations, they aren't very helpful. One example is ""All you need to do is end the delusion of time."" Huh? How do you incorporate this in your day to day activities? And don't forget to pick up your kids at school at 3:30 and file your tax return by April 15th, whenever that might be in this delusional world."
1,nothing here,"I am glad to see on reviews of this book, that so far, many of the negative ones have not been deleted as has happened in his book A New earth when ten reviews last week that were negative were taken off the site. They were not nasty just negative like many of the reviews here.I agree with the reviewers here that got little benefit from this book.They said it all and better for me. Be warned though if you are reading this and thinking of writing a negative review it may not stay on site for long."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I picked this up, flipped through the intro and remainder of book, and couldn't see myself wasting my time on this book.The author comes with no qualifications whatsoever, and his mumble jumble sounds like a man with a bigger ego wanna be heard kinda rant.Honestly, I saw nothing in this book for me, maybe you will, but I didn't."
1,Your stupid book made BiBi quit,"""The Power of Now""is a horrible book and Eckhart Tolle's writing sucks and thanks to his stupid book.BiBi Jones,the hottest pornstar in the world quit,leaving thousands if not millions of people sad.So his book might have help her life but it left many more people sad as a result.And if ask me that goes against every these types of books are suppposed to be.This book has left many people miserable"
3,Same as Buddhist Teachings,"First of all, I need to come clean: I have not read the book, just the reviews. I'm sure that this book has value for many people. Please, just realize that Buddhism (and probably other religions/philosophies) have long taught the same thing. Many Buddhist meditations are about stilling the mind and dealing with afflictive emotions (anger, greed, lust, etc.).If you like this book, that's great, but please be aware that these ideas have been around for some time. You may also benefit from books on Buddhist meditation, no matter what your religious affiliation or faith."
1,The Power of Now,"The concept that ""we live in the now"" is something I believe in. The delivery of the audio would have put me to sleep if I continued to listen past CD #1 and I wasn't driving. I do not recommend this book to anyone interested in getting motivated for personal growth."
1,Order one thing and receive another,"I ordered the book ""the Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightment"" and received a totally different book. I sent two emails to the seller explaining the mistake and I have not received any feedback or the book. I am extremely disappointed with this transaction."
5,This book changed my life... I'm free from the pain!,"I bought this book trying to discover how to become more spiritual, but what I got was the answer to virtually every problem in my life! The reviews you read here are true. This is such a great book. Do you have ""baggage"" in your life that's interfering with your relationships? This book can change that. Are you your own worst enemy? This book can change that. Do you have people in your life who constantly drag you down or [drag] you into their problems? This book can change that? Do you worry all the time? This book can change that. Whether you are religious or not, it doesn't matter. This book speaks to you on a different level than you've ever realized is within you. I recommend the audio book. Tolle speaks very slowly, but that's okay, because there is SO much to think about and absorb in what he's saying that slow is good."
4,Excellent selection,I was so pleasantly surprised on reading this book. It was everything I needed to hear
2,Know what you believe,"I read this book and listened to the tape. Tolle is a gifted communicator of spiritual ideas. But Tolle is a man, not God, and remember: he's selling something. His main points, that we are not our minds and we should live in the present, are presented in the most clear and persuasive manner I've ever seen. I've found them enormously helpful. Yet, as a lifelong Lutheran, I am skeptical of the many ""spiritual truths"" he issues so declaratively. He also endorses ""A Course in Miracles,"" a New Age text supposedly channeled straight from God. It's time to start asking questions about his ideas. A good place to start would be Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays, edited by Robert Basil. Other books about New Age thinking can be found in libraries. Just do a subject search on ""New Age movement."" Don't just adopt religious ideas because someone states them in a soothing, authoritative way--and various celebrities thought the book was great. Your soul and mind are too important."
1,Psychobabble on Steroids,"This book was created by a down on his luck nobody preying on the insecurities and fears of the masses in order to gain a following and all the cash that goes with it. His ideas are complex, disjointed, confusing and misleading. Rather than encouraging people to face reality and stand up to bullies and abusers, he advises people who have been bullied and abused to ""surrender"" to them. That is the worst counsel you can give to someone who has been traumatized."
1,The Power of Now CD,Never received this item and was dissapointed that it was listed as available when they knew they didn't have it.
1,short version,"Boring. These are not original ideas and the style drags and drags. If the author cited his sources, I might have been able to tolerate it. I wouldn't suggest to anyone to read this book for the spiritual content -- as others comment, there are far better books for that."
2,"Try reading Gangaji, she's the goods","For the same information delivered with more elegance, authenticity, and passion, read anything by a woman in Northern California named Gangaji. She lives and radiates what Eckhart tries so hard to intellectualize. Also try to see a video of one of her talks--the light in her eyes and in her laugh reflects the truth of her words and goes straight to your heart.It's like the difference between reading a very good cookbook and feasting on a divine meal....Gangaji is satisfying beyond the intellect. Not a best-seller, at least not yet, but she's the real deal."
5,"Tolle, Yes/ Also read SB: 1 or God","Spiritual enlightenment is one thing, and how to recieve it is another. The Power of Now is highly educating which brings strong reasoning and is not so difficult to apply if you so wish. Whether you agree with anything in the book or not, the premise will leave you rethinking for the better especially for personal advancement, no matter what your faith is. Indeed we need to be constantly educated and enlightened, Tolle has certainly done this at a minimum. A book I strongly suggest exploring which opens up a cache of understanding and spiritual enlightenment is SB: 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox"
4,The Power Of Now,"The book came later than promised. However, it is in exelllent condition; worth the wait. From what I have read so far, I am sure it is exactly what I wanted."
4,Brilliant..but...,"Live Like A Fruit Fly, a book i recently found on amazon, is much more practical and can make a big impact on your life. It did with me."
1,Hard reading,"I gave up on this book after drearily trudging through 3 chapters of a writing style that is hard to read. Tolle's Q&A; format results in a choppy, disjointed lecture in which concepts are introduced without sufficient background or explanation. For examele, Tolle immediately lumps all thinking together. The reading would have been facilitated if Tolle had laid out early on a reasonable distinction between useful and useless thinking.Other concepts are also poorly introduced (Being, One Life, Identification with Mind) and leave the reader wondering what Tolle is talking about.Much of Tolle's obfuscational verbiage offers old ideas dressed up in new words. After 3 chapters, I stopped wondering what he was talking about and donated my copy to the Salvation Army."
4,Wise words,"What would our world be like if instead of compulsive thinking, we could all become compulsively ""present"" to ourselves and to each other? ""Being,"" says Tolle, is the ever present One Life. Being present in the ""Now"" helps us untangle from compulsive thought so that there is more space for wisdom and grace. This is the Power of Now. Tolle's discussion explores the dynamics of this process from many different angles. I enjoyed the wisdom of this book."
4,Great place to start,I really enjoyed the book. I am reading the book for the second time at the moment and I am also highlighting the important parts of the book because I know I will read it again. The book is put into very simple terms and the book will be easy to follow and understand.
2,Not worth the time and money,"The simple fact of being aware with now is eloborated to 8 CDs and a book.One can get the same information much more easily by reading few buddhist meditation books, take less time to read or listen and make a point quickl in a easy understandable way"
2,This book took a Tolle on me.,"I found a lot of Mr. Tolles ideas a bit eccentric and a bit off the wall. While I think he has a handle on spirituality, I'm not entirely sure he has a firm grip on that handle. The one thing that was glaring (by omission,) was a feeling of joy! The ideas were written in a style almost devoid of personality and joy, leaving me kind of empty. That's not to say I didn't understand or appreciate the concepts, nor was the book poorly written - it just seemed formulaic and not particularly graceful."
5,Simply blown away!,"I, like many others, have already read many books on inner peace and the like. But this book has just opened my mind in whole new ways. The way this author words everything is perfect. I used to have a really bad problem with constant anxiety, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it was coming from or even how to get rid of it. Thanks to the guidance in this book, that is now all but a thing of the past for me. I cant believe though this book has been out for over ten years, and I am just now coming across it. But of course that's completely irrelevant, and I'm just so happy to of found it now. :)"
5,A great read from a great teacher,"As a mindfulness psychotherapist and teacher and author of 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' (Amazon), I frequently refer this book to my clients. It is a refreshing re-presentation of the essential teachings of the Buddha on the very human challenge that we all face - the balance between the world of conditioned ""things"", the emotional-thought products of the small mind, the ego, and the unconditioned dimension of pure spacious awareness that is our actual true nature and the fabric of our being. Eckhart gives us the practical insights to ""break through to the other side."""
4,The Power of Now,"We all spend a lot of time thinking about our negative past and negative future, trapped in the cycle of unhappiness that we don't have enough time to be at peace in our mind. This book is about living in the moment and quieting our mind. If you want to find a deeper sense of peace, I highly recommend this book"
4,enlighting,A reflection on an excercise hard practice in our hectic lives. Being present in the moment and the power that can have in our lives. It's a good book to read when you have time alone and can concentrate.
5,A Marvelous Book!,"The book has very powerful teachings. Eckhart Tolle is an enlightened soul bring in light in the darkness of our mind. If we live in the present, and don't dwell in the past or don't run after the future, we live our life full of joy, beauty, creativity and love. The present, as he says, cannot have any problem as the present is only action: we have to accept it, ignore it or solve it. The way he explains how we can make our relationships full of love and compassion, how we can dissolve our pain-body and transcend our base emotions to the noble ones, is remarkable, with brevity of words and flowing logic. I recommend everyone to read this book!"
4,Practical book,"This is a spititual book and it is so practical at the same time. Tolle gives us one of the most valuable techniques for practicing the power of now. If you follow Tolle and his mind journey I promise you a great joy in discovering your own true self. What is missing from this book is mind programming techniques like hypnosis. My point here is to write the main exercises and program your mind with these suggestions. So if you want to find what a real inner joy is , buy the book."
5,Very good book for those on the more spiritual side...,"This and Eckhart Tolle's follow up book, A New Earth, are both great! I prefer this over the more recent one. I think A New Earth got more exposure and hype because it was on Oprah and such a big Skype discussion for several of her shows. But this one, The Power of Now, was easier for me to grasp and didn't seem as repetitive. A New Earth, basically said the same things this book said, in a different way. The Power of Now is the better read in my opinion. You can also try listening to it on audio book."
3,Interesting Ideas,"Although the ideas were interesting and worth considering, this book sometimes comes off as condescending and insensitive in its question answer format."
2,Basically a rehashing of old eastern ideas,"I read this book after it was recommended to me. The beginning chapter where he talks about becoming aware of his ego mind chatter was interesting, but the rest of the book is written in a question and answer format and seems to not really have any new ideas. He may have been ""enlightened"" for a while and it was amazing, but what he is talking about can be found in many other texts that have already been written. He is banking in the western world's ignorance of these ancient concepts that were already known. He succeeds in telling you how bad the ego is and that ""thinking is bad"" but with no backing in how to achieve what he is saying. I have tried to go back and read this book again, thinking I must have missed something since Oprah and Jim Carrey apparently love this book and it changed their lives, but I could not continue with the book."
5,Should be a bible companion..,All Christians and everyone who believes in what the bible says should absolutely read this book. Reading this book opened up the bible for me in ways that I never thought imaginable. This book made my relationship with God seamless.
2,So-so - do I need a college degree to read this or what??,"A friend of mine recommended this book. He is a personal trainer, and I am a female who really NEEDS a personal trainer but who cannot afford one (him) at the present moment. I have a weight/food issue, and he told me to go buy this book and it would change my life, he promised! ha ha.I am a college graduate, and am about 40 pages into this book. While I can appreciate SOME of what he is saying, this book is rathy wordy, and very difficult to follow. I found myself reading a paragraph and then trying to sort it out in my head, and thinking. . Hmm, maybe it will get LESS confusing as I go along? Uh, no. That did not happen. I will try hard to finish this book, but I doubt it is going to be as enjoyable a ride for me as it was for others. Maybe I just don't ""get it."""
5,Provocative,"This book is a bestseller because it provides us with frame work to lifes many challenging questions. The Power of Now has differentiated for me the two things I hold in high esteem, namely my family and myself. By doing this I am in a better position to make decisions (by not intermingling these two). Another book that has proven very influential to me is Dreams: Gateway to the True Self. It's a parallel of this book in that Dreams identifies the self and provides structure to the endless sea of jargon surrounding the unconscious. Many have read both and liked what they have read."
5,Superb!,"If there was only one book i could read for the rest of my life, this would be it! Tolle speaks to the ""knower"" behind the knowing. Read it and experience it for yourself...."
5,What a MINDBLOWER!,I have no words to describe how profoundly this book has changed me AND my life. This book is unbelieveable!. I was mesmerized by every word ... AWESOME! Whewwwww!
5,Excellent,"I highly recommend this book. My dad and I both read it and it's changed our lives. Of course, it takes work to remember the teachings, but it is very helpful nonetheless."
5,A bedside table must have,"Tolle takes you on the path to finding what's real in a simple, straight forward and yet challenging way. Excellent read."
5,The Power of Now on CDs,I have so enjoyed these CDs. The material is fascinating to me. Easy to understand - but it takes practice to be able to do. I will listen to these over and over!
2,Audiobook CD version is not good quality,"First, let me say that I love this book, but the audiobook version is very disappointing. I want to share this book with as many people in my life that I can, and my husband only listens to audiobooks, so I bought this for him. He doesn't like it at all, and I listened to it, it is very hard to hear the speaker, the tone of voice isn't very excited or animated at all, and I could not listen to it for very long."
5,THANK YOU.,This is a powerfull book. Most every page resonates with my deepest core.As an author myself I want to thank you for writing this enlightening book. Your words gave me support and your method opens up for even more joy!
5,Life Altering,"The best book I've ever read on how to live in the ""now"" and what that really means. The book quite simply, transformed my life in a minute. The author writes in a clear concise way and everything he says makes perfect sense. Reading this book is like turning on a lightbulb over your head and realizing the lights mostly been switched off. There's no other word for it except amazing."
1,Couldn't Get Through It,I've tried reading this book.... twice. The only reason I give it one star is that zero stars aren't an option. People rave about Eckhart Toile but I simply don't see the attraction. His views weren't life changing or new in my opinion. I found it tedious & boring.
2,Had to Stop Reading,"I started reading this book after two individuals recommended it to me. I am finding myself more self-critical, more anxious, and more judgmental since starting the book. Today I decided to stop reading it. Perhaps it is unfair to rate the book given that I will not read the entire book, but I am surprised that so many people think this book is so special. I just hear the same thing being spoken over and over and over. Okay, I get it, live in the now. I like the ideas of dealing with pain bodies and analyzing emotions/reactions. Perhaps I am not mentally ready for the book. I may try to read it again at a later date."
3,"New Age spin on Old Idea, Positive and Uplifting!","This book will probably not change anyone's life. It is a little self-righteous, kind of you'll-understand-when-you're-older style, but I liked it. It's an easy read and a great concept! It is well written and a state of being that deserves attention. If this book is calling to you, or you find your mind racing and worrying about everything except what is happening right now at this moment, then this book will bless your life!"
5,ONE OF THOSE BOOKS!,"Every now and then you come across a book that really has an impact on your life and the capacity to change how you view yourself and the world around you. The Power of Now is such a book that has a very simple message (be in the now) but tells it in such a powerful and convincing way that you cannot go back to how life was before you read it. If you are interested in living your life being aware and at peace with yourself and everything in the world, this is the book for you."
5,Live in the present moment,"We are bombarded by information in our lives. We all try to do so many things at once. I guess it is called ""multi tasking"".This book will teach you how to calm your mind down and get in touch with the many inner resources you already have.Happy reading."
5,LIFE CHANGING,"There is no way you can read this work and not have your consciousness changed. It demands your soul to take action. It changes your life.G BiagaseeAuthor of ""Live Your Own Life, Die Your Own Death"""
2,Not a fan of this book!,"This book means well but it seemed to make me think more! I have been suffering with a little anxiety and got this book hoping it would help.. it did not. It made me feel like my way of thinking was completely wrong and backwards. It creeped me out the way the author says to basically quit thinking- I don't think that's a good way to approach life. I can understand calming your mind but completely shutting it down just seems unreasonable to me. However, I did take away the lesson that you should try and live more in the moment instead of constantly obsessing on the future/past."
2,difficult to finish,"I'll make this short and sweet, ok maybe not so sweet. I listened to this audiobook and was determined to finish listening to the end as I had hoped the point the author was trying to convey would deliver some profound spiritual message. In a way it did... Live life in the here and now as it is the ""now"" thinking that creates everything else.THAT is the bottom line.... Listening to the monotonous drone ofEckhart Tolle was excruciating. I had also found a DVD lecture given by this author which I watched out of curiosity and thought that Mr Tolle exhibits a bit of ""egoic superiority""... Ok ok he's human.The basic message,(as written above) is the essence and is an important one. so I give this review 2 stars for that."
3,I'm glad I borrowed the book.,"A friend loaned me this book after I told her that I had not read it. Her comment was ""This book will eat your lunch!""Well this book did NOT eat my lunch. I had already learned most of what was in here in my years of exploring MANY spiritual traditions while I was trying to find a faith that answered my spiritual questions.If you have not walked down the many far eastern paths (as I have), you will probably find this book VERY enlightening, and help you live your life in a conscious manner.Personaly; I believe a study of Zazen from Zen Buddhism will assist more than this book about living in the present; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,nothing new,"I read a dozen of these books when I was in my late teens. This version regurgitates the bulk of its ideas from Zen Buddhism with a splash of Taoism. Like rows of other books it says meditation can be beneficial, harboring destructive emotions can manifest itself in lots of ugly ways, finding a peace within can create tangible outer benefits....I'm not surprised that some people would love this book and benefit from reading it in the same way opportune timing can match a lonely man with someone to love, a friend can take a drunk to an AA meeting or a priest can offer meaning to someone in the throws of helplessness but it doesn't change the fact that the totality of new ideas would only fill a pamphlet.There are plenty of truths in this book and some people gain confidence in their own insights when they see those ideas in print but the practical benefit anyone might derive from this book will only ever be their own acceptance and appreciation of that which they already know and have."
5,Go beyond the ego,"This book is about going beyond the ego and to stop allowing yourself to be controlled by it. There are other philosophies similar to this such as the Tao De Ching. This book is presented in a way that anyone can understand, and shows you what you need to know. All you have is now, and to be fully present means to be outside of the ego.The Power of Now is your personal power brought to light, to show you the power you have over your life and to show you that you are not a victim in any sense. You are in control and this is a huge step towards becoming a spiritual being. Become now, become present, and see the power you have always had...."
1,stay away - read mindell instead,"Tolle is deeply routed in the phantasy that there can be peace and good free from all of those 'bad' things. This extends to being free from power dynamics and the like. This is a little juvenile.There are good and bad things in Tolle's world. The ego vs. the self, clock time vs psychological time and so forth. More sophisticated authors move beyond this immature lens of the world.Underneath all his failings, he hits a kernel of truth supported by authors such as Joseph Campbell, Jung, or Arnold Mindell. Read them rather."
1,Terrible !!,The Author tries to use Buddhist / Zen fundamentals but yet never truly acknowledges that or gives any credit to anyone but himself. He always tries to say things that the reader would like to read. He tries to give advise and 'teach' psychology which are way beyond his expertise -- because he is not a psychologist !! I think the problem is celebrities like Oprah highly 'boost' books / authors such as him b/c they themselves like these sort of 'feel good' types of books. But in the end it's readers such as us who end up absorbing all this nonsense.
5,be here now,"I finally read this book. It's a total game changer. For more of a kick in the butt though, check out Live Like A Fruit Fly."
4,THE POWER OF NOW,THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THE ADVANCED SPIRITUALIST. IT SPEAKS OF LIVING IN THE NOW AND THE FUTURE AND NOT TO LOOK BACK AT THE PAST. IT WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE READ.
5,fast service,Received the book vey fast and the condition is as described or even better. Will order here again with confidence. Thanks.
4,Good practical read,"Just finished the book and can say it was pretty good,especially the first half. This is something anyone can practice (Nowness) and make oneself more alert.The book got off track a little talking about men/women/civilization issues that make it not a completely self improvement guide. I sense a lot of the information is quite similar to Scientology- isness, present time (now), body-pain (engram) and the issue of our civilization. Wonder if he got some of the ideas from Ron Hubbard/Scientology? Nevertheless, this was a better than average book."
5,Practical and Useful,"I have listened to this audio book repeatedly, and felt that my relative could also use the grounded enlightenment it offers. I feel that anyone could find something of value in this book. I cannot find arguments that hold up against this very life-affecting approach."
5,"A+ excellent, thank you",the power of now is an excellent read for anyone on that spiritual path. Helps bring you to this present moment.
3,"A couple of good points, but that's it.","I found the book to be overly repetitive. The author mentions this, but it gets boring soon enough.Un-enlighten when he judges every-other with words such as ""most people..."" How does he know about people that do not meditate as he does? Totally made up! The book contains some imprecision's on the historical references mentions and other factual happenings."
1,The Power of Gibberish,"Don't know what Oprah is thinking about the ability of the author's words to inspire. I found it practically unreadable but laced here and there with some truthful generalities. I'd say Eckhardt Tolle has found a self-help formula that chooses gibbberish words from columns A and B that sells books. I purchased the book to take on a trip. Unable to stay with it, I even tried moving forward and finally gave up."
5,Life Changing & Amazing!,"This book started me on a path to listen to almost every piece of audio I could find taught by Eckhart Tolle. His teachings are more than words can describe.My life has change 180 - from depression medication and not caring about living, to really enjoying who I am and really enjoying this dance we call our lives.I feel invincible, now, in that I'm not afraid of much nor do I stress about much. And, even when I do, it feels like a test and I actually feel good when something that use to be bad comes into my life. I've tried to share my experience with a few and I've had poor results...lol. But, anyway, get it and remember that words are like sign posts - they only point to a destination... sometimes people get lost (aka: bad reviews)."
2,Will put you to sleep.,"The actual material is interesting if you can stay awake long enough to pay attention to it. But what it doesn't say anywhere is that the author actually reads this in his own monotone british accent. I think this book is actually a driving hazard if you plan to listen to it at night, it will put you to sleep (the audio cd)!"
3,Solid introductory material,"The idea of ""the now"" can be difficult to grasp intellectually. Tolle's experiential approach attempts to help us avoid the tendency to overanalyze everything that challenges our present reality. Although I personally consider this basic reading material, for the beginner it provides a path from everyday consciousness into awakening. I recommend Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn in lieu of (or as a supplement to) The Power of Now It is more concise and covers the same idea."
3,power of now,Book is a little hard to get through but if you can get a few nuggets from the chapters and walk away with a litte bit more than you started with - worth the cost
5,Rome Saranto Review,"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual EnlightenmentThis book sheds light on the subject of the overwhelming ego in Men and Women and how it controls us. It explains how to not only observe the unconscious programming, but how to train your mind to overcome it a discover who you are truly meant to be."
3,The Buddhist culture in english words,"We can feel his spiritual touch!à noter que: The 1st 100 pages are valuable, the rest is just a repeat."
5,Excellent Book,"I have always thought I was a ""spiritual"" person, but this book is a real eye-opener. I love to read and I'd highly recommend this book for those searching for true spirituality and happiness in their lives. He presents his case for ""living in the now"" and just what that means to him. Although it's not excactly a new concept, the wisdom he imparts is priceless. Great read!"
1,Author has over-simplified,"Author has over-simplified and compromised the essence of spiritualityWhen you claim well documented prior spiritual thoughts to be your own it only diminishes your credibility. I wish Tolle provided appropriate references - such as the Upanishads, the Gita, the Kashmir Shaivism, the Dhammapada and the Vigyana Bhairava Tantra - the first sutra of which documents the meditation technique of focusing on your breath and moving along with it minutely without falling behind or moving ahead - the idea is to discover the gap between pran (incoming breath) and apan (outgoing breath), this technique was used by Buddha for his enlightenment. Enlightenment means complete dissolution of the ego -not the refinement of it -- so when I see Tolle trying to pass this stuff as his own - it just takes away of his claim of being enlightened. Tolle regurgitates in verbally articulate manner spiritual gossip or as another reviewer put it a rather funny manner superficial ""Hippy-Dippy wisdom""."
2,Huh?,"Might be full of excellent information but my mind is NOT in a place to follow it and fully make use of it. To the seller's credit though, it came quickly and in perfect condition."
5,My present to you,"This review was written in the past. You are wasting your life by reading my words because it is 10:46pm on June 13, 2009. Obviously not the present."
2,Full of exercices,"If you succeed to read the entire book without feeling the pain of the boring repetition (instead, just noticing it!), then you undoubtedly have acquired the Power of Now explained in few pages."
2,The type of guy the Apostle Paul warned us about...,"This guy is a straight hustler, ala the carpetbaggers of the old West. Christians beware: Paul clearly warns us in 2 Timothy 3 to steer clear of nonsense like this. Just like we have to endure the ease and pleasure in this life, sometimes we may have to endure the pain and hardness as well. No one can truly predict when it will happen. But it is through endurance that we'll find salvation and strength. If you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ don't be hoodwinked by this New Age wordplay, you'll mess around and lose more than you stand to gain."
1,Truth?,"You really think this book is true just because someone else says so? Because the author spent 10 years toiling after what made HIMSELF happy? All he did was rip off buddhism and slap a new title on it. This book is not the way to joy. This book is not the way to live a life of meaningful relationships, and it's certanly not the way to feel good about yourself. What is your purpose here on this planet? Why are you here? For yourself? What kind of life is that? Living for yourself. Thats not a way to live. Don't get me wrong I am not condeming you for buying this book. No. What I am doing is asking you your motives. Why you are buying this book, and if you are sure you want to go on living a life this book wants you to lead. I urge you, ask yourself, ""Why do I do the things I do,"" and more importantly, ""who do I do them for?"""
5,Read This Book and Skip The Others,"This book is the most succinct, clear and profound presentation of fundamental spiritual truth that I have EVER read; and I have read a lot. There is no ego here, no fluff; only Truth as clear and resounding as a temple bell, stated in a gentle, practical and supremely accessible manner. If you want a sword that will cut through your illusions and confusions in one brilliant sweep, this is it. I also highly recommend the unabridged audiobook version--both the book and tapes bear repeated reading/listening/digesting."
5,the power of now,"Enlightenment is rarely a one-time experience, but rather is accomplished by degrees. The author has great clarity and the book communicates this consistently to readers, no matter their levels of understanding. This is an exceptional feat! The book simultaneously is extraordinarily readable by the reader, and able to be utilized readily for ones own growth. I find it not only helpful for myself, thus, but in relation to supporting others in their development. Subject matter of profound natures are communicated extraordinarily succinctly!Bravo, Eckhart Tolle!"
5,A book for skeptics.,"I admit it, I'm a scientific skeptic and annoyed by ""new age speak"" and unsubstantiated claims of spiritual powers and enlightenment. So when my girlfriend recommended I read Tolle's book about the ""now experience"", I was incredulous. However, I quickly realized Tolle's book in a category by its self. No grandiose claims, panacea remedies, or motivational empowerment here. His penetrating insights will make you STOP what you are doing, and I guess that's the point. The ""now awareness"" Tolle describes is available to everyone (new age seeker, or skeptic). My girlfriend and I have finally found common ground. If nothing else, it's a breath of sanity. Read it before you die."
5,Honestly changed my life,"This book really and truly has changed my life. If I had one personal item to take to a deserted island, this book would be my choice.I've read a lot of spiritually oriented books over the years, and I've gained much from them. After reading Eckhart's message in The Power of Now, I felt like ""this is really *it*""; no need to look anymore. I still feel that way, and I think that it's been around two years since I first read it. The external search for truth is finally over for me. His audio tapes & CD's are also excellent, and are always surprisingly fresh and new.I personally believe that Eckhart is one of a very few true masters to walk this Earth. Do yourself a favor and buy this book (& some of his tapes); you won't be sorry."
1,"""Nothingness""","I now know the definition of ""nothingness"". This book is it. Page after page of psycho-babel non-sense. I know those who read this will just say ""you just don't get it"". I would respond that is true, but only because there is nothing to get. Everything in Tolle's little world is subjective. If that is true then even words lose meaning. If the meaning of words are subjective, then why write a book to tell us everything is subjective? Tolle wrote this book and all the others for one reason - $$$$$$ Ka-ching."
1,Nothing new- avoid this at all costs,"I read this book because of all the hype. I found it very disappointing. He makes strange claims about energy and frequencies that make no sense. The entire book is just an overview of buddhism written by a white guy.If this topic interests you, then read some REAL buddhism, or better yet, go to a temple. I live in Toronto and there are literally dozens of temples here.Tolle is the kind of huckster that reads other peoples work and then writes a book claiming the ideas are something new and feels he is right because people who are looking for spiritual answers tell him he is. I don't think he is a ""con man"", but a lousy author with bad ideas that he has taken from other people.There are thousands of other books that handle these ideas much better. Please stop making guys like this rich."
4,"Well read, strange accent or recording","The book, ""The Power of Now"" is one of the most important books I have read (see my review of it) and I purchased these CDs to allow me to listen to it in the car.This recording is true to the book (read by the author, word-for-word), but his accent or the digital mastering make the first listen of it difficult. In time, one becomes used to it and it works well.Personally I prefer the reading the book, but I have lent the CDs to friends who have already read the book, and they have enjoyed the CDs more.If you've read the book and like the idea of having it in audio format, buy the CDs. If you haven't read the book and are wondering which version to get, get the book. If you won't read the book...but might listen to the CDs, then consider buying the CDs."
1,I'm so happy I got a library copy,"I am so happy I didn't buy this and was lucky enough to get almost all his works from our local library. Spiritual teaching that works for me does not have 300 ""me, my, mine, I"" references in the first 15 minutes of listening...and that was in the text not the forward. I will stick with the buddhist path."
2,Not complete,"I listened to this book on CD. At first I thought it was pretty good stuff until a woman basically asked Tolle, ""How do I use your teachings when I have overwhelming problems like debt, a son on drugs, going through a divorce, etc."" Tolle answered with in my opinion a nonanswer. I don't remember the exact words nor do I wish to but he basically said well I understand how difficult it is but just think in the now and everything will be okay. I think if you are into this stuff then you should read the stuff by J. Krishnamurti or even Dr. Wayne Dyer."
2,Waste of Money....Compiled from various sources....,"...and it's not even the ""best of"", sort of reference.My thoughts are, that this guy is potentially a cult figure, with followers who are grabbing at straws. I can't imagine what Oprah was thinking. Her original spiritual strengths, were strong enough to take her, further than most people can imagine going.2-stars is over-rating his books...in my book.My concern:Charlatans, exploiting those who may be needing real help."
2,there are better books for the spiritually inclined,"It seems true that if we remain in the present we will be happier and more at peace - energy won't be drained from regret or worry - but I sense there's more to enlightenment than that, and the author offers no actual instruction on how to achieve this end. There are better books out there for the spiritually inclined, like God Without Religion or God Talks With Arjuna."
2,Interesting,I was in San Francisco when I bought this book. I still haven't finished it. It's a little off the path for me. I will eventually finish it.
5,Recent order,I purchased this as a gift; and everything went smooth as silk. I would do it again should the situation arise.
4,"The first half excellent, then repetitive and boring","I think the first half of the book is excellent, and should everybody read it and take action. It is a reminder of some simple things in life. then it gets into relationships, repetitive and so. I guess if it has only half the pages i would give it 4 stars. I recommend it though, and i only recommended to two persons."
4,The power of now,"This book made me think again about how to embrace what ""is"". I recommend this book to those who are searching for peace. It is difficult to live unconsciously and I strive to move out of fear and anxiety."
5,Make the most of the present moment,"Eckhardt Tolle discusses the value of staying in the present moment in a gentle, soulful and helpful manner. No-one can deny the importance of being fully present! I found this book interesting and recommend you read it along with Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self. You will know how to be your best in the present moment and throughout your life when you read these books."
4,Excellent book - get to David Icke!,"The first 5 chapters of this book are amazing. The biblical reference turn me off, but everything else seems to ring true.If you're looking for another book that goes one step further than this one, try ""Tales from the Time Loop"" by David Icke. Icke picks up where this book stops...!"
5,self & world become a source of joy,"""The Power of Now"" offers many ultra-powerful techniques for improving one's experience of self & the world. Greater than that, it shares a perspective from which one's self & world become a source of joy. This is enlightenment.Personally, after trying both, I prefer the audio-tapes to the book. Read by Eckhart, they are soothing and take you though the text with the intended tone.Enjoy."
4,A wonderfully simple idea described with too many words,"The idea is simple yet immensely powerful. Living in the ""Now"", the ""present"". I've tried, and yes a lot of life's problems can be solved. If God gave us messages, this message would be one of them. On the other hand, maybe it was God who made Mr. Tolle give this message to us. It is so true and so powerful. However, this book would be even more powerful if it was half the length it currently is, and if it was written more simply. The message itself attains its power from its simplicity, so why not make the delivery of the message as simple as possible too? That is why I have suggested Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch in addition or insetad of this book which contains such powerful messages in such a simplistic voice which is the sign of a Godly message. As a sidenote: I am very impressed by Mr. Tolle's powerful experience that led him from suffering to where he is today. It truly helped me understand what he meant in the book."
4,Good but would recommend A New Earth first.,"I read this AFTER I read his book A New Earth. So, I liked this book but got more out of the other. I would recommend you start there (A New Earth). But, I will say that the ""power of now"" concept (it's in both books) COMPLETELY changed my life the second I read it. You start right now implementing the concepts because that is all you have! So simple and logical - I guess that is why the general population is missing it...people are always trying to make things so complicated. One of the best things I noticed was an instantaneous change in my children's behavior! Nothing can put a price on that!"
1,"A preview, not a guide",Stephen Hawking solves complex mathematical formulas to understand the universe. Simple?Many people have been introduced to the present thanks to The Power of Now. How many of them will experience the present?This book gives little guidance. It is a collection of vignettes that illustrate how an enlightened person might act in given situations. I expected more of 'this is how you get there' than 'this is how you will be.'
2,overgeneralized,"AS a long time student of meditation practice, I found Tolle' book too often offering overgeneralizations that don't fit. His section on couples and relationships is so idealistic as to be unrealistic. He makes many excellent points, but misses others. I do not doubt his experience(s), but his explanations leave one wanting too often. For what it purports to be, I was disappointed in this book. Too often , ""self enlightened"" teachers misinterpret their very real experiences and mislead the eager reader or student. Pema Chodron is a better source for those seeking to learn of self realization and it's implications in every day life."
3,This book will only work for you in theory...,"So I thought this book was very interesting, but heres the thing... Unless you practice his techniques as much as a monk does, it will not do anything special for you. Enlightenment is near impossible to achieve in this society. If you are reading this because you want to simply educate yourself on the topic of enlightenment, than this is a great book to read. If you are looking to this book to actually enhance your life in anyway, than i beleive you need to look elsewhere, enlightenment is nearly impossible to acheive."
2,"Not wise for spiritual betterment, no actual substance","This book is not for anyone who is below a certain echelon of spiritual enlightenment, which is relatively high. It can induce a veiled apathy which is dangerous towards the true lessons learned in one's life.It is almost nihilistic in its attitude towards reality, this guy is RATHER egotistical, and although I do not doubt his spiritual path, he fails to see the VAST variety of paths which one can choose towards enlightenment. Save your money."
5,Best book Ever,"This is one book that I will always treasure. It has changed my life for the better. Everyone needs to read this book and listen to the audio Cd's. I read the book and than got the audio books. The audio Cd's helped so much. If you only read one book this year,read this book. It is a important book. NOW is all there is and all there will ever be."
3,Helpful for getting out of the past,"This will guide you into the Now and away from the past. I found some of it rather ""spirity"" rather than spiritual, but the basic idea is wonderful. Some of it actually helps you fight out of the trap we put ourselves in. Pass it along."
1,Nothing new here,"There's nothing new here, but if you get something out of this classic premise of being in the moment, that's great. I think the now-classic WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOU ARE title by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a much better take on this important Zen topic."
1,Couldn't force myself to go any further...,"I could only get 40 pages into this book and had to give up. I just don't know what to say. Buzzwords abounded but didn't really mean anything. It is a thick soup of spiced up phrases and ideas, but I don't really think they mean anything. Reading a paragraph in this book is tough and the mind wanders from the lack of focus and meaning. I don't see how this could help anyone in their own life. Hmmm....Just a frustrating book and IMO a waste of my money and time (well 40 pages worth anyway.) Would NOT recommend this book."
1,Drivel,"I really cannot understand what the big deal is about this book. People tend to get almost a religious fanaticism about this book. I found it trite and condescending. If you are a critical thinker, steer clear. If you are looking for a feel-good ""all-my-problems-are-now-solved"" book, by all means, carry on."
3,listen closely,"i have mixed emotions about this product.i love the message, but i am not crazy about the messenger.excellent teachings and advice. the problem is they got the author to read it. maybe they should have gone with an actor or a singer.the author's voice is an annoying monotone and it has little to no projection to it. this makes it difficult to understand what he is saying and i have to crank my cd player up and often rewind to listen to parts i couldn't understand the first time through. this can be annoying and disrupts any continuity in listening.again-i love the message, but perhaps this item is best if dealt with in a book format."
2,Great material - bad presentation,"Although I agree with the message, I am not a fan of Tolle's writing. He's too ""rambly"" and esoteric for me. I had to force myself to finish."
3,The Power of Now,The book was ok for the reason it was written. A lot of it I couldn't seem to understand but not bad.
4,The Power is Now!,"Eckhart Tolle doesn't disappoint with this book. As a ""new ager"" I found it added to what I already believe. Great book!"
5,life enlightening,"Buy the book, read it and find out how to change your life, or at least start to see how things could be different. It is written like a ""book for dummies"". He is brilliant."
3,Okay but found other Mindfulness better written,"I understand that Eckhart Tolle is the 'guru' but quite frankly I found this book lacking in practical application of the Power of Now and Mindfulness. I've read several other Mindfulness books by Jon Kabat-Zinn and Mark Williams. I found these to be far better at giving pratical advice on the practice of Mindfulness and applying this to the Now. I give this an 'Okay' rating, but you need to read 'The Mindful Way Through Depression' and 'Mindfulness A practical guide to Finding Peace in Frantic World' to get lessons on how to apply Mindfulness techneques to achieve the Power of Now."
5,Spectacular,"I first got these cd's at the library. I was so impressed with Mr. Tolle's spiritual teachings that I was led to purchase the audio cds immediately. I listen to them on my way to work and back home again. It is so enlightening and explains so much why we feel and do the crazy things we do. I feel priviledged to have been able to listen and learn from this wonderful presentation. Mr. Tolle's voice is so peaceful and grounded that I enjoy more listening to him read the book on cd then reading it myself, which I have done also. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking true spirituality and the disciplining of their mind."
5,Path to Peace,"To take such a beautiful and simple concept - being in the present tense - and build a philosophy of living around it shakes down the Western desire to complicate. Reading the book is calming and following Eckhart's guidelines for how to live in the now is even more calming! What a simple, yet life-transforming concept and book.A must for anyone struggling with the mind created complexities of modern living. It unravels the web of self-destructive behavior and thinking and lights a clean path to personal peace."
5,The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,This is an amazing book. It really helps one to focus and cut through all the unimportant clutter in life. I've started reading this book for the second time within one month. It's very heavy reading so it may be easier for some to order the audio version. Within the first twenty or so pages into the book I had read such transformative information that I felt as light hearted and happy as when I was a child without a care in the world.
2,Half-way up the mountain?,"Does Eckhart Tolle really think he is enlightened, and can lead people to that place? Very, very doubtful. Good for him, he received some grace when he was in a depressed state, and had a mystical experience - but it's quite a leap to believe this is enlightenment. His words certainly don't have that ring to it - they are often confused, vague, overly verbose, and smacking of the kind of arrogance which typifies much of modern-day 'spirituality' coming out of the West (e.g., Wilber and Cohen). I wouldn't be surprised if things changed for Mr Tolle once the stage he is currently in has passed, if he's lucky. Still, I do think this book contains some good advice, and would probably be an excellent gateway into spiritual realms for 'beginners'. Just take it with a pinch of salt..."
2,No Not Another Book Telling Me How To Be A Better Person,Eckhart Tolle is the flavor of the moment. Fear not--wait a few months and a new flavor will make its way on to the scene.
5,Good mental and spiritual health,"THE POWER OF NOW guides the reader to value and practice living (breathing, thinking, acting) in the present. Gradually, as a person practices living in the present, painful memories and taunting thoughts are gently healed and the person is more free to experience the moment in which he/she is living. Also, living in the NOW prepares the person to deal with the future.I believe that the practice of living in the present moment is a way of putting into practice the teaching offered by Christ in the gospels: be sure of your value as a person fashioned by a loving Creator, trust the Creator to be with you NOW and at every now. In my mind this implies that living in the present moment we won't miss our Creator and we live out the trust that we were accompanied in the past and will be accompanied in the future by our loving, challenging Creator."
1,Ugh.,This book is awful. It is boring and gives poor advice. Why does anyone need a book to learn how to live their lives anyways?
1,Oprah Hype,"Have you ever been disappointed by a book that Oprahrecommended? Well, don't be fooled again. I am anormal person of at least average intelligence. Ienjoy reading spiritual books, but this one is ridiculous!I tried several times to sit down and focus on this bookand I felt like I was reading a bunch of gibberish.Returned a copy to [a competitor's bookstore] today and the cashiertold me that a lot of people hate this book."
1,Ruining Lives,"This is a horrible book. Bibi Jones claims this book is the reason she retired. I strongly urge females to stay away from this book and stick to better books like 50 Shades. Great job Eckhart, you ruined my summer."
3,The Power of Now,I enjoyed this book very much. Living in the moment is such an important concept which we don't do in this day and age. This book helps ground that out nicely. The book was easy to read and progressed nicely. One book that I think would complement this book beautifully is The Lost Teachings of Atlantis by Jon Peniel. It continues where this book leaves off. I recommend both.
4,Path of Happiness 'Live Now',"A simple yet powerful message by Ekhart Tolle's - Live Now, live with the Present and you remain sailing on the sea of life. The author packs it with lots of infomation, messages floating with a clear, enthusiastic voice focusing on enlightened life, creativity and live genuinely in peace and happiness.It's a masterpiece of a new generation leaving behind the traumas of pain, suffering and adopting the method of staying 'afloat' n survive. The book has Eastern and Western spiritual teaching influence. Tolle believes in 'self', the true conscious living and not only believing in 'God'The Power of Now is living the 'Present' and accepting the 'I' as Arthur Deikman puts it, which is identical to awareness and one who is aware, Now is realised - So is this true. I recommend this book as a Spiritual self trainer to 'Let-go' off the pain n suffering and leave behind the scars to live in Present."
3,Rise above being present,"I was not excited by this book because I learned about witnessing emotions and thoughts (instead of letting them controlled me)30 years ago. Tolle recommends being present which is also nothing new. If you are really interested in experiencing your best self and making the most of your life, read Optimal Thinking, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. They give you down-to-earth tools and take you above touchy feeling mumbo jumbo."
1,don't waste the money,"Bought it on basis of recommendation by a friend of the book, spend a lot of time commuting so thought the CD would be ideal, read some of the glowing reviews and decided to try it. Maybe I'm just a redneck with prejudices, but I had a terrible time understanding the Teutonic accent, and his microphone-voice combo results in rather smeared sound which is quite impossible to understand. Turned out to be a waste of my money."
2,Buddha on a Low Fat Diet,"Two problems with this book:First, you have to have an inclination towards this type of Zen non-thinking - for most Westerners this is a radical shift from our goal oriented, materialistic orientation.The second problem with this book is that even if you are so inclined, other authors have articulated the ""no mind"" subject matter in ways that are far superior to this Zen for Dummies approach.Essentially, Tolle spits out one tiny pearl of Hippy-Dippy wisdom and then yammers on and on, ad nauseum for the next 200 pages. Christ! It was like listening to my mother-in-law tell the same story, a hundred different ways. zzzzzzzz. Personally, I found this a tedious read.I'd recommend the works of D.T. Suzuki, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Carlos Casteneda or Charles Tart for the serious aspirant. In my opinion, The Power of Now can wait a little longer."
1,Sample,"The sample only allows you to view the ""opening credits"" and one page of the intro. How can you tell if you want to buy the book?"
2,.,"You don't need to buy the book, for the answers are not there. All you need to do is-Be in the moment."
3,Deep insight,"I read a little bit of this book. It goes to a very deep level and it was to deep for my liking. Some readers might like it, but I think it takes a certain amount of understanding to know the message he is expressing. He tries to break it down but I still had to ask others what he meant. He talks more about the subsconsious mind. A bit confusing for me, but others may like it.Thanks,Sara Omaha, NE."
4,Great Book,"Eckhart Tolle in this book comes across as really knowing his stuff. This is a hard topic to write on and an even harder thing to pick up use in our lives. Eventhough sometimes its a little nebulous,anyone who is interested in sprititual growth should read this at some point.thanks for reading my review and I wish you luck"
4,"Lacks balance, but a really great book for gaining/developing Consciousness.","There's a lot to gain from Tolle's words. I've learned a lot from this book. With that said, this work is not perfect. What I did not like is that the book does very little to offer, explain the importance of having BALANCE in life. There is a great deal of fun, laughter, and happiness to be experienced in (physical)life, and pushing it aside to constantly check for or to live through a filter of Spiritual Identity will not bring about those experiences.I most strongly agree with G. Fishman's Amazon review titled ""Very powerful, but don't take it TOO seriously"". Fishman does a better job at explaining what I want to/can't/won't."
1,If I could give this book a -100 stars I would!,"Eckhart Tolle and others who preach this new age spirituality are dangerous. His teachings afford people the opportunity to deny their wrongdoings and hurtful acts to others and gives them a pass to do what makes them happy without regards to other people, their needs and feelings.If Eckhart Tolle is such a spiritual man, why is he charging people money to read and hear his misleading practices? Beware and don't fall for this. Also, don't line the pockets of an individual who is leading many people astray. Many thanks to Oprah Winfrey for unleashing this fake spiritual fraud on others.This crap only works if everyone in a house is willing to fall for it. Echkart Tolle ruined my marriage, my idiot husband fell for it. If you want to be unhappy, follow his teachings."
2,Good info - terrible voice,"I started falling asleep within two seconds of the author starting to speak, and it just goes on, and on, and on. It's so monotonous at times it sounds like the artificial 'voice box'.It's unfortunate, because there's some real wisdom in those words. This should be abridged and read by someone else and then it'd be truly valuable.Note, I'm only referring to the Audio CD version. I still think everyone could benefit from the information presented here."
1,Wish I could say that I liked it...,"I actually purchased two copies of this book afterhearing Oprah Winfrey rave about it on one of herrecent shows... (""If you only read one book thisyear, make sure it's this one!"")Sadly, I have to agree with the other reviewerswho were disappointed with it...Eckhart Tolle does make one good point -- that itcan be truly refreshing to ""step away from"" yourselfmentally, and spend some time ""observing"" yourselfand your life circumstances objectively...But then he spends roughly another 200 pagesrestating the same point over and over...A much better book on this very topic is titled""Shadow Syndromes,"" by John J. Ratey, MD, aresearcher and psychiatrist...His book goes into goes into the actual mechanicsof the mind, and does a much better job explainingthe technique of mentally ""observing yourself""when you want to break the grip of an unhealthymind-set...I would read that book, before I'd readthis one..."
4,great gift for a friend,know someone looking for spiritual enlightenmentget them this booka very moving insight about introspection and self awarenessa real soul opener
1,It could be the voice,"Perhaps the materials would have been better as written words, but I listened to part of this audio CD during my long commutes. The introduction was simultaneously pretentious and unremarkable. Many of the points he makes are at least 1500 years old. I don't mind the repetition, but he barely acknowledges his ancient sources.Then, there's the voice. His voice is slow, soft, melodic, carefully modulated to suggest wisdom and authority, like that of a man who takes himself far too seriously.My cult-o-meter was hitting orange alert levels, so I returned the CDs to the store.18 Jan 2009 PS: Read the comments for this review. I may have been a little too harsh."
4,"A great book, even with all that God stuff in it.","I consider myself a devout athiest and was not expecting much more than another ""live in the moment"" book, when a friend recommended The Power of Now. Being a perfectly content person already, I didn't think it would have much to offer me. In fact it gave me a lot to think about. Tolle makes a lot of very insightful observations about how the human mind works and the frustration we create for ourselves. He loses me whenever he starts talking about Being and how we're all connected to everything, but that doesn't get in the way of understanding the rest. He loses a star for too often using a weak metaphore as though it were evidence of his point. Although I'm not sure that he was really trying to prove his point, rather just trying to explain how he sees the world and let the readers decide for themselves. Either way, a very worthwhile read."
5,Having the Power right Now,"Your greatest Power is right Now in the moment. It is not in the future or in the past. If you desire to create / attract what is required in your Life, and be empowered to do so. This is the book that will give you that understanding. But then you must choose to live it.Al Diaz / Authorwww.theonlyoption.net"
1,All you need to know,"All you need to know about Eckhart Tolle is that he has been struggling with depression for most of his life. Every few years he will come out of it and be in a mania for several months, where he will write. The reason that his writings are so odd, vague, incoherent, mystical, fanatical, etc., is that that is how a manic person thinks. It is no wonder that many people feel good when they read Tolle's work; he is writing in a state of mania, which is a very energetic, invigorating felling, and this is the psychology he communicates to his audience. However, it must not be trusted, and the fact that mania is a pleasurable, feel good state, has absolutely no bearing on its truth value. He is psychologically unstable. He is no person to give spiritual advice."
1,hazed over glaze on a chia pet,"I really dont think this book is all it is cracked up to be. It just seems too repetitive and never really gets down the whole point in a way that is understandable for most humans. I am in a class right now and we are using this book for a guide, and I will say that everyone in the class would probably agree with me. There is too much fluffy info and it lacks a tride and true method of some sort. When I read this book, I feel like I am starring into a deep space hole or something. I am all about the power of the so called now...but this book sucks... I would suggest reading something by Lama Surya Das if you are interested in this sort of thing... at least his books are interesting and they dont repeat the same things over and over in the most ambigous way..."
3,Should I drop everything?,"Another one of those ""spiritual enlightenment"" books then. This one seems better than most, since it emphasises the present, as opposed to past lives or predicting the future. On the other hand, it's all very well to talk about ""now"" as the best time to seize the moment, etc. but what about people who don't have the option? It's like taunting them; they feel like they're missing out, while everyone is talking about how great ""now"" is. ""Now"" is the latest thing - get yours before it's too late. Talking about ""spiritual enlightenment"" at all is always a bit iffy too - it can be a bit like an exclusive club catering to people's need for belonging. I wouldn't necessarily accuse this book of that, however. In fact I wouldn't accuse it of much at all, since I haven't read it and have no intention of doing so. It's just not my kind of thing, although I did read an Alan atts book once..."
2,Not inspiring for me,"I'm almost afraid to write what I really think because I've found that Eckart Tolle readers tend to be a bit on the rabid side. One of the things he teaches is that if you don't buy into his philosophies it is just because you are ""not ready"" as if he and everyone else is so much wiser and more mature than you. I find that quite arrogant. While there are many things to praise in this book (certainly living in the now is a noble endeavor) I just couldn't get past this all knowing superiority complex the man seems to have. Yeah, I know Oprah loves him but that doesn't mean everyone has to.One thing that disturbs me is that so many Christians seem to take offense at his words. I'm wondering if they are threatened by his logic. Have they really read the book, or is it just a knee jerk reaction to anything that isn't biblical?In any case, some people may really enjoy and be inspired by this work, I just wasn't one of them."
1,One more NEW AGE fad,"This new fad, like many others, might fool you for a while. ""After all that searching, I finally found the answer"". Just try it for six months and see for yourself if it really works. But do you really think there is a way you can live only in the present? I mean, really. What are you going to do? Get rid of part of your brain that stores memory and experiences?When the author compares the reality of a Cat to that of a human I thought the author was joking. Of course a Cat doesn't worry, a female dog doesn't complain, and the frog is always relaxed! Their reality is much simpler than ours!You can try and see if this is your ""spiritual path"" but remember if you always live in the present you might forget you are enlightened! Tricky, hum?"
4,"I'd give it 5 stars, but keep thinking perfect book is yet...","This book is not for folks who consider themselves too brilliant to learn anything new... It's definitely not for those who live based on past performance or results.For myself, it was the best thing I could find when I found it. Reading it, was the most therapeutic exercise I've ever had in learning to deal with circumstances that are outside of one's control, and finding moments of happiness and peace again. RI_Maam"
5,Life Changing!,"Tolle is a master with words. This book is both poignant, philosophical and approachable. It shows the sacredness of life and of our own nature. It teaches us in both peotic and simple language how to fully connect to our experiences and make life more authentic, exciting and free. This book is the beginning and the way to the liberation. It changed my life.[...]"
2,Has some good points,"I'm a complete atheist (or very materialistic, as my dad likes to call me). This applies not only to traditional one-God religions, but to all spiritual teachings, including Tolle's. I believe that almost any spiritual book has good points, and if you read it attentively, you can distill them for yourself, and just ignore everything else. Such is the case with this work. There are certainly great ideas here - don't live too much in the past or the future, but instead try to focus on what you're doing now and don't resent it, and so on. But all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo (sorry) of feeling the Being within yourself just passes me by. Like other reviewers have said, Tolle's instructions on how to feel the Being in you aren't clear enough for me. I understand that such is that nature of the experience, but I pretty much believe that he has undergone a profound spiritual change that cannot really be taught to others."
1,Tolle Translates Jesus to fit his belief,"Pass on this book. I started out reading it - thinking this guy had something to offer us all. Instead, the farther I got into the book, I discovered that Tolle has translated the parables of Jesus to fit his particular reality. This is absurd. How can ANYONE profess to know what Jesus ""actually"" meant by his parables. How did Tolle obtain this divine enlightenment? Again, it is absurd. In essence, Tolle is offering HIMSELF as a prophet. The fact that he's making millions of dollars from this book is a joke on us. He certainly is profiting on his ability to twist the bible to fit his greed. It is slanted toward Christians. Avoid this nonsense and just Live in the present and don't dwell on the past. It doesn't take a book to show you how to do this. Maybe a paragraph or a poem would suffice."
1,Terrible,"I have been a student of the Tao for several years and have a general understanding of Eastern thought, but it seems that Mr. Tolle just skipped any actual study and went straight for the book.Let me put it this way, anybody who says they have achieved enlightenment has not, and anybody who is enlightened would not publish a self help book."
2,says alot about little,Easier to speculate and philosophise than to actually live it in real. Hello what about real life?
1,completely unoriginal,Appears to be a rehash of the writings of J.Krishnamurti without his intelligence or subtlety.
1,The Power of Nothing,I do not recommend it. Looks like he has taken many world religions and tried to mesh them all together to sound like a smart mans wisdom.Falls short in many areas. Read the book twice to see if I was missing something. Do NOT waste your money if you have common seance. I gave it a 1 star because that was the lowest I could give.The book reads like a collage drop out on drugs trying to make a fast buck.Read the real King James version of the Bible and you will understand that this book is HOG wash! If you think this book enlightens you than you scare us all And you are one of the spooky ones!
2,not all that inspiring,"I was recommended this book by an acquaintance. I thought it would have something new or at least intriguing to offer, but I was disappointed. I couldn't even get past the first chapter. It was dry and unoriginal."
4,Deeply powerful book - but it's just the beginning,"I read this book about six months ago and was very profoundly affected. I then gave it to my husband and a close friend, and they were profoundly affected. It resonated very deeply and left a quiet, peaceful influence that lasted for quite some time.However, in retrospect, I see it was just the beginning. The author implies that the only thing we need to do become enlightened or release us from our problems is to be in the Now, but I believe it is more involved than that. I did find myself reaching states of peace by being in the Now, but eventually I found myself asking, Now What?"
1,I hope that Mr. Tolle comes back as a 12-year-old girl ...,"...Then he can experience the menstrual cycle firsthand and may not be so enamored of it. There's nothing like getting in touch with your inner goddess while curled into a ball in bed. And agonizing cramps do indeed make you ''present''! Trust me, you don't dwell in the future or the past when the menses descend.Honestly, can anyone get through this book without laughing aloud at certain points? I do not denigrate the search for spirituality, but never before have I heard it delivered by someone so humorless and pompous. Pass me the Midol..."
4,The Power of NOW,"I thought that this book was well written. It takes you through a step by step journey to understand the real power of just putting yourself, mind and body in the present, the "" NOW ""."
4,Tolle's The Power of NOW,"This is my least favorite of his books ... only because I don't care for the question and answer style. AND that said, it is a clear guide to why and how to be in the NOW. It responds to all the questions one's mind can imagine ... and then some. And I have to admit, when I finished, there were no more questions in my little pea brain."
4,Repetitive at times but I guess is just press his point,"As you would notice if you follow the more than thousand reviews of this book, there is no shortage of admirers and a few detractors with whom I also agree. There is no book in this planet whose words provide an infallible recipe for happiness or in which you might not find contradictory statements. As much as I agree with Mr. Eckhart that in many occasions labels of right and wrong for the situations of your life are originated by a severe lack of insight, I still fail to see how a person can operate in life without a sense of identity or ""ego"". I guess the book would be more convincing with less biblical references (after all that book is responsible for a lot of unhappiness in this world) and a more direct recognition that as long as we exist trouble will be a companion which his teachings can only ease but never eliminate."
1,Pompous waste of time,"The quotation at the front of the book says it all. How many serious authors quote themselves? And the body of the book is just as ridiculous. I have read many translations and commentaries on Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian philosophy, including the Dhammapada, Bhagavad Gita, and The Cloud of Unknowing. This guy's philosophy is essentially a mash-up of everything that has come before, but his writing style is so pedantic and self-congratulatory, it's a slog to get through it. Read the original thinkers and skip this pretender."
2,Not For Me,"I didn't connect with the book. There is some good advice here about living in the moment, but it was a chore for me to read. Check it out in a library or brick and morter store first to see if it's for you."
4,This is all good...,"...but soon into the book I knew what he was saying and couldn't even make myself go forward. It was like reading old news of what I had already gone through and established on my own. Fabulously wise and helpful information the author sets forth - so it is not my intent that my review is to diminish the author, book, or its content in any way. That was simply my experience."
1,How Many Times Can You Say NOW?,"Okay so it did make me realize that all we have is the NOW and not to worry too much about the future but how many times do you have to hear him say that in a 1,000 different ways?"
4,The Power of Now,"I find this book to be informative, stimulating and inspiring. As I read more each day, I am learning how to use the techniques provided to achieve the desired result. The experience is rewarding.I thank the seller for accomodating my special request, and will look for him/her again when I make future purchases on Amazon."
5,Super job.,Great job! I received the book very quickly and it was in excellent condition. Thank you!
4,It can help!,"'THE POWER OF NOW' instructs you to focus on a single item at a time vs. being scattered in thought, action or emotion. This approach to life will help you obtain fulfillment and peace of mind. This seems like common sense, but the book reminds you of the things whicht are important and how to handle daily life.The author repeats the same thing over and over in this book. I then realized it was necessary in order to have people obtain the correct mind-set. If you haven't read this book by Tolle, my advice is do so."
2,"Sounds good in theory, near impossible in practice","This book at first glance is seductive, but the more I read, the more it sounded like a new age version of Buddhism.Perhaps, the author found enlightenment (or at least he thinks he did), but I don't think the exercises in this book are going to help 99% of the readers.In Buddhism, there are similar tales of sudden enlightenment, but people who can attain enlightenment that way are very rare.In Buddhism, there are also many stories of people who think they are enlightened who are not. They have one shallow enlightenment experience, and they think they are fully enlightened but are not. Not that I am necessarily saying this about the author, but people who are enlightened don't usually go around announcing it. They look and act like normal people.This book has some good ideas. Like I said before, it is the new age version of Buddhism. Also, the author's assertions about other religions are sometimes erroneous."
4,time related conditioning,"If you are after the spiritual enlightenment, this is a good book, written very clearly.It focuses on the time related conditioning in human mind and its costly results.If you like to go into deep meditative states in this subject including almost all aspects of spiritual enlightenment,then I would highly recommend The Universal Mysteries by Ahmed Hulusi."
1,What do people SEE in this book or the author???,"Don't even go here. Start with Thich Nhat Hanh's The Miracle of Mindfulness (and indeed anything by him), some Suzuki, the Dalai Lama's The Art of Happiness if you want something more topical. These are true philosophers, people who came by their wisdom over a lifetime of study, and the books are as clear and simple as can be. If you're dealing with depression and want to use mindfulness (or the NOW as this pompous creep relabeled this ancient practice) to help center yourself, there's a terrific new book, The Mindful Way through Depression, that is written by individuals with the education and experience to combine psychology with eastern philosophy. Sitting on a park bench after some sort of meltdown does not a spiritual teacher make. This is probably the most irritating book I've ever tried to read."
1,Falsely sold as new!!,"The description for this book was new and it most certainly was not. Through out this book there was writing, highlights, and dog ears. I will not be purchasing from Traci-Lee's collectibles again."
5,"If you want to be a Finder, instead of a continual Seeker","For those that are ready to quit reading about enlightenment, and are ready to actually experience a taste of it-- this is the book. Instead of dogma, you get actual teachings and tools- that work!-in EXPERIENCING what we all hunger for. Presence, peace, connection to the Divine. As far as 'spiritual books' go, I've read them all, and none give me as many 'aha' moments as The Power of Now. And they continue to come, even as I re-read it time and time again. There is almost a transmission of the state that Tolle speaks of. Buy this book. Buy two, because you will want to share it."
1,Misleading,"It is not the worst book I have read by any means in this area, There are a few others maybe four. Tolle takes the idea of living in the now which is a very common and old idea, as if he just found it by himself and it is his idea. Then he writes a book about it copying the title from another book which uses the same words "" the power of now"".Very clever as it is so eyecatching. However having read other books in the same vein this book totally confuses itself in its eagerness to promise so much. No wonder its a best seller. Thank goodness I was too far down the spiritual path and not a complete beginner to get caught up in its hooks and traps."
2,"Verbose, Disappointing",This book is verbose and disappointing. Not enough substance surrounded by a lot of expensive adjectives and adverbs.
2,Only as good as the movie,"As the movie is to the Wertmüller original, so this soundtrack'smusic pales compared to the beauty of Piccioni's score.Get the soundtrack of the original film, if you can find it.This is just typical Hollywood muzak."
4,Very nice shovel,"This is a high quality item. Light actually reflects from the surface of the shovel, very beautiful craftsmanship. The handle is quite sturdy. The only improvement I would make, is to make the handle a little longer. Even though I am not tall, I thing an extra couple of inches would make this shovel more comfortable to use. Will pass this on to one of the kids."
5,"Great Product, exact fit for my toyota camry","Monroe did an awesome job with putting an entire kit together, makes replacing them very easy. After driving 200k on the factory suspension these make a huge difference in the car handling and ride quality."
1,Doesn't not fit Camry 2002,I bought this one to replace the old strut on my Toyota Camry LE 4cyc. I checked both Monroe and Amazon website to make sure it fits (as they say it does). Got it and found out it does not fit. Contacted the seller and they are ok to take it back for refund. BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR THE COST OF SHIPMENT AND IT COSTED ME $45.I got one strut from Amazon and it does not fit I also return it and it was free to ship the package back.So disappointed with this purchase.
1,Poor Quality,"One of 3 bolts on top of the frond left strut broke into half when I was tightening it with a very small torque, and made what should be an one-hour work became three. I brought all 4 Monroe Quick Complete Assembly for my Camry 1999 (frond- rear, left-right), the one gave me hard time was the frond left, but I may well put this review for all 4 of them, since 1 out of 12 bolts broken is a very high ratio."
1,Didn't Fit - The Catalog is wrong.,I ordered these and they don't fit the car. Now I'm stuck because the parts are too expensive to ship back. Hopefully I can sell to someone locally. The price you pay for living on an island...
3,More Poor Quality Control,"The unit was easy enough to install and make a big difference in ride and handling. However, after about 200 miles or less I began to hear a LOUD rattle from under the hood. I finally figured out the nut on the strut shaft had loosened, a lot. After several calls to Monroe Customer Service I was told to re-torque the nut to 50 ft/lbs. CS said that the nut should not have loosened. The exact same thing happened to a Monroe Quick Strut that I installed on my wife's Camry. Really poor quality control. Shame on you Monroe. These things are not inexpensive either."
4,A bit noisy over bumps,"I put the quick-strut on a 1997 Camry with no problem other than needing to really torque the lower bolts to keep the shock from moving when going over bumps causing an extra squeak. I have not had them on long enough to say anything about their durability. They are definitely noisier than the stock shocks. I am hoping they quiet down as they break in. The price was great, so I bought American."
4,Complete Strut Assembly makes it easy,"I bought 4 new strut assemblies for my 2000 Toyota Camry. I had my 2 mechanics install them on my vehical and it took about 20 minutes for each assembly. They did have problems with the right rear strut because it was not assembled correctly from the factory. They discovered that the unit was not torque to specs, but they made short of the problems and I was on the road again. Torque specs are given with the assembles, so make sure you check that the nuts are correctly torqued before you install the unit. This will save you time when installing the unit on the car. The price was right, and the shipping was free. I could not beat the price locally."
5,Very reasonable and easy to install,Total installation including jacking up the car and removing the tires took about 2 hours. These quick struts were super easy to install and perform great. My car is quiet again!
5,ginkgo demitasse spoons - good value,I am very pleased with these little spoons; they're very well made and the price was very good. I have a whole set of flatwarethat matches these little spoons. I like them so much I'm considering ordering the small forks.
3,Quality spoons for kids' lunch boxes,I bought them because they were cheap. But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality -- they are pretty and feel substantial. They are small and perfect for kids to take to school and eat fruit cups with.
2,Look and feel cheap,"Poor quality, I will not buy them again. They are also small (as demitasse indicates) - so watch out for that."
2,"Deceptively titled, tinfoil-hat-brigade strident, sadly out of date!","Buy anything else but this. I wanted to build a retreat, and I knew more than this guy. If you want good info, go to Survivalblog.com. If you spend money here, you won't get your necessary info, you won't learn much but you will feel rooked. The state of the art has moved on considerably since this was written, and all (and I mean ALL) of the info here is now free on the net. Any unique insights this tome might have once contained are now open source knowledge. If you want to build something, get a book on construction. If you want to be randomly flailed with disconnected facts and common knowledge, this is your stop! I'd have revised this ten years ago, and then again a couple of years ago to keep it current - this was just sad."
2,Fantastic reference book but...,the first 70 pages or so were put in upside down! What a bummer. I suppose I'll get used to reading upside down and backwards.
1,Not a skousen fan,"This overpriced, poorly written book is full of information thats in the public domain, that offers no new ideas on securing a home, and enjoys far too much acclaim from people who don't want to bother to learn anything for themselves.I was very disappointed in Mr. Skousens books. Happily, I was able to resell them at a profit, again to people who didn't want to bother to learn anything for themselves."
3,Less useful than it appears,"First, the good: there is a lot of info and it is possible to get something useful out of it. The bad: the author's claim to fame is ""Skousen wall"" and it does not work terribly well and the whole idea is less than it looks. Here is what I mean: first, 3 1/2"" thick wall is complete garbage, will not stop even 7.62 x 39 round at all. The thicker wall MIGHT, but there are serious drawbacks. First, tactical: author uses 3/4"" plywood as outer layer which is not at all fire resistant, and fire resistance is more important than ballistic resistance, in my opinion. Second, cost: 6"" wall with 3/4"" plywood face cost as much (or more) as solid concrete, and it is much less useful than concrete. The only possible benefit I see is in OPSEC (one can fill the wall from inside the house with no one to notice. But even this is less useful than it seems: if first building inside walls (by a contractor), the extra 6"" wide empty space around the basement wall is sure to raise questions."
5,great,"the longest book i have ever read,has allot of detail and although i dont agree with absolutely everything the author thinks, but he emphasis that it is his opinion"
1,Hostile Customer Service,"Gyration is now RCA/Thompson, and my experience of their customer service was so hostile and unresponsive that you really have to experience it to believe it. I even tried calling back to get a new service representative and got two out of two phone 'droids with no knowlege of the product other than a script, no desire to serve their customers, and a seeming directive from management to discourage repeat business. Both reps refursed to connect me with a supervisor. Perhaps there's a reason that RCA has such a terrible reputation in the trade. Always buy from reputable businesses, since your product is only as good as their inclination to stand behind it."
3,Good mouse and keyboard...range is only 15 ft max,Great mouse and keyboard...bought it because my TV is 20 feet from the couch...unfortunately this product does not achieve its stated range (expect no more than 15 feet).The battery life on the keyboard is excellent (read as ~6 months of continuous use)...but the mouse only lasts ~2 hours between charges.Good product...but with range and charge limitations.
2,Doesn't accomodate all sizes of butter sticks!,"I bought one of these only to find that it won't fit the sticks of butter we have here in the west. I think it be a cool product if they made it in 2 sizes.Also, the paper design would fall off in one wash. It should be printed on or left off."
2,Butter Void,"Totally disappointing product. A regular stick of butter doesn't fit...you have to trim the sides...no mention of that until you get the product.The lid is not an airtight fit. It has openings in the front at the ""mouth"" and in the back. In fact, it doesn't fit securely enough to avoid falling off if bumped. The concept of the Butter Boy is great, but the product design leaves alot to be desired."
4,A great little invention!,This Butter Boy idea is very handy for buttering your corn on the cob and my husband thought it was just GREAT! The little checkered tie does not stay on as it is made of just paper with an adhesive back. My suggestion to the maker of this item would be to make the little bandana or tie permanent by painting it on or making it part of the design when the plastic is made. Something that would stay on because it adds so much to the little fella being so cute!!! Maybe I'll paint one on my little naked guy...lol
1,butter boy,This product was not a very good one. It was something that you can buy at a Dollar Store for only $1.00.I was very disappointed in this product and I threw it away. I would never order from you again.
4,Movie with food as central theme.,"I am particularly partial to movie where food plays a central role in the story line (i.e. Babette;s Feast, Big Night, Eat Drink Man Woman, Simply Irresistible etc.) . This is a light comedy about a relationship between a chef and a woman who sells beer for a living.I added this DVD to what I call my ""food movie collection"" because it is fun to watch."
3,Not The Bio of Choice,"For those who have a serious interest in Gissing, but who want a single-volume critical biography, Paul Delany's is a far better choice. Halperin writes like a typical academic and his critical overestimates of some of the novels is a serious flaw. I haven't read Korg so I don't know if his book is better than Halperin's, but Delany's definitely delivers the goods."
4,Good book for materials scientists,"This is a good book for students and practicioners of materials science and engineering. Unlike traditional books in materials science which focus on properties and crystal structure, this book delves into synthesis out of elements, and how the chemical composition of a material in turn determines the properties and crystal structure. The book gives good coverage to different classes of materials such as borides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, alloys, intermetallics, and glasses. The book also gives a good overview of the different types of materials (and their physical origins) that materials are selected for. These include piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, phase transition temperatures, elastic constants, Debye temperature, etc... The text is accessible for engineers, chemists, and physicists, and is accompanied by many helpful illustrations and diagrams. I recommend this as good reading for materials engineers and scientists."
5,Very good Glossery,This is a very good glossery for the archane words that are used in the work of the heralds. As a member of the college of Heralds of the SCA and doing everyday genealogy this book is qutie valuable.
3,Jack Lemmon Always Gets 5 Stars,"...So there's nothing more to say about his role in this adaptation of Mitch Albom's book. Lemmon saves the day on this production, but I hate to say the rest isn't as good, thus the 3 stars here. Don't get me wrong though. I got the ""red eyes"" in all the programmed places."
4,Too real to be fake,"If you're looking for raunch, blood, guts, and in-your-face special effects, you'll be bored watching this movie. On the other hand, if you've ever wondered what it's like to be facing the end of your life, I think this movie will touch you. It's a good reminder that life is precious and we'll all be in Morrie's place some day. Enjoy and appreciate your life, whatever it is, while you still can."
2,Returned product,This DVD was returned as it was for area 1 and Australia is area 4.I would have thjought this was a normal check that would have been done before despatching.Brian Goodhew
2,Ho Hum,"One of the great ironies of this botched adaptation is that when it originally aired on TV, ""Cellular One"" was among the sponsors. Not to belittle the extraordinary talents of Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Azaria, but the filmmakers really blew it. Using flashbacks to illustrate as Morrie (Lemmon) talks about his childhood will seem pointless to anyone who has seen the film ""Short Cuts""--in which Mr. Lemmon delivers an entire terrific monologue without visual aids. Another problem is the whole relationship subplot (not in the book), not to mention Mitch's sportswriting ""adventures"". An interesting aspect of the book, only briefly touched on here, is America's obsession with the O.J. trial, which was in full swing at the time of the real Morrie's demise.I thought the book was great. I read it in a single morning, and it made me change the way I looked at some things. The movie only made me want to change the channel. Too bad!"
1,Hold the cheese!,"Even though I heard many good things about this film, I still approached it with a lot of scepticism. After all, the Harpo seal should be more than enough to start off alarm bells...What I found was trite and saccharine. Hank Azaria's performance is notably poor. Jack Lemmon alone salvages something from a hackneyed script, but it's not enough. Such a shame to see this fine actor trotting out drivel in his last days.I did not hate this movie -- I just found it to be an insult to intelligence. What scares me most is that people actually found something special to say about it. If you're after inspiration, without the cheese, look elsewhere. If you want to be comforted by illusions and continue living your sheltered lives, then you've found your movie!"
5,Morrie,"Tuesdays With Morrie is the greatest nonfiction !Everyone will learn how to be a ""real"" human ,and how to love others"
4,Tuesdays with Morrie,"Jack Lemmon is splendid as usual and Hank Azaria is also in good form in this touching movie of living your life to the fullest. Taking nothing for granted, and reevaluating what is truly important in our lives. It is a truly charming movie."
3,Tuesdays with Morrie,I ordered a few DVD's at once but this one took considerable longer that all the others.
5,Tuesdays with Morrie,"It took me all of 4 hours to read this book. It was insightful and entertaining. It was also sad. I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours. I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever."
4,Tuesdays with Morrie/DVD/movie,"Jack Lemmon was wonderful in his role as Morrie showing his own authentic aging in this movie which helped make the story more genuinely real. I have shown this true life story to my high school students, and it has brought tears to their eyes and an inkling of what lessons one can learn through experiecing even death--especially, such a devastating one as ALS. There were some changes in the movie of some aspects of the book TUESDAYS with MORRIE ,which is all the more reason to read the book as well which is totally factual. The ABC documentary of Ted Koppel's interviews with Morrie and the author--Mitch Ablom--is a perfect followup to the movie---extremely insightful, showing the reality of death, disease,and most of all, love and hope! The Lessons of Life-- ABC's Ted Koppel's three interviews with Morrie as the disease progressed throughout his body but not his spirit--- are inspirational and touching!!"
1,Made for TV,"All I can say is Worse than the book. I did.t like the book, but this was on one day when I had nothing to watch, so I sat through it. It's bad. Too 'made for TV'."
1,Syrupy Sweet and Corny,"O.K. I realize that this movie is well liked by many people out there, but personally I found it too be overly sentimental...in fact to the point that it was corny. What really pushed it over the edge was Morrie's habit of crying every five minutes, or so it seemed. If that had been toned down, the movie may have been salvageable. My favorite movie genre are ""tearjerkers"" but I can't say this is one I would recommend."
4,GOOD STORY,WHAT A SWEET LOVE STORY. A GREAT ONE TO JUST SIT BY THE FIREPLACE AND READ - CLEAN AND CALM.
5,Stirs the soul,"This book changed my life and I just watched the movie tonight after 1st seeing it 6 years ago. I can't explain what it does more than the title; this story stirs the soul. It makes you think of life in a far different context than the hussle and bussle of everyday life allows us to. It shows us we need to slow down, enjoy the simple things in life and show people we love them on a regular basis, not just when it's convenient. I recommend this book and movie to EVERYONE, especially those who have lost someone, or who maybe have someone in their life that is ill. It makes you reevaluate the things you once thought were important. Also, there are countless messages of life and love and learning to live, we should all be so luck to hear Morrie's last ""course"" and are even more blessed to have a ""Morrie"" in our lives."
3,tuesdays with morrie,"The movie was interesting but it was something that I had to purchase for a nursing class that I was taking. Otherwise, I'm sure I would not have purchase it. Good movie though."
5,A great soundtrack:D,I really love a movie that has a great soundtrack and this is one of those movies. Every song in this album is so fun and a great listen for anytime.
5,Excellent item,"Looks even better by far in person. Chain is beautiful, almost worth buying the necklace just for the chain."
3,Nice,"Why you may wonder I wrote this tittle, nice, well to tell you the truth I brought this chain to my girlfriend and she was pleased, indeed, sadly the chain has a mayor issue, its weak and can break in a hearthbeat, yes I still have the chain but as you may guess already it's broken."
4,Very elegant....but.....,"So I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. As soon as she saw it, she loved it. I put it on and she had a big smile on her face. About 2 minutes later, the smile turned to a quick grimace of pain. I asked her what happened, and she said that the necklace just pulled some hair on the back of her neck. This has been the chief complaint from my wife about the necklace. At least every other day I take it off her to cut off the hair that gets tangled in the chain. The heart itself is fine, but the manufacturer of the chain should make some of the wives of employees try it on for about a week.... they would make a big change if that were to happen...."
5,Great Gift!,"My boyfriend got this necklace for me as an early first anniversary present. I love it! It is a beautiful gift, not to big and very elegant. I will wear it everyday if I can!"
5,"Great as a gift, with fast shipping, too.","Very quick shipping - I ordered it on the 5th, promptly got the tracking info, and it was delivered across the country on the 7th.The heart and chain were great, exactly as described, and much enjoyed by the recipient. It was a birthday gift, so that was a relief. I am glad I trusted all the glowing reviews here. Thanks, Amazon-reviewers!"
5,Beautiful!!,I ordered these for my children's teachers for Valentine's Day and they are gorgeous! I tried one on and would love to order one for myself. It looks expensive and unique. It is a great piece for a heart lover!
5,Good call,"I was looking for something a little different to get for my niece. So, I took the advice from Amazon on what to get her. I just typed in her age and relation to me and it made some suggestions. Among the suggestions, I looked over all the reviews, which were very helpful. This particular necklace got among the highest and it got rave reviews from my niece. I'd recommend it if you have a hard to shop for teenage relative. So far, she hasn't taken it off since Christmas."
5,Beautiful and unique.,"I love this. It is so simple, yet beautiful and unique. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for the perfect gift."
5,The Wife Loves It,"Nice solid sterling silver chain and pendant. Very sleek heart and the way it hangs looks very classy. The serpentine chain is thin (but not tiny) and very feminine. The hook clasp is easy to fasten. Amazon had a good price so not only is it nice, it's a good buy."
2,Okay for a Propoganda Piece,"""The Plague Dogs"" exists solely to condemn scientists who conduct medical research on animals. By anthropomorphizing dogs and other animals from a research lab, Adams hope to convince readers that medical testing on live animals is wrong.I wonder if Adams (or anyone opposed to animal testing) thinks that it's a shame that we have antibiotics and vascular surgery. Neither would exist (along with most modern medicine)without animal research.Given that the book is written on a false premise, it's very readable. Adams is a good storyteller, and the book is generally interesting if a bit treacly. It is, however, filled with difficult Scottish dialect.My verdict: It's a decent read as long as you remember that dogs don't talk and they don't reason and that the author has an agenda."
4,Doggie vision,"I really enjoyed the point of view of this tale, that is, the world (and humans) seen through the eyes of a dog. The dogs are not overly anthropomorphised; they have very doglike thoughts. Being a dog owner, I found much of it very amusing.This book has one of the most creatively constructed endings I have ever read. The reader closes the book on one ending, with the understanding that the more likely ending to the story is one that concluded earlier, and you can take away what you like."
5,Patience will be rewarded,"This book is considered one of Adams' weaker works. Readers will find it maddeningly moralistic, pompus and self important. It follows the intrepid adventures of two dogs who have escaped from an animal research station in the Lake Country, U.K.But listen - I nearly threw this book across the room a half dozen times when reading it. I've seen the film, loved that, and I was determined to get through the muddy waters of the book. It was worth it. The last forty-some pages of this book are pure genius, absolutely riveting narrative. If you can make it through to the end, you will be rewarded with edge of your seat, nail biting tension. John Grisham has got nothing on this guy.In short, read this book. READ IT! Do not skip to the end. Be prepared to hate it. I did. Act Three will leave you breathless, and isn't it all the more worthwhile when you've had to work to get to the end? I think so. Thank you, Richard Adams!"
2,"Okay, discription is good, but not 20 pages of it at 1 time!","Watership down was a great book, with humor and warmth and lots of discriptive paragraphs. I love watership, in fact, it's my favorite book, but some of the discriptions got a little tiresome after a while. In the plague dogs, it just dosn't end. Discribing and blah blah blah blah blah blah about all this stuff that no one cares about. How do you finish a book like this? I sure don't know, because I just couldn't do it. The plague dogs could have been a great book, it really could have. But it was totally ruined by pages and pages of junk. If you are a fan of Watership Down, I suggest you skip this book, unless you actually LIKE spacy paragraphs of discriptions. This book, in my opinion, is nothing but ad nausuem......"
2,A terrific premise...,"Well, I have rather mixed feelings about this book. I always enjoy a good dog book - and this one certainly had points that were good, but I was a bit bogged down by the style. It feels overly wordy, with few sympathetic characters and contains no women to speak of. There are some interesting characters and aspects - I particularly like the depiction of Snitter's madness. The premise is quite interesting and I would have liked it more had it been executed in a different way. Really, the ending is the entire book's saving grace. Overall, it seems that Diane Jessup'sThe Dog Who Spoke with Gods, may have been inspired by this. It most certainly shares the theme of depicting animal cruelty - though they both display about it in a different way. Jessup's novel is a much more engaging novel."
2,Don't buy this expecting Watership Down,"Surprisingly unreadable given the quality of Watership Down. Adams appears to experiment in this book with being an active participant in the story, but succeeds in only making me wonder at the end of the book why I stuck with it. Interesting viewpoint on animal research, but fully misses the point in providing a good read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Prefer experiments on rodents, thanks.Like in Watership Down, the animals are the main characters from a point of view perspective in this novel. For a recent techno take on this see We3, for example. Here, the dogs are just being experimented on, not being made into weapons.When they escape, they have to forage to survive, and get help from a fox. One of the animals is a bit brain damaged from what has been done to him at the vivisection lab.The title comes from the fact that a reporter of the less than ethical variety spreads the story that the animals are infected, as a cover."
2,Too tedious for me,"I really hate writing bad reviews, but I review what I'm reading, and this book was hard to keep up to my eyes.I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for something really dramatic and exciting to happen, but I'm getting nothing but internal conflicts in the characters.Yeah, ever once in a while there is a tiny bit of action, but lasts for only a few seconds and then dies totally, and nothing happens again for 100 pages.To tell the truth, I'm on ""FIT 10"" (the very long chapter). I'll very much intend to finish this book, only because Mr. Adams really is getting me to think these dogs aren't going to make it. So I'll finish it to see if the dogs live or die.Like everyone is saying, this is a hard book to read. It's very confusing and uses lots of big words and bad words and such and such. I started reading this book because I am a huge fan of Watership Down and I wanted to see what other things Adams wrote. Oh well."
5,AWESOME BOOK,"Wow! I love this book! I am thirteen and I picked this book to do for a book report at school. Yes, the beginning is a bit hard to read through, and he does write a lot of seemingly useless, long, boring paragraphs, but it is so worth it to get this book. The characters are great. Gotta love that Snitter.. The language used is a little hard to understand, but you'll get the basic idea if you try a little. oh, and don't listen to those review-ers who are saying that it is too boring to read. Most of them said they only read about 10 pages! Perservere!! (haha) I look forward to watching the movie, although I hear its pretty depressing. Ah well. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Worth the read,"I just recently finished this book and can say with much sincerety that Adams has created a wonderful piece of work in ""The Plague Dogs."" It's true that some of the dialogue is especially tough to get through especially being an American reader, but after a while I found myself going through it with a fair amount of ease once I was finally used to it. The best part of this book by far has to be the characters of Rowf and Snitter whom I found tremendously more interesting than any of the human characters. Their struggles and perception of the reality around them is quite remarkable. As far as how the message was presented I thought it was done quite fairly on both sides of the issue of animal experimentation. Finally, there's the ending which made the entire book worth the read."
4,Heartbreaking,This story is so traumatizingly sad. I watched the movie and I decided to read the book but it breaks my heart. The sadness of the dogs loyalty to humans despite all that's happened is just heart wrenching.There are characters who speak in heavily accented English but while it slows you down in some parts but its far from unreadable- later editions address this and there's a glossary where you can look it up.Sad sad story about animals and people and how we interact with each other. I hugged my cat afterward and told her I loved her.If you watched the movie there are some more scenes that are just as heart wrenching.
5,Plague Dogs,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. I've never read anything like it, for it takes readers on a journey like no other book has done before. The story follows two dogs on their escape from a science lab, and then hunted because they were rumored to have the bubonic plague. Some editions have the real ending and an alternate ending, so look for those, because both are really good. Richard Adams has a confusing prose sometimes, but does an excellent job at giving a variety of voices to the characters. I swear, when I and others have read this book, I had trouble keeping tears out of my eyes, and that is a must when reading it in school! :) This is a worthwhile read, but this is probably not for people who can't stand violence or sadness. But it is definitely worth checking out."
2,Disappointing Read,"I wanted to like this book, having discovered and enjoyed Watership Down as an adult reader. This book is not an easy read nor is it as engaging as Watership Down. Bogged down by pages and pages of descriptions of North England terrain, which was nearly incomprehensible with out a map, and characters speaking in an almost as incomprehensible dialog made reading through the whole book more of a chore than an enjoyment. While I was curious to learn the character's fates I wouldn't say I was emotionally invested at all. Overall I couldn't recommend it. I made it through the book, but I wouldn't do it again."
2,allllmost there...,"this book, although very interesting and lots of what i love about this author (the animals), pails in comparison to Adams' other books. The long drawn out explainations made me soon lose interest and i had to fight just to make it to the end. at times, however it was exactly what i expected from the author or Watership Down"
5,Beauty.,"This was one of my first books when I was a very small child, and it's the only book I still have that I had then. I love it more every time I read it, and I read it all the time. I notice something new every time I read it, and I could read it forever. It's just wonderful."
1,The power of positive thinking,"Larry Kudlow is probably the most optmistic public figure out there. The problem is, he has no sense of realism.I think we all know how he is going to respond to a situation before he even opens his mouth. The man really cannot be taken seriously because he's blinded by one and only one agenda. I really laugh when he says things like ""well, those people losing their jobs, will just have to be re-trained"". Now that is the most silver-spoon, Ivy league nonsense I've heard in a while. Only people way out of touch with the average person would make a statement like that - a statement straight out of academia. Some of the things he spouts out on TV these days are even more ridiculous. His love of everything Republican blinds him to improvement because he can't be self critical. He still thinks we're in Iraq to free the Iraqi's and preserve American freedoms for Gods sake!"
5,Must read for all investors.,"With this compilation, Kudlow explains the underpinnings of the current economic prosperity in the United States. From Schumpeter's ""gales of creative destruction,"" to the start of the supply-side revolution in the mid-1980's, to the current information-based economy, this book provides keen insight into the way the world works. Kudlow exposes the danger and deceipt of current Keynesian/Phillips curve thinkers and outlines an optimistic path toward continued prosperity. Outstanding!!"
4,Solid Book with Interesting Ideas,"Larry is one of the sharpest minds on Wall Street. His critics accuse him of being Pollyanna-ish at times. They're right. However, if that's the worst accusation hurled at him he should count his blessings. After all, it is optimism which has led the U.S. to such staggering success. This book is open, honest and cleverly written. It has a number of great ideas, including the ""four dead bodies"" theorem which encourages looking at the full spectrum of inflationary signals, rather than focusing on one alone, like gold.A great read.."
5,An Autobiography Unlike Any Other,"In this short, fascinating book Roth narrates the story of his life up to the publication of ""Portnoy's Complaint."" Then, in a long epilogue, Nathan Zuckerman (Roth's fictional alter-ego) critiques Roth's account, pointing out omissions and biases and attacking the ""public relations tone"" of the manuscript. If you have ever felt the sting of your outraged conscience, or laughed at how you trip over your own feet intellectually, Roth is the author for you."
4,"A good book, but only of interest to those familiar with his work","Philip Roth is undoubtably one of the 20th centuries best authors. He is also a fairly interesting figure and much of his best work is highly autobiographical...as such, it is inevitable that people are interested in the ""truth"" of his life and what really happened. Roth obliges here, mostly, giving us an account of his life (only up until the publication of Portnoy's Complaint though) that seems quite true, but written in a way that feels novelistic and as if Roth was writing in the voice of another character. Then he bookends the autobiography with his fictional counter part, Zuckerman, commenting on the text and pondering the nature of truth, autobiography, etc.This is a good book, but at then end of the day its not interesting to anyone who hasn't read the Zuckerman books, Portnoy's Complaint and his other autobiographical books. Its nice to get an account of what he drew on exactly, but only if you've read those books."
4,"Not quite ""The Facts""","Roth disarms his critics by getting his alter ego, Zuckerman, to comment. He concentrates of key elements of his life, and is particularly candid in his comments on his first wife and his response to her death. I felt a little sorry for the Boston University senior who got a few brief comments. She failed to set his imagination alight I suppose.I am not a fan but the clarity of the writing and the astute observations of himself and others make this a fine read for anyone who find human interaction intriguing."
3,a good book,"good book. more than enough action, well enough written (though simplistic). our hero must lead a group of rebels without help from his employers, and must face his foes, while protecting a girl. simple, but good. easy, interesting read. but don't expect too much."
2,Breaks when the wind blows,"It's a fantastic idea: Wear your pick, make a statement, look cool and be able to play at the drop of a hat!In reality the Bolopick is just a cheap piece of plastic with a string. You can remove the pick from the plastic shroud about 15 times before it snaps in two.I won't be buying another until this little issue is resolved. Bolopick 2 perhaps?"
5,Blob Frog,"It has like little holes in it, and you can take out the ball. It has purple hands and a green or yellow body. You could squish it and it's really squishy. It will break easily if you squish too hard. The goo is purple."
1,Don't waste your money,These videos are hardly worth the money spent. The film looks homemade at best with only music as the background and no commentary. My kids wanted to know what was supposed to be the funny parts because you could not tell. Looks like alot of sports clips strung together by someone but not professionally done. An occasional laugh out loud one but that's it.
1,IT DOES'T WORK,"HELLO I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU WROTE THIS BOOK. THE SPELL I TRYED WAS FOR HEALTH. AND THE SPELL BACK FIRED ON ME. IF Y WULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY I USED THIS SPELL IS BECAUSE I AM HIV+ AND I NEEDED SOME STRENGH THE SUNFLOWER SEED/OLIVE OIL/ASSORTED FRUITS,AND THE SPELL JUST DIDN'T WORK. I AM REAL STRONG WICCAN. SO DON'T SELL OR USE BOOK'S THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.I AM NOT BEING RUDE BUT NOW I AM JUST WANTING YOU TO KNOW?THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIMETONY."
3,Good Heat; Poor Function,"I bought this to use on an injured shoulder. Heat works well - microwave is convenient and easy. Odd that the strap does not have velcro? You have to tie the loose ends together, yet when draped over my shoulder the ends don't come together well. Hard to make stay on my shoulder."
4,Keeps temperature well,I got this product for low back pain and it's helped quite a bit. Max 2 minutes in the microwave and this wrap will keep plenty warm for about an hour. It's also nice that it ties around my waist so I can walk around doing household chores while I let the heat work to soothe my muscles.
3,Works,"If this had velcro instead of a tie, it may hold on better and it just doesn't hold the heat very long or get cold enough when you need cold!"
4,Excellent Arthritis Relief,"Bought this as a gift for our 92 year old Grandmother who suffers from terrible arthritis in her back. Very easy for her to use, and re-use, and she said it felt wonderful. We couldn't be happier to have found something to help her manage her pain other than pain medication!"
5,Wow,What a relief. Moist heat is now 2 minutes away from the microwave. I like it. My back loves it.
3,Disapppointing,"The concept is great. However, it holds heat for such a short while that it's not at all effective.By the time you get it adjusted to your body it has cooled off significantly. How many trips can one mak back and foroth to the microwave! t defeats the purpose."
1,If I could I would give this a -negative star rating.,In the last year I have gone through two of these. They both did the same thing. A hole developed in the underside of the product and the beads came out. Now I did not heat this too much or to the desired amount of time . If anything I under heated it. This was not cheap and quite costly. It states that one can clean this. How can it be cleaned if it melts together and the beads fall out of holes that develop. It is USELESS. Get another heating pad.
2,it will melt if u keep it in the microwave more then 2:40 minutes,"its good for the first 10 mins of heating then it gets cold, and if u want to reheat it, do not put it over 1 1/2 minutes bc it will melt the cover."
3,No size in description,"Can you please provide a size for these clothespins? I'm looking for a specific sized clothespin, so this would be very helpful information. Thanks!"
5,kids,my kids love it. they like cam jansen anyway. its also relevant on my kids current preference in sport.just choose the right lexile level.
3,Good enough to watch,"A good movie and interesting but I suggest that you get the Comedian Harmonist before you get this one. Also, Die Flucht is good too but careful, no subtitles on Die Flucht so know your German."
4,The Tunnel,"i love this movie, i watched it a couple of times. i grew up in germany and i remember all this very well. Also Heino Frech is a great german actor."
5,Top Notch movie!,"My husband and I started watching this a little later one night and thought we would turn it off and finish it the next evening. Well, come midnight, we were absolutely riveted and there was no way we were going to bed without finishing it!! Fantastic movie! A complete nailbiter - I recommend to all"
5,Survival With a Sense of Humor,"Oksana Kornienko Leslie's paean to her marriage to American husband Kieth is ""right on the button"" and ""straight from her heart"" ---intimate, joyous, touching, funny, informative, optimistic, ironic and wacky. Oksana has written a down-to- earth and ebullient story all at once and all rolled together. The book is a wonderful read! Dr. Robert Appleton, Russian history teacher. Gettysburg PA"
1,Wow..,"Well, it is really a biography of the author. I didn't like the book at all. I borrow it from a friend, and after reading it I realized that it was a complete waste of time. There is nothing new, and nothing useful."
4,This is the best of all the Pokemon Games,This is the best of all the Pokemon Games. The Pokemon move when you look at there stats and some of they are great. You can easily get over one hundred Pokemon. But you can't get certain Pokemon that are found in Gold and Silver verions. The easiest one of the two legendary bird to catch is Lugia because you have two get all the Dog Pokemon which is hard. I only have two of the three and I have not seen the thrid. Other than that is the best of all the Pokemon games!
4,this is an awsome game,"this game is very simular to G/S version. but this game has many new features. you can catch suciune more easily but,you can not catch two other that easily.If u like lugia and ho-oh u like this game. u can catch them both at lv.60. the rainbow wing is harder to get than the silver wing.you have to catch the three legendary pokemon first and then it will appear i euretak city. the other new feature is like the battle tower. its a great way to train.the off side i think is in the battle tower your pokemon can't be one level higher then the chosen level for your opponent. so overal this is maybe still the best pokemon game."
3,Suicine a.k.a Crystal Version,Great Game! LOVE the Big Part Unknown and Suicine play. The Battle Tower a great way to train. But the part about catching little monsters that run around and attack is a little old.
2,Again???,The same story gets boring after awhile reapeating itself over and over again. That's excatly what what Pokemon is. Just a simple reapeat of itself. When they came out with Gold and Silver they had a whole new world. Now just besides better Graphics and A tiny new twist this is just a boring game. :(
4,Great Game,"It's a good game, the three starter pokemon could be rated beginner, medium hard. You can catch most of the pokemon. Also, you can get one of the lengendery pokemon really easy. Overall, Pokemon Crystarl is a pretty good game."
4,Very Good!!,I like this game because it is a cool game to play. I don't like about this gameis that you can't get a Celebi(#251 pokemon)on the english verison you could only get it in the janpaness verison.
2,Crystal: It Could Be Better,"For somebody who enjoyed Y, I found this game pretty dull. Being male, the new female character didn't affect me at all, so that addition.... The slight animation wasn't that amazing, but a nice little extra. Y was considerably better since it was more different from R and B than Crystal is from G and S. At least in Y the Gym Leaders were different. Being a major Pokefan I must give this game some credit. If you really, really love Pokemon you'll probably be pleased with the little add-ons. Happy Gaming!"
2,Not very good.,"Pokémon Crystal is basically just Gold and Silver with new features. If you played Gold or Silver before, I reccomend that you don't get it. But if you haven't owned Gold or Silver, buy it. Nintendo also took out good features that are in the Japanese version (ex. catching a LV. 30 Celebi at the forest after Azelea Town). Besides, after you beat it, it will start to get boring, and eventually you will stop for a while.To sum it up: Buy it if you have never played G or S. Don't if you HAVE played G or S."
5,The Greatest in the series,I beleive this is the best in the pokemon series. I like the new animation effects. I also like it because you can link battle with Gold and Silver.
1,No Save battery.,"I purchased this game thinking it would be the best purchase ever. but the day i got it i tried it out, had my fun and I saved and turned off my Gameboy. Then the next day i turn it back on to find that i had no save file. then i looked at the game cartridge and it had no save battery. i expected a save battery. i regret buying this $30 game, that i would've got for cheaper somewhere else and with a save battery."
4,A Lot more than before...,"Pokemon Crystal gives you the option of being a boy or girl, plus some other things. There are new pics of some Pokemon, and while you're battleing, the pics move! Some even growl if you take to long. There are rumors that you can catch Mew in several different places, and, of course, you can catch Celebi. It's almost a must have for any pokemon trainer^_^"
4,Good,"This is the product of Nintendo FINALLY knowing that there are a few girls out there who play. There are a few alterations, but if you are looking at this before you buy Gold or Silver, get this one. A couple of neat features make the game nicer to play, and girl will get a kick out of being able to show the world that girls can kick some butt. Nice game, and nicely on that line between impossible and sleeping."
4,Pokemon Crystal,"I love this game. It is so much fun. I got a very fast delivery, faster than expected. Very happy with my product and how the transaction went down."
5,Pokemon Crystal,"This game sounds really good if u get to choose if your a boy or a girl (im a girl). And i've played the red, blue, yellow, gold, and silver (and i own them..only red complete though)and if Crystal is as good as i've been hearing, im so gonna get it!"
4,Pok'emon Crystal,"I'm sorry that i'm not going to say anything that great about this game, but, i recommend this game for female Pok'efans. Oh and theres somethin' i want to say to that dumb 12-year old gamer: for your info you can't catch Celebi on the Jap's version either; i have it."
2,sure,"man, let me tell you something. For all those pokemon nuts who have 10 posters of Pikachu or 3 Jiggleypuff plush dolls, u should get this. If you already own Gold or Silver, don't bother. I'll admit, u can be either a boy or girl, they made each pokemon move once during a battle, the color's better and the pokemon Tower was added. Other then that, it's not really worth it. It's just the same. Do not buy it if you own Silver or Gold."
3,Great. Now there are 6 games that are almost identical.,I have been a pokemon fan for about 2 or 3 years and have played and mastered Pokemon red blue yellow silver and gold. Throughout my game playing I have discovered that red and blue are identical with the exception of some different pokemon in each game. Yellow is the same as red and blue except pikachu follows you and won't go in a ball and your meeting places with different enemies are somewhat different. And gold and silver are also identical but the places where you get some items are different. All in all I think that the producers of these games are just making the same game over and over with only 2 or 3 differences tops. True it will be great to have a girl be the main character in this one but I think that this game is one that is only worth renting if even that.
2,What a jip,If you want to throw away thirty dollars heres the anwser. No new pokemon at all? Thats super [bad] right there.
3,Pokemon Crystal version-only for Game Boy Color,"I would not recommend getting a used copy of this version and I should have bought a new copy of this when it first came out. The used copy has serious problems keeping the saved data, just like its Gold and Silver counterparts."
5,moving pokemon,Crystal version is cool because the pokemon move. I beat the pokemon leage in one try. I started out with totodile. You can catch a hippip at the begining of the game. I think you will find a person who can tell where you caught your pokemon in a certain city.
4,CRYSTAL IS COOL,"POKEMON CRYSTAL IS THE FIRST POKEMON GAME THAT LETS YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN GENDER. THERE IS A NEW RIVAL THATS OBSESSED WITH CATCHING SUICUNE. WHEN YOU RUN INTO WILD POKEMON THEY MOVE, YES, THEY ACTUALLY MOVE E.G.(lUGIA HEAD MOVES UP AND DOWN, EYES BLINK, TAIL SWAYS, ECT.). THE LEGENDARY DOGS/CATS/WHATEVER ARE FIGURES JUST LIKE HO-OH AND LUGIA. YOU CAN GET CELEBI BY GETTING THE GS BALL. THEN GIVE IT TO KURT FOR A DAY THEN COME BACK AND GET THE BALL AND PUT THE BALL IN THE SHRINE IN ILEX FORREST. I DON'T BELIVE HO-OH IS IN CRYSTAL. THE SHINY POKEMON ARE EASIER TO GET. THEIR ARE NEW TM'S THAT ARE ALREADY INTHE GAME BUT NOT AS TM'S. THERE ARE NO NEW POKEMON BUT THE GAME IS STILL FUN. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TRADE TO AND FROM RED, BLUE, GOLD, SILVER, BUT NO NEW POKEMON OR ATTACKS CAN BE TRADED TO RED AND BLUE. CRYSTAL IS ALSO COMPATABLE WITH POKEMON STADIUM 2. POKEMON CRYSTAL WILL BE AVAILABLE JULY 30,2001."
1,i don't like pokemon crystal,"THis game is [junk] you don't get anything new just being a boy or a girl.The plot is the same as before and no new pokemon just the same 250!Buying this game is a waste of money ,but if you want lugia or houhou just buy gold or silver.Both games are the same and being a master neither game tells a new tail.... Thats my opinion so if your a master don't be fooled it's a waste of time! thanks, Deathsythe06"
1,poopy,pokemon is old and this stinks what is the point of having it anyway stupid pokemon delayed and cancelled EarthBound 64! now doesent that stink yes no. is you said no you have no taste
4,Save Works..but..,"Well the saving function worked just like they said it would. The only thing that they didn't tell me that the save function did not work properly. If you save in morning and turn it on at night it's going to leave off at the same spot you last saved it. So it makes it a difficult task to capture all the pokemon. However, I'm glad to have the game just to reminisce my childhood times. The value is what counts."
5,Best of Pokemon Crystal,Pokemon is really good espesically Pokemon Crystal.I wrote a short reviewbecause i do not want the viewers hurt their eyes.
1,don't waste your time,my son hates it. i got it for him a couple of days ago and he got bored with it the first day!
1,WHY DOES THIS EXIST?,"Oddly enough, this game seemed like a great big advertisement for itself. Why it would advertise for itself, I don't know, but that's what it was doing. I'm amazed that people, even small children, would be so receptive to self-love on this level, but, then again, I've been amazed before.I'm sorry for those who think that this game is the height of entertainment. I assure you that there is more out there."
1,Broke after the first use....,I really hate it when i spend 40 bucks on a game that says has a working internal battery that dosnt have a working internal battery. Not just that but repairing it was a bitch and the new battery will fall out of place sometimes and erase my game again. Waste of money.
1,"The battery of used version could be dead, and it's very hard to open the game","The game has a battery inside, if you buy a used one and the seller didn't replace battery inside, it's very hard to open it and change the battery."
4,It's super,I bought this game 3 months ago and I play it every day you can explore the new world and the world in red and blue and you can catch many pokemons some in jhoto and some in the other world like pikachu and others you can play in the game corner you have a egg and you can put your pokemons in day care and your pokemons leater have a egg.this game is the best I recommend this game you can play it in game boy advanced or in game boy color is the best
4,"Fun, but don't stop right away!","Sure, through the first few cities everything is exactly the same. The people even say the same things! But if you continue the game, then you will realize it's pretty different. Especially in Eructeak City. I like this game, but I suggest renting it first so you know if you want to buy it or not. I made the mistake of buying it asap."
3,CRYSTLE?,"Crystle isn`t a must get game ,well sure it has new fetures but almost the same as gold or silver so if you alredy have g|s dont get this game!"
2,not for non-readers,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son, who loves to watch Pokemon on T.V. After about a week of him not showing much interest in the game, I tried to play it myself. This game requires the child to know how to read. I had no idea the game required reading. I bought him a new game that does not require reading, and he plays with his gameboy advance daily. It may be a great game, but he won't know until after he learns to read sometime in the next year or so."
5,Helpful and Inspirational,"I have read many self help books over the years and I have found this book to be practical, encouraging, insightful, and interesting. Like the others who commented, I could relate to many of the scenerios that were presented and I found myself highlighting most of the book. It has been 2 weeks since I began reading this and I already feel a little stronger and confident. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who struggles with low self-esteem and the workbook is very, very beneficial at applying the author's comments. (Make sure you get the workbook).The only negative of this book is that I wish it were longer! I just did not want it to end!"
2,Too much example and not enough explaination,"I have never read a book on LSE before but after the first 3 chapters I was presented with more-than-enough example cases of LSE. This book did not satify my curiosity for this subject. Almost the entire book was written about she did this, he did that and never really explain to any depth the psychological process of LSE."
4,Be ready,"My suggestion is to make sure you're ready to recall painful memories because I cried every night I read the book, and now that I am done, all I do is cry when something bad happens. It seems nearly impossible to apply the skills from the book when you have been convinced your whole life that you are incapable of accomplishing new things. At the end of the book, this is how I felt: devastated...not because of the book, but because of the realization I came to that yeah my life sucks.Love always,Melina"
1,Sigh...another product loaded with fake 5-star reviews,You can't trust reviews on Amazon anymore. You'll note most of the 5-star reviews for this product are written by 'people' who have only written one review ever. Try sorting reviews by lowest rating first for some honest feedback.
5,no title,"I ended up highlighting half the book. I am one of the last people who is inclined to self help, but this book has begun to change my life."
4,Comforting,"This book gave me some comfort knowing that I'm not alone in my painfully low self-esteem. In fact, it made so much sense I felt like she was speaking directly to me. That being said, I didn't find it to be all that helpful in learning how to change my automatic thought processes. She provides some exercises at the end of the chapters but learning how I developed such a poor self-image and how to change are two different things. All in all I recommend the book to anyone struggling with LSE as it will at least give you some perspective."
4,Self-Help,Some very good and useful informationA good reference book.Have recommended this book to a couple of my clients
5,A great help,"This is a great book for anyone who thinks they may have LSE. It is easy to read, explain problems thoroughly, gives you excercises to increase self esteme and most importantly makes you realize that you can overcome the problem."
2,Misleading titel!,"This is not a book about ""breaking the chain of low self-estemm"", this book is about understanding low self-esteem. Why am I told on page 29: ""This book is the first step in my 3-step plan for recovery"" (watch out for the commercials in the book!)when the titel and the back of the book are are saying something else?Furthermore the book only applies the method of cognitive behvior therapy. But not all thoughts are creating feelings, often it is the other way round. We give our feelings labels, but these labels are not the cause for the feeling.Finally it is highly disputed if you have to analyse everything in order to solve your problem. This is old, technical thinking (My car broke down, where is the problem, so that I can fix it). The brain as a self-organizing system is not that simple. See:More Than Miracles: The State of the Art of Solution-focused Brief Therapy (Haworth Brief Therapy)Or:Natural Self Esteem: An integrative way to reclaim your true self-worth for good"
2,Initially uplifting but short on a real solution,"I read and used this book when going through a period of severe depression and found that it initially gave me a lift through its confident tone but the actual healing technique was weak I thought.For people with serious depressive problems and who rely on medication look elsewhere, i.e. go to Google and search for ""Redirecting Self Therapy"", it actually works."
1,"Awful, not worth a cent.","I can't honestly believe the number of 5-star reviews. Not simply because I found this book so unsatisfying, but because there are nothing but glowing reviews for this book. The book is full of clichés, and it just feels like the author thinks the statements profound. If you like things on the corny side and love cats, then this is the book for you. If you want something honestly thought provoking, move along."
4,"Slick, ornate world fusion","This glitzy mix of West African, Celtic, Asian and North American folk is the type of world-beat fusion goulash that stirs its fans into joyful conniptions and drives world music purists up the wall. This is their fifth album, showing a continuing refinement of the eclectic approach that brough them widesread fame back in the 1990s. At times, particularly on the more Irish-flavored numbers, UK-based vocalist Su Hart drifts in Enya-esque territory... however, I'm sure that won't be much of a problem for already-devoted Baka fans. If you liked their earlier albums, this one will not disappoint."
4,Dangerous if untreated . . .,"Depression is often misunderstood and misdiagnosed in young people; the popular thinking probably being ""what have they got to be depressed about?"" Yet you have only to pick up a newspaper to see the devastating effects of undiagnosed and untreated depression on young persons today. This is a good, helpful book!Compact in size and plainly written (I get bogged down in most medically written books) by a parent and former educator, this guide shows teachers and parents how to recognize even mild cases of depression; shows how to get treatment, and explains methods of coping and caring.There's an old saying that parenthood should come with an instruction manual. Maybe it should come with this book, too."
4,Short Overview of Homer,"This is a short introduction to the Iliad and the Odyssey. It is not very exciting but covers the standard academic territory pretty well. It has some nice sections in translation. Parts of it depend on having some knowledge of Greek. The author writes with the assured grace and precision of traditional British scholarship, which is always a pleasure to read. However the main thing this introduction has to recommend it is its brevity."
3,This mini-series is true.,"I wanted to like this mini-series more than I did. Unfortunately, quite a bit of it did not translate as well on television as it did on stage. Biggest quibble, much of the dialogue did not translate well onto the smaller medium.I have to admit that I am surprised at the vitriol and hatred of some of the reviews this film has received. I suppose that much of the ill will towards PWA that existed in the 80's has not gone away. My advice, if you are a homophobe do not watch this movie, and if you do watch it don't complain about gay characters. One more thing, this film is not lying about the way that the AIDS pandemic has been treated by the Republicans and much of America. Let them complain about revisionist history, but the conservatives are the one's doing all the revising on the topic of AIDS. This film is the true (if somewhat surrealist) story of what actually happened.Regardless, I recommend the film, but treat it as a companion piece to the plays."
3,Everything it was on stage and less . . .,"Very loyal re-working of the brilliant Broadway show, but not much imagination. Mike Nichols does an exceptionally capable job bringing the play to the screen, but it rarely lifts off and feels like a real ""movie."" Streep is wonderful as always, Parker out ""Parkers"" Parker and Pacino is over the top. Could have used a more imagintive hand at the helm but still happy to see it recorded on the screen"
5,beyond wonderful,"If they had released this movie in the theaters, there would not have been enough Academy awards to give to the writer, the director, and the wonderful cast. Who should get Best Actor? Al Pacino as the loathesome Roy Cohn or Justin Kirk as the dying Prior Walter? Who should get Best Actress? Meryl Streep as the practical, compassionate Mormon housewife, or Emma Thompson as the beautiful, terrifying angel? This series had me riveted to the TV set. I could not do anything but watch. Get this movie. You owe it to yourself to witness one of the major artistic events of the decade."
5,a beautiful beautiful movie,"The acting is suburb, the directing, and a beautiful story for those that really care to hear the message. Just one thing would make it better..... If it was on Amazon instant video."
1,"the play which should have been a book, not a movie","OK, I figured this was a winner, given the hype, Pacino/Streep, and the dramatic topic of AIDS. I was even willing to plop $9 down to RENT this two disc, six hour borefest. Too much verbal volleyball and poor angelic effects instead of story and character development. Only good thing I can say was the acting was superb."
2,"Good acting, bad story.","The wonderful cast and first-rate acting make this story almost watchable. Unfortunately, the subject material and lack of a coherent story make this DVD a huge let-down.Just watching these great actors struggling to pretend that they actually care about the subject matter becomes almost laughable. It is indeed a great tribute to this cast that they could make it through the filming of this third-rate script.Wonderful acting, terrible material."
2,"So much hype and great reviews, and it was a snoozer","This was SO overhyped that by the time it finally came on I was expecting to be blown away. Instead. 10 opening minutes of Meryl Streep playing a Rhabbi. So what? What was the point of her playing a man? Are they shoving her ""amazing"" acting abilities down our throat or are they trying to present a great play on TV? I really really wanted to like this and as it droned on and on I gave up about 2 hours into it. Maybe its great for someone else, enjoy if thats the case."
1,a series of dream sequences... terrible,"I do not usually bother making the effort to write a review, but in this case could not resist. I gave it every break I could, this was one long boring cruel series of dream sequences.I got it, got the msg the series is trying to make, wanted to like this but it was quite simple atrocious. What a pity."
5,Magnificent,"I have seen many hundreds of movies, and this is only the third that I rate 5 stars. The acting was beyond superb, the screenplay and story line truly outstanding. I saw the play many years ago and totally enjoyed it. The DVD was even better.While reading the reviews, it becomes obvious folks get different things out of the movie depending on their frame of reference. As a straight man working in San Francisco during the 80s and 90s, I watched the devastation this disease wreaked on friends, colleagues and strangers while the world ignored the issue. This movie gave me an insight into some of the emotional and spiritual struggles of the human beings affected by AIDS. I also loved how the lives of the characters intertwined in unique and sometimes outlandish ways. For me, a truly satisfying film. Most of the reviews express my thoughts better than I. A must see, but schedule 3 hours for each of the 2 DVDs."
1,Political crying game,Stupid pointless movie unless your intent is to punish the Reagan white house for causing aids. We all know that Reagan and the Right wing were responsible and It couldn't have been anyones personal behavior right? All opinions about the subject aside. The movie was choppy and boring most of the time unless you have a fascination with aids and death. They really didn't need the angel.
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"It potraits people with AIDS/HIV as victims or as Angels. Well, there is nothing angelic about an individual who chooses to have sex with others who do not take into account the consequences about irresponsible sex. People get what they have coming to them. This film takes away all the responsibility away from those who have choosen not to be responsible. These people are Not victims, there Are a natural consequence to themselves. Get me a violin. I do have to admit; The acting is great."
1,What a waste,It is a shame that such great actors would lower themselves and play in a movie that was so bad. Don't waste your money.
1,"Brilliant message, flawed delivery.","An otherwise brilliant message for our times has been unfortunately obfuscated with the requisite dereliction of pathos. Quite predictably, any momentary sentiments are regularly overwhelmed with blended social commentary. Maybe someday a vehicle such as this will stand on its own pitard, but sadly, this project seems to be lost in a sea of syrupy contingencies.On the plus side, Pacino's performance is kissed by a neo-pedestrian air of civility, while Emma Thompson is a wonderful example of a tulip in winter. Too bad this play is more like the turtle which must cross the freeway...it doesn't get across."
1,Bored in America,"What a boring, pretentous waste of everyone's time. My husband and I both expected more, considering the stellar cast.How HBO can spend so much time, money, and effort on such an insignificant topic is beyond me.Very Disappointing."
1,Boring,"I saw this DVD at the video store and thought it might be interesting to watch. The DVD box did not say what the movie was about, but I decided to rent and it and watch it at home. After watching the film, I was shocked that this film had won so many awards. I had a hard time watching this movie all the way thorugh because it was so boring. Watching movie about people with AIDS was extremly depressing. Also, I could not believe the pervertiveness of this movie. I would have to say that this movie is a bore sick movie."
3,But no extras???,"I have waited years - maybe even a decade? - for a film adaptation of this play. I was thrilled to find out HBO was producing it and I loved the production. I was disappointed, however, to buy the DVD and find NO additional material. A DVD of this significance should contain some commentary, a documentary, a history. I understand HBO was in a rush to release the film, but I don't think it would have killed them to allow us to gain a little more insight. There are plenty of documentaries in existence already about AIDS and the play that they could have easily tacked on. Why, HBO, why? Sometimes I just don't get you. . ."
5,"life first hand, with lots of stage.....","wonderful motivation. a wonderful movie. ranks with magnolia, under the tuscan sun, donnie darko, and the band played on...*WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
5,magical,"It's jsut wonderful, magical, great.... with great actors and actresses. Specially Meryl Streep, who plays 3 very different roles in it. I saw it some time ago, but I had to buy it for my collection."
2,Never Judge a DVD by its Cover,"I recently purchased this movie based on the box itself and was surprised to see a great cast- Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, and some recognizeable B actors. Despite a good cast, this was simply a bad movie and very boring to say the least. It attempts to turn every tiny event into something dramatic even though there is a much issue at stake. Then, almost every scene with an angel in it is just ridiculous.Overall, this movie is a chore to get through and demonstrates hope for AIDS victims in a ridiculous way. If you really want this movie , email me and I will send you my copy for free just to prevent you from wasting time/ money on it. Seriously."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Based on a Broadway show, it is a good movie if you think of it as a film about how man handle crisis, the problem is that the script has too much Broadway on it, and when you do this in a movie it ends up looking overacted, exaggerated and too artistic. This is for me the main problem of ""Angels in America"", eventough I am a miniseries fan, I had to see this movie in almost 3 episodes, you get tired of the slow moving story. I wouldn't recomend it for miniseries loves, it is more for artistic or conceptual film fans."
5,THe Most Poetic Screenplay I've Ever Seen,"As a poet, I'm very much into the way language is expressed. You don't find a lot of that in mainstream cinema, and especially not on TV.Except on HBO.Whatever your views may be about AIDS, issues aside, the way the characters in the film express themselves is a work of art in itself, walking the fine line of stylish expression, without going over the heads of the common man.I want to see more intelligently written pictures like this on the big screen."
3,"Well Performed , but just Lack of Attraction!","All the actors and actresses no doubtfully well performed in this TV show, but it is just lack of that certain attraction to drag me watching it till the end.Maybe if this short TV show was convert into a regular 1.5-2 hours film, the result could have turned out better?"
3,Angels in America- Better on Stage,"I really enjoy Angels in America. As a play, it is wonderful, and does a lot of things that can be translated really well to the stage. However, I don't feel that the HBO version really did the show justice. First of all, Kushner suggests that the audience see the magic- the strings holding up the fantastic things that happen. Secondly, I don't believe Justin Kirk did a very good job as Prior. He lost some of the WASP-y wit that is so necessary in the character. Yes, he is dying of AIDS, but he doesn't want pity. I did think there were some great performances, mind you, but I would rather see it on stage where it was meant to be seen."
3,"Bigger than Life - and Pretentious, too!","I actually expected to really like this, as I'm very involved in the LGBT community and very much enjoyed ""And the Band Played On,"" which deals with a similar topic. But, really, I don't think ""Angels in America"" is very good. A lot of it is pretentious and overly theatrical. The Republicans are all evil (except for the one good Republican, who eventually sees the light) and the gay characters are all witty and clever and charming.Stereotypes are boring, regardless of which side is being stereotyped. And oversimplifications don't promote useful dialogue about important issues. Frankly, this isn't a movie; it's a lecture. If you like being lectured at, then you'll enjoy this experience. If, however, you prefer 3-dimensional characters and appreciate subtlety, then this movie will probably irritate you no small amount."
2,I REALLY wanted to like it!,"I don't know . . . I REALLY wanted to like this miniseries. I love the actors. I love the director. I've heard the play was amazing (although I didn't see it). I love HBO and how daring they are. I'm a big Indie-movie fan. I'm liberal. I don' know . . .I just didn't like it. I watched the entire series on HBO, never giving up on it because I kept thinking the ""Ah ha!"" would come. But it didn't. I felt like EVERYONE over-acted. I felt like the story dragged. I thought the Mary Louise-Parker character was unbelievable.I don't know . . . I REALLY wanted to like it."
2,Not very good.,"There are some very good reviews of this DVD here, which really surprised me. I was disappointed to say the least. There are some very unlikable characters in this movie, and combined with the very boring plot, I just couldn't get into it.If you want to really see something well done about Angels, I can heartily recommend ""Charlie's Angels"", which puts this project to shame."
2,"Great cast, hope you like gay men stories...","Very disappointing. You get to spend several hours watching the story of several gay men that are either dying or finding new lovers. There's also weird ghost and supernatural stuff happening, but it doesn't seem have a point. One visit from an 'angel' turns out to be a rather pagan and sex based visit.This is a series where you keep expecting there to be a good point for everything happening and there isn't."
1,Porn and bigotry,This movie is porn and bigotry plain and simple. There is no artistic vlaue whatsoever. Don't waste your time or money. The NR is extremely deceptive and should be X rated.
1,"Revolutionary, but Revolting","Sadly, the best thing I can say about watching this DVD is ""I'm glad I didn't pay for any tickets during the hurricane"".When one sits down to watch a movie, she shouldn't have to be projectionist, ticket taker, usher, and critic all in one phase of history. Al Pacino can act like there is no tomorrow, but that doesn't make him a writer at the dawn of time. Likewise, Meryl Streep was not a baseball player. To imply (as this DVD does), that some kind of extra-terrestrial uranium force was responsible for the AIDS epidemic is more then irresponsible, it is downright anti-thought-provoking.On the positive side, the six actors who were at the forefront of this drenching catacomb did give the utmost sincerity in all known dimensions (and I believe there are four dimensions)."
1,Tired tirade,"This ""movie"" is an endless rant against anything and everything that is NOT pro homosexual, pro democratic socialism, and pro cultural marxism. Pure propaganda for the anti-family, ant-religon crowd. Save your money."
5,We should have elected Erickson president in 1968.,"If you have any interest at all in Roky Erickson, I highly recommend this set. Some of these songs are so beautiful they'll stop you in your tracks. Get this thing and stick it in your CD machine; you won't be sorry."
1,Pick another book,"This was a very disappointing book. The author may have been a fine CIA Operative, but an interesting author he is not. He was not into sharing much detail of ""spook"" type work. This was more a descriptive political analysis of the countries in which he was assigned and a moralistic soapbox against those agents (rightfully so) that turned into traitors. The book itself was almost void of any specific operations and their analysis."
4,"Skilled writer and historian, however....","For the most part, I enjoyed this book, especially the writing itself. However, toward the last third it began to drag with too much detail. I skipped over a lot of it, just wanted to be finished with the book. And there were a few too many points of view."
2,Potentially powerful story ruined by unschooled author.,"This story of a family's trip to and their life in ""Eye-tee,"" Indian Country, Oklahoma, has the potential to be a masterpiece. The biblical allusions are a nice touch, but weren't used very masterfully. Perhaps Rilla should have saved this powerful story for another day and time when she was a better versed author."
1,An Absolute Snorer,"Ugh...after slogging through 420 pages, the end result was that I didn't give a hoot about any of the characters and am furious that I wasted my time reading this!!!!"
5,Great,"I ordered this book for just a few dollars and I really wasn't expecting it to be in the good condition that it was in. It came in just a couple of days, the paper wasn't written on or torn. I'm so glad to finally be getting into shape before my wedding!"
1,package not received,"Even though it's 9th February 2011, I still haven't received the DVD and am worried about this situation. I have ordered so many DVDs from Amazon site, and all of them were received by me, way before the expected date of delivery which is indicated in the website. This is the very first time, I have still not received a package which I ordered by Amazon.com. So please inform me on the progess of this shipment.Thank you."
2,Hard to trust this guy!,"I purchased this book after having purchased the 12 second sequence book also by jorge cruise.Each time I have been led to believe by Mr cruise that this is the ultimate workout,in the 12 second sequence he states that twice a week for twenty minutes is the best way to get the best body however in this new book its 3 times a week for over 30 minutes.It is very difficult to trust this guy he seems to change his story with each book stating that a monday wed friday plan is what he follows which goes against what he said in 12 second sequence in which he says twice a week with two days between workouts!I just really dont know what to believe with this guy!He now promotes 15 grmas of sugar or less perday and 6 carb portion of no more than 20 grams each but in the recent past he sold Jorge Cruise shakes in a can that had massive amounts of sugar way more than 15 grams in just one shake!!!!I have had it with this guy some of his ideas are great but he just seems like a huckster!!!!"
3,Simple exercises,"I think Jorge Cruise is wonderful, and his advice to cut sugar and carbs works for me. But this book is just a description of simple exercises to do with bands and an exercise ball. It would be fine for someone who's never used this equipment, but for a ""gym rat"" like me it was not very helpful."
4,Body at Home - Practical,"I had not heard of Jorge Cruise before I read his book, since I have read every weight-loss books that comes out, why not this one. I was hoping something would click this time. Well, I truly enjoyed the practicallity of this book. I think I got it - same message but stated so logically that it really hit home this time. What I got from it was that I can eat my regular foods just use portion control. Great, Great! form for tracking what you eat. He gives you the portion - you fill in the blank. I have memorized the form and it really works for me. I have been following the princples and I have lost 6 pounds. It just makes sense and gives structure."
1,Not for Nano 5th Gen,This dock is completely incompatible with 8 GB Nano 5th Generation. Will not charge and audio out does not work.
5,Great product!,"Unfortunately, Apple got cheap and stopped including docks in the purchase of a brand new Ipod, but this is a fantastic alternative. I really only use it to charge my Ipod, but it's great to have a designated place to put it where it will get charged."
4,Great Dock for the iPod,"I just bought an iPod 5g with video, and needed a way to charge it and play it at the office. I went to the electronics store in search of an Apple dock, but they were out so I bought the Maxell P-3 unit instead. It turned out to be a great choice...less expensive for more features. There are multiple connection options, incuding an audio output, USB and Firewire. It works great. The only con is the package did not include a base converter for the 5G video iPod (hey, its only been out a week), but an email confirmed that they are in the works and will be out shortly. The dock is not compatible with teh adapter that was provided with the iPod packaging.If you want to save a few bucks and snag a great product, give this one a look...."
2,Works only some with Ipod Touch,"I didn't read too closely before purchase, but I have an Ipod Touch 4g.**This item only works as a sync/charge dock.Details when using with an Ipod Touch:- The A/C adapter doesn't work to charge (you see the ""Charging not supported"" message)- connected to a PC or a USB power adapter this DOES charge/sync the Ipod Touch- the firewire can be used for sync, although I didnt test that- lineout/video out are NOT enabledSo my review is this: since a second charge/sync cable is more expensive than this item, go for it with the understanding that it has limited functionality. IF you have older Ipods as well then this should be great."
3,NOT FOR THE 2G IPOD TOUCH !!,"Long story short... this charger is not compatible with the 2G Touch. You will see an error message saying ""charging hardware not supported"" I tried this charger with my 2G nano and it works beautifully. Slim profile, everything works the way it is supposed to and one of the few docks I've noticed that have a backing to help support some of the weight. All in all a great product if it was only compatible with the Ipod touch 2G."
1,Not compatible with all ipods,"Contrary to the description on Amazon and the company's webpage, this product is not compatible with all ipods. If you have a newer ipod, you should probably look elsewhere."
1,False description,"When I plugged my nano into this device a message was displayed that ""charging is not supported with this device""."
4,"Good pricing, nice looks... not designed with Nano in mind.","I called Maxell when I looked into this product to make sure it worked with the ipod nano. In my mind when I asked this I was meaning to ask if there was a nano attachment; there is not, but it does WORK, it just doesn't cradle my ipod as I had hoped. Otherwise, it works well, looks cool and sounds fine. I also like that there is a firewire, usb, line out and ac connector all in the back. It truly makes this unit ""universal."" Worth the price and a good alternative to the expensive Apple docks. One thing that has bothered me however is that whenever I touch my ipod, and it is in the dock, it shocks me quite sharply. It's not once or twice either, it's EVERY time. I wouldn't let that deter you from the product though. Good buy."
4,"Nice dock, but......","I received the dock yesterday all seemed fine when i set it up. I am only using the power supply and the line out to go to some powered speakers on my headboard...so I can't comment on the other supplied cables. All seems fine, but I noticed that every so often the backlight on the Ipod comes on by itself while playing. Also, there is a blue charging light that is supposed to indicate the unit is charging, but after my Ipod shows charged, the light remains on - in fact it comes on when you dock, and never goes out. I don't know if I have a faulty unit concerning these issues or if that is just how it works - and it DOES work."
1,Doesn't work with my iPod,"My iPod does not fit snugly on this charger, even though I selected what appeared to be the correct base. Any ideas for help? Otherwise, I'm going to send back. My iPod doesn't get charged even if it's on the charger for hours."
1,"Universal? HAAA, pooo on that!","Ok, normally I am cautious when I buy anything with the word ""universal"" in it. But, since I had an iPhone, iPod Touch, and a Nano...i figured one of these devices would work....NAAAA! Well, ok the Nano works with it, but with all the attachments I was really hoping that my iTouch would work but of course not. And when I say it doesn't work with my devices it won't charge play, nothing! Oh and the remote is udderly a worthless POS. You can't see it cuz it's black on black! Who the hell puts a remote together with a black background AND black keys?!? Insanity...All in all, I got what I paid for.....took a chance on a universal dock that didn't even come close to doing squat for me. Maybe it will work for you but make sure you read what is compatible first.:(Diddy..."
3,ok for the money.,"Luckily these headphones weren't very expensive, otherwise I would be much more disappointed. They are not very comfortable, especially for people with a ""larger than average"" head. They sound pretty good, but aren't loud enough for me. When I use them running, I hear WAY too much of my heavy breathing, and not enough of my music. I like that they only have one wire going to the headpiece, but I still manage to snag that one wire with my hand while I run, and yank them off my head. No wires is probably my next step."
2,painful to wear,"sound quality is so so, but my real gripe with these headphones is that they actually give me headaches. the plastic band ""grips"" the back of your head right behind your earlobes. this gets very uncomfortable after a while."
2,Sound cuts out after under 3 months,"After light use (less than once a week) for under 3 months the sound began to cut out. I noticed it would cut out over 80% of the time I was listening either entirely, or a large portion of the sound range would suddenly dissapear. Usually mid range (vocals) and below would cut out. If the cord was held just right it would come back for a few seconds but then cut back out. Also, they are slightly tight on the ears while wearing glasses."
2,They Hurt!,"These earphones hurt my neck, they hurt my ears and the quality is okay at best. I do not recommend them for exercise at all!"
1,worst sound ever,"I simply could not believe how bad the sound is. No bass whatsoever, thin tinny midrange. Went from the box directly to the trash bin. I cannot imagine how this junk got 3 starts here."
3,These earphones hurt!,"I'm normally a stickler for neckphones such as these. The problem I have found with these? They really hurt!I wear glasses, and can't wear glasses and these at the same time without the headset feeling like it's going to pull my ears off.I even tried it without my glasses, and it was still trying to cut off the circulation on my ears.These are not for long term use. If you want a set of headphones, and are going to use them for only a half hour, get them. If you are going to listen to your music for several hours, don't! Save your money and get either earbuds, or headphones that do not hook over your ears, as these do.The upside if you're not into long term use? The sound is great on these.Sony is usually the best, but they really need to go back to the drawing board on this one. :("
5,Long-lasting and good sound,"I just ordered a second pair of these due to the great experience I had with the first pair I've used for the last two years or so. I use these exclusively for exercise, and I run distance outside, so these have taken quite a beating, including hot, cold, sweat, rain, and snow. After so much use, the plastic that goes behind the ears has broken, but the headphones still work just fine. I can definitely recommend these for exercise use outdoors, and if the pair you get is anything like mine, they will last you quite a while!"
2,"Sound Pretty Good , Painful to wear","I like behind the head phones.The are not as a group as comfortable, but it's a trade off for fit, and stability. These sound good but really hurt after a short while, as the plastic wings press on ears ,which are, as we know , tender. Maybe they have different shaped ears on Vulcan. Wish they still made my old Koss 55's."
4,"awsome, but to much leakage and too expensive for the quality","I have used this type of headphone for years, they last a long time and they have really good quality for the price they USED TO BE. These headphones used to be much cheaper then they are charging on here, and I'm sure you can find them cheaper with a google search. These headphones served me well, for people who don't like ear buds I would definitely recommend them if you don't want to spend a lot. But like I said they leak in and out, you can hear outside noises unless you turn them up very loud, in which case people around you get annoyed because the sound leaks out and they can hear it loudly. After a few months of use the padding deteriorates and breaks up and falls off, which makes the headphones very uncomfortable. I loved these headphones for so long, but technology has improved and you can get much better quality for the same price. I recommend Sennheiser CX300, they are very very good, and around the same price. (google search)"
2,Very average headphones.,"I got these headphones three months ago. They are working fine inspite of my rough handling and the sound quality is quite ok. Actually, that's what you get for that price. :-)However, the main reason for low rating of this product is that they are very uncomfortable if you plan to use them for more than an hour or so. Your ears and back of head starts to pain."
4,Awesome... 4.5!!!,"I love my streetstyle phones. No earbuds ever fit on my ears, so I got these, and I catn believe the durability! I wrap the cord around either side of the plastic to store them, although i shouldnt, and theyre fine. I tug on the cord end, it doesnt break... The foam on the phones is broken, but theyre still awesome. 1 complaint though: SLIGHTLY, very SLIGHTLY uncomfortable. Overall, great though. BUY THEM"
3,"Great Sound, But Break Easily","I have been using these headphones for years ... through probably 6 or 7 sets. I used to keep one set at home and one at work. The sound is great, I have always been happy with them for music, computer use and talk radio.The only problem I am having is a recent one. The connection from the left earpiece to the right earpiece is consisantly breaking. So I am left with a set of headphones that only works on the left side. Its happened on the last 3 sets I have used. This is my one and only complaint."
3,Decent,"Good for the price. Sound is decent, but you can do a lot better. Music has a tendancy to leak out because of the design, so be warned if you like your volume turned up. You feel the pressure on your ears right away when you first put these on, but the discomfort kicks in about an hour into your use."
4,Worth Mulling Over,"This is not a book that calls for underlining and highlighting, but it definitely has value as a basis for reflecting on various aspects of collaboration, and the failure of collaboration, within enterprises.The book is written strictly from the perspective of people and perceptions. It does not have a technical or a financial side and this was disappointing. It would have been more useful to have a book that fully integrated human, technical, and financial success stories and failure stories to present an integrated picture of collaborative work principles in a global economy using the Internet as the backbone for collaborative work.The book is well-written, the figures are useful, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to sit quietly on an airplane and think about the authors' subtitle: why links between business units often fail, and how to make them work."
2,Overpriced (if you can still find one),"Yes, I bought one of these and it does hold the player perfectly. The belt clip is firm and keeps in place very well. The problem? It's a rip-off at $30. The thing is so small, you'd better hope you never accidentally crush it with your weight. It feels a little cheap, but it complements the style of the player nicely. Seeing as how the NW-HD5 just came out, it's surprising to see these no longer available...unless they've realized how true everything I've just said about it is. Made In China."
1,"So boring, I can't believe I finished this book...","This is one of those books that I started reading, was never gripped, but kept slogging through, figuring it must get better. It never did. The characters were lifeless, had no humanity, were not at all engaging. The story was bleak and not compelling. I read all these reviews that talk about her magificent writing--I never found it."
1,"very slow reading, but beautifully written","If you like good writing, you'll like this book, if you prefer to read books that move along - skip it."
5,love the message and the man behind it,"Shawn Craig is such a wise man, and this book enforces it over and over again. The devotions are perfect for an individual or a couple and speak loud and clear to someone at any level of their walk. Well done!"
1,Ahmed Osman ripped off,"Yet another of this author's bulleted lists of unsubstantiated facts. Ahmed Osman's work is stripped to a few sentences and presented as fact with no backing. And if you've read Gadalla's first work, Historical Deception, you may notice you are reading a carbon copy of some of the chapers in it, repackaged and retitled."
1,Meatless theory,"I came to this theory via the Caesar/Christ parallels. And of the two, Caesar wins out. The oriental archetype of the 'king' is no conspiracy or coincidence. What great hero wasn't born under divine supervision, fought opposition and died a venerated death? One could make a similar argument with the similarities between Jesus and Superman (or Kennedy, or Charlie Brown), requiring the reader to suspend disbelief less frequently. Worst of all is the offensively thin scholarship pertaining to the Qumran scrolls and the Talmud."
2,"No Respect,, some good info","After about page 35, I lost respect for the author and this book. I study history, Egyptology and Theology. However, it appears to me that facts are certainly twisted in this book.The author USES scripture when it is advantageous to his theory. The scripture used is followed by his PERCEPTION of it taken out of context. The author also purposely misplaces biblical figures in time to make his theory feasible.I'm a firm believer in God and Spirituality. I am not into orthodox religion or doggedness, so I wasn't turned off because of that aspect. I was turned off because the author made facts irrelevant when it was suitable for his theory."
4,All over the guy,After watching this movie I thought that it was very different and funny and it had a fantastic cast to back it up as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
3,"Your typical, light gay movie...","All Over The Guy was a cute movie, although it seems that the formula of boy meets boy movies is becoming the same old boring thing for the movie industry. The best part of this movie was the individual performance of Richard Ruccolo. Aside from being beautiful to look at, he has a charm about him that is difficult to find in any gay movie (except for the wonderful portrayals in the movie Trick). He was normal, natural, and easy on the eyes. Unfortunately, gay stereotypes were still there (alcoholism, overt sexuality, neuroses, flea markets) that for me, a gay man, kinda hindered the overall quality of the movie. Also, the straight couple in the movie (Julie Davis and Adam Rosenberg) had NO SEXUAL chemistry at all, so I didnt believe them for a second. Bottom line: if you want to see Ruccolo in a good role and an average movie, I recommend this."
4,"Cute, not the best, but cute","Like the title says, this movie was cute. Unfortunately, the review gives too much away, but it still nice to watch. The chemistry between the two leads is great and humor is added in just the right spots to give it a good even feel. The only problem about the film was that some of the characters get sort of annoying after a while and the end kind of leaves you feeling as though not all the loose ends have been tied. This is a good movie to see, maybe even buy if you're into gay romances."
5,"Entertaining, funny and touching","Everyone is always entitled to their opinion but what I can say about this movie is that it grabbed me from the opening frame. If you like soap operas, then I think you will enjoy this picture. This movie doesnt try to solve the problems of the world or get too preachy. And yes its predictable. And yes we hope the two gay characters can get their act together by the end of the film. Likable characters, good acting, and an interesting story that keeps us hooked to the end. This movie has all the elements that makes All Over the Guy the great rainy day movie that one can enjoy lounging on the couch."
5,"Outstanding, more true-to-life than anything I've seen ...","What a story! What dialogue! What a cast! Certainly there is a bit of cliché, but for the most part this smacks of realism in a way too infrequently encountered in film, especially in this genre (and clichés, like it or not, do exist in real life!). The storyline is engaging, the actors are so well-cast I felt like I was observing friends in their daily lives.Being that realistic, some people will love this film and some will loathe it, and many will find a happy in-between place in their hearts for this film, which runs the emotional gamut and pushes most of your buttons.Bravo to Dan Bucatinsky and his vision, and bravo to the people who saw the same vision clearly enough to bring it to the screen."
4,Ruccolo Is Breathtaking!!!,"Everything i.e. all the positive reviews said about this film are true.I have to say that Richard Ruccolo is so drop dead gorgeous that every time I look at this film--I still can't get over it.He is among the sexiest actors on film. He's stunning. Not many of the reviews acknowledges this. Yes he is a fine actor to be sure. But his looks...dear God this man is stunning.He has the most gorgeous face, body, eyes, hair.What a hearthrob."
5,'All Over the Guy' is all around perfect,"This is an absolute favorite film of mine. So many aspects about this film are so very well done; The writing, acting, sets, production, score/music, editing, etc. The list goes on and on. Only once in a great while a good movie like ""All Over the Guy"" comes along. Very entertaining for all demographics. Do yourself (and your friends?) a favor and buy this movie for movie night!"
3,Won't kill you,"Yet another film about gays who have problems to make commitments. Nothing new.The plot is predictable, with some weird moments (for example the scene with Lisa Kudrow - ""Friends"" star - brings nothing to the story).I think that the director needed some popular names to appear in his work and here she was.The funny thing is, though, that three of leading characters had also appeared in ""Friends"" serie before:)Acting is o.k. Both Dan Bucatisky and Richard Ruccolo do their best as gays.""All over the guy"" won't do any harm to your life. Good for lazy afternoon, if there's nothing more interesting to do."
3,Ho-Hum Gay Romance,"One thing I always ask myself when I watch a gay-themed film is: Would this be interesting to me if the characters were not gay? All too often the answer is no, and unfortunately All Over The Guy is one of those films. Will these two guys EVER get together or are they just going to talk about it incessently? I think we all know the answer, so the talk had better be at least interesting enough that we want to stay to the end. It isn't. Too, bad- the performers aren't completely without charm, and the first half hour or so is slightly amusing, but the rest of the film degenerates into one long duet of whining."
2,Ick,"The performances are fine - but the story is just bad. It's not that Richard Ruccolo's character (Tom) is a complete [jerk], it's more that Dan Bucatinsky's (Eli) [isn't very smart]. I'm sure there are some people who are attracted to the wrong guy - but repeatedly?Actually, I have to believe that something must have happened during editing of the film. It is not cohesive. It must have skipped some major points to get from point A to point B then to the ending. And that's just not w/Tom and Eli, but 'Jackie' and 'Brent' too. How did they go from a first date to a wedding in no time flat?Ok for a watch - but not worth a purchase."
3,Ok movie if there's nothing better available,"This movie didn't break any new ground for gay flicks, in fact, I kept mistaking it for other gay flicks. While it wasn't bad, it doesn't ever seem to end - in other words, there's probably 3 times you'll be waiting for the credits to roll. It's not bad for something to get at the video store - but look harder for something better before you do."
3,"Real Guys, Real Funny","My partner and I both liked this movie. We were both impressed that the main characters are written as complex... and not just idealized fantasies on the screen. They each have quirky character traits, are not perfectly coiffed, and react to situations in believable ways. The script is funny and touching. The two stars did a great acting job, particularly during the scene with Tom's bitter parents. We also liked the supporting cast, especially Sasha Alexander, Andrea Martin and Lisa Kudrow. The movie isn't great ""Art"" but it's good entertainment."
4,a movie that's not about movie stars,"You ever notice how cute and ideal gay men are in movies and shows today? At least here we get a truly messed up couple that lives happily ever after. Gives us all a little more hope I think. At times predictable, at times a little stupid, but there's only so much one can do with a romantic comedy. I've seen stuff like this go on in real life, you know? Well, that's my two cents."
4,A real relationship,"While this quirky flix won't cure cancer or help put human life on mars, what it does do is paint a somewhat honest portrait of a modern gay relationship. A love story full of bumps and bruises, arguments and friendship. This comedy/drama is for anyone who loved ""When Harry Met Sally"", but wished they were both men."
1,HEARD IT WAS GREAT. BOUGHT IT. SAVE YOUR $$$$!,Not a great film for these talented actors. I have seen several of their other films and they were very good in their roles. This film on the other hand is LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG and CIRCULAR. BANALITY would have been a better name for the film. Save your money and buy me something nice instead!
1,Can I enter 0 stars?,"Was I watching a bad sitcom on Friday night or this film? Was I watching Step by Step with Suzanne Somers? It was hard to tell. My God, are we that hard up for glimpses of gays on film that we will be satisfied with terrible movies like this? The number of stars is misleading everyone!"
1,All Over the Vomit,This is the most shallow piece of junk that I have ever seen. It tries to sell it self of as an art house flick but it is from a major releasing company with bad hollywood acting and actors (cristina richee) and overloaded with over - the - top political correctness. It is a waste of celluloid and the plot is like a bad t.v. show. This film is insulting to anyones eyes and ears.
1,"Ugh, ugh, ugh","Life according to ALL OVER THE GUY:1. Straight people are stupid.2. Gay people only speak in sitcom quips.3. People who have absolutely nothing in common will fall in love and live happily ever after.4. Alcoholic, studly hunks are innately attracted to nerdy, PLANET OF THE APES-obsessed queens.5. Random strangers are just DYING to hear about your relationship problems.6. The boyfriend of the writer/director of THE OPPOSITE OF SEX and BOUNCE can get his script produced based on no other merit than who he's dating.Enjoy."
4,Precious live Lady Day with good band (if you could hear Getz),"Mid-fi sound, probably from AM broadcast,a few pops and clicks. Billie enjoyed a good band including a very young Stan Getz on sax and Buster Young on piano (the only musician heard up front, or really at all). Billie is in pretty good voice here, and sings many of her greatest tunes, such as ""Lover Man"", ""Strange Fruit"", and ""Miss Brown To You"". All of the tunes are very short versions (19 songs, well under an hour). ""My Man"", taken at a super slow tempo, and ""Strange Fruit"" (a rather poetic account of a racial lynching)are especially poignant. The vocal nuances in each tune show why Billie is still revered to this day, while many jazz/blues vocalists of the era have been long forgotten. Strangely restrained audience, polite applause at end of songs. Highly recommended, if the sound quality doesn't bother you. Five star performance, one star ""mix"", two and a half star overall sound. Great cover shot.But is the saxman Stan ""Guess""?"
4,Great Guitar But.............,i bought this guitar back in january this year and i still play it every day the neck plays fast with medium action and it has great soundind pickups the guitar looks great but it gets small dents and scratches super easily beacause of the really soft mohogany body. but thats great if you want your guitar to eventually look like a truly loved and played instument not just a looker P.S.. if your cry over scratches this is not your guitar
3,Not great.,This book is ok. It's not great. My son loves the pictures but the wording is a little too redundant.
3,Spunky heiress and really quiet hero,"While I typically enjoy historical and fantasy more than contemporary romance, I enjoy the montana series by Harlequin Intrigue. The settings and politics are a lot more believable than most.Whitney McNair, the heiress, is spunky, adaptable and intelligent and easy to identify with.Her hero, yes he literally is, is a bit harder understand as Vincent Romeo is more silent than most 'silent types.'Since this is the concluding book of the series it has a satisfying end.Don't miss the rest of this series. You won't be disappointed. The books weave closely together and you miss something individually."
3,How do you find God on the Net?,"I think it is a generally very interesting book, although there are many excellent Christians sites that are not listed. Some possibly because - by its nature - a printed book is more out-of-date than its online counterpart.Some of its reviews are rather subjective, but an inevitable bias towards a particular viewpoint will always creep in to any publication - This is not necessarily always a bad thing. A personal poit of reference can help us form our own opinions of Christian web sites."
3,Great 4 the Net,I have found this book extremly usful...I now wonder how I ever lived without it! I have descovered sites I never knew existed and would never have found with out the help of it!
3,Not the Worst,"This is not JJ's weakest album -- that would be ""The Hit List"" (which is still worth giving a listen, actually) -- but it's not that close to her best, either.That said, getting backing from the Beach Boys on ""Fun Fun Fun"" was a stroke of genius, another Jett version of ""Roadrunner"" is always welcome, ""This Means War"" isn't bad...And the title cut is Incredible> If ""Good Music"" was theonly listenable cut among a mass of repulsive garbage, this CD would still rate at least two stars.Joan and the Blackhearts know the history of rock'n'roll, and they demonstrate that fact here, with a quick musical tour of the genre that reaches a conclusion that i reached some time ago -- ""I could be all right if I could hear a loud guitar all night!""Long Live Good Music!Long Live Joan Jett!"
3,Hasty recording,"Recorded very quickly by Jett, just after she completed her acting chores for ""Light Of Day"", Joan signed to a new label and gave them a soft, hurried sell. The title track(despite some forced, car-commercial uplift)is tuneful(and much better here than on the butchered-for-time 45 release)and ""If Ya Want My Luv"" is decidedly ominous, but new fans of Jett's won't appreciate this album being layered in a sugar-coating that gets repetitive, at times even annoying. And the record is awfully brief--couldn't they have issued this with some outtakes(the B-side of ""Good Music"" was ""Fantasy"", which ended up on FLASHBACK)?"
4,a definite Joan Jett buy,this album may be even better than Up Your Alley ... and that's saying a lot. The songs that aren't absolutely great (most of them) are better than her usual not-great songs ...
5,fabulous,This was one of the best buys of the decade for me. I LOVE this. It is exciting and beautiful and I never get tired of hearing it. If you like thrilling music this is the CD to own.
5,eye-opening,"After reading Divorce: Causes and Consequences, I have gained a better perspective on what the real effects of divorce is and all the different types of attributes go into a relationship. This book is very easy to read but doesn't skip out on all the details. It is filled with statistics and descriptions making it so informative. The book is up-to-date with information that pertains to relationships now, not old statistics making me guess what I could be now. Its a definate must read for anyone because everyone should know how they fit into a relationship and what they can do to make it last! Brentano did a great job with this book as well as her other book Divorce Lessons. Take a look at both!"
5,Highly recommended!,This book is a really insightful book that helped me understand the complicated process of divorce. The book has really opened up my eyes to what I need to take into consideration for relationships in my own life. The concepts discussed in the book were easy to understand especially with the recent research findings that were provided. It may be useful to those who plan on getting married to have a closer look at their divorce risks. I really recommend this book to anyone that wants to have a better understanding of divorce.
5,"Review of: ""Divorce, Causes and Consequences""","Prior to reading the literature found in this text I was unaware of so many risk factors and characteristics commonly associated with ""at-risk"" marital companions. Not to say that the book steers readers away from the idea of marriage, rather it highlights facts that everyone in a serious relationship should take into account upon entering a lifelong commitment. I feel that I have personally benefited from the material in this book and believe that anyone in a relationship or in a marriage needs to purchase this book. Understanding the evolutionary process of divorce, statistical facts regarding the subject and ways to avoid the dissolution of a marriage are key facts that can alter one's life and I feel that I am at an advantege after having read this text."
2,Out-of-Date,"As a fan of Yankee Stranger written by Elsworth Thane, I found this book tivial and out-of-date. Yankee Stranger is full of history and a good love story. The love story in From This Day Forward seems unreal. The situations are out-of-date as are the characters. This was a skim-through book and then delete."
1,Retrograde Romance,"After a strong first chapter, readers who have become accustomed to the strong female protagonists in Thane's Williamsburg series will slowly turn green at the antics of talented nitwit Elizabeth Dare and her beloved accordian-playing ornithologist. To today's readers, the reasons why one or the other must abandon a successful career in order to be happily married will seem obscure, especially given that neither Thane nor her own ornithologist husband did so. Despite some compelling scenes, it is a peculiar and outdated book with a contrived ending."
2,Bobby's lil' book of quotes,"Sized slightly larger than a double CD set, this is not really a book in a traditional sense, except that it is made of paper and bound between two hard covers. This is an assemblage of black and white photos with random thoughts generated by Dylan on various subjects (Example: ""God is woman. You take it from there."" This is superimposed over a b&w; photo of a naked, anonymous, headless woman tastefully covering her torso with her arms.). The quotes are completely without context, except a context imposed by the book's designer, Grant Scott, via the selection of accompanying photo subjects (Allen Ginsberg, Dylan at various ages, Earth as seen from space, etc.)For hardcore collectors or Dylan worshippers only."
1,Bob Dylan: Inspirations,"This is basically an itty-bitty coffee table book (oxymoron, no?) with very little content. Format: Picture and on each facing page a large print quote from Dylan. That's it. Not very many pages, either. If you are inclined to meditate upon each thing he ever said, this may be your book, but I would suggest something with a bit more substance."
5,"Finally, a complilation of the important research on midlife psychology!","As I prepared my talk about the psychological legacy of the Baby Boomer generation, this compilation was an excellent and essential resource. This is the first generation that truly shared an emotional world through the inventions of transistor radios, television and the Internet. Our unique place in American history shaped us in so many ways, but especially psychologically. BE looking for my new book soon which focuses on exactly how Baby Boomers have shaped and defined their psychological legacy."
1,quality print,"I just received my paperback copy this morning. How disappointing to see thatit was just copied pages from an original printed book. The black lines of thecopied page edges show, the print is varied from light ink to barely readable.This was to be a present for my brother. I have a printed copy fromlibrary in my hands and it is perfectly easy to read and evenly printed. Your descriptiononline should have warned me that it was copied pages from a printedbook!chicky"
5,"The performance is fierce, the music is transcendant","Shostakovich's 10th Symphony has been performed very well on many recordings, but this is one of the greatest of all of his recorded works. Herbert Von Karajan's fierce, mathematical brilliance is suited perfectly to Shostakovich's coded masterpiece."
4,Impressive,"I am usually not a fan of Karajan's. But this recording of Shostakovich's 10th Symphony is different. The Berlin Philharmonic plays as brilliant as ever, the interpretation is very intense (but always somewhat controlled as e.g. in the ""Scherzo""), the sound rich, full and well recorded, the tempi are balanced: Yes, this recording can be recommended.Shostakovich's #10 is another ""great"" Symphony where he seems to be able to express his personal emotions and perceptions in the musical language that is acceptable to the ruling class. Nonetheless, the notes are genuine Shostakovich: The triumph is no triumph, the DSCH (D-E flat-C-B) is in clear opposition to the brutality described, the ""Scherzo"" is a ""portrait of Stalin""."
4,"Pretty good overall, but not absolutely best","Well spotted, John Grabowski! Indeed, the clarinet is a touch late in its second phrase in the 1st movement. Very sloppy for BPO under hyper-autocrat HVK!The sound at the very opening of this symphony is very poor (lots of hiss included). But it gets over that quickly. Also, in tuttis the early digital sound is bad at times. So not an absolutely wonderful recording in all respects.I would recommend Jansons on EMI for a recording which is brilliant in sound and interpretation (much prefer it over this)."
3,Wheres the musical substance?,"How ambivalent Shostakovich must have felt to hear his symphony played by ... Herbert von Karajan. The picture of the two men inside the liner notes, shows a awkaward Shostakovich, grimacing and stiff while speaking to Karjan, but not looking directly at him. Karajan on the other hand, looks oblivious, content to just smile. Thw two men obviosuly dont connect, either personally, ideologically, or musically.Karajan has a way of soothing over the anger, the bitter resoluteness of this music. Listen to the intial Climax of the first movement (3""52). The music falls flat, the passage is a simple musical development for Karajan. Listen to Ormanady's protrayal of the same climax and the two men are worlds apart.Dont fall for DG marketing. Karajan is hardly a great conductor.For the DS 10th, look to Eugene Ormandy, Evgeni Mravinsky, Simon Rattle, and Mariss Jansons before Karajan!"
5,AN AWESOME GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS,"I'm so happy to have purchased this CD! En Vogue is back with a new line-up sounding better than ever. The group vocals seem actually stonger and I think new memeber Amanda Cole was a perfect choice!The CD is very groovy, upbeat, exciting, and there are songs for eveyone! The music, lyrics, and the harmony couldn't be better!My favorites songs are: Have Yourself A Merry Little ChristmasThat's What Christmas Means To MeThis ChristmasChristmas With My HoneyTHIS IS A MUST HAVE CD!!!"
5,Excellent,"I don't know where Rob got his listening skills from but he is not a good source for good music. This CD is Very Good. It has something for everyone. Amanda Cole is an excellent addition to the group. She has a beautiful voice and I encourage people to listen to the CD themselves and form thier own opinion. If this Rob character feels that it is that bad, he should sing his own Christmas CD and show us how it is supposed to sound. The songs ARE true to the Envogue sound and the harmonies are still there. I truly recommend this christmas CD for your collection."
5,FRANK SANTO DOMINGO,"I KNEW FRANK SINATRA.....&....HE WAS VERY KIND TO ME..(WHEN BING CROSBY ASKED HIM TO HELP ME GET STARTED, AFTER MY 2 YEAR ARMY HITCH.)...............(BING SAW ME SINGING IN SAN FRANCISCO, DURING MY ARMY HITCH & GAVE ME HIS ADVICE & TEL #)...).............&..I WAS IN SANTO DOMINGO, IN 1973, & WE STAYED AT ""LA ROMANA"" RESORT, WHILE PREPARING TO FILM ""GODFATHER, PART 2"" IN THE CITY OF SANTO DOMINGO, AT THE OUTDOOR THEATER IN THE CENTER OF TOWN.........I WAS THE LOCATION MGR ON THE FILM........& I DONT THINK THE""ALTO DE CHAVON"" AMPITHEATER WAS BUILT THEN......OR I AM SURE THAT DIRECTOR FRANCIS COPPOLA WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED FILMING THERE.........& THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY ""BEST"" LIVE CONCERTS THAT MR.

4,It's cheap + it works + it's easy to use = it's GREAT,"The only drawback it that it doesn't have an over-the-ear hook so it feels like the earbud is about to fall out of your ear. It hasn't -- yet -- but I only use it while driving, which is less active than walking around. (Got it because WA passed a handheld-while-driving law, and I drive a stick shift, which requires both hands for driving)"
3,Old technolgy but it works,The earbuds do work with good sound but they are a little uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Unfortunately this is the only earbud available for this phone.
1,disaster!!!!!,"i pluged the handfree into my cell phone and it didnt work, upon taking it out the tip broke off in my phone and now the phone doesnt work! i called customer service and they said they would look ointo it and call me back-they never did!"
4,It works fine,"Hi,I bought this 2-3 months back. It works fine for me and I recommend it for its low price and usefulness.Thanks!"
4,review,This is an excellent product. it is very sensative so the person on the other end can always hear you
1,They won't work in 2610s,"I bought 3 and every one of them showed car instead on headphone. This renders them unusable, as the speaker doesn't work. Didn't bother returning since they were cheap, and it was too late. Don't like how when you purchase multiple of the same items at the same time, you STILL get charged separate shipping for each- that way for all Amazon purchases."
1,Waste,This is not the correct ear plug for Nokia 6010...Having difficult time finding the right one...Will continue to look for it
3,Good enough quality for it's purpose,"I've been a professional drummer for 20 years, and this isn't ""pro"" quality, but it doesn't NEED to be either. It's actually better than I THOUGHT it would be."
2,Interesting at best,"I was interested in reading this book for several years, finally just finished it. I did not like it at all. I guess I was expecting a bit more to take out of it then I did. The most interesting part of it was the one section where he becomes tormented with these vivid dreams from his addiction. Aside from that, it was self-involved and all over the place. Things happen in his life and you have no idea what they are and when they happen. He was married and he had children? I get that is part of the addiction process but there are so many loose ends that on top of the writing style it becomes incredibly hard to follow. The whole book is pretty much him rambling on and on and on. I get that he was unhappy in his early years but he sounds like a self indulged whiner. I finished it feeling underwhelmed and bored. I know it is a classic but not for everybody."
4,It's just lamp cord,"This wire is fine, but it's nothing special -- it's just plain old lamp cord with a few audio pins thrown in. You can buy 16 gauge lamp cord at Home Depot, Lowes, OSH, or whatever is near you for a cheap price in very large quantities. The audio pins aren't really needed but you can grab those at most hardware stores too if you really want them (I didn't use them).This product is fine and it won't disappoint you if you're expecting inexpensive no-frills copper cabling for your speakers."
3,Disappointing for the Price,"We purchased these floor mats because (a) they are known for high quality, (b) they are custom-fitted to your vehicle, (c) they cover most of the floor, and (d) they are made in USA. These mats have nothing to hold them in place, except for the hole that goes over the anchor that some vehicles have in the floor (ours does not). Because they are form-fitted and extend all the way from the center hump to the side wall, you would expect them to stay put, but they are fairly thin and lightweight and slick on the bottom and they tend to slide forward and backward. To combat this, we tried using nonskid foam liner, but that didn't work. Then we anchored it to the truck's carpet with screws, with some success, but it is not an ideal solution. These mats would be better is they were made of a heavy, rubbery material or if they had the little spikes on the bottom to hold them in place (like the cheaper mats have). Otherwise, they fit well, look good, and seem to be well made."
3,on death and dying,"if you're planning on dying, or just thinking about it, you might want to check out this disc. the movements pretty much track kubler-ross' famous stages of dying - you know, denial, anger...,acceptance, etc. personally, i didn't find it all that moving. but then again, mahler isn't my cup of hemlock: too pretentious and long-winded."
1,Save your money,"This book was required as supporting material for an OT program. This book is full of mistakes and the diagrams are very hard to follow, misleading, and/or mislabeled. Truly a waste of money, save your money and check it out from the school library and photocopy the darn thing if you have to use it. Useless is an understatement."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"This book has been very poorly edited. It's layout is haphazard and its anatomical illustrations are so poorly rendered as to make them essentially useless. This is surprising given that the publisher (F.A. Davis) is responsible for a large body of excellent medical texts and reference works.This text, now in its 3rd edition, requires 3 full pages of errata. The errata sheets have been produced locally by teachers and students, not supplied by the publisher. My experience would indicate that a complete errata listing could run to 5 or 6 pages, or more!The accompanying lab manual is somewhat useful, but suffers greatly from the same childishly drawn illustrations that are frequently inaccurate, or simply too badly drawn to be helpful."
5,Return of the King (of Spanish Rock),"Charly does it again. He's back and he's holding the crown strongly with both hands.This album is a mix of styles:* Say No More style mixing three songs into a big one(Dileando con un Alma, Rehen, Asesiname)* Hija de la Lagrima style: Linda Bailarina* Influencia style: Asesiname Stone* Hard Rock: VSD & Rock and Roll Yo* Classic Piano: TangoHis masterpieces are VSD & Tango (same lyrics, one being a powerful rock, the other a classic tango, display of his genius), as well as Rock and Roll Yo (hard rock, very rare in Charly).The King is Alive and well. And he has returned."
3,A Less Than Stellar Sequel,"3/4ths of this is very good. It sinks somewhere in the middle with a lot of dialogue about race issues. I understand that the characters need to undergo change. But do you have to give me 40 odd pages of dialogue for me to understand that change? The rest of the novel is pure Updike. Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom is back 10 years after the events of Rabbit, Run. He is still the American everyman. And still very much without a clue about his life. Choosing to allow life to happen to him, rather than make a choice. There is a social commentary weaved into the commentary, this time pinned into the fabric at the tumultous end of the 60s. It's weaved a little too thick here, in some places, so that it feels more like a treatice than the background for a good story.For book and movie reviews go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com"
4,An improvement from the first book in the series,"This book is a significant improvement over the first book in the series and a clear marker of the writer's development. He makes the protagonist, Rabbit (or Harry Angstrom) into a a true anti-hero, someone we really don't like, yet can't help caring what happens to him. Rabbit is 36 in this book and his son is 13. Still struggling with marriage, sex, family and himself, we see a new phase in his life's development. There are strong sexist and racist tones to the book, especially at the beginning, some of which are dealt with by the characters by the end, others which reflect the unfortunate but real attitudes of the times. The middle section of the book gets a bit bogged down in dialogues on political theory, but the rest is fresh and engaging. This book is the best of the three Updike books I've read so far."
3,"Over the top, but a decent read","A good, but not great novel -- the weak link in the chain of the ""Rabbit"" novels. Still worth reading, though.The book would have been as good as the others if the supporting characters were not so embarrassingly stereotypical (especially Skeeter, the almost offensively caricatured unpredictable angry black man). Updike sometimes seems to be trying to get into their heads as effectively as he does with Rabbit's own family, but he doesn't succeed -- and the plot goes over the line into unbelievability too, in my opinion.All that said, this book is full of memorable scenes and characters, and Updike has caught the mood of what a man in Rabbit's situation, and at Rabbit's age, would be feeling. The prose style is also no longer poignant and melancholy like that of ""Rabbit, Run,"" but is more vigorous and sharp--which fits the scene he's setting."
4,A Bit Better,"I think Rabbit Redux is a more accomplished book than Rabbit, Run, and a stronger novel. What looked new and experimental in Rabbit, Run (e.g. the present tense narration) seems in this novel more established - less self-conscious and posturing. The cast of characters also comes across as more solid. Rabbit's parents and his son, Nelson, are in particular well-realised - so that one gets a stronger sense here of Rabbit's role within a family than one did in the first novel. (Who, by the way, portrays adolescents as well as Updike?) And Rabbit Redux is also more of a social history than the more literary Rabbit, Run, faithfully reflecting the racial and political climate of 1960s America. I would read Rabbit, Run first, but I would certainly then recommend reading this one."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book is so bad. I read the first book in the series and felt compelled to continue on with the story. However, the characters in this book were so shallow, lacking any redeeming qualities, I didn't care what happened to any of them. It was very hard to finish, and felt like a huge waste of time. Please save yourself the trouble. If you want to try a John Updike work, I recommend The Witches of Eastwick- (but skip the movie)"
4,First one is way better,"I figured since the first one was great, I wanted to see what happens. Well Redoux is boring. I haven't finished and I had it for almost 2 months"
3,RABBIT REDUX GAVE ME MIGRAINES!!!!!,"John Updike's Rabbit Redux was sadly dissapointing. Though it is fast paced and an often exciting read, it does not accurately portray ""Middle America"" as the book cover proclaims. Affairs, drugs, criminals, a runaway girl --this book has it all, except an ending that's believable. One comes away from this book with less faith in morality, and a sad outlook on the institution of marriage. Indeed the character ""Rabbit"" and his wife ""Janice"" never seem to rise above their stupidity, which,of course, is what we're waiting for them to do. I can forgive Updike since this was written in the '70's, but it's awful"
1,Did not fit,I bought this for my 2007 Cadillac Escalade Esv and the back window deflectors were not the proper size! The front ones fit fine.
4,"A great coffee table book, not an educational tome.","This is a very handsome coffee table book that is great for casual reading while enjoying a fine beer. It is not a volume to raise your beer IQ by any appreciable degree. The ""True Established Expert"" should probably search for ale wisdom elsewhere."
4,Great starter book.,"This book is definitely aimed towards the person who's just starting to dabble in expanding his taste in beers. It's got lots of beautiful photographs and descriptions of beer from around the world. It organizes the beer by type, which is really helpful in focusing your likes and dislikes. It also lists beers by their season of release and by the type of food they go with. The book is extremely user friendly, and as I've already said is generally beautiful. It's a perfect coffee table book. While it should not be your primary reference for all things brewed, it is great for beginners."
2,Hardly Ultimate,"Self-Appointed beer expert Jackson churns out more amateur fluff in this shallow study. Hardly ultimate and hardly scholarship - at least not on the level of Gunderson, Klein, or Passel. Very disappointing to true established experts."
1,Repetitive and tedious.,"I loved the Walking With Dinosaurs/Allosarus/Prehistoric Beasts series so I ordered this based on the Amazon Editorial Review.It does not compare favorably.It appears there wasn't enough animal diversity in America to do a six part series so this series chose to come up with variations on a formula script set in different locals featuring basically the same animals over and over again. Making it even worse is that CGI budget must have been very limited. Shots are reused so often that by the mid point of episode two you are expiriencing deja vue. After that it's like watching stock footage.And speaking of stock footage, there's way too much footage of modern day counterparts to the prehistoric animals.I found my self fast fowarding through the last three episodes looking for something interesting.There wasn't much!The two additional Full length programs weren't much better."
4,Very Helpful,"There are so many Vortex spots in Sedona. We weren't sure where to look, so we bought ""Sedona's Best Vortex Guidebook"" It was very informative. Spots like Airport Mesa and Bell Rock. Each person may feel different things. Don't go expecting to ""feel the power"". Just go visit the areas and enjoy. Afterwards if you notice that you might have felt some extra energy to make up Bell Rock then that was the vortex. In other cases it might just hit you right in the face. Either way, this book is quite helpful for your vortex journies."
3,vortex guide book,"I just got back from Sedona. I had been trying to get there for 10 years, ever since I heard about the energy vortexes.For a place that is famous for the energy vortexes, they seem to be ashamed of them at the same time. LOL You can get all kinds of little maps from the hotels and such. but none of them were specific enough on where the energy vortexes were and where to go to really feel the energy.My husband talked me out of going on one of the jeep tours. and I am glad he did. I bought just to find out where the best place to go to meditate and feel the energy was. and how to actually get to the vortexes. we were at one of the vortexes and one of the jeep tours went by and didnt' even stop. I would have been really upset if I had gone to meditate on the vortexes and they didn't even stop. by the way the author has changed her name because I bought the book there at one of the metaphysical bookstores and it says her name is Jamie Jones."
3,Vortexes,"I was just in Sedona the weekend of 1/2/09 and there are now only three vortexes. Boynton Canyon, Chicken Point, and a new one near the visitors center in Cottonwood. But there are vortexes in every state, discover them for your self!"
3,Less vibration to bikes without it but does hold rack tight!,"At first I was uncomfortable with the rotation of the rack in the hitch as I drove, so I got the stabilizer. After using it, I realized that rotation made the hitch and rack absorb the road bumps. With the stabilizer the bumps are trasmitted into the bike. So now I keep it on, but loose."
4,Excellent resource - look forward to an updated version,"I bought this book for my boyfriend who collects trade tokens.Pro's:1. Great source guide2. Great starting point3. Nice descriptionsCon's:1. Limited photos2. Outdated3. Limited informationConclusion:This is a wonderful book for the novice who is just beginning to collect trade tokens. However, an updated version with color photos, historical background information on the businesses and history on trade token usage along with collecting tips would vastly improve this primitive resource.My boyfriend wound up speaking directly with Mr. Partain, who, we understand, is working on a new edition of this book. Collaborative efforts among collectors could create a wonderful resource for future generations. I would recommend this book for the novice collector!"
5,This book explains virtually everything,"Wright's last book, The Moral Animal, explained most of my life to me. This explains everything else! Wright outlines a drive to greater and greater complexity that isn't necessarily produced by biological evolution (the subject of Moral Animal). It's also the product of cultural evolution. It all seemed quite plausible to me, and well-argued -- Wright can be funny, and he must have read an incredible amount of history and science. This is genuine Big Think, and it will change how you view your place in the grand scheme. Indeed, it shows what the grand scheme is."
2,"Weak arguments, not much empirical data","If you read this book please also read Stephen J. Gould's book ""Full House"". I think Wright's arguments are weak and not supported by empirical evidence. For instance positive feed back ""arms race"" does not explain why bacteria are so numerous. If evolution favors complexity then why are bacteria still, by far, the most numerous life form on this planet after 3.5 billion years?"
3,Tenative Review,"I am having a bit of trouble seeing Wright's ""ghost in the machine"" (I do not doubt that there is one!) but is Wright trying to emphasize 'emergence and chaos theory as the ""elan vital"" for human evolution? I will re-read-but it seems to me that conclusions are scarce in Wright's Non-Zero. I think the problem is that I tend to aim for reductionist analysis (gear A turning Spindle B) and Wrights more or less Holistic perspective-which is equally true but damn hard to demonstrate."
2,when right trite when nocel wrong,"This book is a pretentious regurgitation of a half-digested science. The logic of the book goes like this. First, cooperation problems are ubiquitous in social and economic interactions (a common place idea). Second, human societies cope with these problems by devising institutions aimed at detecting cheaters and spreading information about them (also a common place idea barely worth repeating). And third, successful cooperation not only creates immediate material gains, but also gives rise to the need of more cooperation as some interactions that were hitherto impossible become viable (this idea, despite being the key for the whole book, is barely stated and never convincingly proved). If you want to write about science, it makes sense to use some method. State your hypothesis first and then show the evidence. Wright mixes up theory and evidence, perhaps knowing that his arguments wouldn't withstand any serious scrutiny."
4,The Limits of Natural Teleology,"For an excellent review of this book by William A. Dembski, author of ""Intelligent Design"", see the August/September 2000 edition of First Things magazine, pg 46."
2,noninteresting,"The purported thesis of this book is that non-zero-sumnass seems to be norm during our existance. The whole first half of the book is spent pointing out things like two neanderthals working together proved better than two neanderthals in competition. No kidding. I think it's obvious that every situation involving two entities doesn't have to end with a ""winner"" and a ""loser"". Finally in the second half of the book, he gets into concepts that may be new to some people, such as the idea of memes and cultural evolution. However, there are much better books out there on these topics, since they are only touched upon here for fifty pages or so. I also know why ""Bill Clinton called the book astonishing and fascinating and instructed White House staff members to read it."" It's because at the end of the first part, Wright discusses how society might choose to concede many personal liberties in order to feel generally safe, and that this won't necessarily bring about 1984. Whatever."
5,Higher purpose,"I first heard about Non-Zero when I heard President Clinton refer to it enthusiastically in a speech, earlier this year, in which he cited how we are here on this earth, hopefully working for a higher purpose. I bought the book and read it and found it inspiring and compelling, especially realizing that the President had read it and been impressed with it, and gleaned and cited this particular insight. The Economist review cited on the dust cover of the book says, in part, ""This clever and stimulating book is destined to become a classic.... Like Charles Darwin's On the Origin of the Species and Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene, it could well change the way people think and feel about their lives -- perhaps even how they behave... An intellectual entertainment argued with wit and style."""
5,Excellent Read,"I read his prior book The Moral Animal, and found Nonzero proof that someone who can write one good nonfiction book has at least one more in him. As an economist I appreciate the prominence given to game theory, as it lurks above everything (in the book and in life!). He writes in a compelling, fair, and entertaining way: classic popular nonfiction. The application to the meaning of life and its direction is something more pusillanimous academics would never attempt, so the new thing to me is actually writing out the interesting and straightforward implications of various well-accepted findings (anyone who thinks this is all based on speculative ideas is a dilettante). More to the point of population contention, the thinking that life in general isn't mere happenstance, is good cocktail chatter."
4,A Must Read for Anthropology Buffs and Futurist Geeks Alike,"A compelling assertion of the inevitability of the emergence of more and more complex connections between humans in society and even genes which, as the other reviewers mention, covers human history in a brush strokes similar to those of Jared Diamond's Gun's, Germs and Steel, focusing on the large trends of the last five thousand years.Yes, dense; yes, ambitious. But the importance of nonzero sumness has never been so eloquently and ingeniously demonstrated.One star is removed for the loose and muddled chapters that bookend the rest of the work. They contain valid points, but sloppy writing."
3,"Non Zero 1, Author 0","While the over all theme of the book is almost unassailable, the author lends himself to criticism on almost every page. For example, ""There is today a lot more pig DNA around than its undomesticated kin, wild boar DNA. In that sense--in the Darwinian Sense--getting eaten is the best thing that ever happened to pork."" It almost seems the author does more to invalidate his position than to justify it."
1,"Nonzero, nonplussed: what logic?","This book combines scientific facts with the author's (political?) opinions in a very questionable, naive way. What he calls 'fact' would not be endorsed by a real scientist worth his salt, EVER. Much of evolutionary psychology is in fact story-telling, as most biologists in their right mind recognise. But it is a good book in that it serves as a warning light, maybe, to what havoc our present behavior might wreak on the world."
2,forgets the most important nonzero sums,This book completely ignores the most important nonzero sums of a human male's life which are the amount of women a male mates with and the amount of children a male sires. Ignoring these two sums makes the theory Wright proposes collapse.
4,"Timberline Vestibule: Good storage, bad airflow","This add on is a must have for people who will be using this tent in a nasty weather environment. (Rain or snow) While there are few directions included with this item, you can pretty much figure it out by looking at the illustration included. This vestibule adds almost a third more area to your already spacious timberline. Anyone who has done any hiking knows that you don't want your nasty gear in the living area with you all night! There is no floor to the vestibule, but the sides do underlap, and provide good flooding protection. I really must say that I don't use mine as much as I thought I would due to the fact that it REALLY cuts down on airflow into and out of the tent. It just seems that unless your really take care to orient your tent to a constant wind, that it will get very stuffy very quickly. I highly recommend the rain fly that is also sold for this tent provides rain protection, but not wind or downpour."
5,Eureka Vestibule,"Great add-on. Easy to attach and works as it is designed. Great for storing your shoes and other items outside the tent. The first time in use, it rained. Everything was dry the next morning."
5,Amazing Model,This model is probably one of the more beautiful from Breyer. Very nice bright gold bay with a shine. Stands well and can wear all english tack and most western (some western saddles are too bulky). Paint seems more durable than on most models (hasn't come off of the tips of his ears yet).
4,SWAT DVD review,"I received the SWAT DVD for Christmas and I was thrilled. I remember watching SWAT when I was younger, and the thing that stands out the most was the five guys, and the theme song. As I watched the DVDs, I honestly don't remember any of the episodes, but it really amazes me how much ""ahead"" the show really was - the storylines about the terrorists, snipers, etc...I really enjoyed watching the DVDs, and am really hoping that a SWAT, Second Season will be out soon!Love all the characters, and really would like to know what James Coleman is doing nowadays. We already know what the other four are/were doing, but we don't really hear about James Coleman anymore."
5,SWAT First Season,Great acting and directing. I can't wait to get rest of seasons. I watch it 2-3 times a week. This was my favorite cop show in college.
5,Great,"Really enjoyed SWAT a a kid, made more my old friend of the family Mark Shapiro aka Mark Shera. And by the way - my 15 year old daughter thinks you're hot Mark."
3,Good 1970s cop show,SWAT is a good 1970s cop show. The theme song is great. I think Steve Forrest is a great actor. I absolutely loved this show as a kid. I have no complaint about this set. I just haven't enjoyed the shows as much as I have other series such as Rockford and Hawaii Five-0.
5,"S.W.A.T. The Complete First Season, DVD","This set brings back the memories of when it was originally on. The quality is great, they have cleaned it up and made it quality product. If you love the COP shows of the 70's this set is for you."
4,Still Waiting for Season Two,It's been nearly two years since the release of Season One. It's borderline criminal not to release the final series after so long a time.
4,S.W.A.T.,I haven't had the chance to watch it yet. As soon as I know I'll let you know. Check back later.
4,a trip down memory lane,"I'm a sucker for all 80's cop shows. This was one of my favorites. So glad to see that I could still enjoy it on DVD. Pretty much as I remembered it. Not gripping drama, but entertaining none the less. This was a great addition to my collection of good ole' cops & robber kind of stuff."
2,Different Brand Shipped,"For $12, I'm not going to deal with a return, but the subwoofer cable I received was not the Belkin Pure AV cable that was shown."
1,D.O.A.,"Cable didn't work right out of the box...I spent good money on the rest of my gear and cables, so I guess I shouldn't cheap out on the subwoofer cable:( Going with a higher quality one next time!"
5,"You may also need a ""Y"" adapter","I ordered the Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black) to go with my Yamaha CRX-330BL Micro Component Receiver CD Player Unit and bought Belkin PureAV AV20500-15 15-Foot Subwoofer Audio Cable to connect them. It turns out you also need a Monster ILJRY-1 F Single Female RCA to Dual Male RCA Y-Adapter to feed the signal into both channels of the subwoofer, or it doesn't work right. Once I got all the components, it's fine, but it took a week and two orders to figure it all out."
2,Humming Cable,"This may be a case of unfortunate defective product. I've purchased and used many Belkin products and when a Belkin product is good (most all Belkin products are), I am very pleased with quality and performance for the price. I did not exchange this cable since I used another from a local source.Whatever the case, I won't say I hate this cable but, because of the humming, I don't like it for it didn't work out for me."
5,Amazing,"No flaws, plugs in very tight, no signal loss, long, gold connectors, it even feels really nice in your hands"
5,good cable,"Belkin makes great accesories, you have to buy monster cable, 100 to 300 cables to have great sound, SOMETIMES you can go cheap and if you do get mid grade not all the way cheap...great job BELKIn..."
4,You can't beat Belkin,Belkin knows how to make a quality product don't waste your money on marketing and hype.
4,Good Cable,"AS far as I can tell this is a solid cable. I don't really see anything specific to being only attached to a sub-woofer, more than this is just a single cable that has some pretty good shielding on it. The sound quality is improved over that mm thick freebie cable that comes in the box, but that's to be expected. This cable is pretty inexpensive and I'm sure it works just as well as a ""$100"" premium cable."
3,can't stop the hmmmmmmmmm,"I bought a belkin sub cable before but it was the y version, and it solved my humming problem, this one didn't."
1,Noticeable Hummmmmmm,"I read the reviews of this cord. One person said there was a noticeable hum. He said that he had to switch it out with a much cheaper and simpler av cord. I ignored it. BIG MISTAKE. The connection was NOT snug and when there was no sound coming out, there was a pronounced HUM. Turning down the volume eliminated it, but it also eliminated the subwoofer. DO NOT BUY THIS. Belkin AV20500-15 is a waste of money. I chased the price, and that was a mistake."
5,"Works Well, nice and thick","This cable works. Not sure what else to say, it is thick, and feels quality, not a huge sub cable expert, but it does the job!"
5,"Feels solid, good length","This subwoofer cable feels solid; my first impression was that I purchased a good quality cable. The cable is longer than what I need for my setup, but it's a good length to keep the subwoofer at a distance from the other equipment. For $10 you can't beat it!"
1,This deserves a ZERO.,"""Pamela"" should not be making a penny from this piece of junk. If you enjoy reading stories where the man's organs are so big that the skin comes off of them during intercourse and the woman smells like gum, then this is the book for you. This book has never been proofed and it is the horribleness of it which makes you try to read it so you can laugh. She also uses real people without their permission. Kelly Clarkson in particular is made to look like a drug-using idiot."
2,The best thing in this book is the mention of Constantine Maroulis in the dedication,"Yes, I confess that the only reason I purchased this book was because Constantine Maroulis was mentioned in the dedication. I'm about half way through the book now, but I don't really want to finish it. The grammatical errors are plentiful! I can not believe that a book with this many mistakes could be published. I think that the premise of the story is cute; Johnie being in love with two men who are in fact, both the same man. I get the point of the story, however, it is just going on and on and becoming monotonous. El/Spike is NOT Constantine Maroulis or anything like him for that matter... except, oh yeah... he has long hair and sings. I truly do not recommend that anybody waste their valuable time reading this comedy of errors. By the way... Constantine Maroulis Rocks!** I am editing to add... thank goodness I am done reading this book. I couldn't wait for it to be over. This woman seriously needs an editor."
2,Totally NAKED!,"This album ROCKS!!!!! This album has been VERY welcomed by Jettheads EVERYWHERE. I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS CD! My favorite..... ""Right In The Middle"", a true Jett melody. And the raunchy ""Kiss On The Lips""..... SWEET! I also enjoy ""Can't Live Without You"", and ""Season Of The Witch""..... good remake.Joan Jett is truly 'Naked' here."
4,Potential 5 star American release!,"The name of the American release of Naked is Sinner & finally dropped on June 13th...Jettheads will love JJ&BHs; first full fledged CD since Pure & Simple. I gave it 4 stars in it's present form but I can see giving 5 with a few minor improvements. I personally would reduce the running time down to about 50 minutes, keep tracks 1 to 9 intact, keep 2 or 3 songs from the remainder of Naked & sonically upgrade the entire USA release.Naked is full of typical Joan Jett riffs. Look out for Right In the Middle (retitled Riddles on the Sinner CD) to connect with the VH1 crowd. Other top track are the title track & Bad Time."
2,10 years for this????,"I don't think Joan Jett has alot to say anymore. Alot of these songs are leftovers from an unreleased Warner Brothers cd from the late 90's. There are a few good songs, but overall, nothing is great.Joan's manager, Kenny laguna, always raves about how he and Joan own their own record company, and how they sold her first solo album out of the back of their cars etc...I'm just curious then why it took 10 years to follow up her 1994 PURE AND SIMPLE album?Anyway-some good songs, some bad songs. I hear they are selling this at the Joan Jett concerts now ALOT cheaper-just don't make them mad-they won't sell anything to you ever again!"
4,She evolves while staying the same,"After reading the other reviews I was not expecting too much. I bought it anyway since I have everything else since pre-Runaways. I must tell you I got really surprised. I love it. OK, she's not yelling and speeding like before but it's a damn good album. Buy it!"
3,"Looking for the definitive 5th, this is not it.","As an avid classical collector (over 600 CDs), I purchased this to add to my extensive catalog of Tchaikowsky's 5th. The piece starts out sterling, the Vienna Philharmonic and Karajan draw you into the music and captivate your mind's eye with images of thousands of violins being furiously played. The original image bit processing sound is extraordinary!! Better than the 4D of DG. However towards the end of the 2d movement the pace picks up. The music becomes hurried and rushed. The execution is there but there is no time to dwell on the splendor of this piece. It feels rushed. This speed continues through both the 3d and 4th movements. At the end you feel somewhat let down. I expected more from this disc. The Solti version with Chicago recorded in 1989 is much better and would be the disc I would recommend if you only want one recording of this piece. However, the crispness and clarity of the recording makes this one for a collector."
4,Prelude to Glory by Ron Carer,I enjoy reading the book and the fact that it's story about the revolutionary war and mostly true history. We can also enlarge the print size to meet our needs
5,Read this book!!,"This is a terrific book for parents, grandparents, teachers or anyone wanting insight on this misunderstood illness. Whether you are starting the search for information or you have been in the midst of the ""Mood Storm"" for years this book is worth reading!! Dr. Greenberg validates, in an easy to read way, what it's like to live with Bipolar Disorder."
4,Very usedul information,"Very useful information. Is not the ""bible"" on pediatric bipolar but gives you another point of view and since we are still learning about this horrible condition the more we know the better."
4,Elegant yet revealing,"Karajan's last recording is one of his best latter-day discs. Recorded with the Vienna Philharmonic after his celebrated bustup with the BPO, it's an elegant yet often revealing reading of a work he considered one of his favourites. While Karajan could sometimes descend into mere slickness (particularly in his last decade), that's not the case here, and there's an air of intensity, particularly in the last two movements. The VPO plays with all their usual well-oiled precision. If you want intense spiritual struggle in your Bruckner symphonies, stick to Gunter Wand or Furtwangler; but if you want a spacious, highly intelligent yet unneurotic reading, try this."
4,A Double Requiem,"On the subject of Bruckner's 7th Symphony, composed after Bruckner perceived the impending death of his hero Richard Wagner and indeed appropriating the very Wagner tubas into the score in the Adagio which was apparently directly inspired by Bruckner's encounter with Wagner, it would be a disservice to the recorded versions of this work not to include this CD which proved to be Herbert von Karajan's valedictory recording.Though the actual performance with the Vienna Philharmonic is not fully uplifting or illuminating, it does suggest the obeisance many of the great conductors of the romantic repertoire had for Bruckner. There is a communication with the spirit of Bruckner that haunts this recording, and to make the complete circle of dealing with Brucker's mighty 7th, this recording deserves a careful hearing. Grady Harp, February 2005"
1,Great orchestra,"Not so great a conductor. This 7th is for the casual Brucknerian at best. It's a good easy ""ReadersDigest"" version of a sublime work. If you need true inspiration and are willing and able to ""understand"" Bruckner - try the EMI/Celibidache/Munich or the DG/Furtwangler/Berlin Phil. True wizards of the very highest order."
1,Sterile,"Once more, the great imposter beguiles. Hiding behind the wonderful playing of the VPO, Karajan amply demonstrates how un-necessary he really is."
4,Good action novel with original story line.,"Book 2 of Gammalaw ended with disaster at the meeting of Dextra Haven and Grandee Rhodes. Book Three starts with the main characters going off in a variety of directions. Good action along with some really unique local characters and customs. The plot becomes quite complex and some really unexpected twists and turns develop in the story line. I have yet to figure out how it all is going to come together, which makes it more entertaining. Really looking forward to Book 4, which I understand has been written, but not released."
3,Gets very hot!,"I love the quality of this light but when it's been on for only a few minutes, it get's very hot. You cannot touch the shade at this point. Also, the heat that radiates down from the light is hot. We are very careful when it is on making sure the bulb does not come in contact with the sofa or pillows. It would definately cause a fire."
2,"Not durable, not very huggable","My son (22 mos) is totally enamoured with Curious George. I purchased this toy and he did, in fact, really like it. However, I don't really like the material used to make this toy. It isn't really that soft and he isn't as squishy as you might want him to be. The construction is also pretty shoddy. He was sporting numerous holes after only about a month. I would suggest buying a doll put out by a different company instead. Don't buy this one."
1,Not Good,When we recieved this Curious George it did not look anything like it did online. My son does not like him at all. He is not soft and looks a little scary. I wish we had not purchased him.
1,Bit small for price,"My problem with this item was not the peron i bought it from, just the size of the plush for the price paid. My wife had always said she wanted a meatwad plush and i had tried for 3 months to get one. I would not again pay this pricew for the item."
5,Demystifying math...,"Professor Stein's book is an amazing read. It's humorous, insightful, and educational. A couple of those ""great mysteries"" from our math classes in school are solved and you will slap your forehead and say,""Well, they could have taught me THAT years ago!""I highly recommend this book to all levels of math students AND math teachers."
4,As Someone Who Has to Encourage Math. to Youngsters,"I can use the book to indirectly persuade youngsters, who think Math. is nothing but number and boring, to take it more seriously. It's hard for me to come up with more logical and more convincing than what already there in the book."
2,"Sounds nice, but this is not the original tempo","Karajan seems to ""romanticize"" this Requiem created by the god-like W.A. Mozart. Sure it sounds darker than any other rendition, but the maestro slows the whole work down (except for the Dies Irae; in this recording, it's faster than usual), which makes it duller and less conventional. The soloists and the choir do fine, but I agree with {vaughna} that the singers ""add drama in too many places where it isn't called for.""I would strongly suggest other recordings, like conductor Philippe Herreweghe conducting the Orchestre des Champs-Elysees (Label: Harmonia Mundi), or Jos van Veldhoven and the Netherlands Bach Society (Label: Channel Classics). Karajan's Requiem may be different and wickedly emotional, but there are more exquisite (and underrated) recordings out there that need to be more appreciated than this one."
1,Mozart merece melhor,"Esta é sem dúvida uma das piores interpretaes do Requiem de Mozart executada por um dos grandes maestro do nosso tempo.A escolha do tempo é demasiado lenta, o colorido orquestral no passa de uma massa homogénia aonde nada é claro e tudo demasiado incipiente. O pior é sem dúvida o Tuba Mirium no qual o baixo Paata Burchuladze tem uma entrada desastrosa. Na verdade, esta como muitas das últimas interprtaes de Karajan so das piores da sua carreira. Para os fs deste maestro aconselho a verso do requiem da série Galeria (DG) gravado nos anos 60.B.C."
5,"Mozart: Requiem / Tomowa-Sintow, Müller Molinari, Cole, Burchuladze; von Karajan","Mozart: Requiem / Tomowa-Sintow, Müller Molinari, Cole, Burchuladze; von Karajan~ Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a splendid recording with the talented and brilliant Herbert Von Karajan. The pacing is right on the mark and this probably one of the best recordings that I have ever heard of this particular piece in question. As when it comes to any Deutsche Grammophon recording the sound is astounding and the vocal skills of the singers is without a doubt high-class. The book-let is great with well-written liner notes and an interesting short essay written Alex Hyatt King. The book-let also has some very nice photos. von Karajan is so passionate and intense and one can verily feel his passion for the music as one listens to this truly stupendous recording. Highly recommended indeed. 5 stars without a doubt!"
4,Imagination and Reality,"I found this book to be full of imaginative stories that still held enough reality to be very believable. The characters are well developed, and I had a sense of being on the mountain with them. Bravo, Sis!"
1,Wasted Talent,"Chris Botti is a fabulous trumpeter, but this CD is his worst. Sounds like he rushed through a bad rehearsal and recorded whatever came out...rush job for the holidays. Very disappointing! He should be more selective with arrangements that match his talent instead of dragging him down. He has one of the smoothest sounds around, and can do so much more. A lot of fans will buy anything he records because he is friendly and attractive. I buy only if the music is good. Looking forward to better things from him...I have faith! Thanks"
4,Stretch & Bend,"Chris Botti's ""December"" is easy to underestimate, but it is an excellent holiday collection. On ""Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,"" his trumpet takes inventive jazz license that stretches & bends this timeless Sammy Cahn classic. Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" is not a song that will make many Christmas playlists with Cohen's wry lyric, but when played by as an instrumental by Botti it has a graceful build that highlights its joyful sense. ""Santa Claus Is Coming Town"" & Santa can samba! ""Winter Wonderland"" is one of those delightful tracks where David Carpenter's bass & Botti's wild trumpet give a new & delightful take on this familiar classic. ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"" may be my favorite track with just guitar & trumpet giving a wistful flavor to this gorgeous melody. ""December"" is an excellent disc for the holidays, one that will wear well for many years. Enjoy!"
2,Botti's weakest effort,"As a big fan of Chris Botti and of Christmas music, I was quite disappointed in this album. There is a certain lack of cohesiveness, and the vocals are, well, to put it nicely, not very good.Interpretations of standards are never easy, particularly when translating from voice to instrument; but more often than not-it just doesn't work here. Some of Botti's more recent efforts have astounded me with gentle intricacy and positive energy. This album sounds like a demo that hasn't had the kinks worked out yet.Aside from the issue with the vocals, there are misplaced sounds and synths that are out of time. Beats are missed and a few gaping gaffes in production.I really debated between two and three stars, but in the end I went with two because Botti fans will buy it regardless, but newbies may buy it and be left with a disappointed impression of him. This is really recomended only for fans. I hope he does another album of holiday music and finishes it next time."
5,Great Holiday music,This album is extremely beautiful. It has a lot of charm and this Holiday sweet spirit that everyone loves. It's so good that I keep listening to it even after the season...
4,A Jazzy Christmas Album,"Finally a Christmas album that doesn't make me sick with the syrupy sweet, tired lyrics. I've heard it said that as entertainers achieve fame, they are compelled to do a Christmas album. Please make them stop! Chris Botti has a winner here and is a nice, jazzy take on the standards that is best enjoyed with a nice glass of Shiraz."
4,"Soothing, moving, delightful!","I am not the trumpet enthusiast my husband is, so when I requested this CD to please his palate, I was dubious about how much I would enjoy adding it to the holiday CD rotation. It is fabulous! It feels both fresh and familiar at the same time, soothing, yet festive. Particularly impressive is the beautiful arrangement of Ave Maria. A wonderful, (for the most part) instrumental holiday collection I would recommend to all - no jazz experience required!"
5,December,"Relax and enjoy Chris Botti while you're writing holiday cards, wrapping packages or bustling through your hectic Christmas to-do list. We'll have this CD playing on our Christmas travels this year. Hope you do too."
4,Chris,"You can never go wrong wtih a Chris Botti CD whatever the season. He is so AWESOME!Great talent and great sounds and I enjoyed it totally. He also sings and that was nice to hear. Did not know he could sing, so that's a double treat...LOVE IT!"
3,"Spidey, but lacking","Spider-man has been a great comic franschise for 50 years or more but this novel demotes it. The novel is a very quick read, and you be wishing for more.To give a small synopsis on the book: Spider-man is yet again caught in trouble between a cat burglary by Black Cat,the kingpin's return and the mystery of a stone tablet. The story becomes an adaptation to the original spider-man story which mixes up elements in blender to spit in marvel's face. The story uses elements of the girl-next-door love interest, and a simplistic mystery story, that lacks deadly secrets for reader to be left surprised and hesitate to turn the page; It's just lacking story and length. But the drawings of Mark Bagley provide a good drama. If you buy the book for Mark Bagely's drawings great, but if your buying this for the world's greatest story, you can pass this up."
4,Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 8: Cats & Kings,"This eighth TPB collects another complete story arc and features Spidey meeting up with the Ultimate version of the Black Cat as well as Elektra. While I didn't really care for the look of the Black Cat's costume and felt this storyline wasn't quite as good as most of the previous ones, I still thought it was good enough for four stars and would consider it a solid storyline and a recommended read. There are several interesting things that take place in the pages, including the frustration of Peter as he learns of the Kingpin's ""unfair"" release from custody, the Black Cat's flirtation with Peter (whose mind is already reeling from emotions stirred up by Mary Jane, and Peter's continuing problems at high school. The book ends with an uncertain fatality, but I won't spoil it for you by giving it away. Go ahead and pick it up for yourself to find out the whole story."
5,Wish I had this earlier!,"With a lively and entertaining style, the author covers how to stay safe on Ebay. Both buyers and sellers will benefit from her explanations of how things work on Ebay. Real life examples are used to illustrate what can go wrong, how to avoid problems and how to escape problems.Even thought I've been on Ebay since 1998, I found myself exclaiming over and over again, ""So, that's how it works!"" While it is not written directly for beginners, it would certainly be helpful to have before you have a conflict. I certainly wish that I had it before I was hit with negative feedback...undeserved, of course. I would recommend it for people who are currently involved with buying or selling on Ebay and those who are interested in getting involved."
