1,WHERE'S THE CUE?,ORDERED THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT & GOT THE BOX AND THE STUFFING IN THE BOX BUT NO CUES.Thank-fully Amazon issued a full refund.I have been pleased with most of this line in the past though they are not for any serious long term play.They can be shortened for tight spots and there is no loud or uncomfortable reverberation.These use glue on tips so if you want to jazz up the practice cues you can simply replace with new and better cue tips.The weight is simple to control as the weight of the cue is controlled by 4 external rings the removal of which decreases the weight of the cue.You remove the center part to shorten the stick.One strange element of these cues is that they have the male part for cue attachment in the shaft rather the in the butt of the cue.I had to buy these at a nearby sports store for much more than they were being sold on Amazon but be forwarned about the careless shipping practices of the seller.
4,The Bens need to get together more often,"This CD was on sale after the Bens show I went to in Melbourne and of course I couldn't be bothered lining up for it. Totally regretted it and have been thinking about it ever since. Thank goodness for the internet.This is what happens when 3 individually kick-arse artists come together to form a 3 headed mutant awesome music machine. Four beautiful tracks, but have to say, I can't go past Just Pretend."
3,Construction paper bright green,"Very nice color, good quality cnstruction paper. I am giving it three stars, because I was misled by the posting and the image that I was buying 12x18 size paper."
1,Inpatient Obstetric Nursing,"I would not recommend this review book because of the numerous errors that are in the book. 1. The set up of the questions is not at all representative of the questions that are on the NCC exam. The test does not have ""all of the above"" or ""none of the above"" nor does it contain 4 choices for each question. 2. The worst part of the book was the last section on Obstetrical Nursing Care. It is outdated information and would be misleading to the candidate taking the exam. Of major concern is the section on the newborn where it states that the baby should be NPO for 12 hours - and the preterm for 24 hours! 3. There are no references. I am very disappointed with this book and will not use it and not recommend this to others. I don't know who the ""National Learning Corporation"" is, but I would recommend to them to remove this book from their name."
1,Can't believe someone published this,"I have several issues with this book:1. Poor grammar including the use of many double negatives. Book definitely needs an editor.2. Multiple spelling mistakes3. Out-dated information4. Some of the answers are just plain WRONG!5. No rationale is given...only the correct answer is supplied.My biggest complaint is number 4. If SOME of the answers are wrong (whether due to typo or wrong info), how am I to know that all the other questions are right? I would NOT recommend this book."
3,Not helpful for certificaton examination review,"This book is good in general, but do not be confused by the title. It will not help you review for the certification exam for Inpatient Obstetrics. It is a helpful tool to evaluate weak spots and strengthen areas, but do not expect your exam to anywhere resemble the reviews or practice tests in this book. I was told that there really wasn't any book to review for the RNC exam because the exam is based on information you should already know. That was correct. I bought and read this book and a couple of others and nothing that I read was any help for the exam. I did pass my exam, but it was a humdinger. Don't buy this book thinking it will help you pass your exam."
4,Inpatient Obstetric Nursing,Great for studying for cert. exam. However I found several questions and answers that were inaccurate. On the whole a good study guide.
2,Inpatient Obstetric Nursing,"Gave some interesting and informative questions and answers, but not what I expected. Would be ok to refresh on questions only."
4,We really like them,The set looks really nice. The packaging and shipping were perfect. Everything was wrapped up securely and there were no problems with the dishes. My only complaint is that the dishes have black marks / scratches from the silverware. But I don't think there is anything that can be done to prevent that.
2,they get scratch marks,when this arrived I was very pleased with its quality-color-packaging -everything.Only problems is that after a short time using the plates I noticed scratch marks-dark ones in the center of the plates-I would guess from where people used their dinner knives to cut their food--very disappointing-as I was ready to buy the entire collection-glad i waited..
2,Pretty Pattern but quality is below average,"Ordered 2 sets because I trust the Pfaltzgraff name and thought the pattern was pretty. Quality is below average. Not one of the bowls in the 2 sets was perfectly round, so they dont stack well. Flatware seems to leave marks on the plates and I recently discovered a flaw on the mugs. There is a hairline crack next to the handle on 2 of the mugs. The finish (green) in the bowls and mugs is also a problem."
5,Excellant CD!,This is by far one of the greatest works of Toad the Wet Sprocket. Definately get this one if you are a fan!
5,Still Love Toad,"I don't usually bother with writing reviews, but I feel I owe to the band, as well as to a great many potential listeners who may not be familiar with the group. This was my first Toad album (11 years or so ago), and I've been an avid listener ever since. I enjoy the emotion they can put into the simplest of stories. Makes me feel like I was right there with them. Every song on this album is a journey.My personal favorite is the ""Nightingale Song"". Very short, very simple, VERY uplifting. On my worst day, this song always puts the world back into perspective for me. Makes me smile, and what more can one ask for than that?"
4,Toad stills rocks but not as much,"I was a little disapointed with this release, it didn't quite measure up to some other their other albums,Coil and Dulcinea. While the work had all the emotion and the hit single ""All I want"", it seemed angry. The lyrics cold and distant. But, dispite this it still a good album and worth buying. There a number of catchy tunes that I found myself huming around the house."
3,Excellent,"This is one of those very, very rare CDs where every single track is very good. I can sit and listen to this album over and over again..years after its release. There is not one bad track here.There is one, slightly unpleasant track however. ""Hold Her Down"" depicts a graphic rape. This track may not be to everybody's liking. The music is pleasant, the lyrics are most definitely not.This is a CD for those of us who remember the hayday of alternative music with fondness. If you enjoy vintage REM and early 90s Depeche Mode, this CD will likely appeal to you."
5,great,"i love Toad, and this is one of their best albums. recommend for anyone who is trying to get into this band as a first album!"
4,Great under rated band.,"Toad The Wet Sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties. They wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable. BUT, there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste. My fave song is 'Is It For Me'. It is hard to classify them though. It sort of deep and meaningful (at most times) pop rock. Other good tracks include Walk On The Ocean, Pray Your Gods and I Will Not Take...etc. I regard this album and 'Dulcinea' as their two best albums."
4,"You may ask yourself, ""Is It For Me""?","""Fear"" is Toad The Wet Sprocket at their commercial peak. I personally like the first two albums more, but this is definitely a great album, and their most popular. Their two biggest hits are from this disc, those being ""Walk On The Ocean"" and ""All I Want"". However ""Hold Her Down"" and ""I Will Not Take These Things For Granted"" were also minor hits, and the rest of the album has its share of gems. There's also the retrospective ""P.S."" which has the hits on it, and an excellent live disc ""Welcome Home"" covering the first three Toad releases. All are recommended, as well as Glen Phillips last solo disc."
5,One of the finest albums since REM.,"Toad the wet sprocket's ""Fear"" is one of the finest CDs I have ever listened to. Catchy and melodious tunes such as ""Walk On The Ocean"" and ""I Will Not Take These Things For Granted"" is focused on Nature, and their smash hit ""All I Want"" is focused on being you. Their style and creativity in music has originality and the way they deliver it to the people was remarkable. One review in 1992 was right...Toad The Wet Sprocket could be a great threat to REM's throne."
4,Exceptional,"I have to admit that I was not crazy about this one at first, but I am now coming around. Not too long ago, I would have given this a three, but it's such a sincere sounding work, that I am more than willing to give it that extra star. Bravo."
5,Angels & Heroes,I loved the series and I was grateful when I happened to find this video while shopping with my daughter (actually she spotted it first). We used to watch the series together. I've watched the video several times with her and I've passed it along to friends. The first episode deals with issues of racism with sensitivity and realism; the second with finding faith in one's own special way. I really feel uplifted whenever I watch the episodes which are aired as reruns. I am pleased that Amazon.com has other episodes available. Thanks.
5,"""Duck Rockers""","This is definitely a comming of age movie about the Samoan culture. It pokes fun at alot of the common Samoan stereotypes, without being overly offensive. I found myself watching it over and over. I'm looking forward to more projects comming out from here in the US, and overseas. I think this really sets the bar."
1,"Tries hard, falls flat.","I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this review, as this film just isn't worth the effort. Sufficed to say, I only laughed twice during the entire movie - and they weren't big laughs, they were barely audible. One of the least funny comedies I've ever seen."
2,FYI- would have been rated R,"It wasn't what I was hoping for. There were some funny scenes, and it was an interesting slice of life in another culture, however, it was a slice that I found unpalatable. Too much boozing, lack of consideration in intimacy. I would be glad to have most of the characters NOT my neighbors. I purchased the DVD because I like the Laughing Samoans, I have been to a number of Samoan festivities, and I was looking for something light and humorous. I was going to give it to the Pacific Islander Support group on campus, but decided the negative far outweighed the laughs."
4,Will the wedding party be a party or a wedding?,"Sione is getting married. He has decided that he does not want his brother Michael, and his three party-boys mates, to attend.They have nearly ruined every wedding they have attended. But they are given a chance to attend - they must bring real girl-friends,not party-girls, to the wedding and they have one month to pull it together. This comedy set in Auckland about first generation SamoanNew Zealanders, starts a bit slow, but by the time of the wedding, it gains speed and really becomes the urban romantic comedy it ismeant to be. If you are not Samoan, nor familiar with Samoan New Zealanders, you might not appreciate the inside humour, butthe writing and acting is good enough to make this light-hearted romp a winner for most. Recommended."
4,Reminds Me,"Samoan Wedding for this North American female created an interesting contrast to Once Were Warriors. Both movies provided a much-needed slice-of-life look at New Zealand culture as lived by those descended from natives of the island. Like Rabbit-Proof Fence does for Australia, these two movies alert the rest of the world that there's more Down Under than Guy Pierce, Nicole Kidman, and Russel Crowe.Once Were Warriors is a heavy-hitting drama whereas Samoan Wedding is romantic comedy.Important to the film is a careful mixture of personalities, family dynamics, and maturity levels to guard against stereotype.Surprising is the close similarities between Samoan culture and African American culture. Those who've seen and enjoyed The Brothers (2001), The Best Man (1999), and The Wood (1999) will enjoy Samoan Wedding."
5,"Very, very helpful book","This book was instrumental in helping us manage our toddler's biting problem. We learned that his daycare was using ineffective strategies to try and solve the problem. For example, the book describes that timeouts are typically not effective for toddlers.Our solution was to switch to a new daycare whose philosophies meshed with those described in this book. The daycare believed that the biting was purely the problem of the daycare to manage, there wasn't anything wrong with the toddler or the parents, and the toddler would grow out of it. Since our child started at the new daycare, his biting has dropped to almost nothing.I must have read thirty different web sites before I read this book, and this book had more information than any of them. If you are having problems with a biting toddler, I recommend this book.The book is easy to read and gives lots of examples. In spite of the title, this is NOT a dry, humorless ""policy and procedure"" manual."
4,Great Conflict Resolution,"It was so good to see a couple with such commitment to communication. Watched it on a stormy evening, perfect for a thrill."
4,Going strong,"Maybe not as good as the earlier books, it fells like some ideas are re-used and the story stands still for a while, but if you like Zits, its a safe buy. New material through the whole book."
1,Sterling Tek batteries,"I bought several of these batteries thinking I got at good deal, but they did not last more than six months. After that, they retained very little charge. Could not use them."
1,poor design,These are pretty useless because of the locking clasp. It falls down when you are using the tongs so they are always getting stuck in the locked position just when you are trying to pick something up.
5,"Fast shipping, great product!","We love this tool box, my husband has been thrilled with his Father's Day gift and has already completed several ""projects"" now that his tools are all organized in one place."
5,User Friendly,This book is simple and profound. If all of us followed this simple prescription we would signifcantly reduce our dependency on the medical system.
3,"Somewhat simplistic, good basic review","This book is smaller than expected, but still it has a lot of good common sense information in it. There is no new magical information in it."
1,Impossible to Program,"I properly set up and mounted the darn unit. All I want to know is how fast I am going, but the darn thing is stuck on kmh with no way to get to mph. The booklet is larger than the Affordable Healthcare Act and is about as easy to understand. Lord help me."
3,"Great set-up, lousy computer, good VDO warranty service","Update: I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because VDO replaced the unit with a newer version which works fine. They are apparently aware of the signal/communication problems and replaced the problematic unit under their 2-yr warranty by simply checking the serial number. They sent the replacement within 1 week (from Germany).Original review:Set-up was great. Good hardware. I had high hopes...and then started riding with it. Completely unreliable! The signal gets lost so often, the computer is practically useless, even with new batteries. The only time it consistently gets a signal is when you ride with hands on the tops right next to the computer. Pretty disappointing to come home from a 3-hr ride and have the computer tell you that you rode a walloping, cramp-inducing 23 miles!? Am I that old??? Lame wireless sender/receiver that loses signal constantly. Stay away from this computer and get something that works properly."
5,The Canon is Blazing,"Recently, I heard the amazing recording of Paganini's D Major Concerto by Massimo Quartra. Not only is the perfomance outstanding on all counts, this recording provides a rare opportunity to heard Paganini's own violin, nicknamed ""the Canon"" because of its powerfully intense tone. But not only is there power, there is a surprising sweetness about this instrument, in the very capable hands of Quartra, that immediately impresses the hearer. This disk provides a glimpse of what Paganini's own playing must have been like. Procure it!"
5,Positive information,"We are so thrilled with this workbook. The information is introduced in a positive, non-judgemental way. Asperger's Syndrome is an Autism Spectrum Disorder and I see no issue in using the term autism when referring to a person on the autism spectrum/Asperger's. Fantastic book!"
3,"All references are to ""autism""","I was disappointed to find that throughout the book, the term ""autism"" was used, rather than Asperger's. There is some debate as to whether Asperger's is a form of autism. Moreover, I don't use the term ""autistic"" with my very high-functioning Asperger's child. It may not be fair, but ""autistic"" has the connotation of someone with a much more severe disability.Other than that, the book seems great. But I may never use it for the reason above."
4,Autism Book,"I am so overwhelmed right now, I started to look at the book and then lost track of doing it."
5,Asperger's: What Does It Mean to Me?,To any parent or care giver for a child with Autism/ Aspergers this is an excellent way to gain insight into what your child is coping with and what you need to do to understand and help them. We first saw a copy of this a year ago and since then I have bought one for ourselves to use and one for the teaching assistant that works with our autistic child.
5,Help students understand themselves!,This is a tool I can't wait to use. This will help my students understand themselves. It will also help me understand and advocate for my students!
4,Great teaching tool,"The most important thing for children with Asperger's is to work through lots of teaching moments. My son has a behavioral therapist part time but every day, all day has teaching moments. This book is a great guide to help with almost anything that either has or will need to be one of those moments. This is a great tool for us parents to help us use the right words and examples to be effective as part of our children's ongoing therapy."
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" for educators and parents of autistic children","I have worked with autistsic children for the past 15 years. Catherine Faherty's workbook provides practical ideas for explaining self-awareness and life lessons for children and young adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. It is an excellent resource for teachers and paraprofessionals who work with autistic children in the inclusion model. Examples are clear and worksheets are well organized. This book can also help family and friends understand how autism affects a child's personal development, behavior, relationships, and overall view of the world."
5,9 year old Aspie Girl,"I normally don't write reviews, but I had to say that this book is excellent for explaining to a high functioning child what it means to have Asperger's syndrome. I have a 9 year old girl with Asperger's who was diagnosed as High Functioning Autistic at age 3 and Asperger's at age 6. We decided to wait until she was 9 to share her diagnosis with her. We used this workbook to explain to her about Asperger's and she loves completing the worksheets and really seems to understand it very well. She was so excited about the book that she took it to school and showed her teacher who also thought it is a great work book and the school is considering purchasing copies for other students. I would highly recommend this workbook for any child with Asperger's and for parents to share it with their child. I think it would be most appropriate for children ages 8-13, but could be used for older children as a form of self exploration."
5,Asperger's: What Does It Mean to Me?,It helps the reader to understand asperger's/autism. A workbook for the student to help understand his/her behaviors and suggestions for the teacher/parent on how to work with the student in all areas of life. A must for anyone who deals with students who have asperger's/autism.
5,Excellent!,"This book is great. It is written very nicely and in first person, so it makes you feel like it is actually... you. It is a great way for introducing the topic to young people, with or without autism. It can be shared with people who know somebody with autism, a family member of somebody with autism, or even the person themselves. Great book!"
5,works great for keeping baby warm,"This works great for warming the lotion for a baby after a bath, and is easy to use. The lotion is warm, but not hot. You will need to fill the dispenser from your normal lotion bottle and the dispenser plugs into an outlet."
3,Heated lotion dispenser,"The intructions don't tell you how to prime the pump. I was about to send it back when I tried using water first, then transferring the pump to the lotion. After expelling the water the lotion then flowed freely. The biggest complaint I have for this item is that it does not heat very much lotion at a time. One pump's worth, then you have to wait for the next pump to heat up. I hope this helps!!!"
3,ok,This product was not as good as I hoped it would be. The lotion gets a little warm but not quite as warm as I would like. Also the reservoir for the lotion which is actually heated is quite small and after pumping out 2-3 small portions one has to wait for the new portion which has entered the reservoir to be warmed which is impractical.
3,"Not great, but okay","This is the same lotion warmer that is used by the nail salon I go to. The good things: It heats up the lotion quite fast (I think under 2 minutes), and it's not a bad looking unit. The bad thing: You have to wait a little time between pumps for the lotion to re-heat if you're using a lot of it to cover large areas of your body. All in all, I'm glad I bought it."
2,Lukewarm at best,"What a disappointment. This dispenser looks terrific but barely warms the lotion, no matter how long you leave it heating. Don't waste your money."
2,Doesnt get very warm,"The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm. So if you want to use a lot of lotion, you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up. I have dry skin so I put lotion all over. Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up, it isn't super warm."
3,Good but could be better.,"The lotion warmed quickly, and it is a great product to have, but the lotion could be even warmer. The handle gets slippery once you have lotion on your hands, making it easy to knock over the dispenser. The dial is also impossible to adjust once you have put any lotion on your hands. Unfortunately this is the best item to warm lotion on the market, and I am not sure it is worth $100. Someone could do well if they created a lower cost and more efficient version of this item."
3,Pay more attention.,I say that because I did not do so and ended up with a roll of labels but not the reel needed to use them.
5,Sweet Dancehall Rythms!!!!,"The entire CD is slammin' with good dancehall. It's not all ""sooped"" up to be a cross-over pop hit. It's one of Shabba's best. The tracks are not necessarily hardcore, but the beats the lyrics and Shabba's ""gruff"" voice set the CD off lovely. A must have CD for all the dancehall junkie's out there."
4,Good stuff...,"Since Enemy of The Music Business, ND is back to playing very inspired grindcore with a tad of death metal. Recommended to any Napalm fan new or perhaps even the older fans of the first couple of LP's. Can't say enough good things about this disc...Also people really need to check out Time Waits For No Slave- which to me is the finest hour the band's produced. Just my opinion."
5,ND at its best,"This CD along with other's by Napalm Death is just straight hate with simplistic fast paced audio assault. In this album the hate continues with the songs ""The silence is Deafening"" and ""the code is red... long live the code"" with classic and unwavering grindcore to the max. If you loved the older albums and or can put up with the noise then take a listen and you won't be disappointed!"
5,the grandfathers of British grindcore never let up,"Napalm Death have reached the point in their career where they are past experimentation, evolution, or any other form of change. and I don't mean this in a bad way. Napalm are one of those bands that know what they are, they're proud of it, and they ain't changing for anyone... ever. by now, you pretty much know what you're getting with a N.D. album. the only thing that is ever unexpected are the rare guest artists, but that's pretty much it. with their brand of music, the ultimate goal is to be as raw, fast, brutal, intense, and loud as they possibly can along with some politically charged, violent lyrics. and thats basically what you have here with this album. I honestly feel that The Code Is Red stands up to any of the older Napalm albums such as Fear Emptiness Despair. this record hits you like a god-damned freight train and is gone before you know what hit you."
3,Fun rather than serious,"Inflates easily with care to balance both sides evenly. My 85kg husband felt a little cramped but said the challenge made him work harder, so that's good. Length wise the kayak is short so you yawn left and right but generally go in the right direction. The width of the tubes in the centre provide very good general stability and can handle body weight without bowing into the water. There are handy Velcro straps to hold the paddle to the topside whilst not in use and sturdy attachment/drag handle at the front.Fun and perfectly reasonable for the price. Great for kids and ladies. If you want something more serious you have to spend more bucks."
2,It is old stuff,"I am a professional trainer in APICS CSCP. The course material is very good and is maintained every year, to keep it valid. The APICS CSCP material is the state of the art in Supply Chain Management. When you pass the APICS exam voor CSCP, you may use the title behind your name. This is a signal that you have deserved a degree in supply chain management, that is the standard in the market voor supply chain education. I give a low rate, because the material offered is old (2010 version) and does comply with the exam contents, that APICS establishes each year. For the year 2011 you need the 2011 courseware!"
4,"Should be advertised as a cat shelter, too.","It's a nice shelter for our outdoor cat that adopted us but it does leak. Rain does have a way of getting inside it, so I put in under our garage roof. I suppose that duct tape could be used to cover the slots. Styrofoam was added for insulation. Straw makes a warm bedding. I 've also evevated it off the ground."
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie, a little older but is a classic. Laugh from start to end, you can't go wrong with this movie."
5,Great Movie...RENT IT!,"This is the type of film that makes the liberal establishment in Hollywood nuts. No wonder it got such lousy reviews.I think you can pretty fairly say this is the most satisfying film around for any guy who's been taken for a ride by a psycho-chick. (And that's just about all of us.)This movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD funny, and completely audacious in it's conception and execution. I strongly suggest you grab it next time you're at the video store. (Just don't expect to get any if you watch it with your girl.)Jeff Franklin and French Stewart should be proud, and if Hollywood ever gives them 10 cents to make another movie, they should. It was great, guys."
5,A Great Fun Movie!,"I love this movie. If I need a good laugh, want a great laugh, feel a little bored, whatever, this is one of the movies I turn to. I love hearing people laugh and exclaim over it who have never seen it before too! You will not be dissapointed with this, so buy with confidence!"
1,If you thought this was funny your nuts,"Could not believe from reading the reviews that people actually thought this was funny. Did not laugh at all, We even turned it off after an hour. All of the characters were not believable which you do need in a comedy. I think of funny movies such as office space, shrek or even My cousin Vinny those are funny I like French Stewart but are we to believe that he would have left his high paying job to look for a cat. Come on this stunk"
4,Love Stinks is a great date movie...,"This feature just has that campy, date flick style written all over it. Two people joined in the institution of dating take a severe turn into disaster when one is ready for marriage immediately and the other is just getting started. The entire film takes a lot of silly twists and turns into a very comical ending that just sends it over the top. Good movie for a couple thinking of getting engaged or divorced!"
4,Loved it!!,"I used to have this movie on VHS and watched it very regularly. It's the type of movie that just gets funnier the more you watch it. This relationship was sick from the very beginning and it was pure humor watching it unfold to a brilliant conclusion. Some of the one-liners in this movie are truly unforgettable.I don't think the critics liked it and I noticed the few poor reviews here on Amazon. Based on their own reviews, it appears these people were looking for something in this movie that it was never meant to be.It's over-the-top humor. It's not meant to be realistic, just funny. Sometimes you sit down to watch a movie and suspend reality for the sake of just laughing and having a good time. Everything is not meant to be analyzed and applied. This is pure entertainment, nothing more. So if you are the serious type that resists spending time doing or watching things that don't have real meaning or purpose, don't even go here. This movie requires surrender and a love of the absurd."
4,Im still laughing about this one!,"When I rented this movie, I didn't expect too much. I was very surprized by the end result. This movie starts off a little slow, but by mid movie the antics between French Stewart and Bridgette Wilson will have you laughing your butt off. Overall, this movie is very funny, I haven't laughed this hard in a while. I can't wait to add it to my collection! Buy this!"
4,Good for a laugh!,"This was a pretty good movie, but if I was just starting to date somebody I really liked I wouldn't want to watch it with them because it would probably make them really nervous. But it's funny as hell if you're already in a great relationship with someone you love!"
1,IS THIS THE RIGHT PICTURE?,THE PICTURE SHOWS AN INTAKE MANIFOLD BUT THE DESCRIPTION IS FOR SOMETHING ELSE? WHAT IS BEING SOLD IN THIS AUCTION?
1,Toooo Big for Suitcases,"I bought this lock thinking that it would be the right size for my various travel suitcases.Sure enough, as previous reviews have mentioned, this lock was tooo thick to fit through the holes of any suitcase! It was tremendously heavy as well.It's a great sturdy lock worthy of the Masterlock name.....just don't buy it for your suitcase. You have been warned."
1,Check your luggage first.,"I bought these locks to go on my luagge. They seem pretty sturdy but are much too wide to be put through the holes in my bag zippers, and I've had to return them. I haven't measured how wide the locks are, but my bags are pretty typical in size; if they don't fit on my bags my best guess is they won't fit yours either."
1,Worst lock ever,"I bought 3 of these, set the combo the same for all 3. I have used the ""set your own combo"" locks before. Only 1 of the locks set correctly. The other 2 are worthless and the store will not take them back since the combos have been set to who knows what!"
1,Worst Book Ever,"I found this to be the worst NCLEX book I have seen. The questions on the CD were the exact same in the book. You also had to go through a 180 question test...they had no quizzes nor could you stop and start the test again. While this is one of the cheapest on Amazon, it is the last one I would recommend."
1,Insufficient study questions...,"This book/study guide is very thorough. I have a major issue with the exam questions though. It does give you a sample test you can take. That is excellent in prep work for the actual exam. However, it doesn't allow you to answer questions whenever you want. It also restricts your number of times you can use the disk you purchased. Finally, it doesn't allow you to answer questions according to functional systems.I wanted to use this during my time in 4th semester to answer questions during med-surg. No can do. If you want to use the disk, it is an all or nothing process. Sit down and take the exam for an hour and a half or not at all. You have two cracks at it, so if you screw up and launch the cd to see what's on it... tough luck, you have one use left.I'm not impressed. Unfortunately I wasted my cash on it and now have to find one to fit the bill. Look elsewhere if you want a dynamic question practice routine. This one is for pre-test only."
1,The CD doesn't run on a Mac.,I wish I could review the book but I can't. I have a Mac and can't run the CD. I have totally wasted my money.Almost every nursing book I've bought in the last two years has had a CD and every one of them has worked. I just went back through the description on Amazon and can't find a reference to the fact that you have to be running windows. So if you have a Mac stay away from this book.
4,bought this as a gift......,"for an LVN i work with to help her pass her RN exam. So far she says it has been helpful but i am still waiting for her to take the exam.......1/2013 update...should have done this long ago. lvn passed on first exam and said this book was a great help!!! It's been way too long since I studied the NCLEX, but i believe this is also the book me n my study group used..... good luck students!!!!! and welcome to the world of nursing, i wish you all the best!!!!!"
1,Beware,Please beware of the poor customer services of this publisher. I called them several times and had never got any reply.
5,A Very Good Reference!,The Kaplan NCLEX-RN is a very good reference. Highly recommended! You will be taught how to answer questions with many strategies. You will be able to practice answering questions by book and by CD also. Grab it!
5,NCLEX-RN Exam 2008-2009,This product is a favorite of both students and educators in the ADN program in which I teach. For a number of years now we have recommended it to help students prepare for their NCLEX-RN. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn HOW to answer NCLEX style questions. This is not a content mastery book but a strategies book.
5,Excellent Study Guide,"This book is an excellent resource when studying for the NCLEX, I would recommend this to anyone preparing to take the NCLEX.Thank you"
5,If you want to pass the NCLEX......,get this book! You won't regret it! I bought FOUR review books and this one proved invaluable! (the others proved to be a waste of my money!)
3,"decent, not the greatest","i would recommend the ""Saunders Comprehensive Review NCLEX-RN Examination"" instead of this one. The Kaplan book teaches how to take the exam but the Saunders book does that in addition to a review of the main points."
4,Great product,"This is a great book to help you prepare for applying AND studying for the NCLEX-RN exam. I bought this book after graduation from nursing school, but you should get it at the beginning of your final semester to help with applying to your state board and signing up with Pearson Vue. It has great strategies and practice questions. I passed the exam on the first try with only 75 questions!"
4,NCLEX-RN,The book came quickly and was priced fairly and will help anybody who is preparing to take the NCLEX-RN exam.
1,flimsy and too loud,"We got this for our 4 year old. Right away, certain CD's wouldn't spin up in the player. Even though there is a separate volume control for the 2 mics and the music, if you turn the mic volume all the way down you still can't hear the music through the vocals. The speakers are lousy, but that might be expected on what is essentially a toy. Don't expect anywhere near decent boom-box speaker quality. The whole thing rattles with the vocals. There is an echo effect that you can control the delay on, so you get this long echo or a shorter one just to enhance the vocals. That's about the only cool part. Also, it doesn't come with a power cord, so batteries only unless you pay extra for the cord. We ended up returning the thing to the store very disappointed. Even if the spin-up problem turned out to be a glitch, we were so unimpressed with it in general that we didn't want a replacement."
1,This is a stupid waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this for christmas last year and it is a total waste of money .the cd and tape that come with it are cheap and have totally dorky songs on them.this toy isnt worth 1 penny. I hope that this review was helpful.:]
1,Awful - do not buy this,My daughter got this for her birthday. It would not spin the CDs. I called customer service listed in the instructions and they told me that I could mail it in for repair. They would not refund my shipping costs. Awful product - do not buy it.
3,Our Daughter likes it,"It's cheap. It's not even coming with an AC plug; you need 6x large batteries. I was looking for an AC adapter tonight, cannot find it here. I tried many AC adapter we had at home and none worked. The CD player is very sensible to jumps if kids are jumping near by. Sometimes we need to open-close the CD door a couple of times to get the CD spinning. It's ""very"" cheap. But we got it for our 7 years old daughter (not us), its working fine for her and she loves singing in Karaoke with her favorite Hannah Montana!"
3,Half Works,"This was a present from Santa. Unfortunately, Santa's quality control team forgot to check the microphone which doesn't work (in either mic jack). It would be helpful to have a link to Barbie karaoke CDs as well."
4,Great size good informaion,This is a great pocket ref. I have this as pocket ref and stedman's a a desk ref and it works very well.
2,Could Have Done Better,"Filter worked fine once I taped it to the rear of the unit. The little for a better name hooks kept slipping out, they attach to the back of the humidifier case and are supposed to hold the filter in place. Do believe that I could have gone and bought a filter and taped it on myself for far less money."
3,AirCare Filter,I haven't used them yet. One came with the humidifier so I will wait for another season before i use these.
2,No bang for the buck,"I have always used these and thought I had one for this year's winter season. When I found I didn't, I was about to order one until I saw the price. WAAYYY too expensive for the purpose. I'm sure they do what they're supposed to, but what are they - solid platinum? I will listen to the reviewer who used a furnace filter and duct tape. I can't believe I ever used these unless they were much cheaper when I used them before.Spend your twenty bucks on a replacement wick, this is ridiculous."
5,"Julio, Iglesias, a fine discovery","Starry Night is my first album by Julio, but it will not be my last. This one album has elevated him to the top of my favorite male singers list. His performance of Mona Lisa tops Nat King Cole."
5,Love-Love Songs-Love-wonderful-hot sexy spanish voices Julio,"Julio is one of those guys that every women wishes she could have. He has a awesome voice that makes you want to weep, when he sings its as he is singing directly into your heart.Love Love songs You will love Juliop.s. the songs in spainsh are even better"
1,Fiesta Bowl,I downloaded the unbox video application but can not view video. Please refund the money for this since I can't see video?
5,Best finish ever in a college football game,"The reactions of the fans as the drama unfolds say it all. At some point, everybody in the stadium was sure their team had won the game, then at some other point everybody was sure their team had lost the game.This game is like a great movie where you know the ending yet you still find yourself on the edge of your seat every time you watch it. Boise State dominated the game and was doing a good job of controlling the ball and burning time as they cruised to victory...or did they? Oklahoma found a way to pull it out...or did they? Boise State had surely been handed a gut-wrenching loss...or had they? Oklahoma got down to business immediately in overtime, finally restoring order to the galaxy. Or did they? Three trick plays executed to perfection. The hero got the girl. Unbelievable."
1,Download problem,"I started the download of the entire game [selection no. 5], but got only 29 seconds of video. What's up with that?"
4,Adolescent angst over the edge,"If you had parents like Rosie, you'd be as messed up as she is too. The setting is as distraught as the characters are. Rosie does things we all sometimes would like to do. Her honesty is startling, and you can't help but feel like you want to give this young naive girl a hug."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,"I was disappointed in ordering this book. The book had lots of scientific information about the relationship and affects between the moon and criminal activities among other theories, it would have been interesting if some of the research mentioned the affect of the moon on other cultures throughout history , mythology, and folk beliefs."
3,their last,This was the bands last album....being kind of a hodgepodge. The first few songs were recorded for the album and the last four were recorded with a new singer. Some good songs...no longer in the satanic vein...including Sleighride..a sort of Christmas song. Interesting.
2,kinda stupid concept,I know there are two small arrows showing the direction where the shackles are supposed to be inserted but guess what who is going to pay attention to those small arrows? I bought two of these locks to lock a cabinet's handles together. It has a nice long shackle to do the job but i accidentally put the shackles the other way around not as arrows indicated. Now not only the combination doesn't work but also the lock is jammed and i have to call a locksmith to open it (this is what their customer service recommended me).
2,The lock got stuck but will buy another one of these...,"This combination lock was exactly what I was looking for. It had the long, bright handle I was looking for but the MAJOR PROBLEM with this was that IT IS POORLY MARKED. The arrows on the side of the lock point upwards which made me think the lock had to be slid into the prongs in that direction but instead the arrows are for the prongs so you can know which way to slide in the prongs. Bottom line, the markings are ambiguous and cost me $9.76c plus shipping. The combination lock got jammed because apparently I slid it in the ""wrong"" way and now I have to replace it.I am giving this a 2-star and not a 1-star because I just ordered another another copy of this one. I haven't found another combination lock on Amazon that has the features I'm looking for. Only this time, I will mark it myself with marker at the top saying ""IN"" or something. Good product but fails due to poor and ambiguous usage directions."
3,"Nice, but not great","This documentary looks like it was originally done for TV in Argentina. Although it has English subititles where needed, I found the constant going back and forth between English and Spanish to be distracting. That said, it follows Ms. Herrera's career from her start in South America to her, now, over ten year career with ABT. There are some nice scenes of the dancer being coached for various roles, but the photography isn't terribly well placed. She finishes behind a pillar in a number of the scenes. I would have liked to see more performance footage. I'd rather have gotten this DVD at the library than paid for it."
3,Interesting story but little dancing,I found this to be an interesting story about the career of Paloma. We hear fromsome of her coaches. There are comments from the artistic director of ABT. I wouldhave liked much more footage of Paloma dancing in a live performance in front ofan audience. We only get about 10 minutes. This dvd is good but not essential.
4,Pleasing Paloma,"Lovely dancer, beautiful ballerina. Her work is displayed with an eye to the viewer's pleasure, and her history is presented succinctly, but with warmth. I enjoyed the video, and would recommend it to balletomanes everywhere."
5,Works great for me,These have great visibility for my poor eyes. My range's free targets are large black bullseyes so I use one of these to see the center.
4,"Skillfully done, and entertaining.","The preceeding reviews have done enough to describe the plot and development of the book, so I will simply say I enjoyed reading it greatly. Spencer does a fine job exploring the characters and their emotional development. Recommended for any reader of modern fiction."
2,Disappointed .,"I went along for the ride with Mr. Spencer, and for the longest time I thought we were going somewhere...together. Ultimately ,Sam Holland comes across as a confused man. A helpless male. A jerk who cheats on the wife he loves because he can't control the monster behind his zipper. A man who practices unsafe sex with the woman he casually sleeps with. But hey, that's fine because at story's end his wife tells him that she has slept with a private detective (with a penis so large that it caused her pain as it bumped her cervix) and she wants Sam to know that the guy ""refused to wear a condom"" (""and that just enraged me"") so she may have ""picked up a disease.""From the disturbed son who lives in the woods and robs houses, to the throw-away adultery motif Men In Black ultimately left me feeling like I had just spent time with some very annoying, very dumb people who (at the heart of it all) are, quite simply, their own worst enemies.Kevin Ormsby, Niagara Falls, NY"
2,"Too Sketchy, It Never Quite Comes Together","While ""Men in Black"" has its moments, its overall feel is more of a sketch or an outline for a story than a fully-developed one. Spencer's prose style is excellent and it does draw you in, but too many story strands are left dangling. Sub-plots, in particular one about his runaway son's adventure, are begun and then effectively dropped. That one and two other important ones are resolved ""off-stage"", their results told to the protagonist toward the end of the book. Characters, like Sam's father and his wife's sister, are brought into the story and dropped immediately, wasting page space. This novel is about average in length, just as I like, but I actually think it could have benefitted from about fifty more pages to better flesh out its intertwined plot. While its random events are life-like, they don't make for a very satisfying story. Here's hoping that in the future Spencer can develop a solid story to benefit from his great prose ability."
3,Vapid Victorian,"The Cameo Club is a thoroughly forgettable mystery. It takes place in Michigan, in a small town during the fall. The heroine, Katherine Kale, has just moved here and bought a blue house with mysterious noises. Sound familiar--like a lot of second rate mysteries? Well, it is. A couple of people die, Katherine discovers some clues, she agonizes through selecting between two indistinguishable suitors, someone tries to kill her, and the murderer (whom the reader had guessed in the first third of the book) is discovered in a standoff in Katherine's kitchen. One of the suitors saves her, she falls in love with him, and the novel ends with a kiss that 'burns like fire' and Katherine proclaiming ""you are mine"".Sound familiar--like a lot of second rate mysteries? Well, it is."
2,Good Idea - Bad Execution,"Neat idea: portable, disposable string cleaner. Seems simple enough. It just doesn't work that well: even mildly dirty strings aren't cleaned much, and if they're more than a little dirty, it does nothing. Plus, it leaves a strange residue on everything, and you should read the warnings on the label ""in case of ingestion."" It makes it sound like you'll die within moments of consuming. You're better off with a lint-free rag and any of the dozens of spray cleaners out there. It's a shame Ernie Ball is dead, because I don't know that he'd put his name on this product if he were still with us."
2,Doesn't work,"I tried these wipes hoping they'd be a cheaper way to make my strings last longer, but they don't really. They clean off some of the dirt and grime, but the strings barely end up lasting longer. I maybe get an extra week out of them (i play bass every day, and like a bright, piano-like tone). There's another wipe i just tried too that worked much better - called Bass Brites. More expensive, but they actually work."
3,A Good Buy,"This camera is excellent for tourists. Not good for taking close up family photos, unless you want them to pose at the end of the road :).When the battery is finished all the images that is stored in the Camera goes, so beware."
1,Not worth $15,I bought this a few months ago. When taking a picture the pic comes out blurry. The binos are bad so is the camera. Not worth the money at all.
2,The camera hits my nose,"The optics aren't bad for 10x25 binoculars. The camera is in a bad location and it makes them difficult to use. Uncomfortable because the camera hits my nose. My camera is only 3x, not 10x, so the pictures don't look the same as what you see in the binoculars. Mine didn't come with rechargeble batteries and I had to use AAA's. They don't last long. I took away 3 stars because the camera is kind of lame, but the binocular portion isn't bad. Gave them to my friend for his kids to use."
2,Can't read the letters,"I feel that the backlit aspect is overrated as you can't read the keys with it. It actually makes reading the keys harder than easier as the brightness ""blinds"" the player to normal light from the screen that would normally help illuminate the letters.However, it is likely to be beneficial to those who are good typers and who don't need to see the letters to know which keys are what. I tried using the extra part in place of the keyboard but found it to be too limiting in most games."
4,great keyboard,"its pretty much like a standard keyboard except it has the game pad with it, the saitek eclipse does not have the game pad but has laser cut lettering so the light goes through the lettering, whereas this keyboard is just on the outside of the keys, it looks cool but dont depend on seeing the keys with just that lightneedless to say the game pad is pretty easy to figure out , one can put together a simple to medium game setup, it can do more complex things , and it has a software manual, but i'm not that motivated.but it does help in games like world of warcraft or everquest.the keys are light to the touch and not real loud, but not super silent either . the keyboard is definetley worth the price, amazon was cheaper than anywhere else i looked,the only thing with the game pad is it should of had a indicater of what mode was on, but again thats for more advanced gamersits a good buy"
5,Awesome board,"Just an all around good board. The keys are very fluid, response rate is excellent. Side command pad is programmed similiar to old sidewinder controllers using profiles which work well. This board increased my response rate in WOW making me even more lethal using the command pad."
2,Great keyboard unless.....,".....you use a KVM switch between 2 computers. I currently use a Linksys KVM2KIT switch with my Logitech Elite USB keyboard and my USB Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer. I have them plugged into the switch with PS2 to USB adapters. They've worked flawlessy from day one this way. I can plug the Gamer's Keyboard into the switch this way and it will not work at all. The saving grace is that it can be used on either of my machines as a stand-alone keyboard, but this just isn't my configuration. Unfortunately I'm going to have to RMA this keyboard. Just beware of this if you use a permanent switch."
3,OK keyboard,"I am a long time computer user, I started programming on main frames and mini-computers back in the 1960s, FORTRAN 2. I am also a computer gamer. This is a well lit, works fine, easy to use keyboard. I do not use the hand rests, I do not need them. I do not use the remote keypad, cute but not useful. I am a Mac user most of the time and the keyboard only came with PC drivers. Since the programmers who wrote the software do not seem to have the skill set to let them compile for both PC and Mac it is a crippled device. It is trivial to do both and I do it all the time, there is no excuse for a half way job. If it does not work with everything then it can not be given higher than average ratings. However it does follow the standards in that it does work with both PCs and Macs as a standard keyboard, it is the advanced features that the Mac user can not use."
5,Blue Thunder!,"It's so cool to play this keyboard... there I am... blue lights glowing all around me, and I'm just let'n 'er rip! This keyboard is great for first person shooter games. 27 programmable macros! It takes on the competition, like a bully in a school yard. Awesome stuff!!"
3,"A nice keyboard, but...","I'm pretty disappointed. I bought this keyboard to play games in the dark, but when the room is dark I can't see the keys at all. I liked the idea of the macro pad and assumed it was the same as the Saitek Eclipse. I was quite wrong. If you want a keyboard for use in a darkened room this ISN'T the one. :(Otherwise, it was an alright keyboard. The design was nice and it typed well.Needless to say I'm returning this and getting the Saitek Eclipse!"
1,"Worst keyboard ever, forget about ""gaming.""","Good:*Looks neat in the picture*Has a cool shape to it, and has a nice weight to it*The extra programmable keypad is a cool ideaBad:*The backlighting only lights up behind the keys so there is no indication which key is which (The other Saitek that is backlit has laser-etched keys so each number/letter is visible)*The keys don't return quickly, they have a mushy feel to them when pushing down on themOverall, this keyboard is terrible. I thought my laptop keyboard was bad... I'd rather type on that (or play games on it) any day over this abomination. I sent mine back after owning it for less than 4 hours - it was that bad."
1,substandard support,"No support for XP SP2 at this late date? Fiddling with drivers, you can use either, but not both: keyboard OR command pad."
5,A very excellent movie. Gary Cooper was astounding!!!,"If you like Gary Cooper and American history, you will love this movie. It has a truly magnificent cast and a great setting."
5,UNCONQUERED,GARY COOPER IN A DEMILLE COLOR FILM. A REAL BLAST FROM THE PAST AND A GOOD SUPPORTING CAST TOO.VERY PROMPT DELIVERY AND A GOOD PRICE TOO.
3,Unconquered,"An realistic coalition between Cooper and Goddard as ""owner"" and ""indentured servant"" in Colonial period, with far-fetched, unrealistic resulting situations."
3,Classic movie,Good quality. It was a good clean movie that you can watch with the family. Classic movie for anyone's collections.
4,Beautiful Movie,"It had been years since I had seen this movie, and that on VHS on a small TV (and a tape that was missing the ending!). Seeing the DVD, I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and all the detail.Goddard is beautiful in this movie and Cooper is ... Cooper. I love Gary Cooper but my only knock against this movie is that he seemed to be playing Gary Cooper more than any other character.This movie is non-PC, long even while cramming in a lot of story at a pace that sometimes seems hurried, and an excellent way to spend an evening. Wonderful job on the video and audio transfer, too."
5,Colonial America: Colonist vs. Indians,"This is one of Gary Cooper's better movies. Also stars Ward Bond, Paulette Goddard, and Boris Karloff. Cooper meets an indentured servant (Goddard) on the boat returning to America from England. Also on the boat is a gunrunner (Howard da Silva) who is selling guns to the Indians. Goddard is owned by da Silva and Cooper buys her freedom. De Silva reneges on the sale and takes Goddard westward with him as he delivers the guns to the Indians. Cooper finds out about Goddard and the guns and goes off to find the guns and Goddard. On the way he deals with hostile Indians, da Silvas henchmen and survival on the frontier. He eventually saves the day, gets the girl and the bad guys and defeats the Indians. One of Coopers best with lots of action and romance. Based somewhat on actual events in and around Fort Venango, Fort Ligonier, and Fort Pitt and the Battle of Bushy Run in Penna. Good story and well acted. Don't miss!!"
4,Action filled saga of the French-Indian War,"Made during the golden age of Hollywood, this is an excellent historical drama that takes place during the French-Indian War with Gary Cooper in the lead role as a plantation owner/explorer who falls for an enduntured servant portrayed by Paulette Goddard.While the story-plot is ficticious, it blends well with the historical saga of the French-Indian War. The relationship between the French and their Indian allies and the British and the American Colonialists. The only exception that is kind of far fetched is having Boris Karloff as the evil indian chief, but that can be overlooked since it is the immortal Boris Karloff and his superb acting.Overall the action, the plot and the technicolor, which was new when this was filmed, makes this a movie that fans of historical drama and action would enjoy."
3,Hokey De Mille epic!,"""Unconquered"" is a silly movie which provides more evidence that ole Cecil B. couldn't direct traffic let alone a major epic. That being said it is still a fun movie if one can overlook the absurd plot twists and Paulette Goddard's lack of talent.One note on the history being portrayed in the movie: I've noticed that several reviewers believe this movie is set during the French and Indian War (1754-1763.) It's not. ""Unconquered"" is set in the period immediately following the F&I War when New France had already become British Canada. During this period the Indians of the Great Lakes region, under the leadership of an Ottawa chief called Pontiac, rose against the British conquerors because of restrictive British trade policies and in the forlorn hope of encouraging a French return to North America which would restore a trade balance. Pontiac's so called ""rebellion"" is the setting of ""Unconquered"" not the French and Indian War."
1,I Had to Cry Uncle....,"and shut this movie off, even though I probably was THIS close to the end, because I just couldn't stand it anymore! Totally bad.Paulette Goddard is having a hard time as an indentured servant in a frontiersy New World, even with Gary Cooper around. But how can this be in any way exciting when the villain is....Howard Da Silva??? Oh, c'mon, who was he, the understudy to the real star cast?Some things are best left alone, and ""Unconquered"" is one of them."
3,Plenty of Examples but Light on Solid Written Content,"The books is a copmrehensive discussion of business card design and etiquitte. There are literally hundreds of cards in here, with plenty of ideas and feedback for the reader. The keys include habving a readable and distinctive business card, one that fits your business profile, and making sure you actually use them. On the downside, the book doesn't really give any bad examples or things to avoid, and the bulk of the book is just business card after business card examples - with about 30 pages of real meaty content. Good to peruse and get you thinking, but not a must read or must have."
2,Crappy Don't Buy,Held my daughters attention about 1 week. Nothing cool about it. Just makes the dolls fly over it. They had more fun laughing at how rediculous it made barbies look than they did using it they right way. Better stuff out there. It has already been thrown away and she just got it at christmas.
4,Athletic barbies for a change!,"Having a small 5 year old niece that adores gimnastics...This was the toy to buy! Not difficult to set and use, dolls have many different flips. It's a fun toy."
2,Barbie's downfall,Barbie is a great icon and so what little gymnist wouldn't want a Barbie gymnastics set?!? There are too many pieces to loose and the Barbies just don't flip well. It's a pain in the rear for parents having to fix all the problems.
2,"haunting, yes...gripping, no","I had to force myself to keep reading this book. By the end one can understand character motives much better, and this ties some things together, but it was not worth the investment. The book could have been great, but the haunting story was told in such an awkward way as to not make it worth the time to read."
3,Takes a long time to go anywhere,"Several times as I read this story, I thought, ""Yeah, that's exactly the way I feel!"" But most of the time, I was rather impatient with the repetitiveness of the flashbacks and the somewhat overwritten, overwrought details of Nathan's story. Yes, the novel has some interesting insights, but one has to dig for them. Is it worth the effort? You'll have to answer that for yourself."
1,Couldn't get past the first 17 pages - too boring,"I bought the book in a bookstore - I read the back cover and thought it would be an interesting read. WRONG! I couldn't get past the first 17 pages it was so boring. Very broken and disjointed, and I couldn't care less what was happening. I put it down and never picked it back up again. I figured life is too short to force myself to read something that boring. I kept reading the same paragraphs over and over again, but my mind kept wandering. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Ambivalent,"I echo Artic Fox's review. I'd just read ""The Mercy of Thin Air"" - also narrated by a dead person - and truly a haunting, moving book. It was clear from the beginning that ""Death of An Ordinary Man"" had a different agenda.It was good enough for me to keep reading it, but only a chapter at a time. The narrative style - while certainly introspective and thought provoking (assuming you are terrifically moved by the book) - was rambling, and I skimmed places. Then I'd have to go back and read it because suddenly I'd be like, ""Whaaaaa?""It didn't really move me, but it was well written for that style. If you really dig the first few chapters, you'll love the book. If you find yourself iffy on it, or bored - you might as well put it down because I doubt it will grab you when you get further in."
2,Fails to suck the reader in,"However that's not to say it fails to suck in general. I'm the type of reader that gets pulled into a story and has to read a book cover to cover. I have to suffer through this one. Blah blah blah for the first half of the book... come on Glen, throw us a bone dude. He actually comes close to giving us a piece of the puzzle halfway when he teases us into thinking he's going to tell us how the daughter dies. Then bam it's a cliffhanger. I guess he thinks we'll sit through 100 more pages of pretentious whiny [...] before we get to it. 2 stars for this one. I wish I could get my ten bucks back."
2,Ho Hum,"I just couldn't get into it--and I tried! It was well-reviewed by someone I usually agree with, but this just did not work for me."
5,A Talented Author,"Seldom have I seen such a powerfull first effort from a rookie author. Mr. Jacobson spins an intriguing tale, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Slightly disappointed,I thought these looked amazing online. When I got them the lace part at the top wasn't that thick and not very gripping and rolled. Also the fish netting was rather large and my toes ended up going through.
3,The Sicilian - Original Motion Picture Score,"Oddly enough I've owned this compact disc since it was released. Having never seen the motion picture I cannot give a narrative as the soundtrack relates to the production film. I can, however, critique the score. There are only several tracks with more than two minutes of play. Many of the tracks last just under a minute and are typical ""filler"" pieces. Sadly, the composer has done much better work on his spaghetti westerns than on this relatively recent release. If you are trying to find a score with more ""umph"", try to locate ""The Untouchables"" soundtrack. If you just want to pop a disk into the player for background music at home or on a long road trip from Kansas City to Denver - you could listen to it twice before even realizing it had repeated!"
2,"Too basic, Montauk is much better","This book is simply too short and generic to be of use. As an applicant, I can confidently say that the Montauk book (""How to get into the top MBA Programs"") is much more comprehensive and overall better. If you want more specific info on the top programs (i.e. so you can tailor your essays or prepare for interviews), complement Montauk with ""ABC of Getting the MBA Admissions Edge"". Although at first blush ""Your MBA Game Plan"" aims to cover both the fundamentals, like Montauk, and the specifics like ""ABC"", it falls short on both counts. The only good thing about this book (compared to the other two) is that it is small and light, so easy to carry anywhere :)"
1,Sooo disappointing...,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This book is awful. The authors are a couple of MBA message board skulkers I know from a couple of years back. Their strategies fall into two basic categories: 1) original ideas that were not thought through or have become obsolete, and 2) ideas gleaned from other MBA self-help guides, most of which are either obsolete or were never effective.A poor effort all around. In their defense, the economy and MBA educational environment and focus is changing so fast that it's difficult to have a plan that works for all seasons -- but this one seems to have nothing to offer.Wait til it goes deep-discount (which it surely will soon) or buy it used (cheap). Until then, you are wasting your money."
5,I'm glad that I have this book!,"I decided to apply to business school pretty late in the game. Knowing that I had a lot of work to do, I did a lot of research into which books and resources were on the market. After looking around and talking to people, I decided to give this book a shot. IT HAS LIVED UP TO ITS REPUTATION! It is very complete, covering everything about the application process. It covers essays and recommendations like all of the books, but also covers smaller (important) details, like how to set up your resume and when you should consider taking a GMAT class. I have not had to rely on the section about each of the top schools as much, but the advice in there is also really valuable. And the book is very easy to read. It is not a large phone book, like some of the others out there. All in all, you will also be glad that you bought this book!"
4,Good Translator,Unfortunately most Tai Chi books are written as supplements to training already received by the Masters students. The translator for this book points out several instances where there are questions of interpretation and he cross references other works to try and arrive to a meaning as close as possible to what Yang Chen Fu intended. Very informative and enlightening. It has improved my Tai Chi practice and understanding. Based on the text alone I would give this 5 stars. The quality of the pictures is why I only gave it 4 stars. Thats not the publishers or the translators fault but it distracts from an otherwise outstanding book.
4,Its not a start up,"This Book is not simple, but it gives an interesting sigth on Taijiquan. Learn about a simple, yet komplex topic. The book is small enough to be read during a weekend, but each page, each sentence can be a koan about bodymechanics and energy. Its not an introduction für novice taiji players."
3,Standard Text,"While its pretty difficult to learn Tai Chi applications from a book (!), its still worth adding this to the library, for all Yang based stylists"
1,Confusion and Illusion,"Although I confess to taking some pieces away from this book to help me in my learning and progression, I fail to see how this book embodies the 'essence' and 'application' of Taijiquan.Most of the descriptions are elusive, barren, deceptive, and/or nothing but a description of the movement in the air and completely lacking any explanation of an martial application.I think the translator did a good job and made an honest attempt but in the end was attempting to piece together something that was not there or was being intentionally withheld. Translating, researching, and unlocking Chinese writings to include manuals, poems, etc. is a nightmare for Westerners and respect should be paid to his efforts.This still does nothing to resolve the issue that this book is full of misinformation and should be approached by Tai Chi practitioners with open eyes and a skeptic gaze."
4,only the instructor missing,"Just a note to mention totally enjoyable, and a great price! Thank you! Lenny Ramirez, Fairfield, Ca."
3,Outdated,I just received my copy in the mail and skimmed through the entire book in about 4 hours. The make it at home stuff was neat but I thought just buying it already together was faster and cheaper. I got a little bored with it as I already knew just about everything she mentioned thanks to beauty magazines. As always no one mentions Mary Kay products. I tried to look up several websites and many were outdated and the sites were closed. I do plan on returning it and am angry at myself for not noticing the publishing date and that i have to pay shipping again. Don't waste your money! Beauty magazines are just as informational as well as having newer tips and there are so many new products out since this book was published. Since i can't change the stars I should probably make it 1 star.
5,It's all in one place--that's the value,"One reviewer suggested that it was a fault of the book that you could pick up any issue of ""Cosmo, Glamour, or even YM"" and find similar information to what's in this book. Maybe that's true, but how many issues would you have to go through? And how much product-hawking on the part of the beauty editor would you have to sift through first? (I, for one, cancelled my subscription to the beauty magazine Allure because I was tired of the way they seemed to push primarily expensive products, ones that could easily be purchased only in NYC boutiques, or the favorites of this year's ""it"" girl.)This is a no-nonsense guide by a down-to-earth, sensible woman who simply has an interest in beauty. I trust her research and advice more than I do that of most of the shallow, celebrity-loving beauty editors out there. Beauty doesn't have to be silly and expensive."
3,"An excellent book, but already out-dated","This is a wonderful book, but much of the information is now out-dated. In the past 5 years, many new ingredients and products have entered the market. Berg's more general information holds true, but much of this book contains specific ingredients and products that no longer hold true. Eagerly and hopefully anticipating a second edition!"
5,a very good one,"I am a beauty junky, and own almost every beauty book. This one is one of my favorites. I return to it often. It has in-depth information on just about every beauty topic you can think of. It isn't a lot of silliness or pictures with no information.I also like a Web site called BeautyRiot.com. They have all the same kinds of stuff, but it's updated all the time, which is something you can't get with a book no matter how good it is."
3,A good overview for beginers,"This book is a solid release, with good and practical information. Almost everything is covered and covered well. A favorite of mine are the secions that tell you great products for your skin and hair. The information is all very good and is well written, a quick and fun read. I have referred back to it on many occasions.The problem with this beauty book lies within its title. ""THe new BASICS"" This book is just what it says it is, the basics. If you have been a avid fashion and beauty mag. reader for years, you already know everything in this book. However, if you are looking for how to get great skin and how to put on blush, this is the book for you. Clear, well written and informative- but still just the basics."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I'm a big fan of Enchant's early work (Blueprint of the World and Wounded), for you can hear the potential the band had at that time -- it was only a matter of time before they tightened up and exercised some musical discipline. Well, it's finally happened. Unfortunately, they have sacrificed passion and originality to generate, at least in this album, a rather formulaic collection of unmemorable songs. Verse, verse, short bridge, conclusion. Over and over again. No meaningful instrumentals, no building climaxes of music and verse.It's not a bad album, in fact, it is quite similar to Under the Sun which is another pretty decent band. But it certainly isn't a must have, either. Die hard Enchant fan? Then go for it. Otherwise, I would skip this one and spend the money someplace else."
4,Frolicsome and Frisky,"You will want to read this book to your youngster. The rhyme and the rhythm of it will entice you both. Very enjoyable to read aloud. ""Frolicsome and frisky and yet greatly to be feared"" sounds even more fun in a Scottish accent, perhaps a la John Cleese. The pictures are colorful. This is the kind of thing you want to memorize so that you can entertain a little one someday when you are caught in a big traffic jam on the highway."
1,Can Easily Be Pried Open ...,"... with a common hand tool, because they're made of 16 gauge mild steel. (Note to corporate accounting dept: using 12 gauge steel would increase cost per unit by 3 cents, but would differentiate your product and allow you to increase price by 50 cents.) Cheap is one thing, but these offer no security."
5,Very good and very sentimental!,Psalm 151 is very sentimental. You'll always remember it and it stay in your heart forever!
5,"""Testify To Love"" Was A Hit for Avalon, And I Agree on DVDs","The song that was the centerpiece of the 100th episode of ""Touched"" was actually a #1 hit Contemporary Christian song for the Christian pop group, Avalon. It is on the group's 2003 greatest hits album, ""The Very Best of Avalon: Testify to Love"" (which you can buy from Amazon.com). If you liked ""Testify to Love"" you will probably like other Avalon songs.I agree that we need to see all of the seasons of ""Touched By An Angel"" on DVD. I cannot believe this has not already been done. All the Christians I know really loved that show and would buy the DVDs of it in a heartbeat."
5,Wonderful video for any age!,"I just started watching TBAA last season. When I saw the 100th episode I cried for half an hour afterward. To see Petey's mom up there singing God's praise when her son just died made me think about my faith in God. I fell in love with the song ""Testify to Love"" and just received the cd 'A Maze of Grace' by the Christian group Avalon which contains the song."
5,makayla,I love this show I never miss it I even watch reruns that's how much I love it. I saw this episode and almost cried that is how good it was and I never cry on vidoes but this was worth it.
4,"SAPPY, BUT REFRESHING","Rare entertainment sees ""angels"" help the ""little people"" cope with thier many losses and sundrie problems. The heart warming ""have a nice day and wonderful life"" message sometimes gets lost in the pettiness of ""the problem"". Yet it remains a sure change from the murder and mayhem that dominates the screen. PEACE & LOVE TO ALL OF YOU! Starla Paris, Wilkes Isle."
4,A fine intro. to Argentine history for US readers.,"Slatta's book works well when assigned to college undergraduates, because he covers complex and important issues in an engaging style. The subject of gauchos should be fascinating as well to lay readers interested in US cowboys & frontier history, because Slatta provides a clear basis for comparative history. 10-15 years ago it would have deserved a 5-star rating, but ""Gauchos"" has stimulated further research which is beginning to modify, or at least extend, its conclusions (cf. J. Lynch, ""Massacre in the Pampas 1872""). Nevertheless, Slatta's book remains the place to begin expanding one's understanding of New World frontier history."
1,"Not fun, not educational","This is a terrible product. The company put no money into making it: the ""game board"" is a flimsy piece of paper; you have to cut out all the (paper) cards yourself; and then you're given a setup for a crime but have to make up the rest of the story. That can be hard for kids with setups like this typical one about criminals smuggling drugs from Thailand. Do you really want your 6 or 8 year old learning and thinking about drug smuggling? Also, the ""scientific experiments"" are very limited, aren't very interesting, and don't always work. Don't waste your money or time."
5,Great album from great comedian,"This is a great set from Jake Johannsen with some really funny stuff that breaks through the standard comedian style. He engages with the audience in a really entertaining way. A great thing with this album is that you don't lose anything major on the visual side - Johannsen is even funnier to watch his expressions but none of the jokes here really depend on seeing him. This was recorded around the time of the 2000 election and there are some references to that but mostly it is pretty timeless stuff.(The other review here is obviously for some other album - don't worry, this is definitely a Jake Johannsen comedy album.)"
2,Nothing special,I bought this from JC penny for a good deal.The hand rest is very high and little uncomfortable. Massager is of no use as it just vibrates and does no good . i guess i will never turn the massager on again.in my room i have only bed and i used to use pillow as back rest. That way this has substituted well.So it is just ok...dont have high expectation of this product.
3,Ultimate Relaxation System Massage Chair,"This chair is pretty good. The massage function is a little too much to take on the highest setting and the heat function gets very hot. All-in-all, this is a very relaxing chair."
3,BR,Bought as a gift for my wife. She found it too firm and the light is weak. I returned it. Heat & massage worked good.
3,READ CAREFULLY,"The item is good when you use it while in bed, like I do when I have my laptop on my knees but I would recommend to buy a similar item, maybe at a better price, without massage and heat. This is a real waste of money"
2,not happy,"I use to have a $10. corduroy bed pillow with arms. It was quite comfortable...did the job for sitting up watching TV or reading. This ""lounger"" is not only pricy, it is uncomfortable. The heat is barely noticeable and the ""massage"" is only annoying. However my biggest complaint is that the light is totally useless! It gives out very very little light. You cant read by it. Most annoying to me is the fact that I was dumb enough to buy TWO!"
1,Cheap and Uncomfortable,"The arms became loose and floppy within a few days.The massage is more irritating than relaxing.It does not support the small of the back. I have to put an additional pillow behind me to be comfortable, which kinda defeats the purpose.The bottom line is that I am disappointed with this product."
1,don't bother,"I bought this tape set to listen to in the car on the way to work. Unfortunately it was a big disappointment. I expected some professional help for a working professional but what I got was some childish play with bad ethnic voice imitations that would probably offend several ethnic groups. Some of the information seems to be outdated although the copyright is 1998. This tape set sounds more like a college freshman's attempt at getting a ""C"" in a writing class. No useful information here."
2,It's smaller than it looks,"This knife iss small than it looks, not only that holding it is uncomfortable, The sheath also sucks, makes a good back up if modified (duct taped to a backpack strap)"
5,Good Luggage Lock,"This is a great small lock for a luggage or some other application where are small lock is required. Although, this is for low-security purposes."
4,A Beautiful Instrumental Christmas CD,"Tim Janis and his ensemble produce beautiful soft instrumental music--and this cd is no exception. The music's focal point is Tim Janis' piano and keyboards with some soothing strings, flute, and acoustic guitar thrown in for good measure. The song selection is strong with most of the traditional classics nicely covered. This disc is somewhat on the short side (less than 29 mintues long), but does an excellent job putting the listener in the Christmas spirit. A perfect selection for those with multi-disc cd players. Recommended."
2,Doesn't work,"The thermometer is well built, very sturdy BUT did NOT work for me at all. I believe the needle may be stuck."
5,It works,Not sure what to write in this review. It works and it's cool because it has a nice little reference right on the face that tells you what temperature you need to reach for each different type of meat.
2,For Hardcore Only,This cocert was shot by a child the picture quality was terrible the sound quality was worse the only good thing to say about this DVD is the set selection. I knew this in advance but like i'm a HARDCORE fan and this is the only concert on DVD that I know of. If anyone knows of another let me know through this review section.
3,"It works, kinda...","David Ott has a 2nd mortgage at the Bank Of Shostakovich... same low string writing, tendency to 2-part counterpoint, chromatic shifts in fast melody, woodwinds doubled with xylophone, bombastic finales. He has a bad tendency to repeat short motives literally and needlessly, his ideas aren't distinctive, and his handling of rhythm is pretty pedestrian. On the positive side, he keeps a piece going forward, and there's a certain familiarity and attractiveness in the language. He writes well for orchestra. There's even a ""wow"" moment (entrance of the harp in the slow movement of #3.) If you're looking for big tonal dramatic symphonies, aren't too demanding about individual voice, don't mind a few quartal chords and the occasional really crunchy dissonance, this may be for you. It's an excellent performance."
3,One size fits most vehicles!,"If you have a 16"" steering wheel, I'm sure it will fit perfectly!My car has a 15"" steering wheel. As a result, the looseness prohibits the upper hook on the left side from engaging the steering wheel. The right side (bar end) engages firmly along with the lower hook on the left side providing 2 strong points of contact. In spite of the fit, I do not believe this steering wheel lock can be removed in a reasonable amount of time with sheet metal cutters and/or bolt cutters. The visual deterrence along with the theft insurance (up to $5,000 towards your comprehensive deductable) should warrant the expense. I consider it a secondary defense against car theft.If it was 1"" smaller (to better fit my 15"" steering wheel), I'd give it 5 stars!It matches my car, so I've decided to keep it."
2,Sound quality,"I have seen this movie numerous times on Netflix in the past. I loved it every single time. The music is great! The experience just was not the same watching this DVD. The sound quality is not good enough. It like I'm missing half the movies, by not being able the hear the music very well in the back ground. Very disappointed."
2,Failed to dig under the surface,"I am an avid true crime reader. I was somewhat dissappointed in this book.The crime itself was a tragic case of a man who appeared to be ""Mr Nice Guy"" who strangles his young wife. We never get to really know Stefanie in any way, she is potrayed almost as a faceless victim. The book is predominatley about the police investigation and although that is intresting ,it never potrays all dimensions of this case. I feel as though I was simply reading a newspaper article in it's potrayal.The author needed to dig deeper."
3,none,"I do not like that the book keepspopping up on my kindle when i am done, if i choose not to rate, it is my choice. Please stop having a 99% done on my book when it really is done......."
5,Everybody's Best Friend,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I love to read true stories and like to know that the person who committed the crime paid their dues.I also try to figure out why a person would do such a crime. What makes that person ""tick"", what makes them do certain things. While reading this book I also happened across a program on tv that was about this particular story which made it all the more interesting."
2,not enough sources,"...this could have been a very interesting book if all the characters involved had been thoroughly interviewed. Perhaps that wasn't possible. As it is, it is obvious that most all of the material comes from the prosecution team. The last third of the book is nothing but the back and forth of the lawyers. I am much more interested in the friends, family, and the perpetrator which you'll only know by his actions....little about his life or personality. Not a Kathryn Casey or Ann Rule."
5,Good book to read and good writing,I live in PA and am familiar with Philly. It was an interesting book to read and you just have to wonder what the heck gets into people's minds!A good read for a true crime reader.
2,"well written, but disappointing","I think the author is a good writer. What was disappointing to me was that I would have liked follow-up on the friends that were betrayed. More detail about them. Also, there was barely any mention of his childhood or his family. Just all this repetitive detail about the prosecution's case.What was really blatant false adversting, was the bold words ""EIGHT PAGES OF HAUNTING PHOTOS"". There was one picture of the victim holding her baby and one picture of the accused holding the baby. Six other photos were of detectives and lawyers. How brazen! Kinda follows that it was a cheap, made for profit book."
4,A Marriage gone terribly wrong!,"I have to say that I'm not Jewish but I read the book because I like reading true crime stories. Reading this book, I felt bad for the murder victim because she just wanted to be a good Jewish wife and mother. She was smart and married a man who would end her short life. Craig Rabinowitz was not the man who she married. His truth surfaced when he killed her not to mention his double life. I wonder if his family pressured him to marry a nice Jewish girl like his wife. They had a beautiful baby now raised by the grandparents. We don't expect these crimes to happen in an affluent suburb of Philadelphia but it does. There are some victims that get attention at all when it's urban or poor. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised at all."
3,Published too soon...,"This book was just another example of people who try to make money by publishing books too soon after the crimes take place and have little more to offer other than what the public has already read about in the papers. With that said, it is an interesting story though. Like a couple of other reviewers here, I would have also liked to have been able to find out more about his circle of loyal friends and what they are feeling and thinking now. And I also have to agree with others here who have said that the ""haunting photos"" were anything but.I enjoyed this story. The books that come out of this crime library are generally good, but don't go into a whole lot of detail, as other writers may do. I think I would have been interested in reading more about this killers backgound,which some writer in the future may tackle."
2,B O R I N G,This book was nothing more then a story about an overweight loudmouth and pathetic fool who lusted after a stripper and killed the loving mother of his child. There was nothing deep about this book. No indept interviews with childhood friends and family. Nothing to tell us what made this idiot tick.
5,A movie that will touch your heart and spirit!,This movie is a must see for any Touched By An Angel fan or any Christian who beleives in standing up for what they beleive in! My favortive scene is when Jean is thrown into prison and locked in a room with other prisoners who are ordered to beat her to death. No matter how hard the others try to beat her she was protected by Monica taking the blows for her. From that scene it really reminds me of the Scripture talking about laying down your life for a friend. I always cry whenever I watch it in my dorm and I am sure it will touch your heart as well!Amanda Taylor Cornerstone College
2,Item not as described.,"Item wasn't as described. They said I could ship it back, but not worth it for what I paid for it. People should be truthful when asked about a product!"
5,Fab Book,"This book is one of my favourite books that I have read, it is such an amazing book I would recommend this book to everyone and trust me you wont be disappointed, I read this book in 2 days and was sad because it was finished so i quickly went and bought the second part of this book which was Promise to Nadia which was great aswell. I am impatiently waiting for the next book by the same author. after you have read this you will think how lucky you are compared to other woman in this world!!! The author was great aswell as zana who this book is about, Buy it asap!!!"
5,SAD,"It took a long time for me to recieve this book after I ordered it from Amazon.I started to read this book and couldnt put it down.Zana Muhsen is awesome and fierce. She neve once backed down. She's a fighter.I read online that Nadia and her kids are back in the UK (as of 2004). She is (of course)accommipenied by her abusive husband. Hopefully things work out for the entire family.I read a promise to Nadia shortly after finshing SOLD. Its so sad to see how many people took advantage ofZana and her mother. Con-men saw how much money Zana had made with the publication of SOLD, leaching ontothese fragile women till they sucked the blood out of both Zana and Miriam.I am now reading Without Mercy by Zana's mother Miriam......"
5,was very pleased,order came in a timely manner. book was exactly as described. it was very interesting.
2,So much wasted promise,"I bought this book because the back cover description sounded interesting. This book has so much promise to be a wonderful read, but it failed. It seemed tedious and poorly written. A paragraph or maybe two would suffice for the description of carrying water from the well, but not a few pages. This book was also not written for adult readers. The language and tone is very much jr. High."
5,The Best Value,"I use these sanding discs on a hand grinder with a polishing cloth backing. The manufactures' description states, ""Sanding dust pick up not included."" This means that the four slits cut around the hole are not there. This is perfect for me since I found that the sanding disc eventually fails because of the slits.Sometimes, I cut the circumference down to four inches or less (in stead of buying smaller discs) for tighter spots.A must for any woodworking shop or garage and easy to purchase on amazon.com."
4,SWEET REVENGE.....,"First Jack waited to get his revenge on the one person he loved, Alice, through salvage lust. In Jack's bitterness of spirit, he swore that if he ever had an opportunity to get hold of her, He would make her voluptuous person recompense him for his disappointment, and that he would snatch from her by force the bridegroom's privileges that he so ardently coveted.Not only is Jack successful in carrying out his vow, but also he enlists Alice to be his accomplice in entrapping, gently but sadistically torturing, and converting into bisexuality additional conquests. After Alice comes Alice's reluctant maid, Fanny. Then there's the widow, Mrs. Blunt. Finally, the three female converts join Jack in having his/their way with the despicable widow, Lady Betty Bashe, and her eighteen year old daughter, Molly and then he is a partner with a woman who helps fathers of young ladies who want these girls to be submissive to them."
5,DARKEST HOUR???????????????,"thats funny, this cd is great metal.darkest hour sounds like slayer on crack- all mixed up and no bass line. its like they bang on there instruments and yell after inhaleing heleum..."
2,BE REAL MUSICIANS!,"Have a few chord changes in there! For crying out loud, I could play better than these guys on regular guitar, and don't even get me started on how badly I could outplay them on bass! They are nice and heavy though, so I can give them one star, and they do honestly have a FEW chord changes in there, adding one more, but that's about it for positives. I just can't recommend it to true metalcore fans. Pick up the new Darkest Hour or the latest from the Haunted."
3,"Decent, but HARDLY the heaviest album of 2004","I've heard critics call this the ""heaviest album of 2004"". That's a blesphemy. If that's true, then Rob haford isn't gay. What i'm trying to say is simply that there are simply more talented and heavier acts than Full Blown Chaos. For the heaviest record of 2004, go buy ""Souls To Deny"" by Suffocation; they make FBC seem like nsync. With that being said, I will go onto the album. Seeing the three-star review, this is a decent album, but to be honest, i'm not a purist or anthing but, i'm beginning to get tired of the metalcore subgenre. Why, you ask? Because it nowadays has no originality: the same breakdowns, the same riffs, the same vocals, it's just all starting to sound the same. If you like metalcore/hardcore liek slayer_dude, you'll love this. But, just like cotton_hell, i'm just warning you that FBC offer nothing new."
1,Can you say FULL BLOWN CRAP!,"full blown chaos are a horrible band AT BEST. The lead singer has no range at all and every song sounds like the previous, these guys are Hatebreed wannabes. If you want a real metal cd get Darkest Hours new one ""undoing ruin"", it is so much better than this garbage. GOOD JOB FULL BLOWN MONOTONE!"
5,Gorgeous Marquise for such a low price!,"Exactly what I was hoping for. The Cubic Zirconia is sparkly and the perfect size. Fits accurately and the color is perfect Sterling Silver. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the band, which got marked up a little somehow, either in warehouse or during transit, but luckily it's not enough to make me fuss, plus for the price, if need be I could replace it at some point rather than return it for shipping costs that are pricier."
1,"This book is by Dummies, not for them!","I was highly disappointed by the quality of this book. This book is so full of bugs it should only be used for kindling (you might get your money's worth). Previously, I had wonderful experiences with 'Dummies' books, but this one is awful. I tested many of the examples and was forced to edit many of them for the programs to work properly. Also, many of the figures and screenshots are out of place -- or their captions are irelevant to them. One other complaint -- a big one -- I don't know if this happened to all of the CDs, but mine didn't have close to everything that the book advertises! Speak of aggravating! The book will sometimes refer to an example that is on the CD, but when you look for it, it's simply not there. Oh, by the way, I only gave this book a star because I was unable to submit the review otherwise!"
1,This book couldn't be worse,"This book is terrible. I picked it up on sale for at a local computer store, but it wasn't even worth that price. This book is like a cockroach infestation; the number of bugs is unbearable. Examples don't appear in the right places, and they appear with the wrong headings, as do screenshots, etc... I'm not sure whoever proofread this one before it went out, but they should be fired. Do yourself a huge favor and buy another Tcl/Tk... this one is best avoided."
2,don't even bother with this book,"if provides a VERY general overview on creating a few buttons and using wish... Thats it. It can be used to show someone what tcl can do. ...In general, the technical books that are ""For Dummies"" ...[are no good].If your a programmer (or hope to write widgets in tcl/tk) get a different book."
5,Differentiation of cultures within cultures,"I found an amazing bit of information and an entirely new way of thinking about minorities and cultures in our society. Valadez provides a valid distinction between types of groups, such as the Accomodationist groups which seek to integrate themselves into society, the Autonomous groups who wish to remain separate in culture and yet still be part of society and then the Sessestionist groups who wish to be separate in every way including governing their own societies and being in their own separate states. This new information makes it difficult to judge minority groups in the same way, which is a good thing because when it comes to multiculturalism, one size should not fit all."
4,"Excellent follow up to Blessing, Mike Howe is amazing.",This is finally avalaible as an mp3. Thank you epic records even if it did take forever!!!! This is an underated album for the ages. It came out at the worst possible time 1991 the year of GRUNGE. Sigh!!!!! Do yourself a favor and get this album METAL CHURCH fans!!!!
4,Metal church I like it!,Great disc. Nothing else needs to be said. Been looking for it a long time I'm glad I finally found it
4,The Best Herb Book I've Ever Read!,"If you're in need of a great book on herbs, this is the book for you. Although I have never had the pleasure of visiting The Herbfarm, the cookbook has allowed me to transform my kitchen into my own personal herb palace! I never knew herbing could be this fun!"
5,Best Cookbook Ever!,"This is literally the best cookbook I have ever owned. Most cookbooks, there are a few good recipes, and many many unusable recipes. Every recipe in this book that I've made (about 25 so far...) has been FANTASTIC. The dishes are elegant and delicious, without being overly complicated. Buy this cookbook. You won't be sorry!"
2,Mediocre,"I think that Last Resort can be quite happily labelled ""Mediocre"". Unimaginative lyrics, uninspiring music. OK if you want a sampler of Oi! or enjoy music full of violence and ennui, but what they offer can be found much better elsewhere in the Captain Oi! catalogue. Yup, ""Last Resort"" is what they ought to be, at least the name fits."
1,it sucks!!,"This item is ramped up to be so awesome!! However, this can't even steam in a curl that will last longer than 10 seconds, take the roller out and instantly...flat hair!! Very disapointing!"
1,Can not use it,It was very difficult to use the lock. It would not open even when I type the right combination. Took 2 or 3 try.
4,Fair enough~,"Not that expensive, and really easy to use, though I am not sure whether it can keep working for a long time, but so far it is good enough."
4,a good purchase,I have been using it almost daily for over two weeks. Seen no problem. Definitely a good purchase considering the price your pay for it.
1,Avoid non-U.S. Master combination locks.,"Why is it that a Master no longer stamps: ""Made in U.S.A. (Milwaukee)"" on their locks as they did for decades? Why is it that neither the lock nor even the initial lock packaging also doesn't state where it's made? Is there a reason for this? Don't they care to disclose something maybe their not too proud of? I threw out my -brand new- Master combination lock because it would take me anywhere from 4 to 6 attempts to get it to unshackle. Garbage. And new. I'm not sure if it was Benjamin Franklin that said something like ""If you can't say something good about someone (something), then don't say anyhting at all."" Sorry, but it's the truth."
1,Master Lock should stop making these,"Don't use this lock to secure anything that is valuable, because it's so easy to shim open. Petty thieves can open this in 2 seconds flat, without even looking suspicious.See how easy it is here: youtube.com/watch?v=1eGxRQlWTrMI learned the hard way. I wish I saw this video before I used this product and it failed me."
1,caution,"please be aware that there are numerous newsgroup threads ... which explain how to pick this lock in less than 10 minutes with no experience.Sadly, I learned this the hard way."
1,Failed badly- disabled in seconds or minutes?,"Had one of these on my locker at the gym during close to peak hours. Came back after an hour's exercise and not only was my lock and bag gone from my locker, but 3 other people had had their locks disabled. This lock didn't even slow down the thief(thieves). Spend a little more money in an attempt to get thieves to leave your stuff alone."
2,Bought 2 locks - one won't open,"While MasterLock has been a solid brandname in our household, we were a bit dissapointed with this purchase. We bought 2 combination locks for our daughter to use on her lockers at school. They came with their combinations typed on a piece of paper. One lock code was almost unreadable and it took several tries to ""guess"" what the last digit was. It was a toss-up between a 3, a 6, and an 8.The 2nd lock combination was printed much clearer and there was little confusion as to what the code was... however, it will not open.While we saved some money by purchasing these online - I feel we spent more than a store would have charged as only one lock will open."
3,"Fine for Everyday Use, Not Secure","While this lock may be okay for everyday use that you'd simply like to discourage people from breaking into (school lockers, gym lockers) it's amazingly easy to crack. It would only take an amateur 5-10 minutes to open one of these."
2,Not very impressive,"The build quality doesn't seem very good. The parts shake and it needs a little tugging to get the lock open after rotating to the correct combo. I'm using it to secure a school locker, so the contents aren't too important. I'm only hoping that it lasts and doesn't get jammed."
1,Waste of money...,I just got main in my mail. I can even unlock it cause is so loose. It is not worth to return it since shipping cost will extend it actual price.
4,I had this in Jr High,As a kid many people knew that it was easy to open theese lock by just shaking the fat part of the lock. So when you lock something you will have to shake the lock alot till it stops opening. Then you have to twist the dial pad. But I guess it is what you get for your money.
2,Would not recommend...,"Yes, this is a very common lock that looks really nice; however, there are some disadvantages since it is so common. The main reason why I don't recommend this to anyone is because of the ease to open it. A thief can literally open this lock in less than 5 seconds. That is really bad if you are trying to protect something valuable. Overall since this is a really easy to get robbed lock I wouldn't buy it and masterlock should really think about discontinuing these types of locks. I rate this product 2 stars out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!"
2,Works I Guess...,"When I first received it, I turned the 3 numbers given and it popped open but then I noticed that is was extremely hard to push back in to lock it... needed to put excess amount of pressure to close the lock. If I were to use it in public it would be me look slightly dimwitted... Would return it but too much work for that guess you shouldn't expect much from something this cheap. I would recommend you buy something else if you want something functioning normally."
5,Not Bad for the Price but 1590D is better,"I have used this type lock 1500D for years. I also found the youtube video for shimming this lock open. When you search anti-shim on youtube you will find the 1590D and 1500iD.Then I bought the 1590D and it has set your own combo and it is anti-shim! Cost a little more money but you get what you pay for as they say. More security, set your own combo for faster dialing / opening. Worth the $$!!"
4,It does its job,"I know this isn't one of those fancy locks that are super secure, but for me it does the job! For the price I paid, as long as it keeps my items locked, I'm happy with it."
5,Awsome stuff,this stuff is awsome. I use my hands all the time and my feet in steal toed shoes all day and even I dont like how dry they get. Got this and the hand cream and it is great. recommend for the rest of your life!!!
4,Works Great,My feet have been feeling much better ever since I have been using this. I recommend this for anyone that has dry cracking feet.
5,Truly Amazing!!!,"I have suffered from cracked heels for as long as I can remember. My feet were always dry and heels had white crack lines that no amount of scrubbing or Fancy creams would get rid off. I have spent quite a bit of money on high end foot creams that did nada..O'Keeffe's foot cream is truly amazing. I just applied a very thin layer on my heels every night and whithin a couple of days I saw huge improvements. Now after almost 2 weeks, my feet resembles that of a baby :)Love the product."
5,Works really well,I had two scratch like marks on my hand from winter dryness ... this took care of it in just a couple days. Everybody uses this stuff when they come over. My husband had cracks on his thumbs from being dry ... he used this for a day or two and it healed the cracks. Love this stuff!
2,Doesn't work for me,"I've been using it every night (really every night)following the instruction (wearing stockings to sleep)for one whole month to tackle my heel problem (very dry and with crack). However, the improvement is miminal, say around 5%. My heel problem has been there for almost 18 years; not sure it's been too difficult to cure. The O'Keefe's is not cheap (including shipping cost, and comparing with similar product available at drug stores); I do expect more from it."
3,O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet cream 3.2 oz jar,O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet cream 3.2 oz jar. My husband used this and he said it helped his feet somewhat but not completely. He said it was OK.
2,Disappointed,"It is true that this formula is non-slippery, as reviewers have said. However, I can't say it works any better than my other moisturizers. I used it for a few weeks, sometimes twice a day, and I can't say I had the kind of results that other reviewers seem to claim. I'm still looking for a good heel cream."
1,Won't buy this again,"I ordered this product based on the other reviewers statements, which is what I usually do when ordering online. This product felt weird and grainy when applied to my feet. After letting it absorb into my skin, which took about five minutes, my feet felt clammy and gunky. I thought I had used too much product but nothing rubbed off. Later that day, I took off my sandals and checked my feet. They felt sticky. I tried this again the next day and wore socks and tennis shoes. After awhile, I couldn't stand how my feet felt inside the shoes and socks. Luckily I was home, took off the socks and shoes and bathed my feet with soap and water. Afterwards I used plain old body lotion on my feet, which felt great. I don't like this product and regret that I got it."
1,Doesn't deliver as promised,"I used this twice a day, everyday, for 3 weeks. I even wore socks at night (and during the day), my feet are not one bit better than when I started using it. No improvement at all."
5,Best foot cream on the market!,"I had purchased the working hands cream first and it worked so well even on my feet, thats when I decided to try the Healthy feet. Best on the market!!"
2,Wanted to like it based on the other reviews,"Sorry to say that I didn't really like it; though I'm glad that it works for others. What I noted was that it wasn't particularly better than other products I've tried (I'm always looking for a better mousetrap), but it leaves a sticky, waxy feeling on the skin. I don't like to sleep with socks on, and I found that while using this, my feet stuck to the sheets, so that I couldn't move around. Better luck to others!"
3,Cracked Feet,"The product is okay. It appears to sit on the surface of the skin rather than absorb. A couple of hours later, the skin is dry, cracked and not feeling supple."
2,Not sure what people are thinking?,"I got this product because of the overall good reviews. My skin even isn't as bad as some have described theirs to be so I thought it would definitely work. But of course, over 3 weeks now using it every day as instructed and nothing has changed much. It may be slightly better but basically nothing has changed. Also, the image shows ""Working"" feet but the product name being sold is ""Healthy"" feet. Not sure if these are actually different. Will not be buying again."
5,THERE IS NO PRODUCT BETTER THAN WORKING HANDS,"I am blessed with very dry and sensitive skin that is especially problematic in the winter months. I've tried all kinds of products to help with my dry cracked hands but everything makes me break out in a rash....except Working Hands hand creme. This stuff has given me a new lease on life! The only problem is that it is not available everywhere. I moved last year and was unable to find it in my new hometown for more than a year. Fortunately, I recently stumbled upon it at my local LOWE'S (in the paint solvent sections???); I bought them out. Life is good and my hands look and feel great again!"
5,Finally- a solution that works,"I can't say enough about this product. Every winter my skin on my knuckles and elbows would get chapped and cracked. For years I tried various lotions and creams, some of which caused a burning discomfort. O'keefes is the best product for this. It goes on easy, soaks in quickly with no messy residue, and actually works. I am so satisfied!"
3,"OK, but not what I expected","I have dry feet and have used a ton of products; usually I return to Udderly Smooth. I tried this out, but the consistency is a little tough, not creamy, and it just didn't work as well. Once it runs out I will be going back to Udderly Smooth."
2,Pass this up,"I did a test between O'Keeffe's cream and Flexitol for a week, and Flexitol won. I walked around barefoot for a week and put the cream on right before bed. By next morning, my heel with Flexitol was completely healed and healthy looking. The heel with the O'K'eeffe's was not. There was an improvement, but only slight. Overall, it's okay and it does work, which is why I gave it 2 stars. So if you use this, be patient because you'll be waiting several days before you see full results. Also be aware that it looks/feels like Crisco."
4,Working Feet and Working Hands are the exact same product,"Just a heads up folks, I realized the other day when I purchased BOTH O'Keeffe's Working Hands and Working Feet that they are the exact same product. I believe that is false advertising, so correct me if I'm wrong. I'll use both of them, it is Chicago after all and the winters are unforgiving to the hands and feet, but I just wanted to let other unsuspecting consumers know the ingredients and product info read exactly the same. I hate it when I'm duped. Still a great product though."
3,Very sticky,I am not sure if this product works really well for moisturing just because i can't get myself to use it often enough. I like to moisturize my feet prior to going to bed.. but this moisturizer is so greas and sticky that i can't sleep if i lather it on! The mornign after - your feet will still be very very well moisturized.. maybe a little too well. Perhaps this cream is for extreme cases only...
4,Happy Feet,I didn't think that I was going to like this but I do. It keeps my feet feeling great all day. I have used it everyday since I got it and I love it. I will be getting more of this product soon. I like this so much I am going to try the one for your hands.
3,It's OK,This cream brings fair healing. It is however difficult to use as it is not exactly a cream. It has a hard surface making it more difficult to apply.
5,Nothing else like this out there...,My heals get very dry and I have tried numerous products with limited success. This product takes the cake. Within 3 days...seriously 3 days...my feet were softer. I don't know what they use but I can the urge to stockpile it in case they change the recipe. Great product.
4,Healthy Feet,Works very well to keep your feet from drying out and cracking. I would recommend to my friends to try it.
4,FINALLY RELIEF,I GIVE IT A 4 STAR FEELS GOOD ON MY FEET.COOL FEET BECAREFULL LITTLE SLIPERY FOR A WHILE.I WOULD RECOMMENT THIS PRODUCT
5,Soft as a baby's bottom,"I'm kind of shocked that there are any negative reviews on this cream. I have literally looked all over the freaking place for something to help my jacked up feet, which were so deeply cracked on the heels and in the creases of my toes I could barely walk. I stumbled on O'Keefes at Bed Bath and Beyond by accident. In a week of using O'Keefes the cracks were nearly healed. Two weeks and they look baby smooth and pink, except for one exceptionally deep crack I've had for years. But I predict that will probably be gone too in a couple more weeks. Can't wait for sandal weather for once!!!As far as the negative reviews go, I do agree it has a weird sticky feeling to it, but I put it on in the morning and throw on cotton socks. Works perfectly. I can't imagine that a person with average dry feet wouldn't see results in a couple weeks MAX."
1,crisco?,I've been looking for a cheaper alternative to Nordic Care....I bought this based on the reviews. This has the consistency of crisco (not the oil.. the white kind...it called lard?). It did nothing for my cracked heels is very oily and a waste of my money.
2,Not So Great,I have tried much better foot cream. I am not too impressed with this product. I like the Bliss products much better. I would not recommend this product.
2,greasy cream,I recieved product as stated and on time. I just don't think the cream lives up to the hype! I am thinking of sending it back as it is guaranteed
5,Working feet cream,This is a good product I have used it before my feet can be dried up so bad the skin is flaking after a treatment with this cream they are soft with very little dryness .I recommend this product to anyone who suffers with dry cracked feet it works Well
3,"Feels odd, but works","This stuff really does work to help heal cracked and chapped working hands. It left a weird residue feeling that I didn't like, but if the texture doesn't bother you then you'll love this stuff."
4,Good,I used it everyday before i go to bed .Is works my feet very well .My feet get rest after this cream
5,Great stuff!!!,"Best flavor hot sauce on the market. Does NOT taste like tobasco. You can add this to ""heat up"" a bowl of chili and it tastes like it was cooked in."
3,"Acceptable, But Not the Ideal Gift","This gift set is what one would expect for a $16 purchase (shipping included). The bottles are made of cheap and bendy plastic, and the caps are not sealed tight and almost came open when I opened the box. Cheap-looking ""Made in China"" tags are found everywhere and on everything and it's hopeless trying to tear them or conceal them a little. The basket looks presentable only with the items arranged as pictured, but what the photograph does not show is the supporting piece at the bottom - a dusty sponge wrapped in used tapes. If you take it out then there is no way to make the same arrangement. I bought it as a gift for a friend, but now I'll need to find an alternative one.I haven't tried the product itself, so this review pertains only to its appearance as a gift."
5,Great product!,"The items come in this woody box that looks super cute anywhere, and the vanilla scent was awesome. I liked everything about this item."
3,Silky lotion..smell not so pleasant,"This was a gift...it was ok, but it really reminded me of the cheapo baskets you get from WalMart. A nice budget saver, but will not purchase again."
3,Was ok,I wanted to send my friend just a small gift to let her know I was thinking of her. This was perfect for that and it smells great too. For the price and the purpose it was perfect.
1,I was duped,"What a con. The idea of this book was so beguiling that I spent $2.50 only to discover that after I was hooked into reading a very interesting idea, found it was full of sugary Christian quotes and parables. Good grief,if I wanted to read biblical lessons I would read the bible. Great literature it is not. Naive drivel it is. Pity, because the concept was good."
1,Seek out another time travel book.,"The idea of the book had potential, but fails on two counts. First, the technology of how the time travel works, was not well developed or described. This is especially the case as it relates to the travelers staying in the past. The author did not explain how the travelers (if dead in the present) could actually live in the past.Second, to me, the book was offensively preachy. For example, while reading the book, it seemed that the author went out of her way to sermonize about Jesus rather than to write a quality science fiction/time travel book. Based upon my reaction to the Time Lottery, I would not read this author again or another promisepress book, for that matter."
3,Valterra Twist-On Waste Valve,Can't say whether this item works well or not. Don't care for it. Hasn't helped with emptying the black water in the RV so don't really understand what it is supposed to do.
3,no pun intended,"This is a documentary. not a film of stand up comedy. it gives you a true perspective of the craft of comedy.How it is on the road, how the industry treats you and the struggle to make a name for yourself."
5,Oldie but a goodie.,Good fun read that gets harder. Straightforward pedagogy of the mid 20th century that works. Unlike some of the stuff we do today.
5,Couldn't put it down,"I would read this book in the evening, and I couldn't wait to begin where I had left off the previous day. The book is detailed and totally inspiring. God's presence and power are demonstrated throughout the book. It is a favorite book in my library."
5,Fabulous!,"This was a great experience and I hope I have the pleasure to purchase from this seller again. The book is a treasured one for me and I love reading it. It seems to me that Billy Graham is ""speaking"" the words instead of me reading them. The seller was honest and above reproach. Packaged beautifully and on time. I can't thank them enough!"
5,This book is outstanding reading.,"Billy Graham's autobiography is a very down-to-earth and warm read. Dr. Graham has probably shared the message of the Gospel with more people than anyone else who has lived. With simple clarity, he shares his life and the love of his life--the Gospel of Jesus Christ. His autobiography is exciting, challenging, and edifying. After reading it, I was struck with how selfless he has been in such a selfish world. He is truly God's man for this century"
5,Must Read,"This book is inspiring, and insightful. The life story of the most influential man in history. Even if you don't share the same beleifs as Billy Graham, read the book."
4,triple check description,"I ordered this book as a gift for a family member and wanted a new book. The book I received looked used and not new. This seller was generous and refunded my order. If someone just wants to read the book, this is a good deal and the seller provided excellent customer service. I would next time read all the details very carefully as when I ordered it, I did not see that the description mentioned the cover was not in perfect order until after I received the book. I rate this product as four stars for good customer service and accurate delivery time. Just triple check the description before buying."
5,No one wants to miss out on this one!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Graham does a tremendous job of telling his story. He not only tells it in a creative way, but also a fun and humorous way. At times you laugh, and at times you cry because he brings you right into the scene. Anyone that is looking for an example to follow when writing an autobiography need not look any further."
5,Entertaining and helpful,"This book details the life of Mr. Graham from a just a boy until a senior citizen. Great stories of encouragement throughout and many stories showing the grace and mercy of a loving God through Mr. Graham.It's long, but hard to put down. I find myself reading slowly as if Mr. Graham were reading it aloud in his smooth southern accent. I learned a lot about the man and his convictions."
5,The Life Story of the 20th Century's Greatest Evangelist,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I always have respected Billy Graham and admired his work, but now I have been provided insight into his heart and soul. Beginning with his childhood, Graham describes how God worked in his life to take him to international prominence as an evangelist. He is undoubtedly the greatest evangelist of the 20th century, and the events described in this book are nothing short of miraculous. Many of us grew up with Billy Graham, and may have simply taken his ministry for granted. Here in this volume however, we see how God was moving powerfully through a humble, single-minded Baptist preacher to shake the world for Christ. If you have a heart for evangelism, you won't want to miss this book. If you don't have a heart for evangelism, then reading this book may very well change your priorities. This title already is quickly becoming a classic."
4,Excellent documentary on the life of a great man of God..,"I was required to read this book for a Theo of Ministry course in the Spring 2003 semester. At first it seemed a bore, but in time the benefits of reading about Bill Graham paid off. God has worked in Billys life in supernatural ways so many times, and his life is a testimony of that very fact!I rather enjoyed the book and rather enjoyed attending the SFBay Area Billy Graham crusade in 1997. It will probably be the last crusade I ever attend with Billy, but it was well worth it, as well as this powerful read. My only gripe is the size of this book."
5,It Is An U.S. History,"The part interested me most is the relationship between Billy Graham and the presidents of the United States from Dwight Eisenhower to Bill Clinton, which takes one third of the book and covers half of the century of the U.S. history. He talked their charactors and family lives. Only Billy Graham has this kind of experience. You will learn those presidents from a different angle, a Christian leader's point of view. It is a very unique book. Regarding Christianality, if you do not have time to read the whole book of 735 pages, you can read the last chapter, chapter 40: The Best is Yet to Be, which concludes his faith and philosophy. It touched me that someone asked him if he thought God was unfair, allowing him to have Parkinson's disease. He answered: ""Suffering is part of the human condition, and it comes to us all. The key is how we react to it, either turning away from God in anger and bitterness or growing closer to Him in trust and confidence."""
4,Long but worthwhile,"This book is very lengthy, though not surprising since Dr. Graham has experienced some 60 years of ministry. I found it to be extremely detailed which in turn made it at times feel lengthier than it really is. He seems to have left no stones unturned as far as time frames, activities, and interaction with countries and well-known personalities are concerned. I especially appreciated Part Seven in which he gives credit to his co-workers and family for their contributions to his ministry. In particular, Chapter 39 is especially poignant as he reiterates what he might have done differently in his personal and professional lives. It is most interesting for anyone who has a fascination for a person and ministry of this magnitude."
3,Life of the greatest evangelist since St. Paul,"Unless Billy did a fantastic job in hiding all of the difficult and trying times of his life (as I suspect in the case of his troubled relationship with his son Franklin), WHAT A LIFE this man had!!! Who would not want to have what he had: travels; meetings with the rich, the famous, the wise; success; financial stability; a loving wife; great kids; and most of all, the honor and privilege to lead millions to Christ. Can you imagine the party they'll throw in heaven when he gets there? However, the book was very mediocre in my view. Very seldom the author opened his heart and expressed his true feelings...Lots of anecdotes, details, insignificant (to the reader) stuff; it was not a total waste of time, because you always get the feeling that this man loves his Lord and truly wants to serve Him. Not much to say against that...I just wish he could have made deeper remarks about people and events in general."
5,Just As I Am... A humble title for a humble man,"Billy Graham's latest book offers a fresh and personal insight to his life and his life's work. It is truly amazing how God has worked in this wonderful and dedicated man's long life. Yet, he continues to wonder ""why""? Why would God take a young man from Charlotte, NC and transform him into the greatest evangelist since Paul? Most interesting is his relationship with his wife, his family, those he worked and works with, presidents and leaders throughout the world. It is facinating to read of his burden of countries closed off from outsiders, yet, in time, God opened the door to Billy Graham to spread the Gospel in those same countries. In this day of dishonest and insincere TV evangelists, it is refreshing to read of one so intent on giving God alone the glory. At seventy-eight he admits that he will not be here much longer. I will miss him even more now having read his book. May we all follow his example"
5,God's grace at work through a humble man,"""Just as I am"" reveals the grace of God, illustrated by the life of Billy Graham. Graham is refreshingly honest and humble about his life's purpose and God's will. His life is evidence of what a human is capable of if he/she lets God take control.It's an amazing testimony of one man's journey from a humble farm boy to an international preacher. As a political science nut I was fascinated by his interactions with so many US Presidents. Billy Graham has truly influenced the path of our nation, and therefore, the world.Yet this book is careful to point out that his success is not due to Billy Graham, but God working through Graham's life. Everyone who reads this book must consider the ""Hour of Decision."" Billy Graham's testimony demands that apathy is not a choice in the decision regarding eternity."
5,nana gives it 2 thumbs up!!,billy graham is in fine form. very entertaining and informative. and you can take what nana tells you to the bank
1,Horrible DVD,There is not one reason to purchase this DVD. Neither kids or adults will enjoy it. I was hoping for something along the lines of America's Funniest Home Videos (WITHOUT Bob Saget) but it did not even live up to that weak standard. A total disappointment. Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy watching overweight folks perform pig calls at a county fair. That is the type of material (I kid you not) that is on this DVD. I only hope I can get rid of it on eBay so I don't have to look at it in my DVD collection.
4,Cute for the price,"Like other reviewers, the ring I received was also set with 4 prongs instead of 6, and is set slightly crooked - but no one else will notice! I wear a standard ring size 7, but this ring in a size 7 was a bit loose for me, so I wear it on my middle finger instead of my ring finger (which in retrospect is probably a good thing, because even on my middle finger I've had people think that it's a wedding ring)."
3,retromommy,"Love the heart ring. It looks very elegant. No one can tell its a fake..sshhh.. and everyone asks "" when are you getting married?"" The silver keeps its shine. The stone needs to be polished up and cleaned in the back once in awhile. BUT its beautiful. I have my eye on the pink heart ring."
5,Love it,I love this ring and I hope my daughter does to.if not i will keep for my self.i love the ring
2,i wanted to love this,i recieved the ring today just now actually and i noticed it is a for prong ring not six and the stone is loose i hope i can get it fixed i really want to where this ring. the reason the stone is loose is because the prong is bent if i can straighten it out i might be able to where it. dissapointed
4,"Excellent for the price, but the size is wrong","I bought this cheap ring ($14 included shipping) to try jewelry on amazon, and worked perfect. My wife has this ring for over 3 years and it still shines like new. The Zirconia is a bit scratched, but for the price is excellent. Just be careful with the size, according to the chart my wife was 10, but when she got the ring it was too big, she is a 9. It is better to go to a jeweler to get the size."
4,Excellent ring for price!,I got this ring for christmas for my 14 year old daughter and she loved it. I thank you and would purchase from you again...
5,great ring,It was great ring. i was not expecting that good ring in that price. It is great ring with clear stone. i would recommend that to every one. It can be really good friendship ring or you can give it to your girlfriends if you cannot afford fancy and expensive diamonds. Also seller is great we can trust them. Shipment was on time and in great condition.
2,Disappointed...,"The ring is cute, but clearly not very high quality...also the heart stone is slightly crooked which was just distracting enough to make me not want to wear the ring. If I were able to go back and re-buy this ring, unfortunately I would probably spend my money on something else."
1,"Beautiful ring, poor creation","This is a beautiful ring. I wore it for 5 days & got lots of compliments. However, on the 5th day I looked down & the cubic zirconia stone was missing. I wondered, after I got it, if I should have had it tightened. I didn't and now I have a silver band missing the stone."
4,Beautiful!,"The picture does not do the ring justice. It is much more beautiful in person. The only potential problem I see is that the band of the ring is somewhat thin. It might bend in the future, but I can't be sure. (Note: The ring I ordered is a size 10, so that might affect the thinness of the band). But I love this ring - it is absolutely beautiful!"
2,NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE,"so it shines a little but so many imperfections the metal band is cheap disformed and tarnished within an hour of wearing it, i think simply cuz its cheap metal and got wet. the heart doesnt look allot like a heart untill you get close up. cute if its gunna be a play ring or for a yooung teen. as far as wearing this thing im ashamed :("
3,"Prongs dissapointing, band small","The band width appears smaller in real life than the picture, and the stone only has 4 prongs not the six pictured. Fit is good and stone is nice and sparkly, it just doesn't look like the picture."
4,Very surprised!,"I purchased this ring as a travel ring, and I must say, I absolutely love this ring. It doesn't look or feel fake, and actually sparkles almost like a real diamond under the light. I received a four-prong ring, instead of the six prong shown in the picture, but that is hardly an issue to me, the ring is gorgeous.The only problem I had with this ring is that there were bits and pieces of fluffy material, sort of like tissue paper wedged under the prongs. It's not obvious, but on closer inspection, it's definitely there.I'm so pleased with this ring that I've went and purchased one in pink and aquamarine as well!"
3,You get what you pay for,This ring isnt very durable. The gem feels loose and the metal isnt very solid. It looks good but the quality isnt there. Great for a highschooler or a cheap promise ring. My girlfriend liked it though. But really its the thought that counts!
1,Horrible product,"I am very unhappy with this product. Not only does the CZ look plastic, it fell out after two days of wearing it. I have never been more disappointed with a piece of jewelry than this one. Do not buy it. The ring itself looks like it came out of a quarter machine. I'm not sure what kind of ring everyone else got to give it such glowing reviews, but mine was definitely nowhere near their descriptions."
1,Agree with SUCKS,"Same exact problem as previous review. If you're not careful, this thing not only slide on backwards, but it will slide so far you can't fit the key. Major design flaw. Don't want to pay for bolt cutters, trying a hacksaw..."
1,SUCKS,I bought this to put on a cabinet and mistakenly put the bottom on backwards. IT LET ME PUT IT ON BACKWARDS. Now I have to buy a bolt cutter to open it.
3,The Band Swings But Nana Falls Flat!,"This review is painful for me to write, because I am a big Nana Mouskouri fan and I have been for many years. Nana Mouskouri sings beautifully in French, Greek and Spanish, but a big band jazz singer she isn't. Old age has finally caught up to her! While the band is solid in this live performance, Nana's voice is ""thin,"" her phrasing is off and at times, her intonation is weak. The crowd is very kind to her in this DVD. Many years ago, she recorded an LP called ""Nana Mouskouri in New York"" with Torrie Zito and Quincy Jones. It has reccently been re-released on CD. This is a much better purchase, if you want something that reflects pop music! Save your money on this one and buy something else from amazon.com."
3,Disappointing DVD debut for Nana,"As a recent discoverer of this wonderful singer....her Spanish recordings are my preference..I was glad to have found a DVD on Nana since, as far as I know, no other DVDs of her exist.The orchestra is wonderful but Ms Mouskouri's performance was a bit disappointing for me. Her voice was a bit thin and weak-sounding (the whole concert is primarily in English)and to make matters worse..on a few of the songs..she is actually reading the lyrics off of a songbook as she sings them....very very distracting and ""off-putting"" to see her do this..kudos though to a very very nice rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW..A treat to see Nana on DVD but the performance was not as good as I thought it would be."
4,British WWII story telling more about women's efforts during the war,"Exceptionally good choice of actors, and thankfully including realistic hard outdoor work while showing typical weather conditions of the country and the limited conveniences in war-time and of the era. I grew up in the 50's and 60's and it was a bit too liberated as compared to where and when I grew up, but then, maybe I wasn't! I liked it in the same way I like Foyle's War episodes. I wanted to see this older production before seeing the current Land Girls series. I will watch it again...."
3,Enjoy the early MSM sound,"Gloria and MSM brought the world to the latin sound and cuban beats and I miss that at times, but know that artists evolve to expand their market...ok songs."
1,Live for Loathing You,"The Cuban hootchie cootchie mama comes back after breaking her back in an accident. I guess we're all supposed to love her for surviving. On the basis of this music, I can't muster up any feeling at all. The main hit from this, ""Live for Loving You"" got tons of radio play, and for no good reason. It is a trite waste of time. Cliched lyrics set to light Latin beats makes for a sour cocktail. The title song isn't much better; it got old after hearing it once, not a good sign. Stick with Miami Sound Machine's Primitive Love album; at least there are a couple of decent tunes on it, namely ""Words Get in the Way"", ""Bad Boy"" and ""Falling In Love""."
4,Glorious Return!,"This was Gloria's come-back album after the accident in her tour bus and every song contains a theme of healing and restoration, showing how one can overcome a serious problem. Coming Out Of The Dark is a gospel-flavoured ballad dealing with the loving support of her husband and her legion of loyal fans. My other favourites are Heart With Your Name On It and Live For Loving You. A very inspring album with great songs, leaving you with a warm glow."
4,one of my favorites,"i had forgotten how yummy these were, buy i had a bag of them the other day and they are GREAT as they always have been. i actually ate so many that my teeth and gums hurt that night (and the little nut pieces can get stuck in your teeth) but the pain was well worth the pleasure of enjoying them."
4,Could've been perfect.,"Maybe if I bought the newer collections, I'd enjoy it more. This is the 1991 recordings of the albums so the songs aren't that good in quality. too bad for me. I didn't know. Anyway, it's still good. My favorites are: ""Can you stop the rain"", ""Lost in the Night"", ""Soul Provider"" and ""Closer than Close""....I just have to adjust the volume controls to better my liking with this CD, to make it okay and more enoyable. I don't have to do this with the other music CDs I have."
3,How to Be A No Limit Person - Wayne Dyer,"Less is not always better, 3 Stars. The original 6 tape version by Nightingale Conant will remain the 5 Star winner. This newer Abridged version leaves out some of Dr. Dyers best counsel and most entertaining passages."
3,How to be a No Limit Person,Was somewhat disappointed in this lecture by Dr. Dyer. I have purchased many of his audio books and have found them positive and inspirational. This one does make some very good points but this was obviously done quite a number of years ago and I found some of his statements extremely negative. Since then Dr. Dyer has developed a much more positive way of getting his points across.
1,Didnt recieve Gohan,"Very disappointed. I ordered Gohan but instead recieved Goku. This was a gift for my boyfriend, and he was very disappointed that it wasn't his favorite character. :/"
2,Good Brand Bad Model,"I buy this safe and 5 units 3 presented problems with merge mechanism; wheels are very hard and hang with use. I do not recommend its use, lament is a known brand and its other products are very good quality."
3,Not that helpful.,I don't speak any Spanish. I have not found this pocket guide to be very helpful. Perhaps I'm a specialist and need something more specific for my specialty.
5,This is how I became a Dave Grusin fan!,"I Loved this movie, and just about wore the vinyl out playing this album so many times! I fell in love with Grusin's compositions and arrangements. Led me to discover his other recordings, and have been a fan ever since. Only wish I could replace this with the CD version. Dave!! If you're reading this, we'd love to buy this again!"
2,Will Shakespeare ain't Shakespeare!,"I tried watching the video Will Shakespeare... whoever wrote the screenplay behind it must've been on 'the good stuff' or something because it appears to be one of those so-called modernistic jumble movies, where one skips from one thing to another, one quick scene to another with only the writer of the screenplay knowing what the relationship is between what happens in one scene and the next. Me... I put it on the shelf and, when I'm feeling I want to watch something that'll completely confuse me sufficient to put me to sleep or make me want to read a good magazine or book, then I'll put it back into the DVD player, turn the sound down, and pay no attention to it. I thought it would be a decent biography of Shakespeare's life. Doesn't seem to be. Sad."
1,Really Bad!,"I have tried watching this movie at least 4 or 5 times. It's a mumble jumble.It skips from one scene to another and makes me believe a part of the plot was omitted. I expected a better telling of Shakespeare's life. Sorry, Tim Curry groupies but this movie is putrid and a waste of money."
3,"Acting good, writing awful","I'm a big Tim Curry fan, so it was nice to watch him in all his youthful gorgeousness. That being said, the writing was cliche', heavy-handed, awkward, and embarrassing. Real people don't talk like that now, and they didn't talk like that back in those days. The acting was as good as it gets when you've got a dog of a script to work with."
3,Not really for use in classroom,"I am a Canadian high school teacher; I bought the dvd because I absolutely love Tim Curry. I thought I could incorporate some of this into my unit on Shakespeare. However, I don't think I'm going to be able to use it. I hope this doesn't sound rude (I still love you, Tim!) but the dialogue moves very quickly and from experience I know that young people sometimes have a hard time understanding British accents. (I've used a couple of Monty Python skits in classes - ""What Have The Romans Ever Done For Us?"" - and most of them have left the students baffled). All in all, this dvd is rich and informative, but its classroom value is a little dubious."
1,Busted,"Yet another game I got from the Sim Mania pack, and whenever I tried to play it, the computer froze."
3,Flimsy,"These are quite a bit lighter and flimsier than the last Range Kleen set I ordered. One of the large covers isn't firm or heavy enough to lay flat over the burner. I just put them on the stove, so time will tell whether or not they'll survive typical stove-top activity."
5,Good burner covers,The covers were exactly what we expected to get. The black color perfectly matches our black stove top. The cover are easy to clean.
3,Not a true fire engine red,"The picture for this product shows a bright ""true"" red, however, the product I received was definitely not that shade. My kitchen is done in black and red, had I known that this was a slightly darker shade of red, I would have gone with the black. However, it is close enough that I did not bother returning them. Just a bit annoying to find out only after receiving them.On the bright side, they are good quality, not too flimsy."
2,Just for decoration,"If for decoration then it is okay, but it got burned within 5 mins when I turned my stove on.. probably i just mis-read some instructions and set too high expectations.."
5,Very Happy,"I am so happy that I found these covers, they completely match the stove top.I do not understand why they do not sell this color in a department store."
3,The covers do the job,"We will be remodeling our kitchen in the next year or so and our current cooktop is very old. My husband doesn't like me to remove the burners very often for cleaning because he is concerned about damaging the aging contacts, so these covers were a compromise. They are thin and not very sturdy, but they will do for now. I really didn't want to pay a lot of money for something that we won't have for long. They are okay for now."
2,Burner covers,"Not to happy with these, the covers are very poor quality they look good but I have to be careful when I clean them not to bend them :("
5,Stove burner covers,"I could not find these almond covers any where, so glad i found them, finally, Not expensive and i am very happy with them."
3,Nice look but...,"Very nice look but almost too thin to be practical. I think I bent one just by looking at it. Seriously, one has already been indented by setting a small pan on it."
2,Expensive and flimsy,"Prior to this purchase, I've bought covers from this company for both our old 24"" electric stove and our newer 30"" gas stove. This set was for the electric stove which has 3 small burners and 1 large one. Usually, I cover one back burner with a tea kettle rather than buy two sets of covers since most manufacturers tend to package these sets as 2 large and 2 small covers. In the past, the quality was far superior to the ones I can buy at a local discount store, but not this time. None of these covers fit their respective electric burners well and all were flimsy. On top of that, the ebony color spotted badly and the edges rusted after a couple of quick washings in the sink. I won't be buying these again."
2,Not substantial,"Product received as advertised and the color and fit are perfect. Having said that, I find the quality of the material used to make these covers pretty flimsy and tinny. Using a higher gauge of metal would have made the quality of this product much better"
3,Black Granite Burner Covers,"With limited shopping options in our city, i often utilize the internet to purchasehard to find items. The stove burner covers weren't a bargin by any means butI was just happy to be able to not only find them online but have lots of color options.When I received my black granite covers, to my surprise they were much more ""blueish"" thanblack and clash badly in my kitchen. I don't know if they just sent the wrong ones or if thisis what they consider black but they are far from black. i should have returned them butit was right before christmas and got busy and ended up keeping them. disappointed......"
3,Burner covers,These burner covers are nice but are no nicer than the ones I can buy for $5.00 in one of the local stores that I will not mention. They are nice but overpriced.
1,Color deceptive,The color shown on the Amazon website turned outt to be very deceptive and not the color of the covers at all. The site shows granite looking gray covers. The covers are actually blue. They immediately went to charity thrift store. Very disappointed in Amazon.
5,Burner Covers good quality and larger enough to cover burners well,Good quality and larger than my enamel covers. I would purchase again. Delivery was as promised. Good value for the price.
5,Hubby burnt my other ones,"My husband turnd on the stove while on the phone forgetting to remove the burner cover, so he replaced them with this set and I love it...Reston Lloyd Electric Stove Burner Covers, Set of 4, Rooster"
3,Ok for the price,The covers are pretty thin. For the price they were an ok bargain. One of the large covers (the one on top when shipped) had a small dent on it. They are good for a temporary solution for a burner cover.
2,Shiny but flimsy,"This metal is almost paper thin - they are bright and very shiny but won't last very long. Don't recommend and wouldn't buy again, not returning only because they were inexpensive and look good enough to last until I can find something more substantial."
2,CHEAP AND THIN. POOR QUALITY,"I needed covers to cover the burners on my stove. On the stove they look ok, but if you touch them and are not careful, they dent. Very...cheaply made. I am starting to look for others. I used to have porcelain ones but HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES no longer sell them. I would not recommend to others."
4,Gets the job done.,"This product does what it claims to do. Ive been pleased with the comfort of the pad that goes into the crotch of the panties. My daughter hasnt complained once about anything being uncomfortable. However I was a little dissappointed at the cumbersome alarm box. Its fairly heavy and pulls the pjs off her shoulder. The wire is run under her shirt to the panties. I guess I didnt research it properly, but I think this is a little outdated for the times. Would have liked to had something more streamlined maybe wireless? The alarm is definatly loud enough to wake her even on the low tone and she's a dead sleeper! We are going on our 3rd week of use and it seems to be working. We plan to use a whole month (as school is fixing to start) to be sure she is getting in the habit of waking herself up."
1,Big Disappointment,"We purchased this item in hopes that we wouldn't have to use it longer than a previous brand we had. The first brand was purchased with the idea in mind that we may need to use it for our second child. It turns out we did use it for both the first child and then the second child. Unfortunately, our second child had a relapse, at which point we needed to replace the item. I wasn't willing to pay the price for the same brand we had previously. In retrospect, you get what you pay for. I truly wish I had stayed with the original bed-wetting alarm brand we had bought years ago. This one just didn't even come close to helping my child. We only used it for 2 weeks before it started acting up. We followed all instructions to no avail. I would not recommend this product. I would recommend spending the extra money for the better product."
1,great prospect until it broke :(,"We were very dissapointed with this product.My daughter started showing signs of doing very well when using it - she had a week of staying dry, when the box started to come apart. Then the alarm wouldn't go off. My husband worked on the box and was able to sauder wires back to working condition, and the alarm started working again, but now, both of the pads are broken because of the wires being disconnected.I wish that this had worked better - for spending this much money on something for the hopes of being able to save money on pull ups, and not even being able to get to 6 weeks of staying dry because of the whole system breaking, it is frustrating. Now we need to research again and hopefully find something better that will last - and spend more money :( We purchased it in the middle of June and it is August 1st and completely unusable."
5,Skating party number ONES,"My god, it's hard to believe that sixteen years ago I was jamming out to these tracks at my local roller skating rink. What a trip, I still remember every lyric! Some great memories associated with these songs! Take a trip down memory lane with this album."
3,the era of milli vanelli,the music by civilles&coles was good but who is actually singing? this group was happening during the lip synch era.and there follow ups show.catchy in a soda pop fitness work out way nothing ground breaking but catchy.
5,Love this CD it jamming,This is a hot old school CD. Everybody dance now get up and pop it shake it make it hot.
3,Just how expected,Basiclly I bought the item for one song: don't touch it. So the rest of the songs really doesnt matter that are no so good.
4,A Good Fibromyalgia Resource,"This book is current and up to date on FM and covers the key issues well. As a resource, it includes an overview of Fibromyalgia, treatments(medical and alternative), therapies, sound advice, and insights on how to manage life and relationships. Easy to read format, and set up so that you can skip around to chapters without being lost."
2,"Not too bad, but nothing much really","Now don't get me wrong here. It's a great movie, well a good movie. But this isn't the movie, it's the comic book.The problem is, it IS the movie! There is nothing here that stands out on it's own from the movie and all the other hype. It's a good movie, but it's not a good comic book in it's own right.Or to simplify further, it'd be better if there wasn't a movie, because this is just the movie on paper (well, a movie on paper is a script, but you get the metaphor). If you've seen the movie, don't bother. If not, go ahead."
5,One of the best episode 1 books!,This is one of the best Episode 1 books available. It captures every bit of the movie in awesome detail. I'd give this book 10 stars (if that was an option.) GREAT READING!
2,Too literal,"The Star Wars film-to-comic adaptations have been notoriously bad, and this one is no exception. Oh, the art isn't as drab as the previous adaptations, and it's not as hard to follow, but it's judt boring. It follows the film much too literally, and even though from some of the pictures it's clear the artists didn't have the complete movie to work from, even the poses and facial expressions like copied from the film.This would have been a much better comic if it had been combined with the Episode I Adventures story into one big, comprehensive graphic novel, but as it is, it's just boring.Also, the art, which as I said isn't dull, still isn't great. I feel that there was a lot of unexploited potential in this comic, and I don't understand why such a visually-oriented film should be so hard to convert to the comic medium.Stay away from this one."
1,Shackle rusting less than 2 months later,I bought these specifically because they are supposed to be rustproof but what I found after about 6 weeks is the shackle is starting to rust on both locks. They are both installed on gates that are outside and sheltered by the roof overhang. Master Lock's policy requires you to mail the locks to them and they'll send replacements in 6-8 weeks but that's a long time to go without locks so I guess I'm out of luck.
4,Good,"I purchased these two locks for my gun case, so it would meet FAA flight standards. The locks are really narrow so it was a tight squeeze to get them to lock for what I wanted them for. Other than that outstanding product."
1,"Dishes are beautiful, but chip very easily","I owned a set of these dishes for 4 years. They were beautiful, and we always received compliments on them, but I definitely would not recommend them for daily use. Most of the bowls chipped as did several of the plates."
1,They break and chip way too easy!!,I've owned different stoneware and was very disappointed on the durability. They break very easily and many of my plates have chips. I agree with another reviewer that the dishes heat up extremely hot in the microware. Another downside is that they are made in China. On looking at several department stores just about every dishware set is made in China. A recent article in a local paper indicated that if you have dishes from China you should test for lead. Because of this reason I have just bought Fiestaware which is made in the US and is totally lead free! From searching on the internet these dishes appear to be very durable. I would definitely stay away from the Sango dishes.
1,Pretty but not durable,"My wife and I bought 2 of the four place settings, along with the cream/sugar set and the serving platter/serving bowl about 3 years ago. We thought this was an aesthetically pleasing pattern. I can accept some chipping due to careless handling, but I am disappointed by a problem with the salad plates. If you look at the picture, there is a spiral quality to the glaze/finish. We have had 5 of these plates break in the dishwasher, with failures along the spirals --- breaking into crescent shaped fragments. I would not buy this product again."
2,Disappointing Sango Splash,"The purchase and delivery of the product was fast and easy and the packaging was secure and nothing was broken.This set is very hard to find in local stores so when I saw it available online I didn't hesitate to purchase it. However, I purchased this set to add to the existing place settings and other pieces I already had. It appears that the manufacturer forgot to add the various colorings to the mix which enhances the attractiveness and unique look of these dishes. The main color is very pale in comparison to the set that I already have and there are hardly any of the accent colors which make these dishes stand out . I am very disappointed in the quality and look of this product."
4,Splash is a good buy,"I love this dinnerware! My only complaint is that they do chip easily and are very scratchy sounding! They are really beautiful and unique and I have had a lot of comments on them. At the low price, I would suggest putting away a set for replacements. I am actually buying 2 sets for replacements because I want to keep them in use for a long time and I hate chipped dishes!"
2,"great aesthetics, poor quality","These fit our family's style perfectly and we got the main set along with the pitcher, serving bowls, and other pieces, hating to spend the money but thinking these would last for many years. Well, they might actually last, if not completely intact, because we rarely use them. We're super careful with the dishes, yet they keep chipping. The texture is odd, parts of them seemingly unglazed, and forks running across them make an awful sound. I guess by microwavable they meant ""won't catch fire or explode,"" but these get so hot a potholder is necessary for getting one out of the microwave. Might be nice for people who display their dishes on the wall or in glass cabinets, but I recommend avoiding these dishes for actual use as dinnerware."
2,these plates chip very easily,"We bought this dinnerwear set and within the first month 3 of the bowels had chips on the edge. I think they are very attractive dishes, but they are not worth the money."
2,Nice looking but not durable.,I have have this set for approximately 3 years. Almost half of the pieces have chips on them. I have had at least two break while in the microwave. I just do not think that they are well made but for an occasional use piece they would be fine.
5,Yummy Healthy Sensible Foods Snacks,"These individual snack size bags are perfect for moms on the go. A nutritious snack everyone can enjoy. I saw them at the store for $1.75/bag, and these are just over $1/bag from Amazon. No sugar added, and very tasty fruits inside. Even my picky 3-year-old loves them. I only wish they had more strawberries in the mix."
5,"Healthy, delicious treat","Love, love, love this snack. It's low in calories with no sugar added, and it is definitely satisfying. I like to add it to 0% fat Greek yogurt and it really kicks it up a notch into a nice treat. It also satisfies my sweet tooth.Much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than buying single packets at Vitamin World or one of those other GNC-like stores."
2,falls apart,"This mix was very sour, and because of the way the fruits are dried, there were a LOT of crumbs inside the packets."
1,AWFUL - like eating air filled kibble,"What can I say, but ""ICK"". Sour, gross, even the kids won't eat them. We finally threw them out. What a disappointment and waste of money."
4,Good addition to healthy snack arsenal,"This is a tasty freeze-dried fruit blend. For the calories in it (84), you get a pretty good snack that'll take you a while to finish. It's a mix of apples, cherries, blueberries, and strawberries - all healthy fruits. No preservatives, fillers, etc. Maybe a bit overpriced, but convenient."
4,"Cool idea, but I bought too much","I really liked the idea of having pure fruit at my disposal at any time of the day. I didn't realize that after eating these bags, I would get a bit overwhelmed with the concentration of sugar in these bags. All natural sugar to be sure, but it is a bit overwhelming. Two years later, I still haven't finished eating the 24 packs that I purchased, but it's a lot harder for one person to eat 24 than for a family so... make sure you like this before you buy in bulk!"
4,Sensible Snacking,"The Sensible Foods Cherry Berry snacks are great. I keep them at my desk and anytime I need a little something they are perfect. No drips or dribbles on the keyboard. I have ordered some other selections of the dried fruit, but be mindful that there are more apple pieces than berries. The pouches average about 2 blueberries, 6 strawberry slices and 2 cherries."
4,Food fruit snack,Very good product to have on hand if you need a quick on-the-go snack. Good tasting and easy to eat. I keep a couple in my car to snack on if I can't stop for a meal right away.
5,Sweet and crunchy!,"The Cherry Berry snacks from Sensible Foods are my new favorite food on the go. I've taken them on road trips, shared them at the office, and even gave them as stocking-stuffers this year. I find them delightfully sweet and crunchy, which is perfect for my typical snack craving. The powder at the bottom of the bag doesn't bother me, but I can understand the frustration some folks have voiced; if you get it on your hands with any moisture at all, it can stick. I always have little hand wipes in the car or in my purse, so it hasn't caused me any trouble. I highly recommend this product as a healthy alternative to candy, and I'm looking forward to trying other flavors."
5,Sensible as it as.,"I think their name says it all-""Sensible Food"". It's a great snack and good for you. My dog Chloe loves it too. :)"
3,3.5 stars for 4 good westerns,"I won't go into the story lines since those are covered in other reviews. I'm just adding my vote to the overall total. These are all good westerns. None of them are great, but none are really poor either. If you like the old westerns, you will like these movies. They are all diferent, so the set has a good variety."
4,pretty doggone good,"If you like the classical western (pre spaghetti)format you're going to like these collections. It's a little tempting to rate these as trite but remember, they really did a lot to create the genre, from the goofy Technicolor quasi musicals like ""California"" (replete with angels screaming ""gold!"" and zombie-like miners deserting the wagon train for the gold fields) to the honest and humble Glenn Ford in ""The Man From the Alamo"" which also showcases High O'Brien. The man can ride!""Man"" also has, to my mind, the most incredible horse stunt ever towards the end of the film - you'll just have to watch to see it. For horse stunt aficionados it's better than the downhill ride in ""The Man From Snowy River""Real extras who can actually ride. Real pulldowns. Great acting. Plots both silly and serious, all in all, a ""great ride""."
3,Parrots a Guide to parrots of the World,Great Book Really nice drawn painted pics of the Birds.Tells where in the World there from and Regones there in.But No Good Mapes of the area there in..
2,Must be better out there,"This would be a great book if it is the last in your large collection, and you are looking for a card specific to something obscure like celebrating a chinese take-out! If you are looking for all around good ideas that can be easily adapted to a multitude of purposes and projects, this just isn't the book. While pretty to look at, I was disappointed from a practical point of view. I was going to sell it - until I noted that 40 other readers obviously thought the same thing (but didn't take the time to write a review it seems) Your time and dollars would be well spent looking for something else."
2,"some clever, some fill","This book has some clever ideas but not enough to warrant ""50 quick and easy"" projects. There are a dozen or so that are quite fussy and seemingly without purpose, like the What's cooking? card, the beehive card, tropical escape, and the blue jeans card. The Wild kingdom card message is supposed to be Run wild, Stand tall, Be strong. I send cards for thanks yous, get wells, and thinking of yous plus the usual holidays and can think of no time when a zebra or giraffe theme would have been appropriate. That's what I mean by filler. With some stretch you could possibly actually use them. One thing to watch out for in this book is how much money you can end up spending on tools and materials. Many of the ingredients are of the store-bought kind, like vellum, stamps, and letter stickers, not 'found' things from around the house.A greeting card book with more clever and less filler and expense would have garnered this a five star rating."
3,Some useful examples,"This is ""okay,"" but I don't think I would buy it again if I had been able to flip through it at a store."
5,another fabulous studio offering,"More excellent work from the Indigo Girls. ""1 2 3"" was a little too rough for my tastes when I first heard the CD, but it grew on me... the rest of the tracks need no such ""growing"" time... they're excellent tracks and great to listen to. ""Hammer and a Nail"" is this album's answer to ""Closer to Fine"" on their self-titled debut.If you've only gotten the first installment of their work, you're really missing out if you don't pick this one up, too. The songs are a real treat and easy on the ears and the heart."
5,N*I*S ROCKS!!!,"i have been a fan of the girls for about 8 years now. nomads*indians*saints is by far my favorite IG recording ever. the styles range from amy's rawness (""1 2 3"") to emily's profound deep reasoning (""you and me and the 10,000 wars""). ""hammer and a nail"" (mary chapin carpenter backs them up) is the best ""get up and do it"" song ever. everyone can relate to ""watershed"". amy's fear of dying is expressed in ""world falls"". it is just a wonderful recording and i think that EVERYONE must have it!"
5,THIS BOOK IS A HIT,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK BY JACK TATUM, FORMER OAKLAND RAIDER. THE BOOK IS BOTH INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING. IT IS ALMOST 100% ABOUT FOOTBALL. A SMALL BUT DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS CHILDHOOD IS DISCUSSED EARLY ON BUT THE REST IS HIS CAREER IN HIGH SCHOOL, OHIO STATE AND OAKLAND. HIS OPINIONS AND INSIGHTS CONCERNING THE BEST AT DIFFERNT POSITIONS, AND COACHES IS A MAJOR HIGHLIGHT. I ALSO FOUND HOW HE FELT AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH DARRYL STINGLEY TO BE ANOTHER HIGHLIGHT TO THIS VERY GOOD READ. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS. A HIT BOOK BY THE RAIDER HIT MAN."
5,Fair on B. Marsalis,"I have never seen in me the right to comment, let alone criticise, about either recorded music or the recording musicians. Yet, the only review I read on a URL associated with Branford Marsalis's 'Beautiful Ones' urged me to my keyboard for the sake of fairness.This album is by far the best of Mr. Marsalis and his fellow jazzmen, Bob Hurst and Tain Watts. Tunes ringing in my mind, I can go as far as to argue that this little ensemble of a trio is one of the most elegant of modern music and can hardly be heard to its best on any other CD. I cannot imagine a serious Brandford Marsalis listener having missed this one out.Totally intriguing."
3,Not Very Accessible,"Although one cannot deny it is a top-notch music-making, this recording might be too abstract for some people's taste. The compositions are harmonically free and rhythmically loose reminding me of late Coltrane. I just wish there were a few tracks that are more straightforward or emotionally loaded."
2,You better like Marsalis.,"I'd heard Branford play on other cds (Russia House Soundtrack and with Sting) and I liked Wynton and Ellis Marsalis's music so I assumed I'd like this. Not the case. This is for diehard fans only. I like jazz, but this is just a little too much. I hate to say it, but I guess I need a little more Kenny G-ish music. This is hard core jazz."
1,Poor quality,Very disappointed. Chip on tureen and ladle was broken. This was to be a xmas gift. Will proceed to pick a brand that I know and hope the packaging will protect the product.
1,Arrived shattered,"Arrived broken, I should have listened to the advise given about the shipping. However, in all fairness, Amazon was quick to allow me to return, and just as quick as crediting our account."
5,Good Read,"Interesting book about an interesting person. I knew of Adam Clayton Powell as I grew up but I never knew what a powerful man he was. His inter-actions with other Afro American leaders was interesting. He was both pro-government but also militant. He dealt with some corruption but his charm always got him through. He treated women badly because he couldn't be faithful to his mates but women found him attractive. His life entails alot of 20th Century history of our country.Very interesting read, I recomend it."
1,don't waste your money,This shower cap's elastic broke within a few weeks of owning it. Very disappointed in the quality.
5,another great book about the Santa Fe,"One is hard-pressed to find more beautiful trains than those run by the Santa Fe at the peak of American railroading in the mid-twentieth century.What a wonderful array of silvery observation-lounge and observation-sleeper cars. All documented here and beautifully photographed. So many different styles for so many name trains: Chief, Super Chief, Texas Chief, etc.I love all books about the extraordinary trains of the period, and this is one of the best: beautiful, well-produced photos with informative text.A great trip down memory lane."
2,Lock too easy to pick,"Even though this lock offers convenience in being able to set your own combination, it is very insecure. Once could pull on the lock while spining the number dials to easily pick the lock. In fact, had this lock on my luggage traveling in Asia, and arriving at my destination the lock was missing. Instead, check out the 4-dial combination lock from Brinks. If you pull the lock while spinning the dials, even when you get to the correct combination the Brinks lock won't fall open. Instead, you need to release the tension (stop pulling on the lock), then pull for it to open. So somebody trying to pick your Brinks lock has to go one number at a time vs spining quickly thru an entire sequence of numbers on the Master Lock."
3,Cheap and worth the price,"Bought this lock when I joined a new gym. The self-setting feature is good, but don't expect this lock to ward off anyone with a small amount of determination to break into your locker.PLEASE NOTE: not for folks who need reading glasses; the numbers are way too small for easy reading."
3,Not what I expected from Master,"The lock is heavy and durable. Its a pain to set your combination, and you have to jumble the numbers in order to lock it. The lock face numbers are inverted, so you have to tilt your head a certain way to look at the numbers. Other then these inconviences, I give this lock * * * - Not what I expected from such a good lock company."
1,Quality lost,"I purchased one of these lock from the local hardware store. After 3 days of use, the lock fell apart, while opening and taking off of locker. Perhaps the exact position that it was to be programmed at? This is the manufacturer's question to answer, since I picked up all the parts that had scattered around the locker room and returned the product."
3,Adequate,"This lock works for my intended use, which is basically just a way to keep a plastic shed in my backyard closed. I didn't buy it planning on high security. But it is smaller than I expected (basically luggage-lock sized), isn't super secure with only 999 combos, and the locking action doesn't seem too secure. It has a high-quality finish and the body is nice and strong, but the locking loop and mechanism just don't seem up to master lock standards."
1,NO USE FOR IT NOW,"The lock is so small that it won't do you any good b/c it will just come right off if you pull it harder. Also, the 1/8"" shackle diameter is so tiny that it won't even fit into a gym locker. USELESS LOCK!"
3,Average at best,This was an average compilation of B.B.'s music it had a few of the real good ones and some of the not-so-good ones. The audio quality was so-so also. If you LOVE B.B. then maybe you would want this one just because of the artist. For casual listeners of blues and/or B.B. King I think you can probably find a better compilation of his songs or of this genre.
3,Boring book.,"This book has too many technical trivia for my taste.However, it may be interesting for others who are more interested in the technical details."
5,Excellent,This film brought tears to my eyes. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. It's comforting to know miracles still happen in this modern day world.
4,rebecca@nonoise.com,"Klein is a man in the process of waking up from our wackyculture's notions of food-as-drugs and this-is-beautiful.This post-modern diet book retrieves the older, more positivevaluations of fat, and attempts to ""transvalue"" fat inanticipation of a possible return to a fat idea of beauty.He supplies some in-depth analysis of some of the moreflawed recent attempts to re-instate the outrageouslylow ideal weight charts of the fifties, and discusses someof the less publicized risks associated with the latestin diet drug cocktails. It's a book worth reading, even ifit self-describes as an attempt to charm you into changingthe way you view fat. I recommend supplementing it withLevenstein's excellent histories of wacko food fads inAmerica: _Paradox of Plenty_ and _A Revolution at theTable_. You might also try Shapiro's _Perfection Salad_."
2,More Fun Than Eating Celery (But Only Just),"Perhaps it's not fair to review a book before i've finished it. Then again, I doubt if I _will_ finish it. 20 pages into the lengthy (it takes up over a 1/3 of the book) and turgid introduction, I skipped ahead to the first chapter. I can sum up the first 20 pages of that as:""'fat' is old English for 'vat', and Shakespeare used the word 'fat' a lot"".There may be the bare bones of an interesting anthropology pamplet here, but it's so wrapped up in dead repetitive prose I found it indigestible."
5,A Global Gift,"As an author, teacher, and concerned world citizen, I am awed by the depth and compassion woven into this highly-readable anecdotal book. Don't let the stories fool you, though. This book will enhance your interactions with others. If we practiced Storycatching, Christina-style, there would be so much more joy and justice in our world."
5,"Excellent, experienced sober strategies and advice","Practical, levelheaded strategies and advice that obviously come from experience. Not full of polemics like many investment books...every paragraph adds to the reader's understanding toward direct application. You could read many of the popular investment books and never run into the techniques she presents which are an essential part of any portfolio manager's arsenal. While the book's title might seem to be for fearful investors, the book is actually focused on returns, and the techniques should allow an investor to make more aggressive moves in line with their goals when one has some control over the risks, through hedging, negative correlations within the portfolio, appropriate investment vehicles, and using options for controlled profit-taking and safer entries and exits even when entering into more volatile positions for which the risk could otherwise be prohibitive."
2,Not what I expected,"I wasn't at all impressed with this book for a few reasons. Although the pictures were beautiful and tried most desperatly to pull us into the story, we just couldn't get to the same place that the author must have been while writing the book. Maybe after reading just the first sentence: ""Sometime after summer is spent but before jack-o'-lanterns are lit, it's apple picking time."", which seems to assume that everyone is interested in celebrating Halloween.In addition to this, the book speaks twice about ""the purple ticket"" that gets punched with a half moon. I still can't figure out what that is for. There are no explanations about the meaning of this and that is frustrating because it seems important but only the writer knows why. The sad part is that he kept this detail to himself and it's annoying.We tried to enjoy this book, but at this point its end will be in our Goodwill pile."
5,Healing Magnets,"No mumbo-jumbo, airy-fairy or super-technical explanations here. clear and concise, with tons of medical studies. This is the book to read if you really want to understand magnetic healing."
5,Excelent starter,"This is one of the best starter books I have ever read on this field. Clear, concise, right at the point and fairly ojective! Also liked the many refferences at the end, and the practical, do-it-yourself advice! If you want to start learning about magnet therapy and you want to do it yourself, this is the book!"
3,This boook sucks (no pun intended),This book is boring and has moves that you have to be a contortionist to perform. I just like the pics.
2,Lousy service - have recived no info as to subs recd,Lousy service - there has been zero contact from the publisher as to whether they had received a subscription and when one might expect the subscription to beginNot happy at all with the service on the magazine subscription.
3,"Not bad, but there are better of the same.","I must say that the photos in this book do not lack dynamism. The photographers have gone to extremes to ensure that the poses are full of motion and gesture. However, as a figurative artist I can not use this book extensively because of the lack of feasibility of the poses. The figures jumping and twisting around are interesting but the poses are generally not useful."
5,i love this book,this book was filled with photos - and that's it. unlike the ones that are filled with instructions and then maybe 2 or 3 photos. this gave me plenty of references to look at while drawing. it has many different positions that - it's really quite hard to get a person to pose like that for you. i highly reccommend it!!
3,"decent book, not a must-have","the photographs aren't of the BEST quality [very grainy], but that didn't really bother me much.the poses are very un-natural and a little forced.there is a lack of male models in this, so if you're looking to use this as a reference book for males i suggest you keep browsing elsewhere.over-all a good buy."
3,Sometimes useful,"I've had this book for a long time and I used to refer to it quite a bit when I was teaching myself to draw moving figures.It is handy from time to time when you need something a bit different, or to kickstart an idea, but it is far from a general purpose figure reference book. The poses are too idiosyncratic.The photos have all been taken with very fast film with the result that it looks very grainy, which can be a problem if you need detail."
2,If You've Got the Money and Space to Spare ...,"A picture book of live nude models caught in mid leap or whirl, with various lighting. Divided into the single female figure (Playboy this ain't), the single male figure (no g-string), and groups (4 whole shots). Good if you need a reality check to make Hogarth clear, or just want a starting point to get your mind loose sketching. You know perfectly well that the exact pose you need is not likely to show up in a collection of less than 10,000 shots."
4,Very good for what it is,"This is a book of figures in motion, as it says. The pictures were taken with fast black and white film (looks like Tri-X) and are, as others reviewers have pointed out, very grainy. That's simply an artifict of films and art photography in the 1970's and 80's, before today's fast digital cameras. If the comparison is based on level of detail and skin tone, this book can't hold a candle next to the high resolution digital photos of the Art Models seriesArt Models 6: The Female Figure in Shadow and Light (Art Models series). However, until release of Art Models 7, there also weren't many photos of figures in actual movement in the Art Model series. There's a lot than an artist can do with the images in this book, and I believe that I've seen at least a few works by well known artists that were inspired by some of the poses. I consider this book to be a keeper."
4,As reference is great!,"This book have many good images, I wish they had a higher contrast between black and whites, also higher resolution. But as a start any artist will take advantage of all this images...I started with this book, but will keep buying image reference books here, it's hard and expensive to have a nude model, and for the human figure it is important to keep at least the proportions right, even if later you distort them as you wish in your art works."
2,fit great before washing,"I tried these on and they fit great, very comfortable and soo soft! I washed them in warm water,dried on low and when I tried to where them they no longer fit right. The material between the seams on the pant legs shrunk and the seams did not! This resulted in a puckered appearance and a very uncomfortable fit. If you want to wash in cold water and hang to dry, these were very nice jeans: for me, I dont have that time or patience"
5,Great locks for middle school,"Works well for kids that need two locks in school - only one combo to remember, plus the quality of Master lock."
4,Great value for two Master Locks,"Purchased these as I needed some combination locks. Can't beat the price in getting two of these locks. They work like all my other Master Locks I've purchased & used over the years. The metal loop is a little shorter than I would like, but they work fine. I guess I was used to my older Master locks that have a longer metal loop that I thought was the standard size."
4,Good locks for great price,"Two black masterlocks with matching combo, just as promised. They contain the ""anti-shim"" technology which isn't the ""block-guard"", but is an improvement over the earlier locks. I'm comfortable using mine at a gym locker with moderate foot traffic, but wouldn't trust it to protect an expensive bike overnight."
3,they will do,"Fine for gym lockers in a low-risk neighborhood, and having the same combo means I can call the other half if I forget the numbers. They feel more rackety than I remember Master Locks to be when I last used them 10-20 years ago for college and work lockers. The combinations are preset and fairly forgiving (i.e. you can be off by a notch or two and they will still open). I wouldn't trust them if I were actually concerned about security or stashing things more valuable than toiletries and clothing."
1,Only one lock worked,"One of the locks did not work, right out of the box. The dial did not turn smoothly, which made it impossible to get the combination right and the lock would not open.Good idea to have two locks with same combination."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,I was looking for locks that had the same combination so that I would not have to remember two different combinations for work and the gym. This is exactly that and Master Lock is wonderful brand. Couldn't be happier!
3,Hercules in a haunted world,"I expected a campy movie since that is part of the fun of watching old movies. However, I did not expect the production to be so poor. When I saw it I thought it looked like someone had filmed it as it played off an old TV set. I half expected to see some midnight movie commercials in the middle of the film. I would rank it so so. It would be better to rent for a lark than actually buy it for keeps (IMO)."
4,If You Are Reading This Get It,"I figure if you are here you came here for a reason. It's either because you stumbled upon this CD by fate or you have heard of the Trees. Either way, get this CD. If you enjoy music that isn't just about some inane, simplistic vision of love, or rock n roll that does more than just rock(which this does). Pick this up. It's the musical equivelent of magic realism. Forget the 'psychadellic' crap. It's full of imagary and imagination, and a sense that there is more, not just out there but in us. It rocks and it makes you feel. Mark Lanegan's voice thick, smooth and full. It's a man's voice, not some whiny kid's voice. The music is fierce while remaining melodic. ""Beyond This Horizon""'s ending drum fills swirl and phase shift around your head. ""Before We Arise"" will haunt you. ""Closer"" ends in a bluesy fury. As a whole it's just really, really cool. Just buy the disc. It's ten bucks. Buy it. Ten bucks. Buy. Disc. Ten. Disc. Buy. ;)"
5,if I were on a desert island...,"It has always been one of my all time favorites. Not just from this band, but by any band. Excellent."
5,Hail To Uncle Anesthesia! Fantastic CD!,Uncle Anesthesia is definitely one of the best CDs of this period. I still listen to it and very much enjoy it today. This CD has great range and sophistication. You won't be sorry if you buy it!
2,Damn I hate this album,"THis cd is produced by chris cornell from soundgarden, and if you are a fan of soundgarden you will....hate this album. The reviews must have been written by members of the band. It hurts me just to listen to one song. There are lots of used ones for sale for less for a reason."
4,High Score for this book!,"I enjoyed this book,it's really enjoyable.Jessica scores so well on her sats that she is falsely accused of cheating!Elizabeth says a speech defending her twin which is very good too."
3,Would be great but it has fallen off a few times.,"I have it installed on my hospital bed rail. The parts go on each side of the rail and then screw together with two screws. Then there is a slot in the piece you want to have toward you that you put the white piece into. The white piece has a oblong sized projection that is about 2 inches long, it fits into the slot and then turns, once turned, you tighten it all up, with the enclosed knob, then, it is ready to use.All in all it is a good cup holder. I just have had it come off the slot a couple of times and don't know why it has happened.God bless you, Lisa"
1,Don't buy this....just not good enough,"The product kept going off when my son would move around on it and is too late by the time the child starts going they have already went all the way....NO way for him to stop it. Even more embarrassing for him. Wish I could exchange it now for the one that goes in the pants to compare with. My son is 12 years old and this is our last hope, but if the equipment isn't as good what can we do? So, not happy!Wet Call Bed-Side Bed wetting Alarm with Pad"
1,Terrible customer service on return of poor quality item,"This item is very poor quality - it looks like it was made in the 70's. The plastic casing and switches are clearly sub-par for an electronic device, the velcro has safety pins on it to secure the alarm to a bed, and on top of that it did not even work at all! When we asked for a refund, they decided to replace it instead. When we refused delivery on the replacement item, they charged us a 25% restocking fee. The customer service rep was rude and flat-out lied to me about her conversation with my husband. All in all a terrible experience. Do not order this item and especially not from this company!Update: we received a full refund including the restocking fee, but we had to go through the Amazon claims process to get it..."
3,Okay product. Easy to break.,"This works with a lot of fussing. You need to encase the pad in a pillow case or your child's sweat will trigger the alarm. The wires are not soddered together well and if your child drops the electric box the wires will pull apart, making the item useless. Make sure you pin or velcro the box to something stable so your child does not move it."
2,Marginal,"The greatest disappointment with this novel is the lack of character development. It seems like the author expect the reader to know her characters or at least of them before opening the book. There is too little about them to come to know or care about them through the entire work.They are good and interesting characters and some stand out like the brilliant depiction of an agent who poses as a mental health professional who pretends to be a different, classical, psychiatrist from the past every day. As he goes from Freud to Jung and onwards, he entertains greatly. This character is the highlight of the book.At some points it is laboriously written and at others far too little detail surfaces to give much insight or understanding to the reader.A good effort, it is possible the book was over-edited or written about characted the author is very acquainted with in her own mind and that connection was lost on paper."
5,Nice to find!,"I love my Toughbook, magnesium case model looks like Special Ops equipment. Still works great, and updated to XP recently. It was nice to find an OEM battery for it, most are refurbished. Works great! Good price from the vendor with fast shipping."
3,A mixture,'Days of Heaven' has one of Morricones most haunting soundtracks which complements the movie's vast visual presence and doom ridden narrative. Its combination with a lightweight western comedy sountrack on this CD soundtrack is incongruous - thank goodness for programmable CD players!
3,Remastered version?,"Not a review, but a question to those who bought this 2010 release. Is this CD a remastered soundtrack? Has it a better quality than the 1995 CD?"
2,"Too much Sara, not enough Heaven.","Being a fan of Ennio Morricone, I was surprised to hear how boring the music for ""Two Mules for Sister Sara""was. Compared to his other soundtracks, it pales. ""Days of Heaven"" on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous, but be warned, ""Days of Heaven"" is not the same entire soundtrack that was released on LP in 1978. The beautiful opening song, (I'm not sure of its title) is not on the CD, nor is the slide guitar music on the disc either. I could have lived with the ""Sara"" music if ""Days of Heaven"" was complete, but it's not, and that's what makes the combination so disappointing."
4,FOR BASIC PROPHETIC KNOWLEDGE,"THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN, EASY TO READ PRIMER ON BASIS PROPHETIC PLANS THAT ARE BIBLICAL. THIS BOOK PVRVIDES THE READER A STARTING POINT ON WHICH TO BUILD."
2,Still not a good DVD transfer of this great 1934 film...,"...but if you have to choose between this one and the slightly cheaper Alpha Video dvd, pick this one until someone actually takes the time to restore this film and give it the treatment it deserves. The picture quality isn't very good at all and the sound isn't much better, but it is still better than the one Alpha puts out."
2,"Terrible sound, great movie","My 2-star comment is not about the movie but the quality of the dvd. I do realize this movie is from the thirties, but there has got to be a better way. If the sound cannot be remastered, at least subtitles would help as much of the dialogue cannot be deciphered.However, the movie is a must-see for die hard Davis fans. If you fall under this category you should probably still get the film but be warned that the sound and overall quality are inferior."
4,Bright Latin Dance,"I give this a 4 only because it's not really my kind of music (having grown up on Rock), but there is no lack of appreciation for the amazing talent of these two incredible guitarists. This would be awesome music for a Latin dance party or a mexican fiesta. Good stuff!Addenda 11-20-07: R.I.P Ruben Romero. I learned recently of the untimely death of this talented musician. The music world has lost a master."
2,Lock jammed after 4 months of use,This lock jammed after 4 months of use. It would not open anymore and I had to cut it off.
3,It's a lock,It's just a little lock. No big deal. I just put it on my back gate and after 5 years I need a new one.
3,I like the design but the quality is cheap,I like the design of this combination lock but the latch is so flimsy that it bent within a month.
2,Master?,"I was very hopeful for this lock when I ordered it. I really only needed something very simple to keep my swim locker locked at school. When this arrived, I found that the thing part of the curve seemed to be a bit flimsy, but like I said, I wasn't looking for Fort Knox. The thing that really killed the review of this lock for me was the fact that it did not fit through the locker hole and I had to order a completely different one. When the title said ""Backpack Padlock"" I thought it meant that it was easy to carry on backpacks... now that I think about it, it's FOR locking the zippers on backpacks together.Pros:LightweightInexpensiveEasy to useSmallCons:Flimsy locking mechanismDoesn't fit through much (like a locker)If this review was useful, please click yes!"
2,Lock it up and throw away the key,"I can't recommend this lock. As mentioned in other reviews, it is too small to go around anything of size. I bought it to go around a double zipper gun bag. The problem was the lock part was too big to go throw the hole. So I am not for sure what this can be used for. Its hole is to small to go around anthing big but the hook part is too big to go through anything small.Plus the build quailty is questionable and feels pretty cheap. I didnt try but I bet it could be broken easly. I would reccomend this lockMaster Lock 4688D TSA Accepted Cable Luggage Lock in Assorted Colors, 1-Packas a abetter alternative."
2,Warning: don't buy this for locker use,"I made the mistake of buying this thinking it would be a nice change from a traditional dial combo round lock that I was using at the gym. Unfortunately, of 3 different gyms that I have been with in 3 different cities, this backpack padlock will not open far enough to allow you to hook it through the traditional locker holes which are too thick. I should point out that the product did not specifically specify ability to use with lockers, so much of this is my own fault."
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"I'm a big fan of Revenge of the Nerds. That's a really fun movie to watch and also teaches you a few things. I can't say how many times I've watched it since the '80s. This sequel should never have been made. It just isn't worthy. It in no way is as captivating, enduring, or funny as Revenge of the Nerds. There are some scant funny moments, but most of the scenes that are supposed to be funny just aren't. Takashi (the oriental guy from the first film) wasn't even in this movie. The story was plodding and for the most part uninteresting. I was disappointed even back when Nerds in Paradise was released many years ago. Some movies just don't need sequels. Stick to the first movie and don't bother with this second installment. Sequels aren't always bad, but some movies just don't need them."
2,Revenge of the Alpha's,"All I can say is ""why?"" I guess after the first one it would be hard to take this any place else! The plot was VERY thin and the jokes just did not work. They also tried way to hard to re use some of the things from the first movie. Did we realy need a second Nerds concert? Also, why take it to Florida? I would, if they had to make another one, would have liked to see it take place the next school year. To see the changes and what things were like with Gilbert and the Greek council. I know Nerds 3 tries to go into changes on Adams in the future after the original Nerds are gone."
2,Yellow lab tore it in two!,"My yellow lab (7 mo old male) tore it in two this morning after playing with it for over 4 months. I had inserted a nice treat into it which made him all the more intense on getting it out! Rip.... there goes the head of the ""tough"" Rhino Cone!!!"
2,Less than 2 weeks with my 6 month old AmBulldog,"I thought this sounded tough enough for my 6 month old American Bulldog but I was wrong. She wouldn't play with it for the first week - I had to fill it with treats for her to even show interest. Once she started chewing, it was less than two weeks before she started taking chunks out of it. Probably a good toy for less agressive chewers."
3,Good CD but overly priced.,I like the music on this CD and Tata's voice is beautiful. Why does it cost over 30.00 though? I bought mine for a reasonable 12.00. Good sound and you will enjoy her melodic riffs.
4,A Keeper,"Required a little help from my shoe stretcher (just for 60 seconds...really...only needed that to loosen it up), but this one is a KEEPER."
4,Big,"I love the color, shape and fabric of this shoe but for some reason the Nine West Rocha pumps I bought so far all fit rather large. I bought a size 5.5 I couldn't wear without stuffing it with things, then went down to 5 and still have to be careful how I walk in it. Definitely fits large, get the size under if you wish to buy it."
1,Heel issue,"The back of the shoe was so pointed that even with a heel insert, the shoe wouldn't stay on. I tried my shoe size and a half a size down and nothing worked. Very disappointed."
1,Not Comfortable,"I am very disappointed...I love Nine West Shoes and I can usually buy them in my size and they fit perfectly. But these shoes are incredibly uncomfortable. I am returning them today. The height is fine and I love the platform, but the are so tight across the ball of my feet. They actually pinch my feet. I couldnt wear them for more than 10 seconds and I knew they had to go back. I'm sad."
2,ok but narrow,"the leather looked nice, as did the sole and heel but it was just too narrow in the toes for me, I returned them."
2,Cute shoe but hurt my toes,This is a very nice looking shoe. I ordered a half size down from normal and they still wanted to slip a little on heels. A foot petal in the ball of the foot area would probably take care of this but the toe area on the outsides of foot hurt a little.
2,Nice shoe but doesn't fit,"I bought the Rocha after all the positive reviews and ordered 1/2 size smaller than my regular size (7) but the toe box was super tight and cramped. My feet hurt within a couple minutes of wearing them so back they go... pity because it is a very attractive sue and the color of the shoe and the stacked heel is really nice. FYI, I ordered another pair in 7, and they were way too big and fell off as soon as I tried walking. So beware, the sizing is tricky!"
3,Not worth it for me.,"This pump has narrow toe space, so my toes get sqeezed every time I wear them. Also the thinner platform and higher heels make this pair less comfortable."
4,Needs breaking in...,These are a great classic shoe. However they are bit tight like others have said but I would NOT order a size up because they would have been too long. I am not a wide but I am not narrow either. I have worn them now for a while and they are feeling better on my feet all the time. Also someone mentioned that they are not that sturdy (if you abuse your shoes the way I do)and I would have to agree.
3,shoes size,I love how this shoe looks but it doesn't fit. I'm a size 8 but I wish I had bought it half a size bigger. I wore it to work one day and all my co workers loved it but its sad that I can't wear them again until I find a way to stretch them coz they hurt my feet.
2,Dissappointed,I typically wear anything from a 5 - 5.5. These shoes were way too big. Very dissappointing since I really liked them and it's very hard to find a nice pair of plain black heels.
2,dissapointing experience with Amazon,"Greetings, This is my first dissapointing experience with Amazon. The product: Nine West Women's Rocha Pump, Dark Red Leather, 5.5 M US. Left shoe was perfect; however, the right one is completely damaged: it is shaded and the leather seems to be worn as if someone has already used it for months. The right shoe is in really bad shape and I can not accept it because I bought a ""new"" product (not an used one) of a well-known brand. I would like to know what are my options in this case. Currently, I am not in the United States. Nonetheless, I will stay in Miami from October 31 to November 9. Should I send you the address which I will stay at so you can send me a brand new product? Waiting for an answer and thanking you in advance for your cooperation."
4,Exceleent purchase,I'm very conform with the product. The package was properly arrangeded and protect the shoes for the delivery. The color is exactly as I saw it in the web. I'm very happy with it.
3,Nice but taller than expected,"This shoe looks great online, and I love the rounded toe with a little bit of platform underneath. However it was a lot taller than I expected when I tried them on at home. These were supposed to be for a wedding so comfortableness was important- I had to return them."
4,Classic beauty,"This is a gorgeous shoe and looks good... makes me look good. Sadly, I cannot walk in them without completely blowing the glamor-girl image. Maybe I need more practice. I'll keep them just to admire whether I ever wear them or not."
3,Great shoes. Wish I could wear them!,"I usually wear either a 6.5 or a 7.. 99% of the time it's a 7 so that's what I went with. They are just too big, even with insoles and heel pads. I was so disappointed. I kept them thinking I'd take them to a shoe shop and see if there's anything they can do to help me, cause I do love them. But I wore them to work one day and felt so self conscious because my heels kept slipping out as I walked! Not bad shoes but just take my advice and go a half size smaller."
4,Sexy heels!,These are super cute and sexy! My only issue is that I ordered up a 1/2 size because I thought I read that they ran small... now they are 1/2 size too big!
1,disappointed,"I bought these shoes a couple of months ago.I liked the design so much that I recommended some other people to order them and they did so, but unfortunately the quality is really low, the platform split into two parts on both sides after a week and the same happened to the lining and I noticed that the heel was not positioned correctly from the beginning. I was really disappointed because I wore them only a dozen times, and the same thing happened to all the people who oredered the same shoes. I love the design of Nine West very much but the quality is awful the same happedned to the other pair of shoes by Nine West after a week of wearing them, so my advise is don't buy them if you are not v ery rich."
5,Nine West is the best,"I was so excited when I ordered these shoes and wasn't disappointed in the least. I got the taupe print and it's so classy and subtle. As usual for Nine West, they are comfortable and well built. I commonly wear size 8, but am 7 1/2 in Nine West and that was true again with these. The 7 1/2 fits perfectly. These reminded me exactly why I love Nine West! Tons of compliments from everyone!"
2,Cute shoe or it would have gotten one-star,"Not sure if it was just the pair I received, but there was a good sized scratch across the top and the shoe just didn't look well made... lots of glue showing and rippled all along the edges... not what I am used to from Nine West"
2,Not leather,"I am a little bit dissapointed with this shoes, I love the model but the material is synthetic and it peels in the edges and lose the colour."
1,Terrible quality,"I ordered the shoe twice ,had to return it both times.. leather was stained and damaged both times. I was very disappointed ,the color of the shoe is beautiful."
3,;) nice product,"True to size, cute very fun. They hurt a bit when walking around on the heel skin. Walked around house with them may return. I have them in black and the leather on those does not cause heel discomfort."
5,Nine West Women's Rocha Pump,"I love these shoes,it is one of the most comfortable heels, they are made &#8203;&#8203;of soft leather. I would recommend these shoes, the leg looks good in them, and they are very comfortable."
4,Super cute and fun shoes,Love the looks and fit just right. These pumps go with every thing and make my legs look even longer. Would love to get some more in differect colors
5,Perfect Shoes,"I love these shoes- I have ordered them in three different colors and they are perfect. It is very good for walking, nice material, very elegant and comfortable. Worth every dollar you pay!"
3,Cute but not comfortable,I have been wanting some nude pumps for so long. These are definitely cute but I don't see how previous reviewers thought they were comfortable. Maybe I need to break them in more but for now they will be shoes I wear when I don't need to walk too much.
4,these shoes run huge,I ordered these shoes in both a 7 and a 7 1/2. I usually wear a 7 1/2 in pumps. The 7's were big. I would have to wear some kind of an insole in the 7's. I just ordered a 6 1/2 which I usually never wear. I hope they fit as I really love the look of the shoes and they were comfortable though big. So I basically orderd 3 pairs of shoes to get 1 and paid all the shipping and return shipping but the shoes are very pretty and I haven't seen anything like them around at the stores. So I would say order a smaller size then you usually wear unless your feet are on the wide side.
3,"Cute shoes, but off in sizing","The style of these shoes are super cute. I ordered the Light Green Leather pair, which is a great color that can go well with a variety of neutral colors. I always wear a size 7 in Nine West shoes, so I was dissappointed to find out that a 7 in this particular pair was too big for me. They were a bit more than a half size too big, but not quite a whole size in differnce. I ended up returning them."
3,"DON""T buy your current (true) shoe size!!","Forget what the other reviews are telling you about ordering your true size or smaller. NOT!!! you have to order up. If you read the size chart for Nine West shoes your true size is really smaller in this brand of shoes. BE CAREFUL PEOPLE, when ordering, I had to send mine back the next day after getting them. Amazon will ship you another pair out when u state why your returning but 1st will charge you again until they receive the other pair back. I just received my shoes and they seem comfortable but a little gap in the heel. I couldn't order my true size in this shoe as such, I had to settle for a bigger size."
3,so so....,"After reading all these reviews... major are talking very good about product. But... First of all: size- very huge, mine is 7,5(B) for open toes shoes and 8 for all the other... so, this shoes I've ordered 7,5 and they are really huge, I can enter my finger between my heel and shoe heel counter area.... which is very bad considering Nine West size chart.Second: The color is not the same as on a picture, I choosed taupe and if You choose this option You will see beautiful taupe-beige tone... So, in a real is not, it's more faded greyish taupe tone, like it was used before (My opinion only)...The quality looks good, comfortability - i'm not sure because the heel counter area is very hard and due to wrong size I can't say how is.All over, I can't send them back, because I'm in Dominican Republic, so the price to send'em back is very high, it will cost me a fortune of money, so I'll keep them as a Money spent monument...Be warned anyone who buy any item and can't change later..."
3,Good Buy,The show looks exactly like the photos Amazon provided.Its a little narrow but my feet fit in it comfortably and looks fine. I ordered a 7.5 and there's a bit of extra space; if your feet are inbetween sizes order down.
1,Worst pair of shoes I've ever seen,"I bought this pair of shoes as a gift for my wife, she was very happy with color and model but just at the first time she used them, they completely teared apart in the inside, all the seams split! I won't definitely recommend this shoes, one star because I cant give them none."
2,Nine West Pump,"I love the color, shine and heel. The toe area was way too snug. Only buy if you have very narrow foot."
2,Love the look,"I love the look of these shoes their just not good for walking in. I slipped out of them and was tilted forward awkwardly. I'm just not good with a 4 inch heel. I will stick with a 3 "" heels. If you like 4 "" then you will probably love them."
4,One Sexy Pump!,"These shoes are pretty awesome and sexy! I purchased the brown in an 8.5 and they fit true to size. The craftsmanship is good with the leather and snakeskin design well done. They are also pretty comfortable with good cushioning. The only issue is there's a little bit of a gap in the back but I'm guessing it's a blister prevention, just a bit annoying when you first start to walk in them but after a while it's ok."
3,Suede over Leather,"I am a nine west freak and purchase most of my heals from there. I actually bought the Suede Taupe ones last year and wore them so much that I needed another pair..I actually thought these were the same ones, but they were leather. They are comfortable, they are more brown than taupe (compared to suede), and they scratch easily. Overall I'm kinda upset I didn't get the suede ones, but still love them and they are still comfortable...especially after you break them in!"
4,BUEN ZAPATO,"BUENA CALIDAD, BUENA PIEL Y MUY COMODOS, EL COLOR ES PERFECTO, TAMANO EXACTO EN EL PIE, SON MUY ELEGANTES, LOS RECOMIENDO"
5,perfect fit!,I got them quick and lvove the comfort.They seam to be well made too.]I will consider Nine west again/cindy
4,Great shoes,These are just as the pic shoes and good fitting. I could have done with a wider size but all good.
4,"A little tight, but otherwise awesome!","The only reason I didn't give these shoes 5 stars is because they are a little tight in the toes (I'm 99% sure though that once I've broken them in they'll be perfect). I have fairly slender feet, so if you have wider feet, these definitely aren't the shoes for you! Other than a little tightness, these shoes are perfect! I ordered my usual size, and the shoes fit perfectly length-wise! The cushioned insole makes them quite comfortable to wear."
5,PErfect,"I love it. It is of excellent quality. are comfortable and have received many compliments when I use them. however, in nine west should buy half size smaller."
2,i guess i got a bad pair,every review i read before i bought these was good-the problem with mine was that they looked poorly made- where they were put together there was glue dried all over the shoes-
5,best heels!,"These are the most comfortable heels I've ever had. I work in a job where I have to wear heels pretty much everyday, but I'm also on my feet a lot. I had a pair of these for 2 years that I wore almost everyday. I broke the heel off on accident, so I was so excited to see these on sale on Amazon.They are sized perfectly and once you wear them a few times the leather becomes really soft and even more comfortable. For sizing I would recommend staying true to size; going slightly bigger wouldn't be a good idea because these are real leather and will eventually stretch a little."
4,Love the look--not sure about all day wear,"I bought these for everyday black heals. They do fit great and having the platform front makes them easy to walk or stand. Have only worn them for short time and the confront was so so but they are 4""."
5,A Slipper Pump,"I wear Heals everyday, and these ones feel like slippers right out of the box! AND they dont make a loud obnoxious click noise on tile floors. I am going to order one in every color!!"
2,Nine West Ouch,"I read all the reviews of these shoes about how comfortable they were and was soo looking forward to them. But they were AWFUL. It hurt just to try to slip my foot in for the first time and after 5 minutes of wearing them around the house, I couldn't stand it anymore and printed out the return slip. The angle of these heels puts tremendous pressure on the toes, which are jammed into a fairly narrow vee. I can't imagine what my feet would have felt like after wearing these for a day. Agony. I'm very disappointed."
1,Really uncomfortable. Returned them.,"Way too narrow. Unless you have unusually skinny feet, these shoes are too uncomfortable to wear. No longer willing to suffer to look good! Too bad, because the shoe is great looking."
2,item came with a defect,"item came with a defect with the platform was little detached, besides in some parts of the shoe the synthetic was detached."
2,Who sized these shoes?,The shoe is cute but the sizing is WAY off. I ordered at 7.5 (way too big) so I ordered (from elsewhere) a 7 (STILL way too big)...I've worn a 7.5 for years...didn't even try the 6.5...I gave up!
2,looks great but does not run true to size. also heard rumors about its quality,looks great but does not run true to size. also heard rumors about its quality - that it starts ripping apart in a noticeable way
5,I am in love with these shoes,"These shoes do run big by about 1/2 size. I normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 and with these I had to get size 6 and then add a pad to the back of it and also one for the sole. The effort is worth it, once I got these to fit right, they became my favorite pair of black shoes. They look great with jeans, work pants, skirts, and work dresses. I have them in red suede as well."
3,not the color i expected,"in the pictures the color looks very light when in real it is a very dark beige although i like it , it's not what i needed ..."
3,Too high priced,"My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas this year. Like the other reviewers, we found it frustrating. Everytime she looks for an item on the shopping list, it shuts off before she's through. It is very durable but is hard to push on the carpet. She never uses the scanner because you have to do it exactly right for it to work. I think she was a little dissapointed that it doesn't have a place for her doll to sit. It was not worth $70."
1,SCANNER RARELY WORKS,I bought this particular toy because my daughter wanted to be able to 'Scan and Play'. The scanner doesn't work so she doesn't get to scan only play. I could have saved her the frustration and saved quite a bit of money if I had instead bought a different inexpensive cart. VERY disappointed.
3,VERY CHEAP TOY,"I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY DAUGHTERS FIFTH BIRTHDAY. SHE LOVES THE TOY DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE CANT SCAN THE ITEMS FAST ENOUGH WHEN BARBIE ASKS. ALSO THE TOY DID NOT COME WITH THE CARDS THAT SHE CAN SCAN, I WROTE THEM ABOUT THIS THREE TIMES AND I NEVER GOT A RESPONSE BACK FROM THEM. NOW I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD TOY UNTIL A MONTH AND A HALF LATER THE TOY JUST STOPPED WORKING. THE LAST ITEM SHE SCANNED REMAINED ON THE SCREEN AND IT WONT COME OFF. I CHANGED THE BATTERIES AND EVERYTHING AND THIS TOY DOES NOT WANT TO WORK. I CALLED KID DESIGN INC. AND THEY WANT ME TO PAY TO SHIP IT TO THEM IN NEW JERSEY AND PAY FOR THE PACKAGE AND THE POSTAGE! I DONT THINK THAT IS RIGHT WHEN IT'S THEIR TOY THAT IS MESSED UP. I CANT EVEN TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE I BOUGHT IT CAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE. I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BETTER WARRANTIES FOR THESE KIND OF TOYS. I RAISE MY DAUGHTER TO TAKE CARE OF HER THINGS AND I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD SUFFER CAUSE PEOPLE DONT MAKE THE STUFF LIKE THEY SHOULD."
3,Frustrated 5 year old,I find that my daughter and I are having the same problems as many. The scanner is not only hard for her to use but me as well. If you don't line it up and scan slow it doesn't work. You have to do it again and again. Shutting off in the middle of the shopping list is also very annoying.It is very durable. It is also very loud on the low setting. My daughter and I have repeatedly played with this toy only to end up walking away mad! My daughter is 5 and has no disabilities. [...] thought to be a fun toy turned out to be such a frustrating disappointment.
4,Great Toy!,"I just bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She had been asking for it for weeks since she saw it on a TV commercial. I brought it home and put it together and immediately we both fell in love with it! It scans the 20+ items in the cart via barcode or you can manually punch in the 3-digit item numbers from the shopping guide. The scanner works wonderfully (first time, every time) and it is great entertainment for my daughter. Definately a great gift for any child who loves to play store!!"
3,Comments on Barbie Cart,"My 4 year old little girl got this from santa this year. She loves the cart but the items are REALLY hard to scan even for me, so it is great as just a cart but they should have made it easier for the little hands trying to do it. If you lift the scanner off the item for a split second it doesn't read anything. The overall toy rating is good just take into account it could get frustrating for some children."
3,Great for B-D class players,"Typical Reinfeld simplicity and clarity, but misses many critical and important lines. Fun and beneficial to most, but Grandmaster through A class players shouldn't expect a high level treatment here."
5,Classic Gloria Estefan: The 1991 World Tour DVD,"In her triumphant return following a tragic bus accident in 1990, a fully recuperated Gloria Estefan embarked on an ambitious world concert tour showcasing her latest album: ""Into the Light.""All in all, based upon my viewing of the VHS version, this fantastic compliation is a vibrant, 90-minute concert highlight reel of Gloria's Miami Sound Machine from the European portion of the tour, including her poignant rendition of the inspirational ""Coming Out of the Dark.""Rating: 10/10 (Outstanding!) -- Hopefully, this DVD will again ""see the light"" someday.P.S. As a companion piece for Gloria's fans, there is also out there a prequel out-of-release VHS, ""Coming Out of the Dark,"" which insightfully focuses on Gloria's lengthy recuperation and her spirited, behind-the-scenes preparation for the Into the Light project (including music videos and the tour). If you can still find it, it's really a gem!"
1,never got never got refunded,"I have every Jeff Healey CD except this one, so I can't tell you if it's any good as the third party vendor was extremely late compared to everything else I ordered at the same time and then could never produce the CD... All the other Jeff Healey CD's except ""With Friends"" are great blues and I consider them a must have... I couldn't figure out how to get Amazon to resolve the 3rd party refund issue... All the 3rd party wanted to do was sub in other CD's none of which I have ever heard of... The whole process makes me unsettled about dealing with a third party through Amazon"
5,cymbal cleaner,the product works very well. the supplier sent the product very quickly and it arrived in good condition. Thank you
4,good! not perfect!,"this thing really works and really cleans your cymbals!! the problem is that it changes the color of your cymbals a little!if you're using gold cymbals, the color might turn to something like silver!but over all it's a good product!"
1,Never get these. Their bad.,"I had the Zildjian el sonido 17"", it was beautiful gold color, when i cleaned it ended up silver/whiter. Plus 2 days later it has a strange color. I have also noticed that the sound is not the same. It takes some weight away from the cymbal...making it a little bit trashier...Don't buy these..their awful."
1,would not recomend,"I have been using Brasso metal polish for a long time, 10+ years, and it doesn't take the metal off my cymbals like this stuff does. This ""polish"" when wiped off the cymbal puts a metalic sheen on the cloth, unlike Brasso. The sheen disturbed me, as I don't want my cymbals metal taken off, thats part of its sound. I will go back to Brasso, I will not recommend this Zildjian Cymbal Cleaning Polish to anyone."
2,I hate to be negative but......,"I really wanted to eat this book up, but found the style to be half baked and the plot reminiscent of separated mayonnaise. ( If I wanted bad cooking I would have stayed in my OWN kitchen!)But most annoying was the waxed fruit basket of women that stirred the attentions our Gourmet Detective. Silky Syllabub or stodgy Bread and Butter Pudding depending on the breast size and/or leg length. Save it for the chickens.I shall not be Spiced to Death."
2,Could have used some more time in the oven,"The detail about the food and food triva gets it an extra star, but I'm not foodie enough to overlook the thin characters, incomprehensible plot, or meandering narrative style. If you really are that into gourmet cooking, there are many non-fiction books that will provide the research without forcing you to wade through a so-called detective story. Skip this one."
2,Too Many Cooks Spoil the Soup,"Of interest to gourmets and wine-bibbers, this however has far too many personalities to be kept in mind when considering who-dunnit. Perhaps furtner entries in the series might pare the cast of characters, but I won't be following up. It was pleasant that the mystery-reading viewpoint character amusedly compared himself, to his detriment, to fictional detectives of fame."
4,very encouraging,"I love working with these tapes. I was so afraid that I would be intimidated by these ""atheletes"" on the box, but they are very encouraging. It might be nice if they went into more detail about the mechanics of the poses and breathing, but these tapes are not for beginners."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, and have most of his recordings. Although, I was disappointed in the performances & song selections by some of the divas on this album, I could never be disappointed with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's selection."
1,A Waste of Money,"I had one of these on my 7.5 HP Outboard which was on the transom of my fishing boat.I say ""had,"" because the scumbag who stole this motor pried it off with a tire iron. And from the look of it, there didn't seem to be a whole lot of effort put into breaking it. He was nice enough to leave me the broken lock and the tire iron.It's been said before that if someone really wants your outboard they're going to figure out a way to steal it.But I don't think this piece of junk even slowed the thief down."
1,Outboard Motor Lock,"My neighbor had this securing his outboard to his boat. Thieves cut the end opposite the lock with a pair of wire cutters and slid it off. By the looks of it, it took them very little effort to steal his motor. I wouldn't buy one of these, it is not a serious anti-theft device."
1,Will not protect your motor,Somebody took a crowbar and as it looked with little effort pried this open and stole my motor. Waste of money.
3,Average Protection,"This outboard engine lock is of decent quality in my opinion. The steel channel is nothing more than just that. It is of medium strength. It fit my 9.9 HP Mercury just fine. You get what you pay for and this lock priced at about sixteen dollars is fair. Like many security items, this will ""keep and honest man honest"" but not protect against a determined thief."
2,More from the same,"What great difference between from these weaks and partials works of ""history"" and the memoirs of those who were on (allieds or not) on Italian front, most of these works first printed on 1960's or those made by academics.Anyway is essential to Anyone who take this subject seriously read many fonts as possible not just wrote by whiteamericans, but black too as japanese descendents and of course from other nationalities involved on the question like Germans, British, Poles, Brazilians, Italians etc etc"
3,There's a better guide for Senegal and Gambia!,"As an avid birder living in Senegal, I had seen a guide to birds of Senegal and Gambia in the hands of a local ornithologist and fell in love. Unfortunately I hadn't counted on there being two distinct Helm guides to birds of Senegal and Gambia. The Borrow and Demey guide is MUCH better - way more pictures, all species pictured (some are not pictured in this guide), three times as many color plates, and a great deal more pictures of females and immatures to assist with identification. Birds in this guide are crammed into only 48 plates and sometimes drawn somewhat amateurishly. I'll have to pawn this one off on an unsuspecting friend. :)"
3,A field guide to Birds of the Gambia and Senegal,The format of this book is sub standard to the field guides we are used to in South Africa i.e. Newmans and Sasol.I could not review the layout of the pages prior to purchasing and was disappointed to find that the outdated plate system was used. Plate layouts work for leisure review but NOT a field guide where all info needs to be on the fingertips and distribution maps being one critical element.
3,I hate when bad endings and stories happen to good characters :-(,"I agree with Sugar Can Jane in terms of this book having interesting characters, but deserving a FAR better book. It was an easy, light read and I'd recommend it, HOWEVER, it's extremely fluffy and the ending was really corny and it felt rushed, like they gave her two days to come up with something, so she typed up a random ending that did not fullfill the book's implicit promise."
2,"Gushy, but nothing new","Rather uninspired writing. OK as a read if you want a superficial timepass chick lit saga set in the Bollywood backstage, but not really anything worth spending time on."
5,The best symphony written.,"This is the best symphony written. The whole symphony hangs together, unlike some where the composer shows a different side of himself with each part. A powerful delight. And this is the best recordrd rendition, ( Ihave listened to four different renditions), The New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein."
5,Wonderful and shocking,"I LOVED this book! It got slow in a few parts but the ending is so shocking that it will leave you begging for more. Wow, totally suggest you read it."
4,A Romance - Really?,"I was truly surprised at the title, after reading this book. I would highly recommend it as it was really really interesting. This was a fast read and hard to put down. Very suspenseful and well written. I also gained a better knowledge of the monastic/convent life."
5,Fun book,"If you are in to Gothic literature, this book is a must read. It is fantastic and tragic! I really enjoyed reading this, so much so that, despite its large size, I read it in two days."
1,Ugh,"This book could have been a decent read, but it drones on and on and on. I don't even want to give it a more indepth review as I don't think it's worth my time, just as reading this book (for my book club selection) was a waste of my time."
1,Not my style.,"Written too old school I guess, not my style of writting. I couldn't get started on it really to enjoy it. I kept putting it down and never coming back."
4,Start with Paolo,This is an excellent read for adult educators that want a series of practical ideas and ways to enable transformation in adult education. To really get at the heart of transformation and its challenges. I suggest reading Paolo Friere's Pedagogy of the Oppressed and get a sense of the ideas of Liberation Theology and the context for Friere's 'dialogical man' before reading this text. The poltical commentary was hardly touched on in this book and engaging in social transformation without taking a poltical position needs deeper consideration because of the risks involved for the educator.
3,Stockings wont stay up,"The stockings are very cute, however, they just wont stay up. Normal stockings fall down a bit, but these seem to fall so many inches down the leg is not worth it. They dont have enough hold at the top of the stocking, so it becomes very frustrating. They dont look near as good in person as on the model. The colors are true to what you see, and the size seems true to fit."
5,Elvis Topper Ball,"I got this for my best friend, who is an Elvis Freak. She loved it! Looks good, even now, when its been on the antenna for over 6 months."
4,How resistance recreates the conditions of alienation,"Paul Willis follows the lives of a group of rebellious working-class boys in an industrial city in England, from their hijinks in and out of the classroom during their last year of high school, to their first year of working-class jobs on the factory floor. In the process, he discovers how the material reality -- that better jobs do not exist for most of them, even if they conform to the middle-class values espoused by their teachers -- combines with both working-class values and the boys' search for autonomy, to reproduce the boys as the next generation of the working class. The one weak point is a heavy use of Marxist jargon in the analytical section; however, the ethnographic detail is excellent, and the book's conclusion raises disturbing questions about the reproduction of poverty in Western countries: the schools which we believe are the agents of social mobility in fact serve to perpetuate divisions of wealth and opportunity."
3,Good - but bad...,"I have owned 6 of the Andromeda lighters so far. Why 6? Because they don't last more then 6 months, if that long. I LOVE the design of the lighter, and I love the lighting action, while the lighter is new. However, they seem to be under engineered. The lighting system starts to fail at 2 or 3 months, with complete failure inside of 6 months.I have returned 3 of the lighters under the warranted rules, only to have Colibri simply rework them instead of replace them. None of the lighters worked more then a few weeks after repair.Don't get me wrong - I still love the Andromeda, however I purchase them as a disposable product, seeking the best deals, knowing I will be replacing it inside of 6 months."
4,"Good, but dry.....","I agree with most of what the other reviewers are saying, but I found it a bit dry, and somewhat frightening if anyone reading it was just diagnosed with HIV; flipping through it can fill you with ""doom and gloom""....."
1,Few problems,"I never recieved my package. There was no tracking number so we can't find it. They never sent a message saying it was sent, nor was there a follow up. It was supposed to have been here February 4th at the latest, but it never showed. I sent an email on the 9th only for them to say it must've been ""lost in the mail"". I still have not recieved it and can hope I can find another book because I will not have this book for my test. They did give me a full refund and were polite in the email. It is very frustrating to wait for a package that never shows."
1,Misses the Mark!,"The author is clearly an expert on Sherpas, having lived and studied among them as an anthropologist for over 40 years. She writes this book for the layman in a form of anthropoligical study. She misses the mark both in terms of layman interest, and in terms of an enlighting anthropoligical study. Ms. Ortner looks at several facets of Sherpa life with a view toward how and why Sherpas became involved in mountaineering. It was clear to me, despite all the research and academia, the answer as to how and why remains perfectly clear and not too profound. Carrying loads, establishing camps, and fixing ropes provide the Sherpa with an extremely high income (relative to their society), allowing the climbers to provide greater comfort and a better standard of living for themselves and their families. I was very disappointed in this particular book, and I do not recommend it as a means of insight into the Sherpas."
4,"Standers Safety Bed Rail 30""","I am very happy with the product. Was not quite sure how to secure the straps to the box springs on the adjustable bed, and still not completely sure I did it right, but overall it is just what I needed. I can now lay on my side instead of being flat of my back all the time without having to worry about falling out of bed. The only other problem other than the install is the rail seems to have moved further down along side of the bed than where it was placed originally. Not sure if it is due to my install or if it is due to the fact that it is an adjustable bed, and perhaps that when I raise the bed it moves the rail slightly each time. If anyone has any suggestions for me I would be greatful."
3,Arrived black - not silver as shown,"I thought I was purchasing a silver bed rail, and it arrived black. I was given no color choice, and think that is not cool at all. If there were a color choice, it definitely should have been given at the time of purchase. Otherwise, OK."
1,Not for Sleep Number Beds!,"This product might have worked out fine but my mother has a sleep number bed that has the mattress attached to the boxspring. You can't install this bed rail without lifting the mattress up, so it didn't work with her bed. I had to return it and order a different one. The new one worked out much better! It was also a Standers rail, but didn't have the strap that you attach around the boxspring."
4,"30"" Bed Rail","I received this product in excellent condition. It was easy to assemble and have enjoyed having it. I could not get it around my bed rail, but feel very protected using it as is. I purchased this bed rail at Amazon.com.pmm"
3,"It works, but not easily","This bedrail was somewhat difficult to install. It does serve the function for which it was designed, but because it is awkward for the person in bed to put the side down when he needs to get out of bed, he is rarely using it. We bought itbecause he had rolled out of bed while sleeping once. Fortunately, that hasn't happened again, but we really need to find a rail that can be more easily lowered by a person lying in the bed."

1,Learn HTML 4 IN a Weekenr 4th edition,"As a dislexic computer user I will not be able to use this publication.I need instructions in colour and well spaced, laid out in an imaginative manor. What can I do, could I return this book as I found it impossible to understand how to begin to use it? It is not user friendly for those with this learning difficulty."
2,Misleading age range,"This book has a lot of good ideas, but many of the activities were not appropriate for this age group."
5,I am satisfied with it,"This case marches the color of my camera,and it is good in quality. My friends who have seen it like it too. I think I have made the right chioce."
3,Could Be Better,"It is a nice clean looking case, but if you are looking to carry an extra battery or a memory stick, be prepared for a tight squeeze. The case seems to be designed to hold only the camera, even the pictures on the back indicate that the leash should stick out of the case when the camera is placed inside. Good camera case if you wanted something to protect your camera, but if you planned on carring some extra accessories, you might want to get something else."
4,Great Carrying Case,"Is too lihgt, beautiful and good color....but i thing much better is coming whith additional pocket.."
3,Sony LCS-NB Soft Carry Case,"The carrying case is sturdy and does the job. The only function it lapses is that you cannot put the neck carrying strap on the case. Overall, it's a good deal for the price."
2,Thumbs down,"Good story line, but too much violence and profanity. Never did watch Empire. Prefer movies that's wholesome and positive. I wasted my money."
4,"excellent as a compression garment, if you're cold","My doctor recommended this item as a compression garment after my surgery. Unfortunately, it was in the heat of summer and I really only needed something for my abdomen. This item was very hot on my legs. Tried cutting off the legs but, you guessed it, that old pantyhose thing happened...... the cut edges rolled up and created a line under my clothes ....so, I threw it away and got the high-waisted brief version."
2,You're Better Off With Control-Top Pantyhose!,"I'm quite disappointed. I don't know what I was expecting...something with a little more ""oomph,"" perhaps? These are like control-top pantyhose with the legs cut off. They truly don't hold in a thing. They're also very hard to pull up since they're high-waisted; mine are so high-waisted that they come up past the bottom of my bra, and not being double-jointed, it's hard to pull it up to the middle of my back! You need to get it smooth across your back or you'll have this horrid-looking roll that spoils the whole concept of a smooth line. Trust me, you're better off buying a pair of control-tops - they're a heck of a lot cheaper. These are apparently for thin women without an ounce of flab (I am neither)who just want a smooth silhouette."
5,"CLEAR, BASIC, BUT NOT ELEMENTARY","As someone who understands how difficult it can be to try to paint with watercolors, I must say that this book was one of the most helpful that I have found in terms of providing clear technique suggestions, a well organized approach, and interesting text. Often basic watercolor books are too simplistic. The illustrations in this book give you something to aspire to. The color reproductions of Catherine's own work are exquisite. The chapter entitled IS THIS A MISTAKE OR A CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY? spoke directly to me and my consistent insecurities in my work. Catherine's dictum that ""mistakes are gifts"" is a message I am trying to integrate into my art. The whale story in the introduction and the sidebars are very inspirational and you might even say spiritual. And . . . I am now painting watercolors with no more fear. Thank you Catherine Anderson."
5,An inspirational book!,"Catherine Anderson sets out in this book to inspire you from page one! She herself is an incerdible artist, but the book brings to light that she is an incredible person and teacher too."
3,"Great book, poor translation","This book is a great source of information. Comprehensive, thoroughly illustrated and graphically appealing. It is a shame the translation is a poor job. I am a translator and a potter and I am new to craft glass. I'm sure I'll use this book a lot, but I really wish it hadn't been translated from Spanish, because the English rendition is definitely not good."
1,...,"I found the claims of the authors odd. It is simply not true that this is ""the first and only full-color book on the subject of ""warm,"" or kiln-fired, glass in print"". There are several. The one considered the ""standard"" by most kiln-formers is the book by Brad Walker by the same title. Walker's book is both comprehensive, and lavishly and clearly illustrated. [...]I hope folks who are seriously interested in learning about kiln-working glass will take a look at Brad Walker's book. It is more expensive than this [one], but worth every cent. It is the best resource I have seen on the craft and art of kiln-working glass."
2,Limited usefulness,"I bought this book at a bookstore as the photography was nice. Once I got it home and read it closely, I discovered it is mostly focused on float glass and isn't very useful if you want to use Bullseye or Spectrum glasses. I promptly returned it to the bookstore. There are much better beginning books out there."
3,basic but a good reference,If you are just starting out in the world of glass this is a great place to look. You will find many basic projects that will introduce you to glass. Just don't expect too much beyond that.
4,Better than Most,"This book is actually better than most glass books, giving information avbout fusing and casting that actually helps to fire correctly. It also has beautiful, if a bit dated, photos."
5,Great Book,"Absolutely Great! This is the best book I've read on fusing too date and I read alot. Instead of just ""what to do"", it explains why you are doing it. It has a wonderful history of glass and an excellent explanation on the nature of glass. It covers the full range of information for working with warm glass, from straight fusing to making your own molds for casting."
2,Glass working for the craft enthusiast,"A beautiful book but not for the beginning craft enthusiast who is interested in getting into glass working. While itis well illustrated with beautiful pictures, it lacks instructions for those who are not knowledgeable about glass working."
4,good eye candy with tech stuff too!,friend likes eye candy to motivate but needs technical info to actually make pieces and we got that. Thanks!
5,book about glass,"All I knew about glass, is that I like it. I wondered if it is a hobby I could every try. This book explains it all. It was fun and very clearly written. nice pictures. Arrived in 2 days from amazon. Wow they are fast."
5,Great book to read to our young children,"We found the book beautifully written and illustrated. It is legendary as well as factual, but his life is presented in a most touching and informative way."
1,Too simple,The book was too basic. I was expecting something more knowleagable. It was a waste of money. It didn't seem to have investigation involved on writting the book.
4,book order,I( was very satisfied with the ease of ordering and the promptness of delivery...will order again...
4,Crumbling Dominant Images of Japan's Economy,"I am a former student of Prof. Roberson. He is an interesting and enthusiastic teacher. One will find this evidenced in his case study of a Japanese small business. As he mentions in his opening passage, much of research and focus on Japanese businesses has been on the large corporations known to many Americans. It is not very well known that these popular companies provide a very small percentage of employment in Japan compared to the several small and medium sized companies. His research focuses on one such small business, Shintani Metals. He takes the reader to a step by step focus on various aspects of worker life both in and out of the job. It is a very clearly written work and a worthwhile read for those with interests in Japan."
5,a wonderful dvd,"if you are a fan of the statler brothers, or gospel music this is a must have. i now have both part 1 and part 2. well worth the money. they are both GREAT. you will not regret ording these."
2,Didn't Fit,"This must be more ideal for a handgun. The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15, Remington 12 gauge, nor my Reuger .22. The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger, however, when I tried that, I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun. The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved. I should have returned it, but I was lazy."
2,Keep the receipt,"I recently bought this for my 6 and 3 year old. (And for me too.) Everyone was very excited about being able to see themselves on the tv and play games too. The game was easy enough to set up, but that is where the positive attributes end.We had 3 lights on in the room we were in, and could barely see my daughter. Then we took it to another room where the lighting is even better with no better results. The picture quality was very poor and we could not get more than one game to play. Thank goodness I kept the receipt. We returned it the next day. I think this could be a really great game but it needs some work. Very disappointed!"
4,A great little workout!,"I originally saw this On Regis & Kelly as well, but was hesitiant to fork up the $$ for it. Then we found it at Wal-Mart on clearance for $25, so we *had* to get it! Hooked it up right away, which was super easy. We don't have an issue with lighting at all & all we have is a ceiling fan light. My 6 year old & I enjoyed it very much. The balloon juggle is by far the best of the 4 games.He & I got a great little workout & had a blast laughing as we found new ways to bump the balloons. We used our heads, elbows, knees, bottoms, etc... I could only give it 4 stars though, because we may have to return/exchange ours. After 20 minutes of play, the TV picture developed static lines and the lines play the game for you. The balloons hit the lines & go back up. We turned it off, then back on & started all over & the lines disappeared, but returned after just 10 minutes. Hmmm..."
1,"GoGO TV, Not So Great","My 7 year old daughter recieved this toy for Christmas and was very excited because the graphics looked so good on the box. The installation is easy, but you basically need flood lighting to be able to see yourself on TV. The kids enjoy the games and they do get them moving, but switching from game to game is difficult nad the kids got frustrated and gave up after half an hour. Definately not worth the $60 bucks I paid for it. Will be returning this gift to the store."
1,Terribly disappointed,"My 5-year old begged for this for Christmas, only to be disappointed by the difficulty in getting the games started and changing to other games that he wanted to play. He gave up after 10 minutes. The picture is terrible...you can barely see the player. Big waste of money. ""Santa"" took it back to the store."
5,Best Xmas Gift!!! Truly Unique!,I found this game on Amazon while shoppig for Xmas gifts for my 9 year old twin girls. They haven't stopped playing with it since it was opened Xmas day! AND IT GOT THEM SO EXHAUSTED THEY HAD TO TAKE A NAP! What a great gift! Simple to set up and you're up and running in minutes. I will definitely buy the other game cartridges for this product! Please keep designing more games for this system! My girls love it!
1,Waste of money,Bought it for my grand sons 7 and 8 yrs. old. Didn`t work well. We hooked it up and they didn`t like it. Threw it away already.
4,Good speaker at a great price!,I've had these on my patio for 4 years. I leave them out year round.They still sound great!
4,"Fun to read about the TRUTH, that is FREE, and WITHIN us","I've now read six books about urine therapy. This book by Dr. Mithal is fun to read, because it is written in a broken English, as would be spoken in India. I loved the anecdote about the doctors in India who believe in urine-therapy, but know that their patients won't drink their own urine. So when the patient comes in for a visit, the doctor asks for a urine sample, which is then taken to a back room, and artificially colored and flavored, and repackaged as medicine. The doctor tells the patient to drink the medicine, and the patient invariably gets well. Mithal writes that such behavior should be forgiven because without which the patients would not get well. This is a short book. Our own human urine appears to be the long-sought FOUNTAIN of YOUTH."
4,"very aggressive, but loads up in pine","In a small angle grinder, these discs are really aggressive, and are just what you need to get a lot of stuff off fast. But I used it to smooth a pine sculpture, and it loaded up like crazy. For such highly loading materials, I'd recommend stearate paper instead, which doesn't load as fast, but wears out faster."
2,"Beware, Leaves One Out!","It is so typical for soundtracks lately to leave out the best songs or scores of the film. This one is no exception! I very much wanted to hear the song that plays over the opening credits and the ""Congressional Recruitment"" scene. It is omitted from this otherwise great soundtrack. Studios need to start including all major works from films to make whole a ""soundtrack."""
1,HORRIBLE...,"This cd should be burned at the stake! I'm insulted by these utterly childish and soul-less remixes! The opening track sounds like it was done by a third grader on a casio. The drum loop is a joke! I have to say that this may be the worst cd I have ever purchased! Don't get me wrong because I love Todd Rundgren but these remixes are a blatant insult to the originals. Why couldn't have Todd picked more capable remixers? I, myself could have done a better job remixing these tracks. So take my word...DON'T BUY THIS...!!!!!!!!!"
4,reconstructed,"Todd purists will hate this compilation and who can blame them? Most Todd heads are in their late 40's and early 50's. This re-tooled Todd collection is not designed for you. It is fun and whimsical and shows that Todd still has a sense of humor. This will grow on you the same way ""With a Twist"" did. As with any other Todd project after ""Nearly Human"", half the songs are cool and the other half are hard to listen to, the thing is the fans can't agree on which half is which."
2,A lackluster Minutemen album,"No matter how many times I listen to this--and try to like it--in the end, it just sounds like a really weak Minutemen album. Of course, the worst Minutemen album is still better than lots of other stuff you could listen to. But strip this down to ""Down With The Bass,"" ""Walking the cow,"" ""Flying the Flannel,"" and ""Anti-Misogyny Maneuver,"" because I'm guessing that's all you'll ever want to listen to twice."
4,Good movie - SHould be in U.S. DVD format!!,"I have this movie on VHS tape, but wish it would be put in a U.S DVD format. THis movie was made in 1954 and is based on a short story by Mark Twain. Gregory Peck plays a penniless American sailor lucky enough to be passing the house of two rich British men. They offer the sailor a loan in the form of a single banknote in the amount of one MILLION POUNDS. The sailor finds that whenever he tries to spend it, no one is able to make change, therefore they let him have whatever he desires on account, assuming that he is a very wealthy man. Ultimately, the money turns out to be more of a curse than a blessing. It has a good ending.As I said, I wish this movie would be put on DVD for Region 1. It seems like foreign countries are luckier than the United States in having these great, old movies put on DVD. Wish our movie distributors would get on the ball and let us see these wonderful movies, too!"
3,Bought the movie for a friend,"Was purchased for a friend; we did not have option to watch it, because they said they had ordered the wrong format for our region; it came as advertized, though, like new!"
1,"This version might be a hit in China, BUT...!","I have always loved this movie, a story based on a Mark Twain writing. I saw it last on TV years ago and wanted to get a copy for myself and for the college film class I teach. The DVD sucks! The color is off just enough to to be irritating and the initial recording is in Chinese! While you can change the language, the dubbing is off....lips moving, no words or words and people just standing there. Unless you want to waste several dollars, I would not buy this knock off copy. I did find a very scarce VHS copy which restored my sanity. I should say the purchase of the ""Chinese version"" wasn't all bad, my students got a good laugh and a lesson in purchasing DVDs."
4,Floyd Cramer CD,We had a cassette of this old Floyd Cramer tape and wanted a CD. We like it alot. The CD was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape. Very pleased. Thank you.
1,This ink clogged my printer,"After printing a few pages with one of these cartridges my Canon i320 became unusable. Every print request was stopped with the message: ""Print head not installed! Install the print head in the printer and click OK."" I took out the print head and cleaned out the excess ink, but to no avail. My trusty i320 is now ruined."
5,Intellectual masterpiece,"The petrified Forest is an intellectual tale with all the drama and excitement to whet anyone's appetite. The play takes place in an isolated cafe on the edge of the petrified forest, a symbol for the dying intellectual man. All the main characters are in some way a part of this tradition; the tradition of dying breeds-the outlaw, the dreamer, and the disilluioned intellectual. A fabulous play in every respect."
4,The Last Film from Tennessee Williams,"Well, until ""Not About Nightingales"" makes it to the screen, ""Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots"" will be the last of original, never-before-filmed Tennessee Williams scripts. Some parts of this movie are so slow, but the images are timeless. James Coburn descending the stairs in a wedding dress, Lynn Redgrave winning on a TV game show, the flooding of the Mississippi delta are all hard-wired in my mind. After this 1969 Lumet film, only retreds of older Williams scripts ensue. Critics of the play ""Kingdom of Earth"" complain that it is so derivative of earlier material that neither the play nor the subsequent film version are sucessful. I tend to agree with the previous writer from Australia--the movie is subversive in the best sense of the word. Like the flood, it will creep up on you and change the way you see some things in your life, forever."
4,As described,Jacket is a good chinese copy of the jungle fatigues I was issued decades ago. But not a true copy. The elbows are not reinforced and the jacket is not for hot weather use for example. The cotton blend is soft and comfortable. However they are not going to be very durable in the field as the original issue jacket. Aso once wet will take time to dry. overall a good item and pleased with the purchase. I gave it 4 stars due to the material itself not being very durable.
3,vietnam fatigue shirt,"the shirt is correctly styled, but is of slightly lighter weight than my original issue VN ripstop shirt. in addition the color is more gray than the original green issue shirts. but as i foolishly gave away about a dozen sets after returning from VN, this shirt w/ matching pants are the best repros i could find to wear in parades, school presentations, etc."
4,"This album is ""99%"" good.","Even though ""Soul Asylum"" had a different sound before, and many albums before this one, ""Grave Dancer's Union"" was their big break. Not only did it hit during the peak of the grunge years, but it was also well written, and had many hits. Included is ""Somebody To Shove"", ""Black Gold"", and the huge hit ""Runaway Train"". I also really like ""Homesick"", ""Without A Trace"", and the gentle ""Sun Maid"". It's hard to say if this is their best, but it's definitely their most popular, and as good as most others in the genre. They also have released a 19 track ""Best Of""."
1,Disappointing should've fired the producer,"After owning ""And the Horse they rode in on,"" which was a great album, I was very disappointed in Soul Asylum's output on this CD. I felt as if the producer must have kept telling them in the studio, ""Let's try it one more time, and slow it down a little."" Despite this being their ""breakthrough"" (ie: commercially successful) album, it's not very engaging."
4,Soul Asylum Is Awesome!!!,"Soul Asylum is awesome!!! this is their second best album behind ""let your dim light shine"" although i think their best song ever is on this album--Runaway Train. I love this album!!! The songs range from a mellow rock like Runaway Train, to heavy rock like 99%. i love this album. great stuff. get it if u don't have it. it's worth it."
4,Strong Breakthrough Album,"Until the release of ""Grave Dancer's Union,"" Soul Asylum looked fated to labor fruitlessly in the wilderness like fellow Minneapolis rockers The Replacements. That all changed with the 1991 Nirvana revolution and ""Union,"" thanks to some excellent songwriting and a way-overplayed hit single. ""Runaway Train,"" is that single, a throwback to a 1980s power ballad. Fortunately, the album also contained the punkish single ""Somebody to Shove,"" and a storytelling single in ""Black Gold."" The rest of the material alternates between rockers as ballads, with highlights such as the catchy refrain of ""Keep it Up,"" the nostalgic ""Homesick,"" ""Without a Trace,"" and a superb closing track in ""The Sun Maid.""Overall, Soul Asylum's breakthrough album is one of the better things to follow in the wake of Nirvana in the early 1990s."
4,Minnesota rocks,"GRAVE DANCERS UNION vaulted Soul Asylum to previously unattainable heights of popularity. Their first effort for Columbia Records after years of neglect from A&M Records. Rhetoric doesn't do justice in describing the vast package here. Quite simply, Soul Asylum is/was? a great rock and roll band with an expanse of tastes, influences and styles. All are effective when applied to their own songs. ""Somebody To Shove,"" ""Black Gold"" and ""Runaway Train"" are as different as three songs can get. They are also as great as three songs can get. The totally awesome Replacements tried but not enough of you paid attention. The torch as Minnesota's next great band was passed to Soul Asylum."
4,Too bad it didn't last.,"Soul Asylum were one of the last great songwriting bands. They have several albums that came before this one that were also great (check out ""And The Horse They Rode In On""), but after only two more subsequent releases (the great ""Let Your Dim Light Shine"" and the decent follow-up ""Candy From A Stranger""), they just sort of disappeared.This album is just great though. Superb song crafting, versatile styles. Great break from the hair bands and pissed-at-success grungers that were dominating the scene at the time."
3,this is going to hurt me a lot more than...,"i hate to give this such a mediocre rating, because i really like these guys, and ""runaway train"" is one of my favorite singles of all time (one of like, four cassette singles i ever bought). i was super excited to hear this album again after so long, but when i did, i knew i should have been smart enough to let the memories work their magic. i had to face it, except for a very few glimpses of something more, soul asylum was a second-tier grunge band. the fact that they were from minneapolis helped a bit with their atmosphere and energy, but they just never really got a handle on what they were trying to do. except on ""runaway train,"" of course...which, if you haven't heard, is alone worth the price of admission."
2,Cherub rock,"Their sound is one of the best examples of Nineties indie alt-rock, and, especially for those that were twenty-somethings around '92, this is fun. ""Somebody to Shove"" is a gem, or at least fool's gold. ""Black Gold"" and ""Runaway Train"" offer charmingly puerile entertainment. The others have great melodies and hackneyed lyrics that ensure them nice pyrite thrones in celebration of their irrefutable pop-corn status. And there's nothing wrong with that."
5,Thrilling prose,"This book puts the thrill back in thriller. Not only is it edge-of-the-seat exciting, but the prose...just plain beautiful. One memorable image after another. I sure hope Jones brings back Jim Doe in a future book. I'll be watching for it."
3,Creepy premise with preposterous plot!,"This book was highly praised by some critics but I found it creepy and sometimes preposterous. The ""Tin Man"" is a serial killer being hunted by FBI and law enforcement officials all over the east coast and midwest. The book is plenty long, but nowhere did I find a means for him to finance these extravagant journeys across the US to snatch Indian children out of the rubble of tornadoes (and he maintained three separate homes!) There is also not enough family background presented in the plot to justify how he turned into such a monster. It was hard to keep the places and victims straight, and besides the protagonist Jim Doe, I really didn't feel I could empathize with many of the characters. It's well-written for the most part, but sometimes the prose was purposefully disjointed."
1,who kiddin who?,"ok, so i am somewhat skilled in writing and the use of english as a first language, but this book beat me down. by the third-quarter i gave up and stopped reading. irrelevant is the ending, simply because i did not understand the book from the beginning. while 'ulysses' is not the type of material i enjoy still i made valiant efforts to decipher characters and plot but oh well, guess the butler did it?"
2,Not Worth Your Money...,"I dont think this CD is all that because I only liked 1 song, track 3, the rest of them are too deep for me, I'm an old school techno lover, so I will say if you like new age Techno, then you will love this CD!!!"
4,Great Movie and DVD,"This movie is a great independent feature. The cast is outstanding, including the young star. The movie follows a young boy through an abusive father and tough neighboorhood. The DVD contains a insightfull commentary on getting the movie made and also good independent tips. It also analyzes what I consider the best scene in the movie."
5,A Dark Tale with a Bright Heart,"A stunning, underrated film about the fragility of boys as represented by Joe Henry. Whaley shows amazing control and subtlety. Even the smallest details resound. Though things seems hopeless for the protagonist, the fact that the movie is based on the director's own life and he transcended those circumstances give it a kind of brightness and optimism despite the surface bleakness of the material. Wonderful performances, beautifully-shot, sparingly but powerfully written."
3,Disappointing...,"Although it evokes some emotion for the main character, this movie lacks a climax. It just kind of has the same pace and mood throughout."
3,Depressing movie,"""Joe the King"" is a depressing story about a boy who grows up in a poor family. Joe goes to a local school where most of his classmates make fun of him because his dad is the school janitor. Joe stands up for himself, his brother, his mother, and even his dad even though they all treat him 'average'. In the end, Joe turns to crime to help his family.""Joe the King"" is not a movie for everyone. Some viewers may find the movie depressing, disturbing and even offensive. There is a substantial amount of profanity in the movie. If you insist on viewing it, be sure to rent it first."
2,"Beware, it rusts FAST!","The product fits the hitch just fine and has an excellent price point, unfortunately it rusts extremely quickly. In less than 3 weeks it was all spotty. After 3 months it is almost completely covered in rust, the worst part being that despite the rubber cap, the lock is rusted shut. We will have to cut off the lock and buy a better product, or cover the new one in some rust proofer."
5,Does the job !,Easy to install and safely secures my bike rack the receiver hitch. Dust cover keeps debris out of the key slot. (Useful feature).
2,Ok,"Worked as it was supposed to but after the first winter, I guess salt somehow got past the cover and I couldnt get it unlocked, will not buy another one of these as long as I live somewhere where it snows."
1,would not fit,this would not fit the swagman bike carrier the carrier needs a threaded lock this one was solid
3,Good Lock but doesnt fit Swagman Bike Rack,"Buyer beware!! - If you are buying this lock to pair with the Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2-Inch Reciever) as recommended by Amazon; don't! I purchased the rack and hitch lock together in July 08 based on Amazons recommendation. Apparently, Swagman changed their design mid-year to a proprietary threaded hitch pin and a standard 5/8"" slide in hitch lock no longer fits the bike rack."
1,Important will not work on Swagman bike rack,"Amazon recommended this as part of my order of the swagman bike carrier. I did not read the reviews from other people before I bought this lock for the carrier. It will not fit at all with the swagman. As I write this, Amazon still has not removed it from its recommeded list for this bike carrier. Do not add it if you plan to buy this carrier which by the way, wonderfull bike rack for my truck."
3,It's ok,It was pretty rusty after about a week but you can hardly notice it on my truck...does the job fine.
2,Rusts Immediately,The lock itself is good but the quality of the metal is definitely not. It began to rust almost immediately and now the entire lock is covered in rust and looks horrible. Better off getting a different one.
5,good conddition,"game works fine, needed a little bit of cartridge love, i.e. blowing, inserting a few times and multiple flicks of the power switch to get the game to boot."
2,Wailliae is better,"In my humble opinion Wailliae golf for the N64 is the best golf game out there right now. This game has great graphics and neat additions but it sacrificed too much for the cute factor. Buy the aforementioned golf game, you will not be sorry."
5,Fun!,This game is great. I'm looking forward to the Tennis cousin of this game cuz this game has got real golf play (not what you think). This game is real bub. Its also got some excellent charicters with challenges of all type.
3,"What next, Mario Theme Park?","This game had it's pros, and it had its cons. Pro - fun for everyone, good clean fun Con - nothing really to difficult, just making sure you stop the line on another line. Pro - Lots of different ways to play, you can play tournaments, or practice, putting challenges, and you have to get birdie badges. Con - Usually Mario is the bomb guy, but in this game he's a really bad golfer :} But overall, this is a good game, that a five year old can play, so go out and get your copy today!Jesse"
5,The best sports game ever,"Mario Golf has beautiful graphics, great sound, and wonderful play control. It is my favorite sports game, and it may soon be yours. I would not recomend this to everyone, though. If you get frustrated easily, you should not buy this game."
1,A Great Game Not!,"I love this Game. It is just a little frustrating when you can't get all the golfers because you don't have the Transfer Pak. The graphics are great but the gameplay becomes boring after you get every golfer. If your a gamer who buys games to defeat them will love this game, otherwise it stinks. ...."
2,Mario Golf,Lo que sucede es que tengo varas semanas queriendo comprarles a Ustedes este producto y no entiendo por qur no me lo pueden vender
2,Not one of his best,"Hmmm, definitely not one of Robin Cook's best. By the end of the 2nd chapter, I was extremely disappointed in Cook's level of writing in this book. ""Oh, and by the way, neither of them knew they had less than bla time to live."" How boring! How cliche! By the middle of the book, I was simply reading because I wanted to finish. I have read many of Cook's other books, and they are much better compared to this particular one. Quite frankly, the Frankenstein story is just not for me."
1,Give me a break,"I had to read this in my Literary Analysis & Expression class at school, to get a handle on some sort of modern work. I admit it wasn't bad at first. When a friend described the ending as ""young kid sells crack to drug-lords while harvesting babies in artficial fetii in his secret lair undergrond, all while artifically inseminating young girls,"" you laugh and shrug it off as being impossible. NOPE. Not a bit short of the truth. In fact, its not even all of the truth, there's more completely unbelievable things. I only wrote a spoiler because you absolutely cannot buy this book. If you really wanna read it, get it at the library, its horrendous."
3,Could have been better,"This novel is about a brilliant scientist who (through modern biological technology and genetic manipulation) creates the ""perfect"" son. Does this sound familiar? Now, everything sounds good so far except for the fact that ""playing God"" has left Dr. Victor Frank with a few deadly consequences. His ""perfect"" son has turned into a perfect nightmare. The story lacks suspence. Some parts got boring, some parts had too much techno babble, and some parts of this story was so outrageous that it became irritating to read. This was my first Robin Cook novel. I hope his other novels are better than this."
4,mutation review,"Robin Cook's Mutation was a wonderful book. The description was very well written. It made the readers able to get a feel for the area where the book was taking place. Robin Cook explains the city and the weather, so we can get a feel for the location. Also, the scientific terms and genetic procedures that were a big part of this book, challenged the readers' level of sophistication. The readers' were forced to try and understand the experiments that Victor and VJ were working on. Mutation kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. The readers' would never know what was around each corner. The book took some very surprising turns, and that is what made it so interesting. Overall, Mutation was a fantastic book: one of the best books I have read in a long time."
2,Mutation Review,"Mutation by Robin Cook has many unrealistic features to it, and really has horrible descriptions. You really can't ever get into the book because it is was too predictable, and gives the story away the ending after about 120 pages. The book was really long and most of the pages weren't necessary and takes up extra space to get to the good parts. In the book it takes the reader no time, to understand that VJ is a very smart individual and has became mutated. I was glad when I got to the end because I didn't have to read anymore of this pointless book."
3,Mutation,"The fiction book Mutation by Robin Cook was a decent book. It was not the best book in the world but it kept your attention. In order to read this book the reader needs to let reality go. If this book is over analyzed it becomes completely unbelievable. The father a scientist that helps create his prodigy of a son, and the over protective psychiatrist mother set the perfect plot for the stereotypical doctor evil, and his creation. Granite Robin Cook uses many medical terms, but it is a medical thriller what is expected? The words are used in context so it is not difficult to figure the words out. In its own special way the book raises questions on biological alterations. Over the entire book is fun and interesting to read. It is perfect to read on the beach or on a rainy day. Let go of reality, sit back and mindlessly read."
1,blown away,"As a fan of Science Fiction and suspense thriller I was blown away by Dr. Robin Cooks ""Mutation""; blown away by the imaginative plot, Cook's superior intelect and his utter disregard for the reader's common sense. This dimented attempt at being a Frankenstein-Mythos has a shere lack of surprise and leaves the reader to sort through piles of pejorative verbiage that Cook spews onto the pages like vomit on an ugly shirt. While winding through the fears of genetic engineering and ridiculous story twists the plot becomes more and more predictable the closer one gets to the overt ending. At best ""Mutation"" would be the perfect book for someone who is serving a life sentence and needs something to swallow in order choak and die."
2,"A not so good ""mutant""","My first impression of the book Mutation, by Robin Cook, was a good one. It is a typical story in which a genetically altered child is too smart for his age and begins to conduct dangerous experiments at his father's lab and at home. Being a suspense/thriller novel, much of the story will leave you guessing, but Mr. Cook keeps you guessing for a long time and it is not until the end of the story that it gets suspenseful. Also, the first one hundred pages are repetitive. Characters are introduced, and you don't learn enough about them to care what is going to happen to them in the future. In this novel, Mr. Cook gives vivid descriptions of everything, which helps to paint a picture, but in order to paint that picture you must get past the large vocabulary. In my opinion, this is a good book for someone with high intelligence who is into science. If you're looking for a ""never want to put down"" book, Mutation is not for you."
2,mixed feelings,"At the end of Robin Cooks Mutation, I was left with mixed feelings. While I found myself unable to put the book down, I continued to come back to the fact that they're so many pointless descriptions. He draws the book out and uses language not suitable for anyone with an education level below a PH.D. Beyond the endless unneeded details there were many similarities and parallels between Mutation and the classic story of Frankenstein. I would not suggest this book to others, although this modern rewrite makes Frankenstein seem less painful. Overall, I rate this book a two, and I wouldn't say it is worth the time it takes to read."
2,A Not So Shocking Thriller!,"The characters presented in this novel are so unbelivable, flaky, and unimaginable. Robin Cook's Mutation is based upon a scientist who goes astray oo an experiment that involves is unborn child, VJ. VJ is a complete monster that destroys everything in his path...at the age of ten he is more intelligent than Einstein himself! This rewrite of Frankenstein has all the charateristics of a bad book. The author, Robin Cook, uses useless information and medical terms that the average reader could not comprehend. only three words come to mind: appalling, repulsive, and horrendous!"
3,The Future Comes To Life,The novel Mutation by Robin Cook is a book that brings the future of cloning to life. It shows what might happen when cloning goes bad. This is displayed when Dr. Frank genetically altered his son VJ to make VJ supper smart. This all goes bad when VJ's own mother who is a psychologist can't see any problems in him. From skipping school to selling drugs VJ will do what ever he can to get what he wants. It all comes to a sudden ending that will knock your socks off.
1,Review of Mutation,"Expectations and predetermined thoughts aside about this Mutation's author Robin Cook, lets get to the heart of the book, the characters. The characters in this book are almost all unbelievable or made unbelievable but their interaction with other characters. For example VJ the 10 year old genius that manufactures cocaine at his fathers lab and sells it to the mob is the most unbelievable. First off the mob would never be involved nor really talk to a 10 year old boy in regards to cocaine. Secondly even by age ten I doubt any boy even a genetically altered one would have no emotions and the intelligence to keep his parents out of any dealings with any other adults other than family friends and coworkers. Overall the book is entertaining but could use some real help with some of the characters and the way they interact with other characters"
5,A good read,"A variation on the Frankenstein theme. Dr. Frank nevers imagines his project to create a perfect son would end up in a experiment gone awry. I was impressed by the moral values of the mother. It created the perfect balance with the naivete if the doctor.The story was moderately paced and the dialogue was good. Having read Coma and Brain beforethis book, I was expecting some surprises. Only a few, but still a good read"
2,"Good story, average writing","It's a typical Robin Cook book with lot of biotechnology jargon. Its' about this scientist who mutates the zygote of his own kid for some experiment. What he ends up with is a child with a abnormally high IQ and absolutely zero emotions. His child turns out into a lonely, unemotional kid, totally detached from this world. This book is about this exceptional, abnormal child and his effect on the people around him.The story is gripping, though predictable. It's a page turner - one can finish the book in a day. The writing is nothing remarkable. The only factor than can keep the reader interested in the book is the story. The characters are pretty well developed, though there a few loopholes.If you are looking for a quick, science thriller, then pick up this book. If you have had enough of science jargons, then move on to the next shelf."
3,Could have been better,"A ten-year-old is injected with ""smart"" genes from a slug-like creature when he was conceived by his doctor-geneticist father. This causes him to have no emotions, but beyond-genius-level IQ. Very suspenseful, but the writing is only average."
2,Hopefully Mutation is not mutated!,"The suspenseful thriller, Mutation written by Robin Cook was not a book that should be recomended to read. Mutation is about a guy who mutates invitro babies. His fanatasies about having a perfect son comes back to haunt him and everything tears his life away. This book did not have anything to keep the reader reading, it was very easy to close. The description in this book is to drawn out. Cook uses to many medical terminology especially when describing the steps to mutating the babies. He also went on about the weather and street signs, which loses the readers attention. The characters in the book were oblivious to what was going on around them, even the stuff happening right under their nose. It is pathetic when a little boy can out smart his own mother and father. Don't waste any time with picking up this book."
1,"""Medical Hodgepodge Overload""","""Mutation"" by Robin Cook is a story about a scientist whose pride drives him to create a child who is smarter than almost anyone in the world. Unfortunately, his creation takes a wrong turn and now he has to stop it. The problem with the book is the way that it is told. Cook uses excessive medical hodgepodge which loses the attention of the reader. Also, the book is too predictable. Cook gives away the plot after the first 100 pages. It doesn't take the reader long to realize that this is just a weird re-mix of ""Frankenstien""."
4,"Mutation, Overall Good","Robin Cook's book Mutation was a scientific thriller that kept me reading page after page. From the beginning of the book where a strange birth takes place to where you find out Vj's a kid super genius, how couldn't you keep reading on?Mutations is about a Dr. Victor Frank whose love for science ultimately conflicts with his better judgment...This book was not only interesting and entertaining but it was also well written. Cook's method of using a lot of detail pays off in this thriller. His descriptions of things such as weather and highway signs help the reader paint a visual picture while reading. This book raises many important matters, one of which is cloning. Cook states his opinion on cloning through his writing very clearly, and I suggest reading this book to all people."
1,Mutation,"Robin Cooks medical thriller ""Mutation"" is a laughable attempt to create a modern day Frankinstien horror novel. The unrealistic characters, and unexplainable events that occur throughout the book create a twisted plot from start to finish. The unnecessary descriptive details add to loss of interest in the book. The predictable novel dissappoints readers with a rushed ending of unthinkable events."
1,Medical Thriller or Classic Killer?,"Robin Cook's 'Mutation' offers little or no intellectual substance. In this so called ""Medical thriller,"" we are introduced to several characters so unbelievable that in no way could we relate our live's to their's. The only thing connecting them with the rest of human kind is their physical make-up, which is described in too much detail. These as well as several other long uninteresting details are distributed so imensely throughout the novel that one is forced to wonder if they are mere space fillers or are just completely inane. Whatever the case, there is actually little importance contained in such deatils. Finally, though, and most imporatntly, mutation is no more than a modernized version of Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' which not only degrades but disrespects the classic novel's ideology by portraying it as simple and unrealistic. You may find better reading on the side of a passing bus."
2,Dr. Cook missed with this book,"Throughout Mutation the parent/child relationship is very awkward. VJ's mother slowly notices that VJ is nothing like other kids his age. VJ has very few friends. When Martha(mother) finds out that VJ was ""made"" by his father, Dr. Frank, she realizes what is wrong with her son. The parent/child relationship gets very bad, even violent when VJ takes his mother captive in his underground lab. The interesting part about the whole book is while martha thinks something is wrong with VJ, Dr. Frank thinks his son is perfect, it isn't until the end of the story until he admits something went terribly wrong with his experiment of creating his super, genius son, VJ."
3,Another Robin Cook Book,"Robin Cook wrote a great medical thriller called ""Mutation."" Throughout this book he showed his passion for medicine. Robin Cook showed this by using medical terms that the average reader has never heard before. This keeps the readers attention. Robin Cook also has a great deal descriptions in ""Mutation."" Some of the descriptions that made up this book grab the readers attention are when he mentions exit numbers off the highway. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading books about medicine, and are looking for a quick read. This book will make you want to read some of Robin Cook's other books since he grabs the reader's attention in ""Mutation."""
2,Never ending Mutation,"The book Mutation, the so called ""Medical Thriller"", was not so much a thriller. The main character, Dr. Frank decides to make the son of his dreams through invitro fertilization, but everything turns into a disaster. The book Mutation was too predictable. The reader knew what was going to happen after the first one hundred pages. The author, Robin Cook, used to many scientific words and went into scientific descriptions, which makes the reader curious as to what he is talking about. Although he had good description, it began to drag on. Cook's novel was an easy read, but not recommended for personal enjoyment."
1,Mutation is quick to read but bad for the brain,"In Robin Cook's Mutation, many classical creator vs. creation themes are addressed, reminiscent of Marry Shelly's ""Frankenstein."" Cooks new take on a very relevant issue in today's technological world is a misfire and fails to transfer the true emotional impact bioengineering would have on Cook's faceless, dauntless, trite, and almost cold characters. Cook uses his broad knowledge of medical jargon to keep the reader interested, but fumbles when plot twists become incomprehensible and unimaginative. I would recommend this book to someone in the mood for a quick one-day read, or someone on a long flight home. I wouldn't expect to be changed much as a person though, maybe just annoyed and ready to go to bed."
2,Another Overused Theme,"""Mutation"", a novel by Robin Cook, was a hard story to get into. The reader had no comprehension of Cook's medical terms and the characters and the plot he used were very unbelievable. The reader was not involved in the novel, or the slightest bit interested, until getting past the first 100 pages because of the over descriptive words. ""Mutation"" was just another story with the overused theme, ""man can't play god."""
2,Robin's Procreative Nightmare,"This story should be on the required reading list for microbiologists and fertility specialists who are promising monthly to clone a human. This story says tampering with human genes might entangle one in the jaws of a freakish mutant. I couldn't quite suspend disbelief for the ten year old monster-boy who dishes out death with the ease of changing a pair of his sneakers. I had problems with the Dad, a scientist who kept denying the clues of his son's complicity faster than he could turn them up. Mom was believable and after what she had to endure one could believe she will have the guts to inject the new found epilogue monster with a well measured dose of death. All in all, MUTATION asks the reader to swallow a regular horse sized pill before reaching the final exit."
1,"Skip this one, but move on.. they get better","This is probably the worst Robin Cook book. It starts off interestingly enough, but by the end the reader is starting to think that this story is too far fetched to be carried out by a young boy.. no matter how smart! I've always liked his books because they ""could happen""... not this one, just skip it and move on to the next book."
4,Strange..,"I actually thought this book was pretty good. It was a bit creepy, but thats what made it good. Dr. Frank messes with mother nature when it comes to making a child. Creating a monster or the child of his dreams... the child he could only hope and pray for. But will VJ prove to be more then the doctor ordered? I recommend this book. It was quick and highly enjoyable."
2,Mutation Review,"In the book Mutation the author Robin Cook made the book so unbelievable in that he creates a 10 year old boy who sells drugs to the mafia to fund his underground lab. Also the Author goes into great detail about pointless things, such as the highway, and exits. Overall this book was terrible. Its a waste of time and money."
2,not very thrilling,"This book was pretty boring. The last 4 pages was about the only really suspenseful part of the book. I loved the idea of the plot, but I dont like the feeling of having to force myself to keep reading. I like when I cant turn the pages fast enough."
3,Reveiw of Muation,"I thought that The book Mutation was written well, but there wasn't a very good plot, and it was hard to follow.It was very well written, using good grammar, nice words, and it definatly had a nice flow to it. But, as I said before, it didn't have a very good plot. The ending really did't fit the story of logical thinking, it was more ""I need an ending to the book so lets just kill somebody"". Also in the book, it had a very scientific flow, but then near the end they introduced drugs, Columbians, and other illegal acts, which really didn't fit the story.It was also hard to follow at many parts because it would switch from different points of veiw randomly. The different points of veiw would have been a very good additive to the book if it switched in the transitions of chapters, but it didn't.Overall this book was well written, but not for those who enjoy an eay to follow book with a plot that makes sence. I give it three out of five."
3,No Need For Mutations,"The book, Mutation, by Robin Cook, is about a scientist who changes the genes in humans and his plan backfires on him. Robin Cook, being a doctor himself, based a book on the impact of mutating genes and how bad it is. But, if it is so bad, then why did he write the book about it?Many of the events in the book are ran on too long. He talks about pointless facts and goes into too much detail when it comes to the setting. The book is a science fiction book, that should be placed in the ""Over the readers head"" section, because it is hard to understand and hard to follow and the ending is basically predictable."
2,Didn't Quite Tickle my Fancy,"I didnt realize how much I disliked the book until I was finished. Science was never really my best subject in school, and half the scientific termonology used in Mutation went right over my head. Many specific details Cook included in his novel were not necessary, and had no importance in telling the story. Obviously I couldnt relate to any of the characters, especially an 11 year old drug lord genius.Maybe if the story was a little more believable, I would have enjoyed it more. But Cook was trying to concoct an updated version of Frankenstein, and I dont think reality was in his agenda. Sure, if you love science and have a PHD, Mutation might be exciting. But for your everyday reader like me,it just didnt do it for me. Cook- better luck next time."
2,"Mutation ""Mutates"" Into a Bad Book","Mutation, by Robin Cook, is a scientific novel which shares the same concept as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Similar to Frankenstein, Mutation has a far-fetched storyline. The plot loses its credibility when the reader finds out that VJ, a ten year old genetically engineered child, is constructing his own state-of-the-art laboratory. The funding for the laboratory is brought in through a Colombian drug operation. Overall, Mutation did not keep its reader captivated due to its inconceivable characters and overwhelming plot."
2,unbelievable can be good and bad...,"The first 100 pages or so of ""Mutation"" by Robin Cook really had me guessing on what this book was really about. The next 100 pages started to dissapoint me, and by the end of the book I was so dumbfounded by the book that I was questioning reality. All though Cook has some good detail in ""Mutation"", it was in alot of the wrong places. Cook tried to wow his audience too much with fancy medical terms instead of concentrating on character and plot development. All though I will not ever consider ""Mutation"" as a literature masterpiece, I could still see myself reading it as a ""Vacation Book""."
1,Bad choice for young adults,"Mutation was a very predictable novel. As a reader, I could see what was going to happen within the first 100 pages of the novel. This is one point that made this book badly written. Although the characters were developed well, they were simply unbelievable. They were reminiscant of the characters from Frankenstien. The names of all the characters were identical in a sense, of those in Frankenstein. Dr. Cook wrote too much on reacurring incidences with certain characters which just made the reader feel like they had just read that. Another point to harp on would be the terrible plot. It was hard to follow while reading along. With the rambling scientific terms to the 10 year old genius. Mutation was a bad choice for yong adults to read."
5,Biotechnology gone awry!,"This was required reading for my Biotechnology class and to my surprise, a very terrifying and captivating novel! As a Biosciece major, it is all too real!!!"
4,"""Mutation""","In Robin Cook's book ""Mutation,"" Dr. Frank in the novel creates a specific gene that he then places into his unborn child. Once his son is born the nightmare begins. This novel presents heavy scientific language throughout which makes it abundant in vocabulary. Also, Robin Cook uses elaborate descriptions and details that keep you interested and on the edge of your seat at all times. An example is when Dr. Frank finally switches sides and destroys his son at the end of the book by creating a descriptive detailed solution. By this the novel ""Mutation"" expresses intelligence and suspensefulness that will keep you reading."
2,Mutation Falls Short,"Robin Cook's Mutation is a book that deals with unrealistic situations and elaborate descriptions. Characterization in this book failed miserably and it is hard to feel a connection with any of these characters in the novel. Because of this, the reader has a hard time caring what happens and his/her feelings for the book generally decrease. The ""cookie cutter"" characters used in this book were unrealistic and did not develop signifigantly throughout the novel.Description played a double role in this book. It is very elaborate and detailed but in many cases was unnecessary and drawn out. Cook describes such things as highway exits and street signs but this does nothing for the novel. The end of this book was the best part because it was finally over."
1,Ohhhhhhh my good golly,"A doctor genetically alters his son so he is a genios, son surpases fathere, discovers tons of biological break throughs that are horrifying. The overall conflict of the story is relatively entertaining, but overall and ultimately ridiculous. None of the events are believable. A boy with twice Einstein's intelligence, who makes coke and has his own gang of South Americans, while inserting frozen fertilized eggs into young girls? Yeah ok that's entirely unrealistic in the greatest fashion. This book gets a 1 star fo' sho!"
5,Mutation,"Riveting,suspenseful cook keeps u wondering throughout the entire story and keeps u on edge. It's a master of scientific energy"
5,Lots of Twists!,"I love thrillers, medical thrillers and books by Robin Cook! This book is an excellent read! Hard to put down"
3,Average and predictable,"Relatively fast read but writting was predictable and generic. Maybe it's the 21st century, but text that reads: ""those meddling kids"" rings of Scooby Doo, not a thrilling page turner. Simple sentences, predictable dialogue are only mitigated by an mildly interesting plot. 3/5 stars = more of a 60% rating as opposed to the ""I liked it"" rating.Average read."
1,Mutation of a descent story,"Robin Cook's Mutation is a thriller about a Geneticist who plays God with his unborn child. The book builds on that simple idea to create a turbulent reading experience full of confusion and sour feelings from the reader.Mutation, despite some good qualities, lacks a fluid story. This hurts the book as a whole because the plot is broken by descriptions of laboratory equipment, street names, and other things that hold no bearing on the story. In Cook's defense, he does have a strong descriptive knowledge of his equipment.All in all, the book lets the reader down. The broken plot makes understanding the events too hard, and the reader then chooses not to accept them."
1,Believable or Not,"The medical thriller ""Mutation"", written by Robin Cook, is to far-fetched to actually be believable. A young child could not be capable of toying with God's own human creation. The way the characters interact with each other and their thoughts about one another are also unbelievable. At some points in the book, common sense is lacking. The mother of VJ is a child psychiatrist and doesn't even know her own sons problem. I mean come on!"
2,Mutation,"While reading the novel Mutation, by Robin Cook, it was impossible to not see the resemblance to Frankenstein, written by Mary Shelley. Mutation was just a modern day Frankenstein story with Dr. Frank (Dr. Frankenstein) and his creation gone badly. But in Mutation, Frank's creation is his son, who builds a secret underground lab that is being funded by him manufacturing his own cocaine and is selling it to drug lords. But then, it gets better because Dr. Frank's son VJ is only eleven years old while doing all this. The book while interesting had too many specific references to medical terms that any normal person could not possibly come to terms with and also a lot of specific details that did not end up being significant at all. If you are into medical thrillers that have the same plot lines as other novels, then this book is a good pick for you."
1,To many descriptions,"In Mutation by Robin Cook the scientific knowledge and terminology used is brilliant in showing how smart the characters and writers are portrayed. Mutation shows that the author really does think that his readers are intelligent and are able to understand the strong words being used. Mutation turns into a run in with a father, Victor, who creates a genius son named Vj with the advances of science. It turns so twisted toward the end of the book between the unrealistic antics of a boy and his family. The long line of scientific descriptions in this book along with other pointless descriptions can be useless and very hard to fallow. The story line could not be more predictable in showing what will happen in the 400 pages of this book."
1,Not the same,"I was required to purchase the 3rd edition of this text and naturally came here, as it is almost always cheaper. Upon clicking the Kindle Edition of the 3rd edition, I was directed here, to a first edition, which will not suffice. Very disappointed that I cannot purchase the most up to date version on my Kindle."
1,Vocabulary over most people's heads,"I am a graduate student working on a masters degree in counseling. One of my classes requires this book as our textbook. The professor spoke highly of this book. Now, I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I'm certainly not the dullest; I found this reading to be much too doctoral in its vocabulary. Frequently, I had to look up the definitions of words just so I could understand what in the world I was reading. For a ""foundations"" book, I would like to see/read one that is written on a level that could be understood by someone other than an experienced clinical psychologist or Ph.D."
5,"NOT A REGULAR MOVIE! YES, MUST BRING BACK TO STORES!","a gorgeous and devastating film. witnessing not only the huskies' emotion-wrenching plight but also the heartbreak and devotion of the scientist who brought the dogs is almost too much to bear; and not just for animal-lovers but for anyone with a pulse. the movie is so absorbant, one does not even realize they are reading subtitles! i cried tears of joy and sorrow.truly, a masterpiece on all aesthetic, emotional, and technical levels!"
4,A decent clock radio,"Considering I was upgrading from a REALLY aweful little clock radio, this was a huge step up. After you read the instructions, the clock was a breeze to operate. Nice big display. Easy ""Snooze"" button for those mornings where you juuuuuust can't find the off button (you all know what I mean). High quality sound. I'm a fan."
3,An average performer,"I purchased this clock back in 2007 or so and still have it. I will second what a lot are saying about the unit:1) The backlight, even on the lowest setting, can be too bright2) There are a myriad of tiny buttons to control the individual functions of the unitOtherwise I have no complaints. Pulls in all of the local stations just find and has surprising sound for such a small clock radio. I do like the auto time set and the built in battery to retain time and alarm settings. I keep looking for new alarm clocks and keep coming back to this unit. I even had a fancier one with an iPod dock and a digital picture frame but the build quality of that unit was poor so I came back to this one.The price has also come down to a reasonable level. It's a solid 3 * performer. Comes with a built in Audio In cord to connect iPod or other MP 3 players."
5,wonderful,My grandson loves this. The tone is terrific for a clock radio. The light also makes a good night light.
5,Good CD clock radio for reasonable price,This is a good CD clock radio for reasonable price. Sound is pretty good. Note that it does not have a headphone output.
2,NO EAR PHONE IN THIS RADIO!!!!,BEWARE!!!!! THERE IS NO EAR PHONE JACK IN THIS RADIO... YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO CD'S AT NITE IN YOUR COMFY BED!!!!! NICE RADIO BUT I HAD TO RETURN IT!!!!TRY TO GET THE OLD SONY ICF CD 855V. IT IS NOT MADE ANY MORE BUT I FOUND ONE AND IT IS GREAT! CAN'T IMAGINE WHY 'SONY' WOULD FORGET THE PHONE JACK!!!!
2,did not last even a year,"I purchased this clock radio/CD player for my 7 year old for Christmas last year so that we could get rid of the large boom box she used for her night time music. I purchase this product because it had a CD player and was small and sleek looking and I figured a Sony would be a good brand. Just last month the CD player no longer works and I now do not have a way of returning it. THis was a very expensive ""clock/radio"" I believe I paid around $80 total including S&H. Very disappointed in this product from Sony."
1,very disappointing!,"After paying 80 dollars, I would hope that the CD player would resume where it stopped after shutting it off, rather than starting at the beginning of the CD each time. Also, there is no mega-base, so the sound sucks."
3,Great but for two design issues,"I've now had this and been using it for about a year. It works perfectly but has two annoying design issues that have been slowly grinding on me enough that I'm now looking for a replacement. The display has 3 preset light levels and the lowest makes my dark bedroom glow at night and the button to turn off the alarm is the second small button from the top on the right of the clock (you can see it if you look closely at the picture). The light may not bother some people but I like a dark bedroom and from experience I can tell you it is not easy to find the alarm off button if you've had a late night. If these two items don't bother you, I'd recommend buying this as everything else works as advertised."
5,I want to stay in bed just to hear the alarm go off!,"If only it would do the dishes too... this machine is fantastic! I can't imagine anyone not loving all its features. I can never go back to a normal alarm clock. I love the alarm settings - having two alarm features is great but being able to set one to a CD and the other to a radio wake up is fabulous. More fabulous is controlling how loud each turns on. The nap feature? Brilliant! The volume max? Crazy loud. I could have a party in my bedroom! The backlighting on the display? If I was having a party, the blue lights would create great effect otherwise, dimming it and turning it off is an easy and obvious solution. Yes, I am in love with my CD Clock Radio Alarm. How hAve I lived without one?"
2,Another Night Light,This clock radio/CD player has the same kinds of short comings found in almost all modern clock radios and clock radio/CD combos. It has intensely bright LCD back panel lighting which even at the lowest setting will drive you to a blind fold! The controls are placed in awkward locations and difficult to find in the dark given their very small size. It has no audio out jack for external earphones or speaker. FM reception is about average as far as range reception and sound quality. Average for clock radios is almost always terrible.SONY has made some good home electronics and I was really disappointed with their effort on this model.
4,Big but AWESOME!!!!,"The alarm is pretty sweet. Apart from the usual stuff that it rocks, i love the three lighting settings it has. The previous dream machine i hadhad a really bright light bleed from the back and was kinda annoying. This one eliminated that problem by having three setting, the lowest of which barely emits any light.Only two things i wish sony would fix on its next incarnation.. Make is smaller and have a docking port for the ipod.If this thing was smaller, i would have given it 5 stars...this thing is worth the money"
2,Big disappointment,"CD started sticking/skipping after one week of use. I had no choice but to return it. It seemed to have every feature a person could want. It was easy to set. Although the sound wasn't very good, I would have kept it if it had kept working. If you really want to try it, be prepared to possibly return it. Save your packaging."
4,good purchase,"Good sound and functions for a desktop radio/alarm/CD player. Lights can be easily dimmed to appropriate level. Some buttons on the back & side are hard to read in the black color model, but they aren't used that often. Built-in audio cable is a nice feature and the sound is pretty good from my ipod, compared to other products I've tried. It's a little bulky, but it does a lot. I would have liked a ""sounds"" option- like ocean waves, etc. to sleep or wake to in addition to the radio, cd, & alarm functions. So far, I'm happy with this product. I can listen to the radio, cd, & my ipod in one place with pretty good sound for a portable unit."
2,I am disappointed,"I had primarily purchased this clock radio for 2 purposes, one was to get access to stations my 20 dollar clock radio cannot and 2. to be able to play cds. This clock radio failed on both counts- it cannot catch stations my cheap 20 year old boom box can, and it doesn't play cds very well- it always seems to get stuck or start skiping on the 6th or 7th track. Now I wish I had invested in something a little better"
1,What is wrong with the cd player?,"When the cd is playing, it is making a lot of noise. I returned it, and Amazon sent me another one. Same problem. The cd noise is louder than the music. It is ruining my enjoyment of my music. VERY ANNOYING!!!"
2,Why is something so easy so hard?,"Just out of the box, this is a first impression. Major complaint: the FM reception on this model is actually worse than the 22-year-old Dream Machine that this unit replaces, even in the Mono mode. Why don't manufacturers include a simple metal telescoping antenna with these units? The pathetic little wire that passes for an antenna in this case won't stay put in your preferred position unless it's attached to something. Note to designer: remarkably, the wire Scotch-taped to our bedroom wall isn't that attractive. Who would have thought? This is a foolish economy on Sony's part. At first I thought I might be getting interference from our portable phone, which sits on the same nightstand and is plugged into the same outlet. So I unplugged the phone, but it made no difference. Decent reception: why is something so easy so hard to get right? Radios are not exactly cutting edge technology, but it seems that decent reception was an afterthought with this unit."
1,Disappointed in the sound quality,I bought this Sony to replace the same basic model we bought about 5 years ago. The old one's cord broke off close to the plug. It has the same great features and is just what we wanted for our kitchen but we are really disappointed in the difference in sound quality and reception. The new model sounds very tinny and it doesn't pick up the same stations we were able to get before. It isn't enjoyable listening to CDs and even the radio sounds like it is in a pail. Especially for the price I was expecting more from Sony. If I knew how to return it easily I probably would.
3,wonderful for 1 month,"The CD playing function for my unit failed within a month of purchase. During this time, I've used the CD function for about 5 times. Even before it completely died, I have had occasional trouble with playing CDs (ie, the same disc will play great for an hour, then goes kaput the next). Hopefully this was an isolated incident. I am in the process of trying to get an exchange with Amazon. It would really be a shame if I have to return this product for good; it was perfect while it lasted.*UpdateI got a new unit from Amazon within 2 days of filing for return. It's been over 5 months and I've had no problems with the new one since. I am so so so happy that I get to keep this amazing product!!!"
4,Sony ICF-CD7000 AM FM Stereo CD Clock Radio,"Very nice clock radio. I especially like the dual settings for wake up times and the nap setting. The clock allows choice of which media (AM, FM or CD) and volume to wake up to. Others have expressed concern about the clock being too bright at night but I find it OK for sleeping on the lowest illumination setting - and that is easy to change. It does have a lot of buttons and settings and the first few times I set the alarm time/station/volume I had to look up the instructions. Instruction book is clear and easy to use. On the whole, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
3,works ok,"This clock radio is one of the few which does almost everything I want it to do. It plays a CD, has two alarm settings, and a nap button. My three complaints are: 1) it's huge; and 2) the nap function can be set in ten minute intervals only until 1/2 hour then skips to 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Would it have been so hard to keep the ten minute intervals all the way through? 3) the snooze will not operate in nap mode. I previously had an RCA which did everything I wanted, but after I'd had it a little over a year, it began to scream one day then died. If I wasn't leery of it malfunctioning again,I would have bought another RCA."
3,Not very intuitive,"Very sleek design. Lights up nicely. Does what it is advertized to do. However, one cannot use it without reading the directions. Setting the alarm(s) cannot be done w/o thoroughly reading product information. Designed by engineers for engineers."
1,Hard to Use,The problem with this clock is finding the button you want. I really could not believe so many people liked this clock its been years of slow torture for me. I cannot wait for it to break so I can toss it. It is an adventure every time I try and turn the radio on or off or adjust the volume. If you wear glass forget this clock. The clock does have a very large snooze bar which is handy.
3,The CD player doesn't work,"The CD player doesn't work properly. After a short while it gets stuck--it sounds like a broken record. I called tech support, and they told me to disconnect it and push all the bottoms twice. It didn't work. I would have to send it back but that is too inconvenient. Otherwise, I would like this unit very much--the radio and clock work fine."
2,Had higher hopes,Really wanted a radio in my bedroom that was capable of producing decent sound. This doesn't have it. It sounds like every other clock radio out there except Bose. I like the design and size but it's not worth the price. The CD alarm option is very poorly designed.
3,"Loved it, but died 20 months later","Loved everything about it. Sounded good, able to easily adjust the brightness of the display, & became addicted to the nap setting. Then, one morning the ""sleep"" cd I play at night wouldn't stop playing. None of the buttons would work. I had to open the CD player to stop it, but now it will never play again. ALL buttons stopped working. Snooze, nap, radio, cd, display brightness...sadly, it's garbage now. Except that it does still display the correct time."
2,sleek looking but hard to use and CD skips,"This unit is very cool looking. However, most of the user buttons are quite small and several are on the sides of the unit and are black on black so you can't read which is for what. Keep the directions handy and then memorize the side buttons. Also, possibly because the CDs play at an angle, I have found that a number of them will skip or slide over passages. The clock is 10 minutes slow."
2,CD Player on a Brand New One Won't Work,"I ordered this for my wife who has a hard time falling asleep while I am away. I bought it for her while I was gone assuming that the Sony quality was there and I had nothing to worry about. I was extremely disappointed that when I returned from a month long trip, which is only 2 and a half weeks after this Clock Radio arrived, The darn CD player stopped playing and would just tick. I used to only buy Sony Electronics but lately the quality just isn't there."
2,Not worth the money,"This clock radio/CD player looks nice, but it isn't up to the job. The CD player sometimes stutters. Worse, the volume periodically goes much louder, and then gradually falls back again to its normal level. If you want a CD player for listening to CDs as you drop off to sleep, this is a deal-breaker.Also, it doesn't come with a headphone socket, although I thought from the reviews that there was one. My fault, I guess.Overall, this is simply not good enough quality for what it costs. I would recommend buying a cheaper radio alarm clock/CD player. Very disappointed."
2,Lots of tiny tiny buttons makes this hard to use,The control buttons on this are very small and very nearly identical to one another.I find it irritating to have to search the very tiny text labels to figure out which one to push.Great for people who like fussy-to-use devices.I don't.For those with difficulties reading small text the device is inappropriate.
3,It is was it Is,"I bought this as a gift for a family member for Christmass. They enjoy it very much. it is compact and has all the features he wanted , am/fm , cd player, also plays mp3 cd's, and alarm clock, I was surprised to find it had a headphone cord that allows you to plug into your mps player or ipod headphone slot built in. Not that my 72 year old father is going to be rocking out on an ipod anytime soon . If you are looking for a Ipod dock /radio do not buy this. I bought only because my dad still has not got past cd's and thats o.k.. sound is what you expect from two small sony speakers, mediocre. All in all it does what it says. missing battery back up though. I prefer my alarms to have battery power as well as ac in case of power outage. it plays cd's can listen to the radio and it has an alarm clock. It is what it says it is"
2,Good but not good,"This clock radio was a gift for my wife who was pregnant so that she could listen to ""hypno birthing"" while in bed. We've always had luck with stylish Sony CD players. However, this time we had a few problems. Within 4 days of coming out of the box, its broken. Not only is there a couple lines missing from the display (a '3' looks like three parallel lines) but something is blown on one of the speakers. It sounds like the kind of distortion you get from putting too high of a pre-amp volume into a secondary amp. its all distorted. Unfortunately, since it was a gift, the box got thrown out. Now we're unable to return it.If it were 100% working when it arrived, it would still leave something to be desired, since clock radios sound like .. clock radios. I'd love to have some external speaker ports where I can plug in my much larger extra speakers and get a nice sound."
5,Simply great.,It does what it states. I love the fact that I can plug my Creative Zen into and the sound is clear and crisp. Super Alarm clock.
5,Very happy with this clock radio,"After a little confusion on how to set the alarms and play the disc( I admit I am techno challenged) this clock radio has worked liked a dream. The display can be quite bright, but you are easily able to adust this if it bothers you. Very easy to shift back and forth between CD and radio functions. You can set buttons for the radio stations you listen to the most. Very easy to move back and forth on discs to find the trac you want to play. Everything very positive with this purchase."
4,Sony clock radio,"A good radio. My main complaint would be the buttons are too small. The programming is cumbersome at first, but should be easier with time. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,terrible FM reception,"Overall this is a fairly nice unit however I found that sound quality to be fair at best and the radio reception is terrible. If you are planning to mostly listen to CD's or use it to play your MP3's then I would say it's a nice unit. If you plan on using it to listen to the radio, I would reccomend passing."
5,Perfect CD Clock Radio,"I think this is the best CD clock radio out there right now. My children love to play CDs in their room, and I wanted something that functioned both as a clock and a CD player. An added bonus is that it comes with a special cable to attach and play your iPod or other mp3 player. I went through an RCA CD player that died after 2 months and even the Panasonic one I got broke after a few months. I have had this unit for almost 2 years and it works flawlessly and sounds great. Even though Sony is a good name, I haven't had a lot of luck with Sony products in the past, but this one deserves the Sony name."
3,Good But Not Great,"Two items would have made this a 5 star, Great review. I take 1 star away for some of the buttons being too small and the text under them barely readable. The other star is taken away because of no headphone jack. I understand that this is not a concern for most people, but on some websites it is listed as a feature, but does not exist. BE WARNED. Overall I think this a very good CD Player/Clock Radio. the led brightness does not bother me and the sound is pretty good for 2 small speakers. I am returning mine because I must have a headphone jack and I purchased this because I saw that one existed, but doesn't."
3,No headphone jack,"This is a very nice radio, but it doesn't have a headphone jack as the description states. What it has is an audio in plug so you can listen to an alternate device through the radio speakers, like an mp3 player. I'm returning mine because I wanted to be able to use headphones with it."
4,My kid loves it!,I put this album on close to bedtime and my kid just mellows out. The music has a lot of groove but is undeniably relaxing. I'd recommend it to other parents.
2,This viedo is pretty dated,"I am an elementary art teacher and I included a segement of this video in a lesson about buildings.I am a big fan of Red Grooms, but the video quality is really dated and the critics speaking about him are generally boring and long-winded. I used to show another video about Red Grooms, but it is sadly unavailable."
2,Not much here,"Not much to learn from this ""instructional"" DVD. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money. More of a self indulgent tribute to ""the institute"" Good skiers but no information of value. More useful information on youtube for free."
3,"Fun for daughter, but annoying for parent","I just brought this for my 5 year old daughter. The only major problem is that there is no volume control. Barbie sings and it is annoying, its so loud. On the plus side, there are not a lot of small parts to get lost or broken and my daughter does love it, but I have a feeling that it will only hold her attention for so long. So buy at your own risk."
2,Lame-O,"My daughter got this for her 5th birthday. She played with it once in the last month and a half. The songs are very difficult for a little one to sing along with, since she can't read yet. The cheap cardboard fan behind her head came off right away. The rest seems durable. Personally I think a singing head is just plain creepy."
2,Pretty but not practical (or functional!),"My daughter received this from her Nana for her 5th birthday. While my 8-year-old son was carefully helping me remove the head from all the wires, etc. in the box, he snagged his finger in a tangle in Barbie's hair, and the whole lock of hair came right out. We were all kind of dumb-founded, and my son (being the boy he is) took about five strands of hair in his fingers and gently pulled up and most all the strands came out. The hair is difficult to comb through, especially with the little brush that comes with it, and there is no weight to hold the head down, so she tips over easily. The only good part of this toy is the microphone component. My daughter would walk around singing in the microphone, dragging the useless Barbie head around. So, we are sending this toy back and will be getting her a child's cd player with a microphone instead!"
2,That is so creepy!,Why do the toymakers insist on making every good toy so over the top that it borders on bizarre? I don't think I will be buying my daughter a talking disembodied head when a mere disembodied head would do. :-)
4,Still the best sunscreen,I use this stuff for surfing. I carry a bit with me in a pocket in a small makeup mirror thing-a-ma-jib and reapply to my face if I bump my nose or scratch it. It's still the best 100% sunblock out there if that's what you are looking for.
3,Good book but...,"At times it feels disconnected, especially at the beginning. Throughout the book, the author simply gives headlines describing what the following is going to be about and then goes on to elaborate on the topic that has to do with the headline. Too many times no connection is made between what was previously written and what is written now, and therefore anyone who is new to the mortgage field might feel lost at times while reading the book.Otherwise, it's a good book to buy if you're a rookie in the mortgage business. For its price, I'd recommend it to everyone who is new to the mortgage business."
5,A Must Have!!,"I am new to the mortage business and have pruchased several books on the industry. This book is by far, the BEST! It contains an amazing amount of information for those who are new to the industry. It supplies you with sample sheets of everything you will need and explains them in great detail. I cannot say enough about how valuable I feel this book has been to me! I highly recommend it to anyone new or unfamiliar with the mortgage industry!"
4,Straight to the point!,"I really enjoyed this book because it was written in 'plain' language without any fluff. It was well written, the material was explained very well, and straight to the point. It doesn't promise that you will be a millionare in 45 days or anything else as crazy as that. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it for a friend as a gift!"
3,Good but not what i thought,"This book is very good and very informative. For anyone in the mortgage business its a great text. However the title would seem to imply its more about marketing. Its really more about understanding the technical aspects of the mortgage business. They type of loans, how they work, how credit works etc. If you are looking for a great text to explain the details of the work then this is it. However dont let the title fool you. You will not find a book full of marketing strategy and techniques."
5,Great Info -- Easy Read!,"I've picked up a few books on the subject and find them to be quite slow reads. Seppinni caught and held my attention with plain English and tons of info. I recommend this manual to anyone wishing to get into the business needing a thorough ""turn to"" manual."
5,A Canadian Classic (this is not meant to be an insult),"This has been my favorite halloween movie since youth. It has humor that can entertain all ages. This is a classic, MUST SEE! Especially for 37 cents."
1,no didgital copy included,"I am very disappointed with Amazon. This DVD was supposed to contain a digital copy. I can't find any information how to get the copy, only to return the item."
3,Have def seen better.,"This movie was alright... the plot was 'out there' but it was cute as far as a talking dog movie goes.But the cast wasn't the same (as the first one) and even the dogs looked different. For a 'sequel' it wasn't good.I think you need the orginal cast to call it a 2. But who am I to say?My kid REALLY wanted to see it, I paid $10 (give or take) for a blu ray or I could have rented it on vudu for $6.99.Overall its a good deal. I guess I coulda got it cheaper at the redbox, but still... I get two really bad dvds for $10.. who can pass that up?! lol.Nah.. my kid liked it and it didn't make her cry like Despicable Me did. And it kept my attention longer... or maybe its because I was so out of my mind from watching BHC2 that I couldn't sit to watch DM in the same night... IDK So 3 stars..."
3,gone to the dogs,I bought this movie after watching the first one with my youngest daughter she is so animal crazy its a phase i hope the first beverly hills chihuahua was about an over pampered pooch it gets lost then stolen then rescued by another chihuahua the second movie was more about pampered dogs and basicaly the same fall in love ending the first movie had trying not to spoil the 2nd movie incase you havent seen it. If your a dog lover this movies for you im a cat lover.
1,DON'T ORDER HERE IF YOU WANT THE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!,"I bought this DVD for my little girl as a reward for being a good girl and doing a good job (she is only 4 1/2 years old) and when we got it today there was only a sloppy plastic shrink wrap on the box, no security tape keeping it closed and NO DVD IN THE BOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY DAUGHTER WAS CRUSHED! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE OPENED IT, TOOK THE DVD, AND SLOPPILY SEALED THE PLASTIC BACK UP! DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER EVER! I WOULD GIVE A ZERO IF I COULD!"
2,A dog of a movie,"the first movie was an amusing little film with a nice story line...This one was boring, plotless and a classic 'do it again' that didn't work....I am glad I rented it and didn't buy...."
1,DVD skipped and had a large scratch on it.,"The movie was labeled ""like new"" but had a large scratch on it upon receipt and skips in several places. Will be purchasing only ""new"" DVDs in the future so that we can actually watch the movie. Disappointing."
4,Cute Family Comedy,"My 5 year old was very excited to see this sequel. I agree It wasn't as good as the first one but still wouldn't have missed seeing it. I purchased it with the $10 off coupon from Disney, which gave me a total of $15 for the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack, worth it in my book. Great family story that teaches some good lessons."
4,SILLY BUT FUN,"For animal lovers, how could you not enjoy a movie with five chihuahua puppies? This straight to DVD sequel to BHC1 doesn't do anything new but it provides lots of smiles and chuckles.Don't worry about plot or strong storyline..it's mainly all about family values, courage and love. Awww..what more could you expect?The voice acting is suitable especially George Lopez's Papi. Parents can enjoy this one with the kids."
4,cute movie,"I just like cute movies, and talking, hero puppies takes the cake. Add some romance and some daring chivalry and you've got the makings of a really good movie."
5,Daugher was excited to receive this gft.,This gift came in a very timely manner for Christmas. This was a Christmas List request that was fulfilled and my daughter is happy with this gift.
4,Cuter than I expected,"My 7 and 8 year old loved it as much as #1 and #2, and I have to admit that I enjoyed it more than I expected. The quality has not fallen off on the sequels, so if you enjoyed #1, you'll probably like #3. If you didn't, well you aren't likely to enjoy this one either. I was pleasantly surprised as the story while somewhat predictable (hey it's a kids movie, what do you expect?) was still well executed and amusing."
2,ehh,"We didn't like it as much as the first one. The character voices have changed and even the chihuahuas are different ones. It's so cliche, too! My daughter loved the first one and she couldn't sit through this one"
2,chihauhau dvd,the dvd does not work. it took along time to get it and then it does not even work. it freezes after almost every frame.
2,Chihuahua 1 1/2,"Positives:(1.) Well trained dogs.(2.) Pretty good CG on dog talking.Negatives:(1.) Another in a long line of cheaply produced Disney movies.(2.) Missed a creative opportunity (as if Disney even knows what that means anymore) by not having a scenario where the dogs journey down to Central America to rescue their owner. Instead it's the same old safe, boring studio and local mansion sites for filming. Thus the tone is set - boring (unless you're dog obsessed; which means anything with a dog in it is a no-brainer, pun intended)."
2,Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3,"My 4 year old found it boring, and really was not interested in watching it after 10 minutes. She usually loves Movies"
3,Cute - but not the first one !,"My girl loved the first one - so we went for the second.. she liked it but not loved it , the people where not the same :( I am not sure if she picked up on it but I did."
2,"If you must, buy it only if you can get it cheap, really cheap","My family enjoyed the first in this ""series"", but this one fell far short of the first. The acting is poorly done, the type one envisions in soap operas (I don't watch them, which is why I say envisions). There is the now too usual Disney stpudity of things like the ""father"" dog urinating on paperwork from a bank to stop the bank from using the paperwork. Why Disney has stuff like that in its products I will never understand. At the end of the day this movie will mostly please little ones, which makes it all the more of a shame they have stuff like that in the movie. I'm glad I got this through Amazon's new/used option and paid very little. It wasn't even worth that."
3,OK but not as good as the first one,This movie is fun but has different characters playing the people roles and different voices for the dogs except Poppy is the same. Its fun for little kids(age 4) and is entertaining enough.
2,There's better books however.,"Everyone knows that Streamliners are known not for the exterior, but also for their elegant interior! A bit disappointed on the text of this book. Little reference as far as the interior of the coaches. There is only a brief description of the diesel engines of these Santa Fe Streamliners. Nothing much about the E-units or even the First Super Chiefs. If you really like to know more about these Santa Fe Streamliners, I would suggest the book Streamliners: The Pre-war years and Streamliners: Post-war years. Those book has more information than this book. The photo from this book was COPIED from the book Santa Fe Streamliners: The Chiefs and thier Tribesmen which in my opinion is a little better book but still lacks information as far the interior of these great Streamliners. The only useful I found useful is the schedule. Nothing more."
1,"Uh-Oh, He Got Caught!","Just read today that the National Archives have discovered that Mr. Lowry changed an Abraham Lincoln document to make it look like that the last thing Lincoln did on 14 April 1865 (the day of his death) was pardon a soldier. Mr. Lowry told the Archives that he did it to essentially make himself important because he was the doscoverer of this amazing document. The statute of limitations have passed and Mr. Lowry will not be charged for desicrating and national document; however, this now puts everything Mr. Lowry has written under a microscope of suspicion. Now his work needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It's really sad when someonne sabotages themselves for a little bit of recognition."
4,Why measure software development?,"All about what motivated the Hewlett-Packard company to get involved in a software development metrics program. This is not a how-to book, but good background for thinking about why you would want to measure software development work rather than just doing it.If you want to learn more about metrics, try this online course:[...]"
2,"Good story, Ponderous writing","At the heart, there is a great story here. The characters and plot are both intriguing and well-thought out. Unfortunately, Wright spends too much time describing unnecessary scenes.It's difficult to write a GOOD dream sequence; there's always the danger that the reader will be overwhelmed while trying to figure out symbolic connections and allusions. This book is full of dream and memory sequences, some of which aren't necessary to either plot or character development; they punctuate the story and are slightly painful to read (boring actually). I had a very hard time actually getting to the end of this novel because of all the irrelevant prose I had to plough through.Essentially, the bones of this novel seem strong, but they are buried under a mountain of dross."
2,Wright should stick to Sci-Fi,"As K. Butler said in another review, and this bears reiterating, Wright's excellent Golden Age science fiction series should not be used as a benchmark for Everness.Everness, while mildly entertaining, is by no means a masterpiece. In fact, it is not even that great of a novel series. Throw a few different brands of mythology in a big blender, chuck in some hollywood stereotypes for characters (including the Bitter Old Vietnam Veteran), and stir until no longer lumpy. Try not to fall asleep while eating.Go for Golden Age. It is incredible. Pass by this pile."
4,The High House Returns in a dream,"I am amazed no one has stated the co-incidences of the plot with James Stoddards ""The High House"" which was called evenmere, while this High House is called ""Eveness"". It even has that same high fantasy feel to it."
4,Surprisingly good but drops off toward the end,"4 aspect I will judge this story by, Story, Worldbuilding, Characterization and Emotional response.Story: 4 starsCharacterization: 4 starsWorldbuilding: 4 starsEmotional response: 4 stars"
3,Beware the throat width,"This lock mechanism is pretty slick.Unfortunately, my 2001 travel trailer with an Atwood tongue turns out to have a latch that's nearly 1/8"" wider than the throat of this lock, so it simply doesn't fit. Nothing in the current published specs allowed me to discover that without first purchasing the lock."
4,Duarable item.,"Compared it to a lot of other coupler locks, and this one seems to provide the most security for the best price."
3,Hitch Coupler Lock,"The lock did not fit my particular coupler latch. After using a file to make it fit, it worked well."
4,Very Good,This book was shipped in a timely manner. It is a very easy read with great pictures that young children will enjoy.
4,GOT IT FAST AND CHEAP!,"I was in a jam helping my math students with their assignments....and I knew the price of textbooks was sky high....but then I found this book at a reasonable price, ordered it and got it in a few days. Now I can prepare ahead of time for my tutor sessions and stay on top of my job.....Thanks! BTW, the book is in good condition, better than I expected for the money."
4,Hyundai keyless remote,"I got the keyless remote in August 2010 but just took it to the dealer in December 2010. The remote was in great shape, I will tell more, when I actually get it programmed. I'm now in the process of purchasing another one."
3,Do the job,"These work, but they are thick compared to keyed locks making them inconvenient for some types of storage. Be careful when you set the combination, it's easy to set it one number off by mistake."
4,No more need to find key in the dark!,"Its a little thick but sure is very strong. Not fitting with my Remington 870, Remington 700, Ruger 10/22 very well but sure work super with my Walther PPK/S pistol. It sure is a universal gun trigger lock but best with pistol."
5,easy and works great,"no more lost keys, no more sticky locks, no more remembering the factory code, this thing is awesome."
3,it's okay,"Not bad for the price. I bought two of them, one for my home defense shotgun that's not stored in the gun safe and another for the .117 caliber pellet rifle I keep in the garage for varmint management. The dials are a bit slippery on this Master Lock, so if I can find another combo gun lock with better and more positive dial action, I'll be replacing the Master locks."
3,Easy to use,I bought this for an old 22 rifle I found in my closet and cleaned up. It's easy and intuitive to use. Seems to securely conceal the trigger well. I bought it because I won't have to keep track of keys.
4,Works very well -,"The lock fits my guns perfectly, the only thing that is a bit of a bother is setting the numbers to the right combination. Not a bad thing, just inconvenient which I guess helps out. I will be buying more for the price, I think something like this should be mandatory for every gun. Especially homes with children."
1,Trigger Lock Proves Ineffective,"Following the instructions provided with the Master Lock Model 94 trigger lock I reset the combination and then locked this trigger lock around the trigger on my very popular bolt action rifle and was shocked to discover, after cocking the empty rifle, that I was then able to easily pull back on the trigger lock and pull the trigger. I proceeded to try it again and again, upside down and backwards, squeezing the lock as tightly as humanly possible, and no matter what I did I was able to pull the trigger simply by wiggling the trigger lock."
4,Easy to use and I feel more secure,I bought these after recent events in the news. It made me feel like I was doing something about gun violence. Overall they were easy to install and easy to change the code.
5,Sturdy Construction,"Well, it does what it's supposed to do. I love it and it will protect from my little ones shooting my gun so that's all I care about. Great construction though...very sturdy. This is one investment that should last you a long time....if not a lifetime."
5,NICE!!!!!,Very good lock to pare with the lock-box that I also purchased here on Amazon. I like to for the access do to not having to have a key on hand
4,A little cheap but works as intended,"The title says it all. The fit and finish is nothing to write home about, but it will keep your firearm safe during transport. The only real downside is the limited number of combos available, but for the price that's a minor issue."
5,Made it fit perfectly.,"At first when i put it on my 12 gauge Benelli Nova i did not think it was going to work. BUT do not give up, if you are careful and you pay attention to which of the rubbed spikes you need to remove you can simply slice them off and make it fit nice and snug. I also had to cut a small half circle in the outer rubber for my button safety to fit. After i did this it fit amazingly and did its job."
3,Not very impressed,"I bought a couple of these to lock shotguns. They work OK but overall feel of the combination wheels doesn't give me the impression that they're very sturdy or will last a long time. After playing with them a bit, decided to just leave them off the guns until I was sure they wouldn't ""change"" combinations on me. They remind me of those cheesy locks on suitcases. I'll try them for a while before putting into use on a gun."
4,Four out of five's not bad,I bought five and four worked well. I have them and depend on them every day. They work fine. The fifth -- oh well! It just didn't work and I didn't care. (Too much).
5,Works great,The cost is low and you do not need a key. Works great for keeping my Ruger P85 safe even if found by little hands
3,Good Lock,The attractions of this lock was that I would not have to fumble around with a key should I need to unlock my gun in a hurry and that I could set my own combination. Setting the combination was a little trying (having to hold a pencil in place while changing the numbers) but do-ible. It took a little practice to get the lock in the right place on the triger guard when locking it. The best position was with the cross bar back as far as possible. Again not a big problem (the instructions were of little help in this). All in all a good lock for the money.
1,Don't buy it = Use Cable Lock Instead,"I bought this for my Glock 17 9x19 9mm handgun and this lock should not be used. For starters, you cannot put the lock behind the trigger. It has to go in front of the trigger to work. This causes the lock to be able to engage the trigger, thus making it able to be fired. Second and finally, the combination is very hard to set and I managed to brick mine so that it did not recognize any combinations. Luckily, it was not on my handgun at the time. What a waste of $12. I recommend you look up Project ChildSafe and get a free gun lock from your local sheriff or police department. Also, many handguns come with cable gun locks from now on that are way more effective."
3,"Good lock, hard to set","I purchased this lock and the ""Club Brand Combination Gun Trigger Lock"" to compare the two. I believe both are good locks and would adequetely keep your firearms safe from children or others from using them. I found this lock to be difficult to set the combination and difficult to turn the dial to unlock it. The Club Brand lock was easy to set the combination and is easy to turn the dials to unlock it. I will be purchasing more of the Club Brand for my other firearms."
2,doesn't work well with lever-action rifles.,"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However, on my two lever-action rifles, it's not very effective -- probably no surprise, given the design. On an older Winchester 94, I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together, with some effort. On a Winchester 9422, it attaches itself to the trigger guard, and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded, cocked, and fired with the lock still in place."
5,Easy Access Lock,"This is a good quality gun lock that uses a combination instead of a key, which is useful if you don't want to have to carry around a bunch of keys. The downside is that it's slightly bulkier than the key version. It is sometimes hard to spin just one row without bumping the others, but I find if you first spin the middle one to the proper number, then the side ones, its easy to avoid."
5,It works,"This is pretty easy to use. It does secure very weIl.This is not intended for emergency use. I've looked at locks that can be released quickly for emergencies, but they were too expensive for me so I practiced with this lock. With some careful planning and practice, I could remove the lock in 3-5 seconds. The key is not to scramble the numbers too far. It's not perfect, but if you need less than 3 seconds to bring your piece to bear, I suspect that you are pretty much screwed already."
2,Last digit would not set.,"The last digit would not set. This means that my combination ""must"" end with a ""0"".To return it, I would have to spend about as much as it originally cost."
5,Excellent gun lock,"I have tried all sorts of gun locks, keyed locks, locks that come with firearms when you buy them generally stink. Of all the combo and special key locks I have tried this is without a doubt the best I have used. Smooth, easy to read, easy to operate and absolutely prevents pulling the trigger. The perfect lock when you have children in the house but need to keep a weapon or two out of the gun safe."
4,Doesn't fit Walther P99,"I really liked the product = inexpensive, easy to use, seemingly well made, excellent visual deterrent, etc...But I just couldn't make it ""work"" on my Walther P99. Maybe because of the bilateral magazine releases, maybe because of the shape of the trigger guard, who knows...If it ""fits"" your pistol it'll probably be perfect for your needs..."
2,Gun Lock,"Good Product. Holding the Pin in to set the code is a pain in the backside though. Had one that was not set right. Spent some time going through the numbers to pick the lock, if you can imagine that. It would be nice to see a commom screw slot or something like that to turn do you can set the combination. If you have the shakes or one hand you are SOL."
1,DO NOT BUY,It took less then 10 minutes for my 8 year old neice to figure out how to open & remove it without the combination. Poorly designed & built.
1,Don't read if you are suicidal,Don't read this book if you are suicidal. It will not relieve your pain. It is far too academic and not helpful at all to suicidal people. Recommended only for professionals.
2,Spends a lot of time pointing out the obvious,"I did a quick read of this book and I thought he spends a lot of time pointing out the obvious; really, suicide occurs due to ""psychological Pain"", what a shocker. I just didn't find it all that insightful. There were a few insights that made me think but not many."
1,Insulting. Myopic. This author LOVES suicide.,"I must admit, I only read the introduction and pages provided in the ""Look inside this book"", but what I read I found to be insulting, myopic, and plagued with the god-complex that afflicts so many doctors.First, his tone and enthusiasm for suicide is insulting to those who are either survivors of suicide or have ever been touched by this tragic death in any way. Not only does this psychologist live in a self-aggrandized bubble, his dismission of scientific study and proven evidence of the etiology of the suicidal mind reveals his ""psychake"" narcissism. I'm glad he loves his profession and work so much, but the complexities of human behavior and illness can rarely be fully laid bare by one specialist."
1,NOT a ladies watch,"WristKing advertised this item as a ladies watch, but it has a huge case. When I requested an RMA, the customer service 'bot replied saying that ""It's advertised as a men's watch on Amazon, but it is ""OK"" as a ladies watch. He either didn't read the online description or just fabricated this to justify the 10% restocking charge. Their add states:""Premium Swiss made watch is sleek, racy and just right for today's modern woman, Impressive polished steel tank case ....""No where in the description did it say anything about this ""really"" being a men's watch. I won't do business with these folks again.-I. Diehl"
4,Not bad!,"Rating out of ten...1) Gore: 7 (less-than-graphic gore, much of it is implied. Some interesting zombie-killing techniques!)2) Make-up: 5 (your basic grey-skinned zitty zombies in this one, nothing spectacular)3) Effects: 7. Good blood spurts and dismemberment action, nicely done.4) Acting: 8. I watched the dubbed version, and although the ""American"" voices are a bit overdone (as usual), the actors seemed capable.Overall: 7/10. Some of the humor is Far Eastern. If you've seen a Steven Chow movie you know what I'm talking about. But that also gives you a little different color to the comedy. Not a bad little zombie film!"
3,Biozombie is okay...,"Biozombie aims to be comical, and succeeds for the most part as the story of zombie contamination slowly develops. By the second half, the film converts to a zombie film, the first half is mostly character development, having very little to do with zombies, more about light comedy. It's all about two troublemakers in a really small mall, with long, narrow halls lit blue. Don't picture a 'Dawn' mall is all.So regarding the zombies and gore? Good zombie count by the end, with very little gore. The zombie make-up is decent at best. Bottomline, this is a comedy first."
2,Not That Good,"This movie has a handful of funny moments, but not enough to recommend you buy this. The budget is miniscule, and it shows... literally, you can see the edges of the zombie makeup. There are no scares and the jokes are too few and very far between. The dubbing is where most of the laughs come from. If you are looking for a dose of splatter, the closest thing to gore in this film is the aforementioned pancake-zombie makeup. Other than that, it is more-or-less blood free. It's maybe a worth seeing as a budget rental, but there's is nothing here you will want to see over again that would make it worth owning."
2,I Still Hate It....,"I love bad movies and I have all kinds of endurance for camp. I love zombie movies and gore. I love foreign movies and I am not bothered by subtitles or badly dubbed ""Engrish"" as the menu puts it. So it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you to click that remove button and take this bad boy out of your queue. There's no nudity and the violence is on par with an episode of Celebrity Boxing. Are you still reading? Okay, fine--here's the formula: (Mallrats - wit) + (Dawn of the Dead - interesting characters and logic) x stupid = Bio Zombie. I hated all of the characters and actually cheered for the zombies every time they made a grab for them. Better zombie movies for you: Zombi 3 (terrible, but much better than this) or Return of the Dead (campier and more nekkid-ness). The only remarkable thing about this movie is its ability to make me hate it two days after the viewing."
1,Lousy piece of film..,"This film has blood and gore, but it is so incredibly stupid that Bio-Zombie is not fun to watch. I could'nt finish watching this mess of a movie due to the bad acting and stupid characters.Watch this after taking two aspirin."
3,moon wasnt full when this 1 was recorded!!,been a big krokus fan for years never saw them live thought headhunter was best of all some things were missing on this one and cant quite figure it out 1. maybe this group isnt good live... 2 lineup changes steve pace was the drummer on headhunter did a heck of a job chris von rohr left the band some time before this live recording 3. maybe the chemistry wasnt right i rate this at a real low 3!!!
4,They're funnels. They funnel things. What can I say?,"Don't use them for hot liquids and you should be good to go. They're plastic; hopefully the potential buyer would know better than to buy them for something like that. For what I use them for, they are adequate. No more spices or other ingredients going all over the place as I try to pour them into a storage bottle.Like I said. They're funnels. They funnel. LOL!"
2,These are very small funnels,"I wish that there was an image with size comparison with a measuring cup. These are very small and should only be used for liquids. Flour, beans, etc don't flow easily."
5,Its a funnel.,Not sure how one can mess up a funnel but these people did not. There was nothing wrong with them and the plastic was smooth.
5,Serves it's purpose,"We drink alot of water in our household and we find it easier to fill up large waterbottles (3 cups) than constantly refilling glasses. We have a brita pitcher, so filling up a bottle usually takes patience and a steady hand, but not anymore! Slap on a funnel and let the waterworks begin!The funnels are exactly what you would expect. Plastic, round, ... funnel-shaped. No real problems. The holes are appropiately shaped and not too small. Would be great for oil changes, etc."
3,These are so tiny,"So, I actually didn't purchase these for my kitchen--I bought them to transfer hair care products etc from the gallon sized containers to bottles that can easily go in the shower. The funnels are small. Like, crazy small. So small that even if I didn't want thick conditioner to fall through them, and I wanted to use them in my kitchen, I'm not sure what I'd do with them small.I will freely admit that perhaps the description says how big they are but I'm not really an expert on knowing what size that will mean in real life. So this poor review could just be my poor choice."
4,Funnels,Product is exactly as I expected. Use funnels for many things (I am not too careful). Would purchase again when needed.
2,Only For Liquids,The openings of these funnels are very narrow. They can only be used for thin liquids. I tried to use them for finely ground spices and they clogged right up.
3,Good not great,"This album is good but not as good as Night Ripper. It flows really well for the most part but sometimes it gets a little choppy and disorganized. Also, the main thing that makes it not good is poor song selection for the mixes. The last thing that I don't like about it is that the songs dont flow together between tracks like they do in Night Ripper. Each track fades out (not each song in the track, dont get confused)"
2,Not nearly as good as i expected,"Huge Girl Talk fan, but after listening to ""Night Ripper"" over and over ""Unstoppable"" just pales in comparison, and isn't even on the same level. This CD is good for die-hard fans, but if not then stick to his newer stuff which is drastically better.-AD"
3,Girl Talk - Unstoppable,"Girl Talk continues his copyright-smashing onUnstoppable, a marked improvement overSecret Diary. He's starting to pull his ideas together here, so that ""All Eyes on Me"" has a solid line to unify its snips and cuts. The dirty-minded ""Non-Stop Party Now"" has some of his (soon-to-be-famous) juxtapositions coming in; ""Bodies Hit the Floor"" continues this, with the overly delicate Lisa Loeb crashing into the club. The glitchiness, for the most part, has disappeared, and the edits are much more carefully timed. The album goes by relatively quick, thanks to all the chopping, but it's a fun ride while it lasts."
2,"Too repetitive, not memorable","I found this album to be too repetitive. The sampling is not as fun or as memorable as that on 'Night Ripper'. Some of the tracks have an overall more melodic sound, but that doesn't make an interesting album. 'Night Ripper' was extremely creative and innovative, while this one felt at times like background sounds from something more interesting."
5,Girl Talk is amazing,"Unstoppable is not Girl Talk's best album - that honor belongs to ""Feed the Animals"" but it is defintly a close second. I won't bore you with who Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis) is - you can check wikipedia for that - but I will tell you that if you like his stuff - get this album, you won't regret it."
5,Great Knife!,"Great knife ,holds an edge pretty good , great steel, handle is very comfortable in hand and doesn't slip. But they should have put serrations on back of blade.But overall a GREAT knife!"
5,Overall great knife,"This is a great smaller survival knife. It is not an overly large knife so if you are going to buy this in the thought that it is a huge Rambo like knife, then this is not what you are looking for. I was able to baton this through some smaller pieces of wood to create kindling very easily. As well the TiNi coating on the blade is great. After using it to baton through the wood, all I simply had to do was wipe the blade clean with a cloth and it looked as though it was brand new from the factory. The handle on the blade is very nice and feels very sturdy in your hand, and will not slip like other similar handles when wet. The sheath with the knife is just great. Kydex is a great option for any knife. Although, if you are looking for a sheath that has more compartments to hold something like a multitool, then you will definitely want to get the nylon sheath. Overall very happy with this knife."
5,My fav knife,"I carry this whenever I camp, hike or hunt. Very sharp and stays sharp. Just big enough to do the job without making you look like little Rambo. Mine came with the sheath that can also carry a leatherman tool. I immediately put it in and now I know exactly where both are. I elected not to get the serrated version as if I want a saw, i carry a saw. I have several other knives with serration, and they have never been of any use to me. I guess someone else may disagree, and that is ok. It's just my preference. Price was right and it is one tough knife. If you want a Rambo knife with a compass and sutures and other craker jack prizes and the knife is a foot long, then this knife is not for you. If you want a knife that can do the job and stays sharp, this is it."
4,SOG PUP ELITE..GOOD KNIFE,"I PURCHASED THIS KNIFE THINKING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CHEEZY PIECE OF METAL FOR THE PRICE I PAID, I WAS IMPRESSED!!!"
4,"Nice Knife, Ok Sheath","This is one heck of a knife. It has great balance and feels good in the hand. I like the kydex sheath, but I really don't care for the way that the sheath mounts to a belt. Could have done better there. Overall, a great knife."
2,defective blade,"I boght 2 of the Sog knives,the FSA8 Flash II folding knife and I love it-never leave home without it,But the Seal pup Elite E37S-K with the kydex sheath has severe problems with the blade.The notch in the sheath where you can cut rope and the blade is exposed is rusted where the notch is and it also has several nicks in the blade.I have never used the knife but was planning on a winter camping trip when I noticed the nicks-they are not small nicks but 3 nice size gouges,to big to try to sharpen out as I dont want to damage the blade further.The return date is expired so I am stuck with it.My warning to anyone who is thinking of buying one, Please check it as soon as it arrives so you wont have the same problem.I dont know what kind of metal the blade is made out of but I dont think I'll buy another.. Eric"
5,"Great knife, go with the nylon sheath","Great knife, good weight and feel. Grippy handle. I don't like the Kydex sheath, should have chosen the nylon. The kydex is very tight fitting and slightly rubbing off the black coating on the spine of the blade. It is very durable but the nylon is much easier in normal use. Highly recommend the knife."
3,Decent knife! But wanted more quality...,"Okay, this is my first real knife! I purchased this along with a Gerber LMF II debating between the two at the same time. I don't know alot about knives, but I do have to say that these are two completely different knives to an average consumer. If I had to pick one, I would buy the Gerber LMF again. (See my review on the Gerber LMF II.) This knife is very light. Wished it had a little more weight, but that may be the purpose for this style of knife. The handle is more of a hard plastic and I wished that a little more quality was put in the handle. The blade itself is indeed well made. I ended up getting the straight edge. I can't say much for the hip belt sheath that I got it with. Again, I wish that it had more of a pro quality sheath and it seemed more like a toy sheath made of fiberglass to me."
4,Loop-de-loop,"Released at a time when dance music was running out of innovative ideas, this takes a section of the 1991 Roxette hit ""Fading Like a Flower"" and transforms it into a first-rate floorfill"
3,An end to the Anne of Green Gables Series,"The main reason I gave the movie 3 stars was because it was about my favorite character Anne Shirley. I guess the most disappointing thing about it was that it did not take place on Prince Edwards Island but in War torn Europe. I would have preferred to see Anne and Gilbert finally in a real relationship. Maybe focus on them after World WarI. Also the idea that Anne is no longer living in Green Gables is kind of sad. I know Colleen Duhurst passed away a few years ago and so it made since to have her character pass away as well. I was happy to see some of the old characters like Dianna Barry, Anne's best friend. If you are new to Anne of Green Gables series and not completly enthralled with it I would say skip this movie. But if you are like me die hard life long fan the see the movie, it will not be as enchanting as the first two but it will put closer on the series."
5,Does what it was designed to....,Works like a champ....Just be sure to plug any holes in the head if you do the valves on the engine otherwise you will likely end up dropping your oil pan to get them back....
5,This is one of those tools that makes an otherwise painful job much less painful.,"I've use this tool on several heads now, including some with much stiffer than stock aftermarket springs, and it has been a great boon to aid removal and installation of the keepers very efficiently. I LOVE this tool."
1,not god enough,"this item will actually get the valvespring off easily, but not without risking to damage the cylinder arround the spring.The real letdown is that it is impossible to reassemble the valvesprings with it. It can't be don without damaging the cylinder or breaking or loosing the spring retainers. It is just too risky. Don't use it. I bought it and it gave nothing but headache. You can get a tool to do the job reliably and also without removing the top of the engine. I gave this one star, but only because i had to inorder to submit this review."
1,Does not work on mitsubishi / DSM,if you are buying this as a cheap alternative to the Blue point GA317 don't bother. this is not the correct tool. the nose on the installer is far too big to re-seat the keepers. this lisle tool work fine to remove the keeper but not to reinstall. used this for 2 hours trying to get Mitsubishi 3000gt keepers back in place. Waste of time and money (for that application). i ended up going back to my trusty Schley (SCH91410) valve spring compressor tool and all was well.
5,just what I needed,"Nothing helps motorcycle repair or maintentance like the right tool for the job. Thanks good price, good tool, received on time"
3,Craig David needs to break out something new.,"This cd is okay, anything else you read is stretching it.You just can't like someone's music to a fault like I think some of these reviewers did. The formula works with a certain fan base. If he wishes to expand it, he needs to take some chances.Craig David's third cd is no different than the first or second one. Don't believe me...wait 'til you listen to it and then let's discuss.The songs that do stand out are:1) ALL THE WAY - will make a great remix.2) DON'T LOVE YOU NO MORE(I'M SORRY) - will make females all over the world cry and eat ice cream!!!4) SEPARATE WAYS - my favorite song.7) ONE LAST DANCE - listen with loved one.8) UNBELIEVABLE - is just that...smooth."
5,Recommend Seller,Could not find this CD anywhere. Pricing was reasonable and received item very fast in perfect condition. Would buy from again in the future.
5,Classic,"What can I say, its a classic craig david album. Am a big fan of his music. If you like good music, this is the album to get. My favorite songs are Hypnotic, Seperate Ways and Johnny."
1,Not what I expected.,This is a total of 50 targets (5 sheets of 10 targets per sheet) not a package of 50 sheets of targets.
2,50 pack of targets NOT 50 pack of sheets!,"This should not be valled 50 pack. It is in fact a 5 pack. Each sheet has ten targets for a total of 50 targets. Very misleading! That being said, I love the Sight-N-C targets. Highly visible, self adhesive and reasonably priced."
1,Description is a lie,Item is listed as 50 pk shoot-n-c self-adhesive target variety pack. Item is only 5 sheets. I guess they are getting the 50 pack listing for the 50 tip of your thumb sized stickers. This package at any other retailer is $5-$7 for the FIVE pack. Just like this one is really a FIVE pack not Fifty.
3,Distance Education: A LONG time ago,"This book is no longer timely. It was published/copyrighted in 2005. The information that it contains is no longer applicable to modern distance/virtual learning. The author downplays audio and video streaming related to distance learning because in 2005 it was not as prevalent. Futhermore, it does not take into account the trend of ALL colleges and universities moving in this direction.The systems view information regarding course design is good - but everything else is outdated.I recommend you find another book that is more timely."
5,Gets the floor clean fast,"If you want to mop up quick and get on with more exciting things in life, then you have to get this mop. The refills are now impossible to find in the stores, so I had the handle but no longer able to find refills. The fact I had to go online to find the refills shows strangely odd dedication to a mop. But what I like about it is that because it is so light, you can get the floor mopped up very quickly! That's what makes it the best mop I ever had in the many years of the drudgery of floor cleaning."
2,"This toy look nice, but it is only for much older children because it is a health hazard for little ones.","We purchased this for a three year old who is into fire trucks and firemen, but when it arrived we realized that it is too easy for it to be a choking hazard, so we are keeping it for later."
2,Lacks Clarity,"After reading the three 5 stars reviews about this book I expected a lot and was disapponted. The subject matter is an important and extremely difficult one. Experience of life with it preconceptionel depth will have to be granted its importance if we want to become healthier beeings. Eugene Gendlin tries to bring a better balance between the lived and the thought : ""Meaning is formed in the interaction of experiencing and something that functions as a symbol. Feeling without symbolization is blind; symbolisation without feeling is empty."" And there are other coragious thoughts in there. But as a whole to me her approach lacks clarity and elegance."
1,Sick and Insensitive,"This is nothing but propaganda attempting to be funny, but ending up being sick and insensitive. Michael Moore obviously has his own political agenda and has a truly warped way of cramming his viewpoint down your throat. The ultimate effect is the opposite of what he probably intended, you end up wanting nothing to do with this man and feel ashamed for ever sharing an opinion with him. One thing it is not: funny."
1,Unbiased --- Not!,"Mr Moore claims he is a non-partisan, what an awful lie! He builds his whole premise on finding truth, but what he actually does is wear a non-partisan cloak to bash and demote Republican conservative agendas while promoting Liberal Democrat ideals. Take no heed to his deceit. Make your own choice and see the grimy veneer this man wears: he is a bleeding Liberal. make no mistake and be your own thinker."
1,He Hates America,"Freedom of Speech is wonderful. It is also nice that we can show our disapproval for someone's actions by not financing them. Don't buy Mr. Moore's products. What was that nonsense that he pulled at the Academy Awards. Thankfully, most of us didn't watch it and missed his unwelcomed rant. Too bad for Mr. Moore's career that it was replayed again and again."
5,Free Speech,"Many thanks to the ""reviewer"" who, like all of the flag-waving, jingoistic fascists demands that we supress any dissent and has the audacity to decide what's ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""correct"" expression. I count myself among those who love the America our founding fathers envisioned, not the America of McCarthy and Nixon. The McNixons want us all to shut up and tell us what to do, or say, or buy if we ""love America"". Well, I love America so much I'm buying Michael Moore's work; and I'm STAYING in America and fighting for America and it's flag, despite what the counter-revolutionary Stalinistas want - a silent, compliant, slave-state."
5,have fun and revolt at the same time!,"If you're a Michael Moore fan, this is essential for you. Roger & Me should probably be the first thing you see, but after that the best thing I think would be the first season of the Awful Truth. Moore goes after all the targets you thought needed to be attacked, and a few you wouldn't have thought of. (Who outside of Ohio had heard of that chicken coop with 11 million birds?) If you're liberal at all, you'll have a ton of fun seeing Moore heading into corporate headquarters and demanding a change (his specialty) and, surprisingly, getting his way a lot of times, going after those pesky Clinton impeachment folk, and otherwise trying to give the working man his fair share. You'll be a better person having seen it."
4,Satire for the bold and the brave,"I had never heard of this series before and, being a fan of Michael Moore, I decided to buy this earlier this year.If I could rate each disc, I'd give the first disc 5 stars and the second 4 stars.There are many memorable and bizarre moments in the series, and some of the skits are so simple and effective that I kept saying, ""why didn't I think of that?"". As you'd expect, the first season is overflowing with the populist, blunt, political and social satire that has made Michael Moore famous.If it weren't for some of the distasteful skits, such as ""Teen Sniper School"" (not funny), I'd give this five stars, as it's otherwise a low-budget, but very straightforward and eye-opening series. I recommend this set to fans of Michael Moore or people looking for some good and funny exposés on corporate America."
5,Highly Enjoyable,"Michael Moore is sort of a hero of mine. He takes on causes that are impossible, and gets results. The way does it is shocking (and often very funny), but for one reason or another it works. The Awful Truth shows him taking on these causes, and keeping big corperations honest. It urges you to become more active in the political world around you, and helps you to realize that what this country needs is less political apathy, and more political awareness. Michael Moore is a Genius, and seeing this helps you understand why."
5,Michael Moore makes me laugh,"it is that simple. in everything he says and does, he takes it to the extreme..and that is a refreshing, and very humorous, change."
3,"When he's good he's good, when he's bad...","Michael Moore can be very funny. Some of the brilliant bits in this DVD set are, e.g., the ""witch hunt"" segment, the ""I need a pancreas"" segment, the ""beat the rich"" segment, the ""voice box choir"" segment, and a few others. Many of the other segments are misfires--some like the one with Hitler in Zurich or the Debt Collector are simply embarrassingly bad.I don't have cable, so I will wait for the next season to come out on DVD, but I hope the ""quality assurance standards"" go up a bit. Some serious re-examination needs to be done. Things need to be thought out a bit more. I get the feeling Michael Moore prefers to improvise, but with a little preparation (or perhaps some better editing) the show could be a lot better. I fondly remember the consistent quality of TV Nation. What happened?"
5,Correcting an earlier review,"A previous reviewer (Sven) mentioned that the book omitted some more advanced topics. 1 of the examples cited was how to access MasterPage properties from a content page. Not only is this information there (page 263), but there are 2 examples, and the specific location is referenced in the Table of Contents as ""Working with Controls and Properties from the Master Page""Just thought I'd mention this since I chose to go w/ another book because of that review, only to find as I sit here and browse this book that it does in fact go into a good amount of detail. I hope the one I did order is as good."
3,"Lots of information, missing some advanced topics","The book covers a lot of ground and does most of it very well. It's both good as a reference and as a tutorial.Unfortunately, some of the advanced topics are left out. When discussing Master Pages, the book does not mention how to get a strongly-typed Master property in the Page object. (Use the MasterPageFile page directive.) When discussing configuration of ASP.NET applications, the authors have one paragraph mentioning the possibility of encrypting configuration file contents, but omit showing how to do it. (Use aspnet_regiis -p[e|d](f).)Overall, for such a thick book, I would have expected more advanced content. However, as a book for programmers with some experience to make the step to ASP.NET 2.0, I think it's right on the mark."
4,Good Introduction or Reference,"As context, I programmed in classic ASP and had experience with Java and VB.NET prior to purchasing this book, but I had not really worked with ASP.NET. I found this book an easy read, very clear, and broken up nicely to that I can use it as a reference. The examples are especially helpful, as they contain just enough context for each concept, but are not so specific that I have trouble translating them to match my own needs."
2,Not for professionals!,"What I expect from series ""professionals"" - is not covering all topics on a level ""how to drag a control from toolbox"" but a deep discussion(why(background), what(internals) and how(valuable examples)) on the most important and difficult topics of the domain, using ""real-life"" examples(the examples in the book are useless).The content lacks a holistic approach(don't like collected stories). Let it be not an all-in-all tutorial but some concept and in-depth material on the most significant topics.(though the publisher won't benefit from this kind of strategy - it's always better to write a dozen of books of one domain than having one may be two volumes covering essentials).A very(!) good example of book for professionals(asp.net 1.1) - is the book of Fritz Onion - ""Essential ASP.NET With Examples in C#"".Overall the book is good(for beginners) or for upgrading from previous version of asp.net(though it could have been more compact then)."
3,Inconsistent quality,"About 2/3 of this book is quite well written and easy to follow. Those sections are logical and have good examples. The rest of the book is noticably less well written. Unfortunately the chapters on Authentication and Authorization, especially on the new Login server controls is one of these. I actually came to amazon.com to see if Microsoft Press has anything on the new 2005 server controls. The section of the book that drove me here is the one on customizing the create user server control which simply doesn't work and isn't explained well enough to let me figure out what's wrong. In fact it's barely explained at all."
2,Not so professional as the title says,"I dont know why Wrox titled this book Professional ASP.NET 2.0. There is nothing in this book that professionals can gain from. Authors dont even bother giving you some best practices of professional programming. They start with the VS2005 IDE description and go on with explaining of all there is to explain for controls and other features of ASP.NET 2.0 programming but all examples use the minimal implementation. I was waiting to see any trick or customize solution but couldn't find any. I think the most important part of the ASP.NET 2.0 is Membership, Roles and Profiles, but I could not find anything in this book to help me more then what MSDN already has. At least MSDN has some examples of how to write your own providers.To conclude, this book is a reference book, but not for profesionals."
1,Not quite ready for prime time!,"If this is the Professional version I really wonder what the Beginning version is like.I found the book to be extremely disappointing.....unfortunately I couldn't give it a zero.A few examples:1. The index is absolutely useless. For example, you won't find MultiView or the Wizard Server Control in the index.2. I couldn't find anything on the RowCommand which is associated with the GridView and the replacement for the ItemCommand. Definitely something that should be part of any discussion on GridView.3. Strongly Typed DataSets and ObjectDataSources are not mentioned!4. Most of the examples I looked at are so basic as to be worthless.MSDN and Google will give you much better information than you will find in this book."
2,ASP.Net newbies need to stay away from this book,"Don't say I did not warn you, this book is not for ASP.NET newbies. I'm fairly good with VB.NET and yet I simply can't use this book to learn ASP.Net. You will not even get past the first few pages.Another thing I don't like about this book is that it dives into technical details without give you the whole picture about what is a proper ASP.Net website.After reading this book you would not have a concept in your mind about how to build an ASP.Net. It's just bits here and bits there."
3,"Good Story, but Hyper-Aggravating Style","Piers Anthony's ambitious novel tells the story of a man who moves between worlds of science fiction and fantasy, assuming different powers in each. The worlds coalesce toward the end of the novel. One fascinating element of the story is a competition called The Game, played among serfs in the science fiction world. In it, a player can be randomly called upon to compete in any realm of human endeavor, from ballet to math problems to sword fighting.Unfortunately, the book is written throughout in a maddeningly over-explantory style, along the lines of ""He stopped for a drink of water. Water is used to quench thirst, and drinking is performed by swallowing liquid."" (not an actual quote). I find it mind-boggling to think that any editor could have accepted this. I could probably myself reduce the book from 790 to 500 pages without leaving out a single detail. Too bad."
3,Above the law good but not at best,Well 4 the funk of it is really the only good song here but try another one of there albums cuz there are solid A.T.L.albumz out there.
1,4 THE FUNK OF IT,"NOT A SOILD EP AT ALL. I REMBER WHEN IT HIT I WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED. BUT WHEN ""BLACK MAFFIA"" LIFE HIT I KNEW ATL WAS ALIVE AND WELL. IF YOU ARE A TRUE ATL FAN PURCHASE THIS CD "" FOR THE FUNK OF IT."""
5,Dionysian Mozart!,"For all those who know about Robert Casadesus, it 's useless to remark his innumerable musical gifts. His accurate phrasing, clear intonation, mastery fingering and sense of the musicality. Casadesus has been a beacon for countless pianists all over the world and so great audiences through the times.His Mozart is crystalline, joyous, triumphal and incandescent. In this glorious year of the 250th anniversary of Salzburg 's prodigal son, it would be a wise decision to look for all what he had recorded about Mozart. At this moment Amazon France is offering an interesting set. So please, don' t hesitate just a second and go for these treasured recordings."
3,The content is great! But the quality is awful!!!,It is a great supportive material for people who play hockey professionally and recreationally.The only problem is I had to return my purchase because of the DVD quality. Every 10-15 seconds the picture just freezes throughout all session. I thought something was wrong with my DVD or I got defected DVD so I returned it hoping that a replacement would help and it didn't!!! Same problem!! All my other DVDs work perfectly but this one. I had to return it indefinitely :(
1,Stupid Movie,"This movie suck...first the comedy is not even funny, they'll do anything to make you laugh. The acting is horrible, the fight scene suck, none of these actor know how to fight. Princess Phoenix is the most annoying person in the world. Avoid this movie at all cost."
2,far from a real duel,"after reading a lot of reviews this movie seemed to have mixed emotions from a few folks, so i rented it instead of buying it, and thank god i did. this movie is bad. there is zero kung fu or real sword play in this movie. the title is very misleading.this is a cheesy comedy at best. i give it one star because i laughed a few times, i gave it the second star because Zhao Wei is in the film, one of the hottest woman on earth. don't buy this movie thinking its going to look great next to Hero and CTHD and Iron Monkey, this movie is crap compared to those films. did i mention everone flys around like superman? rent before you buy is all i can say."
4,"Enjoyable, even if it isn't your usual fare...","As an American watching a translation, it's sometimes difficult to determine a film-maker's intent. Ever since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" we in the West have had to re-evaluate martial arts cinema--it's not always about revenge. Sometimes, it seems pretty inexplicable. You know-- different culture, different philosophy, etc. (That's what I'm told, anyway. Since I don't speak Chinese, I couldn't exactly say WHAT gets lost in translation.)Regardless of culture or genre, the big question always has to be: did you like the movie?Well, yes, I liked it. I don't know if I get all of it, but I liked it. The action sequences and special effects are soundly executed without taking over the film. The actors are enjoyable to watch, and I actually got the jokes (there were many). At the end of the movie, I felt like I'd watched a story, and not just fluff. There was a theme and hidden plot behind all those flying people with swords. You gotta like that."
5,duel,i own this movie on vhs and i must say that it's one of my all time best it is up there with storm riders and crouching tiger hidden dragon is u like sword fight's u will love this movie it is a must have cheng from man called hero is one of the best swords play fighter's i have seen so for all u storm rider fans and man called hero fans get reserve your copie as soon as you can.
4,Worth renting,"Horrible plot. Lots of holes in the plot. Lots of special effects to cover up the bad sword fighting. All the swordfights can be seen in the trailer. Definitely not a movie for swordfighting fans. Good things about this film: wonderful cast, good acting, nice scenery, very good soundtrack, enjoyable comedy, cgi well done (but at times pointless). Bad things: A lot of holes in the plot, no good sword fightings, mostly special effects. Basically, I don't recommend this movie, the trailer is hyped. What you see in the trailer are pretty much all the ""good"" sword fighting that you're gonna see...."
3,Good Visual Effect,"If you're looking for a good martial art or a good sword's play movie, i don't recommand you this movie. Like Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero, the quality of this movie is relied on the visual effects done by computer. The story is ok but nothing special. Briefly, this movie is fun to watch but may not worth to buy. But if you are a fan of Ekin chen and love nice visual effects, go for it !!!"
5,Duexellent,"This is an awesome movie, It's funny and has some pretty cool effects. I like the way the chinese make the martial artists fly... it isn't real but makes for good fantasy. I mean you can only punch and kick a guy in so many ways. This movie also has a good story to it, its kinda modern and kinda in the past. It is a must see. And definately buy it. It's worth it. 5 Stars"
2,A disappointment,"This film has good scenery and costumes, a decent plot, but ruined by juvenile humor and juvenile characters. If you enjoy watching juvenile, pouting adults talking through 75% of a movie, then perhaps this movie is for you. The CG effects in the fight scenes were not particularly impressive; ""A Man Called Hero"" had much better CG effects. This is really too bad, because the production value of this film (e.g., sets and costumes) is quite high by H.K. standards."
1,Bad Book,"""Night Riders: Defending Community in the Black Patch"" lacks important details of the Black Patch War.The only thing I enjoyed about the book was the photos that I have never seen before. The author goes out of his way to try to unjustly inject racism into the Black Patch War, when in truth, the Black Patch War was about tobacco. If you want to learn the full, true story of the Night Riders, I suggest you buy ""On Bended Knee"" by Bill Cunningham."
3,Nautical jewelry,This charm bracelet is cute. The charms are larger I thought than they looked in the photo. I found it too cumbersome but my little girl enjoys it.
5,excellent,Everything about this transaction was great. Mom and I play the Wheel of Fortune all the time and we love it.ThanksJennifer Breithaupt
1,Dont Bother,Thank you for reminding me to return it. It has been sitting in the box since day one. It is not the first one I have purchaced. I have not had any luck with any of the other TV plug in games either. Dont waste your money.
4,So much fun!!!,"I really love this game, I had gotten it as a last-minute stocking stuffer for my husband and it's been such a big hit. It's super easy to use and lots of fun for us to play together. There's the ability to play with up to 3 teams or even by yourself, which is a nice feature.My only negative about it is the cord connecting it to the TV isn't very long and doesn't reach to our couches, so we have to pull up chairs. Otherwise it's lots of fun and super addictive!"
5,Truly brilliant,"The thing about Shumate's poetry is that it is deceptively simple. That is, it reads simply, but both the composition of a good prose poem and the digestion of one are much more complex than first glance would lead a person to believe. There's another review here that mocks the prose poem as a ""you too can write poetry"" or somesuch. Nothing could be further from the truth. The prose poem is, if anything, even more complex because the poet is required to control things, to set tone and pace, without the use of line breaks and traditional stanzas.I came across Shumate's work in _Good Poems for Hard Times_ and sought out all that I could find both online and by buying this book. Don't think twice about it, buy this collection and maybe Shumate will make enough money to write about ten more. We could all use more poetry like this.Buy it already."
3,"A Solid, but not outstanding Collection.","It's pleasing to see an increase in the number of prose poem collections in the past few years, not to say that there haven't been prose poem books published for some time now. While there were a few poems in this collection that I enjoyed, I found overall that Shumate's biggest influence Russel Edson, seems to take over many of the poems and while a sign of influence isn't a bad quality, poets should move ahead on their own, something that doesn't quite happen here. Stronger recent prose poem collections include ""The Invisible Bride"" By Tony Tost and ""You Can Tell The Horse Anything"" by Mary Koncell."
1,You TOO can write poetry!!!,"Ever wonder how to win a writing prize? Be pompous and earnest and pretend to take chances. Frankly, this is appalling drivel. For instance, what did Hemingway learn from Cezanne? How to build sentences like mountains. There's not a mountainous sentence in all of H. The question might be better put: what did David Shuamate learn from Cezanne? --To write with little dots. Sometimes they make a picture but don't look too close, cause it's mostly just pretend. Or one called Plum. If you get anything out of this besides watching the writer being cute, congratulations to you. It's not unpleasant tossing this chunk out the window and taking an afternoon nap instead of reading it."
4,Great Fun,"Alexei Sayle reminds me most of Roald Dahl in his writing style, but updated for the 21st century. There is always a dark brooding element that he brilliantly juxtaposes with his own comic style. A word of advice tho - this book doesn't travel overly well to America unless the audience is Anglophone or has Anglophonic leanings."
5,Better than the picture!,"I coveted this bag a long time. When I bought a new jade yoga mat I decided to treat myself an go all the way. When I opened the bag I realized that the rare occurence of buying smomething and having it be BETTER than you thought it would be just happened. It's spacious withough being obnoxious. I usually take a little notebook and book of poetry to yoga class with me, which will fit, as well as a change of clothes and a water bottle. The color is beautiful. There isn't anything I'd change about this bag."
5,floor dance routine,"I purchased this bag because I took a dance floor routine and my mat was able to fit inside along with pockets for keys, phone, clothes, and etc. Great for my gym workouts."
3,very big,"yes this bag is indeed very big and roomy so you can put anything you wish to. Since I am 5'1"" and 95lb this bag is wayy too big to carry so I give 3 stars."
3,Good bag but awkward,"This really is a great bag if you're carrying a lot of stuff. You could probably even fit a block or two in this bag. The DOWNSIDE is that I found the handles to be really awkward. You can't carry this bag on your back (which is the best place to carry a heavy load.) If you put this bag on your shoulder, you have all of the bulk of your load at your armpit. And if you carry it in your hand, you have the whole weight of your load pulling down on your shoulder. I carry a heavy mat and sometimes have a little walk from parking to class, so weight distribution was important to me."
5,Love this bag!!!,"Before I ordered this yoga bag, I read all the reviews. A few negative reviews said the bag was too small. WHAT? I love this bag. My yoga mat, yoga towel, personal medium sized towel, mat spray, iphone, slim water bottle, keys and washcloth ALL fit in this bag. Very quick and easy to remove my yoga mat. I use this bag solely for my yoga gear. If you're using it for something else maybe I can see it's too small? I dont know. Easy to carry and store in my coat closet or trunk in between yoga sessions. I think it's a great purchase."
2,Rope inside the handle is exposed,"I have to say it's probably my mistake because I expect WaiLana product to be made with exceptional quality. The delivery did come quickly but immediately I have noticed pieces of threads left in the package. So I took my time to clear the threads off the bag with a lint remover. Yes I do like the size of this bags. It roomy enough to fit my mat and towel. But when I drop the handles I was disappointed by the rope inside the handle exposed. Yes, you don't see it when you carry the bag but I see it when I drop the handles to get to my mat. I did receive a quick refund from returning the bag."
4,Shearer's 4 star story,"A book explaining the life of such an incredible player HAD to be interesting, no matter how poorly written, and even if it was in another languege. Luckily, this is very well written and very interesting. And most importantly, its in English. It tells you lots of interesting facts, and tells about his most important achievements, plus some humorous stories. It jumps around a bit, but explains from childhood to just about now, and is well worth reading!"
5,The real deal!!!,"Probably most folks who will look at this book are already believers in animal communication but even for those like me who are, there is an abundance of profound and amazingly touching anecdotes in it.My wife and I have called on Marta for help with our cats on several occasions with great success. As a direct result of reading her previous book we can now often communicate directly with them ourselves. This new book is truely a gem and whichever book you read first, you will likely end up wanting to get the other as well! They are easy to read and understand, and make great gifts! Even children who are too young to be able to read on them on their own can learn to communicate with animals; actually learn more easily than adults.Even if you don't have a live-in companion, animals are all around us and they love it when you make deeper contact with them. If you love animals, this book is a must have!"
4,Good Study Book,This was a favorite text book for one of my classes in Grad school so I was happy to find it again in good to excellent condition. I am looking forward to using it in my papers in the future.
4,Kindle Edition,"FYI the Kindle edition that they have listed here for rent or purchase is NOT the same book. It is the theory and practice of GROUP counseling. I downloaded the sample, that's how I figured it out so just giving others a heads up because I would have been annoyed to have to go through the process of requesting a refund for wrong book when it can be easily avoided."
4,To all those who shun the ancient Indain legends: Beware,A suspenseful tale of an American Indian legend encountering modern day hunters in the deep woods of Canada. The Hunters become the hunted when they wander into the stalking ground of what was believed to be just a myth. Read this once and you may never want to go camping again.
3,Forest monster,"Pretty good book. Takes place in the outdoors, in the mountains. A little slow to get going but it gets good after that. Worth reading."
1,Stinks! Don't think you're saving a buck as this isn't worth it,"Stay away from this product. I bought the 12 pack and as my Canon cartridges started to empty I began replacing them with these. At first I thought all was going well (after only one cartridge) but as I replaced more of them, I saw the photos start to get fuzzier and fuzzier. Not only that but the color was off on them too - I printed a photo I already had printed with the Canon ink and it was way off. The ink also dries more slowly so the photos stay sticky much longer. I am afraid my print head is probably all gooped up too. I think I paid about $22 for the 12 pack which is ridiculous really to think you can buy a quality ink product at under $2 per cartridge. I am a sucker apparently but if any one out there saves themself the trouble, I will feel less bad about my own experience!"
1,Isn't working for me but....,"maybe it's because the directions for using are not clear. Am I supposed to add this to my yeast mixture as it is ""proofing""? So far, I have noticed a difference in my bread."
3,A little disappointed,"The book was rated ""good"" so I expected considerable wear but I was disappointed in that the spine was completely torn off and replaced with some sort of masking tape binding....."
4,A fast and entertaining read.,"""Field of Screams"" was a fast read and a lot of laughs but make no mistake about it, the author wanted to and did show the underbelly of what once our national pastime. I enjoyed the book, however one must remember like most things in life there are two sides to a story and baseball is no different. As a lifetime fan of the game the book did not in any way taint my view of the game of baseball. I still think it's the greatest sport ever devised by man however humans are flawed and baseball is no different. For those of you that have an overly romantic view of the game perhaps you should stay away from the book. But if you are a realist and a baseball fan by all means get this book. It's very entertaining and I think will give you a different insight to a game that parallels the history of our country and the attitudes of our no so distant past."
2,A for content; D- on style,"Field of Screams provides a number of interesting anecdotes about the dark side of baseball. Unless you enjoy being patronized, though, you probably won't like it. The author assumes you've heard none of these stories and comes off as thinking he's superior because HE has. He also thinks he's better than you because you, poor fool, believe there's some romance to baseball. Fear not; Richard Scheinin is here to enlighten you.I've tried to read it three times and put in down in disgust after ten minutes or so each time. If you want a good look at the steamy side of baseball from someone who doesn't come off thinking he's better than you, try Dan Gutman's Baseball Babylon instead."
3,"This is the ""Married with Children"" sitcom of baseball lit.","Although he misses some obvious anecdotes. Did'nt Lou Gehrig travel with his mother on the Yankee road trips? That seems suspect in itself. He also missed the legendary Pete Jakusic of the 1945 St. Louis Browns. One day one armed outfielder Pete Gray asked him to help him tie his shoes. Jakusic replied ""Tie your own shoes, you one armed SOB"". This book is a cynics delight. Hopefully a second edition will one day be released. Albert Belle makes Ted Williams look like a gentlemen. A whole chapter could be written about that."
2,"Good on sites, unreliable on practicalities","I bought this in my local bookstore and tried to use it to plan a weeklong trip to Orkney. Unfortunately, while it helped me decide where to go and what to see, it failed me once I tried to make concrete plans. Many of the B&Bs had changed hands and were no longer accepting guests and those that were had often TRIPLED their prices. Save your money and visit the websites of VisitScotland and Historic Scotland which will do a better job on trip planning for free."
5,A Magical Soundtrack,"I discovered this film late one night on the late, late show back in the early 80's and I was mesmerized, not only by the wonderful stars Sophia Loren and Omar Sharif, (Sophia was at the height of her beauty) but by its incredibly beautiful score. The music bathed the scenes with a magical feeling and sparkle that are hard to describe. This music is so purely beautiful and so from the heart, it can move you to tears or bring hope and laughter. Needless to say I was blown away. I am so happy to own the Piero Piccioni score of ""C'era Una Volta"", I bought it about 6 years ago at Tower Records. I treasure it and if you have the opportunity- buy it; you will not be disappointed. It was amazing, and ""more than a miracle"" that such a beautiful score and movie were created in 1967 in the midst of that turbulent decade, it harks back to a more romantic and gentler era, with larger than life actors and exquisite music.I give it my highest recommendation and rating."
3,Diet Cookbook,"I did not particularly like this cookbook. While it was labeled Weight Watchers, it did not follow the points method, so I am not sure if it actually is a Weight Watchers book or if it is that old that the points system hadn't been invented yet. It outlined what it recommended you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, not just pages of recipes. Sorry, just not my type of cookbook."
4,Useful Menu/Cookbook,"This was useful to me in that it offered me simple ideas for Breakfast, Meal, snack etc. along with recipes.The only thing that I did not like was that it is an older version of WeightWatchers book and did not have the points for each menu but I was able to figure.This cookbook was more like an all in one book.But overall, I use this cookbook more that I use the newer Weightwatchers Cookbooks."
2,Nothing as bad since RUR,"The sets are minimal, the dialog is stilted and the acting is third rate.The plot is very predicable as well.This may be a new low even for a TV movie?Well I guess the 60's series lost in space may have been worse,but it was trying to be funny? These guys seem deadly seriousand come out like a ""Killer Tomatoes"" movie."
1,Seismic Isn't Even In The Index,Mathematics for Seismic Data Processing and Interpretation by Camina and JanacekThis is a very introductory text on digital signal processing. There is one highly simplified example inspired by seismic data in the last chapter. It could have been called mathematics for almost any signal processing purpose. Don't buy this book for information on seismic processing.
5,WOW!,This is an absolutely GREAT cd! How anyone can give it less than 5 stars is beyond me! And at under $5.00 for a new one it's a steal.
4,Enjoyable piano,"This is indeed the 'definitive' collection by British pianist Bobby Crush.Not something I would listen to on a regular basis, but works well in a mix of piano music/easy listening' etc."
2,Not as good a bargain as other Casio watches,"I own several other Casios and like them all. All have stainless steel cases and are solidly built. Although this is described as having a stainless steel case, it does not. It is a resin case with a stainless plate covering the top. The area around the buttons, the buttons themselves, and the area where the case meets the bracelet are all resin as well. Because it is resin, it is very thick and bulky. I would recommend other models of Casio, but do not recommend this. It feels and looks cheap. I opened the box, looked at it for 10 seconds, printed the labels and returned it."
1,Worked properly for 3 months,"I was very satisfied with this watch for about 3 months. But very soon the watch stopped to be radio controlled. I live in Boulder, Colorado which is very close to Fort Collins, from which the radio signal broadcasts. My attempt to perform manual receive also had no success, because the button A does not work. I tried to call customer service, but couldn't obtain any answer to my questions: they asked to hold and after few minutes of waiting disconnected."
2,atomically incorrect time,"Watch worked fine until we experienced daylight savings time.. now I can't get it to set the time correctly. Worse-- when manually trying to set my home time zone, my setting ( Eastern USA) doesn't even show on the list of options... so I am unable to adjust the watch. I must set it manually daily, hit the set/resume button and it immediately gains three minutes. Repeated emails to Casio go unanswered. I now have a watch that is one hour and three minutes off every day... so much for atomic settings of the time! Horrible manual too!"
5,"This Watch is ""on time""","This watch is perfect for a man who likes big watches. I love big watches. There is the necessity of familiarizing yourself with the users manual. I have never had a watch with so many instructions. It took me an hour to figure how to set it. However, I consider it time well spent. I have had it for only one month, but so far so good. I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Cheap plastic back,"I wanted an attractive, affordable atomic watch with a second hand and a metal band. This one meets those requirements, but for some reason the entire watch is not metal. The back of the watch is made of dark gray and black plastic. I fear that this watch will not be as durable as one that has a stainless steel back."
1,Very thick and ugly,"As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture. As mentioned by someone, it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. It also is very large and long. So to remove the small braces cost more. Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping."
5,Nice Looking,"The watch is nicer than I expected for a Casio watch. The dial is large and easy to read. The watch setup is a little confusing and cumbersome.Overall, a very good value."
4,I suspect it is not brand new,"The plastic coverage over the watchband is worn. But the watch looks new. I thought about return it, however it is a gift so I did not return because I did not have time to buy another one. The watch is too thick."
4,Good watch for the price,"It does have all the negatives of all the reviews. However, for $30 delivered from Amazon what do you expect? Although the face is bulky it is very light weight. This probably due to the back and lower sides are (black) plastic. I like that you don't have to set the time and date ever. Also, unless you take it off and do an inspection of the watch, it looks like a much higher priced watch on the wrist. Take it for what it is, a good looking watch with some great features for only $30."
3,Watch is a little too thick,"This watch does not work in the middle of the pacific, which I should have done some research before I bought.Anyway this watch is a little to thick and bulky for what it's size. I love casio watches because it's very reliable, but this one is a bit thick.The face and band is very well made and I especially like the silver tones. The watch looks good for what it costs. The quality is very good.If only it was much thinner, I wouldn't end up buying a new watch."
1,broken product,watch was received as a gift. It was received broken and the recipient was very disappointed.
1,Why is it priced so low?,"Daylight savings time in the US has changed. These watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules. While you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks, twice a year, it kind of defeats the whole purpose."
2,Difficult to Program,Bought this as a Christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped. Thought I could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature.However it is now January 18th and I still cannot program the watch.Frustrated
3,Funny Movie even if you're not a Mason fan,"One angry man is the fictional story of real life comedian Jackie Mason, who as he prepare's for his Broadway show, is summoned for jury duty. After repeated attempts to get excused, Mason is chosen to serve and that's where our story begins. This Funny, satirical look inside the deliberation room will have you laughing, but must importantly, you will connect with at least one of the 12 people in the room. From jews to Italiam mob wannabees,Cross dressers to gossip columnists, there is bound to be appeal for everyone. It's very difficult to stay involved in a film that primarily takes place in one room with nothing but dialogue, but ""One Angry Man"" manages to succeed. I only wish some of the characters had more to say. All in all, I think you will enjoy this laughfest starring one of the greatest comedians of our time...Jackie Mason's ""One Angry Man"" is a winner. Oye Vey!"
2,Does not work for BMWs,"Seems like a totally fine product (well constructed) BUT IT DOES NOT WORK FOR BMWs (even though the description says that it is for ""import"" vehicles). I have a 2005 325Ci and these screws are too thick."
4,"Nice scure fastners, length too long",These fasteners are well made and will provide secure solution to keep your license plate and frame away from would be thieves. My only issue with the bolts were they were too long and had to be cut to length.
2,Not sure what these fit.,"These don't fit my Toyota, BMW or Subaru... so I'm not entirely sure what ""import"" they fit.Anyway, they're stainless and appear to be made well.I'm quite confident they won't rust on the shelf in my garage."
1,"Cruiser Accessories 811330 Locking Fasteners, Import-Stainless","While searching for a Chrome License Plate, we were made to understand that the above needed to be ordered which was not the case."
4,Great product,"This is great for using with your vanity license plates. I highly recommend it. The star shape in the middle is easy to crack into though. All you have to do is spend 10 bucks at your local Lowe's or Home Depot. As long as your thief is lazy, you will be fine."
2,"They didn't fit my old Japanese car, I got screwed.","I have a 1999 Japanese car, I ordered this item for it, but it didn't work, they only screwed in about one quarter of the screw length or less. Therefore, I couldn't use them. Nonetheless, the screws et cetera seem to be of good quality and the price is good. I suggest that in the description you state that they ONLY fit foreign or Japanese cars from a certain model year to the present! I'm keeping them, as it would be too much of a hassle and expense to mail back this inexpensive kit. If and when I buy a new car, and if it happens to be a foreign car, perhaps I will then be able to use these screws. Time will tell, but for now, I'm screwed."
1,"Bad Fit, Stupid ""security"" lock","These do not fit any of my import vehicles (Volvo and Land Rover). They're too long and of incompatible threading.More irritating is the phony ""security"" aspect, which boils down to a special tool needed to use the bolts. A tiny tool that will almost certainly be lost. I am not a secret agent. Not in the CIA, NSA, MI5, or any other sort of high-espionage security. That means I don't need to worry about bad guys stealing my license plates. There's a pretty easy test to see if you should worry about someone stealing your license plates. You can take this at home. Two questions: 1) Am I the hapless bystander in a Jason Statham movie? 2) Am I James Bond? If the answer is ""no"" then you can relax. I worry a lot more about losing the ridiculous wrench needed to turn these screws than I do plate thieves."
5,Must have for a car you care about.,They seem to work perfectly well. I guess only time will tell if they truly are stainless. I paired these with the chrome screw covers and a chrome license plate holder and they all synergize quite nicely. These are a must have if you care for your car.
1,Non US,Fits only the larger Euro slots on a new BMW and not the US plate holes. The screws are too large for US.
2,Locking Fasteners,"Poor design, poor quality and poor instructions. Customer service didn't shine either. Live and learn. Next time I will spend a few extra bucks for better quality."
2,Rusty,"I've ordered two of these, there is a guarantee written on the package stating these are rust proof. Both of my orders clearly contained rusty nuts. I didn't even need to open the package to notice it. I'm going to use this item, simply because I don't feel like dealing with another return. I hope the screws don't begin to rust as well.Two stars, only because it's a very useful item."
2,Doesn't fit AUDI vehicles,I like this item but it DOES NOT fit neither 2007 Audi Q7 nor 2011 Audi A3 TDI! Good for IMPORTS? Well not GERMAN.
4,great funk,"just a purely great album of funk, and some of the best bass work you will ever hear.One star loss due to too much talking and filler between songs."
2,To Much Funk Not Enough Rock,"2 1/2 Stars = FairJust got done listening to,"" 'The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move... It's The Infectious Grooves,"" after several years of not listening to it, my opinion is pretty much the same, there are things I like about this album, but more I dislike. I'm a huge funk/rock & funk/metal fan, but this album is way to far overboard on the funk, it almost sounds forced, not natural & flowing as great funk should be. To much funk, can funk it up, & this album is, funked up as a whole."
3,Get infected.,"I'm not sure if one would call this a side-project, or supergroup, but it's a good listen. Members are from other bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, Metallica, and Jane's Addiction among others. To my ears, this basically sounds like a funkier version of Suicidal. I'd say it's a must listen for ST fans. Call it....funk-rock. It a bass slappin', drum poundin', yelling good time. Get it if you see it, as it's out of print at the moment."
5,It Really Works!,"I highly recommend this product to those suffering from the symptoms of hormonal imbalance. I noticed an improvement in libido and overall improved mood within less than 2 weeks of taking it! I take 1 cap in the morning and 1 at bedtime. For me, the results were very quick, and I felt an overall sense of wellbeing. Give it a try! It's safe, and you can use a dosage that works for you. Very impressed with the delivery and packaging! Thanks for a great product!!"
1,Side effects,"I do not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin or get headaches easily. I was taken the amount recommended on the bottle and it gave me a headache all day and insomnia. Also, I started to break out. If you do buy this I think you should start with one pill and see how your body react to maca."
5,Big Cat Diary: Cheetah,Love the book and the fast service. I love all of the books that Jonathan Scott has written. I just wish in the US that we could still see the Big Cat Diary Series.
5,I love this book.,I live in the United States and could not get dvd's of the program but this book takes me along each season and gives me insight to all of the big cats I have grown to love over the years. Well worth the money!
4,You may want to ask about the back cover of the book,"I love this show and I got the book for Christmas. The book was great but the front & back covers on both of the books we purchased were damaged. The one cover had a big cut mark on the page but the 2 back covers were mis-printed. It's as if the printer ran out of ink on both back covers.I uploaded 3 pictures from my purchase so you could see how bad they are. You may want to do more research or ask someone about the printing batch my book came from first before you purchase so you do not get the bad print job like I did. Don't get me wrong, I'm getting another book because I love this series but I will be purchasing from another site that's all.Love this series and the animals :)"
2,Interesting but deeply flawed,"Some rather fascinating information about the exchange of materials and ideas between Europe and the New World. However, the veracity of the data is corrupted by a rather crude but ubiquitous "" Native American-good, European--bad"" attitude. It is unfortunate, that the consistent political agenda makes this title difficult to accept as work of genuine scholarship. For instance, the author makes a claim that American Founders' ideas were based in their entirety(!) upon the Constitution of the Iroquois Nations, while discounting in its entirety(!) the influence Classical thought and Enlightenment has had upon the Founders. Indeed, the author claims that the ideas of Enlightenment were largely imported from the New World ( see Noble Savage). Verdict:a fun read, but highly suspect scholarship.Not recommended for impressionable readers incapable of critical analysis."
4,Looks to be alright,I haven't used it yet but it got to me on time and it looks to be just what I thought I oredered.
3,"hellraiser-ish soundtrack, that's just ok...","The music sounds like hellraiser's score.But the booklet is ultra cool! It's like a digipak holder but with multiple folds with director comentary and cool facts. plus 28 tracks!But overall I really never listen to it just because it's just not that good. And trust me I love soundtrack scores.The first 2 soundtracks were better, heck the were soundtracks and not scores."
1,Great for 6 months,My daughter is a bookworm and she got this for Christmas and loved tracking her time. The timer works but the sound stopped working so using the count down feature is now useless. Take your chances I guess.....
4,daughter loves to read with this,"Daughter is required to read 20 minutes every night and this item takes the pressure off me and her. No more ""Am I done yet"""
5,Great way to track reading minutes!,"My sons love this bookmark. We have been struggling with getting my youngest son to do his 20 minutes of reading every night. He constantly asks if he is done yet (starting after about 5 minutes). Since we got this bookmark about a month ago, he has not asked that question once and is not complaining about doing his reading as much either. It is very easy for him to reset the time each night and beeps when he is done. My older son also has one that he uses to track the minutes that he has read - only he does it the other way and keeps an ongoing record of how many minutes total it takes him to finish a book. He then writes down in his reading journal how many minutes the book took him to read (what a fun idea!). This bookmark does both ways of tracking minutes - counts down and counts up. Highly recommended!"
5,Timer is great,Product works great for school age timed daily readings. This is the second one that I purchased for my son.
2,Only Counts Seconds for First 59 Seconds,"If you're thinking about this as a tool to measure speed reading improvement, you'll be disappointed. After the first 59 seconds, it switches to whole minutes and does not show seconds, which makes it pretty worthless for completing speed reading exercises.It is also sealed in packaging that must be destroyed in order to open it, so you can't (at least I can't) return it in good conscience."
4,Helps me with reading time,Works really well.Is A little hard to activate but helps me keep track when I'm reading.I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep track of there reading.
4,"Good, not perfect","Love the idea of these bookmarks (we have two) and they're pretty great, but not perfect. I don't have the instructions (as I recall, they arrived, we tore into the packaging-- don't think we saved the paperwork), so it could be there's a solution to this that I don't know of. But the issue I have is that you can't tell that they're on unless you stare long enough to see the minute click over. It shows seconds for a while, but once you've read a certain amount, they're no longer there. Just a little indicator that showed it was counting would make a big difference. On such a simple concept, that makes the difference between 4 and 5 stars for me.Otherwise, we've used them for a couple of weeks now and so far, so good."
5,helps share reading time,"I have 5 year old twins and they each get to choose a book at story time. This has really helped split that time equally. It counts up, down, or shows the actual time. It is convenient by being kept with their books and a nice place holder for the next time."
2,How Hard Can it be?,"I needed a simple bookmark timer for my son. I spied this one, the price was right, and the reviews seems modestly favorable. First, you have to go through a mode switch to get to the count up, count down, or clock function. I just needed a count down and reset. Eventually, you can figure out which is which though I had to find instructions on their web site. For what should be a simple device, that's an automatic flag. Second, the reset is cumbersome and I have yet to get it to work right the first 2-3 times I've tried. I had to visit the web site again to find out how to reset. That's another strike against the bookmark. All in all, this bookmark missed the target by being too complicated and contrary."
4,Ingenious,Our daughter has required reading time for school and up to now we've been using the clock. She likes to get up in the morning and read and was having a hard time keeping track of how much time she spent reading. This lets her either count up how much time she has read or she can set a time and count down. This ensures she gets her required reading time. The bookmark also has a standard clock for learning to tell time and the operation is very simple. Press two buttons to reset the timer and an orange start/stop button. I would buy it again if presented with the situation.
3,"Works fine, but could be sturdier","I love the concept of this product, and works well when the go/stop button isn't getting stuck. Wish it was made just a little bit sturdier so that this would not happen."
4,Overall very good product,"These bookmarks are great. My daughter has 3 of them. I would give it 5 stars, but the purple one stopped working last week (we've only had it for a couple of months)"
2,Cheaply made,"I purchased this for my daughter, she has to read for specific time periods for school. The product came and it did not work. Product seemed cheaply made. The idea of this type of item is genius, but they need to make a better product."
4,What a great idea....!,"This was a great purchase for us as my grade school daughter needs to read each night and this helps her keep track of her time. You can either set it for the minutes you would like to read for or you can do an accumalation of time throughout a period of days/months. I would definately purhcase this item again and would even consider buying at as a gift. Seems very durable, would take a lot of effort to be able to break it."
2,Wild Midnight - Ann Major,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERTHE STROKE OF MIDNIGHTLacy Douglas's world was falling apart. Her life, and that of her child, was in danger, and she was forced to seek refuge with Johnny Midnight...the man who had taken her youthful innocence and given her a precious gift.The greatest challenge of Midnight's life lay in his reunion with Lacy. Once she'd betrayed him and made him what he was today--a man incapable of love. Now Lacy's pleas for protection ignited passions he'd long ago forgotten--while her son's eyes brought about startling revelations...."
2,Mechanism Doesn't Hold Up,"I've had two of these U-Locks, the locking mechanism is just poorly designed. The first one I traded in because the key broke off in the lock after the third time using it. The second one no longer opens after only 1 year of use, the mechanism just froze up. I'd recommend spending a little more to get something that will last."
1,DON'T BUY,"The key broke off in the keyhole upon first attempt at unlocking it, straight out of the package. THANK GOD I had not already locked up my bike."
1,Junk bracket,"I just got off the phone with customer service in Wisconsin. The plastic bracket broke because it is just too thin where the two mounting bolts attached. If you tighten to make it stay on the bike frame you end up snapping through the mount. So they advised I send everything back for a replacement. Huh? pay for shipping too? for a $15 heavy lock? And not a wise idea since I need the lock to secure my bike. How about you send me a new bracket and we try that? Nope, they won't do that! So I am going back to Target for a store credit. Very disappointed with this lock. I guess you do get what you pay for. Rating should be a 1/2 star."
2,The keys are TERRIBLE quality.,"If you have this product, don't pull too hard on the key when you're trying to get the lock open. It WILL break. It happened to me twice.The first time, the lock was jammed, I tried to force it open, and the key broke. I thought, okay, I was pulling too hard, and this was my fault. So, after the cops came and cut my lock, I stupidly bought the exact same brand of U-lock. The FIRST TIME I tried to open the new lock, what happens? The key breaks. Now, THAT was not my fault. At least, that time, the bike wasn't already locked to anything.Also, I've had to use WD-40 to get it open when it rusts in the rain. It was sometimes hard to open, even when it wasn't rusted. And I've never even bothered with the bracket, because it's very flimsy, just like the keys.It's a cheap lock, but you get what you pay for.But my first MasterLock lasted two years, so it might last a while if you're very careful."
1,not recommended,"I've had this lock for my new expensive bike for 3 months, and it was horrible from the start. I would go to unlock my bike, and on some occasions would leave it locked on the rack and walk (I live on a college campus) because it would be faster than spending more time trying to unlock it. There were some days that it would take me 10 minutes to lock or unlock. Every time it rained the metal inside would seem to rust and the new ware caused it to become even harder to use. Finally, today I went to lock up my bike, and the key just broke off in the lock. There is absolutely no way to get it out so my spare key was useless. Now I have an expensive bike on a rack outside at night because it happened after most stores closed, so I need to get a new lock hoping it my bike doesn't get stolen tonight, because the key broke in it before it locked. Horrible investment. Do not recommend getting this."
1,thanks for nothing masterlock...,Wow.. what a cheap product.. you would think masterlock would make a decent product... i have school in the morning and thought i'd check to see if my lock is working okay.. i used it maybe 4 or 5 times a year or so ago... the key almost broke off inside of this thing.. dont waste your money. i know i won't again..
1,fell apart within a week of purchase,"All I can say is I'm glad that the lock broke when my bike was NOT locked up with it and when I did not have to rush out to pick up my son from daycare.I bought this lock less than a week ago. I didn't even have time to install the bracket yet. The lock appeared to be working fine, but this morning when I went to lock up my bike at work, I stuck the key in and turned it, but wasn't able to unlock the lock. So I tried again and realized something was off. I looked at the key and in the key hold and realized THE TIP OF THE KEY HAD BROKEN OFF INTO THE KEY HOLE.This happened on a perfect, warm, spring day (i.e. not in the dead of winter when things crack all of the time) and with normal use.I bought this product from target, actually, and they only sold this brand so I didn't have the chance to check reviews, etc, or go with a more trusted brand such as kryptonite. Don't make my same mistake!"
1,Terrible,"Spend your money on something else.After a few weeks the lock will be nearly impossible to open. You will have to spray it down with some type of lubricant to get it to open. After that, it will always be hard to open.If you are in a rush, the weak keys will break on you.Don't buy it."
3,"Good, but not great","I have not read any of the author's works before, so perhaps that is why I don't feel more strongly about this book. It is the fourth of the series, and not having read the previous books made this one feel flat to me. Although the writing is decent and the characters interesting, the story never took off for me. It just sort of coasted at a low level without ever gaining any altitude. This is a fun read, but it is silly in places. Still, I liked it enough to finish it, and admit that I should have read the previous books before judging this one too harshly."
5,Smooth hip hop sound,"I love the song ""I Don't care"", The lyrics are so true to life. I think these young men will be rising up the ladder of success very fast, Look out Boyz To Men."
4,Straightforward,"This 29-page story, originally published in 1965, provides a straightforward accounting of the Passover story, most appropriate for non-Jewish children who want to understand the celebration.It explains the holiday that happens each spring, when Jewish people the world over celebrate their freedom from slavery with a Seder meal. Six pages are devoted to the Passover story itself--of how, more than 3,000 years ago, Egypt's ancient Pharaoh enslaved the Jewish, God brought ten plagues upon them and Moses led them forth to freedom and into the promised land.Several pages are also devoted to how Passover is celebrated today.The only weakness is that the text is dry. It doesn't convey the joy and spirit of this happy holiday.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,Excellent guidance for beginners and advanced yogis,"Asana Prnayama Mudra bandha provides detail clear instructions with explanation of beneifts and who should or should not do a particular asana. It is well organized, authentic and accurate. I simply love it. Great book for all levels."
1,Not one-handed,"I bought this, thinking that with the upright design, I could use it one-handed (handy in the classroom). Not the case. I have to hold the shavings container with one hand and the pencil with the other. If I do not, the shavings container comes just slightly open and the sharpener stops working. In general, I love Panasonic sharpeners, but will go back to the front-loading variety."
2,contrived and unbelievable at every turn,"Given the other glowing reviews, I must be missing something. Altough the book is nicely written, the story is so implausible as to be laughable. I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the premise - I like a good suspense story and they all require some of that - but it only got worse. The cops are unbelievable, the main characters friends, who all express concern about her, are uncaring stick figures, and her quest of the truth is not only silly, it comes down to her chasing the lead of someone looking to buy a cat -- no not in the obvious places you'd think to look like pet store, adoption center, ad... but by trailing gypsies who are rumored to have cats. I kept going thinking that in the end, there'd be a lovely twist that would make it all worthwhile. Not so. It peters out with an entirely predictable and everyday ending. I wanted to throw the stupid thing against the wall."
2,Not recommended,"HB/Fiction: This is the story of a woman who wakes up to find herself being held by a psycho who is into head games and torture. Our heroine escapes only to find that she can't remember where she was held or how she got in that situation to begin with. The book had so much potential, but comes up short. I spent a dollar on it and it was worth every penny. Not recommended."
1,Not new!,"I bought this book and in the description it said ""new""... It's in ""ok"" condition, but definitely looks like it has been used."
1,The narrator RUINS this story,"After slogging through 3 cassettes in the car, I have given up on this promising story....why? Because the narrator is SO TERRIBLY ANNOYING! I could barely concentrate on the story because of her voice and dramatizations. The story was just ""good"" for me, too. Can't believe all the fantastic reviews."
4,cold revenge,"I was riveted to this horrifying story of a young woman's abduction & incarceration by a man she never sees. When she finally escapes back to her life, she not only can't quite remember what she was doing before she was snatched, she is told, in no uncertain terms that not only can no one help her, no one really believes her.Abbie is not your usual damsel in distress, she's got ice in her veins & revenge on her mind.Nicci French has once again delivered a spine-tingling, hair-raising journey into the dark side of humanity.Scary, immediate & ultimately satisfying!"
4,Suspenseful with Good Twists and Turns,"This was a good read, but i found myself wanting to yell at the police, the doctors and most of all our heroine Abbie Devereaux. Even cops in the backwoods of the deep south will at least conduct some kind of investigation. and why wouldn't our hero tell her parents? her close friends? why was she wandering the shady streets of london alone? oh, becuz she was a loser who did something remarkable in the end. ok, i can dig that. the book was extremely suspenseful. i suspected all sorts of characters were the evil kidnapper, including good-guy Ben. i suspected that perhaps Abbie and Jo were the same people. the twists and turns kept you definitely on edge. and the fact that the story was based in london and used some definite UK terminology took me back. i'd recommend this book and i'd certain read another imaginative tale by nicci french. cheers!"
3,"This would have been a solid 4-star review, except...","This was my second Nicci French read, and I think the writers have developed tremendously since ""Killing me Softly."" Abbie's story is at once frustrating and frightening because the reader can easily imagine being in her situation. The aspects of the story I enjoyed the most were the obvious thought and strategy used in calculating time to escape from her captor. I also enjoyed what was not a ""neat and tidy"" ending.What irritated me about the story was the obligatory ""let's hop into bed with someone who may or may not be a suspect"" plot device. No author really uses this plot device effectively and I found that the constant referring to sexual encounters as ""f'ing"" implausible. Does anyone really think that a woman who had been abducted and psychologically tortured for any length of time would have the desire to ""f"" someone? This aspect of the plot really lowered my opinion of the book, although I will read Nicci French again."
5,Gripping,"Abbie Devereaux is taken hostage by a man who intends to kill her after he mentally tortures her. Abbie manages to escape from the man, but the police believe her story is fabricated. She has no recollection of how she was kidnapped, or who kidnapped her, nor does she remember the events leading up to her capture.This is a gripping tale, full of suspense and many twists and turns. Although the protagonist at times seemed too willing to rush headlong into danger without thinking of the consequences, this did not distract from this thrilling tale. The ending was a little unbelievable (her confrontation with the killer), but other than that, a great book.This is the first book I've read by Nicci French and one I really enjoyed."
3,es una clasica y gran pelicula,"En verdad es una bonita, dramatica, romantica y tierna historia que hubiera haber sido digitalizada y masterizada,por haber salido en DVD. desafortunadamente no fue asi, y no podia verse bien en una television de alta definicion. tuve que verla en una television convencional, con sonido mono y tratando de enfocar colores y matizes para lograr un mejor colorido.Espero que en el futuro todas estas peliculas,buenas puedan mejorarse con la nueva tecnologia y asi puedan verse como nuevas."
1,Item not received after a month of purchase,I have not received this item yet :( very disappointed . The order was placed on February and today still have not arrived
5,Just What I was Looking For!,"I wanted a clock radio that would play CD's. I've gone through several in the last 3 years...I'd figure out how to use them and then some part of it would break. The light adjustment on this unit is great - it really does light the room when set at full power. At the lowest power in does not disturb sleep. It was a little confusing to set up, but I called the 800 number and a very nice woman told me just how to do it. The sound is great! The only flaw, so far, is the buttons on the side are hard to read in dim light - actually in any light. I would recommend this product."
4,Good deal on CD/Radio/MP3 clock radio,"Relying on the Sony brand from previous experience prompted me to purchase this item when my old clock radio finally died, and I wasn't disappointed. It was easy to set up the time for my area and set both alarms (one to radio and one to CD), as well as adjust the settings.I like this clock's blue lighting vs the red light of my old digital alarm clock. It may be too bright even on the lowest setting for some people, but it doesn't bother me.The sound is very good given what the product is, a clock radio.It was so discounted a bit when I purchased it, but it's mainly due to my happiness with Sony products in general that persuaded me to get this one."
5,Very nice product,"Good sound, nicely and modern looking, work just fine (have like 6 month already), many nice features. So I recomend it!"
5,bedside alarm clock,This is my second clock radio to purchase in this line. It beats all the others hands down. Great illuminated face and nice quality sound and easy to use.
4,Great gift,"I bought this gizmo for my daughter's birthday. It was delivered promptly as promised and she loves it. The sound quality & overall performance of the unit is impressive especially for this price range. It is easy to operate & saves space, too. The only negative to me was the color, but it is more attractive than the picture. I would recommend this device."
1,Second Time CD Player Breaks...,"I purchased this CD Clock Radio because it had everything I needed- Radio, Clock, iPod connector and CD Player (and it looked very sleek). I purchased the first one and after a few days the CD stopped working (unfortunately I didn't have the receipt so I couldn't take it back to the store). Given the good reviews, I figured it was a fluke so I purchased another one because I couldn't find another model that had all components I needed and looked as good as this. Lo and behold 10 months after using the second clock radio the CD stopped working...I can't believe that's a coincidence."
3,Sony ICF-CD7000WC,"I bought 2 of these, one for myself and one as a gift. The gift CD player failed in less than 6 months and a refurbished unit was returned, with small defects. So far it has worked for about 9 months now. I don't use my CD player very much, so I cannot comment on durability over time for a good reference. The BRILLIANCE of the light output is overwhelming. How any of the others cannot state how bright the display is, well it leaves me astounded. I took the conservative side and figured the light couldn't be that bad; it is way! to bright, way to bright - let me repeat that - way too bright, even on the lowest setting... and I tend to be conservative in my opinions (I think). And I find the buttons to be hard to decifer in the dark."
4,satisfied,"I bought this for my daughters room after she was born and I have been pleased with it. The only thing I really wanted that this did not feature was repeat play---to replay the cd again. It just shuts off when it plays once through. I felt was pretty expensive for not having this feature, but overall happy with how it is working for my daughter to be put to sleep with music."
1,Will not fly,"Junk, It will not fly, tried for over 2hrs. It kept crashing into the ground. We called the company, they said it does that. Do yourself a favor and save a headache, do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not great so far.,The main issue is the controls. We are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types. It tends to just nose dive regardless. We will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash. That it's still in one piece is amazing.
1,Very disappointing toy,"We could not get this thing to fly more than 15 feet, were not able to get it to turn before it crashed and nose-dived. It eventually crashed and the nose snapped."
5,Great!,"I can't really add anything substantive; I just LOVE this CD. It's so nice to hear a new take on these very familiar songs. It's a great collection, lively, well-done and festive. Great for a holiday party or just as background for addressing Christmas cards. Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is a fantastic CD. I really liked their debut album ""no sleep demon"" and this CD won't disappoint. It is a little more mellow, but it still has those catchy hooks that you can't get out of your brain for days. Still, Avalost, from their first disc, is their best song but these collection of songs are still incredible."
4,Good but flawed,"i found this cd to be unique but at the same time dull... some of the songs just seemed like the have been done already. anyway i will give a quick review of each song..01. Tranformer 9/10((great opener, gives you the feeling that your at a ocean))02. Contact 8/1003. Soul Diver 7/1004. Digital 6/1005. Poisonous Friend 9/10((great song gives you the feelin that someone is stalking you))06. Separation 7/1007. Torch 8/1008. Go International 8/10((hate the lyrics but the song is extremely catchy somehow))09. Watching Over You 8/1010. Icarus 7/10((i love the beat, makes you feel like moving forward in life))all in all i would give this cd 7 out of 10 stars... while its definitley better then your average new EBM release.. its still flawed and boring at times. definite stand outs for me are Transformer & Poisonous Friend. only reccomended if your a big fan of the genre."
3,"Can be mellow at times, but holds it's own","Beyond Flatline is Seabound's sophomore release, and is a blend of pure electronic music, clear vocals, and danceable beats. Of the ten tracks on the album, the only songs which really stand out are the high bpm songs...Transformer, Contact, Poisonous Friend, and Go International. The rest are of the slower, quieter type of synthpop that isn't all that stimulating. As a result, I was somewhat disappointed with it since I favor a more high energy pace. Despite my gripes, fans of Covenant, Devision, and Wolfshiem should definitely look into this album. It's a great start for the band, and there's at least enough to warrant a listen for anyone into electronic music."
3,"7"" Grinding Disks Abrasives",Well packed set of 5 disks. Great for paint removal or woodworking. Not so good for grinding metal. Grit falls off too fast.
