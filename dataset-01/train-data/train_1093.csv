3,Another excellent Duran Duran cd,"Like this cd for one reason only and only giving it three stars,...I onlylike one track on this disc and that is on disc no.1; the seven minute long version of ""Planet Earth(Night Version)"" on the very first track. Ilike that really long intro alot,...it is great to listen to as is the whole song, but that real long into is what makes the song so great in my opinion. If only they could have made ""Hungry Like The Wolf(Night Version)""just as long,even that song would be even better as well."
5,"Wonderful,,,,,","This is truly for any Duran fan, all of the remixes are super great, it's a great dance CD this one cost a little more but is worth every red cent, you will love it!!!!!!!"
5,some advice...,"After noticing the price and the time it takes to ship this import cd (2 to 5 weeks!), I got to thinking about the ""import"" aspect...obviously, it's imported from the UK...and hey--doesn't Amazon have a UK site? Indeed they do. This CD can be had for around 7 pounds, with shipping at about 6 pounds (sorry, I don't remember the exact figure). Plus, there wasn't the big hold-up on shipping it. I got it in about a week. I also ordered a Sting import (also about half the price that I would have paid for it from Amazon.com, and with tracks on it that the American version doesn't have). I don't know if I'll get in trouble from Amazon for pointing this out, but if you're going to get this, it's a far better deal to get it from the Amazon.co.uk site. Even with the exchange rate. Just some advice.And the CD? It's wonderful."
1,"okay content, bad service from publisher BUYER BEWARE","I originally ordered Mailbox News from this publisher only to find out that they were cancelling that publication. Instead they offered me this magazine. I wanted my money back. After six months of promises, but no action I finally said okay just send me this magazine (better to read something about cake decorating than getting nothing). Then it took more than 6 more months to get my first issue. One full year after my original submit I finally got a magazine. Then, because this magazine cost slightly more than the Mailbox News that I wanted, I won't get as many issues as I subscribed for. Rumor has it, in the cake decorating circles, that even this publication is about to go under. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
1,subscription terrible,I have been a subscriber for three years and every year after renewal I have to call and try to get my subscription restarted. This year they have informed me there are no more issues left for Oct/Nov/Dec and I was to go looking in retail store for if I wanted it. Not at all the way to treat a customer.
3,wanted more,"This is a good magazine for standard cake decorating - I was hoping for more ""out of the box"" ideas."
2,"Same song, different verse",It seems I should have read the reviews before ordering. I ordered this at the beginning of July for my wife's birthday. She did not receive the Aug/Sep issue because they said it was already ready to send when I ordered. Then I called again and was told that she would receive it November 21st. Called today (12/1) and they of course don't understand why she didn't get it. But there are no more of the magazines left and all they can do is extend the order. Supposedly the middle of this month they will send out a new issue. Guess we will wait and see...
3,Long wait,"The magazine is nice. There were some nice cakes, however it took months to get my first issue & I'm still waiting to see if I'll get a second issue. Not sure yet if its really worth the money. I've certaintly got more out of cake decorating books that cost less, but time will tell."
1,american cake decorating magazine,"I still have not received this magazine. I placed my order back in June. I have never before had problems with an item being delivered, even from the most obscure vendor!"
1,Have yet to recieve this magazine.,"I received a music sheet book instead of the American Cake Decorator Magazine I ordered. I haven't had a chance to send the sheet book back, hope to have some time to do so this weekend-what an inconvenience! Very displeased!"
3,Not as good as I thought,Good album but just not filled with any music that I would enjoy hearing again.
4,"Decent, not for high traffic areas","Very good value & the design is attractive (matches the picture). We have them in a high traffic hallway at our company and they had to be replaced within a year due to bent/broken slats. The good news is that we returned to buy them again, so its more our issue than the product - but just know they won't withstand a lot of weight/pressure on them."
5,A Definite Must Have!!!,"This books is totaly awesome - definitely a must have for every library collection!! Even if you aren't a poetry lover, When Paper Met Pen will transcend your imagination!! I give it 5 stars!!"
4,Fabulous. Love this author!,"This guy is fabulous. So funny. I've never laughed out loud while reading a book before; until now, that is. Please, Mr. Handler, write, write, write!!!!!"
4,A fun read - close to perfection,"I love all of David Handler's books. . . the Hoagy series, especially. This book is as enjoyable as all of the others in the series. It's a little less suspenseful - you can pretty much figure out the murderer early on - but the twists and turns keep you on an interestingly winding trail to the conclusion. I recommend this and every other David Handler book out there. I wish he'd write MORE MORE MORE!"
1,I tried to make myself read it and I just couldn't do it!,I wanted to like this book. I found it rambling and the anaysis superficial.
1,Don't waste your time with this book,Anyone can clip selected newspaper and magazine articles from which to extrapolate a preconceived view of the future based upon one's own political philosophy and fantasy. This book is a waste of money and a big waste of time. I forced myself to read it through to the merciful end.
1,Boring!,"I am a seventh grader and for my anual quarter book I had to read Trends 2000. My assignment was to read only four chapters of the book, in any area that I choose.But even four chapters of the book was very dull and I do not recomend anyone to read this book."
2,"OK, but have your opinion filter on!","At times the subject is presented in an odd way; like the author's looking back as if 2000 was already here. Some good insights- I especially liked the coverage of new trends in organic farming and homeschooling. Some of what he says is baseless, however. He hammers the government and press, but then references their reports and articals when it fits his mindset. What perturbs me the most is his anti-nuc (nuclear) position. It appears throughout the book, in unrelated topics, and is mostly unsubstantiated. He repeatadly says ""radiation levels are rising"", which, of course, is not happening. Also, his cut and paste of news paper articals are weak- he treats them as research. Overall the book is OK if you have the ability to filter out the unfounded opinions."
1,Not Worth It,Don't waste your money. The on/off knob came off the first time I turn it on and razors are not sharp enough.
3,Lacks energy,"I'd give most Toots and the Maytals' work 5 stars, but to me ska has to have a raw garage/beerhall sound and energy to it. This album is done with modern studio technology, unlike much of the original '60s-'70s ska recordings. To me this doesn't suit the genre; the result is a certain flatness. If you haven't got them yet, pick up the Anthology or the Very Best Of and you can't miss.Forget about this one. It's okay, but not up to Toots and the Maytals' usual standards."
1,great for older child 10 +,It was beautiful but it made of porclein and very delicate an older child will really love it since they will hold it and put it back on it's stand but for a younger child can prove to be challenging since they want to move it around and it much to fragile for that as a lover of the muppets what detail and how beautiful it was just sorry I could not keep such an airloom since she would want to play with it and may even climb if I try to put it on a shelf Niki is one of the best humans I have done buisness with she is understanding and generous and a delight plus she has plenty to choice from and your package arrive with caring making you feel special
3,Carrying on the tradition.,"This should be a satisfying film for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed the historical Carry on's such as ""Don't Lose Your Head"". There is more smut than in earlier entries, but this 1974 film contains the last Carry On performances of Sid James (brilliant as ""Reverend Flasher""), Hattie Jaques and Barbara Windsor and should be seen for them. There is admirable attention to creating the story's period and plenty of blue humour."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,"One Circus, Three Rings, Forever And Ever is a poem by Joseph Pintauro, illustrated by Corita Kent. It is so New York and Central Park. It is so 1960s and early 70s. A feast for the mind and heart. It makes my spirit soar."
1,I'm only giving this ONE star because......,".....Bocelli doesn't do dance remixes, which REALLY pisses me off!"
5,thanks giving tradition,"this movie is one our family watch while cooking on thanks giving. it has been a tradition in our family for years. When we moved we lost it. Thanks to you, you shipped it in time for Thanks giving and our tradition continues."
4,Christmas in Connecticut,"The movie was as described by seller. It is a cute Christmas movie. Dianeand Kris did a good job of the story. If a person likes light Christmas movies,this would make a nice addition."
4,Christmas in Connecticut,Even though this movie has a predictable plot I enjoy it every holiday season. Like cast of characters and stars who play them. Makes me appreciate the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.
5,Christmas in Connecticut,"I `ve seen the movie a very long time ago and since then it was in my mind, but I forgot a title. Well, it took that long to look up for this movie and it was great New Years Eve gift for myself to watch it.I am thankful for the quick service. I love all about Christmas and being with a family, this movie is great to share with friends and family.Thank you.Andrew D."
1,ARE YOU ON CRACK?!!,"This movie is baaaaad. Not bad meaning good, but amazingly, awkwardly, laughably bad.Bad story, bad sets, bad dialogue, bad acting, bad directing.I am not being mean or angry here, just want to save you. Take the life preserver I offer you, friends. Avoid!Previous positive comments which are true: family-appropriate; Dyan Cannon is cute and fun; probably something else, not sure."
2,Just okay,"I'm sorry but I like the old Christmas in Connecticut so much better.There was just something missing in doing this over. Barbara, Dennis and""Cuddles"" had chemistry. I collect Christmas movies and this is just okay. Sorry."
5,Review,A great Christmas flick! A film on par with It's a Wonderful Life. I just love Judy Forrester as Billy's mother. What a babe! She and Kris Kristofferson made the movie a hit.
1,BAD,"This movie was recommended by a reliable source but I truly doubt it was this specific version. It suffers in so many ways including bad acting, poor story line, etc., that it is hard to find anything good to say. If it were possible I would return it and get my money back."
1,This is awful,"Christmas movies are a guilty pleasure and I will never admit the exact number in my libary, but this DVD went to The Salvation Army after only one viewing. I love cheesey movies but I found this one painful to watch. There is quite a bit of over-acting and it pales in comparison to the original. I think there is a reason that its not shown on TV any more. Skip this movie and buy something better."
1,REMAKES NEVER MATCH UP TO THE ORIGINAL,This horrible and needless remake should find its way into the bargain bins of DVD stores and used media stores. It in no way matches up to the 1945 Barbara Stanwyck classic which will soon be released on video. Forget this and pick up the original! You won't be disappointed. This remake is inferior!
1,SEE THE ORIGINAL!,Don't bother with this remake. See the original with Barbara Stanwyck. This is just a very pale imitation.
1,Awful,"This product is terrible. The instruction manual is oversimplified and tells you everything you have to know except what to do if the product doesn't work, witch it won't. Mine refuses to accept that it is physically connected to the cable connection and so I get television snow like you would expect to see from a tv with rabbit ears. Further the only way that you can get stations set is by fiddling with the connection one increment at a time in options, but there is no way to save your adjustments, so that once you have a signal, each time you change channels you lose that signal. It is disappointing. I wanted a fun simple tv tuner and instead all I have is a box of junk that can't even find or recognize the cable signal from my coax cable. Don't bother."
1,Doesn't fit new WD hard drives.,"Tho the cable is recommended by Western Digital's online manual to provide a more secure connection than the usual SATA data and and power cables, my new Western Digital Caviar GP 500 drive is missing the required legacy ATA power receptacle -- there is just a hole where I assume it used to be on older drives. So the cable is useless. A regular latch-type SATA data cable works fine anyway along with a SATA power cable from the power supply, and is secure enough."
2,Carborite Crispy Caramel Bar,These are good tasting but unfortunately contain partially hydrogenated soybean oil so I would stay away from them until it is removed.
1,Literary Nonsense,"I had to read this mess for an MFA class. Set aside that it is feminist crap, the book is written entirely in the second person --- if I hear one more 'you did such and such' I'll puke. It's a slog fest not worth the paper its written on. The lesson I learned? Most of what passes for ""literary"" is just mediocre writing by people who are friends with other mediocre writers, and consider making their work unintelligible a form of creativity. They call it ""experimental""."
1,"lot's of pages, not much good advice","This is about as simple as it gets. You can sum up 95% of the book with ""Relax when you swing, and make your real swing more like your practice swing."" May be breaking news to some...I didn't see much that can help the average to good golfer here."
1,I can't believe they still print this,"I read this book when I was about ten years old . It belonged to my older sister. The case studies are like inspiration to starve yourself. I think this book really can mess with a little girl's mind- it gives a vibe of ""oh, how terrible it is that these girls have an eating disorder"" with an undertone of ""but that girl with an eating disorder got to wear a size 8!""Not to mention that the nutritional information is horribly outdated. Please don't do this to your kid. Skip the book."
4,"a valuable, easy to read introduction to Gettysburg","This book is a very good introduction to those who want to learn a little about the battle of gettysburg. Written in an easy to read style,it covers just enough detail to whet your appetite for more, or give you confidence to talk a little on the subject: there are 20 or so short digressions intersersed throughout the text which provide a little more biographical detail on key participants, or information about notable incidents. Recommended ."
5,Good overview of the campaign,"A good overview of the Gettysburg campaign, from the aftermath of Chancellorsville to Lee's retreat back into Virginia. I thought a little more emphasis could have been spent on the 20th Maine under Col. Joshua Chamberlain, and how the addition of the 120 mutineers from the 2nd Maine to its roster helped give it the extra men it needed to hold onto Little Round Top."
5,Just as I expected,This LENOX casserole was well packaged.It arrived with no breaks or chips or anything wrong.I wanted this last year.......and was able to still findthis item at a REASONABLE PRICE thru Amazon....Decor & More wasthe storefront.
5,Great Service,These folks had the best price that I could find. Once I placed my order I got the bags quickly.
1,easily comes apart,This toy comes apart very quickly. It's just a toy to look at. The parts are very small and this toy is way overpriced for the quality.
1,Not Good for Someone Who Actually Wants to Play With It!,"This is a horrible toy that keeps breaking. This is the first day that we've had it and it is an 11 year old who bought it, not a little child who is rough on their toys. My Son is so upset that he actually bought this with his own money and it is made SOOOO poorly."
1,Very Disappointing,My son got this figure for Christmas and was very disappointed in it. It is extremely small for a high price and whenever he tries to play with it parts fall off. I will not buy from this company again.
4,A great relief to find this book,"I am a caregiver to my 90yr old blind mother who suffers from vascular dementia as well. This book was written by other caregivers with information , questions and answers that can only be appreciated by those who care with someone with this type of illness. The book covers many types of dementia, whether it be Alzheimers, vascular or others. What is really important is that the book encourages the caregiver to take care of themselves if they are to be able to take care of their patient."
4,"Dramatic, slightly repetitious, overall entertaining","Being a particularly large fan of all things off-road, particularly Baja related, this was a pretty exciting documentary for me. As documentaries go, this one definitely stands to be more entertaining than average. The sad truth is anyone not interested in the subject matter will find this relatively boring if they can get over Dana Brown's excessive use of the word ""synonymous""At times this documentary can be slightly discontinuous, but overall I think Brown does a decent job of really capturing the spirit of the 1000 which is undoubtedly uplifting."
4,great dirt movie,"I got tired of my kids renting so we bought it. Great movie fun to watch,family friendly"
4,Excellent movie!,"This documentary on the Baja 1000 desert race is amazing. Great helmet cam, in-car, and helicopter footage. I thought after reading about Baja for 20+ years that I knew what this race was about, but NOW I feel like I've been there. You don't have to be a ""gearhead"" to enjoy this movie."
1,The Sound Designers are IDIOTS!!!!! -5 Stars!!!!!!,"Come on Hollywood, this movie ""COULD HAVE"" ROCKED!!!Sound design IS such an integral part of making a movie. For example, the sound design of ""Master and Commander"" (A 5 Star movie, BTW!!! Get the ""Collector's Edition!"") is so impecable that they used REAL Civil War artillery to get the sounds of the cannon fire ""correct"" and ""true to life."" They also fired LIVE ROUNDS at wood pallets, to get the true to life ""splinter sounds.""How can a modern day movie maker be soooooooo STUPID to ""dub"" the engine sound of a TWO STROKE dirt bike in the place of a FOUR STROKE Honda XR650R?!?!? Maybe possibly because a racing two stroke engine actually ""sounds better?"" That is NO EXCUSE!!! I'm sorry, wait NO I'M NOT. This movie dropped the bomb over the HIGHEST CLIFF ON THE PLANET. So much potential.....This is so UNBELIEVABLY SAD!!!!!"
3,DUST TO GLORY! and Glory it was!!!,"I must say when my husband asked me to watch this DVD, I agreed only out of minimal interest. I have been to San Felipe several times and have been there on Race Day for the BAJA 250. Although I have enjoyed being there in person, I did not think I would like to watch a whole DVD on the subject. Boy was I mistaken.Watching this DVD was like taking my first buggy ride! I smiled the entire way through (but no sand in my teeth :) It was very interesting and fast paced. I am now much more of a fan of this sport and cannot wait to go down to BAJA again to watch and be a part of this wonderful race.I HIGHLY recommend buying this DVD and watching over and over. Our 12 year old son loved it as well!!!!!!!"
5,Dust to Glory,"Excelent quality DVD. Short in extras. A little too much interviews and from the same group of people. Need to interview some not so famous participants also. Few action scenes. But overall, a good film that can give to a non initiated a good overview of the sport. Luckily not being focused in the dangers of the race. I like it and reccomend."
5,Great birthday present,"Dust to Glory was just what my husband wanted. It's something he's been searching for. Great condition, too. Thanks a lot!"
1,Garmin GTM 20 FM- Band Traffic Receiver,This product is a total waste of money. It provides 5% of the information the discontinued MSN receiver offered. Garmin has missed the boat big time on this product. I will attempt to get my money back.
1,Don't purchase if you are on the outskirts of town!,"I live in a town that is listed on Clear channels web page as well as in the coverage area of the FM reception. However, in the past few days that I have had this, I have seen 1/2 dozen accidents some as old as five hours that closed the freeway down and none of them showed up on my Garmin. I have contacted Garmin about this and they did not know what to say, except that they will send an email to Clear Channel. I would suggest staying away from this or any other FM traffic at this point. It looks as if this is a ""work in progress.""I would really like to find a system that will actually work in the Los Angeles / Ventura County area. The MSN receiver that came with my unit (NUVI 780) received traffic, but none of the other features. Way too expensive of a service for just traffic. I am not sure if Garmins free service is any better, since they all seem to get their data from one company."
1,Broke in first week,"Terrible product execution on the GTM 20...the part that inserts into the cigarette lighter broke apart the third day I used it with my Nuvi 760...the replacement cost is ridiculous...and I am now seeing a number of online reviews about the GTM 20 breaking easily...If I had the decision to make again, I'd probably skip Garmin altogether and buy another brand."
2,Sounds like the tip issue is common,"I've been using mine (included with my Garmin - I know I wouldn't have paid $200 for it) for a little over a year. Recently I went to plug it in and noticed the tip missing. My concern was whether it was lodged in the cigarette lighter. Fortunately, it wasn't. I was about to throw the whole thing out, but went looking for a replacement fuse setup just in case. For a replacement cost of $200 for the unit, I'll keep looking for the part. Didn't even miss the traffic updates though - where I drive, it never did much."
4,I Agree with the Software Advocate,"An addition to my previous review. I contacted Garmin for a replacement, which they promptly sent me. the replacement seems to be working much better, so hats off to Garmin for correcting the problemThe new replacement part seems to be functioning very well.I had exactly the same experience as the software advocate described above. Unfortunately, since this is also the power adapter, it temporarily (until you purchase a new power cord) renders the GPS unit useless."
3,Marginal,"I bought a nuvi 660. Lucky it came with the Garmin GTM 20 FM-Band Traffic Receiver, because they are out of their minds to charge what they do for one...( Totally Ridiculous)! I will not buy or replace the one I have if it breaks; not for that price. Now,if you do not live in a major US city do not buy this item. It does not have coverage in any areas outside of some major US cities. The coverage within the cities are ok and fairly accurate. One needs to keep in prospective what kind of device it is and don't expect perfection, because you will not get it in this device or any other device of this nature. Over all, this device does work reasonably well and can be helpful."
2,Cheaply Made Adapter,"I see from the reviews that my adapter isn't the only one that broke while trying to remove it from the plug in my car. My cheap phone charger is made to last a lot longer than Garmin's cheap charger. I can't use my Garmin now, not sure I want to buy another GTM 20 or try something else."
2,Fell Apart,"After less than a year of use, it fell apart and part was stuck in my cigarette lighter/ plug."
4,"Used one for over a year, Love it!","I have used this product in the seattle area for over a year. It works, it has taken me on routes I didn't even know existed (after living here for 25 years) , and routes I knew but never thought to use them in the way the traffic router does. It is invaluable to me. It does pick the best route based on the traffic information without having to touch the yellow diamond, that is only when something comes up in route you can choose to avoid or not. It will ask me verbally that there is a better route available do I want to choose it? I am shocked at the replacement price for the GTM 20, mine is fraying at the plug to the unit not the lighter end. Amazon price is better than Garmin's but I just don't think I can live without it. I will have to save my beans to replace it. It gives me peace of mind commuting to work everyday!."
3,Broke in 3 days! But it was useful...,"My job gave me a Garmin Nuvi 660 and GTM 20. I got it on a Monday, by Thursday, the GTM 20 piece that touches the cigar lighter was lodged in there, and of course, the unit did not work. I am expecting a replacement from work; hopefully it will be better. It is possible that I received the 1 out of 1,000,000 that won't work correctly, but I'm putting this review here so if anyone else has a similar problem, we can all know about it. The traffic information was very useful when the product did work!"
1,Can't find info connecting to Nuvi 760.,Item came with Nuvi 760 GPS... No apparent way to connect together.Adapter needed?Garmin website no help...
1,save your money,"I used this for about 2 weeks in the NYC area in December 07. The reports were totally worthless, I was told there was heavy traffic ahead when there was none and not told of traffic and ran into jams without warning. 2 times it reported jams when I ran into them and it was too late. Save your money do not buy any traffic receivers, the technology is too early in development. I wouldn't use it if it was free considering my experience and would rate it ""0"" Stars if possible. the GPS is great with the NUVI 650 though."
2,Broke in a weeks' use,"This came with a Garmin 760 that I purchased last week and already this thing fell apart on me. I picked it up to plug into my cigarette lighter and the plastic ring, connector and fuse just popped off. It was probably already loose from plugging/unplugging it less than 10 times, but it broke so easily that I checked online to see if it was a prevalent problem. 9 reviews so far on Amazon but already 3 people have reported the receiver getting stuck or broken. For the price you pay for this it should last longer than that. I'm contacting Garmin customer service for a replacement and will hopefully update with a positive resolution from Garmin."
2,Traffic Band Receiver,Great product but flimsy and expensive. The reason I bought a replacement was the orginal one broke within a year. The portion that plugs into the socket became weak and fell apart. I really like my GPS with the traffic alerts so I broke down and was willing to give it another try.
5,Birds Eye Views On the Windows of One,"The characters are interesting and the symbolism of exchange is phenominal, in this moving picture. I godda, by it, Rox"
1,as bleak as the terrain,"There's a problem with earnest and well-meaning films. They're earnest and well-meaning. This film could use a light saber or two. (Or a magic wand, Alan.)"
3,A Winter Bust?,This looked promising but the sound was not the best and with no sub-titles its hopeless for the hard of hearing. I wonder what it was about??
1,One lousy movie,"Emma Thompson is a favorite actress of mine, and I expected to like this movie. I was disappointed that it seemed to lack plot. The only redeeming feature was the scenery which was lovely in a stark way. I would not recommend the movie."
1,Stunningly boring,"Stunningly boring and predictable, I was very disappointed, kept waiting for resolution not a film I would recommend unless you needed a sleep aid"
1,Dreadfully Dull Movie,"Oh my, after reading all the reviews here, I was sure this movie would be a winner regardless of the handful of low ratings. You see, I enjoy plots that slowly develop the characters and then weave them into the story line such as ""Out of Africa"", or ""A Room with a View."" But watching the ""The Winter Guest"" was a grueling test of patience. I cannot comment on the story line because I turned off the DVD after the first half hour. Dismal at best!"
2,Looked good,"Having lived for 4 years in a Scottish coastal town and experienced its weather there is no way that people could look so serene when outdoors in winter. Where was the biting wind? The chilblains? The runny noses? Why was no one wearing gloves?Most bizarre.The sea looked good however, and if you like slow-paced plays on the screen, then you'll enjoy it."
2,Very mediocre viewing! I gave up! Not worth the cost to find that out.,"Course language aside the English dialogue/ brogue makes it difficult to understand. Don't understand why the BBC and like producers don't take the effort to us subtitles/ script so we can follow the plot. Even ""Downtown Abbey"" and like dialogue could vastly improve the understanding and general appeal of the performances."
5,Watch this film,"Are you a woman? a wife? widow? divorced? mother? girlfriend? even teenager grown into adulthood now...Exception piece of work here, character studies and superb performances by Mother and Dauther actresses.You will cry and laugh and maybe stop to think about your own life in a different way. The location and film work by the camera crew is stunning just in itself. Watch the special features and appreciate this even more"
1,Not very memorable,"I found the characters annoying, especially the bickering mother and daughter, and the two foul-mouthed school-skipping boys. The plot....well there just wasn't much of one. I'm not sure how the four plot threads were supposed to fit together. Not one of Emma Thompson's more memorable performances. As for the allegedly starkly beautiful Scottish coast, to me it was just stark. Subtitles would have been useful; I missed a good part of the dialogue because of the heavy accents. Judging by the ratings here, many folks loved this movie. I was simply underwhelmed."
4,Not their best album,I bought this album thinking their were going to be some un heard of rare tracks. There were a couple I think. But if you want a slipknot album get their original one. Buy this only if you are a die hard fan like me.
4,Talented and Rocking,Enjoyed this CD a lot...just wish they'd let themselves go a bit more...really knock off some solos ann dbass licks! There's talent in this band waiting let rip. Can't wait for the next CD.
4,"Well, I wouldn't call it GREAT sound exactly . . .","These aren't bad computer speakers. They're solid and well made with bright, clear tweeters (from mb-quart) and a powerful subwoofer. They also look great.Their weak point is the midrange, where most music actually is reproduced. The two-inch mid doesn't do a bad job, but it definitely seems edgy and distorted compared with my other computer speakers (from monsoon, a/d/s/, and nakamichi). Vocals suffer especially, with a fatiguing, unnatural edge to every sibilant. But you could make the case that none of my other three pairs of computer speakers is currently available, so maybe this is the best sounding pair of computer speakers you can buy this side of eBay."
5,Grand Full Sounding system,"Excelent speakers and great wall shaking subwoofer. The cables that come with it are not the best, but they work and I use them, but I would like a better cable tho. but there not bad enough for me to go out and buy some better ones. one thing i noticed was that when you plug in the aux in and the line in at the same time as if you would if you use them with your TV and DVD player along with the line in on a computer the volume is alot lower. whe you unplug the line in the sound from the aux in gets louder."
5,Surround Sound!,"These are killer! The first time I plugged them in, I was trying to figure out if it was my laptop playing the music - because I thought the sound was coming directly from infront!Great desk-control - I love being able to plug my headphones in from the front without reaching behind the machine. It also has a great dial for both the subwoofer + the volume control.Worth every penny!"
4,Best PC speakers I've owned,"I bought these to replace a pair of Yamaha speakers with a Kenwood amp. They sound great. Bass hits hard, vibrates the walls. Nice clear mids and highs from the satellites. I would definitely buy these again."
2,Constant hiss from amplifier to satelites,Very high quality sound BUT the constant unstoppable hissing that feeds from the speakers when not in use is off the charts. The only way to stop it is to get down to the base bin and kill the main power switch on there. I would NOT buy these again. Returned for refund quickly. For that price range they need to be much closer to perfect.
3,Better second try,"First set did not work, even smelled like smoke. Amazon sent second set right away and they rock."
2,Good at the start...bad long term,"Yes...these speakers are pretty good. But after about 5 months of use, this system has failed to impress me. First, I didn't notice the hiss, but out of nowhere there is a loud popping noise every now and then. A VERY loud popping! Second, my subwoofer is sub-par now. At certain bass levels, the bass pops which is distracting and disappointing. Apparently the subwoofer couldn't handle it a lot of bass. Overall if you want to get a sound system for a cheap price, get these. Just don't play your music on it very loud."
3,Not that Great,"The GMX A-2.1 may look good, but with the pricetag I'd say look for a better sounding set. Yes it looks cool and all put it simply can't output the great sound that others sets can at the same price. It had decent quality when I tested, but when listening the sub seemed a bit out of place with the rest of the system. Maybe it was just the positioning of the sub, but I didn't like it. Highs are there, but the midrange is a bit lacking. It also lacks the power to ""punch""For the same amount you can get the Klipsch Promedia 2.1's, definately suggested instead of these."
1,If you don't mind the subwoofer cutting out...go for it :(,"I owned the older version of these speakers and loved them. I purchased these thinking that they were merely asthetically updated. To my suprise, as soon as I hooked them up and plugged in my ipod there was no bass. The subwoofer was not responding whatsoever. There was a short circuit in the control box. Upon tapping on the housing the bass would come on...this did not scream quality. In fact, each time I would turn the speakers on, I would have to fiddle with the control module. Thankfully amazon gave me a refund, I guess I'll buy another set of the old ones."
3,They are for sale at 1/2 of what I paid!,"They are good, but they are an overkill for a laptop, which is what I wanted them for, and Dell's speaker system, the bass is much smaller, but seems to sound better; same thing with the speakers, high tech as they might be, their design does not convince me at all (remember, this are the comments of a 53 y/old 1/2 bold guy, newer, younger generations will probably love them."
1,Unclear map,"I bought this map book with the intension of using it as a road map while driving when necessary. The contrast is bad and the maps unclear. Maybe I did not understand what they were for... I use maps alot and have never come across one where finding roads is difficult, until now."
2,It's Not Maine,"As a native Mainer and longtime owner of the Maine Atlas and Gazeteer from DeLorme's, I had high expectations of the Maryland one. And I really had a need for it too - I commute there for business about 40 weeks a year.I am very disappointed by this product. It has nowhere near the detail or resolution that the original Maine one does. (I think every dirt road in the State of Maine is clearly marked!)I shudder to think about what the Gazeteer would be for a state like CA or AK ... somebody else will have to find out!"
1,$5 Worth of Info with a $60 Tag,"Okay, so maybe I fell for the ""Price it high, and they will come"" pitch. This book is very elemental and basically states: 1. Use Microsoft Project to manage development projects 2. Resource allocation is the most critical facet of development (ah, yeah) 3. Speed to Profit is more important that Speed to Market.Okay, there, I just saved you the $60 I wasted."
5,SOOOOO Special,"Even though my children are 9 and 13 now, they still remember how this book spoke to my 13-year-old when her younger brother was born. Anna Grossnickle Hines captures the gentle wonderment and protectiveness that so many children initially feel toward ""their"" new babies. Sure, later on, there may well be rivalry, resentment, feeling less unique, etc., etc. (and there are plenty of books around that attempt to deal with this). But, I am so grateful that the author has so simply, respectfully, and eloquently recorded the essence of that very special relationship between two siblings, as it is born."
5,NEK ES UN GRANDE Y SU MUSICA ES EXCELENTE,"LA MUSICA Y EL ESTILO DE NEK ME PARECEN EXCLENTES, POR ESO ADQUIRÍ SUS DISCOS, AUNQUE EN MI PAIS NO SE CONSIGUEN LOS TRES PRIMEROS Y TAMPOCO LAS VERSIONES EN ITALIANO"
5,Nek is Italy's Sting,"Nek has a great voice and great lyrics. He can have very upbeat music or very soothing music, and his voice suits both. He is very supportive of his fan base and a very interactive artist. My family is of Italian descent on one side and we love his music. But I think anyone can enjoy Nek."
1,Dont waste your time,"I would have givin this book a 0 star but that option wasnt availabe.This author really needs to do his research all over again.For instace on page 7 he talks about the ""7 pillars of islam""when actually there only is 5 PILLARs in Islam.This might not seem like a big deal but througout this book you find little lies here and there.And by the time you finish the book it turns into one big lie.The author mentions that Saddam gassed his people but FAILS to mention that it was our government of the USA that supplied it to him.He protrays Bush and his administration as heros bet he feels dumb now after we found no WMDs and that we screwed the whole nation up.For some truth read ""forbidden truth"".And also read the PNAC doctrine.Dont waste your time with this book."
1,Crap,"Saddam was a horrible tyrant, there is no doubt about that. But I dont think many Americans have the right to say that. We supported Saddam all through the 8o's even after he gassed his own people. Now, we are waging a war to get rid of him and try him for war crimes. How do we do that? We commit a war crime, aggression, and kill 20,000 iraqi civilians to get rid of him. Funny how we are trying him for a crime he committed in the 80's considering afterwards we supported his regime."
3,Only 7 actual songs!!!!!,"Don't be mistaken, this 17 track record is not an album! It's an EP! Out of the 17 tracks, only 7 are real songs (they are good songs however). The remaining 10 tracks are all interludes and a few instrumentals. If you want a more complete album by the MJ's, check out their newest LP ""Black Sands Ov Eternia""."
3,tantalised but soo frustrated,I was so loving this book until I realised it is basically a gallery of her work and with not a pattern in sight. Well worth drooling over but not a 'how to' book unless you want to use a magnifying glass on each photo to work out how each is stitched and no projects to complete yourself. Will keep it for the facinating artwork.
3,hi,worked the first time but not the second time maybe cause i forgot to refidgerate it the second time maybe it was i was sick the second but it worked real good the first time but the second time it worked 0 also when it worked the first time i gained 1/3 the weight back on the hand i'm a slight bit smaller than i was before 5 months later but this only works like for 10 lbs at the very most plus i combined it the first time with other things but when i stoped i gained most of the weight back the second time i bought the drink i got deathly sick cause i forgot to refedegerate it and it didn't work at all i was very dispaponted the second time it might of been because i forgot to refedgerate it i'm buying it one more time cause the first time i used i got my ribs to stick out but the weight came back two weeks later when i try it one more time i will post the results here happy new years yall bye =lisa g
4,Thunderbolts,"This is a somewhat glamorized view of American P-47 pilots during WWII. P-47 bases were often located very close to the front lines and usually had almost no amenities. My uncle flew Thunderbolts in the summer and fall of 1944 almost exclusively in support of ground troops. He flew 25 missions until he was killed in November.The story is simplistic, but fairly entertaining. I bought it for the action shots of the P-47 and the gun camera film showing what these guys did and what a dangerous job it was. Unfortunately, some of the dogfighting and strafing runs show Japanese planes being attacked. I guess they didn't have enough film from Europe, or maybe they just didn't know.Good cast with Robert Stack and Edmund O'brien and Rock Hudson acting goofy in his first role.Overall, a worthwhile buy if you like Thuinderbolts."
3,OK,Fighter Squadron / This is a good flick but lacks imagination bad plot tries to be funny and serious hard to do with a WWII movie. I rate this movie as OK for 2 reasons . 1st reason it shows the P-47 Thunderbolt very few movies do. 2nd reason actual combat footage..Reasons not to like P-51 Mustangs playing German fightersthere were enough German fighters around should have used those primarily Bf-109'sThe markings on the aircraft were not correct Expecially D-Day markings when fliming the D-Day missions there were none Major FUbar
3,Fighter Squadron,"A rather campy story, but if you like WWII air movies it has some good scenes. I had seen it sometime ago and was glad to see it was available and at a reasonable price. Not a TOP GUN, but taken in its time frame not a bad movie"
1,poor picture quality,"Bought this one because I already had a 32"" Philips LCD which was perfect. In a side by side comparison the 42"" plasma was terrible. This was really obvious when looking at objects with straight lines. The 42"" plasma showed them as unstable - wavy lines - very hard to watch this after seeing what the picture should be on the 32"" LCD.I sent it back. Unfortunately - there is a hefty restocking fee - so it cost me to send it back but I couldn't live with this set."
5,Excellent TV,"I bought this TV in Brandsmart USA 3 months ago for $799. I own an LG and a Samsung (both HDTV) and the picture of this TV it's very superior to the other two (really natural image). The menus are very easy to understand, and the sound is great. The quality of this TV is equal or even better to other TV's that cost you hundreds more. I really, really recommend this TV."
4,Over a year old.... No Problems,"I lose sound switching from analog to digital.... but that might be in my offbrand hdmi cable.... tv is nice, picture is awesome, sound not the BEST, but works good."
1,Horrible,"I am on my third 42 inch phillips ambilight. Thank God for the Best Buy service plan. Yes, that's right. 3 Phillips Tv's in 3 years. All get a red streak vertically right down themiddle of the picture. Never again. Want ambilight. Turn on a lamp."
3,"Way cool, but missing a big key","Really awesome cooler. I've had it for two years now.Not the best at instillation, but that's ok, it's big enough for a lot of drinks an ice.BUT, two, TWO very important flaws in this cooler.1. There is only one handle on the whole thing! How is one person supposed to carry this with 30 cans and a 10 lbs. bag of ice? With two people it's still tough because of the awkward large round shape!2. Small air valves are not fun when you've got a large tube to inflate. Really needs a boston valve!"
3,Just ok,"The cooler is a great concept, however after the first use it already had puncture holes in the bottom. The patch kit didn't work very well and we had to trash the cooler after just one use. Wish it had a more substantial bottom to protect from rocks and other items that are in any river."
2,Love the cooler but zipper broke,I love the cooler it holds a alot. My problem with it is the zipper broke the insertion pin on the zipper broke of the second time I used the cooler. If you buy this DO NOT TAKE OF THE LID!
5,Pretty good product,These are great for organizing cords and I love that they're re-useable. I haven't tried chaining them together but they can hold some pretty big cords so it's not a huge deal.
5,Cord Mess Defeated,"I have saved every cord and cable that came with any device that I have purchased since 1992. I had a rats nest of cords about 2 feet thick. I used a couple of rolls of these velcro cable ties and now I have nice, neat cord storage bins. I even found a short extension cord I needed this morning in about 2 minutes, would have taken half an hour in the old mess just to find it. then I would have had to untangle it. Best part is you can permanently leave the ties on your cords when you use then so they don't get lost! If you have ever used zip ties and had to cut them to move your cables then this is also a great product."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"Product works, but not very well. The strapping is thin and does not grab well. I would return it but I am too late. My bad!"
3,Handy!,"These velcro strip ties are really handy! Lots of little uses for them. Great for tying cables together, strapping your umbrella to your book bag, and other ""tying X to Y"" uses. The only complaint is that they don't work for attaching things together, as they're not adhesive and they're self-sticking."
5,Just ordered yesterday - and received today!,This is a great product! It was super cheap and is perfect for the job. I just placed my order yesterday and already received it!
3,Received item 4 weeks after ordering,When ordering this item don't order from the Ace Hardware outlet. It took over 4 wks to arrive but the worst part was when I called and emailed for help. They already had my money and even though it was a problem with the shipped THEY REFUSED to get involved. As far as they were concerned they got their money and the item was out the door so that was good enough.I ended up going to Target and in the hardware section they have the same ties. The ones in the computer/entertainment section cost more but where the tools are they have nice 3M ones for cheap.
1,These things bite,"I've tried these cable ties and they stink. The Velcro-like hooks and loops are tiny, which is why you get so many on a roll. But those tiny hooks and loops just don't hold. You might think you get a lot for your money, but I recommend the heavier colored Velcro cable/wire ties. I have them on power cords, network wires, and equipment wires in my lab. They're easy to use and the colors let me code the types of wires I have bundled. Buy these dinky ties and you'll want a refund. I just threw a roll in the trash."
5,Great deal,"I have been looking to clean up all my cables and cords around the house and these work great. Not too bulky, easy to handle and just works like they should."
4,really really useful,Have been looking for these velcro ties for some time. These are really great for tidying up all the cables and wires
5,Can't believe I hesitated on buying these.,"Fabulous product, just as described. Much easier to keep these around instead of looking for rubber bands or tape or whatever else."
4,Great for the price,These ties work quite well but I don't expect them to last as long as some others I have used but are still a great value.
2,OK,The ties work OK for a small number of cables at a time. The loop at the end is weak and can break if you pull too tight. The material is kind of cheap but functional if you are careful.
5,Cable Management Simplified,"I've used more than a few 'cable management' schemes in my life, but these little buggers have made life easy. I love the design, that simplifies adding or removing cables from a bundle, keeps things organized, and when you're not using a cable, you just wrap it up in a hoop with one of these... I have a big bag full of cables and took an evening to go through and put one of these on every one, and wrap them all in loops... No more rat's nest!Solid construction, good design, and easy to use. But after about 100 of them, you'll be sore under your thumbnail from pulling the edges free..."
4,They work,"Length:: 1:28 MinsThey're not expensive, thick velcro ties, but they get the job done. I just want to neatly wrap the cords to all the gadgets I've obtained as of late. Mainly, power cords for tablets, cameras and such. They do the job - nothing more, nothing less. The price was great for the amount you get, too.Pack contained:1 roll 25 grey1 roll 25 blackEach tie is on a roll of 25 ; the end of each tie is perforated so you can just tug and detatch it from the next tie on the roll"
5,These are great,I love these. I put the role of black ones out in my garage and the gray ones on my computer desk. They work great. If I ever run out I will buy again.
3,Light Duty!,"I needed to keep microphone and instrument cables organized in my studio and for live gigging. I bought a pack of these straps thinking they were the thicker version, of which I already have several. These straps are pretty thin and light-duty. I broke a couple of the ends just pulling them off of the roll. They will also lose their grip after some use and/or being thrown around on dirty venue floors.If you need to continuously tie and untie Velcro straps, look elsewhere. If you need to organize some home stereo cables, this is your ticket."
5,Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Ties,"Simply put, this is an outstanding product for the price - best I have found anywhere! Great, superb vendor pricing on this item. Thanks - I'll definitely be ordering more and other items at this vendors site."
2,Look closer at the picture of the item on Amazon,"I was very disapointed in this item. Take a closer look at the picture on here you will see that even in this picture the links are not closed up. They were not on the 2 necklaces I ordered either. This thing falls apart, it is extremely dusty and the cubes are so pitted. The sides of the cubes are horrible too, not at all even looking. I wouldn't buy this again and sure would be returing the two I bought if I had time to order a new Christmas present."
5,One of TD's best albums!,"This is definitely one of Tangerine Dream's best albums. It is an album for a warm summer evening... Especially the first two songs (Song of the Whale part One and Two) are among the best compositions Tangerine Dream ever made, with a blend of electronic and rock (really good guitar parts). The mood is relaxing and melancholic (especially the piano intro of Part Two).The other, shorter pieces, are great as well, but are not in the league of the two Song of the Whale parts. If you like relaxing-but-not-boring music, this album is highly recommended."
2,I just watched this.,"This is a 30 minute tape from 1990.I have just finished watching all of the SCTV DVD sets as well as into reading Dave Thomas's SCTV book. (Great book BTW)This tape was a little disappointing.First the concept of ""Count Floyd"" doing a self help video in the daylight (someone's backyard) is pretty silly. I can't believe they actually greenlit this stupid idea.Second its hard to decide what you are watching. Is this a tape to help you make better home video.. Or is it just something funny to watch. The main problem is it more or less fails on both counts. (see I wrote count!)SCTV went off the air in 1983 and this tape came out 7 years later. Nearly everybody must have forgotten about Count Floyd by then.. Why expect people to even understand the comedy?If you are looking for another side of Joe or even some tips on video.. This attempt is a complete waste of your money. Worth maybe $3 not $12 plus S&H.;GENE"
1,Terrible costume...not what the picture states,"I ordered this costume for my 2yr old, but when it arrived, the costume in the bag did not even resemble the picture. For starters, the 2-3 size toddler was so small, you would be lucky to get it on a 1 yr old. The ""so-called red thick sash"" turned out to be a very small piece of black string. And they do not take returns, so it just will end up in the garbage. What a waste...I will never order fromt this seller again!!!"
5,singers' singer,This is jazz singing-or any kind of singing- at its best. Carmen's phrasing and clarity are a model for anyone who wants to know what sophisticated mature singing is all about.
2,Creative Machine Stitching,"It was not what I expected. Can use very little of the book. However, was good price."
3,"awesome third person battles, but its multiplayer only","i have windows xp and it runs great. its fun to play, and in depth which i like but you havce to play in multiplayer mode, there isn't really an offline or single player mode. the third person shootouts, even with just the computer is awesome and the upgrades are really fun to mix up"
2,Peeling Paint!,These blocks are adorable but the paint is peeling off of them and they have only been out of the bag one time since they were sent to us as a gift. Of course the first thing the baby wants to do is put them in her mouth! The horror of seeing little bits of white flaky paint in her mouth was just too much.
5,Great Blocks!,"I use these as a photo prop and they are so bright and colorful. At first I thought they were too expensive, but have been well worth it."
3,Cute blocks,"The blocks are really cute - I use them for photography. I do with on the 'extra' blocks they included different letters instead of just vowels. However, I love the blocks and use them all the time!"
3,"Colgate Simply white is simple, fast, effective","Dry your teeth, brush on the gel...keep lips off teeth for 30 seconds- you're done! And I could tell a difference after the first 2 applications. I used to smoke, I drink coffee & wine and this clear gel really lightened my teeth. It's day 10 of 14 and I'm satisfied already. I recommend this product to anyone who would like whiter teeth without spending a fortune and having to deal with trays,etc."
2,Messy...,"Okay, so I picked this product because it slightly cheaper than the Crest Whitestrips and because I was new to this. It was easy to apply and doesn't require 30 min. However, the down side was the dripping gel/saliva mixture that I ended up swallowing or else having a trail of saliva. This reason, along with the taste discouraged me to continue through the 14 days. I would find myself forgetting. I noticed very slight changes after a week or so."
3,Not bad for the price,"I tried this product because I was a big skeptical about the new tooth whitening products that are coming out and because this was much cheaper. I thought I would rather spend half as much on the gel than the Crest White Strips. Also, the Colgate gel has a money back guarentee. . .you just have to save your recpiept and the packaging. After using the gel for about 5 days, I noticed my teeth were a little bit more white. . . but nothing that anyone else would notice. Also, my gums and teeth became sensitive so I had to take a couple days off. After finishing the 14 day process, I decided that I really didn't get the whitening that I was looking for. I sent in the reciept and the packaging and got a refund. I'm now going to cough up the money and get the Crest White Strips and see if I can achive what I'm looking for. This product is only good if you are diligent about completing the 14 day process and not looking for dramatic results."
4,Nice gel,This product got my teeth whiter in 2 weeks. People that want whiter smile should use this product. The product is easy to use and pretty fairly priced.
1,Did not whiten my teeth,"I followed the instructions of this product and saw no noticable difference in whiteness after 14 days. Since it did not do what it was supposed to, I don't recommend it."
3,Where is the white??,Ok so I am a thirteen girl who wants the best smile in school! I bought this because it is cheep. I think it is hard because you never know if it is dry so you can let your lips touch it.I haven't noticed any change at all!! I am verry disapointed because I spent the last of my Birthday money on this and it dosen't work! Take my advice and buy the crest whitestrips my friend has them and her smile is now the best
3,Good and a halfq,"Basically, this is the buiding blocks of Soft Machine's music onThirdand after.Those loops and hums that the band used to play over in the early 1970s took a lot of blood, sweat, and razor blades. Painstakingly edited with 1970 technology, which meant litterally slicing magnetic tape at just the right point and then (scotch) taping it to the ajoining piece you wanted.So if you like ambient music or space rock, or really, really like Soft Machine, this is for you. These are BACKROUNDS. You will not get the Soft Machine flesh you hear on the classic albumsBut you have to admire the labor of love--no one sat and did this unless they were ready to make some serious music, and we all know that story with the Softs.Hugh Hopper did the liner notes, saying he could now do this in an hour or two.I guess when digital technology came a long, he got a lot more sleep and a much closer shave."
5,Seduction of an intellectual snob.,"I like this book, like it a lot in fact. With only one or two exceptions the chapters are insightful and sometimes inspiring. It truly offers a tour of modern America, and a wonderfully diverse tour at that - sure the states differ, but so do the wrting styles of the various authors. I bought four copies to give as holiday gifts, and each of the young recipients has been seduced into reading chapter after chapter. Personally, I went first to ""Texas"" and Molly Ivins, then ""New Mexico"" with Tony Hillerman, ""Wisconsin"" childhood home of my father, ""Upstate NY"" my childhood home, etc. etc. Lots of reasons to seek out various chapters."
5,What is says below is all I want to know,"It was a good book but I would like to know what five things you thought Mary Arden faced and how she solved each one of them. Yours Always , Angie"
3,Alice and a lot of pretense,"Juliet Binoche makes any movie worth seeing and her performance here was exceptional. Unfortunately, the story is in places unbelievable and occasionally absurd. The actor who plays Martin does not often match the ability of Ms. Binoche. He has his moments but often comes off flat and boring.The movie has a lot to recommend if you can get past the occasional posturing and the pretentious dialogue."
2,Too long,"Although the book is only 159 pages long, my underlinings of informative sections would amount to 4 pages at the most. In other words, the book is full of anecdotes and statements of the obvious but business insight is alarmingly lacking."
4,Single fin surfer,"Interesting iudea, some good shooting, but as a surfer since 1962, now retired, sometimes the action had a too strong déjà vu factor."
5,This is as good as it gets,"This movie is great. It's got a great idea, look and soundtrack and the surfing is even better. Also don't let the longboarding scare you off if you're not into that type of thing, these guys are charging and they're doing some amazing stuff. I can't think of another recent surf flick where you get to see someone drop a 9'6"" deep into a heavy day at Pipe."
2,A disappointment,"I guess for me this is another example of caveat emptor. I bought this largely based on the reviews here, and I was pretty disappointed. The surfing just wasn't that interesting - way way too much nose riding, and not much else. OK nose riding is fine, but there is a lot more about longboarding than hanging 5. The best parts of the movie are the beginning and end - where the shaper describes his work and goes out for an early morning session. Now THAT was great - he ripped, and it was great to see him really using the whole board and the whole wave. I wish the movie had just been about him."
1,disappointed,"I do not surf , but I enjoy watching good films about surfing .I am sad to say I was very disappointed in this film .I can appreciate the idea behind this film but it was very boring to watch .Surf films I have watched and enjoyed and rate 4 and 5 are Billabong Odyssey , Riding Giants , Endless Summer 2 and Step into Liquid ."
2,"Good, but not something to watch mutliple times","The movie is cool because it offers different surfing than normally seen in surf movies, but I buy surf films to watch over and over. Which I would not do with this movie. Just not enough action."
5,Surfing version of the traveling pants :}),"This is a film following a single fin longboard ridden by multiple different surfers from Japan to Hawaii.Cool intro with the shaper Tyler from El Segundo, CA.Compared to most surf movies which suffer from serious repetition of the same surfing moves over and over set to questionable music, this movie is actually a movie.There are interesting characters with good stories. The parts of the movie where the surfers narrate are great, especially the scenes in Japan.I love the cinematography and attention to detail of the director to make this a watchable film with a cool vibe.One of my favorite surf films."
5,singlefin yellow,"For those who are into longboarding, this is the best film (documentary) I've seem. The photography and music are excellent, the story is very well documented and interesting. Tyler is not only a great shaper but by far the best rider of single fin yellow. It is by far the coolest surfing movie!"
2,Boring,"I recommend paradigm shift over this documentary. Of course I was disappointed, I wanted to see more surf and less talk."
2,Poor quality. Seems like a copied CD.,"Love the movie, the content but very poor quality recording. Not sure if it was the quality or if it is a burned DVD."
3,Surfing film with a different twist.,"Much of the surfing footage is okay, but the story line is just that, a story line. I am glad that there is as much surfing in there as there is otherwise it would have been a give away. It's one of those films I've watched once and may watch again in a few years. Contrary to Step into Liquid which I watch at least once every three of four months. Okay, but far from great."
2,Much smaller than i expected.,"It's super tiny..... The barrel is about the size of a marker. i don't know what i was expecting, but this is pretty much only good for straightening the front of my hair. It would not be possible to use it to curl all of my hair. At least it lights easily and it is small enough to fit in a purse."
1,Does not heat up properly,"This product does not supply enough heat for a curling iron. Packing is nice, but product is too small to handle and does not curl properly."
1,Thermacell Cordless compact curler,"Although a great size for travel or for on-the-go, this curler does not heat up enough to be able to style hair."
3,okay depending on your need/use,"I ordered this to take to the gym thinking it's smaller size and lack of cord would be easier than carrying my iron back and forth. I only curl my bangs and my hair is fine. I don't like the size or finish on the barrel. I don't use the brush attachment because those never work for me. On the other hand, it does heat quickly and it's easy to carry and store. I have used it about 6-7 times and it uses very little fuel. So it's not a bad product...it's just not right for me."
4,Is this a Brush or a Curler?,I am looking for the curling brush only not the convertible type that you change the brush to the curling barrel. Thanks
1,Total Rip-off!,"This album is mostly clips of Bob Guccione Jr., smugly talking about how ""close"" he and Kurt were, and tossing out boring antecdotes to that end. There is only ONE interview with Kurt, which lasts for about 45 seconds and you can barely hear it. The only Courtney Love clips are the suicide note reading, which we've all heard before. And they BLEEP out her swear words when she's reading the note! From reading the index I thought I was going to hear interesting interviews. Gavin Rossdale and Andy Summers have one short clip each, and neither is particularly insightful. This album could be summed up by saying ""Kurt was depressed. He committed suicide! People were sad. Is anyone to blame? Probably not. People miss him!"" Don't waste your money."
4,My First,This is my first ginger grater so I was unsure as to what I was looking for except it should be porcelain. It works great except for getting all of the ginger out of the crevices. Is there a trick to that?
5,Palani Vaughans Best with the Kings own vol.1,Waited a lond time for this cd to be available again. Lost my chance the first time. Got a second chance and the cd was worth waiting for. Enjoyed hearing his deep tenor voice.
5,Great choice,I upgraded from a much earlier version. This one runs just fine on my new iMac with Leopard. It is easy to use and powerful. I am getting ready to upgrade again to the CS3 version soon.
4,Dreamweaver Is Helpful For Amateurs,"For an amateur in web design, Dreamweaver 8 helped me along without having to learn all the numerous coding that goes into creating a webpage. I would have liked if the program had basic templates available to use, at least for the layout of the page. Perhaps it does and I just haven't been able to figure it out. It is hard to create fancy designs if you aren't a web design professional, so the page I've been working on thus far is pretty basic and not very flashy. Other than that, the software is very easy to learn and I enjoy using it."
1,Can't transfer license from Windows to Mac,"I recently switched Windows to Mac. Since Dreamweaver includes both versions, I thought I could deactivate my Windows machine, and install it on the Mac. After calling their customer service department twice, I was told that this is not possible. Once you activate the product on one platform, you have to buy it again if you want to use it on a different platform.I might be willing to pay for an upgrade if they were offering a Universal Binary, but currently they are not. They might even view Intel Mac's as a different plaform the Power PC Mac's and try to charge me again if they release an Intel version.Because their licensing is such a pain, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Sweet and sparkling!,"Frisky songs of love and springtime in the form of madrigals, ballads and jaunty dances. I can't help but smile when listening to the rich, cheerful, heartfelt music of the Toronto Consort. On this recording in particular, the recorder virtuosity of Allison Melville stands out as she imitates birds in several numbers with well-placed chirps and flutter-tonguing. Tenor Paul Jenkins also gets a chance to shine as an improvisational harpsichord soloist. This spirited ensemble continues their seasonal approach to recording with their subsequent release, ""The Little Barley-Corne: Winter Revels from the Renaissance"". For other fun madrigals from the Renaissance, you might also enjoy the King's Singers in ""All At Once Well Met: English Madrigals"", and ""The King's Singers' Madrigal History Tour: Italy, England, France, Spain, Germany"" (with the Consort of Musicke)."
3,"A good approach, yet a little limited","David Perkins is one of the authorities on literary history, but this book is not quite a masterpiece on the topic. One of the main distinctions(encyclopedic vs. narrative literary history) seems an obvious one, but it does not give a clear insight.The ""encyclopedic literary history"" is also narrative, so the classification seems too artificial. Still, the book is a very good introduction to the topic, before entering the complex works of the most influential authors in the topic, namely, Hayden White."
1,"No plot, no character development, no story. Disappointing.","No plot, no character development, no story, no nothin. The authors obviously know their science, as displayed in the long, technical and largely irrelevant suffix to the book, but even the scenes of great destruction aren't that vividly described. (See Greg Bear's ""Eon"" for that!)Avoid this book."
2,A pale copy of a much better book,"This book recounts the return to the Dyson Sphere encountered in the Star Trek Next Generation episode ""Relics"". There are some fun nods to the Horta race seen in the original series and the comic books, and a rushed tour of the giant structure in what appear to be its final hours. The book is very short and not particularly good. All the regular characters play their parts, but there isn't enough time for much to happen before the book comes to an unsatisfying end.This book is very similar to a much better book titled ""Excession"", by author Ian M. Banks. I say this mostly because of the way both novels end. Take my advice and seek out the better book."
2,"Disappointing, Eagerly awaited and let down badly","Dyson sphere promised so much in a title taken from one of the best star trek episodes in the season, However the book takes too much time to explore the relationships between the horta and Picard that it loses it's way, Research is one thing but we readers don't want chemical analyses and atomic structure explained like we dropped out of high school chemistry, we want action and suspense, I waited months to get hold of this copy and now it is filed in the ""Read only when depressed"" section of my library. Believe me read this and you can throw your idea of a good book down the drain along with what ever you spent to buy it. Avoid this and go straight to the Double Helix series, Its a good read."
1,Not good Trek,"""Dyson Sphere"" has a lot of hard science, but not a lot of hard plot. Many things happen in this book almost by magic, without much description of how or why things are happening. The characters are very two dimensional, to the point of making the worst televised Trek episode look like an Academy-award winning film. I do not recommend ""Dyson Sphere."""
1,Why?,"""Why?"" sums up this one quite nicely. You know, Trek novels in general are a fantastic way to get insights in characters that maybe got one ep devoted to them a season ... Characters like Geordi and Beverly for example, who rarely got to spout more than technobabble. So, after a drought of non-serialized TNG novels, imagine my disappointment after reading Dyson Sphere, which seemed to be more of a showcase for the authors' knowledge of the arcane rather than a showcase for any of the characters. I wasn't impressed. If I want a science-heavy novel, I'll pick up Diane Duane's collected works any day of the week. At least she remembers who she's writing about. I was expecting a little more considering half of the writing team here was behind A Fury Scorned, which, while not exactly a Trek tour de force, wasn't completely unreadable. Dyson Sphere, however, is just that. Sorry, fellas."
1,I didn't get it.,"I got myself through this book, only because I kept thinking the next page would draw me in. But it never did. Nothing flowed very well, and about the only thing that really held my interest were the essays by the authors at the end.But try as I might, I simply could not envision the inside of this Sphere or what was happening to it, and the story narrative did nothing to help, nevermind the stilted, choppy dialogue.And Scotty, where the heck was Scotty??!!! Too many mentions of his poor ship, but no sign of my favorite engineer. I didn't check the timeline, so I don't know if he was already with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers by the time this book was written, but maybe not. Doesn't matter, he should have been part of this story. Heck, the S.C.E. should have been here, not the Enterprise!If you ask me, the only characters with any depth at all were made of rock. Better you simply watch the TNG episode, ""Relics,"" and be done with it."
1,Just trying to save eager trek readers some undue pain,"I have observed that when I give a product a poor review, I tend to get dinged on my review. However, this is an attempt to do you all a favor and I strongly recommend that another trek title be purchased as this was just a waste of time for me. I echo others who thought this was simply ""very poor trek material"".So with that in mind, please do yourselves a favor and don't read this poor excuse of a trek novel."
3,It was ok but it needed more action!,"I think that the book did need more action I think that would be one of the things someone would tell me after they read this book, but I have to say the idea of them going to the Dyson Sphere and trying to figure out if the BORG really built this hudge Sphere in space is cool! In general I think the characters made the story worth reading."
1,Way below par for the series.,"There was more hard science SF here than is typical of Star Trek novels, and the authors clearly know their science. BUT: They are not very good writers, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, the plot is thin, the philosophy is weak, and the ending is trite. Not recommended except for the collector who has to have every ST novel."
2,"OK, but dull.","If you like that kind of technical/ factual Star Trek then this book won't disappoint. It has a really good concept - did the Borg really create the Dyson Sphere? - and is well written. But any one who likes lots of action and excitement in their ST books, then my advice is: do not buy this book!Maybe its just me, but I thought this book had too much scientific stuff and too little going on. The characters were the only thing going for a book that was way too short (it had less than 200 pages!). The book had two very talented writers but still reads like it was written in a rush to finish before a deadline.If you read it you'll probably end up really confused, as half of the crew's decisions don't seem to make any sense at all. It's the kind of book that gets read once and then never again.I give it two stars - one for being a Star Trek book and the other for good descriptive/factual writing."
3,Just too short,"I didn't mind the science behind the story (although, I wouldn't want every Trek book to be this scientific, but it was eye-opening), but I thought an idea this big, literally, deserved more pages, more exploration, more answers. Things had only just begun, only to end just as suddendly. Almost all paperback Trek books seem to be around 300 pages, so I felt cheated that 30 or so pages were used as personal biographies of the authors. The story itself should have been expanded to at least 500 pages. It was nice to re-visit the sphere."
1,Not a good read.,"I was bored by the first couple of chapters of this book, but I read on, curious to see what would happen. Eventually, I got too bored and put the book down because I have better things to read. Don't be fooled by the title, this book is boring."
5,A better book than it is credit for.,"I don't know what so many people seem to think is wrong with this book. I thought the Horta crew was interesting, since there never was much talk about the Horta since their main episode. Picard kept in character with his need to go into the sphere and be the archeology lover he is. Though some characters didn't say much, that does not take away from the story. There doesn't need to be a chapter per character to be a good novel. The science was very evident, the authors obviously did their research. The sphere itself was well-described, and the manakin people showed evidence of new life beginning, and unfortunately a quick ending. Using the sphere in a story was a good idea, and I enjoyed it. All in all, it was an excellent book, and don't be afraid to try it."
2,Not much of a plot.,"Rather than being an action-oriented, plot-driven novel, this is a concept novel; the concept in question is: ""Remember that Dyson Sphere from the episode 'Relics'? It sure is BIG!"" Okay, we get it. But that isn't NEARLY enough of a concept to make an interesting story, and there just really isn't much else here.On the plus side, the writing itself is competent, and the characters stay pretty well within concept, so it's nowhere near the WORST Star Trek book I've ever read. But there just isn't enough story to make it anywhere near mediocre, either."
1,Lousy,"Having read over 60 of the various Star Trek books written, this has got to be the worst. Poor plot, little character development, it just doesn't work. Only reason to read this is for the right to say you've read all the various ST books written."
1,absolutely awful!!!!!,"I got this in the hopes it would work on the ""dry skin"" areas. First of all it smells like plastic, so really makes you want to spray it on you and secondly it turned the palms of my hands VERY dark brown to the point that they looked black. So instead of doing what its made to do, it made me smell like plastic and turned my palms black. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
4,You don't need a Wayback machine,"Just get a CD like this one to get a broad brush review of the popular hits of the late 1500s. While I would have liked a few more recorder pieces, almost every cut was interesting in its own way. If you want just one early music CD with English songs, this is probably the one to get."
5,an unparalleled study,"It's a great blessing that this and its companion volume have been reissued. More recent histories have the advantage of hindsight, so that of course much more of the present is available to illuminate the long historical story. Still, these books lose none of their thoroughness and insight in the light of more recent studies. There is much to learn here."
4,Good product,"If you've never ordered a canvas stretcher before (I hadn't) then let me warn you that each one comes in four pieces and you put it together. Based on the picture, I thought they came pre-made. The joints are very tight, which is good for the finished product (it's pretty strong) but unless you're He-Man you'll probably need a hammer to put them together.I ordered nine these for an art project and I think they're great! The reason I gave 4 stars is because on a few of the pieces the corners were slightly off, leaving a bit of an overhang. This is not the sellers fault, rather the manufacturers, but I thought it was worth noting. Once it's covered with canvas, or in my case t-shirts, you probably won't notice it. The shipping seems a little high if you're only buying one, but I bought nine and the shipping was the same amount. And when I got the box it was pretty heavy so I think the shipping is justified. All in all, I would order this product from this seller again."
2,"attractive and nice finish, but the fuel evaporates quickly",Very nice polished finish. Only problem is that the fuel will evaporate within a week because it is not well sealed. I now have a Windmill torch lighter which is excellent and hardly loses any fuel through evaporation.
4,Wild and Woolly,"The Muffins had two sides to them -- the heavily-rehearsed fast changes of ""Manna Mirage"" and ""Open City,"" and the furious jams of the largely improvised-in-the-studio ""185"" and the limited-edition live ""Air Fiction.""Both were brilliant in their own ways. At times it is hard to believe this is the same band, although just enough reference points are included to prevent the listener getting lost in the forest.If you like Djam Karet (or even the other Muffins) you owe it to yourself to check out this one too."
2,nice try but it leaks,"Best-1 feeders leak. They seem to have a problem with the mold for the bottom 2 pieces. After a few weeks, it deforms, and then leaks around every rib, because they don't use a gasket . .we solved the problem by coating one of the pieces with a bit of petroleum jelly, but it is a lot of extra hassle, and could easily have been solved with a better mold for the bottom pieces. After I called them twice, (and they did not return my calls) they said not to leave them in the afternoon sun, because it heats the air in the bottle and floods the bottom, making it leak. They said that was in their instructions, too, but I read them three times to be sure, and that isn't in there.It IS easy to clean and attracts lots of birds"
1,"More like ""Wasp Feeder""","I recently bought this feeder to replace my other hummingbird feeder that was beginning to rust. I didn't like the apperence of this one, but thought I would simply purchase a feeder that was best for the birds, and not my eyes. Since installing this feeder I have had at least one wasp, bee, or fly on the feeder every second of the day. It has gotten so bad, that the wasps actually fly after the birds when they come to feed. What a waste of money!"
5,hummingbird feeders,Best humming bird feeder I've ever used. Easy to clean. I have four and need more. I have had many over the years but Best-1 is unbeaten in my opinion.
4,What You See Is Not What You Get,The picture shows the newer single rail version. What I got in June 08 was the older version that I felt compelled to modify. Pictures should accurately represent what is purchased. Seller never responded to my inquiry. That said the feeder is fine after the mods.
4,The hummingbirds seem to like it :),"Nice little design - sturdy - we have one hummingbird that primarily uses it, with two others that sneak in every once in awhile... we need to get a few more of these :)"
4,Good Christmas disk,"I'm new to karaoke so I haven't heard a lot of the other brands out there, but I really liked this disk. It had most of the christmas songs I wanted to sing and they sounded pretty good. You really get a lot of songs in this package for the price. I especially liked that there are vocal versions of each song because sometimes you forget the words while you're singing and it helps you remember."
4,Christmas Karaoke,"I had never purchased any Christmas karaoke before, and this was my first set. It was a great investment! I used it at my family Christmas party and it was a huge hit, especially with my 10-year old daughter. I recommend this product to all those with plans for holiday parties."
5,"Yamato, Launch!!!","An excellent compilation of music from the third, and seldom seen, season of Uchu Senkan Yamato ( aka Star Blazers ), and a superb companion to the original, earlier, shorter release score. If you love good music, or need to fill a few holes in your Yamato material, this one's for you."
4,too much fantasy and magic,"This is my first Sandra Heath book, and she's a terrific writer, but I agree with the reader who said there's too much magic. I would have enjoyed more romance and less fantasy. Otherwise, I enjoyed the book."
2,dull magic,"With every aspect of the plot taken in hand by magic, there's not much point in having characters. He's rich and handsome, she's poor but good, however, since once someone casts a magic spell in the first scene to make them fall instantly in love there's not much more than can happen, and nothing does.Oh, Heath does write well. Here's hoping that in future she finds something to write about."
3,"No ISBN, wrong publisher listed, unknown copies","The authors answer questions from Hyperlink: We, Jean and Bill Bruce, are the authors and publishers of this book, The Power of the Thinker. The University of Texas at Tyler only PRINTED it; we paid for the printing. Students tested the book for us for future publications. They used the book without cost to them. SInce all but three books were returned to us, we wonder where these copies keep coming from, and, how can they be sold without an ISBN."
4,This Is What it is,"With Steve Albini at the controls and some very talented musicians in tow, Nina Nastasia's The Blackened Air makes for quite a record. Instrumentally everything sounds great, and the songwriting for the most part is solid. I could probably listen to Nastasia's voice singing just about anything and be perfectly content. ""So Little"" is a really good song, and ""This Is What It Is"" is an extraordinary song. The lyric about her having perfect pitch cracks me up every time. My sole complaint is that the record is a little long and the writing is not necessarily consisent all the way through. But I honestly would have bought the disc just for ""This Is What It Is."" Nice job."
3,It's A Hit or Miss Album,"Machine Head has been a band that has always kept my interest for at least three years. However, ""The Burning Red"" is an album that you should take warning on. At times, there are some somewhat thrash-reminscent tracks (""The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears""), some ballads (""Silver"", ""The Burning Red""), and then you have the controversial rapcore track ""From This Day"", which basically has previous fans turn their heads. The Police cover song, ""Message in a Bottle"", is a pretty good tune, but it's more ballad-esque and less groove thrash.My opinion: This album is far from their greatest and will never dethrone ""Burn My Eyes"", but it has its moments as well. Just stay away from the sloppily put together ""Supercharger"" and you'll be safe."
3,"Hits and Misses,Overall better than most crap you will find today.","Overall this is a tie for me with Supercharger for least favorite MachineHead CD....That being said this CD does contain some very good tracks..Exhale The Vile,The Burning Red,Nothing Left,The Blood the Sweat the Tears...Actually the more I think about it there are atleast 6 or so really excelent songs on this CD....However Crap songs like Desire to fire and and a few other songs that could have easily been sold of to make a Limp Bizkit CD bring the overall value of this CD way down...These songs will have you in a panic to get to the skip button in hopes nobody hears the crap."
4,different but good,"Ok time to review Machinehead, one of my favorite bands. I was a little surprised at the rap in here, but let's face it... THIS ALBUM STILL ROCKS! I mean how can you not love Robb Flynn? The man can play guitar, yell, sing great, and yeah I guess rap too! Any of you know any one else who can do that? I was hoping to get Robb's autograph at the show a while back on my Machinehead T-shirt! But damn it I couldn't get near the stage! But my point is buy this! You won't be dissapointed. Go for it Robb! You're the man! Those KIDS in Limp Bizkit and Korn could learn something from this band! And may I suggest Fear Factory and Meshuggah two other awesome bands!"
5,"MH's ""The Burning Red"" CD is awesome!!!","When i bought this cd i didn't know what to expect but when i listend to it it was great. All the songs are awesome! MH's new album is a mixture of Limp Bizkit, KoRn, and the MH of old put together. If you like Rock/Metal/Rap then buy this cd, its worth the money!"
2,Only two excellent tracks,"I saw Machine Head with Coal Chamber in Milwaukee,WI. The performancewas intense, but the cd lacks consistancy. Track 2 and TB,TS,TT (track 4) are amazingly awesome. There's definately some talent in those songs, but the rest of the cd is like the old stuff. Just your average metal band. Buy the cd though, track 2 and 4 is worth the money."
2,What is MH thinking?,"I have been a fan of Machine Head since the Burn My Eyes days. The band has always been one of my favorites. I have even gotten the chance to party with them... the most chill guys I'll ever meet. But, I would love to know what happened to change their style so much. Before they were a style all their own, and now I can easily compare them to Powerman 5000, and Korn. The Hip hop aspect of the album is dry. Although, I was satisfied with the last four tracks (including ""Message In a Bottle."") I found myself comparing the end of the album to track such as ""Block"" and ""I'm your god now."" But it all boils down to this, a loyal fan is now lost. I'm sure I wont be the only one. But, hey, if you are one of the people that goes for the teen ""freak rock"" such as Korn or whatever else is popular.. buy it. If you are looking for brutal ""**** it all"" music, you are better off with ""Burn My Eyes"" or ""The More Things Change."""
2,"The ill-fated ""new direction""","Machine Head has joined the long list of metal bands that have changed their musical direction. Unfortunately, this means that their music is less heavy and more mainstream. For fans of their first album, you might not enjoy the slower and ""hip-hop"" driven songs. But, if you like Limp Bizkit and Korn, this one could be for you."
2,Do Yourself a favor and borrow this cd instead of buying it,"Needless to say, I'm quite disappointed with TBR. It doesnt even compare to their previous albums. Machine Head brought in that hip hop crap and it totally ruins the whole record!! I found maybe one good song and the rest are trash. I'm not sure what they are trying to prove but its not working. I always thought of Machine Head as one of the premiere bands with brutal songs, kick a** riffs, and mind blowing guitars. Maybe I was wrong. Dont buy this album,"
2,I CAN'T BELIEVE THE SINGER IS RAPPING NOW,"THE BURNING RED IS A BIG LET DOWN. THE SINGER NEVER SHOULD HAVE STARTED RAPPING ON SOME OF THE SONGS. THE BLOOD,THE SWEAT,THE TEARS IS AN AWESOME SONG, BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT."
3,oh no... what happened ???,"this album is a real disappointment. after ""burn my eyes"" is one of the best metal albums and ""the more things change..."" still was a very good and solid cd. what happened here ? oh god, robb raps!!! that definitly sucks. also he sings!!! songs like ""message in a bottle"" really tear down the cd. all together this cd has its moment, the riffing is still good, it is well produced, there are some good songs on here (""five"", ""the blood the sweat and the tears"", ""desire to fire"" and ""from this day""). but it isn't a worthy followup to ""burn my eyes"" & ""the more things change..."". overall not a bad cd, but disappointing. i hate it when good bands change their concept to become more popular"
1,This cd is terrible!,"It doesn't even sound like machine head at all! It has alot of rap crap in it! That sucks! What happened to machine head? The first two albums rocked but this album doesn't even do that! If you like the first two albums you probably don't like this album at all because it sounds nothing close to who they where before! Fans of this album probably like limp bizkit,the new korn,the new metallica, slipknot or any other band who has sold-out!Go buy something that rocks! This sucks! Terrible!"
4,Just what you would expect from Machine Head!,"Well, they're at it once again. Machine Head can rock with the best of them. I had the pleasure of seeing them live with Slipknot and Coal Chamber. VERY intense show. Boy, Robb sure can rap when he wants. ""From This Day"" and ""Desire To Fire"" will prove that to you. ""Exhale The Vile"" is the beast of the cd; with so much power your head will fall off from it banging so much. They did a very interesting cover of The Police's ""Message In A Bottle"", which is a lot more melodic than what Sting and gang did. Drummer Dave McClain adds his mighty poundage with this recording, and is A LOT of fun to watch live. But, it's your typical Machine Head album, and if you like your rock REAL damn hard, ""The Burning Red"" is your deal."
4,tearin' it up,"Incredible! This is all I can say to describe this album. Before I ever got this album I had never even heard of Machine Head. I received this album from BMG without even wanting it, but when i listened to it I couldn't send it back. this album defines what speed-metal is all about. I've heard some of Machine Head's older music but I don't think it even compares to this album. Machine Head is what speed-metal is all about."
5,Why all the hate??,"This was my introduction to machinehead. I recieved this cd for christmas in 2001 and i only listened to one song (from this day) because i had heard it on the radio and i wasnt too into the whole thrash metal thing. I was looking through my old cd's and came upon this one and thought ""why not listen to the whole thing??""I was completely amazed at the musical ability of this band on the album. The harmonies never seem out of place and every song follows an angry metal syle i have never heard before. Silver is one hell of a song, The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears absolutely shreds all the way through. And i was always one who loved depressed rock ballads, so the title track, the burning red, is what got me hooked on the band. It may have been more mainstream than hardcore metal fans would like, but true MachineHead fans can appreciate this cd, and its as good as any to start the fascination."
2,Change???,"Well if you are expecting to hear your straight hard driving tunes your are use to while listening to machine head your in for a surprise. This album sounds to me like they are trying to cash in with the trend that Korn and Limp Bizkit have started.So if you are into Limp Bizkit and Korn this is a cheap imitiation of their work. If you want straight hard driving metal listen to Soulfly,Pantera,Sepultura!!!"
3,Why have hip-hop in metal ?,Decent album could be better. Lose the hip-hop lyrics and beat. Logan left at the right time. Ditch Ahrue Luster and tell him to pull up his pants.
1,What a joke..... I want my money back.,"This CD gets one star because the system here does not let you give zero stars or a negative score. I have been a fan of machine head for ages and I really dig their other albums. However I can not say the same for this. It is pretty disappointing to hear the once mighty Machine head reduced to this. You'll laugh at the pathetic ""message in a bottle"" and ""from this day"" and feel sad when you remember how good Machine Head can be. I think that Roadrunner records should be ashamed of themselves for promoting this ""Album"" so heavily as it just proves that as a record company they are solely devoted to making money and not putting out good music. What a wasted oppurtunity......"
5,the best machine head release yet,"Ok, this isnt the machine head of old. so what? i love this cd. this is quite possibly the only rap-metal that i can say that i really enjoy. while i do wish logan was still around, the new guitarist did a good job with the style for this album.it was really cool to see them incorporate more and more melodic stuff as well as more rap vocalings. personal faves include desire to fire, nothings left,blood sweat and tears, silver, and the burning red. this is a cd any metal fan needs to add to their collection."
4,Only Sellouts Would Call This Band Sellouts,"The general sentiment among some of the reviewers about this album is that Machine Head has ""sold out."" My question is, why do you feel this way? Because there is a little bit of hip-hop flavor to the album? Since when does the inclusion of hip-hop energy make a band a ""sellout""? Hip-hop is an aggressive musical style, as is heavy metal. Why not then combine the two? Machine Head remain as heavy as ever, and ""The Burning Red"" proves it. Some seem to think that the hip-hop element of two of the songs on the album taints the entire album. But, I believe that it is rather subtle and only adds a little spice to the already aggressive tracks. Buy this CD for its raw aggression AND its willingness to experiment with new musical flavors."
4,Awesome,"This is one of the best CD's i have. It is hard and heavy, and still melodic. Making things interesting. It reminds me of Soulfly mixed with Fear Factory. So if you like those too bands, get this CD!!"
5,Best Machine Head CD,"Wow..really..what can I say? Wow. Ross Robinson has added another to his collection of great CD's. This is my favorite Machine Head...for some good reasons. The singer's voice (Flynn) has really come far in this album. The metal riffs on the guitar are toooo catchy. :-) Some stand out songs are ""The Blood The Sweat The tears"" ""I Defy"" ""Desire to fire"" Well..they are all pretty good actually. This CD also doesn't sound like it was recorded in some garage, so the sound quality plays a big factory. I really do enjoy this CD, and often find it spinnin' in my Diskman. Thanks for reading."
3,Why Oh Why do this?,MH are another band that has become directionless. The hip hop on this disc is silly and was a cover of Message in the Bottle really necessary? It's too bad a band with so much potential got caught up in the trends.
2,what the?,"I am going to put this in my CD player. Switch it to track 2.Alright this riff is cool. Oh yea, now they're jammin! So far thisis cool! But huh? What's this! Is this Rob Flynn rapping! Switch it! This is a major downfall. Burn my Eyes was classic but now I guess we can consider Machine Head a sell out. 2 or 3 songs are good but that's about all you'll find. All the rest is some soft () or some mainstream waste of sound. Die hard Machine Head fans only."
1,What happens to bandwagon jumpers after the trend is dead?,"If this isn't a band totally changing their sound to cash in on a trend, I don't know what is! Machine Head was one of my favorite bands, and now I'm embarrassed to have their poster on my wall. If you are a metal fan, buy the first two cd's. If you're a limp biskit or korn fan, buy this one."
2,Decent and disappointing,First off I saw these jokers open for the great Pantera--and let's just say they can't quite touch the masters yet. Let's face it they began their careers as Pantera clones and now they can't decide what kind of band they want to be. They seem to be emulating Korn--which isn't saying much. The rap on this cd is dumb. People buy the Coal Chamber cd instead. This is directionless.
5,You What!,"These people have no idea what they are talking about. This is by far the greatest album of all time, and a must for any music lovers collection.The fine vocals are perfectly complimented by the amazing guitar riffs, resulting in an amazing cacophony of sound."
2,Way too slickly produced. They've sold out,"If you're looking for nu-metal then this a better album than the majority. I don't like nu-metal much, but of all the stuff I've heard, this is a much better album than most. It's good if you want something heavier and better than all that Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach... But if, like me, you're looking for a sprawling, epic old-skool metal album with guitar leads, longs song structures and double bass kicking then you're in the wrong place. You wanna get Burn My Eyes, Machine Head's debut. They've sold out completely (Sting covers, rap, I think you get the picture), which is a damn shame considering the masterpiece they released in 94. But if it's nu-metal you're after, then this is the right place. But if you've heard Bun My Eyes and you're hungary for more then I recommend Lunar Strain/Subterranean by In Flames or perhaps Valgar Display Of Power by Pantera."
4,SF with an Econmics/Philosophy emphasis,"Written in the golden age of science fiction, and shows it. Nevertheless, it's an interesting story that comes to some surprising conclusions. War has rendered significant portions of Europe either uninhabitable or barbaric. The U.S. Government has failed, to be replaced by organized crime -- Syndic is short for Syndicate. The unusual premise is that a well-run criminal organization is a better government than the one it replaced. If you have a fondness for Heinlein, Ayn Rand, or the Libertarians, you'll like this book."
3,Where to start...,"C.M. Kornbluth was a co-author with Frederik Phol and was also the editor of 'The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction', but before that he also wrote stories. 'The Syndic' is a full length novel of his that he should of done more work on. One problem is he goes through so fast, he gives little in the way of details. He touches on the Mob, the Syndic, a US Government with its capital in Iceland and navel bases in Ireland and England, while also talking about magical witches and psychology all within less than 250 pages. There is little or no background about how the world ended up this way and there is no suggestion that it will get better either!We don't even get a chance to like the characters or really understand the settings or cultures we get to visit. The story is hard to pin down, is it sci-fi or a lecture on politics?I would not suggest this book, unless you know and enjoy the author's work ALREADY."
1,:(,This can safe arrived dented and when you unscrew the top the can is exposed and very sharp. It definately should not be purchased for a child.
3,Not what I would have expected- but worth a listen,"I like to consider myself open-minded and yet I was pretty disappointed with PM's new album. As another fan said,, it lacks melodies. The first song, Things to Remember, was incredible. I was blown away the song was so powerful. But after that, each song started to sound the same- very middle-eastern- Turkish, no doubt. I didn't care for the remakes of Subway and My Last Two Weeks- they lack the clarity and precision of earlier versions. Although I enjoy PM's experimentation, and, would buy this album again, it just misses the soul-gripping quality that I have obsessed over on Cascade and the earlier albums. Cascade spoke to me--- this one lulled me to sleep without stimulating my emotions. I still adore PM- but this wasn't what I had hoped for. Maybe with time it will grow on me."
2,"Oh, how I long for the Peter Murphy of the 80's","Ever since his last full album, Cascade, came out around eight years ago, I have been waiting for the right blend of Peter's vocals combined with the multi-layered instrumentation any of his previous bands(Even the slightly pop-like Hundred Men).With the release of Dust I am still waiting. While a well produced album, anyone that thinks Peter's great vocals mixes seamlessly with this Eastern, exotic blend of music is fooling themselves. Not a total loss, but Dust left me unsatisfied as a long time fan. If your a completionist like me I would still purchase this album. Also if you miss the old ""dark pop/gothic"" like nature of Peter's older stuff, please e-mail me and let me know, there's a Norwegian vocalist whose music you will love out there still recording and I'd be happy to send you some of his stuff."
1,Murphy betrays loyal following with deathly boring release,"In the age of Kaaza and other P2P applications, musicians who betray loyal fans by releasing ""self-serving experimental"" compilations will find that the attempt to make an easy buck is thwarted by consumer's ability to sample the music before buying. Peter Murphy will learn this lesson with his release of Dust (the title conveys its worth). The CD is not interesting or fulfilling in any regard. The tracks are void of Murphy's angelic melodies, and the accompanying music lacks any level of energy or life. The music is dead to a degree that Goth fans will pray for light and life. The music is repetitive and dull. The lyrics lack any creativity or wit. Murphy may be bored with the music his fans love, but his fans will be bored to death by this release. What a shame from such a great artist. Don't buy this album. I'll give you mine."
5,Music to my Ears!,"I love this album! It is completely underrated--I almost didn't buy it. I am a huge Bauhaus fan. I love Bauhaus because of the mood they set, dark and so different plus Peter's incredible voice. I like Peter's solo work, but I think this is one of his best because it is so different from the others. The middle eastern music sets an incredible mood and then you add Peter's voice and I just melt!! I hope he makes another!"
3,Peter's Middle Eastern Experiment,"To start off, if you think this will be a typical Peter Murphy CD it is certainly not. Gone are the flowing melodies with his haunting voice and in are quirky Middle Eastern sounds. All the songs are more that six minutes in length which is not a bad thing but these new songs seem to drag on. You can still hear the definite trademark of Peter's voice and some instrumentation but it seems to get lost in the Middle Eastern theme that runs through every song. If you like that sort of thing then you will love this CD. Me,? I don't particularily love this sound but it is done in a Peter Murphy way which makes it palatable. This is definately a ways away from his previous four studio recordings. It will be interesting what he will come up with next."
1,Disappointed with the book,"I am returning this book because I was disappointed with it. For $50 I was expecting more information than this book has. The publisher's description mentions that there are over 300 pages of information... well, the font is large and the screen shots take up half of a page. The information presented is not much different than you would find with the less expensive guides to quickbooks. And the payroll chapter is worthless, it suggests you might as well outsource your payroll because you might make a mistake!"
4,Headphones,It sounds great. Low bass and crisp highs. Cord Is a fair length. Came with 1/4 adapter so I can use it in my studio and my mixer. They feel a little flimsy tho. Still like them
3,OK for the price.,"I ordered these headphones because I wanted some cheap, small headphones that would be easy to travel with.I'm going to start with the sound first. These being advertised as ""Extra Bass"" is false. These are fairly good with the mids but are terrible with bass and treble.They have a very long cable, and one of my complaints is the volume. If you crank up your music, its still only decent oomph.Conclusion: Probably for young children. The bass is almost non-existent and the volume is very low."
1,Cheaply made and designed,"I bought these thinking I was getting a deal and turns out there made for a kid size head, cheaply made, very easy to break the cord plus cord is only 3 feet long.. Wallmart sells better products"
1,what is that noise?,"Theyre cheap and they suck. Sound quality is pathetic and they sit On (not Over) your ear so that hurts, especially for those of us with piercings. Lame headphones, spare your money."
4,pretty awesome,"i ordered these because i wanted a nice pair of headphones. they came 3 days before they were expected, the sound quality is pretty good for the money your spending on them.only one bad thing about them. they are made out of very thin plastic that looks as if it is going to break.i would def reccomend these to someone"
4,these ear phone are great,"I use these ear phones to play my xbox 360 games, sound is very good, not bad for 15 dollars... would buy again."
3,"Decent for the price, poor build quality for Panasonic","I purchased these to replace some Sony headphones that had snapped, got them at a really good price so I figured that I would give them a shot. The plastic headband feels very cheap, and I feel that this will snap if dropped or mishandled accidentally. Sound quality is decent, but the ear pads are not very comfortable. I use headphones to monitor audio while editing video, and the fact that these have an in-line volume control makes me question how accurate the volume level is. If you're looking for a better pair and don't mind paying a bit more I highly recommend the Sony MDR-NC7 noise canceling headphones, they have a much nicer build quality, and are more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time."
4,good but not great,"I liked these headphones a lot, but the appeal of them isnt great. The soound: good quality but they arent so good with noise cancellation. Either way the product is good, and cheap so i recommend it."
4,"sounds awesome but is fagile, anyways is easy to pack in my bag","im very satisfied i woul buy 30 more if i need it sounds awesome,I watc mivies on my computer and im like in the movie its really good i recomend it buuy it with confident"
3,Average travel headphones,These are very cheap simple travel headphones.The work well for my children. I bought these for my 2 kids to listen to music when we travel and fly. They work for that purpose.They are not the best sound quality but are cheap enough for children to use esp when traveling.
3,Great sound / cheap quality,"I'm really torn. For this price point the sound is really impressive. However, the overall quality of the build is unbelievably cheap. It's like someone was trying to win a contest for the using the smallest amount of material that could possibly stay together to make earphones. If you look at it the wrong way it will probably break.All-in-all I would strongly encourage you to skip these and find an inexpensive set with better build quality. The only possible long-term use for this is if you have it on a nightstand to listen to something and it literally never leaves that nightstand. If you are planning on packing this in a bag and taking it around with you? Forget it. Just grab a 10 dollar bill and light it on fire."
3,ALRIGHT,"Too much treble not enough bass, if your a train/bus person like me then these aren't for you... but if your at home in a quiet room go head then"
2,Couldn't be more fragile if they were made out of glass,"These headphones sound just fine, but the bracket which connects the cups to the headband and allows them to swivel side to side is held into the headband housing via a single tiny plastic catch, which is 100% guaranteed to break if the headphones drop even the tiniest distance. I have dropped mine twice now, the distance from the arm of my chair to the floor (maybe two feet). The first time broke the one one the right, the second the one on the left, broken exactly the same way. Now the headphones still work just fine with both cups duct-taped back into place, but they fit awkwardly since the cups can no longer swivel to fit my head properly. I find it hard to believe someone actually came up with this design without realizing how easily those pieces would break and ruin the product. Extremely poor design."
3,OK for the price. They fold but I wouldn't pack 'em.,"The pictures look nice, but when they are actually in my hand they seem fairly cheap in terms of construction. That's OK, because they were relatively inexpensive, but I certainly wouldn't want to subject them to the duress of my travel. They sit against your ears, which is the style some people prefer, but I prefer a pair that covers the ears. I prefer the Panasonic RP-HTX7 seriesPanasonic RP-HTX7-RS Ryan Sheckler Signature Headphones, which doesn't fold, but does seem more solid and has the added benefit of just a single cord into the earpieces instead of two splitting on the way up. I also prefer the sound of the RP-HTX7. However, the volume control is a nice feature on the RP-HT227 model."
2,They break very easily,"The sound quality of these headphones is good enough, and the volume control on them is a very nice feature. The problem with them is that they break easily. I dropped my pair in the house and the ear piece broke off, the material that holds them together appears to be of very poor quality."
5,Very happy with the headphones,Great little headphones. They are simple and easy to use. They are good quality for 12 dollars . I have prime so it shipped for free. Do not buy these if you want to listen to music. I bought it for watching youtube video and not disturbing my gf when she is sleeping.
2,Bass is nice but the size sucks,the headphones should have been compared with on ear headphones the pics dont do much i thought when i bought these i was getting over th ear dj style headphones dont really care for these if you like on ear headphones than buy these
2,Refund please? Not worth the 18 bucks.,"I am not an audiophile but I know I still want decent headphones.13 year old, Freshman student.Pros:LightFoldsCons:Shorted out as soon as the package was openedMore Expensive than these: http://www.amazon.com/Coby-CV215BLU-Stereo-Headphones-Earphones/dp/B002SSNZW2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327244107&sr;=8-5Traps hair. (not good for long haired people)Uncomfortable earpiecesOther:Overall, the product was not great mostly because the product trapped hair too often."
2,Dissapointing,"The products aren't as good as I thought they would be by the title. When connected to my computer speakers, all volumes at 100%, it is still rather low. I purchased these to replace a set of Coby that didn't have any bass to the sound... Not much difference."
3,lied about the cord length !!!!,"sound is good, but i needed at least a 8 foot cord whereas this one is only 6.6 ft long !! it said the cord was 9.8 which would be plenty, but it isn't !!! i have to move my futon where i listen to music out from the wall to relax while listening !! if you need a long cord, DO NOT BUY,as this will be too short, unless you do what i have to do !!! very disappointed about this."
2,Good headphones but poor wiring,"I've owned two sets of these headphones. The second set was purchased to replace the first one because I liked it so much.Unfortunately the second set is suffering a similar fate as my first set and I must conclude that there is a definite UNDER-ENGINEERING in the design of these headphones.First of all, the sound quality is quite good at this price level and the headphones are comfortable.BUT, the wires connecting to all parts of the unit are thin and poorly protected. My first set suffered an internally disconnected wire in the left headphone. My second set has loose connections in the plug and the wheel volume adjuster. I am constantly having to push on these parts to complete the circuit and properly listen to music.It is a shame. I would have been happy to pay more for better quality."
3,Ok but...,I like the headphones but they make My ears sweat really bad. They do have good sound but needs other or alternate ear pads.
1,9ft cord?,Firstly the product discription is wrong the heafset I received the cord is 6 1/2 not 9 ft long. I bought this because I have thin walls and wanted to hear my tv withough disturbing neighbors. So it was just a buffer vefore I bought a turtke beach headset. Sound is good but the cord causes static right out of the box when moving around... Its what it is and for the price its good to have til you can save for better then pawn off to some kid who doesnt know the diffrence of sound quality headsets
3,Review,"The only problem I have with them is that the cushion is way to hard. Other than that, you pretty much get what you pay for."
4,Exactly what I expected,The product was delivered fast and was packaged nicely. The headphones are sturdy and sound nice. The folding action they have for traveling is very nice and makes them easy to store in small places. They fold small enough that you can even put them in a coat pocket if you want. The only reason I wouldn't give the product 5 stars is because the Bass System is not quite what I expected. The Bass still sounds nice but do not expect any of the kick you would get from headphones that have a Bass system that is powered by a battery. All in all the title is a little misleading but it's still a great product.
2,Sub-par Audio Quality,"Below average sound quality. Most audiophiles will proably call it poor. I'd recommend theSony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcupsinstead. They are of similar build, vastly superior sound quality, and are in the same price range. I went back to my Sony headphones after 2 minutes of listening to this product."
4,good headphones,earbuds dont stay in my ear for what ever reason. so i got these. they were really good headphones until i stepped on them and broke them. so if you dont step on them you should be good.
3,Ok but not what i expected,"i was expecting more bass quality but ive herd way better. but then again i only paid $20, so for the price it is a good deal. another problem was that other reviews made these headphones sound like something theyre not."
2,"Sounds quality is Great, but Extremely uncomfortable","These headphones have great sound quality...if you can tolerate wearing them. The swivel ear cups and adjustable headband sound great in theory, but they don't do anything to make the fit more comfortable. I have a small head and these headphones still seem too tight! The plastic is also really poor quality, so good luck getting them to last more than a month. The ear cushions are thick, but too hard to be comfotable, and don't block any outside noise. I can hear pretty much any outside noise with these on. Not a product I would recommend, but if all you are looking for is sound quality and you don't care about comfort, these might work fine."
3,"Some pros, some cons","ProsVery cheap, affordableaverage sound qualitynice fit, earcup sizeConsconstructioncord lengthwiring?I bought these because I wanted a pair of over the ear headphones. I filtered from cheapest, and I chose these. For a while they worked well, i had no problems. But suddenly, the headphones stopped working well, as if the plug wasnt in all the way. I checked my mp3 player, computer jack, but the problem was coming from the headphones. I don't know whats wrong with them... but as of now I am not using them. I can't return them either, since i dont have the original packaging.Protip: Keep the original packaging just in case!!"
5,After 2 years...,"After 2 years these are still serving me well as headphones for my computer laptop. The pads are good as new; the sound is still clear and deep. I really like having the volume control on the cord, so I don't have to fiddle with the computer to change the sound level. They are light on the head and I wear them for hours without noticing that they are there. They are light, so if you are hard (!) on your headphones, then maybe you might want something more substantial. Sometimes the sounds of the headphones depend a lot on the program they are used on. Some applications require audio enhancers, some merely require setting up the equalizer to where you like it. With a decent frequency range and fairly sturdy speakers, for the average listener, and for the money, these can't be beat."
1,Waste of $$$$,"Literally within 30 seconds of using it was already hot on both ears. I immediately had to stop using as the temperature was increasing by the minute. Furthermore, the picture and description of the item made it appear to cover your entire ear and possibly cancel out noise-- NO NOISE CANCELLATION WHATSOEVER. I can hear all conversations around me and everyone can hear what's coming out of the headphone (So there goes any chance of listening to Glee Soundtracks).A real piece of junk. Then again, I guess that's why they were only 20 bucks. Caveat Emptor."
3,"affordable, and ok","These headphones are pretty much exactly what you pay for. They are good, not great, but the price is accurate. The fit isn't particularly comfortable, but I wear glasses so this is a common problem. Not remarkably fold-able, but more easily transport-able nonetheless."
3,Good headphones,"I got these headphones to use at work, and they are a good pair. Not anything over the top or extraordinary about these, but for the price I am more than satisfied with my purchase. The fold up capability is nice if you are planning to carry them around."
4,Overall a good pair of headphones,"I had found a pair of headphones belonging to my sister that I had really liked using, except they were pretty much not functioning anymore. I decided to buy some over-ear headphones of my own. The sound is good, the volume control on the headphones themselves is nice, the adjustable size is handy, and it even comes with an adapter jack for plugging them into something that has a bigger port than that of an Ipod or a cellphone (I don't know what that something would be, though). The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't actually go over your ear, they go on your ear. They aren't big enough to fit around your ear like the pair my sister had, so they do get uncomfortable after a while. Otherwise, I like them."
2,Good enough for the price you pay,"I just bought this item from Amazon and got to say: they look a lot more quality on the pictures than the real deal! The sound is great and the Extra Bass system is really nice, so for that price is just perfect. But even for my small bald head they are just too uncomfortable for my ears and if you use this o regular desktop computer or laptop the sound volume is to low, but if you have a good PCI or PCIe sound card like I do, YOU JUST WONT stand half of the volume!So pic very well and if you are looking for a bargain and don't mine some negative sides, get this headphones! You won't get regret, I didn't!"
1,These Headphones are worth it. NO BASS!!!!!!,This are cheap and the foam part on the ear sucks. The quality of music sucks too. If you are into music like me then save up a bit more and spend it on a more expensive headphone. It also looks ridiculousness to wear in public.
3,Don't Be Confused,Don't be confused like I was. I bought and read Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War 1929-1945 and thought it great. I then mistakenly thought this entry was a deeper dive into the Second World War but it is actually the latter half of a two volume set dividing the original book. I suggest you purchase the original single volume version as I was more impressed with Kennedy's work on the Great Depression. If interested I reviewed the single volume and awarded it five stars. His work on the Second World War did not compare and that is why this particular work receives three stars.
3,Hard to Review,"It is a bit hard to review this. The book is merely the 2nd half of ""Freedom From Fear."" I truly enjoyed ""Freedom..."" which makes this book awesome, but disappointed because it was not a new history."
5,Feeling Competitive?,"This book rocks. Hours of amusement. Full of fun, useful and useless trivia. I kicked my boyfriend's booty!"
1,Not Uncut - beware,I bought this movie because of a still of the movie that I downloaded recently of Heather Graham sitting on the face of some guy. But when I watched this dvd I noticed to my horror that this particular scene had been edited out. I find this strange as the dvd is R rated.A complete waste of my money and there's nothing I can do about it.
1,Come on!,"OK this movie is SO not-worthy of the hotty-hot-hot Hather Graham. Not only was it pointleass and rather dull, but it seemed to lack in ANY plot whatsoever. Stay away from it like the ebola virus..."
4,Canadian Blu-ray,"I ordered this specifically from this listing, and it made no mention that it would come from a third party. It said shipped and fulfilled by Amazon, and was Prime eligible. But it has a Canadian Home Video sticker on it, with French Canadian subtitles. There are also Spanish subtitles but no Spanish audio track, which feels odd in California. It plays just fine in a US region Blu-ray player, but it seemed suspect when I received it. Just a heads up for the rest of you."
5,Pictures that frozes,"XCLNT picture, good for share with all family members. Thanks to BBC for doing this kind of documental with HD quality. I only wish they could be in 1080 P. and better with spanish and other languajes subtitles, because there is so much other people that would like to enjoy it. But, anyway, I recomend this Bluray documental!"
1,faulty copy received,the copy send to me is faulty so I did not get a chance to see it at all to provide a review and end up have to see it over Discover Channel....
2,expected better,"When I ordered this dvd I was under the impression I was ordering a new dvd. When it arrived, the outer cover was quite worn and it was obvious that this was a previously viewed movie. At 30+ dollars, I certainly expected a new dvd."
4,Great quality as usual,Pro: Great quality as usual.Con: You CAN'T skip the trailers in the beginning on a PS3.Once you've seen all the other BBC planet collections they all start to seem the same though.
4,frozen planet,The first few discs jumped at certain placed and spoiled the viewing a little. I cleaned the disc sereval time but still have the problem. Overall a great dvd and th views are spectacular in blu-ray
3,Half complete,"Ok, I have to admit that I absolutely love the movie, but this soundtrack is incomplete. One song I have been absolutely dying to have on here is the one played at the party in the scene where Joey is modeling by the cans of beer and Bianca turns away, kind of disgusted. Well, the song is called Push It by Salt N Pepa, and they only play the instrumental part on the movie. The song is so worth it. I would reccommend buying a Salt N Pepa cd to get it, or downloading it. Hope this helps anyone who was looking for it."
3,First Song of the movie,"I have I doubt since I read the info about the soundtrack. I'd really like the first song in the movie (when credits appear), even before of ""Bad Reputation"", so I listened all tracks of the soundtrack and I didn't find the name. Does anybody know the name of the song, or the band??"
3,And the Missing Song is:,"The ""Sunshine on My Window. . ."" song is Calypso by Spider Bait.And its an awesome tune.Also the Joan Jett Bad Reputation isn't on there. . .which is too bad."
3,Need help identifying a song,"Hi everybody, What is the song playing when Julia Stiles is sitting down & playing (or holding? I forget) the guitar in the music store and closing her eyes, unaware that Heath Ledger is watching her? Please reply on here or email me if you know what the song title & band is -- thanks!"
3,some songs r kool,"i also think there should be an additional soundtrack, but i dont think it's gonna happen somehow becuz i haf no hope in anything... the movie was okay , but i bought the cd cuz (der) i liked the music better. i didnt kno wut any of the songs were called so i jus bought it thinking it would haf the songs i wanted. however, i was somewhat dissapointed. letters to cleo was okay but sumwut bland and blah blah. i still like it tho bye"
3,I was hooked,"I really liked the movie and knew I just had to buy the soundtrack..I was hooked by all the great music, however I was really disappointed to find a lot of the songs I wanted weren't even on the soundtrack. I really hope they come out with a second cd! Calypso bye spiderbait should have been included! goldfish@mycabin.com"
4,Good music,"I'm not a big music person, but since I saw this movie 7 years ago, I have enjoyed the music, especially those songs sung by Letters to Cleo. Not all of the sings that are in the movie are on this soundtrack, however, and that was disappointing because I enjoyed every song that was left out. But this is a great compilation with a lot of great music, and I recommend it!"
3,Wasn't as good as Movie,It didn't live up to my expectations. I really loved the movie and most of the music but the cd only had one or two really good songs from the movie.
5,soundtracks,Haven't been able to get hold of this for ages and had to have it sent from USA. Didn't take long and completely satisfied with product and it even prompted me to watch the movie again and still loves it.....
3,Please please help!!,I like the cd and all but I just need help with one thing-does anyone know the name of the song that was playing in the background when Patrick was telling Kat what he did during the summer while they were at the prom? You can email me at tsmall@ont.com if you know. THanks.
3,questions,the song when she's on the tire swing is 'your winter' by sister hazel.does anyone know the name of the song when cameron is looking for someone to date kat? it's in the background...the part where 'would you be interested in dating kat stratford?' 'if we were the only two people left on earth...and there were no sheep. are there sheep?' does anyone know what that is?
3,10 Things I Hate About You,"This soundtrack really diapointed me. The movie was a fresh teen flick, with a lot of good punky songs in it. However, the soundtrack countains few of them. There mostly mopey songs that I would only listen to if my grandmother were around."
3,Not what i expected,"when i saw the film i just KNEW that the soundtrack would be good because most of the songs heard on the movie were great. and so would the soundtrack have been if half those songs featured on it. the cd itself was alright but i skipped through most of the songs. thats probably not giving some of the bands a chance though, i love You winter, and even angels fall and the bands letters to cleo and save ferris are really good, and atomic dog is a fun song but i could really care less for the rest of the songs, the other songs are alright but its not as good as i thought it would be, if your thinking of buying it have a listen to it first if possible then decide whether you want it or not, i wish i had!!"
2,Enjoyable Movie,Loved the movie; soundtrack ok. Looking for the name of the 5-second instrumental at Bode's party while Kat is walking thru the house. Anyone know what it is?
5,10 things I hate about you...,"is only good if you're into that kind of thing and if you are, like me than this is a great cd and movie. And if you don't like it than please leave you bad coments to yourself and if you NEED to tell someone 'TELL SOMEONE WHO CARES'!!!!!!!!"
5,check you're facts,"I would just like to say that yes this was a very good sound track and letters to cleo did do a good job covering that awesome song ""I want you to want me"" but i would just like to say as a listener to the RAINCOATS that letters to cleo wasn't pretending to be the raincoats in the movie 10 things i hate about you the raincoats were a female 70-80's band that rocked and the singer of bad reputaion isnt jeff jett my god its joan jett SUCKA GET IT RIGHT whoever posted that pshhh"
2,Many songs not included,"This movie really stinks. But the music is OK, unfortunately, the soundtrack isn't. Why? Because many of the good songs has been left out.Can anyone tell me, what is the name of the male singer, who plays a very interesting guitar, while they have a paint""Ball"" fight in the movie ???"
5,A brilliant mix!,"I loved this CD. The mix was great - a bit of fast, a bit of slow. Yeah, I have a few favourites but I also like all of the other songs too. If you loved the movie, then you'll love the soundtrack!!!"
2,Remember when soundtracks had all the songs you loved from the movie?,"Biggie, Bare Naked Ladies, ""Just Be Good To Me"" were not on this cd. Those and others that were missing were the reasons I wanted it."
4,Haven't had it out of my CD player since I bought it,"Absolutely love this CD, but as a previous reviewer commented, I was a bit disappointed with the exclusion of the song sung by the guy who played Patrick Verona. But all in all, if you like the film, you will adore the CD"
4,I saw the movie and had to buy the CD straight away,"I went to the movies tonight!!! The movie started yesterday in Germany and I am impressed. I loved the movie and I could watch it over and over again!! As I saw the movie I just thought I have to have the CD. The music reminds me of Dawson's creek, grease and anything else I love to hear! HAve Fun"
5,Cute alternative music,"If you are youn and your blood hasn't ceased from running through your veins, then this is a must-listen-to."
4,Love the Soundtrack but where are the missing songs?,"Great soundtrack. It is rare that the music playing on a movie stands out to me, but this one sure did. However, there were a few songs in the movie that aren't listed on the soundtrack and I would like to know what they are as I found the music credits shown at the end of the movie to be pretty illegible. Can anyone please help?"
4,Pretty Good Mix,"I enjoyed both the movie and soundtrack. I'm not much of an Indie Rock or Ska fan, but it was good exposure to a different sound. What frustrated me was some of the other songs I liked were not on the CD... I hope others find what they are looking for."
3,could have been better..,"I agree with those who were disappointed in the lack of certain songs - I would have loved to have 'Too Good to be True' (the Heath Ledger song) on there. But I don't understand you folks who are complaining that you wouldn't have bought it if you had known what was or was not on it. It's called a track listing, people! Read it!"
4,All About It!!!,"I think that this is a pretty good soundtrack, but ONLY for females. I really likes the movie although it had no plot! I think this is a good soundtrack to have because it is by various artists and you get some different tastes. It rock and so do you! Keep on livin'!"
2,Cheap Trick and Nick Lowe do it better,"Letters to Cleo have been making a name for themselves by riding the coat tails of great Bands like The Cars, Cheap Trick and Rockpile...On 10 Things, both ""I Want You To Want Me,"" and ""Cruel To Be Kind"" were much better by the original Bands. So if you like Letters version check out ""Live at Budakhan"" By Cheap Trick and be prepared to be blown away!"
3,"i know it, i know it","i don't know what the original song was, but lauryn hill did a remake of it. i don't know exactly what it's called, either, but i betcha it's something like ""i love you baby"" or ""can't take my eyes offa you"". good luck on finding it. by the way, the cd was okay but i wish there was some poe on there, since kat had poe written on her notebook in the english classroom when she went up to read her poem. and since there was alot of feminist type music on here i thought there might be some poe. you should buy her cd ""hello"". it's awesome"
3,curious?,"does anyone one know what is the what song did the band ""letters to cleo"" played when patrick said he called in a favour to kat in the prom scene right before joey comes in and yells at him"
4,Awesome soundtrack,"Loved the CD, love the movie, does anybody know who sings the song that is playing when Bianca is on the tireswing though?? I'd really be interested. Thanks!"
4,GOOD SOUNDTRAK BUT I HAVE A QUESTION??,"this is a good soundtrak!!! DOES ANY1 KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG IN THE MOVIE RIGHT AFTER KAT TELLS BIANCA THAT HER AND JOEY WENT OUT IN 9TH GRADE, AND THEN KAT IS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT BIANCA IN THE TIRE SWING, IF ANY1 KNOWS THE NAME OF THE SONG PLAYING THEN, EMAIL ME IT @ CLUBBIN523@AOL.COM!!! THANX!!"
3,"Good, but not good enough","I liked both the songs by Letters to Cleo, ('I Want You to Want Me' and 'Cruel to be Kind') and FNT by Semisonic, but I didn't like any of the other songs. And what happened to the rest of the songs? I mean, there was a lot of music in this movie, and they're a lot of music in the movie that's not on this CD."
5,Love'n it!,"The CD is awesome, it is as good as the movie. The CD has a good blend of music that anyone could listen to. I love the movie and even more I love the music."
5,i really really like this cd,"I love the movie, i like the cd also,I like this movie because the scene is in SEATTLE, but I was dissappointed because I just bought this cd yesterday for $14.99 at amazon.com and today I found out that this cd is 2 dollars cheaper.............. :("
3,"The CD is okay, but not the best.","The CD defiantly has some excellent songs on it, but it was not what I expected. My favorite songs from the movie were not included on the soundtrack. (I like the reputation song at the beginning and the song about sunshine on the window.) Perhaps the company should consider a second volume for the film. The CD has some songs that I enjoy; the two by Letters to Cleo, ""Even Angels Fall"", and ""FNT."" However, I think that ""Atomic Dog"" and ""Saturday Night"" should have been left off the CD; they do not flow well with the rest of the CD and undermine the tone of the film. If you enjoyed ""10 Things I Hate About You"" the soundtrack is a wise investment, but it is not as enjoyable as the movie."
4,Great soundtrack,"I liked this movie, and how could I not with Heath Ledger as part of the cast. I also liked the music. The two covers ""I want you to want me"" and ""Cruel to be Kind"" are not quite well by Letters to Cleo. This is an unusual soundtrack in that all the songs on here were in the movie. There weren't any ""extras"" and there were not any deleted either. I keep this one in my car, its very upbeat and matches the fun of the movie. I also like the ballads ""your winter"" by sister hazel as well as ""even angels fall"" and ""the weakness in me."" If you like the movie, you will like the soundtrack. No disappointments here."
5,This is one of the best soundtracks I've ever owned.,"The album gets off to an *excellent* start with Letters To Cleo, Semisonic, Save Ferris, Sister Hazel, and Jessica Riddle. It takes a serious nosedive in the middle, though, with a group of artists that are either unknown or second-rate. Later on, ""Wings of a Dove"" will grow on you, and then we're back with the Cleo's cover of ""Cruel To Be Kind,"" arguably the best song from the movie. The soundtrack to ""10 Things I Hate About You"" will instantly become a favorite in your collection."
4,Pretty good,"Overall, this cd is good. It's missing a few good songs from the film, but that doesn't make this soundtrack bad. It has some very cool upbeat songs like 'I Want You To Want Me' by Letters To Cleo(my favorite song.) It also has 'New World' by LeRoy, 'FNT' by Semisonic, and 'Wings Of A Dove' by Madness. It's a cd I'd recommend. It's worth a listen."
5,Almost as wonderful as the movie!,"I love this music on this soundtrack. It has romance, pop, dance, etc. It brings back great moments from the movie. My favorite song is ""All the Weakness in Me"" by Joan Armatrading and ""Cruel to Be Kind"", Letters to Cleo. The only thing I miss is the song LOC sings in Club Skunk in the movie. Does anybody know what song that is? I want it so badly!"
5,very very good,I really like this cd b/c it used bands that were not really know that well. THe only thing is they should have put that song that Patrick sings to Kat on there too! if anyone knows the name of this song please tell me! thanks!
3,Where did all the music go?,"There was ALOT of good music in the movie that was NOT featured in the soundtrack, like ""The Bell Jar"" which i had hoped would be on there, or the song in the begining of the movie where Kat has her radio on. The first five songs of this soundtrack are fabuluous. I have aquired a taste for ska (Save Ferris) through this CD, and Letters to Cleo is great as well. But i am very dissapointed with the lack of music that was in the movie that was not featured on the soundtrack."
4,ABSOLUTELY RAD! but what about the rest of the songs....,"It's a terrific soundtrack!! I LOVE IT!! But what happened to the other songs from the movie.. Like ""One Week""-Barenaked Ladies, and others...all I can say is i hope they make a volume 2 or something!!"
5,a great variety with a few really good songs,"Even with a few bad songs in the middle, this is still a great cd! Letters to Cleo has a few songs and are now one of my favorite bands (I Want You To Want Me and Cruel To Be Kind), and FNT by Semisonic is another awesome song. Most of the cd is easy to sing along to as well. The middle songs (Atomic Dog, etc.) didn't fit in and I personally didn't like, but the rest makes up for them!"
3,Surprisingly good music,"I saw the movie. I liked it. I heard the soundtrack, and it surprised me. There are some good tracks there, like the ones from Letters To Cleo. The one that strikes me the most is ""Even Angels Fall"". I'm going through a tough time, and I must say that song is pretty inspirational. If you have a little extra cash to spare, get this CD. You'll have fun with it."
3,MONKEY,"i just want to say, where is sprung monkey? what is up with all the cool songs from a movie not making the soundtrack? i liked this movie and the soundtrack was pretty good too but it could be so much more! stop leaving songs from the movie off the soundtrack cause if it keeps happening, what is the point of a soundtrack? SPRUNG MONKEY RULES."
2,Not even close to the quality of the movie,"My main question, considering that there were quite a few good songs on the movie that SHOULD have been included on the soundtrack, but WEREN'T, is WHY? ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, but they weren't able to carry over the quality of the movie to the soundtrack at all. There are several songs on here I can't stand at all, and none I really love, despite having 2 bands I like listed (The Cardigans and Semisonic, who do give decent but not great contributions). The *Letters to Cleo* songs are okay but pretty shallow, and you can hear them in almost their entirity on the movie anyway, ditto on ""I Know"" by Save Ferris... ""Even Angels Fall"" and ""The Weakness in Me"" are the only other songs on this album worth much notice."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking forward to hearing some of the awesome tracks played during the movie, like Kat's dance theme, unfortunately all have been left out and the only good music are the one or two tracks by Letters to Cleo. I was truly disappointed and didn't find any of the other tracks to be a great find."
4,Pretty good.,"I loved the movie ""1O Things I Hate About You"" so with out even thinking twice I went out and bought the soundtrack.I wasn't dissapointed,I was pleased with the cd.I would have liked it better if they would have put in the Smash Mouth song,but that's no biggie.My favorite song is entitled ""Even Angels Fall"" by Jessica Riddle.My second favorite song is by Letters to Cleo,entitled ""I want you to want me"".I like Cheap Trick's version better but this remake will do.The song I really don't care for is by George Clinton,""Atomic dog"",it's just a dumb song.But overall I do not regret this purchase,and I asure you that you won't regret it either."
3,An emotive movie,Triumph of the Spirit shows a good part of the unknown history of many people who wes captive in the Concentration Camp for the eastern and balcanic Europe. Once again Willen Dafoe develope an excellent performance in the company of a very good Latin actor Edward James Olmos.
2,"[Two-and-a-half stars out of four] Nice emotional story, but more fiction than truth here","The real Salamo Arouch story in REAL life,not the Hollyweird version is quite a bitdifferent. There were no boxing mathces atAuschwitz, but there were two Olympic sizedpools [See Swedish jewish Revisionist DitliebFelderer's writings, his parents were inter-ned there for four months in 1943...]. Arouch,from Greece was deported to Auschwitz, the pol-ish camp and all of his family died there oftyphus, not the phoney non-existent 'gas cham-bers' we've heard allllll ABOUT (AD NUSEUM) FORdecades. It's sad those things happened, butthat doesn't mean we're all required to believejewish miracle stories just because James Olmosand Willem Dafoe star in movies about them! CaveatEmptor!"
4,Quiet Vibrations,"Wow! I get pretty cynical over this whole indie rock thing...that is, until I hear the actual music again. KM create a soft-volume masterpiece, one that pulls you in with chrystalline harmonies and stretches the imagination with pretty soundscapes. This outdoes their debut by a longshot, which I feel had great sounds but not great songs. Now, they've got the whole pop thing, and if you're willing to give these guys a good listen, you'll find that there is a great deal of intensity underscoring compositions."
5,The Strength of the Korean Spirit!,This wonderful book reveals the strength of the Koreans under brutal and often savage repression at the hands of the Japanese. It is an inspiration and should be read by all who cherish freedom and justice.
3,Weekends was a party...........- you were not.,"Although "" You were a party "" is a great track- I have to admit this album didn't stand up like Weekends of Sound.. for me. Weekends was my first purchase of 764-Hero. I do think this is a good album from a GREAT band. - Maybe that is why there is a little disappointment..still a fan."
5,doomed good,"(Disclosure. reviewer was born in 1942 and has read this several times since 1970 or so, although not since '99)A's thesis is sound: Axis had to win or be well on way by close of '42. they failed and tide was turning in East, Pacific, and N. Africa.Although essentially a military history with due attention to generals and leaders, this book gives sense of what was going on: who was singing at the Met, playing football, best sellers, etc., as well as the joys and struggles of people at home, how they coped. most of that is in U.S. A. also gives, while describing a campaign, the experiences of the rank and file. He knows what anecdotes and vignettes to select.From this one book readers can follow the year in order, seeing its highs and lows and mundane challenges. Few books give one the sense of ""what it was like."""
5,Audio version of Teach yourself Gaelic (Robertson!),"These tapes ARE the welcome companion to the print ed. _Teach Yourself Gaelic_ (by Robertson & Taylor, c1993, 2003,) with the same ""heather"" cover. Becasue most Scottish Gaelic texts don't give a hint to the pronunciation, which does not resemble the spelling of the words, the tapes are a must.(I believe there is an error above. This is NOT by Roderick Mackinnon in this iteration & not a companion to Gaelic, by Roderick Mackinnon.)Caveat: Both books _Teach yourself Gaelic_ by Robertson & Taylor, & _Gaelic_ by Roderick Mackinnon are Scottish Gaidhlig (not Irish Gaeilge.) Also Mackinnon does include pronunciation guide for each of the vocabulary words."
5,"Turn it ""ON"" and leave it ""ON""","Imperial Teen have not abandoned their boy-girl harmonies exhibited in their two previous efforts instead, as ""ON"" proves, they have grown stronger as a band. Each track is so memborable and infectuous that you'll be tapping your feet even after the CD ends. ""Million $ Man"" in particular, is the kind of song you crank up while your driving 100 mph down the road. But the fun doesn't end there. ""Baby,"" ""Ivanka,"" ""Teacher's Pet,"" ...heck all of 'em are great songs, making the CD as a whole, an excellent find and an essential purchase."
4,Get On It,"What I love about Imperial Teen is their ornery playfulness. Where on their debut they were in-your-face provocateurs, with On this intergender group are giddy seducers barely containing their enthusiasm. These 12 tracks pass at a clip with goofy handclaps and sing-along choruses abounding (though fat chance any of them will get on the radio). They seem slight at first, fizzy like the lightest champagne, but with a kick. ""Baby"" might be a love song to a dog or God. ""Sugar"" invokes the secret thrill of interracial love. ""My Spy"" flirts with bisexuality. ""Our Time"" celebrates the sexual liberation manifest not only in San Francisco, where Imperial Teen live and play, but in the cities and suburbs where the band reaches their small yet passionate audience of fellow hedonists."
3,Forgotten musical score,"This was a rare find of a forgotten score by the composer ofBatboy, Legally Blonde and Sarah Tall and Plain. It's been out of print and unavailable for years. I accidentally found it and feel it deserves to be listened to. It is a beautiful score in places and well above the quality of most of today's musicals. Unfairly criticized and worth a listen if you can find it. It is was released in the UK not in the US.It is well worth the search."
5,I love it so much!,We like all of the outfits. Its fun to read on kindle fire. I will try some more Olivia soon.
5,The Olivia book,"This is a truly novel, fun children's book. It is creative and the character of the pig is well depicted. The accompanying sketches are also delightful. Highly recommended!"
3,Newer Olivia books are better,"I know this is the classic, and before the Nick Jr cartoon, but my 2 year old (and I, honestly) like the newer ""Good Night Olivia"", and ""Olivia Acts Out"" series better - so big and colorful. When I ask my daughter which olivia book she wants to read, this Olivia classic board book or her Good Night Olivia book, she 100% of the time wants to read the Good Night Olivia book."
3,"For all the hype, I found it a bit disappointing...","During the Christmas 2000 season, this book literally flew off the shelves. Somewhere in that time, I actually took the time to read it, and even used it for a story hour at least once.The illustrations are eye-catching partly because they are sparse, but they are also really cute. The characterization of Olivia is really cute.. She's a typical 4 year old, getting into just about everything, boundless energy, and wearing her parents out.It is on this last point that I found some exception with this book. I feel that the book ends on somewhat of a weird tone, that being with Olivia and her parents exchanging good-night ""I love you anyway""s. I think it was meant to be cute, what with Olivia being a rambunctious pig and all, but it seemed to me to bring into the picture the fear that parents, especially, can choose not to love their kids sometimes."
3,LOVE IT!!,I believe this book is intended for 6+ but my 3 year old absolutely loves this book. Bedtime isn't complete without at less 1 olivia book.
4,Amazon Customer Service Alert,"I think I have the wrong window. I LOVE Olivia, only not in Spanish. I would like an English copy, if possible. b"
3,Big deal,"I don't see what the big deal about this book is. I found it to be a highly contrived story of a little girl who gets into a little bit of mischief. The girl, of course, takes on the appearance of a pig. The drawings are cute, and in my opinion served to show elementary kids that they can draw as well as a professional illustrator.The story line was lacking and the organization of the text on the page could be confusing at times. Still, I found it to be cute enough that children would enjoy it as a read-aloud, but I still can't understand why it has achieved so much notoriety.Why 3 stars?:While it is a cute book, the story isn't very engaging. The illustrations are simple (which I like) and do not distract from the story, though they don't add a great amount either. I haven't found it to be greatly received by schoolchildren when I have read it and seen it used in classrooms. Unless you are a serious children's book collector - I would pass this one up - the hype is bigger than the type."
5,Olivia is great!,This is a great book. Very funny! Olivia is one-of-a-kind. The illustrations are what really make this book. I remember showing this book to a friend of mine (...)and we both laughed until we cried. Ian Falconer has given us a great book and a great character. I look forward to many many more adventures of Olivia.
4,"It's Active, Energetic Olivia","Who's Olivia? Olivia is a pig, a rather active pig who is good at wearing everyone out, including herself. The simple illustrations consist of black, white and red and dominate the text of 319 words. In addition to building a sand skyscraper, Olivia feels the need to try on every piece of clothing she owns when she gets changed. During one of her visits to the museum, she views two pieces of art in particular. She tells her mother that she could do one of the pieces in five minutes. After her visit, she goes home and attempts her own rendition of Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm #30 and makes a mess in the process. At bedtime, she bargains with her mother to read five books and they agree upon reading three books together."
2,We didn't need this book...,"Okay, with a family of 7 (3 hyperactive) we just didn't need this book. This energetic/lively little pig was more than what we considered necessary. Although perhaps an impetus for sluggish children, this animal is not the best role model. The book truthfully, bores me. My kids don't choose it and we really didn't enjoy it -- even the first time. Sorry Olivia. And you're such a cute little pig."
3,Olivia by Ian Falconer,"Olivia lives with her mom, dad, her brother Ian, her dog Perry and her cat Edwin. Olivia likes to stay busy. She likes to scare her brother. On sunny days, Olivia likes to go to the beach and make sand castles. On rainy days, she likes to go to the museum and look at her favorite picture. Then she looks at another painting and says, ""I can do that in five minutes."" When she goes home, she tries to do it. She got ready for bed. Olivia asks her mom to read five books. They agreed to read three books. The story ends with Olivia and her mom telling each other they love each other. I did not like this book because I thought it wasn't nice for Olivia to draw on the walls. I would not recommend this book to other kids because it wasn't funny to do that."
1,Absolutely the Worst Book for a Toddler,"I know everybody loves this book, I cannot imagine why. It is terrible. Why would I want to put the following ideas into my stubborn two year daughter's head?Scaring her little brother is OKTrying on everything in the morning to get dressed is OKDrawing on the walls to imitate pictures at a museumAsking for five books at bedtimeMy daughter does not need these ideas put into her head. If I do put these ideas into her head with this book she will learn it is ok to scare younger children, it is ok to try on all your clothes when getting dressed, how to draw on walls, Olivia asks for 5 books so will I. Who is this author? Do they have children and siblings? Do they try to leave the house on time when the children are trying on all their clothes? Do they try to put a child to sleep after just five more books?I don't get the point of this book. Children learn by what they see, read, hear, etc. Why introduce these concepts to a toddler? This book is plain awful."
3,condition of book,"The book I received,""Olivia"". was the one I wanted. I was disappointed that it had a tear in the cover back as this was a gift."
3,The book was a dirty.,"Overall the book was fine, but it was not in ""good"" condition.I was not happy to get a dirty book."
5,Charming,"What the book, Olivia, may arguably lack in plot, it makes up for in charm. Olivia is an energetic, precocious, and adorable little pig. Ian Falconer's illustrations will remind all of us of an Olivia in our lives."
4,Olivia,This book is easy to read and made my daughter very happy that she could read a book about Olivia which is one of her favorite cartoons.
4,Great Board Book,I purchased this book for my 1-year old daughter. Olivia is such a cute little character. The story is simple and my daughter enjoys this book. Recommend to anyone with a young daughter!
5,A delightful visual feast,"It is amazing what a talented artist can do with the most simple aspects of life, when he finds the perfect persona for those actions. This book is a real treat, not only for pre-schoolers but adults as well. This just maybe the best children's book series since Harold and the Purple Crayon, drawing on the ordinary and making it into the extraordinary."
4,Four bright stars and a full moon,"In Olivia, Ian Falconer captures the effervescent spirit of six-year-old Olivia, showing her quirks and charms with deft skill in an amazing display of charcoal sketching accented with vibrant splashes of red. The trio of white, red, and black form a powerful trio of color that capture the confidence and boisterous Olivia's high-energy personality.Mr. Falconer slips in enough surprises- the Jackson Pollock painting and the rather astounding sand castle, for instance-to add more zip to this lively romp. This book is a welcome breath of fresh air to the field of children's literature, where all too often, well, let's just say the books are pretty poorly conceived.The text and story are short and economical, providing just enough details to justify the elaborate, funny illustrations, which are the reason you may every now and then pull out this book for another look even when the children are asleep or out in the treehouse."
5,An heirloom for your grandchildren,"This book is gorgeous. I read this story to my little boy constantly. Given that he is only 4 months old I've had to do a bit of soul searching and admit to myself that it's really me who's hooked on the story of Olivia the charismatic pig.Olivia lives with her mother, her father, her brother, her dog Perry and Edwin, the cat. Every page gives you an insight into the little pig's personality and every page is guaranteed to make you laugh.This book has become my number one ""new arrival"" present. I'm sure that if you want to give someone an heirloom this would be a good place to start. Grab yourself an early edition while you can!"
5,Olivia,"I really enjoyed this book. My 28-year old son recommended it, as he was interested in the artwork and while looking through it was taken by the character and story. He bought it and shared it with me. My sister and brother-in-law read it and told me they thought it was a treasure and now I'm buying it for my 7-year old grandniece. The tale itself is simple and masterful and the illustrations are amazing and carry you through the story. You can't help but wear a smile the entire time you are reading this sweet little book. What fun!"
4,deft but not transcendent,"Visually playful, with arresting illustration and some fun page layout. Olivia's a spirited character for toddler girls--inquisitive, physical, testing limits. But after a few weeks of heavy rotation in our home months ago, we haven't returned to it much. One reason why: the only drama it has is family drama, not larger social drama. It doesn't give much of a picture of how the mysterious wider world works. No other characters have weight besides Olivia. Not enough story in the book to make it a must-have, even for NYC kids like mine."
4,L'Chaim,"The story line and the writing are both outstanding; and Graubart's sense of humor adds something playful to a profound exploration of the human condition and the struggle to make the world (and oneself) a little better. I could not put the book down, and afterwards felt a keen desire to study with its author. Reading this book also energized my thinking about Torah study, though I believe that Planet of the Jews stands nicely on its own as an exciting and well-crafted science fiction story that changes the lense of our world view enough to make the reader think in a new way about some once and future issues."
1,:-(,I never finished the book. It was a sorry disappointment and a bore. Sorry I wasted my money on it.
5,Great buy,"Bought these bottles as a back-up system for my Nigerian Dwarf Goat kids in case there was a problem with Momma. Although I didn't have to use them, they were exactly what I needed for a great price."
2,very poor quality,This is very poor quality even for the price. Ordered it for a donation drive I was doing and felt embarrassed gifting it.
3,Great bottles but...,I was impressed with these bottles and LOVED them! But then the nipples started to get moldy and we were forced to throw them away.
4,smashing,"I really loved this book. I guess it is more aimed at the male reader but i really enjoyed the beautiful English.A classic treasure hunt incredible detailed. The only thing better than this is having it read to you by Alan Rickman, look for the Audiobook with the same title!!"
1,"BUYER BEWARE - NO NOTES, NO DOCUMENTATION","If you expect any notes or historical documentation that these recordings are authentic, look elsewhere. This is the kind of cheap, bare-bones edition that gives Public Domain a bad name."
4,Worthwhile DVD,This is a must have if you are a fan of Warren Haynes. He gives some great insight into his own personal style. Not an instructional dvd for beginners. I highly recommend it!
2,Lacking,"This is a repackaged on DVD version of what used to be a video tape. This may be an OK learning program for experienced guitarists, but beginners should stay away. There is no written material other than a tab book that doesn't tell you how to read tab. Plus, the text in the tab book is almost unreadable. This DVD may have been marginally useful if the tab booklet was adequate, but it is pretty useless with this poor quality booklet. I gave my DVD away to my brother-in-law who is an accomplished guitarist."
3,Great guitar playing but a booklet would be nice,"The warren hayes video is great. You can rewind and pause to get ideas for new licks but it does lack a booklet to read along with. I ordered it for Unbox video.It does have some really good tips, ideas and insights for the beginning blues player."
2,Haggah for vegetarians,"Unfortunately, I found this haggadah to be too pedantic. The philosophical/ethicial reasons for being vegetarian were discussed in a very grim and uncomfortably vivid way. I purchased this for my cousin, who is a 15 year old vegetarian in the hopes that it might help her feel more connected to and included at our Passover Seder. Instead, because I found the haggadah upsetting, I didn't even show it to her. The idea of a vegan/vegetarian Haggadah is a great one, and I hope that when someone else attempts to create another one that they spare us all the descriptions of agribusiness animal torture we are unfortunately already familiar with."
2,Works fine...until it bends,"I had one of these for about a month before it suffered it's first structural failure. It developed a slight bend right where your heel goes...and that got bigger and bigger until it simply folded to a 90 degree angle...So i thought i could pull the handle off and use the other end..Nope...It's not finished the same under the handle, it's sharp.I would recommend a sturdier shoe horn if you are going to put any weight on this thing..."
2,mostly opera,"Don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of opera, but from the reviews of other albums i had gathered that this group combined Trance and Opera. From what we could tell, this is mostly and Opera CD with maybe the slightest changed beat, and not changed in a trance sort of way. It was a good CD, but not what i expected"
3,Helpful Background,"The book is short and provides helpful background for those who are studying the Reformed Creeds. It is an easy read, not overly scholarly, and I would have appreciated a few more details and recognition of sources. Still, it gives the reader a flavor for the background behind the Heidelberg Catechism and Belgic Confession."
1,Shame on me,this is simply a copy of pdfs widely available from the DOE. Search line for doe nuclear physics handbook. Please don't waste your money on this.
4,Recommened viewing,I loved the story. Great lines and an even better cast. The opening scene is worth the whole movie. Dean Cain alone in the black underwear is to die for. Watched it at least 3 times so far and love it every time.
2,Not my type of family movie,I love Dean Caine in most of his movies but this was not a good one for him. Do not recommend children watch this movie. It was too graphic for some part of it and totally disgusting for other ones. Thank you.....
1,no no,I Didn't like it - kind of boring - I don't recommended it - but fast forward helped. Was hoping for a smarter movie...
3,"Compared to Ever After, this isn't a really bad movie","I don't think it's a movie you wanna see if you've watched Ever After. I watched Ever After before Best Men, and I think Ever After was such a great movie. Then I thought Best Men was good too, but I thought wrong. Drew Barrymore appeared after the movie had run a half full. It takes about 80 minutes to watch this and 80 minutes isn't long enough, is it ? Anyway, it's funny a little bit. And it seems to be made up, not naturally funny."
2,Will it EVER end?,Amateurish and plodding. This is one of those movies that keeps you checking your watch.
1,"Stupid, Inane and an Utter Waste","Best Men is probably the worst movie I have seen since Wired. This film (if it can even be called a film..) began horribly and continued to increase in stupidity and tedium. I can't say exactly which scene in particular sums up the contempt I have for this movie (was is the early ""homosexual experience confession"" scene, or the scene where we find out that the police officer in charge of the bank robbery situation is Sean Patrick Flanery's father?), but -believe me- this one's a stinker. (And the only reason I'm giving this movie a star at all is because of Andy Dick's casting.)"
3,"Dean Cain once again plays the ""gay"" character","I'm surprised after the well received TV Series ""Superman"", Dean Cain can now only find roles in B-rated films. More suprisingly is the frequency Dean Cain plays a gay character once again. The movie as a whole was funny at times, but definitely a cable only viewing. Not once does Dean Cain even take off his shirt, which would have added to the character's development and my enjoyment. The idea of the ""son"" quoting Hamlet bored me to death. This movie needed the giant Monty Python foot to squish some characters for a good laugh thus improving the quality and rating of this film."
3,"Drew's in this movie, but barely...","I received this DVD as a gift. The person who bought this knows that I am absolutely NUTS over Drew Barrymore. Even thought Drew is on the cover her actual role in the movie is minor. Her role here is comparable to her role in ""Donnie Darko."" The movie does start off a bit tepid and ends with a punch. Watch and listen carefully for there are some shocking surprises. I will say that the movie is well made and engrossing. However, if you must buy this movie, buy it for the fun of watching it and not for solely for seeing Drew."
2,Not the best.,"To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards. Dean Cain on the other hand looks mighty fine, if you're after a gay man. It's not the type of movie you want your children to watch. Trust me."
1,I would give negative stars if possible.,"Before you think about spending money with onlingo, google the term ""onlingo complaints"". The list will be long and validated.It is rare that I am at a loss of words for a company and product so abysmal but here I sit. Repeat charges on credit cards, a lack of customer service, a product certainly not worth the hassle you will be put through to cancel, return or address the issues that are sure to arise.My husband and I wanted to learn spanish. We have found a better system without any hassle at all.So run while you still can."
4,Big Jim,"Whether you like or dislike Jim Garrison, this book is a great read and a must have for anyone interested in the JFK assassination. Notwithstanding the flaws in his investigation, to this day he is the only person to ever bring a case before a court in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It was a painstaking effort that did not result in Clay Shaw's conviction, but helped open the eyes of the American public to what could have happened that day in Dallas."
1,Tape was ruined - had flaw part way through Tape 1,Just started listening to Tape 1 - about half way through it unwound itself in the tape player. Tried to re-wind it manually but there was a twist in the tape that could not be fixed. Product is ruined. Tried Tape 2 - it wouldn't play at all.Would definitely not order Books on tape again from this seller. Probably not from anyone.
2,dinky,"this pendant is hollow - looks and feels cheap to me. Picture is misleading. In a side view you could see that it's actually pretty thick - but since it's hollow inside it's not very heavy.On a side note, I actually ordered it twice - first order never arrived (probably because I was deployed to Iraq and the APO system does sometimes lose things) so when I got back Stateside I re-ordered it and sent the seller a message saying that the first order never arrived. 2 weeks later and I still have not heard back from them. Then when the second order arrived, I was pretty disappointed to have gone through so much trouble for what turned out to be a dinky little necklace with a cheap chain."
3,ok overall,realized you cant put more than about 100 feet of hose on one line in my garden...if you put more the water pressure drops to nill
1,Not very happy,My iteam is not the right thing and i have noway of returing it or calling anybody this is so stupid im going to call my credit card company and decline my charge or someone needs to call me asap 8609136032. You guys show something and sell something diffrent ripoff.thanksHarry Harjani
2,Okay but won't buy again,"I've had the drive for about a year, use it daily and rely on it to handle file backups between work & home. I have had to reformat it twice since I got it, and now it won't hold its format. Even if I can get it reformatted, I don't feel it is reliable. I plan to buy a new one from a different manufacturer, partly because of the problems I've had with it losing its format (and my data!), but also because the curved shape has been a problem from the start. The shape makes it easy to grasp but it makes it too wide to fit into the USB port area on the front of my desktop PC's. I have to use a cable, which makes it less compact/portable. Generally, I like Lexar products (have used their media readers) but I don't plan to buy a flash drive from them again."
1,Very poor jumpdrive reliability,"My Jumpdrive worked for two weeks then died. I waited two days to get an RMA, paid to return the drive, and waited over two weeks for a new one. It only worked for a week.Lexar refuses to exchange it for a different one, and will only continue to send me the same unreliable product (at my shipping expense). Their quality is far inferior to that of other manufacturers such as PNY."
5,Peter Licastro is reviewing the wrong product,"So perhpas I should as well! I am about to order this this Jumpdrive. I currently have the 128 MB version and LOVE it! The plastic casing is sturdy, the transfer speeds are excellent for an 80x drive and it works fine without the cap. I have been carrying mine around capless in my pocket with a scandisk cruser mini (from work) and my cell phone and have had no problems.After over 2 years I have had no software problems, or reasons to reformat the drive. I'm even using it with the FAT16 preset.If the 1GB version is like the 128MB version, don't pass this up!I will change my review to reflect the 1GB version once I have tried it out.*** UPDATE ***I have been using the 1GB version w/o the cap and it is good as gold! I have no complaints so far!"
5,Instant Yerba,"I like it hot in the morning, and over ice in the afternoon. This is great stuff, not the jittery-jolt as with strong coffee. This is my new great find!"
2,"Mixes well, but tastes funny","The product mixed well in water, definitely had a mate-kick to it, but the stevia sweetener gave a weird taste that killed any mate flavor. The product tasted more like a bad anti-diarrheal medicine rather than mate. I gave away the product to a lady at work from South American who drinks lots of mate and she didn't like the taste, either, so she threw it out.I would rather try a blend of this without the Stevia. If you like stevia maybe you will like this product, otherwise, avoid."
2,Sounds too scary for younger children,My 4 1/2 year old son picked this toy out himself. He was really excited until we got it home and he heard the voice of the mummy. He refuses to play with it and even wanted to take it back to the store because it scared him so much. Definitely not recommended for younger children.
3,I couldn't even get through this book,"After reading ""Catalog Copy That Sizzles"", I had to read this book. I found the chapter on creating and writing descriptions of be long and boring.The rest of the book is a great resource when it comes to creating a catalog, but don't get one book and one author's opinion. Get at least two or three books so you can form your own opinion on how to create your catalog and you can use the tips and techniques of a variety of authors."
2,Copyright is 1985 not 1995,"The content of the book looks ok and all - but - the examples are ridiculously OLD and OUT OF DATE style wise. The copyright of the book is 1985, not 1995. The cell phones, the font, the everything is distractingly 80s. Maybe the content is still good, but I never would have bought it if I had known that this book is over 10 years old."
2,did not have the original strength I was looking for,"I bought a 15 count box initially and it was perfect. the 100m count box is somehow light, and not giving the original taste."
1,Two Leaves and Blah,"I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea. I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try. I have to say I am totally disappointed.No real flavor what so ever. I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing. The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful. Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me, the taste did not.I would never recommend this tea to anyone, and as for me I'm sticking with Tazo."
5,Enjoyable and refreshing,"I am not a famous person or an athlete but I am a mom and I have to say I really enjoyed this book. The stories from other mothers were catchy and full of information. It gives me ideas of how to juggle a busy lifestyle and being a mom. It made me feel like I am not alone in my struggles and made me laugh at the same time. I would recommend this book to anyone who is already a mother, pregnant, or thinking about having children. It gives many tips on how to stay healthy throughout pregnancy and afterwards."
5,A Must have for EVERY mother,"I recently gave birth to my second child and could not wait to get my hands on this book. Alexandra Powe Allred was very candid and open about herself and so many others in or out of the public eye. I will never be as famous as any of the women in this book, but it is nice to know there are others out there that struggle with the same issues I do, most importantly continuing to incorporate fitness into my daily routine while still doing the most important job in the world, being a mom. One more thing, reading this book really made me proud to be a mom at a time when I didn't feel up to the task."
5,The insightful essays and witty observations are sure to perk a smile among travelers and mothers alike,"Sunny Daze: The Humorous Misadventures of a Tropical Island Mom is the true, humorously reflective memoir of a mother who moved to the Bahamas in the early 90's and learned the hard way that life on a stunningly beautiful 21- mile long island isn't all surf and sunshine. The insightful essays and witty observations are sure to perk a smile among travelers and mothers alike, as the author reveals the other side of living in the Bahamas - sluggish mail service, cockroach invasions, fresh milk shortages, and of course the all too familiar parenting challenges such as homework help, summer camp selection, and airline travel. Each vignette is brief making Sunny Daze perfect for light or on-the-go reading, but taken as a whole, Sunny Daze is certain to bring a smile."
2,YAWN. This is a sleeper.,"WOW! I was really excited when I heard this record was out! I'm a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, and also a fan of bluegrass music.... I figured this would be a PERFECT combination, so I bought it ASAP. And really, it's not horrible, it's just dull. This sounds like a bunch of session musicians playing for scale, no heart, no passion. Nothing interesting or unique about the arrangements. To borrow from Skynyrd's album title, this is Nothin' Fancy. It makes ok background music, plesant enough to play in our retail store.... THAT's disappointing in itself."
3,"Good book, but not for hunters","I bought this book based on some reviews elsewhere that said it was a great resource for someone going goat hunting. While it is a good book about their environment, social behavior, etc, it really doesn't have much useful info for someone that is looking to go on a goat hunt. However, I see this as being the fault of the reviews I had read, not the book since it was not advertised as a hunting book on Amazon."
4,Deep Dish help EBTG achieve success,"Everything But the Girl to me is one of the most underachieving bands of the 90's. That's mainly because Tracy Thorne has one of the greatest voices you'll ever find, but the music rarely lives up to her capabilities. Thankfully, through collaborations (such as ""Protection"" by Massive Attack) and remixers we get to see her talent shine through occasionally.Here she handed her song to Washington house producers Deep Dish, who worked wonders on the track. Of course, you know that or you wouldn't be looking to buy the single. So what do you get? A radio edit, an excellent classy disco remix by David Morales, and the original 9:30 version.It's not a great value, 2 songs + radio edit, and you can pay about as much and get the track on Deep Dish's ""Junk Science"" or the new Everything But the Girl cd. But considering ""Junk Science"" can be hit and miss, and the EBTG album has received spotty reviews, you may be better off with the sure thing."
1,Picture and description are not for model #403604,"the picture and product description is not for unit model # 403604. Received package today and found that it is vented only, cannot be used for non-ducted purposes."
4,High end Low price,I was looking for a new hood vent for my rental and after shopping Lowes and Home depot I found this unit at a much lower price.Easy installation and I was surprised how quiet the fan was.I highly recommend this product.
1,Poor packaging,"This is my second one. The first I returned because of a prominent dent in the front. I sent it back and got a refund. I ordered another unit and it came with a smaller, less visible dent, and I decided to keep it. Both range hoods came in flimsy factory cartons with small pieces of fitted foam inserts. The foam was badly broken in both shipments and the boxes had external damage. I don't recommend this purchase."
3,Very inexpensive. You get what you pay for.,"This is basic. One light, On or Off for fan and light. Very flimsy screen filter. If you want a cheap stainless fan hood, this is the one for you."
3,Looks Great !,"This stove top hood looks great,the price was right, and the delivery was on time. However, since we're currently remodeling our kitchen, we have yet to install it so I can't comment yet as to its performance. Installation of new kitchen cabinets should be completed by mid-December, at which time the stove top hood will also be installed."
1,What Horrible Service,"I have no idea how the hood functions because it arrived so damaged. Listen to all of the above comments on the condition of items received from this company, they are very TRUE!! I took a chance even though I read the reviews and probably got the hood that someone else described above. Banged and dented and scratched. Delivery box was so flimsy and hood was packed terribly. AND... you could tell that it had been sent somewhere else first. It had another packing slip in it from 2 months before I ordered ours. Don't purchase from these people. To be fair, I did return it without any problem but I had to return it and that was problem enough and I was stuck with a hood filter from a different vender that would not take it back w/o me paying shipping because there was no problem with the filter. But what do i need that filter for now? To ship the filter back was more than the filter cost."
5,Broan - a keeper,This range hood arrived in perfect condition and installed easily. It is for a rental property; but I would have no objections to putting it into my own home.
1,Damaged,"The range hood was reasonabled priced, and the shipping was free. When I found it on our front porch, I knew it would be damaged ,only a tank could have survived being shipped in the retail box. I had to ship it back @ $5.00 more than what was credited to me ,Probably all the tape I used to hold the box together. Initially when I called I spoke with a woman her middle eastern accent was so strong, I had to keep asking her to repeat what she was saying.Her message was to keep it & theyll send me a new one. Later I recieved a e mail asking to ship it back for a replacement. IT has only been a week since I returned it."
2,"Broan 36"" four way convertible under cabinet range hood, black.","Broan range hood was ordered on June 29, 2008 and received on July 3, 2008. Item was crushed in one corner, maybe dropped during shipping...I had to wait for return label and send item back. I re-ordered same item and second item was received in good condition. I am happy with item but was greatly inconvenienced by the return. I love the black color!"
1,Dented in box,My daughter bought a house and we did not get around to hanging the hood fan until today. We were sick when we took it out of the box and found out it is dented right in the front of the hood. The box was not damaged so it had to have happened in the factory. Because we did not inspect the product as soon as it arrived and we are beyond our return time limit I guess we are stuck with a $63.00 dented hood fan. We trusted that because the original box was in perfect shape the product would be perfect as well. This is very disappointing.
2,Check locally before buying this,"The Good: It is inexpensive, easy to install, works reasonably ok, packaging was decent- arrived without incident in a few daysThe Bad: Loud, very very loud. You won't be able to handle the fan noise on high, even on quiet it is louder than the one it replaced (which oddly had a higher noise decibel rating for the fan). The front plastic vent cover is ugly and lets some air through, but it is not a deal breaker.If you can wait a couple of weeks and need a low-end, inexpensive range hood, I would check your local Home Depot for the lower-end Maytags (they usually have to order them), they run about the same price as this but are of much better quality and lower noise. We needed one immediately and this did the job, barely."
4,"It Does The Job, Stainless Finish Looks Nice, But A Bit Flimsy","This Range Hood does the job. I bought it to replace my old one that have seen better days.The stainless steel finish compliments my stanless stove and fridge nicely. The exhaust fan has decent draw and prevent the house from smoking up when you fry something.However, some of the craftmanships are flimsy. These includes switches and the way the filter is mounted, I also wish the enclosed the light bulb a bit more to avoid grease sticking to the bulb."
4,Great value,"Whatever your reason is for taking a long, hard look at the cheapest of range hoods, buy this with confidence. This was a perfect, and attractive replacement for a 20 year old range hood. My local Home Depot didn't even carry 36"" wide, much less offer a range of options. You will need to buy and wire in a plug, and provide some duct tape to seal to your existing duct, but this thing was a slam dunk. Having read the other reviews about how light weight the sheet metal is, I got a good chuckle out of a message on the box, warning me not to pull it out of the box by grabbing the middle of the front edge. Treat it gently at install, and you'll be rewarded with a dirt-cheap but perfectly functional stainless steel hood."
5,Great Buy,"I am delighted with this product. The price was very reasonable, it looks great and it was not difficult to install. The fan runs so quietly I did not even hear the fan when it was switched to the on position.I would recommend this product to a friend."
4,Beautiful Hood,"Beautiful product that works perfectly.There is only one bad thing I can say - The stainless steel is thin, and kind of flimbsy when installing. I think the stainless steel could have been thicker and a higher quality.Once its installed you can't tell though."
3,Easy to install but fan can be a bit stronger,"If you measured your range hood dimensions correctly, this model will fit perfectly. Installation is simple and despite it's moderate price, offers many exhaust fit options on the unit cutouts. The build quality is ok considering the price. The fan is small and can be a bit more powerful but again, expected in this price range. All in all, I think this model is fair given it's price range and I am happy with the purchase. It is fairly light in comparison with the unit it is replacing so even one person can install it with a bit of elbow grease."
2,A disappointment,"That was my first book of Oz and probably my last one. The story is nice and interesting but the characters are problematic. Oz's heroes are not normal people, they act and speak weird which makes it impossible to identify with them. It's like reading about aliens, not human beings. The author fails to give the feeling of a human story, human thoughts, emotions and words. I've discussed this with others who have read it and they totally agreed."
4,A bit too perfectly peaceful,"Great imagery, but pedantic at times. Interesting insight into Israeli culture but the characters seem too often like caricatures. The pace is very slow overall, and the book reads more like a documentary than like literature."
3,Lots of Information!,This book has lots of great information and does a good job with mark's. I would like to see more color pictures. If you are selling a book on colored jewelry it makes sense to have pictures that show the colors! Otherwise is a good reference book.
5,Practical and informative,Here is a great handbook to help parents. This book is packed full of great examples and hands on help. Ever Parents should read Rainbows for Rosie.
5,"Full Moon: O Sagashite, Vol 1","This book was one of the most saddest stories I have ever read! It is about a 12 year girl with a growing tumor in her throat who loves singing but the tumor stops her. Her childhood boyfriend from her orphanage promised that they would meet again, even though he moved to America and she stayed in Japan. Mitsuki is about to sneak out for an audition when 2 harbingers of Death come to tell her that she only has 1 year left to live. So one of the harbingers grants her a wish; to turn her into a 16 year old girl since the audition only allows people 16 and up to enter. Arina Tanemura again amazed me with another series, though Sakura Hime was also pretty good, too."
2,Not alright,"This disc is not so hot. The singers' voice is not 'gravelly', but rather fairly annoying, with endless repetition the seeming ultimate goal. Our maximalist hero, alas, pushes the boundaries in some very previously-explored directions. People were ready to follow Luke Slater off the edge of the earth before this disc came out. Who knows what is next for the guy.There are some tracks that are not THAT bad, but tracks like Only You and Stars and Heroes can be instantly deleted from your hard drive if you rip this disc. There are several tracks that would be good if you could delete the voice over. It's like Slater creates this wall of sound and bass in your room (e.g. Searchin for a Dream), and this guy walks in and starts mumbling next to your head. No offense Mr. Slater, but it just doesn't work.This thing is going for one U.S. penny on the used listings. Let that be a review in itself."
2,God Bless Bret's Greedy Little Soul and Washboard Abs,"As a long time Poison fan, this two-star rating pains me. Especially since one of the stars is for the amount of time Bret spent with his shirt off. Very nice. Anyway, the other star is for the somewhat interesting story. With the amount of time it took Bret to finish this movie (I remember hearing about it back in the late 80's), you'd think he would have done a minimal amount of legal research? A lot of this is just poorly researched nonsense. Like a story written by a kid in junior high who has no access to books or the internet, and just imagines what it must be like to be on death row. The movie attempts a Big Twist! at the end, but really didn't make any sense. I managed to watch it all the way through, so I guess it wasn't that bad. Except for the Sheens, the acting is just as bad as you suspect."
1,DVD would not play,"We recieved this DVD in time for Christmas but when we tried to view it, we got an error message. I returned the DVD per the instructions we received and to this day have still not received a replacement as we requested. Very poor customer service. I wonder if we will ever get a replacement."
3,Great Potential......but,"This was definitely a ""B"" movie. Micheals should have sold the screenplay to someone who knew how to make a movie. The plot was great, I thought it was suspenseful and well written. However most of the acting and production was deplorable. Question: was Michael's girlfriend a stripper before she hooked up with him? Because the only convincing part of her performance was while she was on stage. Overall this is worth watching, but I highly recommend you rent it or buy it used, it is not something you will want to watch over and over."
5,Good solution,"I installed two of these. Both work very well. Installation does have to be done carefully, and it probably wouldn't seal well against an uneven surface."
4,it works!,This sweep works very well but it requires very careful and precise installation especially when your door bottom isn't level and swings over uneven tile like ours. It works when door bottoms don't as in our case.
4,Fixed our draft problem,This unique design was exactly what we needed for a door that rested over a threshold that rested below the floor level. The installation took about 20 minutes and the house is already experiencing the difference. The strip itself is solid and great workmanship. I recommend this product if you're looking for a tight seal on the bottom of a door.
4,How to build branding,"If you want do develop a brand name, this is the right book. It presents an overall process on how to buid a branding."
2,bad for a new book,the book cover was all scratches ....some pages inside were teared off.... too bad for a new book
5,People First,"Jack Lannom understands human nature and teaches others in this easy to read, easy to understand book about leadership and relationships."
5,Creating a Purpose-Driven Organization,"I found this book to be a very quick read, highly motivational, and full of techniques to help individuals achieve their highest potential. This is a MUST READ for leader's at every level of an organization. In fact, it has had a profound impact on our leadership team. Inspired by Jack Lannom's philosophy of ""People First"", our leadership team is redefining our organizational culture. We are redefining our vocabulary to identify our staff, not as ""our people"" but to refer to them as our ""purpose partners."" We are embracing the concept that every human being needs to know that they are needed; that who they are and what they do in our organization, has purpose, meaning and immense significance."
5,"Truth, Wisdom and Excellence","Yes! Thank you, I need you, I believe in you, and I am proud of you Jack Lannom! What an amazing message that I will deliver to all my friends and family, as well as business associates.Jack Lannom is the Lighthouse Beacon that shines so clearly for the tired and torn vessels of life's turbulant goings. The People First series is the fleet of tugboats that have come to rescue you and bring you back to shore.Byron StowellWELLNESS INTERNATIONAL"
1,Really bad,This book reads like a bad after school special. I've read better from 7th graders. It was almost like the author had a story and tried to shove in his own selling points in all over the book just to make it relate. But the whole thing was a train wreck. It gives very generalized buzz words but very little substance to actually go on. Wouldn't recommend to anyone for any reason.
5,Incredible book,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Easy to read, great flow and tons of wisdom! I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one!"
5,Gorgeous....,"This a sparkling and lovely album filled with tiny sparks of pure bliss...slightly less streetwise than their masterful ""Penthouse"", but just as terrific...I think this is their most focused and fully-realized album...every track is a warm fuzzy gem...""Romantica"" is my first choice for a dreamy mood from the most incandescent of indie bands."
2,The Worst Yet,"I have been a long time Luna fan and listen to every cd routinely. I am tired of reading reviews written by fans that say that the last two studio albums are great or that long time fans should just get over the Penthouse or Bewitched albums and accept that their sound is evolving. I believe their music has done just the opposite. It has regressed from a melodic guitar band with an edgy sound and clever lyrics into dopey melodies and dopey lyrics.I own a company that employs several 23-28 year olds and several part time people in the same age group. We have an extensive cd collection in the office. Interestingly, new listeners to Luna put on the Bewitched cd and sometimes Penthouse and never Pup Tent or Days of Our Nights. Romantica is just not on their play list at all.With the exception of a song or two from each of the last three albums, Luna has not recorded a good album since Penthouse."
2,In Love,"On their sixth studio album, Romantica, Luna's Dean Wareham is in love, but I'm not sure with whom or with what. Certainly he adores the post-Velvets drone of guitars-bass-drums. Certainly he adores his ironic, prankish sense of humor. And certainly he adores the career band that's now surpassed Galaxie 500 on every semi-commercial and artistic level. Yet though Romantica doesn't really sound all that different from Pup Tent or Bewitched (though not the masterful Penthouse), there's something missing in the mix. Could be the detached post-modern eye he turns towards his romantic travails - very continental, don't you think? Could be the thudding lyricism he aims for and misses on many of these tracks. Could be love isn't Wareham's great subject - seduction is, especially when he has to try just a little bit harder than he does once he gets what he wants."
4,"Luna - always good, sometimes great. This time it's good.","Luna is a brilliant band -- terrific live and innovative in the studio. Romantica builds on Dean Wareham's well-honed Luna formula of catchy, languid lyrics and invigorating guitar melodies, but fails to capture the ephemeral greatness of Penthouse (one of the greatest albums in modern rock history) and Bewitched. The modern quartet of Wareham, Eden, Phillips, and Wall just can't seem to capture the essence that once was when Harwood and Demeski were powering Wareham and Eden's guitar work. (Though Phillips and Wareham sing together splendidly on ""Mermaid Eyes."")In a relative sense, anything Luna releases is brilliant. But by their lofty standards, Romantica is a good - not great - piece of work. I only hope they manage to keep the band going for several more years, I have a hunch they have one more masterpiece to unfurl before the run is over."
2,Time for retirement,"This cd strikes a new low point in Luna's recording career. It's definitely not the same band that put out Penthouse and Pup Tent--both great cds. If you are new to Luna, start with those recordings and work your way down to this dud, but only if you feel it's absolutely necessary. Personally, I feel the band was much better with Stanley Demeski on drums and Justin Harwood on bass. The new girl is definitely distracting Dean with her cheesy sultriness and weak, whispy vocals. Why can't more bands follow the worthy precedent set by the Beatles and break up before they get terrible?"
4,"i've said it before, i'll say it again.....","i've always maintained that luna would be the ideal house band in heaven. romantica doesn't change that opinion. what is wrong with you people who resent a band evolving. you hated pup tent and i thought it was playful genius. perhaps you're not really luna fans at all. granted, penthouse was a superb work, but get over it....they're still moderately brilliant and joyous to listen to. this is a terrific album."
4,"Brilliantly imaginative, if somewhat tedious.","To the people who hate this book, I grant you the freedom of your opinion, but I have to say, ""You don't get it!"" This isn't a narrative in the traditional sense of the word. Instead, Calvino has taken complex scientific principles and turned them into stories. Its true that there is a certain lack of character development, as the main character is a one-dimensional atomic particle (pun intended), but even so, Calvino makes him(it?) come alive in his tales. The true feature and attraction of these stories are the situation and worlds that Calvino creates. All that being said, I read this in the same day that I read Cosmicomics, which is a prior collections of similar stories featuring the same character (and, I think, a better book overall), and the artist's conceit wore a little thin. However, if you can give these books sufficient time and space(pun intended again), they are truly fun and beautiful."
4,As advertised,No problems. Simple connector. No problems with install. Device I connected to found it with no problems. Didn't even need the driver CD.
2,Not the latest,"Purchased this item as I read that it was Windows Vista compatible, BUT, this was an early version which is not compatible."
2,Doesn't provide a useful description of the movements,I've been taking T'ai Chi classes for several months and I bought this book hoping that it would supplement my instruction. I have an excellent teacher but there are so many elements to each movement that I thought it would help to have static images that I could examine at my leisure. I haven't found this book useful in that respect. The main problem is that it's not clear how the pictures relate to the written descriptions of the movements. Even for sections of the form that I know very well I am often unable to figure out which movement the pictures are trying to convey.
3,"Good general information, poor form instruction.","It is not possible for me to study Tai Chi with a master so I must relay on books and video tapes to learn the forms. The Tai Chi Workbook lacks sufficient graphic information about the postures and transitions to enable me to do this. McFarlan's book, while lacking the general information, does a much clearer job of demonstrating the form."
3,Good for White Noise,"I purchased this CD based on the reviews and because I was looking for calm music for myself and for my baby. While the sound of waves is good for my little one, I didn't find much ""music"" in the CD for myself. To me, it seemed like one long CD of the same wave sounds and not from different coastal waters as people have mentioned--no real variation."
5,Everday Wisdon,"This little book is replete with uplifting thoughts for everyone, for so many of the challenges we are faced with at any given moment. Whatever is not applicable today, may be so at another time in our lives. It's simple without being trite or preachy."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"As a collector of useful and thought provoking quotes I can confidently say that there is nothing of value here. Vapid, empty, boring, naive, and utterly lacking do not go far enough in describing the content of this book. Of the few one-liners that did contain any substance, they are simple re-wordings of easily identifiable famous quotes by other writers know for their witticism (i.e. Ben Franklin, Tao Te Ching, Jesus, etc.). Other quotes are confusing if taken literally or thoroughly pointless if examined with a critical eye.Clearly other than re-publishing others' work, very little effort was put into this work. If this is and exhaustive list of Dr. Wayne Dyer's wisdom, this man should be institutionalized. He is certainly a danger to himself not to mention the countless others that buy his books. Be careful who you choose as you teacher."
5,Absolutely excellent,"I purchased this cassette 2 years ago and am now replacing it; I listen to it A LOT! I find it easy to quote the statements/affirmations in many different situations in life (I have almost memorized them). The tape really does offer words of wisdom. I, unlike another reviewer, like the short statements, as varied as they are, rather than a continuous dialogue. Mr. Dyer states that the tape is designed this way, to pick out one idea at a time. I can listen to it over and over again, and still catch something I missed, or understood differently before. If you want to hear a postive message, if you want to retrain your thinking to a loving/positive mode, I can't say enough good about the message on this tape."
4,Full of inspiration and motivational quotes........,"I love these small books full of great little inspiration quotes. I believe a slightly better book is The Power of Influence - Life Lessons On Relationships by John Maxwell.The key to ranking this book depends on what you are seeking to get out of the book. I believe the title, Everyday Wisdom, is correct. The only thing that would have been a bit more helpful would have been better organization throughout. It seems to jump around a lot but, overall, the book is very inspirational.They key to getting long-term value out of a book like this is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life. Practice what you read essentially. Hope this helps everyone."
5,Literary gem,"After finding this book while on vacation in one of those little beach town bookstores, I immediately read it and 4 years later, I am still finding that the wisdoms continue to apply and deepen in meaning. Instead of a book, I think of it rather as daily affirmations- each one different for whatever it is that I am experiencing on that particular day.I recommend this book for everyone and anyone. What I enjoy most about this book is its spiritual undertones, which can be applied to any religion or spiritual background."
5,Organic Sulfur Compounds,This book is the finest review of early work on the chemistry of sulfur. It includes many early pioneering work on the organic chemistry of sulfur and the sulfonation on numerous organic compounds. Suter's knowledge and vision is amazing. This book is for anyone wanting and solid background into sulfur chemisrty. Suter lead the way for many chemists that followed him in developing soe many useful and unique products. An essential a vital reference work.
3,"Good for Short Term Traders, but...","Kiev's thesis rests upon the premise of setting profit goals and then trying to hit them. The idea is that you will be compelled to refine everthing about your trading and put away all excuses in order to reach this goal -- a sort of goal as catalyst for improvement theory. While this seems like good advice I am afraid that for longer term traders it runs headlong into the ""only take what the market gives you"" truism. If I set a goal of $10,000 per month, what do I do when the market goes nowhere for four weeks? You guessed it, I would try to force things. Not good. So unless you are willing to accept the thesis of setting specific profit goals you won't gain that much from this book. A much better treatment of general trading psychology can be found in Mark Douglas' ""Trading in the Zone""."
4,Fast read; informative and helpful. Kiev's best,This was definitely Kiev's best book yet. What made the difference between it and Trading to Win was that it was actually helpful and laid out a course of action. Trading to win was chockful of examples but you were unsure of how you fit into it.The book is full of little tests to determine what type of trader you are. Unfortunately he is not big on advice you sorta figure that out yourself after reading so many pages of what's your best course of action.The downside to the book though is the Master Trader section which sorta drones on.Still his best.
3,Not what I expected,I got the Kindle version and only go through a chapter or two before I realized that this book is not about the Psychology of Risks but how to trade in a risky market. I really don't need someone telling me how I should trade when I get nervous. I wanted detailed information about the studies that have been done on market psychology. I really didn't read the whole book so I can't say if it got any better.
3,Handle with care!,"Extremely delicate and light. Will definitely blow away in a strong breeze, even with the spikes/stands that are provided. One fall on gravel or sticks is enough to mark it up and scratch off the dark coloring. It was great because I was in a pinch for decorations to last just a few hours, but I would think twice about purchasing these for constant or short-term use outside. I have no idea how they react with water, but I suspect it won't be pretty if it rains on these."
5,Che Taggia Di? ;),"This cd has everything that 'all' cds should have. Great music, a wonderful front cover (colorful cartoon'ish caricatures of the performers), many photos inside, and also the lyrics to all of the songs. This cd is one of many which my Roman friend sent me when I first started to explore the world of modern Italian music and it has remained one of my favorites. The combination of Adriano Celentano's and Mina's mature vocal talents is magical and the end result is a grand performance above and beyond any of their solo cds. If God came down from heaven today and told me I could only listen to 5 cds till the end of eternity... then this would be one of them.Ciao---buon giornata!"
5,SOUPer book!!,What a delightfully illustrated cookbook!! Just received it and can't wait to get started!! The illustrations are splendid as is the easy to read recipes!! Enjoy!
4,blue moon soup,This book for being used was in excelent condition as was told. Beautifully illutrated. It was delivered on time.This book was everything I was told it would be. Love this book.
4,A Good Collection of Shakespeare,Riverside is a good collection of Shakespeare's works. There are no edited out parts. What you get is what Shakespeare wrote. Using it for an 300 level English class just for Shakespeare.
4,Good stories and plenty of incite to the imagination of Shakespeare,I want to let you know that all the stories that are in this book are very relevant to the Shakespeare era. It was a great book large and not all that boring.
5,A great anthology,"I have taken a number of Shakespeare classes and this is easily my favorite anthology of the four or five I have had to purchase, and is, in fact, the only one I kept. It has a ton of extra information, and it is organized well. The pages are thinner than a King James Bible, and despite how delicate they felt, I somehow managed to never tear them. As anthologies go, I don't think it gets much better than this."
5,Excellent content and presentation,"As an English student, I found this book invaluable when I took a course on Shakespeare. The plays and sonnets are given in complete, and there is an amazing amount of background information for each. Also, like others who have reviewed on this text, I didn't find the footnotes to get in the way while I was reading- although they were very useful when I actually needed them. It's a beautiful (albeit heavy) text, one that merits distinction in the litany of Shakespeare books that are available."
4,The Collegiate Shakespeare,"Opportunity may present itself suddenly over the course of a lifetime. My opportunity came in 2002, returning to University studies as a senior. Over the course of two years I was able to take courses in the Humanities that I had always wanted.One of the romances I had developed was a love of Shakespeare. There are many editions out there of course. I had the traditional standard store bought edition produced by Doubleday with the illustrations by Rockwell Kent.The requirements of a course in Shakespeare necessitated that I purchase ""The Riverside Shakespeare"" and I agreee with everyone else who has made a statement here that it is far superior to others.The background notes, the Black and White plates, even the Introduction is very interesting and a joy to read. The reference notes are very useful and it is a perfect course presentation edition that translates well to reading Shakespeare for the general reader. Well recommended."
4,"Excellent text, but bulky","I have had my Riverside (1974 edn.) since college and still use it constantly. I can't break myself of it because the text is so good: the editor, G. B. Evans, is very cautious about changing the texts and even retains a few original spellings, so it feels very Elizabethan. Another good text is Pelican/Penguin, but it's expensive to buy all those individual volumes. Drawbacks: as another reviewer says, the notes are hard to keep track of, and the thing is so darned bulky! / I saw the new 2-volume edition in a bookstore recently and was disappointed. Most of the pages are photographically reproduced from the first edition, but they look like photocopies rather than the real thing. At least the smaller volumes might be easier to handle."
4,Complete collection,A comprehensive and complete collection of Shakespeare's works. It also has very well written introductions about the plays and sonnets.
4,Pleasantly Pleased,"The book was in great shape, except for the lower right hand corner of the front cover. I think this bend in the book cover is mostly due to the packaging, or lack there of. The big text book was just placed in a cardboard box without any filler or wrapping of any type. Of course, I can still read the book and use it for class, so I am pleasantly pleased."
5,A fresh new sound for Informatik,"I was a fan of Informatik before, but when I first heard their new album, Nymphomatik, I was pleasantly surprised. They abandoned the old slow formula for a fast paced, high energy feel easily comparable to Funker Vogt. The first 8 tracks on Nymphomatik are all gold material, but my favorites would have to be Flesh Menagerie and A Matter Of Time. The only point at which the album starts to decline in quality is with the last 3 tracks. 96 Degrees is just a bridge to the 2 remixes that follow of Perfect Stranger and Physical Education, which aren't nearly as good as the originals. However, the rest of the album is so great it doesn't even seem worth complaining about. I for one love this new style for Informatik, and hope they continue to develop future songs in this manner. If you are a industrial/EBM fan of any kind, Nymphomatik is the album to buy."
2,Yucky!,"I admit that I do like the song ""Built For Pleassure"". That is pterry much about it though. This is just a cheesy band as far as I have heard. These songs are just silly and I doubt that they will be making anymore records after this crappy album. They act like some kind of a rivet-stud duo...and the guys voice is annoying...especially on the really bad song ""Physical Education"". If you like cheese...than here it is...enjoy!"
1,Horrible immitation,I bought the CD thinking that these excellent hits where sung by the original singers. It was a bad immitation of some obscure band singing all these big hits. I had to return it.
4,Solid performer,"This drive is a good complement to my G5 Power Mac computer. In the few months that I've had it, it has been a solid performer. You have your choice of FireWire or USB interfaces. And the case is designed to go well with the aluminum ""cheese grator"" cases of the Power Mac (G5) and Mac Pro (Xeon) Apple towers. It doesn't go quite as far in the looks as one of the other competitors, but it is close enough. For those with a computer that doesn't have an aluminum finished case, the drive may look out of place, but most people do not buy a hard drive for its appearance. After my issues with another vendor's 1 TB drive, I was pleased when this drive just worked as expected."
3,"Drive fan bad, sounds like a sick cow...",Drive is fine except that:1. Not compatible with apple airport extreme basestation due to block size issue.2. More importantly - very noisy fan (probably damaged) sounds so bad I can't be in the same room.And there's no obvious way to get support from IOMega without paying $25/call.
2,"I had two, one for the photos, video and music and another for backup on Time Machine. Both died within a month","I just took the hard disks from within the enclosure and put them into a Drobo and 3 out of the 4 drives are working just fine. It looks as if the circuit boards that held them together fried but the actual drives (but for one) are fine. As to Drobo, it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! Specially the last one with Firewire 800 to the Mac and really silent."
1,Failed after 2 years,"My problem is similar to others I have read here. First, after two years, the power switch became non-functioning. The drive started turning off and on by itself sporadically, and finally just stayed on (electrical power). Secondly, the drive now either won't mount on the desktop, or it mounts and unmounts for no reason, making it impossible to use. Now I need to back up a Terabyte of data, but cannot keep it mounted long enough to copy anything. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Iomega; buy another brand."
1,No wonder it's no longer available.,"I purchased this hard drive in July and it stopped working within 2 months. I have a MAC OS X, Snow Leopard 10.6.1. I was able to file all of my info and thought it was going to be great. In a few weeks the icon would not appear on my desktop. Sometimes it would appear but would disappear leaving a message that it had been improperly ejected. Now it never appears. I did get a message after it disappeared the last time saying the backup had failed. Anyone have any luck with fixes? I have not had any satisfaction from the Iomega Web Site but I do intend to write to them."
1,Died after about 12 months.,"During the time I had it, I was pretty excited about having a Terabyte of data sitting next to my Imac. I moved all of my photos, Imovie & Itunes & Apple TV files over here to keep the Imac running smooth. About two weeks before the crash, it started having a hard time connecting to the Imac, I got nervous about it, went out and bought a Time Capsule (which took about 7 days to back everything up) then about another 2 weeks after that, I sat down to start doing some backups to dvds (I kept reading that I should have some solid state copies of at files) And I never got started - the drive would not connect - I spent a few days trying to get at it - and gave up. Now I'm shopping for external drives again. I emailed support through the IOmega site, did not get a response."
1,It WILL stop working,"Purchased and used lightly for file back-ups every month off my iMac. Came home today and the fan was spinning very high, could not shut off with power switch, disconnected power and re-attached, same issue persists. Most likely fried ... Again, this was lightly used. I can no longer recommend iOmega drives."
1,Dead just outside 1 year warranty,"Hard drive died shortly after 1 year warranty period. Won't power up at all anymore. I could probably swap drives to another enclosure, but I have backups that I'll use instead.Also, the power light on the drive is very bright, which makes it unsuitable for use in a home theater environment with dim lighting.This is my last Iomega drive purchase."
2,The worst external hard drive ever,"I have had this product for 6 months and now it's dying. Anytime i keep standing by it while my computer is running, it will hang by itself automatically if i want to get into it again. I have 4 external hard drive including this one. THis one is the most expensive and worst one. I also have another 1TB external hard drive that costed me only$99 with only USB2.0 but works much better, half thinner design and more stable. I need to turn off and on this IOMEGA 2-3 times whenever I want to use to make it really boost itself to show up on the desktop. Stupid external harddrive ever. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Nice looking crap,"Mine died almost exactly one year after purchase. Worked fine up until then, but who cares. Does a reliable large capacity hard drive exist anywhere?"
4,Not a bad album.,Herbie Hancock laid it down once again on this solid recording. The tracks on here are quite melodic and funky as well. This cd is definitely worth having in one's jazz collection.
2,Raging,"As a movie, it just didnt have the impact to sustain my attention.What was stunning was what the Director captured thru the lens. Some great B/W shots"
1,Attempt at Artistic - Fail,"The best way for me to describe this film is find the drugs the director and producer were on, and view it using them. The cinematography is interesting at first, but quickly gets old. The lack of dialogue not only makes it difficult at best to discern a story line, but also makes it virtually impossible to emotionally connect to any character.One reviewer was impressed that the actors were ""nude 90% of the time."" Ok, the director managed to achieve something any porn director pulls off in almost every film.I've seen well-made art films that use black and white, that use symbolic imagery. Ingmar Bergman's ""Seventh Seal"" is a touch-stone film in that category. This film, however, succeeds only in showing a narcissistic director presenting a look into his own lack of ability to create a meaningful experience for the viewer.I threw mine away."
2,"Raging Sun, Raging Sky, Boring","Two young men fall in love , get torn apart and have to go through a terrible ordeal and separtion before they're allowed to be together again. First part of the film is 'current', the second part is more mythical and silly. It's a Spanish film but there is extremely little dialogue. The film is unnecessarily long, in my opinion. It's a gay film and if you're hoping to have some good looks at hot 'bits', this is not the film. The directors other film, Broken Sky, is strikingly similar and quite boring too."
1,raging sun...,one of the worst movies i have ever tried to watch! the acting is so amatuer and the camera work leaves so much to the imagination. i sent this film back to the vendor for a refund. i cant express to anyone intrested how poor this movie is on so many levels.
1,just six,i guess i'm not into movies where there are a lot of killing for sex just so some one can eat
1,"Very abstract, black and white, silent movie","There really is NO dialog in this black and white movie. If you like modern, abstract ballet, where you have to guess what the storyline might be about exactly, you may like this movie."
1,Not even the children enjoyed this film.,"I really, and I mean really, wanted to enjoy this film. I unfortunately would have to say this film was terrible. The animation, the script, the acting... not one of my favorite Disney films. My children love watching films. They are currently four and two years of age, but this film did not catch their attention whatsoever."
1,My kids hated this movie,"Not sure why, but this movie is so poorly written conceived and performed even my young children couldn't watch it. I buy anything 3D, but not this one.."
4,Good movie,"This movie was pretty good. Me and my family saw it and now my sister wants it on dvd! I liked it and it was pretty clean. (besides him and a duck kiss) but, why do all these movies have to be about where your dad doesn't believe in you, then you make him proud? ok not all these movies, but still. but, i liked it and reccomend it to kids 5-12."
5,chicken little DVD,The dvd was just as described and was very satisfied with the product. I would order from them again. thanks
5,Chicken Little,My grandson love this movie. I love finding movies that my children grew up on and now I can pass it on to my grandchildren on DVD or Blue Ray....
4,about the case?,"I need an answer to a question concerning the case. I recently bought a used Chicken Little movie and it had a cheap flimsy case wirh a frame backing covered over with transparent material. Did Disney do that or did the seller? I don't want to make a false accusation against the seller, but I can't amagine Disney doing such a thing. Would you please respond. I need to know one way or the other."
5,Great for BIG and small kids@,"My 5 year old son loves this movie so much we have rented it over 5 times. By this time, we should have just purchased it.The story is quirky and at the same time relatable. The humor is made for small children, but grown ups will also enjoy the meaning behind the story: a broken father-son relationship that is restored through quite an adventure."
1,Disappointment Indeed.,"I saw Chicken Little a few weeks ago and I was not impressed at all.The plot was not very interesting, there were few humorous parts, and halfway through the movie I was squirming in my seat waiting for it to end.I do not recommend seeing this movie, I had high hopes....and that was all that they were."
4,Funny,"It's a kid's movie. It does all it is supposed to do. It keeps the adults entertained, while the kids are mesmerized."
3,3-D Animation meets Science fiction - This is a kid's movie?,"Kids will like it, cause they can relate to cuteness, and there are funny moments. But the ""War of the Worlds"" send up with Chicken Little, was just weird. The animal citizens get zapped by some alien acorns, what? The fish driving cars were funny, but in general, it made me want to fry eggs and buy chicken for dinner. This is NOT a classic Disney movie. Bring back ""Beauty and the Beast"", please...."
3,Cute and kids will love it but that's about it,"Dinsey needs to come up with better films like Beuty and the beast, Aladian, Lion King becouse in the direction it's going it's going down hill. I have to say the movie did not suck and it was not bad but it wasent really good. The movie aims more at he young audience which movies cant really do now becouse adults enjoy animated films more then kids for example Shrek 1 and 2, Incrediables, Finding Nemo and more too name. The film's story is ok it's like the classic story but thsi time it shows what happend next. The animation is cute and the whole time you watch it your thinking ah cute or the animation is good but what's the story. There is not much of a story to this film and it's very short as soon as I got into it it was over. Overall it's an enjoyable film for kids but adults may get board with it but it's fun to watch for the animation and the odd funny moments."
5,Question,"I am curious, what is the difference between the blu-ray and the regular dvd?Does the blu-ray still work in the regular dvd player?Thank you."
2,Trying too hard,"Despite being an adorable little chicken, something feel extremely off about this movie. The plot is way too campy and well, weird. Apparently, the budget couldn't afford original music and so we're left with a lot of Karoke stuff. Some sentimental lines sound eerily like rips from Finding Nemo. I fell a sleep on the movie the first time and the second time, I kept wondering how much longer the film was-when it was a short movie to begin with. Overall, this movie totally missed the mark, but very young children may enjoy it, but probably would get a lot more out of something like Jimmy Newtron or something."
2,Immature,"This movie can be funny at times. My brother loved it. However, it is mostly meant for kids and the plot is stupid. I personally hated the characters. Runt of the Litter was probably my least-favorite; I just found him annoying. Abby was okay but she got annoying after telling Chicken Little that him and his dad needed ""closure"". I was like, ""Just leave the poor guy alone!"" As for Chicken Little himself, he was all right. I felt sorry for him. His dad was okay, too, but I found him a little mean.The movie is stupid, but the plot ids oaky. It could have been carried out differently.Yo, buy, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeds!( that means dude, dude)"
1,Rated G? Not appropriate for kids!,"This movie is not at all appropriate for children to view. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter as a gift. Shortly into the film I found several mature references. If you care about what your kids watch and are being fed through movies, then stay clear of this DVD."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Yesterday I took a huge dump. Then I looked at it for 81 minutes. It was 1000 times better than this movie. My nephew was watching it and it was so bad he threw up. Aliens? Zach Braff? That terrible baseball scene where Little hits a homerun and those boners are scurrying around the outfield. What? Please, my 2 year old said, ""Daddy, this movie blows. Why did you do this to me? Do you not love me?"" I was like, ""Dude, I'm sorry. Can you ever forgive me?""I heard Mickey Mouse started drinking heavily after he watched this monstrosity and he hasn't been seen since. I'm going to eat chicken for every meal for the rest of my life just because this movie was that bad. Next time I see a dam chicken clucking around like he owns the joint I'ma boot em right up his ahhhhhhss."
3,Old time goodness,"proves that some of this stuff is very age dependent, my five yr old didnt get it but I did! had a blast"
2,Chicken Little,"Never thought I'd see the day, but Disney flunked with this one. Mr. Cohen's review says it looks like a bad muppet show and he is right. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. Incredibly clunky, bad sound, just plain bad."
5,loved it,"chicken little appealed to everyone left at the end of Thanksgiving, from 3 year old grandson to 65 year old grandma.Liked the double-meaning innuendos as well as just plain fun."
5,Cute Movie!,My 5 year old loves this movie! It is great quality and funny! Great movie for ages 3 and up :)
3,Tribbles invade,"Adults might find this one fun to watch with the pre-pre-teen crowd. Those between the ages of 10 and 20 will most likely hate it. I liked it for the life lessons, even though they were taught with cliches most times. The beginning and end were tied-in cleverly. The animation was very good. The aliens will remind you of the classic Star Trek episode, ""The Trouble with Tribbles""."
5,Fun for the whole family,"A cute movie, with humor for adults too. I have 3 year olds that love to watch this movie and it's a frequent request. It's great for teaching kids about learning to do things for yourself, and that sometimes we need friends and family's help too. It's about sticking to your guns and believing in yourself, and about the relationship kids and parents can have too. It can be good for helping kids understand that parents aren't infallible and sometimes we don't see the things that are bothering them as problems, until they tell us what the problem is."
1,boring,"my kids wouldnt even watch it, wish I hadnt rented it. dont know why it was even a rentable movie, what a waste."
2,Chicken Droppings,"CHICKEN LITTLE rehashes WAR OF THE WORLDS and INDEPENDENCE DAY giving it a slight twist using barn animals instead of humans. Nothing new here. WARNER BROTHERS should sue DISNEY for character infringment too. Doesn't the title character ""Chicken Little"" look uncannily like EGGHEAD JR., one of the supporting characters from Warner Bros/Looney Toons FOGHORN LEGHORN cartoon series? Hold pictures of both characters next to each other... they look exactly alike."
1,An acorn fell on the Disney Corporation!,"In one word ""BAD."" Disney calls this talent? It doesn't get much worse than this. No talent and not even close to the original story. I guess if you come from the computer generation of cold creation and you have been starved for real motion picture entertainment and you have a brain cell of a ""nat"" then you might enjoy this film. Be safe and buy your kid a real Disney movie meaning before Walt died and before Eisner took over. Disney has lost all of their true talent. All i can say is poor Walt......"
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this one. I was expecting a smart movie full of imagination and beautiful animation. Well, the animators did a great job, but the writing was really bad as was the direction. Most of the characters I didn't care about. The rest were just annoying. Like the pig. I was bored all through this movie."
4,Delightful DVD To Be Enjoyed By Young and Old !!,"Another piece of colorful Disney Magic worth having. The cast of interesting characters includes: Chicken Little, Ugly Ducking, Fish Out Of Water, Buck Cluck, Foxy Loxy, and many others. The full color graphics are great and the story line held our family's interest until the end. Numerous extras are included, such as 3 different openings, making of the DVD, Trivia Game, Karaoke Sing Along, Cheetah Girls Music Video, Barenaked Ladies Music Video. Our family enjoyed it, in-fact it has been viewed several times since we got it. The technology available today is unbelievable !!"
2,Chicken Little,"My husband and I took our two children, 3 and 5, to see this film. We were all disappointed. My husband joked that the best part of the film is that it was only 70 minutes!!! The children, who are usually enraptured in Disney movies, could not have been any less interested. In the way of the Shreck films, the movie humor was geared towards adults... not that we found it in the least bit funny.Forty dollars later, we found ourselves asking why did we bother? The best part of the outing was getting to spend time with our children. Save your money and find another way to spend your valuable family time. This film is a waste of time."
4,Cute,"It's an alright movie, wouldn't rate it one of my top favorite Disney movies but its a must if you want the whole Disney collection!"
4,nice kids movie,this movie looks so good on bluray its incredible the sound is excellent to great demo movie to show what your tv can do
3,cute and funny but...,"Chicken little is adorable, with cute characters and some very funny scenes. But, the plotline's just not the best, and perhaps it's more little kid-oriented. take your 6-7 year olds to see it and i guarantee they will LOVE it, as long as they dont get scared with the alien attack scenes. those are a bit scary!i hope this was helpful. thank you for reading."
4,"Cute show, love the songs","My daughter loves this show and the songs are great too. I wasn't expecting the alien invasion when I first watched it, but its still a fun show. Well built characters."
5,Good family fun,"As an artist, I have my share of animated movies for their quality animation, story lines and their vivid colors. This movie fits all those categories as well. It's fun, entertaining and colorful. Highly recommend it."
1,Just plain bad,"I am still waiting for these studios to learn that going out and buying a bunch of computers and graphics software does not make you Pixar.The characters are drawn badly, their movements are ruff and awkward, and the story line is uncreative and dull."
2,The dvd was unwrapped when it arrived,"The dvd was unwrapped when it came. The dvd was fine, looked new... but the fact i was giving it as a gift this was a problem. It looked like i was giving a used dvd as a present.not happy about it"
1,"Movie Misrated, I can't believe it is 'G'","A lot of violence for a G rated movie. More along the line of The Incredibles which was rated PG.I am glad I prescreened this movie. I definitely will NOT be taking my 4 year old daughter to see it. She was so frightened by the violence in The Incredibles that she was shaking and we had to leave the theater.The violence in this movie is on the same par.I loved The Incredibles, but it wasn't for my daughter.Chicken Little, on the other hand, doesn't have any redeeming qualities.The story was weak and contrived.how bad is it?See it in theaters: no.Wait for the DVD: no.Wait for it to come on TV: no, watch something else...Disney needs to remmeber it is the STORY that is important, not the way it is animated. CGI for CGI's sake is a fast road to mediocraty.Still waiting for the next ""Nemo"" quality movie..."
3,I enjoyed more than I thought I would,It was a cute modern update of a classic children's story. The pop culture references in it was funny. I liked the character of Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) and wonder why they didn't put her on the cover instead a the porcupine (Fonzie type character) who had only in the movie a few brief moments. I wish Joan would do more movies because she amuses me. The one character that annoyed me was the Fish Out Of Water with Runt Of The Litter second. Neither bothered me too much or I wouldn't have liked the story at all considering they were major characters.This is a good movie for kids and adults who want to escape reality for awhile.
4,Fun movie,"A good movie for kids. Not as good as others like Cars or Nemo, but still fun nonetheless."
4,Better than I thought it would be BUT,"An OK Disney film.I did not think it was as bad as I had heard it was supposed to be.Made the story for today's audience, other wise getting points of view across not an enjoyable story to live through the ages & can be enjoyed by an audience 20 or 30 years from now, just for today`s audience. Reminds me of Brother Bear.A BIG disappointment , however, was the LACK of a Disney soundtrack. What I mean here is rerecordings of older pop songs. That was a shame."
1,Run HOT!,"Bought a few of each of these for trying in an enclosed glass sculpture, but found these run hotter than 4 & 7 watt incandescents - too hot to touch metal base parts for a few minutes after delamping. Probably something to do with stepping down line voltage. Not what you'd expect from LED's. Nice colors, but I wouldn't trust these."
1,Didn't work,No signs of this being effective. People are created different so maybe it will work for you. Nor the same product I took years ago.
4,One of the hardest books to find,"I have been looking all over for this book & when I finally found it, I was totally happy with it. It not only has recipies which are African American friendly but, it also gives guidelines to methods of menu setup and item replacement. A really great find."
2,Not Enough Details - - Assumes use of unavailable Software,"This title is not up to the high standards set by McLachlan's other books. The text does not get into details which are thoroughly discussedin McLachlan's excellent ""The EM Algorithm and Extensions."" Some important points are so condensed and in places so poorly presented that the the discussion is worthless. For example the important section 3.4 ""Standard Errors"", which underlies much of the discussion contains errors.The book could be useful to a practioner who is only looking for guidance in fitting mixture models with available software. Unfortanately McLachlan's mixture software referred to in the Appendix, is not available. That's a pity because the advertised software features and design potentially rank it the top choice.For a user who will use his own EM software to fit mixture models I would recommend highly the McLachlan's EM Algorithm book over the Mixture book."
5,Must read.,"This book is a must read for all Americans. Taber opens the door for knowing our Muslim friends, neighbors, acquaintances, by listening to them and trying to understand how much we are alike instead of focusing on our differences."
3,It's okay.,"If looking for a book that will help you understand the Muslim perspective, there are better books available (e.g., Islams for Idiots)."
3,Old information...,"I purchased this to see if I can learn anything new about Fasting Hypoglycemia. I have fasting hypoglycemia as a result of gastric bypass surgery that I had in 2003. The publishing date on this book is fairly old 1992. The information is nothing you wouldn't find online for free. Yes, the book cost one penny, but it's not worth the shipping too. You can and will find all information for free online; not only that, the information will be current. A good book, but not worth purchasing."
4,Low Blood Sugar,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she says it is great. Everything you ever want to know about low blood sugar! Great price too!!
1,"extremely dispointed - cereal box product, extremely overpriced","This phone looks much better in a photo than in real life. It's a very light weight white plastic. It has an annoying piercing ring tone. And worst of all, I paid the full price here of $95 plus $10 shipping, when two days ago I found his exact same model phone at Target for only $49.99. Color me a sucker."
4,Very practical,"I had been searching for a book organizer for some time, withoug much success.I am quite happy with my find on Amazon. This BookNotes is practical, efficient and lightweight. I mention the weight issue because I intended to carry this book with me everywhere and did not, therefore, want it to be a burden.The sections are: Tracking system for books loaned (could have done without this), Book Notes (to me the most valuable part of this book - they could have added a few more pages to this section), Notes to Myself (always helpful)and numbers of note.Nice clear printing (large letters) and wonderful quotations on books can be found throughout.Excellent purchase."
4,"Good book, better than most","I like the book and the layout. It's simple and has space for store numbers, addresses, book club stuff if you're into that and lots of space, alphabetically, for books. Really my only complaint is that there isn't more room for notes for each book. You can fit lots of titles but are better off keeping only brief notes or questions in the journal and longer notes perhaps tucked inside on a separate sheet of paper... of course that means you're taking notes and if not then it's a great solution! Again, good format, clean, simple appearance. I like it much better than most I've seen because it is more than just a lined journal. It's nicely organized and intuitive."
4,Interesting documentary,"I always assumed that talented basketball players would be immediately recognized and that it would be a given they would play in the NBA. However, by watching this documentary, I saw that talent can fall by the wayside if a person's life choices are self-destructive. This documentary is interesting because it asks, what could have been? The filmmakers were able to highlight and present ""Hook"" Mitchell in a positive portrayal. I felt some sympathy and compassion for his circumstances.I read that after his release from prison, he trained with the California State Warriors, but was cut. I wonder why - too old? not disciplined enough? couldn't keep up with the competition?This film made me somewhat reflective and contemplative."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent series of books for non-ethnic Chinese to learn Mandarin. Excellent web text and support materials, including drills, quiz etc. My students enjoyed and benefited from it greatly."
5,Superb!,"This is an excellent choice for boys and girls (even adults who are young at heart).The marvelously fascinating story draws you in and propels you right along side these nine intriguing children: Horace, the Keeper Of Time; Alex, the car enthusiast; Paige, the book lover; Keegan, the martial arts fan; Alyssa, the animal lover; Caelan, the artist; Dara, the computer whiz; Brina, the visionary; and Pepper, the skater. They are each very different, and that is what makes them so appealing. Everyone will find at least one character that they can relate to. The author has cleverly brought these kids together in a time-morphing adventure that shows us everyone is important and has something to offer. This is a wonderful life lesson for the real world.Highly recommended!"
5,An Excellent Biography!,This was a very good writing of the life story of Nelson A.Rockefeller. This book tells you of the wealth that Rockefeller was raised in. It then takes him to adulthood. His years of government service are well covered by the author. His four terms as the Governor of the state of New York are documented. His term as Vice-President of the United States is also in thisbook. His being dropped from the Republican ticket is also toldin detail in this book. Rockefeller's life is well covered in this book. His service is unquestioned. You will also notice thatRockefeller was the force that brought several good people to government service. Buy this book and read it. You will not bedissapointed.
4,fast paced adrenaline pumping story of a delivery gone bad….,"fast paced adrenaline pumping story of a delivery gone bad. bad cops, underground smuggling, rivalries, and growing love help keep this movie exciting from start to finish."
3,Great for movie night at home,Glad I didn't go to the movies to see this but it was good to watch one night at home.
4,Great Movie,"My girlfriend and I both enjoyed this movie. I can't even begin to claim it is the best movie of all time, but it certainly is worth the hour and a half you would have otherwise spent bored watching re-runs"
3,"Decent action film, short on plot","Te movie was what I expected, plenty of action including numerous chase scenes. The plot was thin and the characters lacked development, but it was a fun ride."
4,"Rented on a whim, enjoyed a lot...","Not your typical ""action"" movie but I enjoyed it a lot. No explosions or super special effects, but Gordon-Levitt delivers another good performance. It may not be your cup of tea but give it a shot if you're in the mood to roll the dice. Definitely a worthwhile rental."
4,entertaining and well put together...,"Ok so this movie was very well written and entertaining. Even if you don't dig biking or riding a bike, the way they made the bike scenes and the chasing scenes were very clever. It kept me on my seat for most of the movie. The plot is kind of a simple one but it achieves its goal by entertaining even the viewer who wouldn't normally watch this kind of movie. I can see why maybe it didn't do the best at the movie theater because even with JGL the trailer didn't appeal to a wide audience but Oh well... it was good regardless."
2,Light plot with average acting,Just felt a little light in the plot and acting department. A real show for kids would not watch again.
2,SO so movie,This movie is ok for a rent I guess but the presentation and some of the acting is a little hokey. I wouldnt recommend for a purchase and I just think it is average or less for a rental.
2,Premium snooze,"Don't bother. Stupid story. Totally contrived. Average acting and below average dialogue. After the terrific opening shot, it's all down hill (with a helmet, of course)."
3,Fun Ride - Despite Horrible Acting of Some Characters,"I really liked this movie, glad I didn't see in theatres. The bad cop guy in this film is a horrible actor, really bad. He made me want to just turn the movie off at several points. The action was fun, not completely realistic, but hey its a movie for a cold Saturday night when there is to much snow on the road to go to the theatre. Its a strong 3 stars. Not a lot of violence, but when there is it is pretty rough for me.(the end scene with bad cop)"
4,This movie is enjoyable...and Joseph Gordon Levitt is adorable in it.,"This is a fun movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt is adorable in it. I also liked the actress who plays his girlfriend. I could watch this movie again...it's one of those kind of movies that if there's nothing else on I can pop this in and enjoy it.I've seen it twice now and I still don't understand what the Bad Guy was up to. I don't want to spoil anything, but JGL plays a bike messenger and the Bad Guy wants something he is carrying. I still don't know why the Bad Guy wants that envelope, how he found out about it, etc. I will have to pay more attention the next time I watch this to see if I can figure that out. It's just sort of random that this guy is chasing after JGL for this envelope."
2,Knockoff!!!,This movie is a joke! the better movie was Quicksilver with Kevin Bacon. Try doing something original! The whole concept of this movie mirrors what Quicksilver did. Pretty pathetic everything has to be a remake.
1,worst joesph gordon levitt eva,"This film was bad, the tone was all over the place light comedy, serious bad cop film, Modern Quicksilver? (Kevin Bacon film) What the F. I usually like Joe Gordon Levitt films, and he is not bad in this but, it just sucks. Micheal Shannon I usually like his films but with the stakes so high for his character in this film his acting makes no sense, it's like he is acting in a different film. It could, should, have been so much better. Big disappointment do not rent, wait till it appears on late nite basic cable if it ever does. And cycling in front of cgi cars is not exciting! This is a bike messenger movie, but not THE bike messenger movie."
1,Not what I expected,"I think bike delivery people in New York are the only ones who would appreciate this movie. I kept on waiting for the good part to start, it never did."
3,Great Actors doing Not great things.,"Levitt and Shannon!! Both are two of my favorite actors and I see academy awards for both within 10 years.Let's put them in an action flick and see what zany and over the top things can happen!Why God Why!!!!Quicksilver.If Quicksilver didn't star Kevin Bacon on a fixie shredding downtown up, then Premium Rush would never have happened.Thank you Kevin."
4,pretty good,"Jacob Gorgon Levett has to many darn names. That a side it was a good movie. Fast paced, a bit over the top to be believable but a good flick."
4,Fulfills within itself,"It was 90's nostalgic for me. A movie that is fun and exciting and doesn't get bigger than its realistic self. Too many movies today try to be too much, this one keeps it simple."
4,Really good adrenaline rush,"There is no mistaking by the title that this will be an action packed movie, but beyond that, it is an enjoyable one as well. I think this is entirely due to Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance. I've always liked him and think he is finally coming into his own as an actor and is truly able to carry a movie as an engaging lead. Great popcorn, Saturday night movie. I really recommend."
4,High action bike messenger movie,"Lots of cycling action, fast paced. Romantic side to the story is kinda weak. Overall worth watching, especially if you are a cyclist."
4,DVD Premium Rush,It was good fast paced. It kept you going through out. It is a keeper. Keeps you interested throughout the whole movie.
2,Meh,Expected more from the talent and director/writer of this very thinly plotted and acted movie set on the streets of Manhattan.
3,Okay is right,"This is basically fast cars, with bikes. Anything to do with the bicycles, and riding them, is complete bs. The rest of the movie was ok."
2,Lame,"Sad waste of talent, it was interesting to learn that messengers develop ""Bullet Time"" skills to avoid being splattered by a truck or splattering a woman with her baby carriage."
2,Not recommended,The movie lack depth and a story line. No acting required. A bicycle chase is a very limited story to tell.
1,bad movie,No plot to speak of..........once you saw one 'bike ride' through Manhattan -you've seen it all.Surprised that JGL would take on such a trivial role.......
1,Bored out of my mind!,"I see good reviews for this movie and opnions do vary depending on peronal taste but I wsa so bored with this movie, kept waiting for it to end!"
5,Rush,This was a great movie. There was tons of action. No boring or slow moments... The acting was also done well.
1,no bike hack,This was a true disappointment. I was so looking forward to a movie with a bit of bike culture in it. Do not waste your money. Instead hit the streets yourself.
4,A Blast For Cyclists,"My favorite bike is a steel frame beater with no gears, and I loved this movie. It won't win any awards but its a fast and furious nail-biter. You know the feel good ending is coming and yet it still maintains its suspense. If you think you'd enjoy watching steel kick some carbon butt, and some NYPD butt, check it out. If you love bikes, you might love this simple, good natured, joyous film too."
3,Good movie!,I know this movie looks kinda dumb but the only reason I wanted to see it was because of JGL I absolutley loved him in Looper! Movie is worth watching! Great actors and has a sence of humor.
3,The quality could have been better.,"The movie in itself was enjoyable. What my primary complaint is about the quality of the picture. I have noticed that when I rented movies from Amazon, the quality was 4 stars. Recently, when renting movies, the movie will start playing, then stops and 'loads'. I can see the quality drop from 4 to 1. I use a Roku box to stream movies. The quality of one star sucks. The movie is blurred and pixelated, the sound is borderline garbled. This issue does not happen when watching Netflix.I think Amazon should look into this issue."
3,Good Movie.,Good movie. Nothing great. Great bicycle riding scenes. Plot is weak. Quality was very good. Something a little bit different from what's out there.
3,Very intense movie!,"Great Movie, we really enjoyed it! My daughter is a huge fan of the main character. And this was another very good performance."
3,Frantic .,I thought it could have had the same outcome in 20 minutes as it did in almost two hours just okay in my book.
2,Dull w/ a Gossamer Plot,"Despite strained efforts at building excitement this was a boring film from start to finish. The plot is poorly conceived, and the character's are one-dimensional stereotypes. As for the plot i ask: Why is the bike messenger required when the woman requesting the delivery ended up at the destination at the same time as the bike messenger? She obviously had plenty of time to take the thing herself. I understand suspending disbelief in drama, but this really tests the viewer's intelligence. That said, if you have 90 minutes to kill on a poorly conceived vehicle for 20 mph action where the biggest looming threat is an opened car door, then by all means spend your $3.99 on Premium Rush."
4,Decent movie,"A decent movie, thats energy packed. Good acting (all the character are in awesome bike riding shape).The lead character is a hottie."
3,Premium Rush,Movie is pretty entertaining. Cycling scenes are a little crazy. I take it there are bike messengers in NY. Some scences are hard to believe but this is Hollywood. I would watch it again.
2,Great movie if made in 1989 and stared one of the Corys,I tried to like this movie because I was very bored and wanted to kill an hour. Well I did. Based on the reviews I really expected something with a bit more... well everything. The acting was painful and uneven. Some of my favorite actors seemed to have a hard time connecting. The action scenes seemed repetitive and awkward. The 6th grade educational video style soundtrack did not help. I just had a hard time buying it... the whole thing. If you enjoy bad movies from the late 80's you may be in luck.
3,Greatt biking but...,Ludicrous plot...they wanted something to need to be delivered and they wanted to have it be difficult...but that was the best they could come up with? Great fun though..bicyclists are awesome. Super good looking cast!
4,good flick,"good stunts, decent plot, good acting, all around fun film. a pleasant night's diversion. Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't get all the accolades he should."
3,"A fun ride, no teeth.","Michael Shannon is great and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good. The dialog and story is pretty cheesy, but overall a pretty fun movie with cool visuals and great chase scenes. Not a lot too remember but the chases and speed of it."
3,It's okay,"It's okay, but the plot felt very thin due to a limited subject and IMHO a weak screenplay. There were moments of very good acting that saves this from being low grade filler"
5,feel the rush,"This movie is an instant favorite, the kind i'll watch many times. It just arrived in the mail today and the story was riveting. I bicycle commute to work daily in dallas, tx so i can somewhat relate to the intense adrenaline moments in this film. Five stars - epic!"
4,very decent,Entertaining start to finish. Joseph Gorden Levitt is a natural actor. Story more interesting than expected wth good action and appropriate humor
3,Pretty good movie,"Different plot and focal point, entertaining and original. I liked the cast and characters as well as the stunts and NYC!"
3,Good Movie,Nothing spectacular about this movie. Enjoyable and worth the $4 I paid to watch. Action was OK and so was the plot.
3,Decent movie. Previews made it look better than it was ....,"The movie was enjoyable, but cheesy. The story line was a little lame and the obsession with the cop and the messenger Wilee was stupid. All-in-All it was an OK movie and a perfect rental."
3,okay,I'm into bicyclying this is good for a 2 hour movie when nothing else is on cable. Not that great of a storyline but doable.
3,Predictable,"Met expectations, based on trailers. Predictable plot. Story did not lend itself to deep character development. Blah, blah, blah, blah"
3,okay,love JGL but this wasn't a great movie for him. The plot seemed to focus entirely on types of bikes which is probably appealing to cyclists but not so much to me.
4,fun on a bicycle.,"This was an above average action flick. The movie unravels a bit at the end, but it was worth the purchase price."
4,Pretty good cycling movie,"This movie had some good cycling scenes, story line was a bit predictable!the acting was good and some innovative ways of filming urban cycling!"
2,Save your dollars,"I was pretty disappointed with this movie. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt's recent successes in movies I was hoping this one would be just as good. Unfortunately it is an extreme let down. This movie seemed like a grown up version of a Disney Channel Original movie. I thought this movie had to deal with some sort of top secret message that could ruin Wall street or something, but instead it is just an envelope of money that a friend needs to get to a lady so she can pay for her son to come from China to America :/ Really, that's the plot....it's so lame. However, the biking parts of the movie were very entertaining; it's not everyday you see a high speed chase on a bike. So if you do end up renting this movie, I suggest that you just watch the whole thing on mute. Believe me you will save yourself a lot of disappointment."
2,Fine for 14 and Under,"I wanted some mindless entertainment one evening. I found it -- with a bonus lame ""love"" story.Some of the cycling scenes were good, but hardly good enough to support this turkey.Jason Gordon-Levitt was compelling in Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. He shows a few glimmers of depth in this movie but given the script, I wouldn't expect much more from Brando.If you need something on during a party, have the flu, or just like ""super bad cool kids versus mean old white bad cops"" flicks, rent this."
3,just okay,"lots of action, simple plot, mildly entertaining, but not recommended if you are counting on a crowd pleaser for the evening"
2,Ok Show,"This is an ok enough show. Nothing great about it, it was ok. I wouldn't say I hated it but it wasn't great"
2,"Cool stunts, no story","When your husband walks out, you know there is a problem. The bike stunts can not save a really lame movie."
2,Okay movie,"I wasn't crazy about the ending. The antagonist was a horrible z-list actor; other than that, the movie was okay."
3,Predictible,Similar story line to many other mivies - exciting and reckless bike riding. I wouldn't buy it for my library - one time view and forgettable.
2,Premium Rush,Here is the deal. My rating might not be fair but I hate violence and rented this to watch with my daughter and son-in-law. She wasn't thrilled either.
3,Good action and fun to watch,"If you don't want to think but want to see a decent movie with some nice action shots, this is it. JGL is good in it but if they picked a better bad guy, that would have improved the movie dramatically. He is terrible."
3,"Great riding, weak plot","It's great to see Hollywood picking up on the fact that people sure seem to like riding bikes these days and also to showcase some of the daredevil moves that define alley-cat racing. All viewers will be impressed by the riding in this movie and a good many of them will be utterly amazed to see what kind of moves can be done on 2 wheels. That said, I found this movie to be pretty weak. Viewers who are interested in seeing some truly incredible riding should check out Lucas Brunelle's alley-cat racing documentary ""Line of Sight"" instead. Don't try this at home, kids."
3,Cool bike riding - okay plot,"The bike riding is the star of this movie and there are some great chase scenes showing cool riding. If you want a movie with a good plot or character development, this isn't it. But if you want a 90 or so minutes of mindless fun, then this will do."
3,It is worth watching when it comes out on net flix,"Don't go out and buy the blue ray. It's worth seeing, but try to watch it for free. It's not worth buying. I rented it on amazon. I wouldn't rent it again. It's just okay."
4,Fits the Bill,"If you are looking for a fast paced action flick, this will work great. If you're expecting more, you will be disappointed, but that's not why you select this movie. Creative cinematography and JGL always delivers."
2,So dumb its stupid.,So a guy is chasing a guy with 40 grand in his bag and he is only getting 50 bucks to deliver. Instead of offering 60 bucks to get the bag from the unknowing guy we have a 1.3 hour bike chase. So dumb its stupid. The person sending the bag could have taken a cab and saved 2 hours of my life.
2,Weak movie,"Bad acting, bad plot... All in all weak... Waste of time. I think my 4 year old could have developed a better story line."
2,HAVE YOU SEEN MY THIGHS?,"Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an underachiever bike messenger in NYC. He has issues with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) who in turn is being evicted by her roommate Nima(Jamie Chung) and she is being hit on by Wilee's work mate Manny (Wolé Parks).Wilee likes to ride and is reckless. Once we get some quick character introductions, Wilee has to pick up a message from Nima...a premium rush, and deliver it in China Town. There is a policeman (Michael Shannon) with a gambling debt that is attempting to intercept the message.The plot is straight forward with no twists. Most of the film is bike riding. The film starts out as a flashback and then gives us flashbacks within the flashback to explain plot points. I was rather bored with the whole film, but this might have a younger audience appeal.Parental guide: 1 F-bomb (why do they do that?), no sex or nudity."
3,Premium Rush,"This was a ""cute"" movie trying to be serious. That's my take on it. You have too much lighthearted to take it seriously. Even the cop, and no I won't spoil it, wasn't that believable. I was actually distracted while trying to watch it. It was fast paced, but in such a way I had a hard time keeping focused on it. Predictable ending. It was okay, but not something I would want to watch again."
4,A good way to spend a few hours,"Good movie. I was enjoying it, for sure. Very fast-paced.Did not slow down much throughout the entire film. I wouldrecommend it. In fact, I have."
4,If you ride you will like this,"Great movie for bicycle enthusiasts. Don't try this at home, you can get hurt. Like Gone in 60 seconds for bicycles."
3,Premium Rush,"Although the storyline was pretty good, I had a hard time following it in the beginning. LOTS of wild bike-riding!"
5,ATomic Octagon Regulator Wall Clock,"Put in the batteries, set the time zone - and it sets the time. It has been keeping time great."
4,Radio-Controlled River City Clock,I like this clock very much. I had a hard time setting the radio-control to my area. I pushed the button and waited a few days but the time was still wrong. I thought I had to send back but gave it one more try. I held the button for about 10 secs or more and the next morning it was set to the correct time and has been working ever since. The pendulum runs from a battery (separate from the clock) and runs a little fast.
5,Atomic Regulator Clock,"I purchased this clock as a wedding present. The recipients were delighted with the clock, both it's appearance and it's feature of the connection with the international atomic clock, so it is always accurate.It made a very nice wedding gift."
2,The clock does not work reliably,"I purchased this clock in October 2010. Once in November the clock just stopped randomly and after pushing buttons in the back I was able to get it to work again. Now, on January 6, 2011, it stopped working again. I put in a fresh battery pressed some buttons and nothing happens. The manual claims it is looking for a radio signal that only comes at night. This clock is not reliable and I don't recommend it.One of the reasons I purchased it was due to a 2 year warranty. Well, to fulfill the warranty I have to mail the clock back to the factory and then enclose $14.95 so they can mail it back to me. One fix is going to cost $30. If I am doing this with a 3 month old clock how many times will I have to do it over 2 years?"
3,Not what I had ordered or saw on display,I asked for and was given a display of a clock with a second hand. When the clock was delivered it has no second hand and the minute hand is approx. 2 minutes off. Don't but River City items.I truly believe Amazon should be more responsible to it's customers.
5,Excellent,This a one of my favorite albums! Sound quality is superb! Songs keep you interested. This guy can really play well.
5,Six stars,"Bromberg's been known mainly for his electric playing in recent years, which is a pity, as he's an absolute MONSTER on the upright. His tone is incredible- that great woody, growl is so think you can taste it- and his interpretation of standards like ""Speak Low"" and ""Dolphin Dance"" puts him up with some of the best. The solos are a treat, too- imagine Miles' ""All Blues"" played as a bass solo! I'm still trying to figure out how he gets two lines moving in different directions like that. Six stars."
5,a GREAT-SOUNDING recording of a master,"This recording was honestly my first exposure to Brian Bromberg, myself being a past jazz pianist. This album should be commended not ONLY for its musicianship, but also for it's clear dedication to high-quality recording. Putting this CD on even a decent stereo system is an excellent way to test for imaging and proper bass. I put this on my system, and I could sense Brian Bromberg standing 2 feet from me, playing his heart out in the beginning of ""Harrison Crabfeathers."" The whole record continued to impress me. All of the musicians on the album have excellent ears for each other, and the interplay is constant throughout the album. On the whole, this record is a musical experience for the stereo audio enthusiast as well as the uninitiated."
2,Boys are bad and girls can't be satisfied...,"I'm engaged and some of the anatomy type explanations were very helpful, that's where the good parts of the book end. As a man reading this book I felt like every stereotype in society about men being sex-animals with no feeling or regard for anyone was pointed out-and agreed with. If my sex drive is higher that's my problem, and I need to fix myself. If our sexual relationship isn't going right it's always the man's fault. On the flip side, my fiance almost cried as she read the book, feeling that being happy with our sex life and finding satisfaction can't ever happen. While I haven't been married yet, I believe this is a false belief, that a wonderful sex life can be achieved. A relationship where each partner is unselfish and aware and sensitive to the needs of their partner. This book did a poor job of giving anyone who's never experienced a sexual relationship, hope of that ever being a unifying, positive experience for both people."
5,For anyone who doesn't know everything about marriage,"As my wife and I have been reading this book together we have found a renewed sense of committment to one another and our marriage. The main focus of the authors is to discuss the importance and role of sexual intimacy in the marriage relationship, but the message is be more about communication between husband and wife and not so much a ""how to"" manual for sex. The book is a wonderful tool for newlyweds and oldlyweds alike who do not already enjoy honest open conversation about their intimacy. The authors handle a sensitive subjuct in a frank and respectful manner, allowing the readers to discuss and discover the details about what feels right and best for them."
2,"Poor, outdated information.","It's hard to imagine a book about intimacy that eschews any frank discussion of sex, is devoid of pictures or even drawings, and ignores biology. As someone who has taught college level classes in this area, this book is full of misinformation and a sexist view of marriage and intimacy. Given the authors' view of marital relations, perhaps this book should be called ""The Job of Sex."""
3,A CD that reminds you of being in church,"When I heard this CD I was transported back to the Baptist Church of my childhood. It really is an uncanny feeling: listening to this recording you can see the congragants, smell the floor polish, feel slightly hungry for Sunday lunch. Still, it must be said that the music itself is very poorly performed. This is, after all, a congretation, not a choir. The effect is either charming or painful, depending on your point of view. Buyer beware."
3,Good Work,"I find a lot of resources in this book to prepare a good emerging service, ideas, images, words, etc. Very useful and interesting. Every pastor shoud have this book as a resource in his office."
5,singalong(ilublucy),i think the vocals are excellent. Everyone in the office is singing along as they are getting to know the CD
4,I've been There,"The lyrics are universal. We've all Hoped for A Miracle, that people would give love a chance. We've all been hurt at some point in our lives and had to survive the pain. I really enjoyed this CD and wish that Pinky Quintana would become a famous songwriter for Celene Dion, Shania Twain, Faith Hill or Jewel!"
2,Music,"I really enjoyed the lyrics of the song and think if it was done by a professional singer, it would be a hit. Singing was awful and who ever put the CD together should be fired for allowing that. The lyrics are beautiful and I would like to see someone such as Shania or Faith sing the song, it would be a hit."
5,Deep album,"Growing up I remember hearing Total Kaos on different albums as a guest usually. He was featured on albums by bass legends such as Prince Raheim, Get Some Crew, and Disco & the City Boyz. This album truly highlights his lyrical skills in a way that make you say ""what the crap...this guy is pretty good"""
3,Springer dropped the ball,"Over all, Verhulst does a ressonable job of conveying the central ideas of the topic. I found it to be slow going for a couple of reasons: First, it's clearly a translation and Springer should have done a better proofreading job ... many of the sentence constructions are unusual for English which is, at the very least, distracting. Second, there are substantial gaps in some of the arguments ... maybe ok for a book at this level, but it often creates considerable frustration.In contrast, the book by Jordan and Smith (Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations) has few flaws and, in my view, should be read first."
5,This book takes you by hand through dynamical systems theory,"What I like more of this work is tha the autor explains all theconcepts he is using, so it is ideal for people who is a naturalscientist but not necesarilly knows all the formalism of modern mathematics. It is not hard to read and covers the basics for study recent research papers. END"
1,This book is not even reasonable,"This book was not written for an student of ODE, he was written to the author himself!This book was used in a course of PhD here in Brazil and the results were very negative. I strongly don't recomend this book... Avoid it..."
3,Paddington... in France!,This is the fourth book in the Paddington series. It didn't disappoint. Paddington was up to his same old adventures. It was just a typical Paddington book except it was set in France.
2,Boring,"The only good scenes that make this movie worthwhile are the bar fight and when one of the 2 main characters blows up the lady villain with a bazooka. That's it. The rest of the movie doesn't get any better than what you see in the first 15 minutes, mainly because all the shoot-em-up scenes get monotonous.And to my surprise, this movie rips off some sequences from Deadly Prey. Not only is it shameful to rip off scenes from a movie that is just as low budget, if not more so, than this movie, but the fact that Deadly Prey is more enjoyable than this is saying a lot. See that one instead. Shoot, the bazooka scene goes the same way.""Bitch!""""Eeaahh!""Boom!It's not the worst low budget movie in the world, but it's definitely not good enough to be worth seeing. Pass."
5,80's Masterpiece,"Jungle Assault is one of those movies that have to be seen to be believed. It's really that good. For fans of low budget action films from the 80's this one can't be missed. It starts in the Jungles of Vietnam and is almost non stop shoot em up action and explosions until the end.The characters are very memorable, especially David Marriot's unforgettable role as Mclusky the Irish mercenary. I think Mclusky alone is worth the price of the movie. I'll tell you this, they don't do movies like this anymore. This movie is no frills, no CGI, no BS, just straight up 80's action, the way it's supposed to be."
5,War Cinema Masterpiece,"Upon seeing Jungle Assault for the first time I recognized it as being a masterpiece of film making. Along with the incredible script and the most realistic combat scenes ever filmed the director manages to paint a cinematic picture that brought tears of joy my eyes, a true Michalangelo of the lens. This film belongs in the lexicon of movie greats."
3,Very small trains-but cute,I bought these trains for my 4 year old son for Christmas. He loves any kind of cars or trains. I was a little disappointed because they are so small. Especially for the money. I have spent less for the bigger Thomas trains and they run on batteries and go. These don't do anything. Which I guess could be good to use their imagination some and you don't have to keep up with replacing batteries.
3,the paint is a bit off,"I got this toy because my two boys always fight about the one they already have so to avoid the conflict I just got them another one. However, when the train arrived the paint on the front had chipped off a bit, so the boys decided this train is broken, so the fight goes on....<sigh>"
1,doesn't fit wooden tracks,"My son, like a lot of preschool boys, is train-obsessed. People know he loves trains and they tend to buy train stuff for him as gifts. We have some Thomas stuff, as well as stuff from some other brands. We have wooden tracks that happen to be from IKEA but are the same form factor as the Thomas and Brio wooden tracks.My advice: be wary of any Thomas stuff that says ""take along."" Henry happens to be my son's only ""take along"" train/engine and he DOESN'T FIT THE WOODEN TRACKS. My son gets very frustrated when he wants to put a train together and he can't use Henry because he doesn't fit. I am completely baffled by why the Thomas people would make two types of such similarly sized trains. But since they did (these are metal mini-collectibles while the wooden ones are, well, wooden), it seems to me it should CLEARLY state on the packaging that these won't work on the wooden tracks."
2,made where?,theese take alongs made in china say compatible with all thomas take alongs... only partly true. The magnet will connect by force but because the magnet is shaped different than the real ones they won't stay lined up proper on the wooden tracks and fall over the edge due to the position.if just using as a toy on the floor or a take with ya somewhere fine.
2,Harmony 688 BAD!!,"This remote is loaded with ideas. Just that. The programers at Harmony actually made the 5 macro buttons (watch TV, watch DVD etc) not work at all. They spent at least 3 hours on the phone with me plus about 4 hours myself on their web - programming page. It will work all my electronics separately, but so will the $29 remote I bought!! The buttons and the LCD are extremely small and hard to use. I would not reccomend this remote at this price."
1,absurd,"James Frey is a great writer whether it was all truth or not. i could also give a hell about what Oprah thinks, I have a mind of my own, which you others should try out for yourselves as well.This book is garbage and a waste of time and I cannot beleive someone is making money off of it. Get a life and write a book that is useful if you really care."
1,I wan't my brain cells back,"It's pathetic that someone wasted their time writing this book to bash A Million Little Pieces. My ex is in prison for meth related crimes and this book has been crucial to his recovery. It has helped our communication, and whether James' story is exaggerated or not, it's one of the best and most helpful books I've ever read and recommend it to everyone. This book however is a complete waste of time and brain cells, and sad that the author makes a living talking trash about others."
1,wow.,this has got to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. everyone should leaves James Frey alone. a million little pieces was a great book. and just because he embellished doesn't make it any less of a great book.
1,lame,"a moving story is a moving story, despite its basis in reality.no need to rip on a book that has actually motivated people and brought some good into the world, in my opinion."
1,distasteful,"this book is not funny, it is not cute and it does nothing to better anyone.i get that it is supposed to be a parody. but make a youtube video, dont write a book about it.james frey is an amazing writer, and his work does not deserve to be criticized like this."
4,very funny,"If you didn't read A Million Little Pieces, this book probably won't make much sense. I found it hilarious. Oh, and by the way...Frey didn't ""embellish.""He lied."
5,"made reading ""a million little pieces"" actually worth it","I read this right on the tail of finishing ""A Million Little Pieces"", the book it parodied.I found the James Frey version waaaay more over the top than this and waaaaay less amusing. THIS BOOK CRACKED ME UP!!"
1,Banal,"From the name of the book to the author's pseudonym, there is nothing original in this book. On top of that, the book is horribly written. It attempts to copy Frey's writing style and utterly fails - because ""Pinocchio"" doesn't understand how parodies or satires work. James simply held A Million Little Pieces up to a mirror and copied everything he saw - and it came out as backwards garbage. He forgets the most basic building block of humor: wit. I would expect satire of this caliber from a C-average high school student.Bottom line: A Million Little Pieces is practically crap, and regurgitated crap is just disgusting."
1,Big lies in big pieces,"It is obvious almost from the beginning that this book is full of big lies. The filthy language and the constant, detailed description of vomiting drove me nuts and made me slightly nauseous. I know enough about Hazeldon to know that organization would not have tolerated the behavior James described. What an ego this man has. I threw it away before I finished it. Shame on you, James Frey. Shame on me for buying this book. What a waste of money."
1,I am garbage,"a horribly misguided attempt at satire. I'm honestly appalled that a publisher would even read this book, let alone pick it up for publication. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,order 1/2 size larger if you buy this shoe and it fits like a glove,As the title states make sure you order 1/2 size larger. I found this shoe to be one of the best I have ever owned. With the choice of 3 insoles you can customize the shoe for max performance and comfort. The only thing that is a little annoying is the shoelaces get stuck to the velcro on the insole strap but it keeps the laces stored when not wearing.
2,not ideal,"pros- you use your own popsicle sticks so you do not need to keep track of ones that come with it.cons- the slots in the lid were not big enough for the popsicle sticks so we had to widen them, the popsicles that were made seemed too big for the stick so a bowl was always needed.we ended up throwing ours out because it was too much work."
3,Ok,"I bought this to make our own natural ice cream bars and popcicles. I do find if you do not use their sticks which are narrower and not as thick as the craft sticks you can buy at the dollar store, it is harder to remove the top, but the cheaper ones do work. Also sometimes the bars will stick so let it sit out on your counter about 10 minutes before trying to remove. All in all you can make your own natural or sugar free treats at a lot less cost. You can go online and find lots of recipes."
3,A-OK,"Does what it's supposed to do. The lid is a bother to removed, it's an absolute necessity to run hot/ warm water over it to seperate from the plastic popsicle molds beneath, but all in all I am pleased with it. If someone comes up with another design, I am in!"
2,difficult to remove the popsicle,"The reason I bought this product is because of its stainless steel top. It looks pretty. But it is difficult to remove the popsicles. When i tried to wiggle the popsicles from the tubes, I unintentional wiggled several of the tubes out of the pop maker. I put them back into their slots and since only a few came loose, there are still several tubes attached to the pop maker allowing it to stand up. I am afraid that if more tubes came loose the pop maker will not be able to stand up. It is not worth the money for a pop maker that will come apart."
3,Okay but not great,I love the actual freezer pops part but HATE the metal lid. The holes for the sticks are too small and so it makes inserting the sticks time consuming and frustrating. I like the Norpro brand lid MUCH bettter
3,difficult to get top off if the sticks are not vertical,"Needs a better way to hold the sticks vertical. I have stopped using it. If you can get longer sticks and leave off the metal top, it would be fine. If the sticks are not vertical, getting the metal top off is difficult. I just run water over the plastic to release them. Disappointed."
3,"Works well, but not dishwasher safe","After using this a few times I put it in the dishwasher, this was probably a bad idea because when I took it out all the metal was a different, darker color which I could 'wipe off.' I'm not sure if it was just oxidizing in the air or something was actually leaching out of the metal. I let it sit for awhile and wiped as much of the color off as I could and it seems to be OK. I don't really want to use it now and will probably buy another to be safe.On the other hand, it works really great and makes popsicles within just a few hours. You can remove them very easily by running warm water over the popsicle you want to remove and then after a few seconds start gently pulling.Highly recommended just don't wash it in the dishwasher."
2,Not happy,Instructions that came with are not clear enough. It is a struggle to remove just one pop. Recipe that came with makes too much fluid
1,Dissapointed,"This product looked like it was going to be cool. I love the shape for popsicles. However, getting them out was a nightmare!If you don't want to pull them all out at once, it's a pain to put the lid back on & store them back in the freezer. Plus I spilled some liquidwhen I first filled the cups. After sitting in the freezer for a week, the metal started reacting with the food....turned black & looked really gross."
1,DO NOT BUY Progressive PLP -1 Freezer Pop Maker,This freezer pop mold is simply a waste of money. Hard to use and the plastic cup gets stuck and breaks when you try and get them out. A definite do not buy!!!
1,metal dust comes off after washing,"AFter one run in the dishwasher, the metal coating of the top part of the product started to rust and black dust started coming off on my fingers. Needless to say, I'm not using it to make popsicles anymore."
1,Total Waste of Money,I purchased this as it was the best selling juice pop maker. The juice pops are nearly impossible to get out of the mold. I spend more time trying to get the juice pops out of the mold as I do eating them. Save your money and sanity and just go buy juice pops at the store.
3,A bit hard to use,"It's adequate but you have to run the hot water persistently because the metal top refreezes if you don't act quickly. I like that it uses sticks, though they sometimes get stuck in the narrow slots. I don't regret buying this item; it's definitely usable."
3,Great Popsicles,"The popsicle maker is made very well, the only part I had a hard time with was getting the sticks through the opening. I think they should be just a little bigger. The frozen pops came out very easily and cleaning is a breeze. All in all, I would recommend the product. It would be a very accomodating if there were a few recipes included with the maker. It is always nice to have extra ideas."
5,Great Product!!!,"Bought this for Hubby's birthday. He loves this.......making lots of popsicles........so far orange creamsicles. But I also bought him the popsicle book wiht loads of receipes. Can't wait to try them out. And yes, like another reviewer had stated, it is best to wait at least an hour or more before inserting the sticks into the mold so they don't slip sidewaysWould recommend this to anyone who likes a cool treat, but at a fraction of the price of store bought ones!"
1,This is the most annoying book I have ever read,"This is my most hated book I have ever read, bar none. And I have read a lot of books. I've never been so annoyed while reading a book. Supposedly a pleasurable activity. I was actually rooting for Tibbie to go back with the former lover who impregnated and abandoned her. She'd be better off with him than with Nick. What a clod. All he had to say was ""I love you, will you marry me?"" and the book would have ended at the halfway point. BUT NO. She had to tell him she loved him, FIRST. Why is he so insistent? When he knows all she's been through before with her former lover? It doesn't make any sense except that the author had no plot. If you read this book you will be wasting your time and money. I simply can't say enough bad things about it, as I don't have my thesaurus handy."
3,A Near Miss,"This isn't a bad book, and with some heavy editing, it could've been a very good book. As other reviews have noted, it starts off extremely well, but then slumps into a very, very lengthy lull. The novel is excellent until somewhere around page 200 or 250, and then the plot slows to a crawl and doesn't pick up again until roughly page 450 or 500. And the ending felt rather weak to me, but perhaps if that ending had come in perhaps 300 to 350 pages rather than over 600, I wouldn't have felt somewhat disappointed. The journal and letter format -- a clever tribute to the style of Bram Stoker's original ""Dracula"" -- served as something of a reminder that most folks' journals and letters could use a bit of trimming to keep them from becoming dull and repetitive."
3,"Promising start, fizzling finish...maybe next time.","As a vampire-lore buff, I was really looking forward to this book, which promised to be a refreshing departure from the usual romantic gothic pulp stories. And it IS different, in a good way. It begins well: interesting premis, creepy scenes, great sense of suspense. I got hooked and read avidly. But then... somewhere in the middle, the author over-does the history lesson (midieval monks in Europe for how many pages?...zzzz) and the characters never really change or show more than two-dimensions. But the real let-down is the boring ending... After all that build up. Dracula has the most uninspired entrance imaginable, and the final resolution is dull as well. Even if there were a sequel, I wouldn't be in a hurry to read it."
1,Seriously overhyped,"This was one of the most monotonous, self-conciously overwritten books I've ever read. It was so boring that I had to drag myself kicking and screaming through the first few chapters until I could read no more. It's the kind of book where you keep waiting to get to 'the good part' which is no kind of book at all. Waste of money."
2,"Is this a novel, or the author's massive research results ?","Jeez, I hate to say it, but, I could not finish this book. It's obvious the author did her research for this exhaustive novel, and, she wants you to know it. And know it. And know it. I made it to page 215, and realized that somewhere in this mountain of babbling, there was actually an interesting but suffocated story trying to get out. I don't have a short attention span, nor do I mind long winded descriptives, but after page 215, I just couldn't take this particular tidal wave of words anymore, especially since I discovered every page could have easily been written with half the words, with the same, if not better, effect. I applaud the author for her success, but, I would also suggest for her to write her next novel with more story and less lectures and lessons on her personal researches."
1,Waste,"The one star this book deserves comes from the fact that it proves having a Master of Fine Arts doesn't make you a good author. 600 pages of going to library after library throughout Europe in the attempt to find Dracula's tomb is not worth the ending that it brings. Kostova writes beautifully, but the book could have been written in 100 pages. Long doesn't always mean good."
3,"Oh, such mixed feelings...","I love vampire literature, and I enjoyed the history and geography presented in this book. The premise was interesting and I appreciated the 'father writing letters to his daughter' format. However, the ending just killed it. Dracula was looking for a librarian? Really? I almost laughed out loud, except that I was so mad that the ending was so incredibly lame. Someone should have told him to take an ad out on Craig's List, LOL. I can only assume the author was on a deadline and didn't have time to come up with anything better."
2,Phfffft,"Would anyone like to buy a slightly used hard-back book? (Not going to be one added to my permanent collection.) It was like reading a text book in a subject you didn't like much. Slow, pedantic and way way too long. The characters were blah and the action non-existent. Reading this book was several hours of my life I want back!"
4,Very good but a bit too long,"I enjoyed this book and think it could have been 5 stars if it had been a bit shorter. In addition to being good historical fiction, it is a great travel book. The writing was excellent and the plot was interesting. I do recommend this book."
2,slow padded travelogue,"The book started out fine, and I was entertained with the story, and lovely traveling with her father. The story switched back and forth between the father's past story he is telling his daughter, then switches to the present story of them traveling. Unfortunately, the story doesn't seem to ramp up, and drops into a padded travelog with too little happening of any interest. 100 pages needs to go to speed this story up, and frankly I no longer care. I got to page 243 and stopped reading. I no longer care, I feel manipulated and bored. Anybody want to buy my book, because I don't care if Vlad chews on them all."
3,Vampire librarians?,"I am astounded that such a tedious book has gained so much hype in the publishing industry. It starts very well, with a chilling creepiness and tension very reminiscent of Stoker, but it manages to lapse into a long-winded travelogue of Eastern Europe with an excess of dead-end characters and convoluted plot lines. Somehow, vampire librarians are not an effective horror device, even to a bookish geek like me. It does have it charm in spots, and is worth reading for one outstanding character, but I am puzzled by the hype."
3,Needs a good editor,"I'm approximately half way through this book and struggling to finish it. As one reviewer described, none of the narrators have their own voice or seem to be connected to any particular time period. But a couple of things interested me as oversights by the editor. On page 123 ""father"" calls the mysterious lady ""Ms. Rossi"" on page 125 he finds out the mystereous lady is named Ms. Rossi. whoops.On page 189 Turgut is described as having a silver mustache and a mane of silver hair and on 208-209 the same man is described as having curly dark hair slicked back. whoops.Maybe I need to finish reading this overly rated book and see if there are explanations for these descrepencies before I question them."
1,Book without a soul,"I wanted to like it but while Kostova can write she's not a writer. She can turn a phrase but they have no meaning. She can construct characters but they have no soul (no pun intended). Her scenery is vivid but not at all interesting.Kostova has indeed put a new twist on the Vampire legend, she has made it boring.The only positive thing I can say is I bought it for $3.95 from the bargain bin. Now only if I can get those hours of reading back."
2,Why the hype?,"This was an ambitious book that seemed at first to justify the breathless reviews. A third of the way through, I realized that it would a chore to finish. And it was. It devolved into another drawn out vampire story with all the improbable history and invevitable final show-down. I was looking for another book equal to the one I'd recently finished -- ""The Shadow of the Wind."" This wasn't it."
2,This Dracula Sucks,"I just finished this book. And I don't want to give away any of the plot, but... In all honesty, I was let down.Another reviewer mentioned how the first 300 pages go by so quickly and the story is very engrossing -- It's true. The book really takes off in the beginning, but then it pretty much hits a brick wall. Was it really necessary for this novel to be 700 pages? No.I got very wrapped up in the characters and the storytelling from the beginning, but I would not recommend this book to someone else. I finished it solely because I was hoping to resolve Kostova's great set-up. Didn't happen.I was also highly annoyed that there was such care and detail put into the book -- I don't think it's a stretch to say her writing is, at times, ""wordy"" -- yet, the climax is literally 1 1/2 pages. Booo!This book about Dracula just sucked up my time. I had to force myself to finish it. Disappointed."
1,"If Drakula is undead and reads this book, he will die of boredom.","I found the beginning of this book engaging and engrossing; the ending was boring and banal. Your time would be better spent reading Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" or visiting www.donlinke.com/drakula/vlad.htm."
2,The Only Horror Is My Paying for the Hardback,"Let me preface this review by telling you that I haven't finished reading The Historian. How dare I commit - and admit - this sacrilege? My answer: I cannot allow another reader to struggle knowingly through this boring tome. Based on a thoughtful, enthusiastic review in a respected publication, I rushed to the bookseller. (I seldom do this; I wait for recommendations from trusted friends.)I was enticed by the concept of combining history and horror genres. Although the opening chapters didn't grab me, Kostova's character creation,descriptive settings and artful use of language encouraged me to pursue a so very slowly developed storyline. The obvious in-depth research earned it another star. Unlike many readers I will not compare the author or the book to another: I was prepared for it to be different than early Ann Rice,L. A. Banks, et al. I'm on page 36. I can not go further."
2,A real page turner ... when you skim,"I had high expectations for this book. I was thinking it would be something like Anne Rice's The Witching Hour, which is one of my favorites. However, it fell far short of that standard. Rice wrote a novel that also crossed centuries in scope, but filled that time with a very rich and intricate history that was revealed generously throughout the novel. The revealed history in Kosovo's book could fill a single chapter, but she parses it out in drips. Hard to stay interested at that pace.One tip that may help is skimming. Especially in book one where Kostova fills up volume with a contrivance that advances the real story in every other chapter. The alternate chapters (a travelogue) can be skipped with no consequence. Very easy for a reader to pick up on. This would be a very easy book to make into an abridged audio book. It might even be an improvement."
2,Predictable and dry,"This story starts out with a lot of promise. The premise is intriguing as the search for Dracula begins after a prominent professor goes missing. However, despite all the author's attempts at trying to make a suspensful novel, everything ended up being so predictable. The pace of the book is excruciatingly slow, and at times, I felt as though I was reading a textbook on Eastern European history rather than an exciting mystery. I actually fell asleep several times while trying to get through some very verbose and boring history which ended up leading nowhere.This book was not worth reading, the climax is painfully predictable and unclever. Save yourself the trouble and re-read the Da Vinci Code."
1,Painfully Boring,"SPOILER ALERT---- Having read that Kostova spent the better part of a decade in a library researching this book, I can understand why all of the novel's climactic scenes occur in a library. Terror at the circulation desk! The book should have been called The Librarian. It's clear after 95 pages that Kostova couldn't fathom the imaginative skill to create compelling settings outside of her Fodors-esque descriptions of Europe. Or maybe after the two-hundredth consecutive week of sitting in reading rooms she was struck with a fantasy that her colleagues were more than what they seemed. ""Hey, maybe they're all vampires...wait, I can use that in my book."" Better yet, Dracula is searching for a librarian to tend to his library...this being the book's climax. That's right. A librarian. I imagine the large chunk of change Kostova's publisher threw at her means she'll be coming out with a second book. Let's hope she uses the money to do the research in a more interesting setting."
1,I Beg To Differ,"I read every page of this bloody (no pun intended) book and cannot conceive what all the hype was about. The novel reads like a cross between a Ph.D. thesis on medieval eastern Europe and a travel guide through the Balkans. The characters are stereotypes: the vaguely absentminded professor, the emotionally impaired father-deprived woman and a vanilla teen-age girl who is merely a device for propelling the story through time. When Dracula finally makes his appearance he comes off as a fey, boorish Oscar Wilde. If you want to read about eastern Europe, I suggest The Assault by Harry Mulisch. If you want a good vampire story then it is Salem's Lot by Stephen King. In the meantime, The Historian get a silver spike through the spine."
2,OVERRATED!!,"This book started out with so much potential! I was hooked....until she NEVER stopped describing scenery and never allowed anything of real substance to ever happen. What is the plot???...BORING!!!! So, overrated!!!! If you love lots of detail....this is the book for you!!"
4,"Great story, bummer ending.","The HIstorian is a wonderful tale that spans time and space in the search for the elusive Vlad the impaler. This novel binds geography, history, fact and ficton together for a trip all over the world and in and out of years. This book is a page turner often keeping you up late at night looking for a stopping point. The only thing that makes me give the book 4 stars, is the ending. Without giving it away, I think the ending was sort of anticlimatic. We spent all that time looking all over for Vlad and then the ending doesn't give the reader a sense of resolution. If it were a 2 1/2 hour movie, the climax and alleged resolution would take 2 minutes. Other than that the book is a great novel and I am looking forward to Kostova's next novel. Maybe we will learn about the origin of witches and their current role in society today? :)"
2,"There is no ""bite"" here - just history","I echo the remarks of a recent reviewer - up to about mid-point of the book it keeps my attention with action and what is next. At about 300 pages it turns into a complete history lesson. From the description of the book, I thought there would be more interaction with the vampire world. I skimmed the last half of the book and was disappointed. The only part of Dracula is the legend and historical references. For those who like more ""spooky"" to their stories, this doesn't deliver. This book is more for those who like highly detailed history and legends."
2,So boring.,"I don't recommend this book to anyone except Dracula fans. The writing is so ridiculously coy and transparent (""I must pause here, brave reader. I cannot bring myself to write anymore for the moment."") Give me a break. All of this wouldn't be so bad if the writer actually delivered on her attempts to build suspense (which she doesn't). I read constantly but I don't usually write reviews. However, the hype made for this book has been so overly inflated that I had to say something."
2,boooorrrring,"I was so disappointed with this book after all the hype and publicity the author received from varying reviews as the Costco Magazine to NY Times Book Review.I found the multi-layers of characters and time changes distracting...I sometimes lost track of who was telling the tale.I didn't feel empathy for any of the characters - they all seemed cold and remote.I disgarded my rule of ""if you're not hooked in 50 pages - forget it!"" and plowed through the 500 plus pages - sometimes leaving the book for days without any urge to pick up the story again."
2,slap me when it's over,"this is a boring read for me. too much revelry in describing everything and i mean everything. no shortage of new characters. they come and go one after another. i just wanted to get to Dracula! pacing leaves a lot to be desired. mid-read, i skipped pages when there's no action going on (believe me, still describing and describing....on and on and on....) and headed for the climax. guess what? did not miss a thing."
2,If I knew then what I know now...,"I am half way through this long laborious read and can't give up now. Just because I am hooked on the plot and want to know how it all ends doesn't mean that this book is a good read. Where was the author's editor? This book could have been cut in half, which would have resulted in a much more quick paced experience. There are two different stories going on here (or is it 3), both of which are written in the first person...I think. At some points I found it hard to follow the switching back and forth between the stories. The plot involves to many coincidences and I womnder why the vampire(s) just didn't kill all the people snooping into his/their ""life"". All I can say is I hope the next 200 page investment is worth it."
2,"Payoff was pretty good, but it was a slow trip","By and large, this book was the very definition of a ""slog"". While there is no denying that it takes talent to interweave this many overlapping stories for over 642 pages without tripping over one's own feet, the fact that it was done primarily via letters written by the characters began to wear quite heavily on my patience. In fact, by about page 400, I could no longer feel my feet. Fortunately, at about page 500 or so, the climax of the book finally (and not without some page-turning tension) comes into view. Look, technically this novel is mighty fine. I just tend to need a bit more juice along the way. If you're looking for page-by-page, white-knuckle terror, skip this. Or, just read the flap, then turn to page 500 & read a spooky 142-page thriller."
2,"Interesting concept, poor pacing/storytelling","I like the idea of this book, but Kostova really needed a better editor. I understand what she was going for, but there were many parts of the book that sacrificed storytelling for atmosphere, and storytelling for dissertations on monks and sultans. Also, all of the love stories in the novel are really trite and forced."
3,A Bit Above Average,"This book is a publishing phenomenon, but not necessarily in a good way. Its on the NYT Bestseller List and was the beneficiary of a major PR campaign at the time of publication, something quite unusual for a debut novel. It is not, however, a particularly good book. The author deserves quite a bit of credit for ambition. The plot is complicated, features several important characters, and cuts across no less than 3 time periods. The basic device of dramatizing historical scholarship, the discovery and interpretation of old documents, is clever. The quality of writing and plotting is competent as opposed to good, and characterization is relatively weak. For a first novel, The Historian is actually pretty good but falls well short of being a good read."
2,Big Disappointment,"while the author has an amazing style in her prose, the storyline is dragged for most of the book. this book really needed to be edited and the fact was it was not. About half of the text could have been cut, leaving the storyline, which has a horrible, very dissappointing ending.forget this one!!!!!"
3,Much to much detail,"This book (in hardcover) is 642 pages. That is at least 192 pages to long. The reason is the author goes into much to much detail. I don't think we need to know everything about every room somebody goes into, or know the national drink of every country visited.The plot is fine, some good ideas there, but it is a tough book to make it through due to the mind numbing details.The author uses three and sometimes four different time lines and all are told in the first person - so you must pay attention to make sure you have your brain reading it in the correct decade of the 20th century. She goes a bit overboard on this technique, for my tastes."
4,Great read but way too long...,"I really enjoyed this book, but at times it was in spite of the ponderous middle to last sections. The Istanbul section became very repetitive and the entire Bulgaria section was superfluous. How many endless meetings with academics are needed to impart tiny bits of information?However, on the whole, this is an excellent read."
3,Slow but Educational,I learned a lot about history from this book. Some of the past atrocities committed by rulers makes Saddam look compassionate. The book is well written inthat it weaves stories of different generations together to make an intriquing tale. The pace was slow but picked up toward the end.
4,Beautifully written but flawed,"I absolutely loved the first 500 pages of this book. I finally had to start using it as a ""reward"". I would wash the dishes, and then read 3 chapters, then I would put some laundry in the wash and read 2 chapters. I gave myself a full 100 pages if I managed to go to work and not call in sick to read. But even as much as I loved the beautiful writing and suspenseful chapter endings, I found that the Dracula character was boring and somewhat confusing (why did he send out the books if he didn't' want to be found?). You expect a character like that to be EVIL and he turns out to be a bloodsucking bibliophile. I was a bit disappointed in that. I finished the book two weeks ago and I still think of it, so all in all I recommend it. It is written in very high level English, so if your vocabulary skills are lacking, you might get frustrated. If you like a challenge and love words, then this is a great book."
2,A Pedestrian Scenic Tour of Southeast Europe,"This would be an excellent vehicle with which to teach a college-level course in expository/descriptive writing.It is overloaded with scene description,however well done.Consider it a hardcover edition of a ""James Fitzpatrick Travelogue""Not much of a detective story."
3,"Good idea for a story, could have cut 200 pages","The book has a great idea for a story, but the author tends to go on and on with too much description...I felt the whole book could have been cut down by about 200 pages..."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"The book started off brightly, keeping me engrossed although somehow its plot promises always seemed to fall short. The biggest disappointment came at the end, however. After building up such an impressive and menacing evil presence, it all ends with a clumsy attempt at a football tackle and a gunshot? And that's how DRACULA, the great evil throughout 500 years dies? Silly, if anything else."
3,Like listening to a cover band,"Although there is alot commendably absorbing in this novel,it never really has the same dramatic effect as the classic it came from. In fact, reading this book is sort of like listening to a good cover band - it's entertaining but not as emotionally charging as listening to the original band perform there song. Also, the book ends abruptly after endless buildup. A good read, but I felt like there was something missing after completion."
4,Great book - but watch out for SPOILERS in other reviews!!!,"The Historian ranks high in historical fiction, with incredible attention to accurate detail about European history, and many compelling characters. Perhaps not as action packed as The Da Vinci Code, this novel is smarter and better researched. Anyone who enjoys learning while being entertained by a work of fiction will enjoy this book.Please beware of some other reviews, which will spoil the ending of the book. Whether that ending seems ""logical"" or not (as one reviewer debates) should be left to the reader to determine. Reading fiction (particularly a book that purports to tell the history of Dracula and includes several undead characters) requires a willing suspension of disbelief. Those who are unable to allow themselves to enter a fantasy world should stick with the Wall Street Journal."
2,Needs Editing,I read this book because a friend highly recommended it. Parts of this book were a good read and I found myself really enjoying sections of the book but then dragging through the rest. If they had edited out about 200-300 pages of this book it would have been better.If you are really into history you may really enjoy it but I found it rather dull.
1,I did not like this book,"I am an avid reader of books of all genres, and this book is one of the few that I would not recommend to many people. The basic plot line was mildly interesting, but the character development left a great deal to be desired. I really tried to give this book a chance, but in the end I had to force myself to finish reading more out of a sense of accomplishment than any real connection to the story or the characters."
2,One of most over-hyped recent books I've read,"Being both a history and fiction fan, the title of this book alone attracted me. When I learned it had to do with Dracula, it attracted me even more. I just finished reading it and what a disappointment it was. First, this book is too long by some 200-250 pages. By the time I got to the end, I had forgotten how the whole thing started. The going back and forth between letters and present and more letters was interesting at the beginning but just grew cumbersome. I realize this is fiction, but the best works of fiction (in my opinion) are those with stories that are so well-developed that they could be real. Not that I'd believe Dracula is around somewhere, but the coincidences and ""chance meetings"" that occur in this book are just plain cheesy.You want to be gripped, spooked out of your wits and sleep with the lights on? Read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula""."
2,Literature This Isn't,"Literature this isn't. (I put it down twice as ""unable to finish"") No discernable plot. Rather paste board characters. No real action. Part travelogue (Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania in the 1930s-70), part mystery (do vampires still live?), part romance it's simply too long, too convoluted (multiple narrators) and, frankly, somewhat immature. I thought it needed several applications of an editor's red pencil and better judgment and was surprised Little Brown published it; but I guess they knew what they were doing because it has been a big hit. As this is written I note Ms Kostova has a new novel just out and I wish her well. Just hope she's learned to write with greater brevity and better story telling skill."
1,"weak writing, weak history lesson","On the bright side, I did not spend money on this book, it was given to me as a present. The writing is really poor, and one cringes at some of the dialogues. The characters have no depth and the story relies on too many coincidences to make sense. Peppered with Eastern European names and expressions, the book is nonetheless little researched in depth, and while the author might know some Slavic languages, she is not really familiar with Romanian or Hungarian. These are, still, forgivable sins. The main problem is that the book is boring. While Angels and Demons, which is the closest I came to this genre, is fast paced and entertaining, the Historian crawls at a painful pace, beating the long dead horse of the Vlad Tepes, the vampire. Nothing original there. I am reading right now the Queen of the South, by the guy who wrote the Club Dumas, and these are books are truly recommend."
2,Yawn!,"It's obviously just me, but I found this book to be an exercise in drudgery. I was painfully aware of all the research that Miss Kostova must have done to fill the 600+ pages - editor, where were you? Normally, I'll read a book in 2-3 days, sometimes less - this baby took me close to 5 weeks! And for what? After thousands of miles are traveled, countless people are interviewed, holy place after holy place is visited, searching, searching, searching - what do we get? The worst anti-climactic ending I have read in a long time - and then a pointless epilogue stuck on for - I don't know what for. Where was the drama, the suspense, the tension, all the necessary ingredients that make a great novel? Come back, Ann Rice - and quickly!"
1,Major hype=one deadly dull vampire tale,"It started out with promise, and with all those fantastic reviews, how could anyone not enjoy this book? ...I'm now heartened to read that many other reviewers found this book tedious and horrendously edited, with wooden, indistinguishable characters and zero payoff for slogging through Ms. Kostova's pedantic goulash. I literally contemplated putting the book down for good at the childishly-described ""climax"" nearing page 600, but forced myself on, wagering there must be SOME pay off...well, I'm going to go ahead and ruin the ending for you just in case you too are wondering if the next 300 pages will be worth the effort: Don't bother! There are no cool twists or big surprises. It's all just one big, fat, boring tome."
3,A Long Road to Nowhere,"This facinating book tells a long but interesting story in the form of narative, journals, diary entries, secret letters and obscure research. What more could one ask for? Well... a good ending would have been nice. Anything/something would have made it all worthwhile. Unfortunately, the book fizzles out and I dropped it with disgust upon completion. Not recomended. Let's hope with her next effort she get an editor with the sense to tell her when and if she again drops the ball. Ms. Kostova has talent - it would be a shame to see it wasted again."
2,Period read about Dracula.,"Two daughters search for their fathers. A man searches for his Professor and his wife, who he believed were dead. Each search happens in a different time and place, but each storyline blends and intertwines to form a cohesive tale involving the very evil Vlad (AKA Dracula, the Conqueror or Vlad the Impaler). As each sets out on their journey to discover the truth, they eventually tell us a little about Vlad lure and history, all revealed thru letters and flashbacks.I will not say that ""The Historian"" was the most engrossing vampire read, but it was definitely not the worse. I thought the imagery and attempt at suspense building was ok, but it wasn't ""can't put it down good""..instead it was definitely a slow, methodical process to reveal a truth that you always knew or suspected. If you need something historical, with a slight twist on the vamp theme (Dracula wants a library), then you'll enjoy it."
5,Not Your Usual Vampire Tale,"I read this book for a graduate level class in Gothic Literature. Even though it is a long book, it is a novel you don't want to put down. It looks at three time periods of a search for Vlad Dracula. It has great description of enchanting Eastern European settings. It has a lot of history, but has adventure as in Dan Brown's novels. Mrs. Kostova did a superb job of creating a riveting first novel. I highly recommend this book for those liking well written historical novels, with a touch of legend and vampirism.It helped having read the Bram Stoker Dracula, but is not necessary. No violence or profanity, but good development of searching and adventure."
2,Good story but too much padding,"I bought this book because I love history and the premise caught my imagination. I'm not a vampire story reader and this story didn't hit you over the head with that. It is just a part of the total story. I love the use of the different perspectives, the story told through people and time, I just couldn't get past the wordiness of the whole thing.I have no problem with long books,I am a big fan of Edward Rutherford but the story was just too descriptive places for my taste.I rarely give up on a book, I want to give them every chance to win me over, to seduce me into finishing the story.However I only got about 25 % through and had to stop. I may go back to it but it just became burdensome to plow through the ""color"" to get to the story. Frankly I started to skip and skim and that is a bad sign.Maybe I will go back to it and find out the who and where of the mystery but for now I will let it RIP."
2,Who was telling the story?,"The book is written in the first person, done by the daughter AND father, one never knows which one is doing the telling. It jumps to too many time eras. It probably is well written for a ""first write"" but it didn't ""grab"" me. I don't think there was any suspense at all, it was more like a geography narrative."
5,Excellent Read!,"I picked this book up after reading the original Dracula (with Elizabeth Kostova's introduction). I would recommend reading Dracula first, however it's not necessary to do so to enjoy this novel. I enjoyed the Historian from the start - her attention to detail was striking. Although there are a lot of characters in the story, you don't get bogged down trying to figure out who is who. You'll also note that she wrote in a similar style to Bram Stoker - the novel is in journal/letter form, and the fictional author only provides brief narratives. However, her story is so unique that I did not feel like I was reading a rehashed Dracula story. Well worth the time!"
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was very excited to read this book and for the most part am content with it. I did not think it was boring or slow as many reviewers are writing. To me it seemed to grab me with suspense whenever I wasn't expecting it. It definitely had me wanting to read to the end, which is where I was not really satisfied. The book is quite long, but in a page the whole story is wrapped up and I was left feeling disappointed. Overall the writing and history etc. is excellent and I'm glad I read it."
1,"The next Da Vinci Code? Oh, puh-leese!!","I bought this book after much media hype - in fact, I pre-ordered it. Touted to be the next Da Vinci Code, the book promises to be a compelling search for Dracula himself. It was more like a historic travelogue about the Eastern Bloc. The research must have been painstaking, but the final product - this book - has been categorized wrong. It should have been categorized under Ancient/Historic Eastern Europe. The Count, in this book, was reduced to being a mere portrait, a collector of books in search of a librarian!People who are thinking of buying this book as an equal to The Da Vinci Code, please don't. If you are a historian or a history student or even an architecture major, buy it - not otherwise.Sorry, Ms Kostova, but the media hype around your book was completely misplaced."
2,the historian,"I will be short. If anyone out there is fascinated by a history in general read this book.I felt like I lived it.I can not say I am 100% sure it is all accurate , it is a fiction in the end but it has to have a lot of a true research in it that real reader always appreciates in the end.Thanks to the author."
4,Engrossing,"This is a very enjoyable read -- not to be taken too seriously, but just great fun. It is well written and kept my interest from the start. What more could you ask of a book? All ""Dracula lovers"" should enjoy it, but it is primarily a detective story and a good one at that."
3,Too academic but a good read,"Reading this book, I felt like I was supposed to be a historian myself. Some of the documents incorporated are very dry and boring that I actually skipped over a lot of it. Much could have been summarized. After all, the context in which they are given are supposed to be letters to someone. I felt there were too many layers of letters and documents within letters, etc. As one reader wrote, I sometimes lost track of who was telling the story.The cumberness of the storytelling aside, I enjoyed the plot and twists, even though it was mostly predictable. It was an OK read if you like vampire lore."
5,The Historian,"Do you ever the feel as if some books, once opened, keept calling you back? If yes, you will relate to The Historian.As a vampire book there are better blood-sucking stories out there, with more action, and more vivid characters. This story is quiet, like Rebecca. Kostova trasports you from place to place on quest for the real Dracula. The horror of it all just kind of hits you in a quiet, subtle way, instead of over-your-head like contemporary, action-packed thrillers."
1,I hate to do this,"I hate to do this! That is write a bad review and put the book down before finishing and move on to another book. But I am doing it with the Historian. It is boring. I am more than 200 pages in to it and it has not grabbed me. Tuesday I have a long flight from Boston to Vegas. I need a book that will hold my attention as I sit in the giant steel tube at 30,000 feet for a ponderous 5 hour flight. The Historian is equally ponderous. How many times can the main characters run from library to library reading about Dracula. Reading the Historian is reading about a bunch of people reading about Dracula. Additionally it lacks the slighest bit of humor. The main characters the little girl and her wimpy father are boring. The father should be brought up on child endangerment charges. The author should be brought up on reader endangerment charges as she has put my lifelong love of books in danger.Rent the 1931 Bela Lugosi classic film Dracula. It is more fun and scary than the Historian."
1,How can you make a vampire book boring???,"Kostova has done the impossible--she's managed to make a vampire book that'll put you to sleep. Her research is remarkable, however, her narrative abilities fall far short. The tale progresses at a herky-jerky pace which does not mirror the story line--i.e., Oh no! There's a vampire! He's going to kill us! Lets...sit...down...and...read...a...book...and...talk...about it...for two...hundred...pages...I plowed through several hundred pages, hoping that the forgettable, lackluster characters would actually do something worthwhile. I should've reread Bram Stoker's classic instead.All in all, Kostova is like an aged scholar--quick to show off her prodigious learning, while the entire class drools upon their desks in sheer boredom."
1,Terribly written,"I couldn't make it past the first hundred pages. The writing is very clunky. It reads as if she were writing with a thesaurus in hand. So many of her word choices, especially her adjectives, are just not quite right. It's as if she doesn't 'quite' know what the words mean, and is trying to sound literary. And the conceit of presenting overly-complicated prose as if it were a story told by a father to a daughter, or in a letter, just doesn't work. No one talks to someone else as if they were the narrator of a novel."
3,I finished reading it!,"The feel of this book is exceptional. The touch of the paper is comfortable, and the typeface is pleasant. I truly enjoyed holding this book. It seemed like an old friend. But like an old friend it was sometimes tiresome and tedious. The story is a good one, and it's a bit of a twist on the run of the mill vampire saga. When reading a fantasy, one expects the implausible. But this story went a bit far with its fanciful coincidences. (Of all the people on the planet, how incredible that our central character encounter so many who had received the same book as he?) I'm glad I read this book, but at times it was a bit of a chore."
2,Great Idea Poorly Executed,"What a great idea!! Dracula is alive in 'real time'. None of this 14th Century stuff, what's he like NOW. Unfortunately, he was in the such an icredibly brief time, like 3 pages, and you have to plow thru so much to get there, I felt cheated. I was really looking forward to the meeting with Dracula, what a disappointment."
2,Needed a good editor...,"I wanted to like this book but found it impossible. The story was dry, the characters boring, and it was wordy without saying much. It could only have been improved by some judicious editing, maybe 300 pages worth. As a reader who has enjoyed everything from Dickens to the DaVinci Code, I found ""The Historian"" to be another highly touted book that fails miserably to live up to the hype."
3,Just couldn't get through it,"I couldn't wait to read this book after I heard of it, so perhaps my expectations were too high. It has some great qualities - great description, through research, and many exciting moments, especially the ending. But I want well developed characters and a plot that moves along, and description and facts that complement the action and characterization, not take over the book. Also, there were aspects that just weren't logical. SPOILER ALERT! I don't buy why Helen leaves her family and why it takes her husband so long to search for her, although perhaps because it was before the days of computers. The daughter is an interesting and important part of the first part of the book, and then becomes very secondary.Perhaps a good editor would give this excellent author some balance and perspective."
2,So you know what you're getting into...,"I wouldn't normally go out of my way to critique a book, but this one is so long, I think it only fair to warn readers of what they will get for their investment. Kostova obviously put a lot of work into this novel and tried to be ambitious. But it is not particularly well written nor gripping. The character's motivations are implausible -- particularly when Helen gets her say. I worked my way through, hoping after page 300 for a payoff on the time I had already spent. Unfortunately, I never found it. If you want an idle read, this is fine. If you're looking for a great book, look elsewhere."
2,Don't bother....,"Oh wow, this was a big waste of time. EK hardly needed the enormous amount of pages to tell such an anti-climatic, hard-to-believe story. Yes, there was the Eastern European history and some compelling travel descriptions that made me perk up every once in a while but they hardly prop this book up. EK was overly descriptive to the point where we are given the most inane details about ""stuff"" (no better word that!) that doesn't contribute to the plot, the story or the characters. It was as though she couldn't get beyond her 9th grade English teacher's instruction to ""be as descriptive as possible."" She took this to the extreme. I could go on, but I don't feel like wasting any more time on this book than I already have."
2,The Historian,I dont understand what all the hype is about. I found the book fairly tedious and stilted because it is just too long. At times the author was able to produce some suspense but there is too much unnecessary description which made it hard to get into the two parallel stories which take place a generation apart of a professor and his student which at times held my interest.
2,Utterly Predictable.,"Kostova's debut novel slides into the history of the infamous Dracula. She certainly proves that her skill at research is commendable and her writing style is original. However, the book is too long to thoroughly enjoy. The story is easy to follow because it is utterly predictable. The novel's narrator is hauntingly similar to the woman in The Da Vinci Code. The reader will feel as though they have read the book once before or at least seen too many trailors for the movie. Kostova reportedly received a $2 million dollar advance for the book which is why the huge hardcover sits at the front of every bookstore in a large display area. It may make a decent movie, but did not make the cut for this summer's must reads."
3,Starts strong then goes wrong...,"What a killer great start. I thought I was in for a really good read here. For about 300 pages I was right there. But then just about half way through, things slow down in a serious way. It's pretty disappointing considering the pace of the first half of the book. It gets pretty campy at the end. Okay, the end is really bad. I was really forcing the last twenty pages. Even though this may seem like a bad reveiw, and it sort of is, I think the author is talented and writes pretty well. The descriptions of the exotic locals are really good. The main problem I see here is in the editing. That's why I give it three stars. I can't say I recommend this book, but I blame the lack of good editing, not the author."
4,A travel book masquerading as a novel.....,"....not that I found that to be a bad thing. The plot is fine and the characters are interesting enough, but this book is really an excuse for the author to convey her love and affection for some of the more obscure corners of Europe. And to her credit she does this very well. I very much enjoyed the book, but potential readers should know that this is not a thriller in the modern sense of the word, but more of a drawn out tale that sprawls.What the author does very well is interweave multiple story lines in a way that does keep readers anxious to find out what comes next. So while it is not a conventional thriller in many respects, it is captivating.Finally, it is fair to say that this is a romance novel masquerading as a vampire book. That isn't a criticism, just an observation. For many, this might make the book more interesting and to them I would say... read on!"
2,Where's the Suspense?,"Bland, slow, incredibly long story about a global search for Dracula, who is seemingly undead and well in the 20th century. One would think that the topic alone would be sufficient to create suspense, but it didn't happen."
1,I just could not wrap my head around this one...,Ok so the book is 642 pages (hardback). I expected this book to be thrilling with Vlad facts but After 100-150 pages I had to set it aside... I was bored.
2,Like Dracula this book just goes on without end,"This book starts out well and has its moments when something interesting actually happens, but the story quickly gets bogged down. Most of the time you have little idea who is talking, what they are talking about, where they are or who the various characters are. Despite the viscosity of the text I decided to just push through to the end. Two months later Dracula is dead. Or is he? Who cares? I was just happy the story was over! On the plus side you will learn some interesting history of the centuries long battle between the Ottoman Empire and Eastern Kingdoms. My recommendation - save your reading time and the whopping $4 this book will cost you."
2,"Great Book, The ending BLOWS!","700 pages of fabulous mystery, history and a love story all combined. The last 4 pages and the ending are a complete let down, I actually thought I was missing some pages. I am soooo disappointed with the ending, that I gave all my attention to reading this book and to be let down by some non-sensical ending really frosted my cookies. Ms. Kostova, you need an epilogue to your epiloge!"
3,An interesting suspense novel,"I am a fan of History novels, I enjoyed reading this book, in fact one of the few I found talking about Dracula without the bloody scenes. The research work by the Author is surprising, it denotes a thorough investigation on places and cold war history.I was fatigued by Elena's extensive research that make the reading tedious sometimes. I did not like Elena's mother disappearance's explanation, which was disappointing and weak. I would expect the author put an extra effort to keep the reader's attention.In summary, this is a good read, not my favorite, but worth the money."
1,BORING!,"I am giving up. The only fascinating thing about this book was the story of its publication. ""The Historian"" was supposed to be the next ""The Da Vinci Code,"" hence the purchasing price of 2 million dollars. ""The Da Vinci Code"" it was not. The book was very slow and overly descriptive. The only reason I was able to read as much of it as I have (130 pages) was because I was listening to it on audio, thus I guess I checked out during endless descriptions and historical background, and was engaged only during conversations. When I actually started reading the book myself, I couldn't get through even 10 pages. Can't recommend it to anyone I know, but it is a bestseller, so I guess some people find something in it to be enjoyed..."
2,Dismal without any kind of reward,"I don't mind longish books in the least and I LOVE the vampire genre. I thought this would be fascinating, and somewhat different. Well, it was neither, really. The book is bogged down with so much information, but it doesn't really do anything. It is very boring and tedious and I wanted to actually stop reading forever. But I read somwhere that it rewards the reader at the end. Right. Ok. I must have missed my reward then because I couldn't guess the climax if my life depended on it. Well, I'm joking of course but, literally it was the most boring pointless ending to an already pointless book. I saw no redeaming qualities about this book whatsoever. I admit some points were interesting, but that is because I like the genre. But as a book, it failed to capture my interest or attention. I am actually surprised I finished it. It has never taken me so long to finish a book before, ever. And what a waste it was."
3,Fails to keep the pace,"If I had only read the first, say, half of this novel, it would have been easily five stars. Kostova is clearly a talented writer who intertwines her three quest-for-Dracula narratives well, keeps a taut feeling of suspense and horror, and interests you in the lives of her characters.And then... it starts to slide. Yes, from a literary standpoint, twists should not come from nowhere. If a gun is fired in act three, it should be hanging on the wall in act one. However, if you cannot guess Helen's ancestry a few hundred pages before the BIG TERRIFYING REVEAL, you really are not paying attention. The love story loses steam, we spend endless time hopping around various places in the USSR, the remaining twists become dull and predictable, and the final confrontation with the master vampire? Lame and twee. The epilogue tries to redeem this by returning to a more grim tone, but doesn't quite make it.It's worth reading, don't get me wrong. But try it at the library first."
1,"I wanted to like this book, It just didn't happen","The book started off well enough. I told my wife it had ""promise"". But it became a chore to read. She flashed between herself and her father and between an old father and a young father and a young girl and woman that I spend most of my time trying to decide from what point of view the story was being told. Could have been a good one but ultimately it fell on its face."
4,The Historian,This is a very good book an excelent choice for a summer read. It takes you all over the world and the writer does good job of explaning what the charcters are seeing as far as sites go. The book is a little dry in spots and does tend to jump around a lot from charcter to charcter and past to present so you need to really pay attention when you read this book. It is not just a mindless piece of work that you can daydream through chapters and still know what is going on. Overall the book is really good and should be read.
3,"Dull, plodding, no real thrill.","I don't understand how this book has made it to the top. It is long, overblown and boring. And I read the whole thing. It had a sweet premise, but it never is fulfilled. There is little to no creepiness and no chills. Anyone looking for a horror/vampire story should look elsewhere."
5,Highly entertaining first book,"I was very surprised that this was a first novel. It was highly entertaining and an enjoyable read. I did not want to put this book down (a good thing when you consider the size of it). It is a great combination of historical fiction, mystery, romance and the supernatural."
2,The Historian,The story line is interesting but I found the book to be a bit slow paced. There is also too much and too repeatative history of the Ottoman Empire and Transylvania. I had to put it down every few days to read something more exciting then return to a few more chapters.
4,fascinating story,"I've never been one to put much faith in the existence of Dracula, and I still don't, but this story is just amazing. What I loved most about it was the many locales to which the characters traveled. Any writer who can transport me to various parts of the world, and make me feel as if I am really there, gets two thumbs up. I only hope this is just the beginning for Ms. Kostova. I would probably read anything she writes in the future."
2,Could not wait to put it down!,"I could not wait to get this book-what a disappointment-forced myself to get a little more than halfway through hoping to find out what happens-finally decided I really didn't care! The reviews from amazon gave me a much more interesting explanation of the ending & I decided I didn't have to muddle through the rest. Anyone want to buy a ""gently used"" copy?"
2,boring and spineless,"The premise is promising, and I had great hopes as I started this book, but found it hard to stay engaged after page 200. Every character in the book has the same voice and cadence, and it gets dull very quickly. The father, the daughter, friends they find along the way, everyone speaks in a spineless, verbose style, making the entire book 'soft'. Frankly, I've given up."
4,Strangely convincing,Can a book be 'unlikely' and 'convincing' at the same time? A strange story but with a mass of historical background facts to beguile us. It does set you thinking..! A great read.
4,GREAT BOOK BUT THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL VAMPIRE FANS. IT WAS ALITTLE SCARY AND CREEPY. I ALWAYS HATTED VAMPIRE BOOKS AND MOVIES (EXPEPT THE BLADE MOVIES BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTION NOT SCARY). BUT I WOULD PUT THIS AS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS. I AM A HISTORY FAN AND YOU WILL LEARN ALOT OF HISTORY ABOUT DIFFERENT PARTS OF EUROPE IN THIS BOOK.I DO NOT SEE HOW ANYBODY COULD NOT ANJOY A WONDERFUL PIECE OF LITERITURE LIKE THIS ONE.
2,Men are described as women,"I know it's hard to write how men are different from women. Maybe the writer tried to show us how all of us are equal. BUT - based on stereotypes - I could say the men on this book (Paul manly) have the behaviour of women (shyness, love for details and convoluted dialogs instead of action and pragmatism). It is like the writer was trying to project herself on the characters and have portrayed womanish traits on men. Maybe she is right and in the real world there are no differences between men and women, but absolutely the characters sound wrong in the literary world."
1,Boring,One of the very few books I never finished. I read over 450 pages and this book was going no where. Very repetitive decribing places and characters.
1,Hated it...,"Which I did not want to, because I love books on vampires. But this was a bad book. It is way too long, too boring and too hard to follow."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,This book is incredibly long and incredibly boring. Could have been 300 pages shorter. I am the type of person who can finish a 350 page book in one day while attending school full-time and working part-time...so why have I been trying to read this book for almost a month now? Thank God I only paid $.99 for it.
4,Potential to be excellent,"I loved the actual story of this book, but like many of the other readers said, there was just too much clutter and details that took away from the story. I enjoy a book that has good descriptions that really bring you into the story, but this was way too much. I found myself really skipping through long portions to get the point. If you like a good vampire story, it is worth reading, but be prepared for some sections that make it hard to continue."
3,cliche'ed ending disappoints,"I found most of The Historian fascinating, though at times obtuse. The disappointment came with the ending which was abrupt and left many questions and characters unfinished and unanswered. It was as if Elizabeth Kostova simply got tired and decided to wrap things up. If she had stopped at 634 pages I might have forgiven her. However, for an author to put so much time and research into what could have been a truly original work only to cheat the reader with a trite conclusion (or lack thereof) is the real historial fiction."
3,Interesting Premise...,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. I thought the manner in which it was written (switching between times and narrators) was intruiging, and that the plot was interesting. However, I found the end to be slightly unsatisfactory--it felt like it wrapped up too quickly, and I felt I still had questions at the end. The book is long, and it seemed like the author got to the point where she decided, this is long enough, let me wrap it up as quickly as possible. Still, it's an interesting first try. Also, I found a few odd constructions in the book, in terms of the English. Now, sometimes these were mistakes made by non-native English speakers, so they made sense. At other times, an American character would turn a strange phrase, like ""weighed a fortune."" Now, I've heard of ""weighed a ton"" and ""cost a fortune,"" but this phrase gave me pause. Small things like that annoyed me at times. It was an interesting take on the traditional vampire story, however."
4,Not what I expected,"I really enjoyed this book. I ordered it because I saw an article on USA Today. The article didn't really say much about what the story was about and I was expecting something much different then what I read. I would get into the book so much that when I went to bed, I would dream about Dracula. I really got into the time period and geography of the book. Made me feel very lucky to be living in America."
3,not impressed,"The plot vectors into many directions, time-shifting back and forth unneccesssarily.It is intersteing read if you like balkan history"
5,"Epic, Stunning and Thrilling","I am so glad a capable histoic fiction writer has penned the classic and chilling story of Dracula with such historic accuracy. I was hooked within 2 sentences! I think Kostova not only retells the classic Dracula story, but adds wonderful characters. The tender moments between the characters truely emulate real life. I adore this book and everything about it. I think people tend to overthink the plotline--it is simply a damn good story. This book was so thrilling, that I actually gasped at several points in the book! I recommend this to anyone looking for a quick read over the summer."
3,Long in the Tooth. . .,This was very well written. I would not consider this to be in the Horror genre by any means. If your looking for something scary try Salem's Lot. This had some suspense but no real gore. Oh--Did I mention it was Long?
3,The Historian,Overly wordy...plot fairly interesting...wouldn't recommend this book even if it is suppossedly on nyt best sellers list
3,Editor please!!!,"The Historian would have been one of the best 400 page books I ever read, unfortunately the book dragged on way too long. A great premise and story but there was too much unecessary description. If this novel is ever made into a movie it would be the case where the movie was better than the book - a rare instance."
3,Long and end unconvincing,"The novel is overlong. Although vampirism is itself unbelievable, the setting of the novel in the twentieth century doesn't fit in. Most importantly, Helen's reason for abandonng her husband and child for sixteen long years is unconvicing. Kostova could have made the second bite of Helen by Dracula take place in the cloister at France and make Helen say that she felt Dracula would take every opportunity to bite her a third time and make her one of his undead minions. And that Helen had to keep away from husband and daughter to protect them and so that Dracula may not trace her through them."
3,Four-pronged time trip,"Kostova is an accomplished writer, taking us on a four-pronged time trip to visit with vampires. Even for those not fond of the undead, this is a good summer read. A bit too long, but her writing is worth plowing through."
2,Doesn't live up to it's repuation,"I saw a Dateline regarding this book and read the reviews here and bought this book. Was very disappointed. From a person who is seldom critical of books and rarely finds a bad one...this book ranks in w/ those few. It was slow to start...slow to end. After spending 350 pages worth of reading time, I vowed to finish this book...but have to say towards the end I was just skim reading to get the book over with and didn't really care about what happened to the characters, or Dracula, by the time the book dragged itself to the conclusion. This book is one I'm almost embarassed to display on my shelves. I've never written a customer review for anything..but wanted to caution those thinking of investing their precious time into this unfulfilling book..."
2,Are We There Yet?,"Here is an author with a talent for setting the scene but an inability to get to the point. After six hundred plus pages, the action that unfolds is truly an anti-climax. Dracula is disposed of far too easily and Helen's tale of why she abandonded her loving husband and child makes little sense. Abandoning your family to do research to find Dracula to avenge your father's death is not a good enough reason to ruin your husband's life! A good editor would have cut this book by a hundred pages or more and given the story more focus. A vampire book should be sexy, romantic, violent, and this is really none of those things. The best I can say is that it stimlulates an interest in Byzantine history."
2,And that's...the rest of the story,"If you think Paul Harvey commentaries are thrilling and suspenseful, then you'll love this book.If not, then the main plot twists are so obvious that by the time the protagonists figure them out you want to drive a stake through the book."
1,Who's on first?,"This was probably the worst-written book I have ever read. The publisher, editor and author should be ashamed of themselves. I hear the author won a prize for best novel in-progress. Surely not this one. I dare anyone to tell me who's talking, in what city and from what decade. And do the characters ever stop eating? This was a better cookbook than a novel. If all references to food were taken out the book would be half the size and, hopefully, half the price. If I thought for one moment that my bookseller would refund my purchase price I would do so."
2,what can I say? Eh.,"Interesting idea, lots of great sentences and turns of phrase, but the pace of the action was so...drawn...out, she just lost me. I thought the book could've benefitted from some aggressive cuts - get to the action faster please! Descriptions of the places the historian and her father traveled felt to me like they were there to demonstrate the author's facility with language, and not to drive the story. And that's just self-indulgent."
1,Boring time waster,"As a big fan of Bram Stoker's Dracula and vampire books in general, I was excited to pick this book up and get reading. I plodded dutifully through nearly half of the book before giving up in disgust. Simply put, this was a gigantic waste of time. The characters are boring and their voices blend together in a way that makes it nearly impossible to distinguish one from the other. Don't waste your time, find something better."
1,Awful,I downloaded this by accident one day so I decided to read it. It starts off great but goes on forever and leads nowhere!! I forced myself to finish it and at the end wish I hadn't bothered!! I love to read and can't remember hating an ending or being so disappointed as I was in this. It had potential but it lost it half way through. I don't recommend it at all
2,tedious,"Felt more like assigned reading for a class instead of enjoyable fiction. author is obviously highly educated which is good , history references are interesting and well researched. But progress is so slow and the history and minor incidents of sinister happening don't entertain the way simple violence foes. Recommend the novel Dracula's for good vampire reading."
2,Disappointed,A very slow read with overwhelming detail. I bought it because of the interesting subject matter but was very disappointed
1,Very Disappointing,"Stopped right in the middle of page 68 and decided not to torture myself anymore. I hate to start a book and not finish it, especially after shelling out $25.95 for a 2-week old NY Times #1 bestseller, but I was completely disengaged from this book. I tried, but I just could not get interested in the author's story. The premise sure sounded great and it looks as though it'll make someone a nice chunk of change, but it's not for me. If anyone wants a copy, let me know and I'll send it to you postage due."
1,"Overlong, Overhyped, Underedited","It's the time of year for ""Beach Books"",but this is vacation reading only if you want to sleep in yourlounge chair. Unrealistic, stilted dialog and overwrought prosetell a story in 700 or so pages, which is about 400 too many.And don't even get me started on the ridiculous coincidences andawkward plot devices that drive this story. Pass on this,and read, or even re-read, Stoker and King."
2,All you need to know,"Dracula is alive...and collecting books! He's also trying to collect librarians, though less successfuly- probably because the job interview involves ridiculously boring travelogues and biting.This book attemmpts to make librarians sexy and exciting.Librarians...sexy...exciting.Do you see the problem here?"
2,"Heavy, heavy reading","I think the magic behind reading is letting your imagination create pictures in your head as you take in the plot of the story. Kostova's writing bogs the reader down with every detail, so much so, that you get stuck in the minutiae of setting.I got half-way behind this tomb and had to stop for I think there are other books I would rather spend my time on."
3,"Good writing, but the storyline...?...","The book is well-written, and it's obvious the author can write very well. That said, I think she needs a little help with her storytelling.A good book, but could have been much better if the below items hadn't existed.Spoiler(s) follow:It took 3/4+ of the book for any real action to take place. The background story is certainly enjoyable, but a bit much without anything truly taking place.We're to believe that Helen would simply leave her husband and daughter for all those years for really no good reason at all???(that's probably the most ridiculous thing to me)And to top if off, Dracula is slain in a rather anti-climatic fashion."
4,"Enjoyable, Ending Fishy","I won't spoil the ending. Enjoyed the book. It takes you to locales you would never imagine and explores some of the basic myths surrounding Dracula.Definitely draws you in with the mystery and suspense of vampires lurking about, and trying to figure out what is going on lends a smart edge to the story. Characters are dynamic and have depth."
1,Highly recommended for insomniacs!,"What a tedious, long and boring read. Maybe you'd enjoy it more, but after hanging in there as long as I could, it just didn't get any better. I kept falling asleep waiting for the excitement to begin."
1,"Long, tedious and full of loose ends....","As an avid reader of nonfiction, all genres of fiction, and especially historical novels, I was surprised that The Historian turned out to be such a tedious and dull read. I barely managed to finish it but kept on to the end hoping for answers to the many holes and loose strings in the plot, which still remained unanswered on the last page. I don't understand why this book is so popular or so well received by the critics. I recommend avoiding it at all costs."
1,Unbelievably dismal.,"I've only ever thrown away two books in my life before. This will be the third one! I just wasted four evenings of my life reading this awful thing. It's dull, long-winded but saying not much of anything, with dismal characters that you just want to slap. This whole 800-odd page book (I have the paperback) leads you to the last 20 or so pages where the researchers finally find Dracula. Dracula isn't frightening, he's old, uninteresting and smelly. If this is what an MFA teaches you to write I'm glad I don't have one. And what was a literary board thinking when this author was given an award for a novel-in-progress?Worst dreck I've ever read. Seriously. And to the author, GET AN EDITOR, pleeeeaaase."
1,Dan Brown meets Dracula,"This book is simply Dan Brown meets Dracula, without the tight writing of Dan Brown. Historian was in need of a good editor to discipline a first novel! I finished it simply because I can't simply abandon a book (a defect in MY personality). I found myself on many occasions screaming out loud, FOR GOD'S SAKE GET TO THE BLOODY POINT!!!"""
3,Gets off to a rousing start but fades fast,"I couldn't put this book down for the first 150 pages, but then as the story wore on I found myself having a hard time wanting to read on. I even picked up two other books and read them before I finally found the energy to finish. Once I did, I felt like I had spent far to much time for such a weak disappointing ending."
4,Compelling if you're patient,"I was really excited about this book after hearing about it on NPR. I wasn't excited, however, about the 647 pages. After the first fifty or so I was ready to give in, but I kept going. The patience was worth it. I thought the book delivered in wonderfully historic and literary ways. If you're not into a thorough historical reading and learning about how primary documents thread to create what we call history, this book is not for you. If you simply want a thrill-ride, this book is not for you. If you're a patient reader, who likes lots of detail and loose-ends answered, then this book is for you."
5,Loved it.,This is a favorite. I read it when I was younger and decided I needed a copy or two. It is worth the read.
3,A leisurely stroll through vampire-plagued Europe,For those who enjoy travel logs and vampires. The style is laborious and a bit disjointed because of the ever changing narrators. But it is a clever weaving of history and mystery.
3,WARNING: Spoilers Ahead -- really lame spoilers,"I wanted to love this book. I was so excited to get it after reading the advance buzz that I bought it on the first day. Let me say this first: Elizabeth Kostova is a fine writer, but her book meanders too much. I was willing to be patient through the travelogues because it seemed intriguing enough, but after all the suspense -- the secret Ottoman society, the kidnappings and mysterious ancient books -- it fizzles. Most of the book focuses on the mysterious disappearance of Professor Rossi, who has presumably been abducted by Dracula for some nefarious purpose and may already have been turned into a vampire himself. But at the book's climax, what is Dracula's evil scheme? The horrible fate awaiting the professor? To catalogue Drac's library. Yes, you read that correctly: ""Greetings. I vant to suck your blood. But first, do you know the Dewey Decimel System?"" This Drac is about as scary as Morgan Freeman's incarnation on ""The Electric Company."" Yeesh."
3,Where have I read this before?,Same old story.Not a new twist to it.Highly predictable.Kept hoping for a surprise. Altogether overrated. Very disappointed.
3,"Nothing to write home about - but not bad, either.","Did you enjoy the Dan Brown, Da Vinci Code stuff? Then this book would be right up your alley. A historical hunt through Europe and its fringes, there's a lot of dust and decoding of symbols. On the other hand, it is really just yet one more ""monster-hunt through history."" Enjoy - or read Samarkand, by Maalouf which has some similarities in plot, but differs in that it is actually an outstanding book.Samarkand (Interlink World Fiction)"
3,Check this out from the library - don't buy it,"I checked this out from the library instead of buying it..which I recommend to you as well. I was really disappointed in the book after all of the hype it received. While the history contained in it was interesting it overwhelmed the actual story a lot of times making the relevance of some of it questionable.The concept of the story was great, but it got mired down in a lot of history that wasn't clearly related to the plotline. There is so much missing information as to the characters and their connections and why they did certain things they did that I was very disappointed. This book also left a lot of unanswered questions. The ending was very disappointing after reading the 550+ pages that led up to it."
2,It's just not very clever....,"Let me start by saying the premise for the book is great, and it's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one. The problems it has are just too large to give it anything higher.First of all, it's not very clever. I was able to guess exactly what was going to happen hundreds of pages in advance. I just didn't see the twists and turns that other reviewers did.Second, the structure of the book was terrible. I didn't mind the idea that it was all told as a flashback, but there were several parts where the story was told as a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. It's almost like the author used this structure to cover up how simple the plot really was.Finally, much too much Deus Ex Machina. At one point the author uses the 'missing letters' excuse to avoid explaining how the parents got from America to Turkey. This kind of thing happens at waaaay too many crucial points of the story. I guess if you're not clever enough to explain it, Deus Ex Machina it!"
3,This book gave me bad dreams.,"While the book was quite well written, I found it disturbing, and that it haunted my dreams. I never completed it."
2,The Historian,"It's written in the epistolary style of Bram Stoker's Dracula. 670+ pages. Women love it but it's unbelievably slow and by page 350 I no longer cared how the writer finished the book. Needs about 300 pages edited out of it. If you've been in an accident and are bed-ridden, this is the book that will help you sleep while you recover."
2,Completely Lacked Compelling Characters Or Decisive Action,"The moment someone pulls a mysterious ancient book off the shelf you have got my attention but the story had better go somewhere meaningful. A novel in the vampire genre, no matter how well researched, cannot stand solely on the pretext of historical suppositions. As I sit here, without looking up at the synopsis, I cannot remember the name of the main character. Anything so easily forgotten is best forgotten. The structure of the story was built around dark, raining backgrounds and countless library backrooms followed up by the occasional tomb but it almost completely lacked compelling characters or decisive action. Kostova tried to set her work apart from previously written works, perhaps leaning more towards the Bram Stoker version than Interview With A Vampire. While I admire her spirit of depth, the story was sleepily written. Had I not been waiting for a revelation that never arrived, I would not have finished it."
4,Bad bad Vlad.,"A retelling of the Vlad the Impaler tale written in a Braum Strocker/European Travel Log way. I enjoyed her writing style and it was fun since most of the places she talks about I have been, down to the café that I sat in at St. Marco Square in Venice, Italy as well as Paris, Amsterdam (blah, blah, blah I am so well traveled). The book was really good, but around 700 pages I think she must have ran out of paper or her lap top battery was low since the ending seemed rather hokey and too neatly wrapped. But I recommend it."
5,The Historian,"I bougth it for my son in law, and he said it.s a very good book. I didn't have time to read yet."
4,An enjoyable read,"Although the book is too long, and some of the plot twists are unnecesary, Ms. Kostova spins a fascinating yarn, and her use of language is first-rate: every so often I would put down the book and think, ""Now, that's a great description!"", or ""That's a neatly-turned phrase!"". All in all, a book to be savored slowly."
5,Best Novel written on the whole of the Dracula lore,"I read about 5-6 novels a week, but this novel took me a week to drool over and absorb. It kept my interest from the first sentence and is a book I will read again in another few years...It is everything a novel should be. You will find youself wanting to skip ahead, but you don't dare, you must read every word of this 642 page book."
4,The Historian,This is a greatly entertaining book full of mystery and intrigue. Perfect for cuddling up with on a cold day.
1,A Complete waste of time...,"As a lifelong horror fan, I can't believe I fell for the hype surrounding this book. It is absolutely the most derivative, boring, poorly-written excuse for a horror novel that I have ever read. Ms. Kostova has absolutely no knowledge of the genre or it's conventions, and no skill at all as a writer.A complete and total waste of time."
2,Is it just me......?,Never mind the fact that the book was boring (according to other reviewers)and poorly written. I couldn't get past the 60th page due to the fact that the print was so light and small. Someone skimped on the ink on this book. The pages I read were good though but after reading some of the other reviews I don't think I would continue even if I could see the words (and I'm not blind - just wear reading glasses!).I love to read too much and have too many other books on my list to waste my time!!!!
5,Good Price and fast delivery.,This book was priced very reasonable especially for a hardback. The delivery time was only two days. I had no problem waiting two days to save $8.00.
2,A Disappointment,"All I can say is that if and when this novel is made into a movie, expect a lot of changes. A screenwriter will certainly not go with such a slow, dragging pace. Also, there will need to be many more actual confrontations with Dracula, not just infinitesimal accretions of knowledge boringly gained through research about the vampire. There will need to be more horryfing scenes and far less looking through dry manuscripts. And that pretty much sums up my objections to the book."
3,Not bad,"This book was recommended to me because I enjoy vampire lore. I began the book with high hopes. That was probably my problem. I did enjoy the dialoge between the characters and the language of letter writing displayed in the book. I am impressed with the intellectual, antique style of writing.My main problem with the book is the constant inaction throughout the story. I found myself getting very tired of the main characters going into yet another library, to do more research. I suppose that was the point of the story, but I was still bored with it.The ending was good and the payoff was right on point. I would have liked to hear more about what happened to the main characters after the final battle. I hear this may be made into a movie. I think a talented scriptwriter could make this story into a great film."
1,Overrated,"I was so excited for this book to come out. I thought it was going to be an action packed novel about a girl desperatley trying to find out about Dracula. Goodness was I wrong!!! This book reads like a history textbook about ancient europe. It is dull and boring. There is no juice, nothing that wants to make you go further. For all of the hype it received, it should have been a lot better. If she would have cut out about 300 pages, it could have been more interesting. I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone."
1,Why was this book published?,"I'm a writer. Even better, I'm a reader. This novel shouldn't have been published. It should've been tossed when she sent it to her agent.Someone said an abridged version would've been better. I agree. The middle 598 pages should be tossed, and the first and last pages kept.If you like the boring and the banal, buy this book. I'll give you my copy. If you like good books, stay away."
3,The Structure of The Novel Failed me,"I really looked forward to reading this novel as I was familiar with the Valad stories and I have traveled in that part of Eastern Europe. However after 100+ pages I gave it up. A story told though letters is tough enough to pull off but combine that with the choice to set the type for the letter in Italics and I found my eyes just could not take it anymore. I gave it three stars because I believe it probably is a fine book if you can get past the structure and the typesetting but I just could not ""fall into"" the book and I really did look forward to the long read. Perhaps after just finishing Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell I was expecting more immersion into scene and setting without the &%$#@ letters. I wonder if she even used dreams as a story construct. Oh Well, it goes back on my shelf in an unread condition."
1,Had so much to offer,"This book severely lacked substance, was way too long, was too slow, and was too back & forth for my liking. It constantly switches from first person, to third person, and it's very hard to follow. I was really disappointed, as it does really sound interesting, but is just too dense."
3,Historian provides too much history,"I am a middle aged adult female and I enjoy tasteful books and movies on vampirism. Even loved the Buffy movie and series. That said, the storyline in this novel is very intriguing and all is well written, BUT... I just really got impatient when very often the author is so over the top with all the history fillers of the Carpathians, Romania, wars in that area and such. I wanted the meat of the book, not the bone, plasma and corpuscles that lie beneath.This made a good night table book, because one can only read a limited amount before being anesthetized with details which leads to a certain sleep. 1172 pages long, this book would have been much more enjoyable deleting many of the facts which only added to the length of the book, not the story."
3,"Great start, Drawn out middle, Limp end.","If you lost about 200 hundred pages of superfluous meet and greets, and revamped the ending you would have a pretty great book. As it stands, though, you have a potentially great book and a potentially great writer (who should have had a great editor to reign her in) and slowly as you read you realise that the potential is lost, your mind is wandering you are figuring out early on questions the characters are negligent in not asking; you hope then that there will be a really tricky end-- and there isn't it's exactly as you had figured out 250 pages earlier and now you feel like a tool."
2,I really tried to like it,"I usually read books in 2-5 days, it took me approximately 3 months to read this book. I liked the concept of the book and the historical information was very interesting. However, I did not like a single character in this book. The characters were way too sentimental and two-dimensional. Maybe its just me, but I would not risk my life and freedom to search for a missing doctorate advisor nor would any of my fellow graduate students. The author does not establish the relationship between student and the mentor rather we are told that he feels strongly about his mentor (told again and again) without telling us why. I know this seems like a weird thing to focus on but the whole plot is driven by the student's search for his mentor. I would have loved to read more about Constantinople and Eastern Europe during the Ottoman reign but instead I got pages and pages of corny characters reflecting about their feelings."
3,"Very interesting plot, but way too long.","Overall, this is an interesting story. It is well thought out and very well developed. It is just simply too long. I don't think I will ever read another 600 page book. It would have been spectacular if it was just 300-400 pages. If you are facsinated with dracula and vampire lore then I would suggest reading it, however you can skip paragraphs and sometimes pages. If you are not into long descriptions then you better plan to be reading this for a while."
3,"Interesting, but badly paced","It was with a great sigh of relief that I finished this book. I think what I said was, ""FINALLY.""To put it simply, this book was just too long. While I enjoyed the da Vinci Code-esque puzzles and exotic locale, after a bit it became very repetitious. She just did not need so many documents and puzzle pieces. And the ending? Way too short after such a long haul. It was just BOOM and then it was time for the resolution. All this novel needs is a bit of rewriting and reprioritizing.Kostova's characters are well-developed and interesting, and her writing style--while not memorable--is perfectly appropriate for this sort of novel. Thank goodness she didn't feel the need to be flowery, or else it would have gone on forever."
1,Don't Be Fooled by a Talented Marketer,"Simply awful. A waste of time and paper, readers would be better served to read about Dracula's real life than to waste their time reading this dull bohemoth. I recommend Dracula, Prince of Many Faces; and In Search of Dracula: The History of Dracula and Vampires. All of Kostova's information about Dracula is obviously gleaned from books such as these and make up the only good part of the book. My advice: Skip the poorly written fiction and read what the editor should have cut Kostova's book down into."
1,Unfair comments,"Those reviews that advance the idea that this book was not properly edited are utterly unfair. It seems the original book detailed how the main character met by chance every single one of the destinataries of the 1454 other books printed by Dracula. That brought him to 145 countries in the world (it seems the chapters where he travels to Burkina Fasso were particularly riveting). The book had to be trimmed down from its original 50,000 pages to the mere 650 it contains today."
3,"Great Beginning, Great Info, Dismal Ending","This book did 2 things well: 1)Capture my attention in the first chapters of what was looking to be a gripping novel 2)Perk my interest in learning about Vlad Tepes, the historical figureSeveral things that didn't go so well: 1)Long, ardous writing that caused me to loose interest and ""super-scan"" several sections, which I was able to do and not skip a beat -- meaning EDIT IT OUT. 2)Amnesia drink?? That was a crumby and disappointing way to write off that section of the plot 3)The ending -- From reading other reviews, everyone was equally disappointed and seemed to be thrown together with far less thought than the rest of the book. 4) Just as an aside, What happened to Barley? Everyone elses destiny was discussed, but he fell away from the ending.Off to learn more about Vlad Tepes..."
4,A thrilling yet time-consuming novel...,"Overall, I believe that Elizabeth Kostova's debut novel was a success. I not only picked it up because it was on the New York Time's book list, but because I held onto a thread of hope that it would be similar to that of Dan Brown's ""The Davinci Code"". And, although this particular novel hadn't ultimately blown me away in the way that Brown's novel had, I was not dissatisfied.This story sucks it's reader into a perplexing tale of vampire-lore, as it's charactars focus on finding and defeating Dracula in a ardous journey throughout Europe. And, although I expected the ending to finish with an amazing bang, the novel still allowed me to reflect in a positive light. In fact, I am just about to retire to my bedroom to read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", which had never crossed my mind until I read this novel.Overall, I loved the book, and it is definately one of my favorites."
3,"Great concept, but too wordy!","I'm an avid reader, and the size of the book did not deter me, but it was just way too wordy! Found myself skimming the pages, or just putting it down and starting another book. Maybe it's because it's her first book, and she thought it would be her last to make it entirely too long. I recommend reading this book if you LOVE history, but if you are looking for a can't put it down vamp book try one from the Anita Blake or Southern Vampire series."
3,I enjoyed it,I guess I can add my three cents (or three stars) to the mix. After reading the other reviews (obviously not all 1188) which ran from one star to five I come down squarely in the middle- nothing wishy-washy about me! I enjoyed it; I like reading about foreign locations; the stuff about Dracula was entertaining. I await more from Kostova.
3,she is still green in writing,her narrative is ok but the plot is protracted.I am bored halfway and reluctant to proceed.The writer needs to learn how to grasp the reader's heart longer
1,Good Idea But...,"This book moved way too slow. Multiple narration better have some very interesting people doing the narrating.This Empress isn't wearing any clothes (however...from what I seen from Elizabeth Kostova photo, that wouldn't be a bad thing at all);-)"
4,Read it for halloween,"This was a good summer read. I have to say the length of it intimidated me, but it wasn't bad. The different storylines get confusing, but you get use to it. The story is exciting and I learned a lot of it. If you enjoy traveling, vampires, and details stories this book is for you. The only downfall is some parts are dull and seem repeated, but it was well done overall."
2,I waited until half way through the book for it to start!,"I think the other two 'reviewers' are friends of the author. This was the most drawn out, needlessly wordy book I've read in years. Here's a tidbit, authors: Anne Rice's books are good because they don't use words as filler. J.K.Rowling's books are interesting to any age because they don't use big, fancy words to try to make the author seem far superior in intelligence to the reader. And a word to critics: Don't be intimidated by exuberantly profound wording that may cloisteringly envelop your psyche so much that you lose touch with the fact that it's still a crappy book!!! There was one interesting part within the first 10 chapters and by the time I got to the middle I was asleep!!! Anne Rice, and I've spoken with you personally in the past, you have NOTHING to worry about!!!!!!"
1,STAY AWAY!,"I have never bothered to post a review online, but after finishing The Historian and reading through several pages of reviews I felt compelled to. This is the worst book I have ever read. There are a couple that come close, but The Historian gets the nod due to its length. It is poorly written in the sense that the author lacks any ability to build suspense or tell a story (and it's a ""thriller"" about Dracula). Obviously a lot of people enjoyed it, and presumably not everyone who enjoyed it has universally bad taste in books, so I'm not sure what to tell you if you're considering reading it. If you're bored after the first 50 pages, RUN! You'll save hours of frustration in not only your life, but also for your spouse who has to listen to you complain every time you pick up the book."
1,"So, why did it take you so long?","I have become more and more distrustful of publishers' abilities to pick books we want to read, and this book is a prime example. Is it just me, or have even usually solid writers like Michael Crichton run out of words? This author had, I guess, the opposite problem, which was not knowing when to quit. I finally did after about 120 pages as the main character pulled out her yawn-invoking, story-telling father once again. To the complainers I have to say this: What took you so long in figuring out this book was a massive waste of your time?"
3,"I had a ""love/like/hate"" relationship with this book...","yes, it is intelligently written and wonderfully descriptive and I loved the historical backdrop of Eastern Europe; but, I have to tell you - there were moments when I was bored to tears. Overall I liked the book, but I was glad when I was done reading it. Also, I didn't miss the characters as I do with other books that I'm done with - I just didn't feel that intimate connection.Do I recommend it? Sure, but only if you don't have anything else to read at the moment."
2,Mildly Interesting but Very Tortourous,I'll start out with the good points. This book takes a very interesting tour of 15th centruy European history. Very informative.....but not page turning. I along with other readers really felt like this book could have used some serious editing. When one is on page 500 of a 650 book and nothing really has occurred other than the examination of an ad nauseum list of ancient manusroipts... it becomes difficult to continue. I really struggled through the last 150 pages and the so called climax of the novel. (Which was very anticlimatic if you ask me). Interesting concept. Poorly executed
2,Better Than Sominex,Chop 200 pp out of this tome and the result would be a shot at a good read. What we've got is an overblown treatis of a tired subject that proves that...when it comes to Dracula...there's nothing new under the sun...or would that be the moon?P.S.I'm using my copy as a doorstop.
4,All Rolled Into One,"If you're looking to read a book with ingredients such as suspense, thriller, mystery and horror, then you will love The Historian. It's difficult to believe that the author is debuting this title. She's one to look out for. See all of my highly recommended novels by clicking on ""see all my reviews."""
5,A delight to read,"I really enjoyed this book. I was very impressed with all of the accurate references to the historical details. Great author and I'm hoping she will come out with a new one soon. You definitely have to enjoy history as the title implies or else you may get bogged down by the references to it. IF anything, you'll walk away want to go to Budapest or one of the other fantastic destinations they mention."
2,Aargh,"I second everything in Craig Kenneth Bryant's review. Thank goodness... after reading so many stellar reviews for this tedious book, I thought that I must be the crazy one. Yes, the quality of writing is better than say, Da Vinci Code, but it is overly long, with waaaay too much detail and description given to people and situations and rooms that are completely inconsequential. Who cares that a black spider was on Helen's back? Why do I care about every minute detail of every hotel room, unless it's going to advance the plot, or make some sort of point? And the so-called ""coincidences"" of meeting just the right people at just the right time... oofah.I love travel and I'm all for exploring dank and dusty cathedrals and monasteries, but for the love of Sveti Georgi, enough!"
2,Not Worth Your Time.,"This book is truly a waste of time. I like me a page turning thriller with a hint of horror as much as the next guy, but the problem here was - this wasn't a page turner, and it wasn't scary.The Historian is just straight up bad. The plot plods along without purpose, and the characters are full of detail, but no heart. There are many ways to write a good novel. It can be focused on characters, on plot, or on ideas, but if you've got characters no one cares about, a plot that doesn't move, and no important ideas to speak of, well, your book is just not going to be any good.I am told years of research went into this, which probably explain the mind numbing cultural detail. Apparently, not only can you write about vampires and exotic locales in a totally tepid and uninteresting style, but you can also become a bestseller by doing it."
2,Bigger is NOT Better,I finished reading this book and it was a chore. However not as much a chore as finishing Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Both books were over-hyped and made it to the New York Times Best Sellers list. The only good thing was that I borrowed The Historian instead of paying for Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell!
4,just had to say,"I loved this book. If you are looking for an Anne Rice type book then this is NOT for you. This is a HISTORICAL FICTION. It has a lot of history which drew me into the book to begin with. And it entwines history, fantasy and reality so well that I almost wondered if it was a factual book instead of fiction.If you are NOT interested in history then yes it will have its slow moments. But the suspense and mystery of the book more then make up for it! There were times in the book when my heart would race or nearly stop out of suspense! I got so involved in the story that I would dream about it, and even think about it like it was really happening. If you like history, if you like the story of the real Dracula, if you like suspense and are not afraid of a more challenging read then this book is for you."
3,A lot of unwarranted hype,"Sigh, I'm aware that is was a debut novel, but i feel that much of the praise lavished upon this book was unwarranted. I bought this book the first day it came out, due to the amazing reviews this book was recieving, however after reading this book i'm not sure i read the same novel other reviewers did.That is not to say i did not enjoy this book, it was an entertaining read all the way through with amazing locals and facinating characters. The length of this book was entirely unneccsary, and many sections of the book dragged on with seemingly no end in sight. Its not an easy read, and i suggest setting aside some serious time to read this book. The Historian in not the sort of novel you can set down for a few days and expect to be able to pick back up right where you left off.I don't think this book will blow you away compared to other books in the same genre, but if you have the time you should be entertained."
2,Fails to live up to hype...ambitious but dull,Touted as a smarter Davinci Code type novel blending fact and fiction in the search for Dracula this ambitious debut fails at entertainment and suspense.Lots of sightseeing as the plot meanders through Bulgaria to Romania stopping for tea and various tasty homemade meals along the way.The details are impeccable but the whole book is details all dryly trotted out.The tales of the characters related through flashbacks via many letters grows tedious.The drama finally surfaces somewhere around page 570 but you have to go through too much tedium to get there.
2,"Slow, drudging, like a textbook","First of all, I read a lot of historical fiction. I like long, complex historicals. The idea of reading a long book does not put me off.But this one did.I picked up this book hoping for a good gothic vampire story, something mysterious. This just isn't it. It is not written badly, it is just written like a drudging textbook. The narration is offputting- you are constantly tossed out of the story to switch narrators, so I could never get into it. The author felt the need to put in details that no one needs to know to have a good story. It is like someone narrating to you every single step they take in the morning before going to work. Boring."
2,A disappointing experience,"Oh, this book showed so much promise in the beginning, but then it ended extremely one-dimensional. It's not much of a vampire story, more like a story of unravelling a mystery. It could have been much better if it had not been stuck with needing to invent a contrived connection to both the historical Dracula and the vampire in Stoker's novel."
3,So So,"This book is, like Dracula's life, interminable. Parts of it were enjoyable, but it was too long and the end was not very satisfying. It is crammed full of historical detail, which, while interesting, can be overwhelming. Summary: bloated and never-ending."
2,Too Contrived for its Own Good,"I started this book with high hopes and found myself very disappointed. The book could have easily been 200 pages shorter if the author and her editor had done some much needed cutting. Dracula doesn't show up until the very end and by that point I was so sick of all the characters, who are dropped in to move the plot along, that I really didn't care. I would have quit reading the book sooner, but it was a gift from my boss and I was afraid not to finish reading it. I don't know why this book got such great reviews."
2,Strong Start Weak Finish.,"The first hundred to 150 pages are good. After that the book becomes plodding, dry, and academic. When I finished I did feel I had wasted a lot of time.I would recommend the first hundred or so pages for students in rhetoric classes as a modern example of good style."
5,A fantastic novel,"Remember folks, this is only her first novel. It is a tremendous work of fiction with an intriguing hook, great suspense, and an excellent command of the language. Comparisons with Dan Brown are totally unfair because Elizabeth Kostova is much more talented. This is one of those books which sucks you in and keeps you interested. You become invested in the characters. At heart, it's a story about a little girl trying to get to know who her parents were. Kostova manages to incorporate the history of the Cold War and the myths of Dracula without becoming overbearing about either. I'm a complete book snob, and I loved this novel. Of course, by way of disclosure, I am a historian and thus have a little bias when all these heroes happen to be historians, too. Definitely worth reading; it's one of those books you look forward to picking up at night."
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I was very disappointed in this book. From the beginning the writer mentions that these were true incidents from personal experiences and written documents/letters, that some of it was made up of what she ""thought"" had occurred. When she wrote that her father and Helen saw the professor grow fangs before their eyes and blood drip from his neck as he laid undead for weeks in a coffin , I knew this was all rubbish. Furthermore, she claimed all this was left in letters written by her father. Unbelievable ! She should have listed this a PURE FICTION, that is what it is. What a waste of 30.00 !!!"
2,Sorry I read it.,"Put a few color pictures in it, and you'd have the Fodor's guide to the Balkans. Lots of tourist spots and local history lovingly rendered, with plot thrown in as an inconvenient necessity. Conflict and character development are sacrificed in favor of detailed descriptions of hotel stays and lists of ammenities.Early criticism pegged the book as an attempt to intellectualize a pulpy immortality rag. These things generally don't work out as planned, and this book is no exception.From what I've seen of the author, she seems to be a decent enough person. If she ever decides to write a real travel guide, I'd probably buy it. Here's hoping she abandons fiction entirely."
3,"Long, meandering historical vampire fiction","Plus Side: Nice job painting a lovely picture of eastern europe in both the 16th and 20th century (crumbling ruins, cold war eastern europe environment). Really, a few pages it does transport you to those places.Minus: Ultimately, this is a vampire novel, and a sketchy one at that. Avoiding spoilers, the vampires' behavior is a bit strange, even for a vampire, especially at the end. The author spends soooo many pages developing the lovely environment the plot gets shoved back in the corner somewhere. And there are soooo many pages. I spent many a minute wondering when the main characters were going to get wherever they are going.If you have a lot of time and really like vampire novels, consider this one, otherwise skip."
3,Silly but perfectly enjoyable,"Sorta like Da Vinci Code meets Dracula, although not quite as lame as that sounds. (It's much better written, not that that's saying much, but the history is just as muddled.) I wouldn't exactly call it required reading, but it kept me entertained enough on a plane ride."
3,Good enough,"This is nicely writen book but my problem lies in the fact that is excessively long. I seemed that everyone found a piece of information about Vlad all the time. This ,on many instances, did not necesarily made the plot better or more compelling. Honestly, it really confused me. Aditionally, the back and forth travels of most of the principals added to the convuluted story...history. I must admit that the wrting was very elegant and engaging and I learn quite a lot about medieval eastern Europe. Good work but too long."
2,OMG,I've had this book for 6 weeks now and can't get through it. I've started & stopped it twice and read 3 other books. Don't get me wrong it is written well and the idea is great but the characters need more flesh and it could lose 200-300 pages and be better.
2,I Just couldn't get through it....,I tried really hard to like this book. I attempted to read it multiple times and couldn't get into it. It was uninteresting and didn't have the historical or theatrical pull that any of the other books on my short-list had. All I can say is blah...
1,premise is interesting...,but story is very slow. the setting is good but the characters should have been developed further to allow the reader to connect to and better relate to them.
3,audio of The Historian,I listened to the audio while also reading in order to finish for a book club date. Skip the audio...the music & Eastern European accents are like a bad vampire film (not even as good as Hammer films) Better to let your imagination create the voices.
5,A Truly Excellent Read,"I must say this is a book well worth the money. It is quite a good read and keeps you ""into"" the story, or interwoven stories I should say. Kostova is an excellent writer and even though I did not finish the 642 pages of small print at once, I was able to keep up with the interwoven character's ""letters"", brought together by the main? character's narration and was impressed with her travels through time and countries to follow the trail of Dracula. Her knowedge of the history of Eastern Europe was very interesting. The ending was engaging as well, leaving much to thought and a hope for further writings on this subject."
4,Flawed but still better than most,"I'm a sucker for horror that's more suspense than horror, for the long slow buildup of tension. This novel does that beautifully. There were slow parts, some unnecessary parts, but it was much better written than so much of what's out there that it profited from the low standards set by the competition. Unfortunately the build up was rather better than the denouement, but I hope the writer sticks to this genre; it was awfully good, and too much horror is horrible rather than horrifying."
2,Disappointed,"Silly me, I read the reviews of the book so I am not sure exactly why I am disappointed in the book. It might be the tedious writing style, the general tone , or the subject itself but, despite being an avid reader of all kinds of topics, I am just not thrilled with this book. This book might be geared to tried and true Dracula addicts, or it might be the kind of book where you need to read hundreds of pages and then you are caught up in it. In either event, I am not a Dracula addict and this is a little too dry for my tastes; there is no way I am lasting hundreds of pages hoping for the aha! moment when this book makes me happy I am reading it. Sorry....don't like it."
3,IT'S THE EDITOR'S FAULT...This book should have been 150 pages shorter...,"The author had some genuinely gorgeous turns of phrase. Her research was extraordinary. But had the editor chopped 150 pages off of it, primarily from the middle, it would have cleared the way for me to care more deeply for the main characters. I found it a chore to finish, but I will give a fair chance to her next book. The girl's got chops, pardon the pun...."
4,"Old story, new take","Once in a while it can be fun to revisit old legends. Dracula stories can be hackneyed and hokey, and vampire novels abound, but Ms Kostova has managed to write something fresh with some touches of originality. Does Drac still live? Where is (are) his tomb(s)? Where's his head? Three generations of historians follow the same mysterious trail through western and eastern Communist Europe, telling of their adventures in their own words along the way. A mix of folklore, history, time travel, and love story (NOT a romance novel), The Historian is fun and intriguing. Who is the historian of the title? That's for the reader to decide."
4,A Good book that needed a good editor,"Kostovo's ""The Historian"" is an excellent read that could have been whittled down by about 100 pages and still kept its shape. Even so, this is a promising entree into the realm of modern sleuths searching for historical secrets that may not be as dead (or undead) as they seem. Read this instead of the multitude of Templar novels that weigh down the shelves at local book stores!"
1,Signs you're reading a bad book,"1. You tell everyone you know how annoying the book is.2. You're on page 300 and realize that a good editor would have cut out two-thirds of what you've read.3. The book is told entirely in first-person, in journals and letters, by seven different characters, and you can't keep them apart in your head.4. One of the ""letters"" comprises several hundred pages of the book, obliterating all suspension-of-disbelief.5. It's a vampire book that is 99% vampire-free, a thriller lacking excitement, and a mystery that is not compelling.6. You're on page 540 of its 642 pages and haven't touched it in three days.7. You finish it an immediately start composing a blog entry slamming it.8. You're reading the inexplicable bestseller The Historian, by Elizabeth Kostova."
2,Disappointing.,"Yes, this book was very disappointing. The first third was sort of interesting, suspenseful and mysterious. But soon thereafter the author began spreading the cottage cheese across the pages in heavier and heavier layers. It turns into a juvenile romance novel by the end. I wasted over $25 and five days on it. I did purge myself of this guilt by donating it to my local library, thus hopefully preventing others from making the same mistake. Given the popularity of this novel, however, the author will likely continue to write and publish many more books in the future. The thought makes me shudder and swoon. Do you want to read superb, even transcendental horror, the kind that is genuine literature? Pick up anything by Thomas Ligotti."
3,Ridiculous use of coincidences!,"My major problem with this book is every character the main character meets is on the same vampire hunt as he -- just by coincidence of course. A person sits at his restaurant table and low and behold he's been searching for vampires for years, same with when the main character goes to the library or a conference, etc. His search for dracula is riduculously ""easy"" and made for a frustrating read. It would have been more suspenseful to have the people he met throw him some curves or lead him astray. I had to skim thru the 1st 300 pages until the story began to grab my interest. I liked the detailed descriptions of the countries. I disliked the confusion of not knowing who was narrating the story - the father or the daughter!Anne Rice has said she will not write Vampire novels anymore; I am mourning this loss."
4,Eerie & Lovely,"The Historian ia a lovely debut novel, filled with both lovingly researched (which I found terribly interesting to follow along)information about an eerie, well-known subject...Dracula. While I take exception to a reviewer calling this novel suspenseful (it is much to slow to be considered such), though I did not find that this hindered my enjoyment of the complex plot, the beautiful characters, the wondrous descriptions of Eastern Europe and a brilliant concept. Kostova has truly made the legend of Dracula not only come alive but to actually cast doubt on whether this folk tale is a myth, a product of imagination...or could it really be...true?While most cerainly not the most fast paced of novels and this does hinder its tempo at times through out the book, it is so intensely and vividly composed it is quite easy enough to get through these flickering shadows for the recompense awaitng one at the end. This is more than worth the one tiny flaw of this inspired, original first novel."
3,"Off to a good start, but got a little lost","When I first started reading this book, I was riveted. I read the first 200-300 pages in about three days, but then something happens, or rather doesn't to this book. The book starts adding content to add content, and my eyes started closing over the middle sections of the book. I didn't understand this book was so fast paced and exciting, but then it started talking about monks and their movements for 300 pages and you wonder why that couldn't have been cut down significantly. Also, it went from a parallel story with the girl and the father to just being completely about the father. I feel like this book had so much potential, and that if you can get through the dry bits, it is really interesting, but if you are not very patient when reading, it may not be the book for you."
3,Confusing,In my opinion the historian is not the #1 bestseller it was meant to be. The book was interesting but didn't grab my attention enough. There was emotion but I couldn't feel it. At some parts I couldnt tell whether we were in the past or present. Whose point of view it was weather it was a boy or a girl. The only real action was near the last 200 pages of the book. They didn't even give the main character (girl) a name.I would only recommend this to people who have lots of patient. If your not one of these people don't read the book. I would not read the book again. And probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If your curios to see what its about/why its the # 1 bestseller then by all means read it. But if its for something else then don't unless you have to.
2,Pleasant enough for a while......but....,"A decent enough debut novel, interesting premise, well-written, and I loved the sort of travelogue feel to it all. But my word, this thing is just too long and slow. Pages 300-500 were a chore to get through and nothing really ever happens. Not coincidentally, that is the section of the book where there are little to no vampire appearances.I finished it. I didn't hate it. Parts were even quite excellent. But overall, just too much invested for too little reward."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but it wasn't what I got. After a promising 100 pages or so building up the plot and setting the foundations for what should have been an exciting adventure, the story flounders along at a laboriously slow pace. It fails to deliver either as a literary work or as a thriller. Characters remain two-dimensional and the attention to unnecessary detail is often painful. To carry off that kind of writing you need to be hugely talented, and sadly Kostova isn't - or at least that talent isn't realised here.A lot of people seem to love it, though, so it could just be one of those situations where I just didn't click with a book - it happens with some of my favourite writers."
2,Drag,"I received this book as a gift with great hope and enthusiasm. Vampire stories, though hokey at times, are usually fun and fascinating. I slipped into this novel only to be jostled free every 30 pages or so. A good story contains great background but a times it was a bit much. I kept thinking that the author had a few doctoral dissertations on obscure Hungarian and Eastern European topics lying around. Each time I arrived at one of these moments I rolled my eyes but continued to read. I was caught by the main story but drowned in the backstory. It could have benefited from a little more editing.Despite its flaws, I did finish this book, which is not always the case with me. It wasn't all bad."
2,A compilation of history... and that's it?,"It's an amazing book, in term of the historical depth that this book goes into (regardless whether it's accurate or not). The problem is, that's all the book have going for it. That's about what the whole book is about, one piece of history after another, compiled in a manner that tries to resemble a great overarching plot, but failed to strengthen the plot. The ending, in addition, is very disappointingly short, and seems rather inaccurate given what's written in the buildup for that climax."
2,Dry as dust.,"Readers are invited to join a young woman on a journey around the world to discover the truth about vampires, in particular, Vlad Dracula. Following a trail of clues in old journals, books, and letters, the narrator tracks down the undead. Somehow, this legend is the key to her own past, but how? Learning the truth could be the death of someone, or worse.** After all the hype surrounding this novel, I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it is as dry as dust. The characters are virtually devoid of personality, with truly interesting events only happening in the final few pages. **Amanda Killgore"
3,Needs to be shorter.,"Elizabeth Kostova is an excellent wordsmith. Her descriptions are vivid, her characters, three-dimensional, and she tells an interesting story.There are many captivating moments in this book. The problem is that between those moments, there are pages and pages of nothing happening, giving it an infuriatingly slow progression, if it's moving at all. Somewhere between pages 300 and 400, I got so sick of waiting for something to happen that I lost interest entirely. The only reason I kept reading was that the book was a gift.I'm glad I kept reading, because the book did have more to offer after that tedious stretch (even if the climax is somewhat disappointing), but the fact that Kostova took her sweet time getting to those moments made them less exciting.On a skeletal level, ""The Historian"" is a suspenseful adventure novel, but the excess fat makes it less engaging than it should be.This is by no means an ""adventure of monumental proportions."""
4,An enjoyable read,"History and fiction mingle for an interesting and entertaining read. If you are a Hollywood, big-budget movie type of reader (i.e. Dan Brown books), then you may want to skip this title for something a little faster paced. However, if you like to chew on material as you read, this book will probably be for you. If you are simply a Dracula / vampire fan (I'm in this category), then this is a definite must read. I'm not really much of a history buff, but this book also prompted me to purchase and begin reading some books on the history of the region. I'm currently reading ""A peace to End All Peace"" which chronicles the final death blow to the Ottoman Empire during WWI. I also purchased ""Byzantium: The Early Centuries,"" ""Byzantium (II): The Apogee"" and ""Byzantium: The Decline and Fall."" Reviews on Amazon seemed to indicate these as the best books on the history of the Byzantium Empire. Happy reading"
2,"An editor, please!","Somewhere in this novel's 676 pages is a marvelous 300 page thriller. Alas, Kostova's editors did not even attempt to find it. Through the premise of the novel is an intriguing one, the tale, like Stoker's Dracula, wanders quite a bit as the book proceeds. At times, I resorted to reading the first sentence of every paragraph until I found some actual movement in the plot. This strategy proved necessary over dozens of pages. The minute detail accompanying nonessential events becomes quite frustrating after the first hundred pages or so. Another problem with the book is the lack of distinctive characterization. Just about all of the characters have similar and prolix narrative voices. There is a real absence of gender difference in the characters' voices as well. In all, a disappointing book."
2,"Long on history, short on suspense...","After hearing about it all over in the press, I HAD to have this book. At first, I found it mildly entertaining. Halfway through I wondered when the story would start to get REALLY interesting. Towards the end, I was just gritting my way through it hoping for a return on all the time invested. If you're looking for a travel-log with more than a dash of histroy thrown in, this is the book for you. Frankly, I prefer more suspense in my suspense novels. Not one I'd recommend."
3,Fairly fascinating,"As I've read a number of vampire books, this one I had to read, too. A fascinating, academically-oriented twist on the Dracula story. As an aside note, however, I highly recommend anyone interested in vampires to read the progenitor ""Dracula,"" by Bram Stoker. It is one of the most marvelously written and scary books of all time. A must-read for Dracula fans. As for ""The Historian,"" I enjoyed Kostova's historical depth and the many historical and mythical facets she wove into this story. I didn't find the immigration patterns of the monks boring or pace-stopping as other reviewers have noted because these discoveries were a clue to the mystery. Kostova weaves some generally frightening descriptions of vampire activities and places, and her description of the cities, Budapest, Istanbul, makes me want to visit them. This is the kind of book you take your time with and get into--a ""curl-up-with-a-good-book"" book. It's not a fast read, although you won't want to put it down."
4,The Novel was well written...,"The novel was well written and that is what kept me interested until about the end. I liked the general concept of the novel and the interesting way it was organized, with the letters and all. However, what keeps me from giving this book 5 stars is the ending. It seemed quite rushed and hurried. The entire book was built on the suspense of finding Rossi and Dracula, and when they did it was found that Rossi was snatched in order to become Dracula's librarian and Dracula was not as formidable as everyone thought (considering how easily they killed him when they first met him). It took 600 pages to found out these mysteries, but the author tried to tie up the loose ends in 76 pages. It didn't seem like enough. Now, don't get me wrong, the rest of the book was great, I was surprised I liked it, but the ending is lacking."
4,Excellent book.,"Personally I know a lot of people who are fascinated by the whole Vampire myth. After reading this book you really will begin to wonder about it. There is a great deal of detail in the book that tends to be on the boring side, but once you get through that you can't put it down. I have let quite a few people borrow my copy of the book, and they loan it out and so forth and so on. My book has been passed around so much I don't even know where it is. I have to order another one for sure, to read it again. When I saw a review of the book and caught the opening of it I had to order it, the first pages of a book either grab you or they don't. Elizabeth Kostova did a great job researching and putting the book together."
2,A Must Read - For Insomniacs,"I suppose I should start with a positive...the movie will almost certainly be better!!!Actually, I'll keep this succinct. The way I describe this book to others is ""A 320 page novel *crammed* into a 700 page tome."""
1,Could have cut this book in half....,"I have read a lot of books in my day. And I have never read a book that I was 65 chapters in and still waiting for something EXCITING to happen. What a disappointment this book was. This author, tried way to hard to describe so much. I thought if I read one more chapter describing the mountains or the countryside I thought I would vomit. It was just too much. We get it! Europe is beautiful!!!!The plot seem to go around in circles at times, and the story line could have been cut in half. And I found myself skipping chapters and finding out in the long run, that I didn't miss anything by skipping them! Sad! Dracula has a library, that he wants someone to catalog-thats scary? And I read over 600 pages to find that out? Big deal. This was more like history lesson and geographical lesson not a vampire noval at all. This story line was ""never ending"" and it could have been cut in half and could have been so much better. I give it two thumbs down :("
2,So so,"I thought that this book was just okay. There were parts that were exciting and made me want to keep reading, but there were also parts that were not so exciting and made me want to skip ahead or just put the book aside. I am definately no pro on book writing, but I believe that there were certain parts that she just put too much detail into. She would go on and on describing something that was not an important part to the story. With that said, I am not suggesting that one should not read the book, but it would not be on the top of my suggestions list."
2,Could have been so much better and so much shorter!,"I found this book to be more a history lesson on Eastern Europe than anything else. I was so excited when I read the back cover and couldn't wait to get started. However, I found there wasn't enough ""thrills"" in between all the dates and history notes to really keep me interested. I was determined to finish the book and when I finally did get to the end I found it to be more of an anticlimax than anything else. A bit disappointing."
2,Boring,"I was so excited to read this book, but I just couldn't stay awake! With that said, the writing and history was amazing, it just lacked excitement. Every time I picked it up my eyes were closing within a couple pages. I finally just had to put it down for good after 106 pages and move on. I was trying to make it to atleast 200 pages to give it a fair chance, but just couldn't!"
2,Boring,I can usually read a book in a few days. It took me 3 months to get thru this one. I kept on reading it thinking that it just had to get better. With all the good reviews and recommendations I thought it would have been much better-but it wasn't!!
3,A little sloggish...,"overall, this was an incredibly well written book. It is obvious that Kostova did a ton of research. Unfortunately, this book dragged on forever and overflowed with what feels like useless information. At parts it took a lot to keep my attention and continue with the book."
5,Brilliant writing and story,"This is one of my favorite books and several friends agree. Brilliantly written with a clever style that is similar to the original ""Dracula,"" that is part of what makes this so wonderful.If you are looking for a wild Da Vinci thriller, you will be disappointed. This is so much more carefully plotted, definitely not pandering to be turned into a movie. It's subtle, not sensational.Things are deeper and more devious.I learned so much about Eastern European history, including the startling fact that Vlad the Impaler is not a bad guy in Romania. There are always two sides to every story.Yes, it was long, but who cares? I don't want to ""leave"" a good story."
2,"Way too long, way too dull","I don't think Kostova is a terrible writer like some of the reviewers on this page but she could certainly use a good editor to winnow this behemoth down to a reasonable length. The endless descriptions of the landscape had me skimming several pages at a time and she kept interupting the narrative flow with this tedious side story about the main character's daughter searching for her father. She kept telling us how the characters were filled with dread and horror but as a reader, I certainly never experienced either emotion. Stop telling us it's scary and start scaring us. She obviously wanted to write a horror story with literary pretensions but literary or not, horror is supposed to scare you. This book just bored me."
1,Don't waste your time,"Try as I might, I could not get into this novel. The characters lacked anything that might entice or endear me to them. They seem to be dim cutouts in a dusty setting. I always give books 100 pages before I give up on them, and it was a struggle to make it to the 100th page. It was not a struggle to put down. I love long novels and have devoured, with great enjoyment, such classics as War and Peace as well as more modern novels such as No Angel, so the length of a book has never deterred me. However, a long boring book that reads like someone's tedious dissertation does deter me. I hope this saves someone the trouble of buying this book or waiting to check it out at the library. There are millions of good books out there--don't waste your time on this one."
1,I Quit At Page 75,"I could not get into this book......I was bored silly. I even watched the author on Dateline hoping it would make me want to forge ahead....it didn't. Huge books don't scare me off, so that's not the problem. If a book is really good, I don't care how long it is. I just figured if I wasn't into it by page 75, I was never going to get into it. I am donating it to my public library. I hope someone else enjoys it....it just wasn't for me."
2,Wait for the movie!,"Don't waste your time on the book. Wait for the movie, then wait for the DVD and rent it with the ceapest coupon you can find.This is an amateurish first novel. The prose is artificial and stilted. The sentence structures are arcane. The book is too long by 50% due to rambling descriptions of places I doubt the author has ever been. The plot is not all that interesting and is predictable.How did this work get the hype it got? Who bribed whom? I suggest the author stop writing fiction with this tome or read many, many well written books by way of example, if she insists on trying again."
4,A Severe Test for your Suspension of Disbelief,"This book will severely test your capacity to suspend disbelief. If you can pass that test, and if you are not put off by the vampire motif (and I'm glad I didn't know of it when I bought the book), you will be rewarded with one of the best reads of the summer, if not the year. The research this author has done must have been encyclopaedic - and I did go to my encyclopaedia to refresh my memory of the various post-WWI treaties which formed much of the political geography of the book. I have visited many of the sites she describes, and the travelogue is impeccable. The characters are sharply and engagingly drawn, and you are despite yourself engaged with them - which undoubtedly helps with your digestion of a very tall story. Is the Vampire strain a metaphor for something? An intriguing thought for you to work through for yourself - buy it!"
2,Infuriating! (And not in a good way.),"Ugh. All I can say is ugh. I stuck through nearly 700 pages with such hope only to be dumped ceremoniously when our authoress realized that if she were truly going to do her story justice, she'd need to go on for another 700 pages! And it had such promise. Dad was suitably aloof, mysterious and yet loving. Daughter was slightly on the dull side but she had potential and was a good listener, which was really all that was required of her. Mom was loving and yet slightly sinister, weirdly believeable as a person. But it just tanked at the end.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of motivation of Vlad Tepes. HE'S DRACULA! He shouldn't need motivation! But that's what all the poking around in books made one expect. That and some nice parallel Cold War intrigue that also never manifested.If you're way into ""enjoying the journey"" and don't generally concern yourself with plot, go for it. If you expect an author who respects your time and intelligence, I'd take a pass."
2,Neverending Story,"I made it halfway, I admit it... I can't finish this book. I don't care what happens to the characters, so why waste the time? I know everything about where they go, everything about what they wear (surprisingly the thread count of their clothing is missing) but I have no clue who these people are. Why would I want to go on such an epic journey with them?I'm sure there is a good plot buried in there somewhere.1 star for an original idea1 star for the author's tenacity, it must have taken forever to write this book."
1,I bit and was bitten--pun intended,"Talk about a disappointment. After the glowing professional reviews, I bought this one. 647 pages later, much of which I speed-read, I realize I will not even give it to my best friend. What ever happened to editing? This thing could easily have been cut by 200 pages. It has been praised for its comments on the nature of evil. It certainly does--ad nauseam. No sublety at all! Pass this one up."
3,Long and often dry,"The author obviously knows her stuff. She knows history and geography, unquestionably. Her writing abilities are good, but the story just doesn't seem to hold interest. The idea is rather unique, but the book is filled with so much history and geography that it loses focus on the plot. I didn't hate the book, but I found my attention drifting quite often and forcing myself to regain focus as well as consciousness."
1,The Historian--too wordy,"I've been picking away at Kostova's epic for over a week, trying various forms of attack--hunting for the meat of the story, skimming the pages of overly detailed descriptions of architecture and attire. Time is too precious to waste on this tedious and boring novel. Why has it been so highly recommended and hype is beyond my comprehension."
4,great seller,"The book is really great! I just wish the print wasn't so small. I haven't been able to put it down. The product was as described, no fooling around with the description. It came in less time than expected! Thanks."
1,Not worth the effort,"Reads more like a college history paper then a novel...slow moving and dull as if Kostova felt the need to drag the story on for as long as possible...lacks character development, plot, and other basic fundamentals of an english novel...the end does NOT justify the read."
5,An Excellent Book,"This is a great book!! I would higly recommend it to anyone. It immedietly draws you into the story and unfolds the story of Dracula from several points of view at the same time until suddenly everything comes into focus. Simply excellent, very much in the style of the Da Vinci Code.Also the title should not chase away the history averse amoung us. This is a story told through the ages, though from the first person point of view."
5,Vlad the impaler - The dragon,"I have for some strange reason always been drawn to stories about Dracula. I have seen most of the movies available about vampires, and to this day, only a very few are worth seeing. When it comes to books, Dracula becomes more mythic and interesting.This book really gets to you, and give you a great story about history, facts ?, interesting characters and that little tickle that keeps you reading way beyond bed time (this is a GREAT book to read by yourself relaxing in front of the fireplace with the wind and rain hammering on your windows!)If you have the slightest interest of medieval history of Europe or Dracula, you must read this book!"
2,too many coincidences,predictable and disappointing but I read the whole thing anyway. has some interesting takes on the dracula theme.
2,Spectacularly bad writing,Great idea. Great incorporation of history and place; clearly the author did her research. Terrible writing. Much of the plot exection was plain stupid. This is not a literary novel or a remotely frightening novel. Seems like a great premise was dumbed down with aspirations of Da Vinci Code meets Harry Potter. What a waste of material.
2,Tedious and heavy,"This book was horrendously difficult to get through. Kostova is very good at constructing descriptive passages, but she fails miserably at plot, motivation, character development--everything that makes a book engaging. Her literary devices--Victorian letters from vague professors, a tale extracted from a recalcitrant father--ended up creating confusion. Who is talking here? And why? There was no reason for anyone to be doing anything in this book. Nor was there any emotional content in spite of numerous (and clumsy) attempts at creating tension through stock phrases which would have been hilarious in a potboiler. (A feeling of unnamed dread, an expression of horror, etc.). I would not recommend this book if you are looking for an entertaining read. However, it makes a great doorstop."
5,I cannot praise this book highly enough,"I got to the end of this book, flipped to page one, and started reading again. You feel like you are researching the history of the vampire right along with the characters. You read the documents they do. You hear the stories they do. These characters spend far more time in the library than they do fighting, and the story is richer, and more exciting, for sake of it. It is a return to great literature. I eagerly await the next book by Ms. Kostova. She's definitely on my list of favorite authors."
1,Don't bother,"This book is the perfect sedative. The weak plot is slow-paced and simply boring. The characters are shallow and unimaginitive. Just when you think something exciting is going to happen, it falls short. You need a degree in geography to know where the author is talking about - it's impossible to follow. I have no intention of finishing this one - right to the donation bag."
4,A beautiful and literate re-invention of the vampire novel,"This is really a four and a half star review, almost a five. The novel is, for the most part, superbly written, gorgeous in its descriptions, sure-footed with its characters. The author's ability to re-invent the vampire genre 110 years after Stoker launched it is amazing. (It may be said that Anne Rice re-invented the genre once already, but Kostova's effort is superior in every way.) There are some draggy and confusing parts as we get toward the end, and I think the novel really could have been shortened a bit, but overall, this is a masterful work of literature."
2,It's the ending,"I actually listened to the audio of this book, which is well done, by the way. I enjoy reading fiction about otherworldly creatures, and was deeply enveloped by this book until......the end. What a rotten ending for such a well put together story. I was so disappointed that I refuse to suggest this book to anyone. Which is unfortunate because I work PT in a bookstore!!"
3,grinds to a really lame halt,"This book starts off super promising and then draaaaaaags through some interminable lecture about monks, and then screeches to a really lame end. No, REALLY lame. Like, lame enough to make the whole book aggravating in hindsight, once you know what's been going on."
2,"I don't know how you can make Dracula boring, but...","I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was not daunted by the size of the volume, so I plunged in, with high hopes. And I waited, and waited. While the prose is beautiful and the descriptions are lovely, I did not purchase a Frommers guide, I wanted a novel. The plot twists were somewhat easy to guess and the characters' motivations were somewhat off (I can't see a parent leaving their child behind, no matter what). I got to the last page of the novel, hoping for a dramatic confrontation between the protagonists and the antagonist and I got nothing. I reread the last page in shock, wondering what really happened at the end, and realizing that this was it. Frustrating. Entertaining, but not much of a payoff at the end."
2,Dracula - the game...,"It's a comic/computer game book...the ""a-ha!"" moments are so pervasive that one becomes numb after a while, anticipating the vampire in the library...I didn't think it possible that a novel about this subject could possibly be dull, but this one is...It begins with promise, but is far too tedious and poorly edited to continue reading...darn, I, too, was lured by the hype - and full of hope. Silly me."
4,This book is not fast food,"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time, but beware it is not ""fast food"". It has lots of detail, development, and historical context - if you are looking for fast paced mindless action and don't want to savor the details - you will find this a difficult read. I compare reading this novel to eating a large, well planned, delicious meal. Take your time and enjoy every bite."
3,About 100 pages too long (WAY too much detail) and an unsatisfying ending,"I really didn't know anything about this book when I picked it up, but thought I'd break away from the old and familiar authors with whom I've settled into a comfortable rut. Unfortunately, this wasn't the right author with which to do that. It starts out promisingly, but around page 400 or so, you tire of endless library searchs and another arcane source of information about Dracula. And (SLIGHT SPOILER) without giving anything away on the ending, it ends like a typical Dracula novel or movie.Plus, the emotions of the main characters aren't realistic. The ending is tied up in a neat bow, not allowing for the natural anger that would occur in an elongated separation as described in the novel.It's not a bad read, but didn't seem worth the amount of time it took to read. I would have enjoyed it a lot more with 100 pages less, and it's not because I don't enjoy long books. This one just didn't warrant the additional pages."
2,"Good writing style, not so good everything else","Very little happens in the almost 700 pages of The Historian. The story is told through three generations of historians as they travel through Europe searching for the lost tomb of Vlad Tepes, better known as Dracula. The plot proceeds at a snail's pace and the characters are barely developed past the rather two-dimensional nature with which they are introduced. What kept me going for the first 200 pages was Elizabeth Kostova's wonderful writing style, and after that I continued reading because I thought surely with all the slow build-up and fact finding, the book had to be going somewhere extraordinary. I was wrong. By the time the protagonists reach the end of their search well after page 600, I was disappointed at how anti-climactic it all was. The Historian will serve as a personal reminder as to why I rarely devote my time to finishing novels that seem lackluster from the beginning."
1,Incredibly tedious and self-indulgent,"I rarely discard a book when I am finished reading it--but I want to save at least one other reader from wasting hours of precious reading time, and so I am recycling this one (or perhaps I will drive a wooden stake through it). I am a history buff, and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the literature program at UCSD--I am not a reader without patience. After the first 200 pages, it devolved into an endless travelogue--libraries and monasteries in country after country, blurring into each other to no purpose in either plot or character development. I kept going gamely for the next four hundred pages, and although I became increasingly bitter, I vowed to see it through. The last one hundred pages are interesting, but the suspense had been sucked dry long before."
2,Just skip it,I gave the book 2 stars for its wonderful description of the countries that the main characters travel to but that even got too long winded in places. The book just did not hold my attention.
3,B O R I N G,"It has a good premise and I can't lie and say that there weren't some good parts to it, but it just didn't deliver. I had to put the book away before I tore my hair out, because at times it was so dull.I got half-way through before I decided to give up. I'm not sure if authors are paid by the number of words or pages, but if so, this chick made a chunk of money. Alot of the writing is useless and over-descriptive.The beauty of reading is to escape into another world and let one's imagination run wild, but having it spelled out for you isn't what it may be cracked up to be.If possible, find another book similar to what this book promises, because it just doesn't give it."
4,Dracula Lives!,"I am always open for a new vampire novel, and this is one of the best new ones around. If you like books like The Da Vinci Code or anything by Preston and Child, then you will find this book, full of twists & turns, oblique characters, and plotting that needs Mapquest to figure out, a wonderful read. If you are looking for vampire sex/blood, this isn't it. Yhe interactions among characters is almost 19th century courtly. Relationships are slowly,gracefully developed as the sense of eternity emerges as one of the main themes in this novel. I have read just about every vampire novel imaginable, and I think this is one of the best in an often-overlooked genre."
2,I REALLY wanted to like this book,"I love this kind of book and was pumped about reading it. I kept waiting for the part that would suck me into the story, but it never came. The writing was good, I just couldn't get interested though. I finished it because I'm stubborn that way."
5,A writer with class,"It is rare to find a classic writer like Kostova in this century. She ranks up there with Jane Austin, Margaret Mitchell and Mary Shelly.With impecable credentials,Elizabeth Kostova has created a masterpiece investigating the legend of Dracula drawing one into the macabre tale within the modern age. One flies through the over 600 pages effortlessly engrossed in this modern gothic classic."
1,Spoiler Alert!,"Since 1976, Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire has been at the top of my list of the most boring vampire novels ever written. Rice must now move to second place, the top spot being taken by Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian.Here's the story. Dracula is an angry book collector who tempts academic historians into chasing him all over Europe so that he can turn them into vampires and make them catalog his impressive library. He does this with three generations of related historians. It's not clear why he would have to turn them into vampires, except that then they would be able to work for him longer. Nor is it clear why being a vampire is such a bad thing that these historians don't want to become undead.There are places where the reader gets a glimpse of something better, but it quickly gets buried under Kostova's turgid prose. Why she would have won any awards for this dreck, or why anyone would encourage someone else to read it is beyond my comprehension"
3,Very Da Vinchi Code-like,"As someone who is not much of a horror/vampire fan I did enjoy this book more than I thought. Someone else remarked that it is ""The Dracula Code"" and I would agree with that....If you liked the Da Vinchi Code you will most likely enjoy this.The tale was somewhat overly fantastic and hard to swallow in some parts, but the history and the settings were excellent. I noticed some reviewers complained about boring parts but I enjoyed the ""slower"" areas of the book very much. The author manages to impart a real feeling for the places in the book and manages to weave fact and fiction together nicely."
5,Great gothic tale!,"Great book, intricately told tale, with compelling characters (unlike The Shadow of the Wind, which I read recently). The vampire tale is well told, and revealed over time as the daughter discovers her parent's sorrowful tale."
2,A good book encrypted here,"There is a good novel encrypted in this massive, messy book, had the author pared it down by ridding it of the unnecessary book-within-a-book-within-letters-within-more-letters structure and by purging the melodramatic cliches. A few examples of the later, cited by Paul, one of the several first-person narrators: ""...made my blood run cold,"" ""I felt the blood drain out of my head,"" ""I felt the blood draining from my heart,"" my body ached profoundly,"" ""It had cost me a terrible pang,"" and ""A chill ran down my..."" There are too many chills running, crawling, and snaking across Paul's various body parts to mention. There is a good plot and interesting historical research here, but for me these were ruined by the author's excesses. I found myself speed-reading through most of The Historian."
2,Not so great,"Although very readable, THE HISTORIAN suffers a ridiculously slow pace (yes, stuff is happening, but it's the same stuff--over and over again), a plot that's chock full of coincidence, and characters that ultimately aren't that interesting. I love a good historical epic--even one with a slow build--but I had to give up on this one about 350 pages in. If a book hasn't hooked me by then, it's not going to. And the fact that characters ""just happened"" to keep meeting people who were also studying Dracula eventually just got too overwhelmingly implausible to ignore. If you want a weighty historical tome with some supernatural elements, I highly recommend Robert McCammon's The Queen of Bedlam or Katherine Neville's The Eight instead."
5,The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well written. It combines enough history with fiction to make the book very interesting. I highly recommend it.
4,Cozy Up With Dracula,"Historical Fiction has become one of my new favorite genres. I may never learn to like Non-Fiction, but this piece of Historical Fiction is the next best thing with snippets of Romania, Bulgaria, Istanbul, and Vlad the Impaler.The story's progression over 3 different eras makes for an enjoyable read, but, at times, it can be a bit difficult to remember which decade the story is in."
3,tedious,"Reading this book proved to be a tedious task. I agree with others who say that it was too detailed. After the first 100 pages or so I actually skimmed through it and just read when important pieces of the story were communicated--which was maybe one paragraph on every two pages. Even then, it was fairly predictable.I wanted to give it less than 3 stars because my expectations were high ,but it is actually not a terrible book, just mediocre. Wait until you can get it used and cheap. And don't expect a riveting read."
4,"Good book, but it could have been shorter","Love the book. First book I have ever read that made me feel suspenseful when you know who was lurking about. In retrospect her editor should have cut like 200 pages, but I am glad that I read it"
4,Excellent read for Dracula fans,"focusing on the historical Dracula character, this complex, well-written novel plays out it's tale from multiple points of view and covers several lifetimes. characters are well-constructed, the plot weaves and twists nicely, and the universe is NOT tied up neatly in a bow at the end. well worth paying hardcover prices for!"
1,"EDITOR, EDITOR, EDITOR","The paperback version...a 300 page book jam-packed into 900 pages. I long for the days when an editor was actually hired by a publishing company to do what they do best. Ms. Kostova suffers from a common ailment of modern authors...the inability to limit her subject. This book is alllll over the place. A GREAT start, interesting and promising. I might even go so far as to call it a fresh take on a classic, but eight hundred pages later we still have seen nothing but a shadow of Drac and have learned about the dining habits of every character in every country they visit. Written diarrhea. Very rarely do I consider not finishing a book, but this was a challenge to complete. A big, big thumbs down."
3,Along story with little pay off at the end.,"This is a first novel written by a new writer. As is often the case with new writers, the pacing is sometimes slow and bogged down with meaningless details. The author describes everything in way too much detail - including meal after meal after meal. I kept on reading because I figured that it would get more exciting, or at least have a great ending. This book simply wasn't very exciting. It would have been much better if edited by someone else. With over 640 pages, they could have cut the book in half to make it much more gripping.Note: If you love horror stories, try the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz, it is an orginal take on an old monster."
2,Tedious- A Great 350-Page-Book Inflated To 700+ Pages!,"I bought this book with great expectations, based on the reviews and cover blurbs- and I was very disappointed. While I enjoyed the last chapter or two, it felt like it took me forever to plod through to them (and I'm a fast reader!). The text bogs down so much at times one is sorely tempted to give up. Better yet, just don't start it...it isn't worth the effort, in my opinion."
2,Zzzzzz.....,"I'm afraid I have to add to the pile of reviews from people who thought this book was a bore. The first couple hundred pages were excellent reading, and because you're reading a book about Dracula you start to think that you are well on your way to something exciting. Well, about halfway through you start giving up on that notion. ""The Historian"" could have been about 200 pages shorter. It got so tedious that I felt like I was reading a college textbook and I should whip out my highlighter and a liter of Mountain Dew to keep myself awake. To be honest I got fed up and skimmed through the 500's. I don't like to give up on a book though, so I did finish it, but I'd really like to have the time I spent reading this book BACK."
5,Infinitely Better Than Dan Brown,"No, Kostova is no Dan Brown and thank goodness! Her writing style is much more sophisticated, her plot here is much more enthralling and considerably less formulaic. In short, unlike Brown, she doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator.The story has been rehashed here enough -- it is all about the search for the historical Dracula, and while the 600+ pages may be intimidating for some it is worth the time and effort. But be forewarned -- if you've read Dan Brown you'll finally understand what a waste of time that was once you've finished this gem."
5,superbly entertaining . . .,engaging and intriguing from the start. you wish there were another 100 pages to go.
5,Enthralling,"Most of the reviews I've read of this novel are critical of the length mainly. Personally, I don't think she could have told this story any other way and I wouldn't wanted her to cut anything out. Its an incredible tale spanning centuries and vast distances and introduces many important and varied characters. This book is for lovers of history as well as those devoted and efficient speed-readers out there (you cant zone out for a spell and then snap out of it expecting not to need to backtrack). Anyway, this is one of the greatest tales I've ever read and I'm so grateful I stumbled upon it. Its a book for people who love to read, not just one to casually jump in and out of."
2,Forget it by the pool,"I won't go into all the plot holes and weaknesses of this book, they have already been mentioned by A. Lewis in his review.I think of 'The Historian' as a book you want to like, because the narrative is flowing and the writing is decent, but you can't like it, because you feel that it's just missing something.Besides, I had the uneasy feeling that the author's historical knowledge is presented as if it were taken straight out of Wikipedia."
3,A good read while on a long journey,"I decided to buy this book after reading the first 2 pages. Won't rate it 4 as I think the very little details are a bit boring; the story itself is amazing and so does the description of the places the narrator visited. And of course reading it alone in midnight gives one a more ""exciting"" experience."
4,Can't wait for her new book!,"Perfect vampire/adventure book with an intense cat and mouse chase intertwined with love, mystery, and evil."
3,Ok,"I have been trying to finish this book since the end of July....it is an ok book, but I guess the subject just couldn't hold my interest. I found out some interesting pieces of information about Eastern Europe and vampires, but couldn't continue.A professor has disappeared, and one of his assistants goes to Eastern Europe to look for him...it is a thriller, but it just couldn't thrill me enough to finish...I did get through 3/4 of it, but have definitely lost interest...vampires, Dracula, Vlad the Imapler.I guess I read too many other books in between...fantastic writing by the author, though."
4,good book,i really liked this book because it tied history with fiction of vampires. It was very interesting. good read for anyone looking for something different with an open mind
3,I Really Wanted to Like This Book,"I really wanted to like this book, but in the end, I simply felt ambivalent towards it.The story has a great hook and it pulls you in at the beginning, but then just seems to let you go.Without getting into plot specifics, I have two primary criticisms, (1) If you go out of your way to attempt to establish the intellectual ""brilliance"" of your main characters, have them be able to see the obvious connection between events or, at the very least, question whether there is a connection between the events. At no point in the book does a single character question the source of, or reason behind, the ""Dracula"" books mysteriously left with them. And, (2), if Dracula is powerful enough to orchestrate all of the events in the book, why does he not simply kill the heroes when they get too close (he operated a bit too much like a 007 villian, ""I will now leave you in this elaborate trap but not wait around to see you die"")."
1,Quite literally one of the worst books I've ever read.,"The thought that kept going through my head as I read was: how did this get published? I'm sure worse first novels have been written. But was the editor out of red pencils when he/she read this manuscript? It's far too long and poorly told.There's a dictum in storytelling: show, don't tell. Repeatedly the author tells us that some character's ""blood ran cold"" upon reading some passage in a book, while I, the reader, found the new revelation to be perfectly boring.As for the book's surprises... they were so clearly telegraphed beforehand, so utterly obvious, that the only people who could not see them coming from a mile away was the characters themselves.I truly believe that were it not for the wild success of The Da Vinci Code, this book would never have been published.A warning to any intelligent reader: don't bother."
3,I Had High Hopes...?,"This book is beautifully written. I felt at times that I was reading classic mystery while sitting infront of a fireplace on a snowy, overcast day and drinking hot chocolate. The only flaw to this scene was that there was more atmosphere than ""meat"" to this novel. The book should have been titled the ""Searchers"" because that's what the characters did in the novel. I wanted something to be resolved.I was never bored however and I did enjoy the book.I also felt cheated ,although I now want to go to Romania and Bulgaria. It's a fun book.In summary, I recommend this book , but don't expect greatness."
2,You'd Spend Your Time Better Cleaning Out A Closet,"Horrendously overlong. Enough plot for maybe a 250-page book. Some chapters are beyond plodding. Some plotpoints are so obvious, you'll get them 100 pages before the lead characters do. The final showdown is less than jaw-dropping. There are moments, but moments are dwarfed in a tome 641 pages long.Dracula would go thirsty if he were depending on Kostova for bloody thrills."
2,Some people just don't know when to stop,"Overall the first 3/4 of the book were enjoyable; however, we reached a resolution at a startling pace. With such a long build, you would have expected a more satisfying resolution. I could live with that; however, some people just don't know when to stop. Had the book ended with no epilogue, I would have given it 3 or 4 stars. The epilogue called the resolution of the story into question and made me feel like I had wasted my time reading the previous 634 pages."
1,"Stick characters, weak plot",The prose and descriptions are good but the characters are one dimensional and the plot is almost non-existent. It could have been told in 1/3 the number of pages.
3,Two dimensional characters,"Kostova obviously has spent a great deal of time researching this book, so the geographical/historical references are very detailed--so much so that they are very long, taking away from a novel's first focus--the characters. I was very interested in learning more about an area of the world about which I knew very little--but I never felt engaged by the characters, who seemed very two-dimensional. Since I tend to love books BECAUSE of their characters, I found myself skimming the end of the book because the people were so predictable.I admire the scope of her work--but she really IS more of an historian than a novelist."
4,Good Story,"Elizabeth Kostova has an excellent tale to tell in this novel. I've never read a book quite like ""The Historian."" I could have done without so much description of European architecture, and alot of the history. The pursuit of Dracula was page-turning and some of the touches of history were very interesting.However, the manner in which she tells this tale leaves something to be desired. Her writing style is excellent, and it is obvious that she did a great deal of research. I wanted to love this book as I have some other books such as Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell and The Crimson Petal and the White.Too much history bogs the story down and at times is quite boring. I would recommend this book, for the overall story is terrific."
2,Skip the Unabridged CD version,"With all the hype about this book, I couldn't wait for the audio version since I listen to audiobooks while commuting. The abridged version is dicey...hard to follow and sometimes downright confusing. I don't know why an unabridged version isn't available. Save your money!"
4,Good but not great,"Overall I enjoyed this book, but it was somewhat hard to get into initially. The beginning of the book jumps around somewhat, and there is very little dialogue to keep the reader interested. Once the father starts to really tell his story, the book becomes much more interesting and I enjoyed it much more. However, I found the ending to be a little disappointing, like the author had to come up with an ending so she just ended it with the first thing that came to mind. I also didn't think the Epilogue was necessary. If you can get passed the first couple chapters and into the main story, the book is worth the read."
4,A Pleasant Diversion from the Real World,"This book was certainly a page turner. The author did an impressive job of tying all of the charaters together and getting the reader to care about their relationships and fates. I loved the world travel in the book as well, although the author did tend to get a bit long-winded in her descriptive narratives. She easily could have shaved 200 page off of her book in description alone. The mystery was very intriguing although I do have to agree with some of the other reviews that the ending was a bit...well...unusual. Nonetheless, the book is definitely worth your time."
4,long story,"If you are looking for an advanture and fast-pace novel, it's not the one. If you're a vampire-hunting fan, it'd give you a different perspective from the other books.It's also a good way to learn the East Europe. There're many detailed descriptions about the people and towns there.Overall, this book is a little bit flat for me. Maybe I was expecting to get some exciting advanture experiences from reading it."
2,I was disappointed,"This book wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The beginning dragged, the changing narrator was sometimes confusing, and the plot twists became fairly obvious if you looked closely enough. It's almost as though Kostova was attempting to mirror Bram Stoker's style but couldn't quite figure out how to make it work. If you can read another book, go for it."
2,Did Not Live Up to Hype!,"I pre-ordered ""The Historian"" based on the description on Amazon.com and an article I had read about Elizabeth Kostova. I was intriqued by the comparison to ""The DaVinci Code"" and the fact that she had received a $2,000,000.00 advance for her first novel. When it arrived, I expected it to be a ""can't put it down until it is finished"" book, instead I found that it was a ""have a hard time picking it up"" book. I found it boring, slow-moving, repetitive, and lacking in suspense and horror. I wish I had waited for the paperback version and saved money - or better, checked it out of the library. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!"
1,Good Grief What a Waste of Time,"I slogged through this book because a friend said it was the best book she had read all year. This has got to be one of the most poorly written book I have run across in a long time. There were three stories woven together. The author was not skilled in weaving these plots seamlessly. They were choppy, hard to follow and just plain boring. I seriously could not stand this book. Now, I have to fudge to my friend and say I liked it (well, I'll tell her it was ok...but, I promise I won't gush over it). Really, if anyone is thinking of reading this it's a huge waste of time!! Huge!"
3,"Longer than it looks/needs, but otherwise good","It was a good read. A little longer than it needed to be. One chapter just went on and on like a high school textbook. The book went on forever, then the end seemed to come out of nowhere. I'm glad I read it, but wouldn't recommend it to just any friend."
5,Loved this book!,"It was a fantastic read; absolutely riveting. I couldn't put it down! While the ending seemed a bit too ""convenient,"" the storyline was good and the characters were strong."
5,"Oh, what a novel!","Applause to Miss Kostova for The Historian. This novel has everything that a novel should have: mystery, love, suspense, i didn't want it to end. I must admit, there were times when i was reading this novel that my hair was standing up on my neck, i am not quite sure why, i credit the brilliant writting and the detailed description of certain events in the book. I cannot praise this book enough, so i urge you reader, go ahead and read the Historian, you won't be dissapointed."
2,Finally made it to the end!,"This book is dry, dry, dry! It could have been a marvelous book - the concept was intriguing - but it was VERY slow moving. I'm disappointed I spent my hard eaned money on it."
2,Drags in Middle,"I really wanted to like this book! It has been a long time since I have read a book that I could not put down, and with all the hype that surrounded the release of this novel, or tome, I had high hopes for many sleepless, page-turning nights. This book starts off well, but drags on excruciatingly in the middle for about 200 pages. By the time I finally reached the end of the story, I did not care if they found Vlad or not."
2,Complete snoozer,"The major problem with this book is that it is just plain dull. ""Historian"" is a play-by-play of each character's bone-dry life. So-and-so goes to the bathroom. So-and-so puts her hand on his shoulder. So-and-so stares forlornly at the painting. Not only that, but the payoff is bankrupt. At least with the plot-shallow ""Da Vinci"" we have a sprint and come across the finish line feeling like we accomplished something. With ""Historian,"" the only thing we accomplish is burning a few calories for having to carry around a tome of this size.Kostova needs to learn how to do a little more plot blooming as it happens, instead of waiting entirely until the end. It's okay to reveal key facts and let the audience know that they're key as they happen, instead of just rehashing the same facts over and over ad nauseum to string us along until the end. She needs fewer words, a better editor, and a sense of pacing.Verdict: good for weigh lifting, bad for entertainment."
1,NSG,"Well my first impression from the reviews was this book would keep me on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, reading this book was anything but interesting. I am in a book club with co-workers and it took everyone 3 months to finish the story. I kind of gave up at the end when it keep dragging on and relied on my co-workers to fill me in. This may have been good for some but I rate it NSG--NOT SO GOOD."
2,"author in love with her words, not the plot","it was late last night that i decided i will either force myself to finish this book or i never will. i started skimming and scanning thru the last 200 pages, not giving a damn anymore to the endless, frivolous, minutely detailed describtions, or facts for tt matter. ms. kostova is just in love with every word she types, and in doing so, she sacrifices tempo and momentum in such a plot, where flipping thru pages as fast and breathless as one can should be the prime concern with a brick novel as this one.also, ms. kostova seems to be quite under the effect of his bulgarian husband when it comes to formulating a stand point for the region's history and politics."
5,An Amazing Work,"This book is beautifully researched, written and delivered. The suspense and mystery are engaging, and the characters real and multidimensional. A great, great work."
4,Interesting but Far Too Long,"I have never been scared by the size of a book, but I will have to admit that this one took me a while to read.Kostova weaves a very interesting bit of fiction that is all the more entertaining because you feel it could be true. It is, of course, compared to the Da Vinci code because of its' use of historical fact and places along with the character of Dracula. Kostova's writing is much stronger than the Da Vinci code, but I feel at times she was not editted well. The novel drags in parts because it was not cut of some of the superfulous material. Just because the parts are well written doesn't mean that they shouldn't be cut down to create a more concise and cohesive story.I disagree with a lot of the other reviews in that the ending, to me, was completely acceptable. This was a good read, albeit long."
5,A Suspensful Journey,"This was a fabulous and intriguing novel. I see no need to rehash all the details that so many others have pointed out. Suffice it to say that it is a NOVEL (i.e., a work of FICTION), and is wonderfully put together. It has great characters and is a stupendous tale. Woven in with it is some fascinating history of the real Vlad Tepes and his battles with the Ottoman Empire. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Entirely too long,"I did enjoy the story line and the development of the characters, but I thought it could have been much shorter. I have to agree with other reviewers that the focus became more about the research process than was necessary. Overall, a good story but you don't miss much to skip the monk migration stuff."
4,Thrilling!,"When this book came out last year, it was acknowledged as one of the most awaited novels of the summer. I read an excerpt online and couldn't wait for it to come out.With such high expectations, the question to ask is..did it measure up?? I would say it did...for the most part. At times, I found the author was perhaps trying to create too eerie an atmosphere, to the point of being unnecessary.Otherwise, the story is amazing. The history behind Vlad the Impaler and the surrounding folklore and myths is absolutely captivating. The geographic locations Kostova takes the reader to are exotic and mystical;Romania ,Hungary and its political ties. These aspects of the book were expertly interwoven into the plotline, which was fast-paced and gripping. The characters got more interesting and provided more depth to the story as the book went on. A great read!"
5,Engaging Story,"This took me awhile to finish, but I got excited everytime I returned to this book. The characters are rich and the story is very engaging. I will definitely read this book again and I am glad to have it in my vast collection of wonderfully written stories."
4,Short Sweet Reveiw,Good alover but VERY slow at times and at others ExTrEmElY suspensful.Good read but be ready to donate a few months to read it. Its slow going.
3,Well written . . . but,"The Historian is a very well written book, but unfortunately it is very tedious. It is one of the best books that I COULD ever put down. It was very much lacking in suspense. Yes, I would wonder what would happen next, but not enough to try and plough through the tedious description. I had to rest up and read other fare between chapters. Could have been great - a wonderful idea, but just too tedious. That is three tediouses if you are counting."
3,Pretty good read,"...yet not brilliant. I found some of the twists predictable and foretold. Some passages too lengthy and some, not enough. I was dying to meet dracula, pardon the pun...but for all the tease i wished we had more confrontation and character development of him. One showdown was excellent and you feel the power thru the page.You definitely appreciate the characters in this story and feel for them, particularly Paul and Helen, let alone Rossi and some of exotic scholars along the way. Yet there was an opportunity missed to delve more into the psychological here. Mind you I am not a fan of Dracula, but I enjoyed the clues, the historical context and the pursuit. Just that when we got there the resolution was rather swift, abruptly dissapointing. More like 3 and 1/2 stars."
