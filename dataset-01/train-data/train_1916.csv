5,"Stunning, dazzling, every synonym of these words describe this doll","This Phoebe doll is very stunning. Her elegant top makes true collectors jaw drop. Her skirt is silver, black, and very flashy. Her shoes are oh-so-dazzling. The hair is very silky, but not greasy. The earrings look very grand, sparkling in the light. The smokey eyes look absolutly marvolous with her skin complection. And last, but not least, the lip color is flawless. I admire this doll every day, and I highly recommend this to you."
2,LOOKS MUCH BETTER ON THE COMPUTER!,THIS DOLL IS THESE THINGS BELOW!.........1.VERY SLUTTY!2.NOT THAT CUTE!(GET CLOE)3.SHE LOOKS WAY BETTER ON THE INTERNET!4.HER SHIRT DOES NOT STAY UP!(I HATE THAT PART!)5. HER HAIR IS CRAZY AND FRIZZY!6. DONT BUY HER!!!!
4,Phoebe,"This Phoebe is one of the best. This Phoebe has really nice curly hair and a great outfit. Another good doll in the Birthday Bash collection is Sasha, she has very cute hair. K3L7M5"
1,Batteries and Charger did not work.,"The price was right, but when the product arrived, it didn't charge the included batteries. I bought a replacement Eveready charger at Target. It indicated that the batteries were bad. New Eveready rechargable batteries failed to charge in the Maximal Power charger, but charged in the Eveready charger. It appears that both the Maximal Power charger and batteries that I purchased were bad. Zero stars."
1,Not interested,Worst and dead slow in returning... Totally I hate such attitude... Worst and dead slow in returning... Totally I hate such attitude...
2,Batteries don't hold a charge... :(,"Batteries don't hold a charge, not sure if it's the charger or the batteries themselves... Not at all satisfied with the product."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I had read other people's reviews way back when I ordered this. Like so many other people I saw this as a recommended accessory for my new camera. The charger does not charge these batteries, or ones that I know are good. Nor will these batteries charge in another charger. Junk and more junk. Only wish I had tested them out when I first got them so I could have returned them."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!,What a waste of eight dollars. Batteries won't last for more that a couple of pictures even without using the flash. I wish I could give this product zero stars. And I wish I had my money back.
2,weak batteries,This wasn't worth the price. I bought this as an accessory for a Canon A590 camera which requires 2 AA batteries. The charger has no indicator for when batteries are fully charged. After charging overnight the battey life was very short in the A590 - could not be 2700mAh capacity.
2,Short life batteries,"I purchased these rechargable batteries to use in a digital camera. They do not hold their charge very long. After about 24 hours, and not that many photos, the low battery indicator comes on."
3,Decent Product,"It feels a little cheap, and didn't really come with any instructions, but not hard to figure out. I just wish it had an indicator to when the batteries were fully charged."
1,Don't buy this charger,"I bought the charger before the Pure Junk review was posted - wish I had waited! The AA batteries won't even stay in the charger, so no wonder they don't charge. I bought a Canon camera for my son, and this charger was ""recommended"" by Amazon - what a disappointment. Why did Amazon suggest something that is truly junk?"
1,Junk,"I should have known with the price for this charger and batteries that they wouldn't be high quality; but they are absolute trash! The fully charged batteries last barely an hour and a half and that's with the LCD screen on my Canon As 590 set to turn off after 10 seconds of non use. Canon says fully charged batteries should last for 400 pictures, these last for less than 100. It may be partly the camera, but my four year old Duracell NiMH last two times longer than these do. I easily get 200 pictures with the old Duracell 2050mAh batteries. These Maximal 2700mAh are nowhere as good. I'm being kind giving these even one star. Buy better batteries and save money in the long run.Bill"
2,Jury Still Out,I bought this as a part of my camera purchase. The batteries do not seem to last as long as I thought. There were no clear instructions as to how long it takes for a full charge.
3,cumple su función,cumple su función pero lo unico negativo es que tarda 24 horas y mas en cargarse por completo
5,Proof that King's X had something to offer the industry,"Gretchen, the sophomore effort by Doug, Ty and Jerry, proved that they had the licks, the lyrics and the guts to stick. And thank goodness. An all around fantastic album.The first song, ""Out of the Silent Planet"" is monstrous, just gigantic, one of their best ever. Other standouts include: ""Over My Head"" which Doug later reveals was inspired by his lack of mother and father and a grandmother who raised him but never showed him love, ""Summerland"" pure and simple perfection, period, ""Everybody Knows A Little Bit Of Something"", ""Pleiades"" about the philosopher who was burned at the stake for saying the world was round. All other songs round out the album nicely and do little to detract from the truly great tracks."
5,Classic must have!,A friend turned my onto these guys back in the day. there's nothing more I can say except BUY IT. It's worth it.
4,GGTN,"Despite the silly title, King's X and their music is serious stuff. The boys are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all-time, yet still unknown to your average music fan. GGTN is hailed as the band's masterpiece by most people who care. Although you cannot count me as one of those, this is still a great album with no weaknesses. ""Over My Head"" has become a live classic over the years. All the songs are top notch, and as with any King's X music, buy it if you can."
4,THIS BAND WAS NOT HAIRY,"IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS BAND HAD THE NERVE TO PUT OUT GREAT PROGRESSIVE HARD ROCK DURING THE HAIR BAND ERA. WHILE PEBOZO WAS OUT BUYING WINGER AND CINDERELLA ALBUMS, THIS BAND WAS PUTTING OUT TERRIFIC MUSIC. THANK GOODNESS FOR THESE GUYS OR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LITTLE MUSIC TO LISTEN TO IN THE LATE 80S. AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A LOT OF HAIR, THESE GUYS WERE NOT HAIRY AS IN HAIR BAND."
5,One of rock musics greatest recordings!,"King's X is one of those bands. If you've heard of them, you're a die hard fan. If you haven't, you're not. Like the other bands in the ""Houston Trio"", Galactic Cowboys and Atomic Opera, King's X has yet to make a dissapointing record. Maybe a bad song now and then. But overall each recording is a work of art. Particularly the early stuff. And especially Gretchen. You can't go wrong with a King's X CD."
5,Amazing piece of History,"I as very surprised at the quality of this scale model car.I children are facinated by it as well. That was the reasonfor the purchase-Its historical value.It was after all, a crime scene.The detail is fantastic right down to the carpeted trunk.I am more than pleased with this purchase."
2,Nightgown,"This was a pretty nightgown, but was too sheer & it didn't show that on the picture. Maybe someone else would like it, I just don't care for see-thru nightwear."
4,Lovely and soft,This is so beautiful. It feels so GOOD! I love it and I'm sure you will love it also.
5,Love this Silk Essence gown,"It's impossible to find these gowns in a department store although that's where I first bought one. Let me tell you there is a huge difference between Miss Elaine's Silk Essence and anyone's tricot. I with they'd come out with some more colors because I have to keep ordering aqua and pink over and over. And that's what I'm about to do now. They are delightfully cool and comfortable to sleep in...not clammy and clingy like tricot. You'll love it, I guarantee."
1,see thru,I very rarely send things back but this is one of them.From reviews thought might be a little sheer but this is see thru and a very flimsy cheep feeling material.Entire nightgown could probably fit in a regular envelope!Can find better gowns at a discount store!
5,Rare Ray Charles,"This is a wonderful album, two disc package.This recording has a lot of soul...i guess that is why they called it 'Soul Brothers'.Ray Charles is just such a soulful player on any instrument, but when he plays saxophone on 'Soul Brothers' you can almost feel him crying into that horn. I am sure Saxophone professionals would think that it lacks the tone of say Charlie Parker, or the smoothness of Stan Getz, but it wails like an old blues ragtime session in a cane field. It has feeling, its got a lot of soul.Milt Jackson on vibraphone adds that 'jazz' idiom to the recording and Milt also plays guitar on one of the tracks.The whole album flows really nicely from beginning to end.It is relaxing.it is soul-jazz by some of the finest musicians to ever grace us.if you know you will always like jazz and blues with soul, buy this double album it is a gem.thankyou Ray and Milt, timeless stuff."
2,Dull and repetitive,"The good news is this game only cost about 5 dollars. Other than that, not much good to say. On the good side, the graphics are very well done, with attractive rendering and details, and nice iron sites on the weapons.The bad:The enemy doesn't move too much, except when they are scripted to do so. You can sit forever in one position and keep shooting or just hide - they will never come look for you.So far (I have gotten about half way through the game) you don't get to drive vehicles, fly planes, etc. Compared to BF and Medal of Honor, this is a disappointment.As other reviews said, you basically just shoot and move. This gets rather repetitive very quickly, especially since the computer seems to just sit around (though perhaps that's my difficulty level).The missions are basically get from point A to B, by flanking.For 5 dollars this game is fine, but I wouldn't spend much money or time on it overall."
2,What is this????,"Excluding the graphics, it looks like this game came out in 1998. I was not impressed with it at all. I got tired of it after 10 min. First of all when you shoot at the enemy, is it just me or when you hit them, they kneel down and heal. Oh yeah, those enemey locaters are anoying. It takes several rounds to kill the enemy when your at range and the aim of the gun it terrible, it moves around a lot. The whole concept of ordering the troops is nice but it could have been better. The only thig I did like was the new graphics and character textures, it looked real almost. Anyway Call of Duty sure takes the prize over this game. All I have to say to the developer is ""BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME"""
1,brother in arms road to hill 30,This game is not too bad. It has some issues like trying to hold a weapon steady. I am at a chapter were i have to take out a Panzer tank using a german rocket launcher. It does not work as i have tried 20 or 30 times. This problem does not allow you to go to the nest chapter. If you want to send them a email forget it there is no email address. The only help is question and answer. I think my cd-rom is bad. I have Brother In Arms Hells Highway and it is a great game with no problems.
2,save money,"Game has no quick saves,enemy shots are always accurate,yours are not.Enemy shots go thru solid surfaces.As combat vetern of Vietnam this game is not realistic."
4,Dumb Reviewers,"First off, Kyle, a GeForce 4 MX420 is not ""a very common video card."" In fact, it's an outdated one that can't even handle the best games that are out there today.Secondly, I don't know what your source of bugs/crashes are, but for the other people reading this, you should go to www.gamerankings.com and search for BiA. Read those reviews too as well as user reviews. Heck, go to any forum and they'll sure be talking about this. I prefer reading forums at hlfallout.net (there is an official thread about this). So far, it's a mixed review with some people liking it and others hating. It's hit or miss with this game.The graphics are a little old- it's based on the OLD Unreal engine. That sucks. Gee, in hindsight, I should have given this game a three star rating for mediocre. Gameplay gets repetitive after a while, though it's nice to have something a little bit more realistic (in terms of team tactics, layout of battlefield, etc.)."
4,DVD workaround and then it works great!,"Just got the game, installed perfectly fine on my DVD player, went to start the game .... no go. The copy preventative encoding causes some DVD problems and the game will NOT allow one to play, even though the game installed on the same DVD!Went to forums to see if there was a workaround, and YES, there is. Google searched ""no CD"" patch for BIA and went to a site where I downloaded and unpacked a revised BIA.exe file which I copied into my installed, updated (1.10) game and replaced the original BIA.exe. All is fine ... game starts and plays without the need to have the DVD inserted. Hope this helps!"
1,Don't buy if you have a 6600GT PCIExpress,"I can't even install this game as it fails on install claiming that I don't have a video card. Maybe they forgot that not everyone is still using AGP cards (or maybe it is my 64 bit AMD proc)? Either way, tech support has been slow in getting back to me. If you are using newer hardware, you are rolling the dice on $50."
1,Technology Issues,"This game has severe technology issues, especially pertaining to video cards. It does not run on certain very common video cards such as the GeForce4 MX 420. I wasted my money on this game that I now cannot play unless I buy and install a brand new video card. I have heard of other problems such as constant crashing, as well. My advice to you would be to research your system specs and make sure you can run the game. Unless you're a tech geek with a ton of customized specs or someone with a very new computer, it probably will give you trouble."
1,old game,Why is this game being advertised on television as if it is a new game? It is a year old and apparently a port to the PC.
4,Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 [Download],"After playing all the Call of Duty Games over & over, I decided to start looking for different 1st person shooter games. Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 [Download] from Amazon's Digital Downloads options is where I began. While this game is not even close to the caliber of the COD games, I still found it interesting and enjoyable. Recommended."
5,A Man Indifferent to Living,This was an excellent story. It was well paced and kept the reader engaged throughout the story. You couldadele the tension as the gunfighter realizes he is facing a man more afraid of backing down from the challange than dying I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy well written and realistic western stories.
1,Formating changes make this a challenging book to read,1. The overwhelming amount of format changes since '94 edition were unnecesary and confusing. Reference books such as these need a standardized format to allow for easier access to information. 2. Removal of many convenient tables and charts make this book less useful. 3. Calculations too complex to be of practical use. Complexity will certainly lead to errors.
5,Excellent Resource Book,"For anybody in the construction, engineering, design, or code enforcement/verification fields this book is a must. It is an excellent reference & resource book with tons of valuable information."
5,My daughter doesnt move!,"I play this when we are on trips in the car and my 20 month old daughter is sooo tuned into this show! The only time she moves is to sing along when they sing. She imitates them laughing when they say the people on the bus laughs and then its right back to gazing at the screen. She loves this show and when i play it, she claps excitedly! Definitely has made driving around with her easier. Would recommend for sure too!"
5,Nice DVDs for 1 year & above,"I was apprehensive about buying DVDs for my 1.5 year old at first but he used to be so interested in these songs on youtube, so i decided to try it out.He likes to watch them everyday & has picked up a lot of words too.It is well made with toddlers & kids in mind. the songs have message about good eating habits, sharing & being nice.I would recommend this DVD everyone."
5,The Bus!,"My 2-year-old daughter loves these DVDs! She says, ""The Bus, the bus, mommy""! Sometimes she wants to watch them over and over. After a while, it starts driving me crazy, but she has so much fun singing and dancing along. I haven't played the CD in the car yet, but I'm sure it will be enjoyed! I highly recommend this box set."
5,The box set is a MUST for birthday gifts!!,"Our family has been following this series since my daughter was 1. I was so thrilled to find something that she loved to watch over and over again... that I didn't mind hearing over and over again. The music is fabulous, and the messages are simple and sweet - every age in our extended family is still watching these DVDs. For adults, having Roger Daltrey as the dragon is a nice bonus. And, Laura Hall's compositions are sweet, catchy, and pure fun for every age.My daughter is now 5 1/2, and she still loves these DVDs. She's not alone!"
5,Great entertainment and fun for all,My 22 month old loves these movies and also plays the cd in the car. Even her 4 1/2 brother loves them.
3,Band strap doesn't engage in loop,"Fine watch for swimming except the nylon strap of the band won't stay in place while swimming, so it flaps loose. It doesn't cause so much of a problem, but its annoying."
3,issue with the belt buckle,"the watch is nice, light and works perfectly, you don't have to take it off on the pool/beach, the night light is cool, you can set 2 times and 2 alarms.......you have to hit a button to see the date : ......now what i didn't like it's the little belt buckle, after 15 days of having the watch no problem until last weekend that i went to a 1 day trip to the beach... by the end of the day i realized that the little rounded metal or aluminium clasp was gone... now i have to use lock it on the pure hole of the band (without the clasp).... besides that nice watch!!!!"
3,Freestyle Watch,"This is a nice watch, we love Freestyle. But...once received looked more like it was intended for wear by a woman or teenage boy...in other words, it was much to small (as in dainty) for my husband."
3,A difficult one,"Although I liked the cover picture and could never give 1 star to anything connected to the Wonder Years, I have to say I was more than a little dissapointed to discover that Fred Savage wasn't singing all the songs. A wasted opportunity."
1,The Wonder Years DVD,THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE. THE SHOW IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!!
1,wheres snuffy,"how can they produce a cd of ""wonder years"" music .. without W.J.Snuffy Walden .... he is clearly responsible for the warm, acoustic melody that underpinned the success of the wonder years...Scott (aged 8 , Uk)"
1,This CD is not Wonder Years!,I bought this CD to listen to one of my favorite songs from the show and what did I get nothing. It doesn't even have the songs that were in the show. It's just songs that they just copied from various oldies CD's. There are maybe a few songs that were in the show in there but most of them aren't. It's a good thing I get to hear the score piece in there it's beautiful but the rest of the songs sucks. Don't even waste your money on the other Wonder Years CD's because most of them are the same as this one. Good thing I got my Kazaa to look at the list of songs that were in The Wonder Years so I can make my own instead of buying these crappy CD's.
3,"I admit, I bought it for ""Peace Train""","I wasn't a fan of ""Wonder Years,"" but when I heard Richie Havens's version of ""Peace Train"" on XM's The Village, I had to find the recording. Frankly, this one song's worth the price of the CD and a 5 star rating from a non-fan.The rest vary. ""For What it's Worth"" by the Buffalo Springfield's always a great addition and so's Joe Cocker's ""With a Little Help from My Friends."" I could have done without hearing Debbie Gibson singing anything and we get two whole songs from her.""20th Century Fox"" by The Escape Club was a lost treasure. So was hearing Carole King doing ""Will you Still Love me Tomorrow.""Overall, I don't regret the purchase. Wish the album was available on a track-by-track purchase, though!Rebecca Kyle, July 2009"
4,Awesome X-Men story,"I like this novel largely for three reasons. First it's an adventure that takes place in the Savage Land and we get to see more of Ka-zar, Shanna, and Zabu. Second it's also a love story between Psylocke and Archangel who are two of my favorite X-Men. Thrid, Dave Smeds is a good writer who wrote an exciteing story here. You litterally can not put the book down until the final chapter. It's that good."
4,Take me back to the savage land,"This novel was thoroughly enjoyable. You have all the elements of an exciting tale. Theres a new twist on an old villain, a plethora of characters, all with respectable contributions to the story, and of course all this is set amidst the fantastic landscape of the Savage Land. X-enthusiasts , get this book, you won't regret it."
3,Average,"A decent read. While not quite up to the quality of ""Smoke and Mirrors"", this novel balances both a love story and an action-packed thrill ride. If you are a fan of Sauron or the Savage Land, then this is a must read."
3,"Nice, but gets a little long near the end","Would have loved to seen more about SCTV, but perhaps some licensing issues prevented that. The Tom Green overview is brief as well, but this is well worth the money."
4,.Hack//sign Review,"To fans of the show, you will more than likely have already made a decision about the musical score. If you haven't seen the show, the best way I can describe it is as world music with female vocals added. Some of the tracks make me think, Renaissance Fair, in that it has the instrumental sounds one might think of. Other tracks have a calm melancholy to them that I found to be very enjoyable. To get a really good idae of the style of music, look for Fiction, also by Yuki Kajiura. It has a couple songs from this cd and it has the same vocalist, Emily Bindiger. That's my rewiew and I hope it helps."
4,Interesting Thriller and Mystery,"I think Killing Britney was a great book, both in mystery and horror/thriller. It was definently a pageturner and I didn't want to set the book down; every chapter left you wanting to continue on with the book. I only gave the book 4 stars however, because it was slightly confusing, especially the end, which I kind of wish had been different. Olin makes it feel as if you really are Britney and you can just picture each and every thing as if it were a horror movie. This book is pretty good, though I would recommend it for ages 13+, maybe even 14."
4,Mysteriously engaging.,"this book is a mystery of its own, Sean Olin has created an engaging plotline with a mixture of different types of characters, from the stuck up populars to the old boring freaky friends. I read this book quickly, i was sucked into the story and really wanted to know what was going to happen next. it was so hard to put down!"
5,amazing!!!!,"I love this book!!! I spent an entire vacation on the beach reading this book instead on playing in the sand because I couldn't put it down. It leaves you guessing after each page. everytime I tried to guess what was going to happen, something totally unexpected would happen. I reccomend this book to everyone, unless you are under 13 because it can have very graphic details. 5 stars!!!!!"
5,"Amazing, I didn't want it to end!",Looking for a murder mystery? This book is crazy-good!!.. I LOVED it!
4,Killing Britney: An enjoyable experience [spoiler warning],"Killing Britney is captivating. It goes beyond the cliched plot of a heroic preppy chick who is the heroine and person who solves the mystery. In fact, the preppy chick is the killer! Loaded with graphic scenes of carnage, imagination unnecessary, but still thrilling. The novel begins like Scream and ends like Hide and Seek."
4,Crazy,"Because I am extremely interested in forensics, I plucked this book off the shelf (secretly i hoped the book was about killing Britney Spears. Its not!) Basically the book is about the grotesque (somewhat explicitly described in the novel) murders of all the people who were close to Britney. The reader is never sure who the killer is, although they may have their suspictions. The alternating narrations of the main characters (including that of the killer) enhance the mystery and suspense. The book did have a handful of grammatical errors, otherwise, it was very unique and a good read. If you're prone to nightmares, read only during the day and in the presence of a very menacing and protective dog."
3,not that good of a book,"i read this book, expecting it to be somewhat thrilling from the looks of the cover, but really the book was a pretty big bore. it didn't keep my on the edge of my seat, and the only reason i kept on reading it was because i didn't want to waste my money. i give it three stars though instead of two, since the ending was actually not to bad, it managed to surprise me."
4,"""Killing Britney""","It was very unexpecting, and page turning. Some parts were extremely unneeded. It was deep, easy to follow, but at the end, sorting everything out took a while. A lot of it didn't make much sense, until the end, and thats why a lot people might have dropped it. It was interesting and I read it in 3 hours, today. I only gave it 4 stars, because it took too much time sorting everything out, and i had to go back and reread pages a couple of times. But the book is very interesting, and it does make you wonder. I thought this book was going to be boring, because I thought I knew the solution, but it changes in the last 3 pages. Its a good read, I recomend it for people 13+ anyone under that, wont understand it."
2,Definately Meant For the Younger Crowd,I normally enjoy the Young Adult genre yet I really just didn't enjoy this book. I didn't finish it for it wasn't interesting to me. I'm not sure if it was the writing style or the style but I wasn't a fan. Everything is given away at the beginning and the characters were oddly developed.
1,Very disappointing,"I put this book at the top of my wish list, hoping to find in it a history of the development of writing in Sumer and a description of how the writing system operates. Instead I found a long-winded, repetitive discussion in the French philosophical tradition of the nature of reality and whether writing is a ""different language"" than speaking. More than half the book is spent deriding other French authors. The main thesis of the book, delivered with great rhetorical finesse and little or no evidence, is that writing did not develop gradually but was ""invented"" suddenly as a full-blown system."
2,Frustrating,"I purchased this program to supplement my introductory Spanish class. The lessons COULD be very useful but I find the male speaker, Alberto, extremely frustrating. He speaks so rapidly and unclearly that I just become annoyed with the entire process. At this point I realize it's time for a different program altogether."
4,recommended for new homeschoolers!,"If you are new to homeschooling and your child is gifted, this book is a must-have. The different styles of homeschooling are reviewed and presented in an objective manner. The first section of the book deals with gifted children and why homeschooling is an ideal solution for many. The next section helps you to find your homeschool style, and the final portion is a resource guide. Informative quotes from kids and parents are liberally sprinkled through the text. Go ahead and borrow it from your public library, but you're going to want to buy it after you see it!"
4,Great Book!,"I borrowed ""Creative Home Schooling..."" from our local library in search for information about homeschooling, I have since read a few other books, but this is by far the best one I have found. it truly answered most of the questions I had about homeschooling, from why should I homeschool to which curriculum is best for my children. It explains in detail concepts such as giftedness; social,intellectual and emotional needs when homeschooling; learning styles; how to get started in homeschooling; and details the most commonly used curriculums: unschooling, self-directed learning, individual subjects, classical, etc. Due to the great amount of good information I decided to buy it and I have not regretted it! Great resource."
4,Improve Your Skill Set,"From my experience, broker training differs from firm to firm, but usually brokers have to educate themselves. There are many books written about residential real estate brokerage, but few about commercial real estate brokerage. This is a great book that teaches brokers all the necessary steps required for success in commercial real estate sales.As a former broker at one of the national brokerage firms, I was always amazed how unprepared new brokers were for the job. They were taught a few tactics and told to get on the phone and meet with clients. I don't understand why so few of them read books such as this one to gain an edge and increase the chances of success. If you are an experienced or beginning real estate broker, you will find this book helpful.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,All on ONE Disk.,Blu Ray is good on El Mariachi considering the source was fair at best. Still looks better than DVD. Desperado was great in Blu Ray format.My complaint is BOTH are on ONE DISK. I would be OK with two disks in one holder but there is something wrong with putting both on one disk. It was originally listed as a double pack but now is listed as a double feature. I don't see where it says these are on one disk. BIG BUMMER.
1,Not worth the time,"I have seen a lot of bad movies in my day....and so I can tell you this is one of them.No redeeming value, no great film making, borderline high school play quality acting...terrible cinematography.Besides that you might like it."
5,If you love dogs then this is the book for you!,"Because of Winn-Dixie is about a young girl named Opal who finds a dog she gets to keep and names it Winn-Dixie. In the book Opal meets some new friends. I liked this book because it was very descriptive. It's a very short book but has a lot to say. I recommend this book to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders.Opal is always meeting new friends but Winn-Dixie is her best friend. I rate this book five stars because it is a great book, and it was fun to read. It only took me a few days to read Because of Winn-Dixie because I could not put it down. It is a great book!!"
4,One Sweet Dog!,"The book I am reviewing is Because of Winn Dixie.I liked the relationship between Opal and Winn Dixie.My favorite charcter in the book was Winn Dixie because he is so sweet to everyone.I also liked the bird, Gertude, I liked the way Gertude always sat on Winn Dixie's head.My favorite part in the book was when Winn Dixie was running around the trailer when there was a thunderstorm.I liked how he was knocking over Opal and the preacher, that was very funny!My other favorite part was when Opal and Winn Dixie were in the pet store and all the animals were running around the pet store.That was a very funny scene!I would recomend this book to little children because it is a more sweet little children's book.It is a book for everyone but, teenagers may not be really be interested in this book.The book in some parts were kind of boring but it is still a very good book.I think that you should read this book."
5,Because of Winn Dixie,"Winn Dixie is the absolute best book in the world when you pick it up you can't put it down if you do your making the biggest mistake of your life. From the very first page there's excitement where a girl named India finds a dog at Winn Dixie grocery mart that's about to die and she shows tremendous love and saves the dogs life, because of that she goes on and make a lot of friends like Mrs. Granny Block, Gloria Dump, and Otis the pet store owner. Later that week a big thunderstorm hits and Winn Dixie runs away. On a scale of one to 10 I would give this book a 12.By Jacob"
5,Because Of Winn-Dixie,"I have read many books in my life but this book Because of Winn-Dixie has been one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend this book to any 4 th, 5 th or 6 th grader. This realistic fiction page turner ,will make you never want to put it down because of all of the heart warming things that happen. If I could of I would of read the whole book in one night , but sense we have to read together I couldn't. You might not think it's a good book because of what the cover looks like but boy you're wrong."
3,Because of Winn-Dixie,I like this book because it has a funny girl and a dog and whenwinn-dixie went into the grocery store and he knockd the manegerend he was crying and when they were going to send him to pound and Opal said that the dog was her's and she took him home.
2,Strange,"I didn't really get this book. A guy got arrested for playing his guitar. A women shaved her sons' hair off because of fleas. Amanda, well she just seems like a snob, even if her brother DID die. Gloria Dump has a tree filled with bottles and jars to keep ghosts of bad things away, that just sounds crazy to me. Sweetie-Pie Thomas, not even CLOSE to a real name. Opal names a dog after a store and noone even notices, except for Gloria Dump who barely said anything about it anyway. The dog wasn't gone a minute, he just hid under a bed. What I DO think is cool about this book is it talks about how people have REASONS to be upset or be mean or be strange. The End. Not a very good book, unless if you like reading this; Blah blah blah. No lie, all it is is conversations and blah-blah-blahing with other people. Seriously! Who would read this book?"
4,great read aloud,"For the past two years, I have read this book aloud to my class, and they have foundit to be spellbinding. They react positively to the author's obvious affection for her characters and the kindness she exudes as she solves her problems. A great read aloud."

4,Because of Winn -Dixie,"I think winn-Dixie is a great book to read. Winn-Dixie is a book about a ten year old girl named Opal that meets a dog. the dogs name is Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie helps Opal find friends. This book is kind of sad,funny,andreally cool."
5,An Amazing Dog Story,"In this amazing story, a girl named India Opal just moved and now she lives in Florida. Opal had no friends until she met a dog which she named Winn-Dixie, the name of a grocery store. Winn-dixie helps opal and the preacher,Opals' dad, make new friends in florida. Opal also got a job at a pet store. Well, I don't like to give away everything, so just read this spectacular book about love and friendship. I rate this book 5 stars because it is one heart-warming, compassionate story."
4,you must read this good book,"Kate, DiCamillo. Because of Winn- Dixie.Cambridge,Massachusetts: CandleWickPress . 2000 182 pp.The story is about a girl that lives in Florida. She walked in Winn-Dixie the grocery store and found a dog. The Manager was going to take it to the pound if nobodytook it . The girl didn't want the manager to take it to the pound so she took the dog and named it Winn-Dixie.* This is a Fiction book but it could happen .* I think that 4th graders and up would like this.* The main characters in this story are Winn-Dixie,Opal ,and her father.* The plot is Winn-Dixie is lost and they can't find her* The story happned in a hot town named Florida* Theme- Opal wouldn't have had any friends or fun and this wouldn't have been a very boring book if she had taken Winn -Dixie to the pound."
3,A short yet overall review,"This is a good book, but not too good. And I have a couple reasons. First of all, the storyline is kind of weak. The ending is a very dissapointing ending. The beginning jumps from one spot without mch detail. A summary might sound like this-India Opal Bologna has been craving for her mom all her life. Now she has a new friend, but can she prevent his loss too?What I am saying is, only read a book like this if you are a dog LOVER, or if you are required to read it. The reason it was a 3 star review was because it is an easy read that helped me with a reading goal."
3,Because of Winn-Dixie,"I give Kate DiCamillo's book Because of Winn-Dixie 3 stars. My favorite character is Winn=Dixie because he is a dog and he did funny things. My favorite part in the story is when a girl named India Opal Buloni went to the Winn-Dixie grocery store to pick up some food. Then an ugly dog came running through the store. The manager told his employees to call the pound and India did not want the dog to go to the pound. So India said that the dog was hers. I would recommend this book because it is funny, but it also is a little bit sad."
5,Great Dog Book for All Ages!,"I am 8 years old and this is a great book for animal lovers. It is about a girl named India Opal Buloni and a dog named Winn Dixie. She finds the dog in a store when she goes shopping for her dad. Read this book, you'll love it!"
5,Because of Winn-Dixie,"This book, I think, was a big insipiration for me because of all the things she does for people that she doesn't even know or like. I think this book was a great book about that you should accept whatever comes up and just go along with it because it's just another bump in the road that you have to deal with and it shouldn't bother you. In this book you really learn about friendship and that you can't judge a book by its cover. You could probably find lots of interesting things that she does for people she doesn't even know, but after a while, she gets to know them and she gets more and more friends by the day. I am suggesting this book to people who love a nice long story about a little girls's life and how it gets better everyday."

5,Sweet With a Touch of Sadness,"Like most Newberry Honor books, this one is as close to perfect as a book can be. It opens with a smelly dog overturning the produce section in a grocery store. From there, the reader is swept up in this bittersweet tale of a lonely girl and a dog with a history. Each chapter introduces another quirky character, like old librarian, Miss Franny Block, who was once visited by a bear. Similar to the candies she gives out in her library, the book is sweet with a touch of sadness. In the end, we learn that healing comes from seeing beneath outer appearances, and making friends.

4,Heartwarming story,"Loved this little book and think it is appropriate & heartwarming for adults as well as children. I loved the characters and the lessons it teaches children. I would buy it for my grandchildren, especially for a child who is having trouble ""fitting in."""
3,FoodieJane,"Light, quick and easy read. A good book for later elementary and middle school kids. Three stars because it might not appeal to everyone, but if you need a fun book to read on vacation and discuss with your kids, this is it!"
4,Because of winn dixie,I like winn dixie because it has a lot of said and happy parts and is intertaning to read. so I think you should read the book.
3,Short and Sweet,"I didn't feel that this book lived up to the hype it's been getting. I've read so many books about plucky misfit girls with weird names, it's practically a genre, and one that has been handled more adeptly elsewhere.The book moves along quickly and simply, and is probably good for kids who might not normally read for pleasure. It's good for sharing with the whole family. But I don't think it's the richly-nuanced piece of literature that so many others seem to think it is."
2,Not for me!,"I just read Because of Winn Dixie with my 3rd grade class. Because of Winn Dixie is a book about a girl named Opal who misses her mom. She adopts a dog and names him Winn Dixie, because that's where she found him. This book is about Opal's summer spent with Winn Dixie and the life lesson she learns along the way. I give this book 2 stars. I didn't personally like the book, but this doesn't mean it's a bad book. One reason I didn't like the book is I don't like dogs or reading about them. Another reason I didn't like the book is it was too slow paced for me. I think elementary students or dog lovers should read this book. Elementary students would be able to relate to Opal and her life experiences. Dog lovers would enjoy reading a book with a dog as one of the main characters. Read this book to find out what happens and to see if you like the book or not."
2,Didn't hold attention,I bought this book for my nine year old daughter. But she did not enjoy it and lost interest quickly. She is an avid reader.
4,Fourth grade book club review,"Our fourth grade book club chose to read Because of Winn-Dixie. We give this book 4 stars because we believe that it shows good examples of every day life problems and how to solve them. it also demonstrates fantastic creativity in how to make new friends in a new place. this book is easy for a fourth grader to relate to because many fourth graders have moved and this book reflects on that type of situation. The main character, India Opal, overcomes obstacles, uses her wit to solve problems and proves why you can't judge a book by its cover which is shown by different characters."
3,WInn-DIxie!!,"winn-dixie was ok. its not my favorite book, but I liked it. opal finds a dog at a grocery store So she takes it home and fixed him up.When winn-dixie get loose on a walk he goes to Gloia's yard and two boys say she is a witch, but Opal does not believe that she is a witch. Winn-Dixie is was a good book!!"
3,Because of Winn-Dixie Review,I gave this book 3 stars for the exciting moments and theadventures.And I really liked the begining and the ending.At the begining I liked it when Opal got to keep Winn-Dixie.And at the end with the drama about Winn-Dixie and Opalsmom.
5,The Great Dog!,"The book ""Because Of Winn-Dixie"" I have to say is the best book. It is about a girl named Opal, who finds a homeless dog at the grocrie store Winn-Dixie. The dog don't look like it is in to good of shape, so she takes the dog home and she is able to keep him. She meets a lot of friends during the story, and a lot of people become friends with a new found friend. She makes him look a whole lot better than he did."
4,Stepanie from Kentucky,"Don't Judge people from the outside judge them from the inside,that is the theme of Winn- Dixie.People missjudge aloy of people who they shouldn't. People miss judged Gloria Dump from being a witch. Really one the inside she is just a lonly sweet laddy. Evan Opal missjudged people, Opal miss judged the Dew Berry boys. She called the mean old bold headed babies, buy really they turned out to be really nice. Almost every one thought Amanda Walkins was a mean little brat, but she just missed her little 5 yearold brother who died just last year."
4,The winn Dixie Review,"At first Opal learned a lesson from don't judge theoutside of someone because the inside they might be good.Opal dose'nt like Amanda at first because she is alwaysso pinched faced.The reason she was pinched faced because the year bbefore her brother had downed.So when Opal found out that Amandas brother drowned then she liked Amanda.When Opal frst got Winn Dixie,she thought he was a dirty dog because he had not much hair and he smelt bad.As theygrew she than loved him very much.At first when she got to Gloria Dumps house she was thougt she was going to be a witch because the Dewberry boys said that she was.When she met Gloria Dump she found out that she was a nice old lady."
5,"My Best Friend, Winn-Dixie","Opal is a very caring and responsible ten-year-old girl. She is caring because she takes care of her dog, Winn-Dixie, and she does her job every week at Gertrude's Pet Shop. Opal looks like her mom because she has freckles and red hair, and she can run fast. Opal is also very good at planting things.Opal's problem in the book is that she has no friends, and she's lonely. Opal is also lonely because she has no mom, and she just moved to a new town. One way the problem is solved is by having a party. Opal and Gloria invited Miss Franny, Amanda and Otis. Another way the problem is solved is that Opal gets a job at Gertrude's Pet Shop and makes friends with Otis.This book was a good book to read because it had a lot of detail in it. Something else I liked is that it was funny and fun to read.Alex Mercurio, 3rd grade (NYC)Rating: five stars"
4,Because of Winn Dixie,"Because of Winn Dixie was written by Kate Decamillo. This heart warming story was adventurous and entertaining. Opal and Winn Dixie met at a grocery store and their friendship began. They go on outings to backyards and to down the street. Winn Dixie and Opal get into tons of trouble. Winn Dixie is really a person in a dog's body. He is very smart. He IS smarter than most humans. When they say a dog is a man' best friend, that applies to woman too. Opal loves Winn Dixie, they have the strongest friendship a dog and a human could ever have. I think that this book is so cute and I would recommend it to any age. I would read this book over and over again if I had the chance."
4,Very entertaining,"I bought this book for my granddaughter, who is 8 years old but reading on a 4th grade level. It is hard to find books that are on her age level but also on her reading level. I read the book before giving it to her for Christmas, and I think it is appropriate both for her age level as well as her reading level. Very well-written!"
5,Not just for Children!,"This book is for anyone who loves a good story with endearing characters! And the characters ARE characters, which is what makes them endearing! It's a fast,easy read... only problem is that you'll wish it didn't end so soon! I am frankly longing for a sequel!"
4,a book of friendship,This book is a great book of friendship and love. Opal makes alot of friends along the way of learning the seceret of friendship.
4,AWESOME book!,"This is a very good, and touching story! It's so good that you might want to read it 5 times! Hope you like it as much or even more than I did!"
5,Because of Winn-Dixie,"i thought the book was really good because love dogs and the book is about a dog. At first i thought i wouldn't like it because i thought the dog was going to get hurt and i don't like sad stories about dogs, but after the third chapter i couldn't put it down.I really started to like the book alot when Opal and Winn-Dixie became best friends and Opal would do anything for Winn-Dixie and Winn-Dixie would do anything for Opal. I really liked it because it has a connection with people who have lost a dog like me. i actually cried because i was thinking of my dog. i think that anyone who loves animals or has a pet would like this book!"
4,Because Of Winn-Dixie Revew,"The story,Because of Winn Dixie was a book that tought the readers a vauluble lesson on how a certian animal,A dog in this case how the canine helps a girl make more friends. This particular book was one of my all time favorites because of the story plot,how alaborate the auothor is about this certian settings,and what is happening in the text. I give Because of Winn-Dixie by Kate Dicamillo a four star because of the particular time period, while i was reading thois book I wast certient about the time period. The questions that came through my mind was, Is this in the 1960's or in the 1990's. That was the only difficulty i had with this book. In closing,this was a exellent wriiten book.Thank you."
4,[...],I thought this was a good book.It was pretty short but was still good. It was about a girl named India Opal Buloni who doesn't have a lot of friends because she just moved and is kind of shy.Then she meets Winn-Dixie and her friend problems start to get solved.
4,A Great Dog Tale!,"This is an excellent example of Realistic fiction for children. This book is not your typical ""dog story."" Kate Dicamillo takes the reader beyond the normal sad dog story. The reader gets into the life of Opal and begins cheering for her and her hopes and dreams. I believe this is one of the best books written for this age because the theme is universal, we all need to learn not to give up regardless of our age. The book is about a young girl who finds a dog and the trials that together they then go through.I definitely like this book better than other dog stories such as Shiloh, Sounder and Old Yeller. They are well written books but Dicamillo takes the reader in a different direction with Because of Winn Dixie and I strongly recommend it."
1,the worst book I have ever read by true book,"Because of winn-dixie is the worst book I have ever read. It is extreemly dull. I had to read it for school. When I saw the cover I thoght it might be a good book. I was very, very wrong. the whole book is about a girl and a dog. They do almost nothing but talk to people. When I saw that they were making a movie I was terribly supprised. It is so boring that if I had to read that thing, I can not call it a book, again I would die. Please do not I repeat do not waste your time reading this thing."
1,WHY???,"Because of Winn Dixie was required summer reading for my son going into Fourth grade. I was curious about the book so I also read it. WHY??? I don't know why of all the wonderful books out there this one was chosen. The story is centered around a little girl who is having trouble understanding why her mother left her. She moves to a new town and it talks of the people she meets. A girl who's brother drowned recently, a prisoner, etc. I found the whole thing rather depressing. And the way it is written runs on and on like my four year old daughter who talks just to hear herself talk. The only thing that actually happened in the book was the dog disappered... but was quickly found. It very much lacked any action or excitement. Also a note to parents there are a couple of curse words in the story... which seemed unnecessary."
3,The Book and The Movie,"The recent movie release of ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" reveals the difference between literary and ""Hollywood"" characters. In Kate DiCamillo's book, Otis is a shy and somewhat grumpy individual, who serenades animals with a guitar. In the movie, Dave Matthews plays a creepy shopkeeper who displays a large hunting knife in the dark back closet of the store when Opal first meets him. The movie version also includes an incompetent cop, who provides only limited comic value; whereas, there is no police officer even mentioned in the book version. Another character scarcely mentioned in the book is the trailer-park owner. However, the movie adds a additional sub-plot by giving the owner multiple lines and a strong distaste for Winn-Dixie. The book creates a more magical and rewarding experience through peculiarity, but the film industry makes ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" just another poorly-made dog movie."
5,REVEIWED BY TJ,I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE THEY ARE CUTE. TIS IS A FICTION BOOK. SHE IS A LOVING PERSON BECAUSE OPAL SAVED WINN-DIXIE.SHE FOUND WINN-DIXIE AT A STORE.
5,Grandparent's Alert Share this with Grandkids,"I listened the book on CD and loved it. It is touching and heartwarming and stars a wonderful dog. If you are a Grandparent like I am, this is a book you will want to listen to or read with your grandkids. Don't miss this one even if there are no children in your life, it is a treasure. Power Path to Love"
5,Because of Winn Dixie,This is an excellent book to be read to prereaders and for early readers on up to adults. Ms Dicamillo has another book 'The Tales of Desperaux' that is fantastic and will be a full length animated feature motion picture being released on December 19th.
4,Becaue of Winn Dixie,Because of Win Dixie is about a dog and a girls relationship with each other. Her dad sent her to Winn Dixie to get some groceries and hears a loud bang and hears a lot of sceaming. She finds a dog and names it after the grocery store Winn Dixie.I can't tell you the rest but I can tell you that this is a very good book and you will enjoy it.
4,A Good Book,"I think the book Because of Winn-Dixe is good book. It is based on a girl named Opal who findes a dog. She falls in love with him. Opal's father is a preacher. Her mom left them when she was very young. Opal finds a way to move on with her life by going through her ups and downs. At the end, Opal learns how to grow up. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a good book to read."
5,An Interesting Story,"I think ""Because of Winn Dixie"" was a great book because there was alot of exciting characters and Winn Dixiewas very funny. Opal also named gets a new dog and named it Winn Dixie because she found it in the store called the Winn Dixie store so she named him Winn Dixie. The book shows tgat some people may want to be your friend even thoughthey are a bit mean. Steve Dunlap and pinched face Amanda are all mean i n the beging of the storybut turn out nice at the end. It also shows that you should never judge people by rumors going around. For example ""Dunlap and steve said that Gloria Dump was a witch but really wasn't."" You should definitally read this book you won't be able to put the book down. I hop[e that you like the book as much as I did.I would also recomend this book to a friend of yours."
5,You'll love it!,"Because of Winn-Dixie was a great book! I give it Five stars! This book was about a girl named Opal that finds a dog that was in the store Winn-Dixie. It was going to be sent to the pound, so she clamed it. Winn-Dixie helped Opal get accustomed to her new home, meet lots of people, and helped her get to know her dad again. This book was so good that I finished it in less that a week! No matter what age you are you will love this book especially if you like dog books. I really recommend it."
5,A gem of a book,"This book will make you laugh (especially when Winn-Dixie smiles), it will make you cry (that India Opal's mother left her). It's a children's book for all ages. I review books, and this is the best one I've read this spring."
4,Because of Winn-Dixie Review,Because of Winn-Dixie Reviewreview created Louise Wagenseilbook by Kate Di CamilloBecause of Winn-Dixie is a very very good book. I love this book. I recommend it for everyone. I love it when Winn-Dixie smiles so much he sneezes. I love it. One example is when Opal just met Winn-Dixie. He smiled and sneezed.Well first of all Winn-Dixie is a dog and what a special dog he is. Because Winn-Dixie can make you have friends. Even your enemies can become your friends. Like the Dewberry boys were enemies to Opal now they're friends.The problem for Opal is that she can't find any friends. But when she finds Winn-Dixie her whole life changes. She gets so many friends and that's all...BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE!!!
3,Because Of Winn-Dixie,"I think that this book is very interesting.This is the first time i've read the book but i have seen the movie once.At first i thought the book was going to be kind of boring but after i read it for a while it actually got good.So like everybody says ""don't judge a book by its cover""!I love winn-dixie i wish i had a dog like him!"
5,The Best Dog in The World,The book Because of Winn-Dixie is a very good book. There was a girl named India Opal Buloni . She found a dog and named him Winn-Dixie . Her daddy [the preacher] said she could keep Winn-Dixie . One day something happened. It was very sad . This book was very good . I would recommend it to people from 4th grade and up.
4,One Dog Changes One Girl'sLife,"There's a girl named India Opal who found a dog. She names it Winn-Dixie. Opal and the preacher (Opal's dad)moved to Namoi,Florida from Waltely. Opal meets some interesting people. One person likes her more than a friend. I recommend this book to an adult and kids. That's how good it is!"
3,Great Book,Language ArtsReview on CharactersWhen Opal found Winn Dixie her life began to be fun and exciting. Winn Dixie changed Opal's life from sad and lonely to happy and not lonely any more because winn Dixie introduces her to some of her friends. One of Opal's friends is Ms. Franny Block.

4,Because of Winn-Dixie the book review,"she found Winn-dixie in a groserie store,as they threatenedto put her in the pound.As India Opal Buloni lied and said thatthe dog was hers.she gave the dog a quick name ""Winn Dixie"".Althrew the dog was a stray,it seemed like it had no owner.later,they made frinds like mrs.Franny W.Block.her great grandfather made the famouse Litmouse lozines.Then the Dewberry boys.they were mean and picked on Opal at first then they soon became friends.She also became friends with Gloria Dump.she also made frinds with sweetie pie a little 6 year old girl.Even threw Opal was having a hard life beause of her mother leaving she still made time to love her father,(the preacher)and to have alot of fun ."
4,Because of Winn-Dixie,I liked this book because it has interesting characters and it has a dog that is funny and the preacher that goes to church and Opal the owner of the dog. My favorite part of the story was when the animals were out of there cages. I also liked when Opal first met Winn-Dixie the dog smelled. And I felt sorry for Opal cause her mom dranked beer . I also liked the book cause Winn- Dixie ran back and fourth in the room.
3,Because of Winn-Dixie,"I give Kate DiCamillo's book Because of Winn-Dixie 3 stars. My favorite character is Winn-Dixie because he is a dog and he did funny things. My favorite part in the story is when a girl named India Opal Buloni went to the Winn-Dixie grocery store to pick up some food. Then an ugly dog came running through the store. The manager told his employees to call the pound and India did not want the dog to go to the pound. So India said that the dog was hers. I would recommend this book because it is funny, but it also is a little bit sad."
5,I re-lived the magic once again!,"I read this book twice, now but it still never goes old. I read it again for summer reading and I actually read the whole book in a day, and forgot how much I loved this story! This book is so beautifully written and fofilled I love to read it, to re-live the magic of the author's capture of Opal's awkward life. I recommend this book for ages 11-14."
5,winn dixie,"I think this book was the best book I ever read because it was almost happy all the way through the book .When the book got realy sad it gained right back up to happyness and it was just a really happy /sad book..so anyone who is reading this or thinking about reading this book you definetly should read the book Winn dixie,and there you go thats why you should read Winn dixie."
5,Summer Reading List,"We were given a list for summer reading. We had seen the movie a few years back at a movie night at church and he remembered it so he chose ""Because"" as one of his summer reading books. He is 9 years old and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have to say I did not have to make deals to get the reading done, he was very enthusiastic about it and read it cover to cover in a week. The friendships that were made lessons learned really got through to him. Very well written and engaging.It was nice to read a book that we both could enjoy and share in discussing."
5,My book review,"The book Because of Winn-Dixie is about a little girl named Opal and her dog Winn-Dixie. In this book Opal makes new friends. The book is awesome. Opal finds Winn-Dixie at the grocery store, brings Winn-Dixie home, and begs her dad to keep Winn-Dixie. He finally says yes! Every day Opal and Winn-Dixie do a routine. First they clean the pet shop for their new friend Otis. After that they go to the library to see Ms. Franny Block. The last stop is Gloria Dump's house, Opal's dearest friend.What the book Winn-Dixie is trying to say is you can make friends just like Opal and Winn-Dixie do. This book is a very good book. You should make friends with anybody you want to.In the book Because of Winn-Dixie I love the fact that Opal becomes happy when she meets Winn-Dixie. I think that anybody would be very happy if they had a dog like Winn-Dixie. A lot of people want Winn-Dixies. Winn-Dixie is able to help other people make friends. I recommend this book to anybody."
5,Read it with your dog,"A short, sweet book about a girl in south Florida and her wolfhound-like stray dog called Winn Dixie. He helps her make friends in her new town and helps several lonely, wounded people reach each other. Touching, easy read. For animal lovers! Read it with your pet! AGes 8+"
5,Because of Winn-Dixie,"In the book called Because of Winn-Dixie there is a girl name Opal Buloni. She moves to Naomi, Florida and lives in a trailer park. This book is a great realistic fiction book that every one would love to read.In the beginning Opal's dad, the preacher, sends Opal to the Winn-Dixie grocery store to get a box of macaroni-and-cheese, some white rice, and two tomatoes. When Opal went in the store she saw the manager was standing there all red-faced, screaming, and waving his arms around and yelling,""Get that dirty dog out of here!!!""Opal thought she saw that dog smile at her. Finally the manager said to call the pound, but Opal did not want to see the dog go to the pound. Opal hollered, ""That's my dog, don't call the pound!"" Opal called the dog and named the dog Winn-Dixie.This is a great book because this book is about friendship between humans and dogs."
5,Winn-Dixie is a WINN-er,"Kate DiCamillo knows how to write poignant books. In Because of Winn-Dixie, Opal opens up to a world she would have never known, had Winn-Dixie never shown up. She meets great characters and you can just see the people and the troubles they have faced. It will make you laugh as well as cry. Great book, I just hope the upcoming movies does it justice."
5,by SS,"A girl name opal was going to the store to get some maccarone for her dad .when she got their the mangorger of the store screming get this dog out of here or I""m going to call the dog pound .Then opal walked in t he store. and the mangorger said is this your dog."
3,Because of Winn Dixie,"This is a book about a girl called India Opal Buloni (strange name) and a dog called Winn Dixie (silly name). They live in Watley with her father. and they move to Naomi,Floride. then Opal meet Otis, a pet shop owner and Gloria Dump, a old woman like the witch. Opal also have some friend are Sweetie Pie and Amanda. She has two bad boy neighbor, are Stevie and Dunlap. in Naomi, there are many event happen. Opal want her mother back them. at last, they have a party in Gloria's house and Opal become friends with Stevie and Dunlap."
3,winn dixie,i didnt really like this book. i wouldnt recamend it. its kind of easy to read. i wouldnt read it again.
3,movie,"They are also coming out with a movie based on this book that will be released in August. Otis, the petstore owner, is played by Dave Matthews. It is directed by Wayne Wang."
2,Nothing Remarkable,"I was still turning the page when the story ended.I couldn't believe it ... the end? Thud!Nothing.Kind of depressing ... this girl yearning for a mother, who will never come back; the lozenges that were sweet and sad, the dog that was almost lost at the end ....Ahhhh ... a nice, clean, trite little story, so, it gets 2 stars for that ...and the dog."
5,Because of Winn-Dixie=Great!!,"This was really a good book! It was also pretty touching. My only complaint was that it was a bit easy to read, but I guess that's great for younger kids!"
4,delightful!,"Delightful, poignant tale of everyday life through the eyes of a tender and fun youg girl who has a constant companion, her dog."
5,Friendships,"I found this to be a comforting book that my ten year old daughter enjoyed. We recently moved to a new area and at first she was lonely but then experienced the happiness of making new friends. As comforting as this book was, right after it, she read an exciting, fast paced book called ""The Wreck of the Ethie"" It was quite a contrast as it is based on a true story of a Newfoundland dog saving people in a shipwreck. ""Winn Dixie"" is slow moving, but poignant...""Wreck of the Ethie"" is exciting & a real page turner. She loved them both, but in different ways."
3,A Too Southern Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read this book and it took me about a month to read it.At first,it was good and then they added more people.Also it has some of the Civil War in it and it makes people think the Confederate army is the good team.I don't recommend this book."
2,Because of Winn-Dixie,"I rate Because of Winn-Dixie a two star book because I liked it but you need to know how it feels to relate to it.I think kids who know how it is to have a dog,or how it is to not have many friends than make some and to go to the liberary and know you will have a friend there or go to the store and meet someone new.Opal can so I can't relate to it as much as say some one with a dog.That's why I give Because of Winn-Dixie a two star rating."
1,Maybe I'm the only person who didn't like this book.....,"I'm a 13 year old girl who read this book when I was 9. I hated it! I was well above my reading level at that time so that probably was part of the reason why I hated it. It was super easy and some parts were extremely cheesy and not real. I mean hello, you can't make 12 friends in a day! You can't help everyone! I think this book was supposed to be read to a 4-6 year old by their mother or father. It was boring and a way to easy read! I think that the author might have wanted to finish the book quickly, because the ending slips and no one really cared! Maybe I'm the only one who HATES this book but I believe it has major faults.~~*AMA*~~-age 13"
2,Sweet Story,A really sweet story but (and I can't believe I am actually typing this) the movie was better.
3,???Book<or>not???,"This book really was not a book, it is a paperback. I give this book three stars. It was not a challenging book <<FACT>>. The book ... The book is what I call a younger brother book<FACT?>.The front page is not what I call attractive. Winn-Dixie looks like a giant rat<<FACT>>. This is my review if you don't agree than you haven't read the book.<<<<FFAACCTT>>>>"
4,You will love this book!,"the book Because Of Winn-Dixie is such a good book i said, ""Mom, I don't want to go to bed!"" Because Of Winn-Dixie is about a little girl named Opal who finds a dog in the store. The people who work there got really mad. Well I can't tell you anymore, you will have to find out yourself. The author tells us that Opal and you can take responsebility for yourself. I think if you read this book you will not want to go to bed too. Just don't see the movie first!"
5,Because of Winn-Dixie,A wonderful cross between TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and OL'YELLER with a happy ending. Be sure to see the movie as well. A delightful romp for adults and children alike.
4,Review of Winn-Dixie,"In this book Opal goes to the store. (It is called Winn-Dixie). She meets a dog and calls it Winn-Dixie. Opal meets a lot of friends because of Winn-Dixie.I learned from this book that you should judge people by the way they are now not in the past. Also in the story Gloria Dump tells Opal to judge Otis by the way he is now.Have you ever read a book that is sad and happy at the same time? Well this book is. Opal in the beginning was sad, but at the end she is very happy because she has Winn-Dixie and Gloria Dump and Otis and so on."
5,Awesome Book!,"In my opinion this was an awesomw book. Opal fond winn dixie in store. The Duebry boys are funny. I like opal a lot and I like dogs. She and Winn Dixie made a lot of friends, like gloria dump... By Jacob, 3rd grade."
3,Because of Winn-Dixie Book Review,"India Opal was a lonely, friendless girl who just moved to Naomi, Florida. Her mamma left when she was three and her daddy, the Preacher, doesn't even pay attention to her. One day Opal meets an ugly, stray dog in the Winn-Dixie grocery store who she calls Winn-Dixie. The Preacher says she can keep the dog, so Opal found her first friend. Opal and Winn-Dixie make friends with Miss Franny, the librarian, Otis, the pet store worker, and Gloria Dump, a half-blind old lady. Winn-Dixie was good at making friends, soon, everybody loved him. Opal worked at the pet store with Otis to get a collar for Winn-Dixie. She listened to Miss Franny's stories and read and talked to Gloria Dump. Now Opal is not quite so lonely. This is a great story about the friendship between a little girl, a dog and their small town."
3,Good Dog,"This story takes place in the summer, at a store nameWinn Dixi.the store is important becuse that's where the little gril foundo the dogThis book is mosly about A dog that goes inside the store.A gril name Opal finds him and decides to call him Winn Dixi.He ask's her dad if she can keep hem . And her dad said yes. Winn Dixi helps Opal make new friend's .In my opinion.I think that the storywas nice . Becuse a dog can help people get friends. and olso a dog can be your best friend .and olso its vary entertaning."
3,its ok,I think its a pretty good book. I mean it can be better you should try to read it. If your a advanced reader you should try a different book though.
5,Touching,"I thought that this book was touching because the dog, Winn Dixie, changed Opal's life by helping her make friends."
3,Because of Winn Dixie,"The book Because of Winn Dixie is by Kate DiCamillo. The character of Opal is a ten year old girl with curly red hair who moves to Florida with her preacher father. She finds a dog in a store and wants to take it home. She adopts him and has to clean him up. She names him Winn Dixie. When they go to the library, Winn Dixie frightens the librarian who thinks the dog is a bear. Opal tells her that it's her dog. The librarian lets them in and tells them about her bear encounter when she was younger. Opal goes to the pet store to buy a collar and leash but she can not afford the one that she wants. She decides to pay by working there. On the way back home she meets a blind women named Gloria and they become friends. At the end of the story Opal and her friends have a party. It rains in the middle of the party and they lose Winn Dixie. Opal goes looking to find him. Will Opal find Winn Dixie? Read this book to find out."
4,Pleased Mom in Ft. Lauderdale,The book was received in the condition described and was sent promptly. The timing was important since it was a summer reading project for school. I would order from this seller in the future.
5,My Favorite Book,"Because of Winn Dixie is a fiction book written by Kate DiCamillo. It's about a girl named India Opal Buloni. She lived with her dad. One day she goes to the grocery store named Winn Dixie and finds a dog. She calls the dog Winn Dixie.My favorite part of Because of Winn Dixie is when Opal finds Winn Dixie, the dog. I like the book because it's fiction and it's a good story. The book is for 7 to 13 year old kids."
4,Friendship of Two,"This book is about a girl (Opal) who is in a store. She sees a stray dog making a total mess. The manager said, ""Take him to the pound."" Opal said, ""No he's my dog."" The store was called Winn-Dixie.The author of this book is Kate DiCamillo. The main characters are... Opal, Dad, Gloria Dump, Amanda and Miss Franny Block. Opal's mom moved away a long time ago. Opal lives in a trailer park. Opal lived in Watley, Florida but she moved to Naomi, Florida.I think Kate is trying to say, ""Take what you have and love it."" My favorite part is when Opal meets Winn-Dixie. I think everyone can read it. This book is funny and sad. Hope you like it.by Sam"
5,Loved it,Winn Dixie and Opal have such a special relationship. We loved all the characters in the book. It was fun to read.
5,What I loved,I liked this book because it was super funny and had a few sad parts. I could not put it down like I am doing with The Tale of Despereaux.
5,Great book!,This is an amazing story about a girl and her dog. Everyone over 8 should read this book. I love it!
5,"Very, very interesting",In this book you will find a new twist on the Z Space Theory. Hint: Just keep in mind how small mosquitoes really are. If you're into aliens you'll love this book. Psychics can be a problem when you're trying to keep a secret. If you're an Animorphs fan you definately need this book.
2,.,"While I thought this was something of a filler novel, it was still fun for those who appreciate a space twist."
5,THE BEST AX BOOK EVER!,"AX finds himself making a tough decision. To leave the Animorphs OR join his people. They are in misquito morph when transported to ZERO-SPACE! Luckily, a Andalite Scout Ship finds them. Good Luck Andalites! THE BEST K.A. Applegate book ever! Read it, beloved Animorph fans!"
5,"The animorphs have a big,big problem.",I won't give any spoilers so don't be scared the.The begining was great the middle was cool and the end was fine and a little funny.This has to be a classic.It shows what Applegate can do if she puts her mind on it unlike #2 that one was stupid and.In #18 we finaaly here from Ax's point of view last time that happened was 10 months ago.So to my conclusion buy this book Ax fan or not.
4,One of the better Animorph books.,"I've been reading Animorphs for a long time now. Unfortunately,they are becoming formula fiction. The Ax and Tobias books are usually the best because K.A. Applegate can't use the formula on them. This makes them harder to write. And that is why these two characters have far fewer books than the others. Anyway,besides a few plot holes and being somewhat predictable, this is a good book. Read it."
5,I loved it!,I loved this book. The animorphs get zapped to Zero-space and Ax has to choose to stay with his people or go back to earth.
2,oh yeah baby,This is the best book i have ever read in my life. It is cool when they go into zero space and Ax trys to get a job at cinnabon
5,This was a good job well done on the new upcoming new book,"Well this book is the best so far.I have ben a big fan of animorphs since the first one came out.Every time the author writes a bok it gets more intersting every time.At school almost every body in the 5th grade reads it only the boys.This brings up a good point we actully have our own animophs club we have a code which is Ax then we hide under the table and start reading we love it.I have my own news letter and I been talking about this like crazy. Well keep up the good work, your number 1 fan,Jason Porter."
4,Cool book,"Ax is kinda corny. I think the Zero-Space rubberband was nifty. Kinda creepy, but nifty at the same time. If I ever got to morph a Leeran, I wouldn't want people reading my mind either. Not the best book, but worth reading."
4,It's *cool*...,"It's not the best in the series, but it's still good...They get sucked into Z-space and end up saving the leeran homeworld. New Morphs: A mosquito *yay*"
5,Stellar,"It's a beautiful story and even more beautiful music behind it. If at first you don't like it, listen again, you didn't hear it."
2,The movie is better,"Townshend's musical version of Ted Hughes' Iron Man (the source for the movie, The Iron Giant) is an interesting, but essentially flawed attempt at bringing the story to life. The songs do not tell the story, rather they stand as separate disparate elements. The choice of having an anonymous cast of animals serve as the chorus does not hold the listener's interest and Townshend's singing the role of Hogarth does not give you a true feel for the character. Johnny Lee Hooker as the Iron Man and Nina Simone as the wicked Space Dragon are the only stand out performances. A valiant effort, but the film better captures the essence, if not the plot, of the original book."
1,Pitful,"This album is a true labor of love. It really has no redeeming value. Even the reunited Who can't bring this rusted giant to life. The songs don't even relate to the story.If you want a better version of the story, rent The Iron Giant (produced by Pete Townshend). If you want to hear great Pete Townshend music, buy anything other that this CD.[DW]"
4,Townsend triumph,"Pete Townsend puts out a masterful product with this CD. Some great music, some great messages. ""Iron Man: A Musical"" inspired a fantastic animated movie (Iron Giant) that I thoroughly enjoyed as well. Get this CD. It's worth the listen."
4,"Orange County Virginia, Order Book One, 1734-1739, Part One, 1734-1736","WARNING! The most important part of this book's title is missing in this listing. It is: ""Part One, 1734-1736."" If you are looking for your Scots-Irish family in the Valley they probably came in '38 and '39 and this book won't help you. Too bad Ms Little didn't do the rest of the order book(s). If you want '34 and '36 this is a very good resource book with a handy dictionary of legal terms in the front."
4,Millionaire's first love,This is a cute story with a sad ending. Through the help of a lost love he finds a reason to change his life and does for the better. I love the actors. The English subtitles were well done.
2,Poor Product Support,"We purchased a Marathon car seat two years ago. The seat was recalled due to slippage in the straps, reported by approximately 100 users. Britax recalled the seats, indicating that seat owners should send information online, and they would receive additional hardware to correct the problem. We completed the online information but never received the hardware. We then attempted to inquire online but could not get the company's email address from the website. As a last resort, I called the company's headquarters in Charlotte, NC, finally finding my way through voicemail after voicemail to a recording, on which I left a voicemail. I still have not received the hardware to correct the seat we have. I will never purchase a Britax product again and am looking for a good seat for my second child now. I understand Graco is highly rated for safety and comfort and is significantly less expensive. I recommend looking for alternatives."
1,This seat is not safe for a toddler!!!!,I bought this seat and was so excited. I used it for three months and then realized that my son 27 months can reach the crotch adjuster and losen his straps just by lifting up. I called Britax and complained they agreed that this was a FLAW in the seat but there was nothing that they would or could do for me. Basically to sew up the velcro and get over it. For 249.99 and the safety of my child I would and am not getting over it. This could happen with any toddler. I do not understand why this adjuster is so close at hand and so easy to use if it was a push down then he would never be able to do this. I returned the seat to BRU (they are great) and bought an different seat. note all other brands did not have the crotch adjuster close at hand. I am disgusted with how Britax handled this!!! Beware!!!
5,Well worth the money,"My daughter is 9 months old and has been using this carseat for 3 months. She seems very comfortable in it. I purchased it because of its excellent safety ratings. Since it is rated to 65 pounds I will be using this carseat for many years- far longer than any of the other baby products I've purchased. Given the amount of use, I don't think this is too expensive.Though the instructions say that the lining is not machine washable, I threw mine in the machine on delicate and it came out just fine. It is also very easy to wipe up.My baby is facinated with the adjusting strap - it entertains her for a long, long time in the car. Apparently, it is delicious.I have flown with this carseat twice so far and it installs into an airplane very easily. To carry it through the airport, pull the should staps out so they are as loose as possible and them put your arms through. Though you'll look like a dork carrying it on your back, you'll have both hands free to deal with baby."
5,Fantastic,"This is a great car seat. Installing it was a little complicated ,so please make sure that you get your child seat check by the police. I should have purchased this car seat in the first place instead of buying an infant car seat. I found that the infant car seat was a waste of money. This should be a good investment."
5,JUST BOUGHT 2ND SEAT!!!!,"I JUST PURCHASED MY SECOND MARATHON ""RACER"". MY KIDS ARE 2 YEARS OLD AND 2 MONTHS OLD. MY DAUGHTER IS A BIG GIRL(35LBS.). SHE FITS IN HER SEAT PERFECTLY. SINCE SHE IS STILL TOO YOUNG FOR A BOOSTER, I JUST PURCHASED ANOTHER FOR MY SON. HE DOESN'T LIKE BEING SNUG IN HIS INFANT CARSEAT (PEREGO PRIMO VIAGGIO) SO I PUT HIM IN A BIG SEAT INSTEAD. HE LOVES IT. I HAVE BOTH SEATS IN MY BACK SEAT OF MY TRAILBLAZER AND STILL HAVE ROOM FOR ME TO SIT THERE WHEN NEEDED. I HAVE SPARE SEATS I BOUGHT FOR MY MOTHER AND HUSBANDS CAR BUT THEY DON'T ADD UP TO THESE GREAT CHAIRS.THEY ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND BUCKLE IN. THEY ARE BUILT LIKE A BIG BIKE HELMET. YES THEY ARE PRICEY BUT YOUR CHILDS SAFTEY IS PRICELESS!!!!"
4,Kool Pet carrier,"I have six cats. This is just great for the smaller ones (less than 15 pounds). There are plenty of areas for my babies to look and be seen, both side access and top access. The lining is comfortable for them as well. I recommend it."
1,Not very strong,"I bought this item from Amazon to use for my Bichon Frise as a car travel case, While we frequently take him with us, we used the case only a few times to contain him in a safe area. Last evening we brought the Bichon to a small gathering and I put him in the carrier so that I could eat my dinner while he was safe as well as out of the reach of the group. Within 5 minutes I watched as my 7.5 pound dog walked freely among the gathering. He had ripped the screening in one area of the case and ripped out a three cornered piece, gaining his freedom. Fortunately this was a very safe place but I cannot imagine the havoc that could have happened should this have happened anywhere else. It is too late to return the product, all packaging is gone as is the shipping information. The problem has nothing to do with Amazon, I will continue my relationship with them! But I will not purchase anything else from the manufacturer and would advise everyone else to avoid a purchase of this item."
4,carry your pet in style,"My girl loves going out with her tiny dog.Her dog enjoys the view from the carrier and they're both happy, what more can you ask for.I recommend this."
5,Great bag,I think this bag looks great and does everything I want and need it to do.It's compact. It has the top zipper and the side zipper. It has see through mesh so my cat cansee out. It has the sherpa bottom for comfort. It has the shoulder straps and padded handles.This bag is really the cats meow. I would highly recommend this bag.
4,"Good construction, concerns about fit","Our dog weighs 12 pounds; her measurements were perfect for the medium size but she couldn't stand or turn around in the carrier, which airlines require. We hired a dog sitter instead of taking her on the plane. The product is as described and appears to be well made but I wish we had ordered a larger size. No return policy is a bummer; dog was inside carrier for less than 10 seconds.UPDATE: We have now used the carrier to take our dog on 3 cross-country airplane trips. She still doesn't like going in and having the top zipped, but she seems quite comfortable once she has settled down and snuggled in. I think now that it is actually helpful that she can't move around much in the carrier and it certainly would be hard to fit a larger one under the seat in front of us. The airlines have never done more than glance at the carrier and weigh her in it to be sure we didn't exceed their limit. Changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars."
4,"Good quality, wish it were a little longer","This bag is good quality, and easy to carry. I wish it were just a little longer so I could feel like my cat could stretch out. (I have a 12 pound male cat) Otherwise it is perfect."
4,Lovely listening!,"Sarah Brightman has a beautiful voice, and this selection of songs is just made for her. I really enjoyed this CD when I first checked it out at my local library -- and then I decided to buy it new, something I don't do except when I REALLY like the CD and intend to listen it it over and over.The quality of her voice, the other performers, and the variety of Webber songs makes for an excellent combination!"
1,Still Pondering,"Have numerous Sarah B CDs, but hesitate to purchase more. Love one, hate the others as I am not bilingual. I do enjoy some songs in other languages, but not an entire CD. Got hoodwinked twice, and can't find anything in these reviews that indicate this CD is mostly in English. I don't have speakers for this old computer, so I can't take a practice run as offered. Can anyone please advise if most of this CD is in English? The songs sound wonderful, but won't purchase until I get some add'l info.Thanks."
5,Love Changes Everything,"Sarah Brightman is at her best when she sings Andrew Lloyd Webber compositions. I have loved her since her ""Phantom"" days. This CD contained previously unreleased music which was a treat."
3,"Good, but volumes not same as original","After listening to my tapes on this many times, plus seeing it live in London with original cast, was disappointed with CDs in that spoken dialog was less audible than music, so was constantly having to adjust the sound up for the quiet dialog, and then down for the booming finales of each song."
5,"Good production, but too traditional","Jules Massenet - Manon / Dessay, Villazon, Ramey, Lanza, Henry, Perez, McVicar (Gran Teatre del Liceu 2007)An excellent production from Barcelona with great singing from Dessay and Villazon. But, let's face it: ruffled collars and powdered wigs are so last year. How about setting the opera in a tent city along the American River during the Great Depression of 2009-2112? Wouldn't that be more fun? (Meanwhile I'm anxiously waiting for my Copenhagen Ring to arrive.)"
2,as if it were second rate Mascagni (imagine that),"The production works against the score. That said, I like the production, but I prefer the score. Dessay is a very fine actress, but lacks the control and finesse in the voice-- less voice, more silver. And Villazon is just a disaster! To roar out Ah, fuyez.... is to make a mockery of great French music and great French singing. He belts as if he were a Mongolian shepherd. To have heard the style from Thill or even Villazon's Spanish compatriot, Aragall on the Myto recording.. would put Villazon to shame. I am so disappointed."
1,missing item,I was very disappointed not to receive the paper dolls that were to come with the book. The one review written on this book mentioned the paper dolls which I knew my daughter would love.
5,Recommended!,"I own a Mitsubishi Montero and put these shocks on my truck. It's really impressive smoothness immediately noticeable when using the truck for the first time after the change. The trucks are usually hard car buffer, but with the Pro Comp ES3000 honestly feels like another car."
2,waiting for the sequel,"I was not that impressed with this work, I want to here about what basque really are, and was some what disappointed, being basque my self I was eager to here about my ancestor's, and how special thease rare Rh negative blood people are,there is not enough info out there about thease people!I couldn't bring myself to reading the first part, to prehistoric for me,"
2,Too short,"This DVD is only 41 minutes long, so you only get about 5 minutes with each artist, plus a 5 minute intro. Video quality is ok, but looks like transfers from VHS. I'm a beginner on the bass, but I've been playing guitar for over 10 years. If you are a beginner at music theory, the Glenn Letsch snippet will be confusing (chord theory). If you are a beginner bass player, you might pick up a couple of semi-interesting exercises and techniques.If I'd been expecting it to be only 40 minutes long, I would have given it 3 stars."
2,Not great.,"I am not too thrilled with some of the ingredients. I was hoping for no added sugar and they taste over baked, hard, and dry. They would be great with dips and soup but again I wish the ingredients were more simple. It is very hard to clean up your diet and still keep it interesting."
1,SIZE NOT AS STATED,Why can't these @#^* tarp manufactures make tarps the size it states on the package? This is NOT rocket science? I built a frame for this tarp to fit. Come to find the tarp is 6 inches shorter. COME ON...are they that hard up to skimp on 6 inches of fabric. ALWAYS look for tarps that say ACTUAL SIZE!!! These are not!UPDATE: Found company that sells FULL FINISHED SIZE TARPS! [...]
5,Ilford Classic Pearl Paper,I first found this product in a camera shop I liked it so much that I searched the internet to find a better price. I bought the paper for about half the price as tha camera shop. This paper gives a professional looking print using the HP Photosmart C5180 all-in-one printer.
4,lips that taste of tears,"Thanks to browsing and your recommendations, I found my way to this sensual, exotic, rhythmic and unique ""world"" music. Her voice is wonderful. My only minor complaint is that I would like to hear more range both of voice and material, but the groove is right on and hits the right spot."
1,Suckfest,"I heard a song off of this cd in a music shop while in London. It sounded good so I tracked it down in the States when I returned. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The production is so polished that all of the cultural nods on the individual songs sound like some mad attempt by Walt Disney to culturalize the average nincompoop. Just look at the images the ""musicians"" choose for themselves on the cover. That should tell you everything."
4,Salty yet sweet,Susheela Raman has a great voice and she and her band offer a very unique and distinctive sound. She reminds me a bit of Tanita Takaram with an Indian musical twist.
5,A pure musical pleasure,"Susheela Raman manages to sooth the mind and wake up our rythmic senses...Its a pure delight. Her smooth and yet powerful voice is hypnotic, the musicians inventive and talented. I highly recommend the purchase of this unique musical pearl."
1,Great canisters.,Great canisters. Will probably order more. Good size for holding various items like flour or sugar or cereal. or herbs.
4,Good quality costume with a few sizing issues,"We purchased this costume for a high-school stage production. The quality of the costume is much better than others in this price range and is much prettier. This has a zipper closure in the back where others have velcro. However, the bodice had to be altered (taken in) to fit a smaller person, the finger straps on the gloves were way too small, and the choker was way too large. Be careful when ironing the underskirt - use a very cool iron or it will melt. Overall, a nice costume."
2,"Oversized, Doesn't look like an authentic cinderella dress.","I was very dissappointed with this costume. First of all the standard sizing is huge! As a petite 115 pound, size 2 woman I was completley overwhelmed in this costume and it looks frumpy on me. It doesn't look like a very ""authentic"" cinderella costume at all in person. The puffy things on the hips fall too low (I am 5'4) and the whole dress needs to be altered professionally to fit me approporiatly. The ONLY positive thing I have to say about this dress is that the underskirt is thick and provides a nice volume to the dress. Keep in mind that this dress is ANKLE LENGTH, not a long dress that comes to the ground.Also, i believe it said that it comes with the gloves but I never receieved the gloves, only the headband and the chocker necklace with the dress."
5,You call it an herbal supplement. I call it magic,"I love St. John's Wort. Somebody turned me onto it at a time when stress threatened to turn me into a ""wart"" of a different sort. I discovered that taking the extract instead of pills allowed me to adjust the dose a bit, since I'm pretty sensitive to most medications. I learned that half a dropper in the morning, before coffee, would have me bright-eyed and bushy-tailed without being bug-eyed and ""speedy"". I learned that taking it after dinner was a bad idea -- kept me awake -- but that's why God created Ginkgo. I learned how to use this wonderful stuff to help keep me ""sunny-side-up"".I also learned that some extracts are muddy and sludgy and taste AWFUL. I don't absolutely require magic to taste great, but why be masochistic?This stuff is lovely. No sludge or grit, taste isn't too bad, even if coffee isn't around for a chaser, and works wonders. Thanks, Amazon!"
3,Poor layout diminishes cookbook,"I have found that this cookbook drives me nuts. Many of the recipes call for sauces or spices or marinades that are included in the end of the book. This means I need to flip pages. On top of that, some of the condiments/sauces require additional construction.Here is an example:On page 143, Adaso Jugoso, sounds good. Seems simple. But I have to go to page 209 for instructions on Adobo para Asado. On page 209, Adobo para Asado calls for three additional ingredients from other pages: Mostza (page 208), Pasta de Albahaca (page 204-205), Vinagre Aromatico (page 202).My problem is that since I do not stock all these items, I have to first construct them (timing unknown) and then construct the main recipe.I would have preferred the recipes to involve less flipping back and forth through the book."
3,Not a beginer to intermediate reference guide.,"As usual, this is an excellent book by John Armstrong. While a part of this book is educative, converting these plans from their blueprint stage into working layouts is for well experienced modelers. The trend has been shifting from permanent layouts to small & midsized modular ones which can be taken down in parts & moved to another location. If you are in the beginning or the intermediate stage of model railroading this book is not recommended."
4,"Cyndi Thompson - ""What I Really Meant To Say""","This gal has an incredably sexy voice and her title cut is exceptional. However, I found some of the tracks a bit too cute and strayed a bit too far from country. The CD grows on you as you listen to it."
1,She might as well humm...,"When I first heard this song on the radio I thought it had good lyrics and great music, but her voice left a lot to be desired. It sounds like she mumbled her way through the recording session. I immediately X'ed her off my ""favorte singers"" list.I had these feelings toward her until her second single came out, ""I Always Liked That Best"". I don't know where the transformation came from! I could actually understand the words!!!My advice to you is, if you like Cyndi Thompson, fork over the extra cash to buy the entire CD. Buying this single is a waste of your money."
5,Totally Awesome!!!,"I recently bought this single and let me say I LOVE it so much!!! This single has made me a huge fan of Cyndi's. Cyndi Thomson has a beautiful voice and also writes as well as sings her songs. This single is enhanced, and when you put it in your computer there's all kinds of cool stuff to do, including watch her debut music video, listen to the CD, and also watch a video bio. So if you like her debut song, ""What I Really Meant To Say"", buy this CD!!! You will not regret it!!!"
5,Bring on the whole CD!,"Cyndi Thomson has one of the most distinctive and beautiful voices to come out fo Nashville in a long time. The first time I heard this song, I knew I needed the album! While I'm settling for the single now, it's a promising hint of what's to come. The instrumentation on the song is gorgeous, and the feeling Cyndi puts into singing this song is a far cry from the fake manufactured pop/rock/country we hear on the radio. Let's hope she does well!"

2,VARIOUS THEORIES OF HOMOSEXUALITY,"Edward Stein, editorForms of Desire:Sexual Orientation and the Social Constructivist Controversy(New York: Garland, 1990) 365 pagesEleven authors attempt to understand the origins of homosexuality,some tending toward nature, others toward nurture.These articles have all appeared elsewhere earlier.The authors tend to depend on library researchrather than original thinking or new scientific research.The book is disappointing, but it is part of the on-going discussionamong advocates of various positions.The sex-script hypothesis would have been helpful,but it is not represented.If you would like to read better books,search the Internet for this bibliography:""Best Books on Sexual Orientation"".James Leonard Park, author ofImprinted Sexual Fantasies: A New Key for Sexology."
2,Theresa,"The money clip does not hold more than 5 bills. The space given to put the bills is very small. If you put it between the NY and not all the way back in the space given, the bills will fall out. I have been calling and left 3 messages to the seller, but no return call. I have also waited an hour for online chat. They kept saying someone will be with you shortly. YEAH RIGHT!!UPDATE!! I contacted Amazon about the poor customer service. They wereGREAT! They refunded my money and contacted the seller directly. Thanks AMAZON!!! I love this website!!"
3,"Good music, but","Bought for my 95 year old Polish mother in law. She wanted some Polish polkas. The music was good, but she said it wasn't authentic. Said it was bland and ""watered down"". Not what she was looking for I think it's similar to when they take rock and roll songs and make them into ""soft rock"". There wasn't enough accordion use and it just didn't have that 'zing' to it. His music is good, just not what we were looking for."
4,Small but interesting,"I had heard about this ""book"" from a friend who has read it so much he knows it by heart. Since I have lived in Alaska for nearly 30 years I wanted to have a copy to read for myself. So I ordered it when I found it on Amazon.com. It isn't a book really, it is more of a pamphlet. But it is a fascinating story and one I will keep to share with my family."
3,Collector's Item,"If you're a student of Folklore, expecially the ""wildman"" tradition, this little book is a must. It doesn't look like much, softcover and small looking, but there's a lot between the covers, enough to keep you musing for the remainder of your days. Hang onto it, it may be one of those tales on the edge of being lost forever."
5,Kill the bunnies!,"This is a game we never tire of playing, but love that we get to add expansions to change things up! Get all the expansions! They are worth it- this game is fantastic!"
5,Awesome Game,"I love this game. I own the Starter Deck (blue), green, orange, yellow, red, purple, pink, khaki, and steel. I am contemplating the Onyx and White. This game is awesome, hands down. I just wish I had more friends who wanted to play!"
1,1040: christianity in the New Asia,"Christianity is poison. It's a soul destroying evil. Jesus said: ""The kingdom of heaven is not of this world."" And Revelation stated:""Licifier shall deceive and dominate the world."" This is christianity: THE GREAT DECEIVER. KILL THIS SATAN DEFORE IT DESTROY ASIA. IT'S A KALYUG-BORN 'RELIGION' - BORN TO DECEIVE."
3,Ersatz Bruce Again,"I own several of the ""Bruce Li"" films starring Ho Chung Tao as a poor substitute for Bruce Lee. The three best ones also star sexy Dana (born Hsam Hsak Yi in 1951). This time she has competition from Lin Yang Yang who is sexy too and has a better figure. These girls and others are nude several times. That is much more interesting than the uninspired fight scenes. The best ones are against apes. At least they are mildly amusing. Yang Tze (Bolo Yeung) and Lo Leih are familiar faces to fans of Hong Kong movies. They are villains as one may expect. Dana is Princess Ankawa who saves Bruce when he is poisoned. He must leave but constantly dreams of Ankawa. He returns to be with his lover and their son."
3,Not true to size,"Maybe I'm mistaken by the sizes of flip flops, but these are huge on my feet. Either these run very big or you are supposed to buy them in a full size smaller..."
5,My son's favorite show.,"My son is in LOVE with this show. He'll be 2 soon. He started watching this less than a month ago. He asks to watch it Every. Single. Day. All 3 videos are on Netflix.FYI - - I hate this show. The music is so obnoxious- I'm not even that picky. Every adult I know that's seen this thinks the same. If you don't let your kids watch or play with certain things for the sake of your sanity, you're going to want to skip these. The songs stick in your head so you will be singing them in your sleep and the characters are nauseating. I didn't review based on adult appeal though."
4,Puppy bus,"Our son calls this ""puppy bus."" He's now 22 months old and is a big fan of these DVDs, though his interest has waned a bit. Similar to the first movie (we have opted not to get the second one, thus far). Highly recommend this as a way to keep your toddler busy for a half hour, but, as I said, he seems now to not be able to stay interested in this one as much, probably because he's seen it dozens of times.PS: He loves the part toward the end with the little boy dressed as an elf playing the violin. Makes him smile and go ""ha ha"" every time, which in turn does the same for us."
4,Great Book For Beginners,"This book was real helpful. I really didn't know much about the topics so I found it a good introduction. If you are even semi-knowledgeable about this area, I would recommend another book."
4,Excellent broad strokes coverage,"Overall, an excellent resource for security. It's small size means that that topics are narrow enough to be digested and acted upon individually."
3,Shadow of Babylon,This was a fairly good primer on the subject. I believe it was well intentioned and useful to get people thinking outside the box of dogma.
1,In The Shadow of Babylon is a shadow itself,"It was very hard to follow, and not put together very well. It does have some good history points, but its just not seamlessly put together"
1,Unfounded Theories and Misquoted Scripture - Caution,"I find it hard to follow someone who attempts to teach from a source that they cannot simply quote from in a proper way, using citations. Further, using THEORY as the foundation of an argument is never wise. And it is even less wise to follow THEORY as truth. This man is a fear monger and becomes the thing he speaks against, by his own actions. And by casting stones the wall of truth is buried just a little more. Thanks for that."
1,conspire to ridicule america,This is conspiracy theory trash. It is anti-american and anti-constitution. If Christians really don't believe in freedom of religion they should go elsewhere.
1,This book was not very informative,"The book served to merely list what one needed to know for the AP exam, but it did not write out in detail what one needed to know. Also, the practice tests were not as useful."
2,Short and nonspecific,"If you are looking for a book that will help you review for the AP European History test, this is not your book. It only goes as far to give you a timeline and a list of important people for each chapter. It does have some pratice tests, but overall, it was a bad review choice."
3,"BAD for review, good for test-taking tips...",Do not buy this book expecting a lengthy review of the subject as did I. It only goes as far as to give a cursory timeline of each time period and a list of UNDEFINED names and events for each.I did up my rating to a 3 only because the book does have some excellent example essays and DBQ's as well as tips on how to score the max on each. The two practice tests are relevant to the AP test and each answer is explained in detail at the end--but THAT is as far as the review goes.
1,This book does not give an in-depth description of anything,I strongly recommend that you look for a different review book for the European History exam. This book does not give an in depth description of anything. The only thing that this book is good for is helping you with your Free Response Essays.
3,Beware of item description,"Be aware that this is not to be used to measure fuel pressure on fuel injected vehicles. Also, the description says it can be used to allow one person to bleed brakes (???). Someone really goofed when they wrote that. They must be thinking of a vacuum pump such as those made by Mitivac."
3,Oversimplified,"This book came up repeatedly under various search engines for ""leadership."" I would say it is probably a far more valuable resource for private-sector business folks. The book misses the mark on ""leadership"" analysis, but could probably be a McDonald's drive-thru success for the business world. I am not a student of business, but it appeared to wildly over-simplify a complex topic. I noted the author's doomsday-ish tone, particularly in sentences such as: ""The choice is clear; Reengineer and flourish, or fail to reengineer and perish."" The book was not one of the resources in the ""leadership"" arena that appealed to me."
3,Wearable,"The sweatshirt is on the thin side. Also, the tee-shirt is too large while the sweatshirt is too small for my taste. Otherwise, both are good athletic wear and nothing more. Go Illinois!"
2,below average word list,"I used this workbook level C for both my average in spelling 4th grader and above average in spelling 3rd grader. The children commented many times about how simple the words were. In fact they were much to simple! This would be a good workbook if you are looking to give your child ""busy work"". However, unless your child is really having a hard time with spelling you don't want this! The word list are below grade level! It was a waste of time and money. Even on the last lesson list words are much to simple. They are words like hear, your, to, our, great...etc"
2,Don't buy from New Chapter Recycling,"The workbook is good--4 stars--but I bought this used via New Chapter Recycling (one of the Amazon-approved vendors listed for this product) and they had listed it as ""Like New."" However, this used book was MISSING (torn out) 51 (of 192) pages, and another 5 had been written in/completed by a prior child, for a grand total of 56 of the 192 pages (29% of the book)!!! How they could claim it was ""Like New"" is beyond me, and I'll be sure NOT to buy from NEW CHAPTER RECYCLING again! (I don't know how to leave negative feedback at their storefront, but wanted to warn others, so had to do so here.)Otherwise, the book itself was fun for my 3rd grader--short stories with spelling lists included so that she gets spelling, vocab, and reading comprehension all in one text! It may not be a sole curriculum, but you could use it as a supplement when your child gets bored with straight spelling list memorization."
1,waste of money,"Ladies.beleive me it is waste of money..poor quality powder which dries your skin and there is no signs of shimmer either. I cannot beleive how I did such a mistake, shame on me and mostly on Laura Mercier."
4,Pretty,"Good product! I got it for halloween and like the other reviewer said, you'll probably need something to hold it up because it'll slip down otherwise afterawhile. Other than that, I really liked it and find it to be a good product."
2,Unconfortable,"Because it doesn't have the silicon on the end to hold it up on the tie, slides down.Besides that, it has a pretty patern."
4,Pretty awesome,"So I just got these in the mail and pulled them on right away. I have to say I have some thighs on my and I was afraid that they wouldn't fit being one size fits all although I'm usually good with knee highs and tights but you never know. However they fit great, they have a good stretch to them which is nice although the top tends to roll down a bit but a garter belt should help with that ""problem"". Just an an FYI there is a seam in the back of the thigh highs, which I love but other may not. The shipping was also great and purecostume gave me a coupon too (I'm not saying they always do or have to but hey it was a nice treat) Also shipping was superfast!"
4,pretty but a little too long for a shortie like me,I love these but they are a little too long on my thigh. I can make them work though. It's not worth returning them. If you are short you should go with [...] and won't go wrong.
5,A personal favorite.,"I've always loved the more literary espionage novels, like those written by John Le Carre or Graham Greene; but for more purely escapist reading, I've enjoyed few books as much as Adam Hall's Quiller novels. Of these, ""The Peking Target,"" remains a personal favorite (esp. since I was studying karate when I first read it). Few authors do as good a job of entering into, and involving the reader in the borderline insanity of an action hero's mind. Even fewer did a comparable job of describing a hand-to-hand fight scene from that same perspective (Quiller never used a gun, and both the author and character were long-time karateka). Adam Hall's Quiller books were really great fun and I'd love to see them back in print some day. If you like straight ahead action with a degree of psychological depth, try a Quiller novel (if you can find one) try it (and remember to tell me where you got it)."
1,Killed our 1 year old rabbit,I bought this cage for my 1 year old rabbit....He got his teeth caught in between the plastic and the metal where the cage snaps together...He lost one of his teeth and the bled all over the place and died of shock in my arms (most of which my 3 yr old witnessed)....I must warn against buying these types of snap together cages...This has been a horrible experience for me and my family...And I want to be sure another sweet bunny does not meet the same fate as our baby did.
4,Transitional,"Presto is an album that marked a change in Rush's sound from the keyboard-rich releases (Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire) to a harder-edged sound that fans were yearning for. This album sort of meets half way; it has robust guitars, but still retains an early to mid-eighties feel. Rush went about this album in hybrid fashion, which appeals to the fans of their 80's stuff as well as fans of their 70's material. Besides SHOW DON'T TELL, many people like the title track as well as THE PASS. Neil's lyrics have never been better than on this album, but the music isn't even close to their best. Still, this was an important release that closed the 80's and transitioned them into a harder sound for the 90's and beyond. This album also features some great acoustic guitar."
3,Rush - One Of The Band's Lesser Studio Releases,"""Presto"" has never been one of my favorite Rush albums. Not that it is bad, but much of the material here, just seems mediocre in light of the band's past achievements. I'll start out with my favorite track ""Presto"" which is acoustic based and the longest song on the album at close to 6 minutes. This is prime 80's era Rush and a great little song. Other tracks that I like include ""Red Tide"", ""Superconductor"", and ""Available Light"". In fact I really like the 2nd half of this album quite a bit better than the first half. The single ""Show Don't Tell"" is probably one of my least favorite of all Rush singles. The album is not one that Rush fans tend to gravitate to, and most of this material was dropped from the band's live set years ago (although ""The Pass"" was resurrected on the band's last outing. If you are a fan ""Presto"" is worth owning, but this would be way down my list of recommended albums for starters."
3,tale of a rush fan,"i think im starting to get it?here is my tale of a rush fan(me):when rush came out i loved them!they were everything i wanted in a band.i loved the music instantly ,with no effort or repeated listens..they matured faster than i did and needed to grow and expand,everything i needed and respected them for eventually drove me away for a while..after signals i started to lose intrest ,gone were the in your face guitars and rock anthems..but now i am finally maturing i feel this album deserves rediscovering.so with my headphones on and presto playing i write this review and i think i am starting to get it!some of my favorite tracks are:show dont tell,superconductor,hand over fist,available light,red tide,overall the cd as a whole is good.so crank it up and enjoy."
5,Rush's most underrated album,"After Moving Pictures, I lost interest in Rush's music. They began to shed their progressive style for a more simplified sound. I still bought their albums, but I was disappointed with every one of them. Presto, however, was different. A lot of Rush fans give it a hard time, and I can understand why: the band's sounds is pretty different. but I like it. While Superconducter is overrated, the rest of the album doesn't get enough credit. This is one of my favorites, up there with 2112 and Moving Pictures."
2,Overrated,"Rush's inevitable slide into mediocrity was evident from 1982 on. Unlike Hold Your Fire, ad Power Windows this album is not drawn out in synthesizers. Alex Lifeson's guitar is not buried deep in the mix like it had been for a while, but this album is not an improvement. Neil Peart's lyrics are repetitive, as well as Geddy Lee's vocals. Gone is the shrieking, and instead his voice is low (at least for his range) and it sounds generic. The songs on this album aren't that memorable, for pretty much, if you have heard one song you've heard the whole album. The musicianship of the band is still tight, and their skills are still virtuosic, especially on the complex time signature changes on ""Chain Lightning"" and ""Superconductor,"" but even that cannot save this album from blandness. Don't be fooled by the title; Presto is not a magical experience."
4,Re-Master me!,"I have been a Rush fan since '82, and I can say without a doubt that this is the worst sounding release in their career. It is a damn shame because it is a superb CD. Presto crys out to bere-mastered. Atlantic needs to get on this because the first 2 releases on their label sound like crap. Roll the Bones and Presto have no bottom end. The sound is so tinty it hurts the ears."
3,They dropped those balls from Hold Your Fire with Presto,"When Presto came out almost 10 years ago, I couldn't wait to cue up the CD as I had been anxiously awaiting the band's release following their last studio album ""Hold Your Fire"" which I loved. However, as bright and triumphant as Alex's solo on ""War Paint"" was, and as delicious the wit and humor of ""Anagram (for Mongo)""~(remember in Blazing Saddles, ""Candygram for Mongo""?-ya gotta love Rush's sense of humor) there were at least a couple of tracks that left me cold. ""Scars,"" ""Red Tide,"" even the title track I found unmemorable, to say the least. But I loved the spit in Madonna's face with ""Superconductor"" (just listen to the break) right at the height of Blonde Ambition. Overall, though, I think most Rush fans would agree that this isn't the Power Trio's finest."
5,No other Rush album like it,"There isn't much I can add to what's already been said. This was my first Rush studio album, but I had expectations of what it would sound like, having been aware of the band for 10 years at that point. when I first listened to it, I was awestruck. It doesn't have the ""in your face"" sound of hard rock-- rather, it sounds like they're playing from very far away (this was also when Geddy's voice dropped, so..)Still, though, the production is so affecting, and the music more adventrous than any done before or since by the boys. With most Rush albums, you can sense a logical progression from album to album.But this transitional album stands alone among all rock albums as a masterpiece, and a backhand slap to anyone who thinks ""Tom Sawyer"" is all they ever did."
2,The Decline Starts Here,""" Hold Your Fire"" culminated the 80's Rush, building on the innovations brought forth on "" Power Windows"". I anxiously awaited this; the start of a new decade, with a new label and a different producer from the last two records. What a dissappointment."
3,Poorly Remastered,"This so-called ""re-mastered"" cd sounds exactly the same as my original cd; the remasters of Rush's earlier material were obvious improvements over their predecessors. I'm really disappointed in this cd. Musically, however, this is a great album from Rush's more mellow 80's period."
3,Better,"This is the first one that I could listen to after ""Signals."" Still not on the same level as their finest work, but a marked improvement over the previous three records."
3,A statement of mediocrity,"This album marked Rush's turn from performing high-technical soundscapes to playing more accessible, straightahead rock songs. Although I appreciate their ""new"" direction, I think Rush have lost their musical edge with this album. This is a safe mainstream rock affair with some good songs but also a fair amount of filler tracks. I prefer the following album ""Roll the Bones"", which provides a similar sound, but the melodies are brighter, the rhythms are funkier and the songs are more diverse."
5,Rush to the stores!!,"First off, the cover is your first hint that this album is excellent, with its jumping rabbits and mystique. What I like about this album is its use of catchy tunes found in every song,a familiar Rush trait, but many artists have 1 or 2 duds on thier Cd's. I have listened to every single Rush CD ever made, and their is not 1 song that is bad. Go out and buy this album, and while your at it, get every album theyve ever made and you'll thank yourself later.Keep up the good work Rush, and I did enjoy Vapor Trails. If you get this album, you must listen to the Pass, as it is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard."
5,These Bunny's are lovely,"the cover shows all the meaning of music on here - These bunny's (rabbits,whatever) are sweet and lovely.there are many of them on hte cover.but something wrong is with them...they are all grey and their eyes are sad...""Presto"" is catchy (""chain lightning""),cheerfull (""Anagram""),Sarcastic (""Superconductor""),Melancholic (""the pass""),funky (""hand over fist""),dark (""show don't tell"")each song is different and it makes this album so colourful and deep.it is not as energetic as ""Hold your fire"" or ""Roll the bones"" but surely worth owning.These three guys mede it great!"
5,Presto is a home run,"I picked up this album in 1989 when I was 21. It shook me to the core and had me hooked to RUSH for the rest of my life. All of the songs pick into my soul and I listen to it in some form or another every day. I esp love Superconductor, Anagram (for Mongo) [Candygram for Mongo] and Presto!Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed and maybe you'll become a RUSH for life too."
5,My personal pick for best Rush album,"After the quartet of albums that featured heavy emphasis on synths during the 80's, Rush finally seemed to rediscover the balance of synths and guitar that they did on Moving Pictures. The synth work on here is very good, but they are simply a way to add atmosphere to the song, instead of being a main element. Alex's guitar finally starts to return here, which is a good thing. The lyrics are some of the best Peart has written, especially on songs like The Pass, which is about suicide, and my personal favorite, Anagram (For Mongo). This is also much more groove to the songs than in the past, mostly evident in the songs Scars and Superconductor."
4,The more things change.....,"Purists will not embrace this effort simply because it has more sophistication than previous works. If you don't like this album upon first listen, listen again and again until you know the tunes. This one is a sleeper. Recommended tracks for AOR AIrplay: Chain Lightning, The Pass, Superconductor, Show Don't Tell... No bad tracks, but War Paint could have been developed a little more or put towards the end of the album as is.. Presto ain't my favorite Rush, but I do Love it!"
3,"Okay, but...","This is a weakest of the Rush remasters, IMHO. The sound is somewhat smoother and the bass is slightly improved, but the original ""wall of sound"" is still there.If you are a Rush completionist or have a audiophile stereo, get it. If not, I think you can live with the old release."
4,A Worthy Effort,"The musicianship on Presto is as good as any Rush album you will find. Not outstanding from start to finish, but it's worth the price just to get The Pass, Scars, and Presto. There is essential Rush material on Presto that should not be missed."
4,Great Progressive Album,"Rush is typically characterized as being a progressive rock band. I believe this is true, although is most descriptive of their 80's music (Signals, Power Windows, Presto, etc.). This is not my favorite Rush album, but it certainly ranks up there as one of the best, if not their best PROGRESSIVE sound---great integration of keyboards and guitar, crisp bass, as well as timing changes make this a very unique album. A must of have for anyone into progressive rock."
2,I Don't think so...,"Anyone who puts Presto among Rush's greatest albums is obviously not a Rush fan. This CD just plain stinks. Show don't tell is the only good song on the album. I can't believe that this is the same band that made Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings, Signals, Permanent Waves, and 2112. Avoid this and Roll the Bones like the plague, they are pure garbage."
2,Not there Best by far.....,"Mediocre at best, I liked ""Hold Your Fire"" better than this CD.""Show and Tell"" is boring and I really didnt care for this CD, nothing stuck out and grabbed me like there other CDs have..... There next effort ""Counterparts"" was much better. wouldnt recommend...."
1,Boring,"Boring, as someone else said, Presto is ""slobbery"". the only song that's cool is Show don't tell. The others are forgettable and fillers. I mean, listen to them trying to emulate ""zen"" moods in some of the songs! Horrible! It good to know that after this one came the exciting Roll the Bones.Masterpiece? Only for fanatics..."
1,Lack of critical sense,"It' not because you like the guys a lot that you have to applause everything they do. Show don't tell is very cool, but the other songs here are SOOOOO boring!Open your ears and listen to the good records this good group has recorded instead of the slobbering Presto!"
5,Rush- A band for the ages,"I have been a huge Rush fan for many years now, and i cannot state enough how intelligent, classy, and excellent the music is.Neil Peart is an excellent songwriter, and he has a knack for creating songs that actually have a meaning, instead of deviating to the beer swilling, or gang banging music of nowadays. The music is comprehensible, giving you a feeling that you can relate to the words.Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson combine to create an excellent sound to go along with the lyrics.The key word for this rock group is EXCELLENT, period."
5,There just isn't music made like this anymore,"There is so much texture and complexity on this Rush album, it's hard to find a place to start. In my opinion, the band has given up since this album. Not that post-Presto Rush albums are bad, they just do not have the masterful song writing and lyrics that Presto has. There are 3 stand-out tracks, ""The Pass"" is one of the best Rush songs of all time. ""Available light"" is the sleeper on the album, a pure gem buried as the as the track on the album (ala ""Between the Wheels"") and ""Hand Over Fist"" a powerful, well crafted song. I didn't even mention Show don't tell, which has one of the most amazing bass lines of any Rush song. A true classic."
2,Remastered version is not essential,"**Note that this refers to the 2004 remaster of Presto, and not the original 1989 album.Presto is one of my favorite Rush albums and easily gets a five-star rating from me. And while the album's sound is quite tinny and flat, no amount of remastering is going to fix that.The sound quality on the remastered CD is better and clearer, I guess, but not much. Soon after I bought this, in fact, I mixed up the original CD and the remaster and could not tell which was which (the CD itself, artwork and packaging are exactly the same as in the original, with no mention of the remastering). I had to figure out the remaster from the original just by listening to the sound quality, and it was not easy to tell the two apart.I think I was eventually successful, but the fact that I couldn't really tell which version was which speaks volumes about how essential this is."
5,Central Theme,"I notice a central theme running through this thread. I, like other post, did not like this album when I first bought it (yes, I bought the album when it came out. I now have the cd).However, I downloaded my Rush music to my iPhone and decided to listen to all of it and noticed Presto was missing. Before I listened to it I read Presto reviews and couldn't believe the overwhelming excitement over this compilation, that is until I gave it a listen.I don't know what I was thinking when Presto first came out but I LOVE this cd! The thing is, I must have listened to it an awful lot because I remember all the songs. The whole is grand. Available Light is my favorite tune on this cd."
2,Don't Buy! No Difference from 1984 Recording!,"I just wasted $9 on the so-called remastered version download of Presto. I love Presto and am a very picky musician, so I know what I am talking about.The remasters of the oldest of the catalog are definitely worth it. For example, I purchased 2112, Exit Stage Left, Hemispheres, Hold Your Fire and Signals and Vapor Trails. All were worthy of repurchase. The two ""Presto"" cuts that are on the 2009 Retrospective CD sound great and are what this ""re-Issue"" should sound like! Presto reissue is not worth it!"
3,"I feel really bad about this, but...","I cannot recommend this cd, because everything except for ""The Pass"" just doesn't sound very good. I really liked this the first few listens, but then I just thought the choruses and stuff were annoying. I think that only a few people can really stand the repeat listens of this album, and though Presto is initially really good, Roll the Bones is way better. The mastering and sparkly quality of the album detracts from its listenability. If you want something better, get Roll the Bones, one of their best and most ""popular"" type cds."
4,Revlon Dryer--Very nice!,"The only reason I gave this a four was because it is a little heavy. Get this hair dryer if you want one for home, not for travelling. Hotels have hair dryers anyways! I love it. It's powerful and the retractable cord is very nice!"
4,Worked great.,"It definately looked like a costume, but it worked great. Very flashy and very appropriate for our murder mystery party."
4,Great book so far,"I have gained a renewed interest in political science. In the trying times of not just our country but our world, I think everyone could use a refresher on how our government works. This book explains not just our system of government but how we adopted our system of government. It uses examples and cases studies to depict how american government has become what it is. Very imformative, can be dry in some spots. This is one of those books that you read over a period of time and it gives you a basic understanding of our political system."
3,Just not big enough,"I like this waffle maker, but I would just like it to be closer to the size of a dinner plate as opposed to a large hamburger."
3,Not completely satisfied...but I got what I bought,"This waffle iron was smaller than I expected, it's about 6 1/2 inches wide, and it makes very thin waffles. Also, you have to be very savvy with cast iron and know how to season it well to use this product. My husband hates it because his waffles alway stick, but I haven't given up hope yet... it will be very handy to have around just as soon as I can get it well seasoned. I still like it, but it's not quite what I expected for the money."
3,This will be with me for a while....,"I like that this item is compact and literally indestructible.* I can store this item with other pans on my hanging rack where it takes up virtually no space.* There are no cords or feet sticking out to get in the way or take up cupboard space.* There's no icky teflon to peel or crack.* I can take it camping* It will work forever.It makes fine waffles as well, I like using lots of butter or oil to get that nice crispy outside. I don't make them that often, so I'm okay with that.Here's the downside. I use a large gas burner, so it gets hot, which can make manipulating the waffle iron a little dicey sometimes. I need to make sure I've had some coffee before firing this up in the morning. If I made waffles frequently I'd probably get a electric model where I didn't have to think at all."
2,Chinese waffle iron a huge mess,"I was rather disappointed in this waffle iron. First, it's alot smaller than anticipated. If you make the recipe that comes with the iron, you'll be spending half your day making waffles.Second, it's Chinese so forget about thinking of it as a high quality waffle iron. (And it's over-priced - these probably cost 50 cents by the time they're unloaded from the container ship.Last, even after seasoning it, the waffles stuck like mad. It was a huge disappointment all the way around."
2,Nothing special,"I bought this, thinking that it would be just right for my hubby, but, the material it is made from its very low quality. Also, The sunglasses do not stay on"
1,Not For Learning To Read Notes!!,"This book is best for preschoolers; the entire system simply color codes the keys and has the child match the first a color on the page to the color of the key to play a little song, and later numbers the keys and the kids play by matching numbers. Unfortunately, it does nothing to teach them to even see what real music looks like, and its title is very misleading because it does nothing to lay the foundation for learning to read notes, which most kids are ready to do by age 6 or 7 (same as reading books). Also be aware that this is self published by the author; it is simply a spiral bound book of pages with some stickers. [...]"
1,Not for anyone wanting to LEARN piano,"I do not recommend this book. It is a spiral bound book of photocopies and includes a page of number stickers. The ""songs"" in the book consist of numbers that only allow one to play the basic melody of a song. The book has nothing that would teach one to read music, play a rhythm, or know the piano notes. I purchased this for my daughter and immediately returned it. From someone who can play the piano and read music, I was hugely disappointed as I want my kids to actually learn the piano not just to play a song or two."
2,Description Wrong,"The description says it is Silver,and the picture shows an Silver/Black (gloss) bumper.When yopu open the package it is an flat gray.Right bumper for the vehicle,wrong descriptionI posted the actual picture of the bumper and how it looks.[...]"
5,A Great Game!,"I bought all of the versions for this game separately, over the years I lost them, so I got this coming in the mail. GET THIS GAME!!! You'll love it! It has excellent graphics and awesome music. The simulation level is even more realistic! The scenarios are nice and challenging, yet fun and entertaining! This game kept me busy for a few good years now. It will do you the same good! Buy this game. Treat yourself some fun!"
4,"Great game, don't buy if on Windows 7","Amazingly addicting game, there's no doubt about that. An absolute classic that has stood the test of time. Well, at least game play has. Do not purchase this game if you are running Windows 7, it simply will not work. It's disappointing that they have not re-released a much newer version within the last year or two, I'm sure it would be cheap considering minimal re-programming would be required. But I digress... The game is great, and if you're OS is lower than Windows 7, you should be in good shape!"
4,Fun if you played this before.,"I used to always play it and forgot all about it, I always enjoyed playing this game, its pretty much like running a park as you would in real life, in every way!"
5,A great pastime,"RCT has made a lot of memories for my friend and me. The gameplay is great and makes you want to play more and more. And with the expansions (Loopy Landscapes and Corksrew Follies), it makes the game even more fun, adding new and exciting pre-built rides and new park landscapes for you to build on. Building your own coasters (and other rides) is amazing on here. But a drawback is that usually if you think a ride is totally awesome and ANYONE would want to ride it, the guests at the park usually think it's too intense or nauseating. But, there are always pre-built rides that they love if you can't seem to build a non-intense coaster. I urge you to buy this game, as it will probably run on any computer possible."
1,Not for me,"I was first wondering about this when I saw a commercial for this. But, after going to our mall, we found out that it was just a bundled pack of all three games. I decided not to get it. Take my advice; if you want to get started in Roller Coaster Tycoon, then by all means get it. But if you already own the both expansion packs(which I do), DON""T GET IT!"
1,do NOT get!!,Get the Roller Caster Tycoon 2 because even this might sound good but I have got all three games include in this and they not by far as good campared to Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 combined.Don't spend your money on this were you can get the fully updated version for more options to work with!...It's your chose either the cheap past version or the moderate updated version!?
3,Did not play in Windows 7,"My wife used to play this game about 8 years ago. We got it again to play with our 4 and 7 yo daughters. When installed on a fresh version nf Windows 7, it gave us jerky mouse movement with a lot of lag. I searched the internet but have not been able to find a fix. It was unplayable which is too bad because we knew it would be great for our girls."
5,"Got them all, if you don't get this one!!","I love this game. Have bought other simulation games, roller coasters, theme parks, but this is by far the best of all of them. I can't wait unitl the new RCT 2 comes out in October. I may be over 40, but this is almost as much fun as being at a park (without getting sick on the rides), and I feel like a kid again."
3,Well,"I bought this game at the request of my husband. I haven't played it, but he and my son seemed to enjoy it for a while. Of course, it's been a while since they played it. My son's computer died and my husband has been too busy at work. Still, I think they liked it."
3,Hard to read,"The first edition as well as the older editions have much better image quality. The words and images in the reprint (new editions) are difficult to read/see due to the reprinting process.The information, nevertheless, is extremely valuable for artists engaging in pictorial composition. Truly one of the best books on composition, and an important reference on your bookshelf."
2,DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME BETTER YET YOUR MONEY,"This book is very intimidating to read. The type looks terrible and it is bad on your eyes.It looks like a bunch of mumbo jumbo. You will totally fall in a dead sleep trying to study this or else think thoughts in your head. The Davis Drug guide is awesome so I thought a Davis review would be he bomb also, NOT! The best Nclex books so far and I have 7 of them is the Saunders (excellent guide and money back gu) and the Lipponcott (above average) so try those first before looking elsewhere...."
1,BAD BUSINESS,I ORDERED THIS ITEM 4 MONTHS AGO AND HAVE STILL NOT RECIEVED IT. I THINK IT IS VERY BAD BUSINESS TO ADVERTISE THINGS FOR SALE WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE THEM IN STOCK. I WILL CHECK OTHER AVENUES FOR THIS PRODUCT.DISAPPOINTED
1,I ordered case for nuvi 265WT and does not fit in this small case. Not worth a single penny.,"NOT WORTH IT, too small size for my GPSIncorrect information on ordering form. I did purchase GPS cover specific for NUVI 265WT and this gps does not fit, about 40% stick outside case."
1,Doesn't fit with co-advertised product!,I bought this for my Nuvi 770 because it states that it is for Garmin Personal Assistants but this product does not fit all Garmin Nuvi! Thank you Amazon for making me pay to return something that was your fault!
2,Did not fit the Nuvi 260W. Item returned.,"Looked good, but just didn't fit. (Too short for the Nuvi 260W.) Retrun process was very easy. Thank you Amazon!"
3,"Fits 3.5"" nuvi models only","Garmin accessories are as specific as the Garmin models. I purchased this with a bicycle mount, but both of them only accommodate the smaller 3.5"" models and not the xxxW 4.5"" models."
2,is it really necessary,"why did i buy this? i don't like using it, its more of a hasslei think the nuvi holds up fine on its own, i used it without case for a month and it was finewith case, its a little bit bigger. only good thing is its protected from anything that might hurt it in my man-bag, i don't think much would have happened to it either way thoughpocket is pretty much useless"
2,Wrong Size,I purchased this case as an accessory to the Garmin Nuvi 200W but it is not long enough to completely cover the wide screen units.
2,undersized carrying case,"This carrying case is way too small for the Nuvi500 GPS. The GPS sticks out about 1/2 inch at the end. It's so tight a fit it's a struggle to get in and out of the case. I wrote to the shipper about it, but no response."
2,"Overpriced, but what choice do you have?","I'm giving this item 2-stars mainly based upon price. At the time of my purchase, this item is over $12.00. It's a small case that is made in China (what isn't these days) which probably cost around $1.00 to produce. I which other companies would come out with alternative cases. The only one I find is from Case Logic and is over 10-inches long, so it will not fit in many glove compartments, though you can put the power cord inside it. I purchased this case simply because I didn't see another option.I find it amusing that on the back of the package is written ""Durable case protects your GPS and keeps all accessories together. KEEPS ALL ACCESSORIES TOGETHER??? I guess someone in China wrote that also and it got mixed-up in translation. ;-)"
4,PERFECT FIT,The Garmin Nuvi 200 protection case is a PERFECT FIT and prevents any damage by mishandling or accidents.
4,"Nice case, but be careful","This case fits my non-wide Nuvi 250 very well and looks nice too. The open end, however, is a problem. Within two weeks, the Nuvi slid out, fell on the road, and got scratched. Thankfully, the device still worked fine, but when I get another GPS (in 2 or 3 years), I'll get a case that closes all around the GPS."
3,too short!,"Love the Garmin, but this case is just a bit too short! I think the leather case should be longer to offer better protection by completely covering the viewing screen. A fold-over flap style closure would provide superior protection, if available."
2,This case is too small for Nuvi 350,"Garmin product description says that this case is good for any Garmin Nuvi. So I ordered it. When it came, I tried to fit my Nuvi 350 and the case is not long enough! Shouldnt Garmin know the dimensions of their Nuvi's?"
1,Don't buy it,This product fits the Garmin beautifully but it is only for the GPS. There is no space for the windshield mount or charger so I would not waste the money unless you plan to put the case in something else that carries everything that is needed for it to operate. Garmin without the adapter is useless because the battery life is not that great. I bought this against the advise of a friend. I returned the Garmin and the case as well.
2,Poorly Described - Does Not Fit Nuvi 760,"Yes, this fits a Garmin Nuvi, and it says which models it fits on the package when you receive it. Unfortunately, the Amazon description does not tell you which models. I bought a Nuvi 760, and under accessories, this was presented. I ordered it, but when it arrived it was too small for the 760."
1,Not for the Nuvi 760 !,I bought this case with the Nuvi 760 as it appeared on the Amazon page for related products. This is the wrong case for the 760.
1,Wrong size for NUVI 500 series,This is the wrong size case for the NUVI 500 units. The 550 is a 3.5 inch nuvi gps unit.The product title was: Garmin Carrying Case for 3.5-inch nüvi Series GPS NavigatorsThe technical description was : Carry Case For Nuvi(R)Series Travel AssistantThe full product description was buried at the bottom of the web page and it did not say the case would fit the 550. I will admit that I did not get to the bottom of the page.
2,Too small,"I bought a Germin 260W and the ad suggested this would fit. It's too short...by 3"" It sort of works but not really."
1,Received wrong case!,Ordered the Garmin 760 (4.3 inch screen) with matching cases and received the 3 inch case! Very disappointed.
1,To short for 200W,To short for the 200W otherwise it makes a great storage case. Should have been told this.
2,Not the right one,"I have a garmin 260W and I was led to believe that this one would fit, but it is too short. However, it is a nice product for the money and I guess I can live with my garmin protruding about an inch. It would be better if it had some kind of strap that went over the end to keep the garmin from falling out, but mine fits pretty tight.UPDATED. . .I recently purchased a case for my nintedo dshttp://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-DS-Dura-Case-Black/dp/B000V8TZ16/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=videogames&qid;=1225465448&sr;=8-2this case fits my nuvi 260w great. The width and height are perfect. The length is a little longer... just enough to get your finger in there to pull it out. This is a hard case with a rubber lining. You could probably step on it and not hurt it. No room for anything else, but I just use it to protect my nuvi. The best thing, it's only ten bucks!"
1,Carrying Case for the Garmin Nuvi 200W,"The quality of the carying case is good, however, it doesn't fit the product. It should be at least one inch deeper to cover the Garmin 200W."
3,"Great product, but not needed as already included with Nuvi",I purchased this based on Amazon's recommended purchases for my Nuvi 350. Amazon is misleading as the unit already comes with the exact same case.
2,Too big!,"Too big for my Garmin 295W. Say's 3.5"" on plastic wrap it came it, but it looks like a 4.3"" would easily fit in it."
4,"Very good case for Garmin 3.5"" GPS","GPS fits perfectly in the case, it's very pratical, but it could have a better protection in lateral part."
1,NOT AS BIG AS ADVERTISED,"This carrying case pops up as the case to use with the garmin 500. It will NOT fit in this bag. the bag dimensions are listed as 6"" x 5"". This item is really 4"" x 3""."
1,waste of money for the price,they should give this away with the unit it is very cheap and not much protection. Would not recommend to any one
1,Too Small!! Not for the Garmin 200,"Amazon need not ""pair"" this case with the Garmin 200. (Which they do) About 1"" stick out at the end, unprotected. An annoyance as it must now be returned. Grrrrr...."
2,NUVI carrying case,I am sure this works well for the standard NUVI 200 but too small for the 200W and should be advertised as such.Hopefully there will be a bigger one available someday?
1,Frustration,"An inexpensive, simple, small case just fits the Garmin Nuvi and certainly offers some protection from bumps and scratches. So would the toe of a sock or a cardboard box, at a much lower price.Most frustrating, this item measures about 3"" x 4"". The plastic packaging measures about 6"" x 9"" x 1/2"". Amazon says it it too large to ship to my Post Office Box, yet boxes of books are shipped there regularly. At the same time, Amazon refuses to recognize my rural address, which I've been using for more than 18 years. Were it not for the courtesy and cooperation of the University of Wisconsin accepting my mail, I'd have difficulty shopping at Amazom."
1,Garmin Carrying Case,"I bought the carrying case for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. Unfortunately, it is not quite large enough to fully cover the screen. When it is fully in the case, approximately 1/2 inch of the screen is exposed, which sort of defeats the purpose. I was rather disappointed."
2,Nice case but item decsription misleading,"I bought this case for my Garmin GPS and it should have fit according to the description. I received it, gave it as a gift, and it didn't fit. I had to send it back."
1,Nuvi series travel case for Garmin 650W,Bought it in the package deal from Amazon in Oct 2008. Case is too snug. Can't get the GPS 650W in or out without a struggle. It's undersized. Would like to get my money back from Amazon but lost the invoice. It's useless.
1,Doesn't fit the Garmin 200W,"Amazon advertised this as a companion purchase to the Garmin 200W so I ordered it. Its about an inch short covering the 200W. It doesn't cover the wide screen model. It was a gift for my husband's birthday and he thought it was good enough, so we kept it but buyer beware. Amazon, you need to change your site."
1,buyer beware,"case was recommended by Amazon as a match for the GPS I bought. Not so. About 1 inch too short to cover the unit.Sent email to customer service. They said they would correct the error, but made no offer to exchange for the correct item or make any other adjustment.I suppose I could pay $7 shipping to return an $11 item. Instead, I'll approach accessories offered by Amazon with caution. Such are the perils of shopping online. Buyer beware."
2,Bummer,I guess I ordered the wrong case..? Does not fit my 200W too well. As others have mentioned - not worth sending back. What happened - did we all goof on this?
1,Measure your garmin,The cover is too small for the standard garmin nuvi and it's not cost effective to return it. Disappointed
3,Decent Case for the Price,"I bought this case for the Nuvi 255 that I just ordered. It's a perfect fit, and it's small and compact so that you could easily store the item in a glove box or center console. It doesn't have much padding so I'm not sure how much protection you would get if it was accidentally dropped on pavement or concrete, especially on the open end. It would definitely protect the item from scratches and any damage that could accur from daily use inside the car. It has a front pocket that may be for notes but useless for any other type of storage. I like this item because it protects my new purchase and takes up half the space of my old case."
4,Nice quality sleeve for smaller nuvis,"This product has very nice touch and eye appeal. It's slightly different from and better quality than (it appears to be) in the image on the page at Amazon.If you decide to buy it, be aware that it is a cushioned sleeve into which the nuvi slides, not really a full, closed case. It is fairly snug, but I do not know how well it would protect the unit if dropped, particularly on the open side.I like it though, and it's fine to protect the screen when I store it in the glove compartment or center console, or in a coat pocket.Strictly from a functional standpoint though, you can get one of those little Velcro cases they make for digital cameras, for about a third the price. But this case makes you feel nice. So there IS that.Added 12/23/08 - I see that the image of the sleeve has been updated. It does look like this image, and I'm still happy with mine."
3,Garmin Nuvi carrying case,"The case was fine. It's well made and fits like a glove. However, I feel misled into buying it. I bought it because it was listed as a popular add-on (""People who bought this also bought this"".) I was surprised to find that an identical case came with the Garmin Nuvi, so it is totally unneeded. I would not have purchased it if I had known."
4,Basic Case at a good price,"Since I read the reviews and the product specs, I knew this was sized for my new Nuvi 265T, and it protects it just fine when getting transported between cars or tucked away in a storage bin."
3,Does the job..Nothing too fancy,"My wife picked me up a Garmin Nuvi for our anniversary. While I love the GPS, and think I definitely could use a case for it, I'm not completely sure this is the best one for the job. It does provide moderate protection, but isn't something I'd consider a case that would save my GPS during a fall. It protects the device from scratches, dings, and the like, but Zagg's Invisible Shield could do that without the added bulk.I do, however, like that it isn't too bulky. It does a decent job, and still works good enough for me when I travel with my GPS (can't find myself to want to mount it to the car).BTW-If you're looking for a good, hassle-free mounting solution, give the Handstands Sticky Pad a try. No residue, or mess to deal with. Just throw your GPS on there and enjoy."
2,does not fit 200w,"This came as an add on when I bought my Nuvi 200w, only one problem. This pouch is for the Nuvi 200 and not the 200w which is longer. It let 1/3 of the Nuvi stick out so I returned it and went to Wal-Mart and bought a case for a digital camera that fit it just fine."
5,Wouldn't recommend going without one.,I bought this because the first model I got was the Garmin nuvi 630 and it didn't include a case. The Garmin nuvi 660 includes the case and as it turns out I returned the 630 for the 660. Had I known I wouldn't have bought it. But I would not recommend going without this case. It protects the screen on the GPS when you carry it in you pocket. That's one of the nice things about the Nuvi - It's so small you can put it in you pocket.
2,wrong product info,"I am sure its a nice case but why can't the product description say that it is for regular (narrow) screen models?!I bought a wide screen and the top quarter sticks out of the case. True, the dimensions are given and I did notcompare (the bigger is cheaper than the smaller - odd, isn't it) but that is info that should be on top of the product description and the item should not even come up as a valid accessory when ordering a wide screen Garmin. To get to it you have to destroy the annoying packaging which may render the item un-returnable.ALERT/CORRECTIONt: The dimensions given on the web page as of 02/25/09 are entirely wrong in both inches and centimeters! Go to Garmin's web site to determine which model you need, then back to Amazon to purchase there (it's cheaper). Amazon did also take back the wrong item for a refund."
1,NOT THE RIGHT SIZE,I returned this item for a refund because it was not the right one for my garmin. I was informed that it wae recieved by your return department but I haven't seen my credit yet can you look into it and let me know what is happing. THANK YOU
2,Read Description Carefully,"Garmin 010-10723-02 Carrying Case For NuviThis is a well-made case for the navigation unit ONLY. While it fits well and offers obvious protection for the touchscreen, I still have to carry the windshield mounting eqipment separately when I travel. A slightly larger case that had room for the entire setup would have been a much better choice."
3,Garmin carrying case,"Does not fit the widescreen GPS systems, even though it is advertized as an accessory for them. As a carrying case, it is very durable and resiliant!"
3,Carrying case for Garmin nuvi200w,"I'm really disappointed in the case that is supposed to be for the 200W: It isn't long enough to cover the unit completely, yet is supposed to be for all of the nuvi200 units. It's about 5/8"" too short. It is adequate, but not really the right one for this model."
4,Perfect fit,"Garmin Carrying Case was delivered on time, frustration - free package was perfect for the type of product, and was a perfect fit for my new Garmin GPS. The case is open on one side, and holds the GPS unit inside of it through an elastic band that is part of the cases's body. I don't know yet if the case's elastic band will last ... but so far (it's been only a month) the thing does the trick..."
4,Good Case for the Price,Does a good job protecting the touchscreen from scratching or breaking while being stored when not in use. Anyone not satified with this probably ordered the wrong size for their unit.
2,The Shrinking Nuvi 200W cover,"As cool as the carrying case for the Nuvi 200w is, it is too small for the gps itself. Kind of ridiculous. Should be 1 inch longer for optimal protection."
1,outrageous S&H charges - double the stated price,I ordered this case for a new unit I purchased also from Amazon. When I got notice of the purchase I was notified that the handling charges were almost double the stated price on the ad. I have sent three email to the company asking to cancel the order and have not heard back from them.
1,The DVD that should have never been made.,This DVD is a piece of junk. It consists of 5 minute lessons taken from each drummers full DVD. These DVD's are old footage from VHS tapes. The sound quality and picture quality are terrible and the lessons are stupid. Just a couple of licks from the 80's and techniques that won't help you accomplish anything. You would learn more buying one copy of DRUM magazine.
5,Great for making Sushi,"Well here is one of thous things, if you are into cooking and making sushi and want to do it right, this is a must have. Looked all over for a small one and this is the best I found."
5,"Large Hangiri Sushi Oke 14""D","This Large Hangiri Sushi Oke 14""D is really nice, and the price is right! An authentic Hangiri can be very costly. This Hangiri Oke seems to be of good quality, and worth the price. I read that they should be stored upside down, and that has been working out well for me."
3,Bowling Book,This book is mostly for beginners.I had to get to page 60 before there was any detailsfor advanced bowlers.There are little actual pictures for improvement.Text descriptions are brief.If your an advanced bowler - there are better books.
4,Good Resource,"I found this book to be a valuable resource. It would seem to be intended for the serious bowler who has mastered the basics and is looking for more information.The first 35 pages (Preface) covers the history of bowling in the U.S. which is fascinating and I don't recall seeing in any other books on bowling. The pictures of early players and facilities are great.While it has the look of a coffee table book, it is one that, for me, will be a valuable resource. The only item I found detrimental is that it seems more difficult to read. I don't know if it is the font or the point size but larger would have been better."
2,Yikes - don't pay $32 for this book! It's not worth it!,"This book could have been 75% better if 75% had been cut out. There's a ridiculous amount of repeating information in here. The book is written interestingly enough (especially for a history book, hooray novel-ish format!) but holy verbose, Batman.I did not realize this was an LDS book. I almost fainted when the first page was talking about Joseph Smith. Being LDS I didn't mind it, but it definitely narrows down the audience. Actually, I did kind of mind it, because this book is about Joseph Smith as much as William Tyndale. Every other page talks about Smith. Which is fine, but I wasn't actually looking to read a book on him."
2,"almost great, but . . . not","This is not a bad history. Wilcox obviously has talent, and is a fine craftsman. Unfortunately, he loses aim and in doing so, shoots his own foot. This is one of those unfortunate books that is almost great, but... not. In his defense, Wilcox covers the major elements of Tyndale's life and often explores the heart of the translator which he does skillfully. And this alone kept me from returning the book out of pure annoyance. But however lucid and accurate Wilcox was, he spoiled it by continually comparing the life of William Tyndale with Joseph Smith. However important I thought this book might have or could have been, Wilcox deflated it with these forced and ill-fitting comparisons. I don't respond well to stealth evangelism, and neither does the book. Joseph Smith? For the Mormon audience I'm sure Wilcox will get that delicious applause, a lot of warm head nods, and the occasional Amen. Just give me the history I paid for. Not this."
5,Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!,"Informative Yet Concise. Not too overloaded with the minutia so it keeps you reading. I was recommended this book by someone and, although it was hard to read at times when you learn about the suffering of many of the reformers, it helps me appreciate the Bible so much more and the people who sacrificed themselves to make sure we have it. I don't care that it is written by an LDS author. He does a good job extracting the details from Foxe and other historical authors. It's reading book's like this that really help you put your life into perspective. Wow."
4,Kitty finds an Army man,"This is the first one of the MacKenzie books I have read and it won't be the last.This is the romance of Kitty MaKenzie and Jared Fraser. They don't' start out to well as she is mistakenly in his seat on the train and a rude encounter ensues. Kitty is going to visit relatives in the Dallas area, as she needs a change. Her husband has been dead for a while now but she seems to be in the same rut. At the same time Jared it returning home after being wounded in the Army. He is returning home to twin daughters that can't seem to keep a Governess for more than a week or so. One thing leads to another and Jared's father employs Kitty, and the fun begins. First off the girls don't think they need a Governess and want to be rid of Kitty by being pranksters.I liked the development of the characters and their strong family values and the struggles that this presents."
1,I have not received this item,I have not received this item as of yet!! still waiting and losing patience. Today is the last day I should have to wait
2,Doesn't get hot,"I like the size of the curling iron but when I tried to use it, I turned it on high and let it sit. When I went to curl my hair, I could rest my fingers on the barrel for probably more than a minute. It does not get hot AT ALL."
2,Buy Another Curling Iron!,I bought this curling iron over a year ago and had to purchase a replacement. The overall look of the iron itself is like any other but it just does not heat up enough to curl your hair as any decent curling iron should. I had to purchase a replacement so it's better to purchase a more top-of-the-line curling iron than settle for this one.
4,It Blows the Dust Away,What can I say? It blows the dust away. One thing to understand is to press the trigger away from your work when you first use it as fluid might have built up in the tubing. By doing this the fluid is released and not onto your work. Then blow the dust off...a little tip from someone who knows more about it than me.
5,Tied for First,"I just read volume 1 of ""Cable & Deadpool"" it was amazing... it is tied for my personal number 1 Marvel series. Tied with ""Amazing Spiderman"" Volume 1 and ""Wolverine: Enemy of the State."" FYI check those out if you have not.Story - 4.5/5 - very few flawsArtwork - 5/5 - perfectDialogue - 5/5 - Cable is now my favorite marvel character."
5,Cool,"I was never into comics much, but after reading WEB I decided to give this a go. Very cool read."
5,Best character ever!!!!,Deadpool is the greatest comic character of all time! And Cable is such a fantastic straight man opposite the insanity that is Wade Wilson. Love these guys together. Love 'em.
2,Tee and Pullover are Great BUT,The 3 sets of logo tee and pullover made great gifts but the fit is smaller than anticipated. The sets were such a hit with my sons and niece BUT they are afraid to wash them for fear of shrinkage and it is a huge struggle to get their heads through the neck opening of the pullover as the opening is too small/tight.
2,Disappointed in quality,"I was disappointed in this set. It is fair to charge $20 for it, but I thought I was getting a deal. If I knew the quality was so poor, I would have saved my money and just bought a nicer t-shirt. I ordered XL and the t-shirt was more short and fat shaped and I'm not sure how it will fare once we wash it. The Sweatshirt was like 2 sizes smaller even though it was also an XL. It's a decent price, but no bargain here."
2,Package security problem,"The album was great and I love the songs, however when I recived it the case itself had 2 cracks on the front side."
2,Lost the ability to write songs!,"First, this album has a great sound like Exodus's ""Another Lesson in Violence"" & Judas Priest's ""Meltdown"" no problem there. The problem with this effort are the songs. I bought this CD wanting to hear what they had been up to since ""Under The Influence"" and I was really disappointed. ""Taking Over"" was a brilliant album for them, up with everything ever other major player in the genre had released, great songs with a great sound, ""Under.."" had a sound that was too clean and only a few good songs and seems since then they have just lost it. I cannot relate to this CD at all. I will be checking out a post ""Decay.."" album but it looks everything since ""Under.."" to this one doesn't cut it, in my opinion."
3,"Good thrash album, but not quite a masterpiece for me","Years of Decay is a good metal album, but I prefer the earlier Over Kill material like on Feel The Fire. Years of Decay marks the end of an era for the band, as they lost yet another essential member following this record (Rat Skates left right before this album). For me this is really their last album worth owning. It has a cool early-Maiden sound in my opinion, like around the Number of the Beast era, but with a lot more speed and energy."
5,IT MAKES YOUR EARS BLEED!!!,"SMASHING DRUM-PLAYING, THUNDER BASS-PLAYING, SKULL-CRUSHING GUITAR-PLAYING AND A ...-VOICE SINGER WILL SATISFY ANY TRUE METAL-HEAD. OVERKILL'S BEST ALBUM."
5,QUITE POSSIBLY THE BEST THRASH ALBUM EVER!,"All i have to say is WOW!!!!! Anyone who does not own this album has got to buy it, and its so cheap everywhere you find it! Overkill are the kings of crunch riff thrash metal, this album has so many stomp riffs in it you have to watch your neck because OVERKILL WILL WRECK YOUR NECK!!! ENJOY!"
5,"Overkill Rules, Henry Sucks BTW!","Man, that Henry McPruter doesn't even know squat about real music. GET A LIFE LOSER! Overkill kicks the s**t out of Madonna, New Kids On The Block, and Linkin Park anytime. Now about The Years Of Decay, it's a great album. Singer Bobby ""Blitz Ellsworth, guitarist Bobby Gustafson (his last album with the band), bassist D.D. Verni, and drummer Sid Falck are in top form here. From energetic numbers such as Time To Kill, Elimination, I Hate, to the fast crushing closer Evil Never Dies (my favorite song on here), ""The Years Of Decay"" is every 80's thrashers wet dream. Buy it now.Maybe my review will teach that Henry loser a thing or two about real music."
3,The Years Of Decay,"you can definitely tell Over Kill from a lot of the other ""smaller"" Thrash bands. at worst, however, they may come across as an Exodus rip off. but anyway, the riffs on TYOD are pretty driving considering there is only one guitar player. the vocals arent for everyone. i personally dont mind the higher pitched range that bobby 'blitz' ellsworth has but for some it would come across as annoying.if you enjoy Thrash Metal it wouldnt be a bad buy however its far from the ""greatest""."
2,not for casual listening,"For those familiar with the classic 3 Vol text set, one would not expect these lectures to be suitable for the scientifically inclined layperson, nor even the average physics undergrad. But I had expected these audio lectures to be in similar format as the texts, where specific chapters can be played while on a long drive, or trying to sleep at night. First, they are disorganized, with quantum mechanics on Vol 1, while kinectics and heat are on Vol 5, etc..and he constantly refers to this diagram or that equation, as if there should video to watch along. And if you are familiar with his QED book, then imagine listening to a CD of it, with all its diagrams and illustrations. I would not recommend this for anyone who does not have accompanying notes or video. And BTW, it has helped me to go to sleep at night. Thanks Dick!!"
5,Learn from the best- con't,"We purchased this series because we checked them out from the library and decided we should own them. The _Feynman Lectures on Physics_ are great resources for you as a parent desiring to impart these concepts. Feynman explains complex ideas through very simple and entertaining stories. ***** These CDs are a ""must have"" for roadtrips!"
2,Mediocre,"This short book is an effort to provide a ground view of the turning point of the war in North Africa. Focusing on the recollections of number of veterans, the authors depict the sequence of events leading up to the defeat of the Afrika Corps at El Alamein. This story has been told many times previously, and often better. The effort to present the ground view is laudable but not particularly novel. There is little effort to integrate the personal accounts with broader events. The authors also diffuse the impact of the story by including some extraneous events such as the Dieppe raid. The most novel aspect of the book is the detailing of the success of German intelligence in penetrating British battle plans."
3,Not as good as the 1st,"As the 2nd in the series of Stephanie's Menage, I was disappointed. The 1st in the series was great, this seemed very tame in comparision. We met the 2 warriors briefly in the 1st book, so little back story was done here. To tell the truth, I read this story a couple months ago, & remember little of it. I do remember thinking that there were very few sex scenes, but seemed they were put in as an afterthought once the book was finished. Knowing how good the 1st book was, I'm still waiting for the 3rd to come out & see if it resembles the 1st or 2nd book & take a chance with Mari Byrne."
2,*BORED BY CHAPTER TWO*,I thought this book would be so fabulous and I was SO BORED! Too much on and on with details. Details that didn't matter! I couldn't even finish it. Hope this helps.
3,"basics, but could be more thorough","The book covered the major topics of botany, but tended to emphasize dicots, giving the impression all plants are like dicots. I use this for teaching a college course and need to add information on the notable exceptions for plants not used as examples."
3,not a casual read!,"I'm reading this because it is required for my botany class. while much of it is certainly interesting, it is not a casual, fun, book to read. I can't imagine an ordinary gardener (like me) reading this just for fun. It's highly technical full of apical meristems, xylem, phloems and the like."
5,Great handbook,Very good book for the beginning botonist. This book covers all over the major points that my college botony classes covered.
3,New to botony,I want to learn latin names and while it contains the correct info I don't know how to remember names.
3,Botany for more than just beginners,"This definitely is a valuable book for any gardener who's looking for a book on botany. Personally, I was hoping for simpler insights into the miracles that I observe taking place in the garden -- and I did learn a lot from this book. However, while ""Botany for Gardeners"" was touted as elementary, plowing through it (pun intended) proved to require quite a bit of perseverance. Because the book, admirably, covers all the technical matters in the field of botany, it does tend to be, well, technical. (Botany is, after all, a science!) In the end, I would have preferred something like ""Botany for Dummies,"" but, as yet, there's no such title. But ""Botany for Gardeners"" will retain a useful place on my garden bookshelf."
4,Does what it says,"You attach this to a Vivitar 285HV on ""the inside"", and it works well, much better than direct flash."
3,"Works well, fits lousy",This type of product is really a must have. I bought it for my speedlight 430ex. The only problem is that it is made to fit several types of flashes and as such it is held on by pressure. This means it will fall off very easily if brushed against something. Other than that it does exactly what it is made to do. Makes portraits so much warmer. No more glaring flash assisted shots especially when bouncing off of a surface. I would have liked to have been able to try this before I bought it. I might have looked further for one that fit a little better. But perhaps this is as good as it gets.
3,Decent flash diffuser for a good price,"I use this with a Vivitar 285. The diffusion is excellent, but it is a little clumsy to get on and off the flash. It is held by a couple of tabs that don't fit all that well. (I also have a Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce for a Pentax flash that slips over the entire head and it goes on and off very easily.) It kills shadows and spreads the light very well. Since it spreads the light so much, it also drops the flash brightness quite a bit (as expected)."
3,Does what it's supposed to.....,"Just doesn't fit terribly tightly in my Vivitar flash and tends to rattle around, which makes it sound cheap."
1,Bring a crayon...,"This book is colorful but is of little value to those who want to master the MS Office suite (Word, Excel, Access, etc). It may be that MS Office is just to big to cover in one volume; this book certainly failed."
5,A beautiful book with a great storyline for all.,"This is a wonderful story about finding ways to be q part of something even though you don't ""appear"" to have the talent. Holly finds a wonderful way to express her ability to ""grow"" flowers. The drawings in this book are absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail is amazing. Anyone who loves flowers or gardening, both young and old, will love this book! A great gift."
4,A really sweet story,"I'm very impressed with Flashlight Press publications, and this is another good one. I wish I could give it a 4.5/5. The illustrations are not quite on par with other FP publications (they're good illustrations, but not very creative/gripping), but the story is excellent.It's a very sweet, encouraging story for children. I look it when a book can be interesting to read and also have a good moral/message."
5,This CD Rocks!,"If you like Kid Rock, you will love Marc Eric. If you have ever bought a CD and only get one or two songs that are good, you won't be let down by this one, every song on the CD is great."
5,What Rock and Roll was meant to be!,"Let me start by saying that I NEVER write reviews (can't say that anymore), but this is one exception that I had to make.I watched the movie ""High Roller"" but soon found myself more interested in the music than the movie! Once I found Marc's web site, I couldn't stop listening so I immediately ordered the CD. All of the songs are truly moving and beautifully balanced with inspirational lyrics, great vocals, and even greater guitar work.Trust me when I say that this is the rock and roll music you wish you could hear but just can't find anymore these days. You can't go wrong with this CD. It has something to offer for everyone and is by far the best CD I have bought in a very LONG time!Bottom line - Marc Eric's ""Gutshot Straight"" is an absolute must have for all true rock and roll fans!"
3,Freestyle Midsize Shark Black Watch Review,I actually returned this product because it was a lot bigger than I expected (the face) and looked more of a men's watch than a women's. I thought this was unisex but the face is a little too big
4,Algo Grande para mi gusto,"reloj de buena calidad.. de hecho lo compre esperando que fuese muy parecido a uno que tuve hace un par de años y que me duro muchisimo, sin embargo, me parece algo grande para ser usado por una chica... Quizás sean gustos y colores... Aún así ya lo cargo puesto..."
5,Great watch,"Ordered this for my 7 yr old son who wanted a digital watch. He absolutely loves it! It fits him fine on the tightest notch. I has plenty of extra features ( date, a light, etc) and was easy to set. Very happy with it!"
2,CAT TORTURED,"I agree with the reviewer from Sillicon Valley. Sure this movie starts out with a few funny scenes, but it just gets more and more depressing as it goes along. Mental illness, and familial abuse,is just not amusing for a two hour movie. And for cat lovers don't watch this video ! there is a cat rape scene and the cat is realy suffering in this scene, it doesn't look faked. The cat is panting and terrified. But, the boy in the film is very sensative and overly intelligent for his mentally ill family. And there is no clear reason why he is commited to the nut house like the rest of his family, just becuase his mother finds him in a pool of vomit?"
1,"SICK, SICK, SICK","As a cat lover, who had not read a review of this atrocity, I was appalled at the torture of the poor animal in this film. I can't help but wish the director had been hanged above his bathtub instead ofthe lecherous grandfather character. Can't comment on the film after the cat torture scene as that is when I pulled it from the VCR and smashed the tape with a ball peen hammer."
1,SICK DISGUSTING & REVOLTING,"The only useful comment I have found on this section is the one of the viewer who smashed the tape after the cat scene.Without that scene, the movie would just be a boring and meaningless string of unconnected episodes, with no use other of entertaining a bunch of intellectuals who dwelve on terms such as ""poetic"", ""beautiful"" and ""troubled genius"".Then you reach the scene of the cat, which makes blood boil (at least of any person who has a bit of humanity).I would like to tell the reader who intelligently comments on ""Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits"" that I prefer to be a Philistine than a stuck up, posh intellectual who confuses torture with art. Probably next time I'll rent Disney, be sure it won't be Lauzon. I will steer clear of any movie that you will regard as ""wonderful""."
4,"Perverse, deep and difficult to forget","Do not believe the boxcover that portrays this as a delightful comedy about sexual curiosity! Leolo is much darker than that.Here we find a gritty life through the eyes of a youngster who happens to be a bit of a magical realist. Some moments are witty, such as the imagined story of his conception while others are downright awkward and painful.What I liked best about the movie were the several thematic areas it covered in a symbolic and mythical fashion. It addresses an individual's and family's psychological disintegration, the status of the urban underclass, & sexuality. It also portrays the boy, leolo, as a sort of magical escapist messiah for his hopeless family.Leolo also happens to be one of only two films I have seen where a piece of raw liver is violated. (warning for the squeemish) If you are in any way prudish, do avoid this film.In summary, this is an excellent & deep film for viewing with friends if you care to stimulate a strong discussion."
2,skip this one if you're looking for the blues,"To be fair, I've only listened to this album once, and sometimes albums take a while to grow on me. But this collection makes it seem that French women cannot sing the blues! The strongest tracks here come from (American) Abbey Lincoln and Nina Simone; the others are the sort of wispy, breathy fluff that I imagine French parents listened to in the 1960s the way mine listened to Mantovani and Doris Day. You might like this style or not, but it's not the blues, so pass this one up if that's what you're looking for."
4,Well worth the money !,"You know the music was fun to make when you hear the smile in a writer's or singer's voice years, even decades later, as they talk about it. Three years ago, I had the pleasure of interviewing Ellie for 45 minutes, on the air, live. Every story she told sparkled with pleasure that she obviously remembered feeling way back when.Come on, there's always room for more one CD in your collection.Make it this one, because those early records still sound great."
5,Excellent guidebook - best value for money.,"This is the best travel guide of the philippines IMHO. Well puttogether, packed with detailed information and has a slew of helpfulmaps. I'd recommend it to anybody, you won't finda better one. The bookis twice as thick as the Lonely Planet one, and gives you everything youneed to travel on your own. I've seen places described and good valuehotels listed that other guides don't even mention. The author says he'straveled around the philippines for years and I believe him, he seems toknow what he's talking about. A couple times I was really glad I hadthis book with me."
3,Best Option Right Now,"I used it for my 3-week backpacking trip in April 2009. Overall, I'd say it was a decent guide. I'm used to using Lonely Planet and this compares fairly well in terms of details and features. Philippines is changing very fast. Even though the book is updated in Jan '09, a lot ofthe info were already outdated. This can't be helped. The country is too big to keep all the details current. Surf the net for the most updated info. Otherwise, talk to fellow travelers during the trip. They are usually the best source of info.One thing that really irritated me was that this book didn't have any maps of Donsol. It's a very popular destination for the whale shark viewing, but no map of the town??? I had to ask the locals where the lodgings were and consequently got driven all around town in a tricycle for mucho pesos.Lonely Planet is supposed to come out with an updated version in May 2009. I gave it 3 stars since after next month, I would go straight to LP."
3,needs more opinion,"i purchased this product because lonely planet had not yet come out. it provides good information about what is out there but needs to give an opinion/critique of places, restaurants, lodging etc that can help steer the traveller."
5,Great Reviews and ideas for get-aways!,"I had a previous version before I met my wife of 7 yrs. We used it everywhere we went in the Philippines both while dating and after we got married and would return often to the islands. On a previous journey - it disappeared, probably one of wife's sisters!Also has other information that is benefitical from scheduling during better weather patterns to how to survive in the land I call my second home!"
3,Philippines Travel Guide,"We are departing for the Philippines the end of August 2009 and needed some comprehensive guides since we are staying at Timeshare resort and booking all my travel accomodations myself. This is a very good guide, however, very disappointed because I thought I was ordering the 2009 edition. It was cataloged in the 2009 section and although the seller did NOT disclose the publication year, I assumed since they were a seasoned, reputible seller on Amazon that they would have cataloged it correctly. BUYER BEWARE, to my dismay, I received the 2005 edition. I immediately sent an email to complain or to obtain the 2009, I received no response back. This is why I am only rating it a 3, because of the seller's negligence. The book is good, however, outdated!"
4,Phillipines Travel Guide,"Overall a pretty good guidebook with plenty of good information on lodging and lots of good, easy to read maps. I would suggest there is a little too much emphasis on the ""where to eat"" section, and not enough emphasis on the other daily basic needs most travelers have. We don't really need to know where the McDonalds, KFCs and Jollibees are as one can usually spot these places a mile away. We always want to know where are good internet cafes, where to take laundry, and where is the best coffee in town."
4,philippines travel guide,If you only buy one travel guide for the Philippines make sure its this one. Its the most comprehensive and helpful book on the market.
4,Great for Backpacking or Expensive travelling in the Philippines,"Jens captured the top local favorites with places, sights to see, and esp restaurants His quotes on prices and description on lodging is on the mark I just came back from the Philippines and knowing the language and speaking to locals during my backpacking, they were surprised that a German guide book author know their restaurants of choice The only downside is that the author needs to elaborate on some local festivals and also missing information in areas like Cavite, Tagaytay etc But it's definitely a great guide book to have it was my bible during this year's visit and got courageous on venturing out on my own Have fun"
3,Hawaiian Jewelry and Gifts says it is good travel resource,"We are use to the Lonely Planet guide but since the new guide was not coming out for another month we picked up this one as Jen is the truetravel writer for PI...remember he is the one who put little Boracay on the map.Good basic information but missing details related to information neededfor todays tech traveler...he has a whole section in the back with emailcontact address but no websites? He need to let readers know if Internetis available in the rooms or at least a place in each town you can checkyour email. Also I just like one A -Z index in the back for quick findof a location or subject but he has a location index, email index, subject index and it takes a little time to search what I am looking for.My Loney Planet arrives in a few day so looking forward to comparing the two."
3,It's different than most music out,"I like the lyrics, but the production could have been a lot better. You cant really tell if the singer can sing, but it is easy to listen to for a mostly rap album."
2,I am sad,"I bought this printer thinking that I would be an instant millionaire. It turns out that I can't print AMERICAN money on this thing...what a rip! I thought I would be printing of George Washington's on this sucker, but I can only print out Pinochet's. If I wanted Chilean money I would ask for it...I can't even wipe my butt with this stuff because the purple ink stains. I am now sad"
1,Jams - No Support,"I've used this product less than 6 times. Now it's eaten my film and refuses to relinquish it. I've written to their support. NO REPLY! It was 4 frames etc. Everything was within their specs, but crunch. From them? NO HELP! Skip this piece of junk! Now I have a scanner that might as well be a boat anchor, and they don't care!"
4,Great for scanning 35mm Slides,"I had a great experience using this scanner for archiving and getting images online. If you need to get your 35mm slides scanned and organized, this is all you need. Great for the price, but the tech support wasn't very impressive in my experience."
1,a tacky rip off of a classy detective,"A pity that you cannot award ZERO stars....the movie is an insulting tacky portrayal of one of the best female detectives....V I is an original, a cross between the 1930's hard boiled ""dick"" genre and a brilliant & talented woman who all to often wears her heart on her sleave...but figures it all out!No wonder why there were no other movie versions of Sara Paretsky Heroin, after this insulting and some what misogynistic attempt at a movie.Please save your $ to buy Sara Paretsky's books...they will not disappoint!"
2,V.I. = Very Insignificant,"I watched this because I teach film and many feminist film journals contain critiques of the film. Also, I had just watched Body Heat, starring Kathleen Turner, for maybe the 10th time, Turner's signature film. Unfortunately the content is weak, lacks drama, conclusion is telegraphed miles in advance and Turner tries to hard to be the tough ""ballsy"" cop with a heart of gold. Compared to her best work, this one is a limp noodle and not worth the feminist attention it has received. If you're looking for a good female cop movie, try Silence of the Lambs or Black Widow. Charles Bland, Niagara Falls NY"
5,movie,Good movie. Kathleen Turner plays a little different roll for Kathleen Turner in the movie. Suspenseful as well. ok for kids.
1,NOT Playable in United States,"Region 2 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.)This DVD is not playable on American DVD players. The seller does NOT include that information in their own description and the only place it is displayed is below the main screen listing for the product information, where you will NOT see it until it is too late."
3,What's not to like?,"This likeable, harmless Kathleen Turner vehicle is one of those films that most ""name"" critics have viciously attacked for no logical reasons (critics seem to be as frequently susceptible amongst themselves to ""herd mentality"" as the rest of us po' ignorant movin' pitcher watchin' folk). Turner's ""V.I. Warshawski"" is a very credible ""tough broad"" character,treading the fine line between sexiness and surliness with skill and style. Granted, the predictable, standard-issue plot of this detective thriller is a minus, but the appealing cast and Turner's charisma carry the day. If you are a fan of the Warshawski books (or J.A. Jance and Sue Grafton's female detective stories)you'll find the mood and atmosphere of the film quite true to the genre.If your name is Leonard Maltin, take a pill and just relax."
5,V.I. Warshawski,"Great movie with Kathleen Turner bringing a tough, smart-ass private detective to life protecting a young girl. I hadn't seen this in years and it was excellent in blu-ray."
4,v.i. greatly portrayed byTurner!,THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT WITH A LITTLE HELP COULD OFFER LOTS OF SEQUELS OR TURNED TO A SUCCESSFUL SERIES WITH KATHLEEN.KATHLEEN IF YOU READ THIS YOU DID A GREAT JOB!ANOTHER GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT A WOMAN IS ON THE MAIN ROLE AND SHE CAN BE HOT AND TOUGH ALL IN ONE PERSON.HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO THOSE WHO LOVE KATHLEEN AND BELIEVE IN WOMAN'S POWER AND SUPERIORITY!
5,Great Product Good Seller,"I've used the product for many years and it's an excellent product for what it intent is. You can also use a combination of Toppik with it and provide even better results.The seller shipped quickly, product was just as I ordered, good price and well worth the experience."
4,Carrying Case for the Cybershot DSC-R1,"Item is well made and will protect your camera. The only draw back is that it is big and bulky, and when you use the camera, you have to unsnap the cover. There's no place it but to hold on to it or leave that part at home. Other than that, great protection for that investment."
4,"Does the job - not great, though!","This bag does what it was intended to do: protect the camera. However, in the field it is a bit cumbersome. To shoot properly, one should remove completely the main cover, as it is large and if left swinging, makes it harder to handle the camera. I found that when I was shooting pictures often I just removed entirely the main cover leaving only the part that screws to the bottom of the camera. That piece actually improves, in my opinion, the grip and feel of the camera.With time, removing the cover becomes second nature. I do not find it an inconvenience the fact that the memory ports are covered. I usually load high capacity memory stick and compact flash and can take hundreds of pictures before I need to replace them.Overall, I recommend this bag. If you need to carry accessories, all the time, this bag is not for you."
2,Mistaken identity,"I saw the stage play of Shockheaded Peter and its really terrific, with amazing staging and fantastic puppets. I thought this was a film of that show, but it is not. This simply follows the band, who performs some of the songs live, without the stage production. My mistake!"
4,"Cheesecake-good, shipping-no good","cheesecake was very good but shipping of this item was not good. more people might use this service if shipping charges weren't so extremely high. it is a convenience but it needs to be more economical,especially in the recession were in."
5,Marvelous Book!,"This book is a joy to browse through, to read and to admire the photographs. Every page shows the author's passion towards the lions of Savuti, a magical and wild place in Northern Botswana. Derek and Beverly Joubert spend years in that place filming and photographing lions and other denizens of this wilderness. The book is proliferated with exceptional photographs of lions interacting with other animals. We see lions hunting, resting, playing and communicating with each other. There is a series of unique photographs portraying lions killing an elephant calf. There is a great photograph of a running lioness during a hunt, an aerial photograph of a running buffalo herd. I can go on and on. You get the drift. The text is interesting and at times seems almost poetic. ""Hunting with the Moon"" is one of a few must-have books for a true lover of African wildlife. In other words, great book!"
4,Hunting With the Moon: The Lions of Savuti,Hunting With the Moon: The Lions of Savuti was sent on time and arrived in good condition.
4,Very cute,"The dino cutout that is glued to this wall rack is very cute. I wish it was a bit bigger, but I'm overall pleased with the look and construction. There are red hanging knobs which may be too thick for hanging coats and other clothes without hoods, otherwise, I like this little decorative piece for my dinosaur nursery."
5,One of the best classic PI Shows,I loved this series but often couldn't stay up that late (it came on after Magnum P.I.) so it is fun to re-live my childhood and watch these great episodes. Season five is only available directly from SHOUT. Thank you Amazon for carrying the first four seasons!
5,Ahhh the 80's,This was a simple show to make but filled a void after some running shows left the air. Who knew.
3,Take other review with grain of salt,"The first season was the best and I think it went down in quality from there. I prefer the original theme song, the quaint storylines, and just the vibe of the show from that season. Also A.J. had the 57 Chevy that season and then went to the Camaro (ugh). Oh and as for the reviewer that said Rockford had money - uh, no, in fact he barely got by, lived in a trailer and the show kind of always poked fun at his cash flow problems. Also, while the Simons were not rolling in dough, a 57 Chevy and a Camaro are not exactly cheap cars."
3,JUST OK,I ordered this after seeing all of the DETECTIVE MONTALBANO sets and it is not in the same class. My Wife and I have decided not to buy any more Octopus DVD'S. If someone gave me one I would watch it.
5,Satisfied,"Great job by Amazon as usual. These maracas are great and with the P.R. flag painted on them, even better."
1,question,"is it really necessary to take minute-long solos in every song? Really? If you like your solos long-winded and lacking in destination, and your lyrics trite (Get a Job???), check these guys out. If you actually plan on listening to the music you buy, skip it."
2,Greyboy????,"Listening to this album puzzled me. I went into it ...backwards, I liked Greyboy's later stuff, so I figured I'd check out this band. I was disappointed. This is really groovy and the musicians aren't bad, but it's like one of those Jam band things. I don't mind jam bands, but their sound is too loosely wrought for me. And there is a little too much noodling with instruments that seems a little aimless. If you like the Greyboy Allstars, you will probably like this. But if you are buying this for Greyboy, don't."
4,Tight,"I gave this CD a very generous four stars simply because the band is very tight and they lay down a VERY solid groove. My only complaint is that the songs aren't really that diverse, they all revolve around simple blues scales and don't really leave the realm of the penetonic minor. Their skill does make up for it though and that is what makes this a worthwhile album to own. The solos are passionate and soulful but the actual songs lack diversity. But I still like this album and recomend it to anyone who just wants some funky stuff to listen to."
4,Good English History,This is an excellent book whether for an English History Fanatic or someone who is more new to the subject.
4,Faith and Treason,Interesting history about a generally misunderstood event of British political upheaval. Antona Fraser is a reliable and apt reporter about issues of another time.
5,Explosive look at Traditional English Attitude toward Catholics,"Guy Fawkes Day is still celebrated in England with fireworks and mock burnings of him in effigy. I wondered about this celebration and this book was recommended. I find Tudor and Stuart England absolutely fascinating and this book shed light on an incident that is little known and not taught in the States. English recalcitrant Catholics hoped James I's reign would usher in more tolerance. However, it was abundantly clear that tolerance would not be forthcoming from the King and Parliament continuing the oppression from Elizabeth's reign. The Catholics did themselves no favor in trying to blow up Parliament and kill the king. The immediate consequences were severe - there are details about what hung, drawn, and quartered really means - and an even deeper distrust of Catholics was ingrained into the English psyche. This is a great read!"
4,All there is to know on the subject!,"Antinia Fraser writes a comprehensive history of teh Gunpowder plot and spends a few chapters on the history of Elizabeth I and what lead up to the Plot taking places under James I, Elizabeth's successor. Ms. Fraser has a tendency to be a bit dry and load you with facts. However, on the whole, it certainly covers a subject I knew next to nothing about and I was very satisfied in the end. A slow read, but an interesting one."
3,Thorough and Thought-provoking,"There are two types of history books nowadays: the popular versions which use a readable style and concentrate on events; and the academic style which are less digestible and more demanding of the reader. With this book Ms Fraser has plotted a central path which has produced a very readable book (indeed, I read it on a succession of plane flights) yet conceded nothing to popular history.The style is exciting and intriguing, which provokes that rare desire to keep on reading. The book is written with a clear aim of showing how and why the Gunpowder Conspirators found themselves acting as they did and it shows the many flavours of opinion which existed at the time. Most intriguing is the way Ms Fraser reveals the opposition the plotters faced from the Catholic establishment and the extent to which the King and Government created the situation in which some people felt driven to attempt Regicide on a grand scale.An exciting read with strong academic value."
5,Best Hair Dryer Ever,"I highly recommend this hair dryer. It's light and has lots of power. The high setting gets nice and hot, perfect for roll brushing curls. They last for a very long time. I'll be using this style hair dryer for as long as they make them!"
5,Great CF Card!,"I use this brand of CF card when shooting professional photos for an online magazine. They have never let me down yet and I take 1,000+ photos per session."
4,does the job,"I use this media to save audio on my drum machine, a mpc 2000xl mcd. I wasn't sure if this size card and brand would work but it did, however I did lose 1gb of space what I formated the card on my mpc"
1,Lost photos,"I bought two of these card because of the price. I typical buy SanDisk Ultras. But I thought this would be a better deal.I was wrongThe first card was working find without problems. I have many photos on in. But something happened and when I put in the card reader it now says the disk is corrupt. I was able to finally open the card but many of the images have green, blue and pink bars on them. These were images I had taken weeks ago.My second disk has one of my best photos now showing a gray bar half way on it. And when I shoot a picture, the image will not transfer to my Mac. It is not the camera, put one of my trusty SanDisks in and it worked fine.I'm very upset because many of my photos were from a big special event and now they are lost."
5,Good Price,Kingston makes great memory cards. Ive been using with Cannon 30D and have had no problems.
1,QC off or Damaged in transit,This card was either manufactured poorly or was damaged during or prior to shipment. I use it in my auto sound system and it works about half the time. The compact flash cards manufactured by Ativa have worked without a problem for 2 plus years.
1,Kingston 2GB Flash cards Not Working,"These cards may be made by different sub-contractors, and as a result, the latest batch I ordered did not work properly with my trail cameras. The cameras communicate with the cards, and these cards were delaying rapid fire up to 6 seconds between photos instead of no delay. I inserted San Disks and the problem was reconciled somewhat. Be careful, you get what you pay for."
5,Good CF card for Digital SLR camera,"I purchased this CF card for my Canon EOS 30d. I have owned this product since last September, and i have not had any problems so far, and i don't expect to. There is nothing i can really elaborate on, it's a storage card. As far as i can see, it's a good option. This is a good product for your electronic devices."
2,not what I wanted,"I bought this cd for the accompaniment of ""Hound Dog."" It is the Elvis version of Hound Dog, not the version from Smokey Joe's Cafe."
4,Very nice but . . .,"This is a handsome pedestal made of cast aluminum. It did not fit the armillary, but after about an hour of modifications, it did fine. Since it's soft metal, re-drilling was no problem."
1,deceptive description,i thought i was buying my daughter a sundial. the product is only a pedestal. it was very disappointing.
4,Dead Zone - Season 1 & 2,Dead Zone is a very entertaining show. Anthony Michael Hall and cast have a wonderful chemstry. I've very much enjoyed all the seasons to date.
5,The Dead Zone,"As another reviewer commented, I was not at all sure about Hall, having recalled his teen movies of the 80s. What a surprise! I caught an episode haphazardly, while cleaning house, ande found myself abandoning the cleaning (really--I didn't WANT to quit cleaning!) to watch the entire show. I was hooked and have been since then-catching reruns in order to catch up.Hall is excellent and the stories are primo--the writing is much like X-Files in terms of thougtfulness and quality.My one regret is that the initial theme song has changed in the new season. I loved the spooky, haunting quality of the early theme. Is this on CD? I loved that soundtrack.One comment to improve the show (not that it needs any improvement): please give DeBoer something more to do than be sad-eyed eye candy. She is a pivotal character and I would like to see her in an episode that makes use of her talents (not just her cuteness quotient) a lot more."
3,DEAD ZONE---ALMOST DEAD,"This was kind of hard to follow since i didnt have season one, but i really like the flashbacks and how it (attempts) to explain things, will re-vamp my review after i see season one (which i just ordered)"
2,Not worth it,"This book is all over the map, alternating between motivational gibberish (""Don't EVER give up!""), basic financial theory (""Spend less than you earn"") and dangerous advice (""Make your money grow at least 20% monthly""). Read ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" instead. It's cheaper and it has better advice."
1,TOO BASIC!!,"If you are in High School or know very little about Successor Financial Principles, then this book might be for you.Otherwise for anyone else,this is nothing more than basicmotivational pap that can be found in thousands of otherself-help books. NOT WORTH IT!"
4,Great for yoga,"As a yoga teacher, I use this little gadget in my yoga classes to time the meditations and the length of hold in the asanas. The 1, 3 and 5 minute times are perfect for this use; without fumbling with a digital or pulling on reading glasses to see numbers. It's easy to see the color of the sand as it spills down the inside of the glass tube. Plus, the fact that it's silent is nice in the quiet of a yoga setting. The only drawback is that, sometimes, the glass tubes will tend to pop out if you're totting the timer around; one of the glass vials broke and I had to reorder another unit. (Unless I just failed to notice one of my students sneaking up and snapping the 5 minute timer vial after a grueling hold in Downward Dog.) On the recommendation of another reviewer, I used a drop of flexible adhesive at the tips to keep them in place. It's a great little gadget, well made, and fully worth the price."
5,The Young Ruth Brown,"I first heard Ruth Brown's Wild Wild Young Men on a local blues show. I bought the CD to get that song. I listened to samples of the rest of the CD and thought it would be nice in my collection. Wow was I pleasantly surprised. I think just about every song on both CD's is a winner. I like Ruth's new stuff, she still can belt it out. The energy and quality of her ""young"" voice of the fifties really sends me. If you like the post war era and roots of rock and roll then this is I believe a good choice to add to your collection. As for me I love the slight naughtiness in songs of this period. I could name them all but a few good examples on this CD would be... Lucky Lips, This Girl's Gone Rockin', Love Contest, 5-10-15 Hours and of course Wild Wild Young Men. I am certainly not learned like many other reviewers, I just like this one and play it alot. Like they used to say ""it's got a great beat and you can certainly dance to it."""
3,"Astringent aftertaste, no foil or paper packaging","I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey."
3,Disappointed,"Before I purchased this tea from Amazon, I had tasted an individually-wrapped SAMPLING of Ahmad English Tea #1 that was to die for. But when I received the whole box that I ordered from Amazon (where each bag was not individually wrapped), the tea didn't have the same divine flavor as the sample I previously had tasted. It's nice, but not special."
1,I hate it,"This tea does not smell or taste like Twinings or Bigelows Earl Grey tea....it has a ""soapy"" smell and taste andI was very disappointed and the purchase is listed by Amazon as NOT RETURNABLE!!"
1,Outrageous shipping costs!!,$45 to ship this item - ridiculous! The seller says it weighs 71 lbs...lol! What do they use for packing material - bricks?! Check around first before you accept these shipping rates. The shipping weight of the item is actually around 18 lbs.
1,where is my marchioro cage?,"I would love to review this product that I ordered on Nov 27, but as of today Dec 30 I have not received it."
2,no instructions!,We bought this cage because of it's size. It is nice and big but came with no assembly instructions. Everything is intuitive except the door latches. We have ended up just keeping the doors tied closed which is very impractical!
4,"For a Class, but Good View","Although at times the book can become a bit boring as Dalos followed Akhmatova's life, mainly because Akhmatova seems to have accepted her fate in a somewhat over-bearing, dramatic fashion, the author manages to showcase the censure of the Communist U.S.S.R.; particularly the paranoia born under Stalin. Without annoying flourish, although slightly stilted language at times due to the translation more than the author's flow, Dalos relates an important time in the life of many people in a fascinatingly factual way. In any event, the book is definitely not a staid history novel."
5,"adorable, excellent price","This is a very adorable and affordable (especially with free shipping!) set. The logo is a little bear, very cute. Fully lined, and better quality than I expected. Made by Tendertoes."
1,Bad,"So I had to buy this book for an art major class at school and it is horrible. She makes some good points throughout the book but overall this is what she thinks-you need to make political art-the best art in the world is political art-i, the author, am a wonderful all knowing, person who overcame all these difficulties and thus am fabulous-women have an unfair disadvantage in the art world-i, the author, will talk endlessly about my self, my beliefs on political art, and babble on, go on tangents, and waste you money, and paper by publishing this book.The other (not mentioned) interesting points, can be brought up through discussion of this book, but you do not need to read the whole thing, you don't actually need to read this book, only to think about art."
2,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I got this as a christmas present, and was sorely disappointed. Avid music listener as I am, I immediately plugged my iPod in to the iMode. I was disappointed to find that the sound quality lacked depth and fullness. In fact, I have an aged set of speakers from Altec Lansing (which I bought for maybe $10 at a garage sale) and their sound quality is exponentially better than the iMode's. And when I play my music loudly, the iMode makes a rattling noise, because apparently one of the buttons is a bit loose. Oh, and I set the alarm this morning, and I have no idea what happened, but it didn't go off. If you're looking for an alarm clock for your ipod with good sound quality, look elsewhere. My friend has the iPlace (I think), and it sounds much better than mine."
1,waste of money,My daughter was given an iMODE docking station for Christmas and it is already broken. The piece that the iPod attaches to just broke off. I am extremely disappointed in this product. DON'T waste your money on this item.
1,Keep looking!,Really...Keep looking. You don't want this...not even as an alarm clock. It's terribly hard to set the time or the alarm and the sound quality is horrendous! Spend a few extra bucks and get something better.
1,a joke?,This album just plain sucks. Any real hip hop fan should think twice before they plan on purchasing this soon to be coaster.
1,This album wasn't very good.,This is one of worst albums i've heard in a while. The lyrics are incoherent and the beats are even worst. This group will not go far unless they mature.
4,Fantasy for those who don't read fantasy,"If, like me, you don't read many fantasy books, this book might actually be good enough to lure you in.In a not too distant future when a couple of bio-hazard accidents wipe out much of the population and even more of the technology, the human race struggles to survive. With a gender ratio all out of wack, Califia's Daughters -- the women of what was once California -- struggle to farm the land, feed and protect their communities, and above all protect the fragilest flowers of them all, the males of the species who have trouble surviving to reproductive adulthood.Leigh Richards is a pseudonym the author's note tells us for Laurie R. King, author of several award winning mysteries. It's no mystery why the writing and plotting here are smooth, engaging, and a joy to read."
3,Good but it could have been better,"I'm a fan of these end of the world or women-run world fictions. This book, however, reads like two books. The first is about a community whose world we see through several different eyes. The second is the story of Dian who travels to investigate another community who have asked to be allowed to move into her valley. The problem is that a lot of the characters from the first ""book"" are left hanging after the reader gets interested in them and the focus in the second ""book"" honestly isn't very clear -- after reading it I'm still not sure why Dian does what she does and why there's not time spent on the fact that when she first visits the foreign community it looks radically different than when she returns just a few months later -- they've been invaded I assume but that isn't clear and it seems like everyone has been living a very military life there for a long time. Overall I was disappointed."
4,Very nice read,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I really enjoyed it. Not a particularly deep read, and less about sexual stereotypes than you might think. It's a densely plotted adventure story, about a woman who pushes herself to physical, emotional, and moral extremes."
2,So dissapointed,"It started out well with a good premise and interesting characters, then switched gears halfway through focusing on just one character. The plot wandered and died as though the author ran out of inspiration."
2,Review of service - not book content,"The paperback version( a new, not used book) of Califia's Daughters was unreadable. The type on every left hand page was so light as to be impossible to read with any kind of flow. Add to this, it took 3 weeks to arrive - I was not happy."
5,Fantastic for high school students getting ready for SAT or ACT!,"As a high school English teacher, I am always looking for new ways to get my students to learn vocabulary, not just memorize words to regergitate for a quiz. This book is fantastic! It breaks vocabulary down by roots (Latin, Greek, etc.) and then has four words per root. Every two roots has a quiz and at the end of a unit there is a larger test that incorporates the past six or seven roots. There is an answer key in the back of to book too! Kids that buy into this method of learning are, therefore, learning to recognize meanings without actually knowing what words mean. For example and for SAT and ACT purposes, if they were given analogies or asked for synonyms or antonyms, kids could figure out what the meanings were by knowing roots. I have loved using it in my classroom so far this year!"
1,egads,"JUNK..!!! I can't believe that this POS was even printed! Parents, whatever you do, don't get this for your kids because it is full of garbage! And that, folks, is fair dinkum."
4,Girls Gone Wild Doggy Style.,"I've seen several of the other girls gone wild dvd's, This one has snoop dogg as the host, he smokes alot of chronic and narrates most of the action. 90% is all flashing, there is about 2 girlongirl action scenes.. And 5 or 6 kitty shots..They do a good job but i think the main seller for this one was ment to be snoop himself, and he's not my type of college chiq :)Not a bust, Definantly a girls gone wild production. Check out Dorm room fantisies for the hardcore...."
2,LAME,"First off, way too short and too much Snoop talking.Also this is like 99% flashing. And most of the girls have average to small sized boobs. The only t*****s I enjoyed were the one bar girl with gigantic ones. The girls here are supposed to have gigantic monsterous breasts. But they don't. But the biggest flaw is there are only like 2 girls in the whole movie that show their vaginas. What is the deal with that? Only two girls take down their panties. And they don't even get in explicit positions. They don't even spread their legs and show us the good stuff! I mean one of them touches herself but it is just OK, she doesn't get dirty enough. The other GGW films are much better. The vagina is the essence of a female, you have to show her privates. Buy this if you want some inoccent topless fun but if you want to see real hot girls get nude (meaning vagina exposed) get one of the other releases by GGW."
4,My husband used to own it so I bought it as a present for him!,He absolutely loves this edition of girls gone wild he thinks snoop dog is hilarious!!! When he got it he was very happy!
2,Radio but no TV,I'm only giving this 2 stars because even though the radio and flashlights work the TV does not because it is not digital
3,"Lantern, flashlight, and radio.","Lantern, flashlight, weatherband radio, and B&W Tv in 1 hand. Add a 12 pack of D batteries, a bowl of popcorn, and a coke. Enjoy when the power goes off. Not a digital reciever."
5,Great purchase,"This was a gift for a relative that lives out of country. TV image is good enough, radio and lantern are a great addition.I'm very satisfied with it, for the price (around $10), it's a great purchase."
2,Ok for the money...but..TV will be obsolete.,"I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts, and was so pleased with how they worked and looked. Then I was reminded that in Feb 2009, all TV's will go digital and the tv part of this product will not work.So, basically all you can use is the radio, flashlight and weatherband. I thought there should have been a notice posted about the tv."
1,Disapointed,Was very disappointed in this product. I live close to NYC and TV reception is usually very good but almost non existant on this TV. Buy it for the radio or other features but dont expect too much from the tv.
3,Don't waste your time with the gift set.,"I love Anchorman but I was really disappointed with the ""Wake Up, Ron Burgundy"" DVD. I guess there was a very good reason they re-filmed the second half of the movie!Don't waste your money on the gift set (like I did). Just buy the actual movie and spend half the money!"
2,Will finally made an un-funny movie,"I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell. The man can walk into a room, saying nothing but wearing a wig, and I laugh. And yet this movie is not funny. One or two smirks, but not a single laugh. Elf was hilarious. Loved him in Zoolander. But this was lame.I'm not sure what the problem is -- maybe its the fact that instead of being totally ridiculous, they're trying to sneak some kind of moral or something into the story, but it just doesn't work. And I think the lewdness gets to be a hindrance of just about every buildup to a joke.Oh wait, there is the scene where he eats the cat poop. I liked that part. And the jazz flute. Ok, the club scenes were alright. And Jack Black punting the dog. Loved that. But that's about it."
1,Minus 5 stars! Nothing But One-Note COKE JOKES!,"This abhorrent movie verifies what I've been thinking a long time-that so-called comedy writers get so coked-up (not Coca Cola if you get the drift) that even grocery lists would be fall on the floor funny. Who in the hell greenlighted this lame thing? Probably a coked-up producer.The title name is not funny, the idea is not funny, Will Ferrell is NOT funny, not pretty to look at (white, fat, flabby, hairy, eyes too close together!)and the movie is nothing more than one very long sexual harrassment joke from the 70's. Having worked in that era and constantly being groped and dirty joked by co-workers who were stuntedly developed as horny 14 year olds, why would I want to relive that? I tried to watch it on HBO, but after 10 minutes, there was nothing new to see. This is just one more reason Hollywood box office receipts are taking a huge hit this year."
2,Not Bad but jab at Bush at end lowers it a star,"This is a pretty funny movie that succeeds because it seems to fly in the face of political correctness. I thought ""wow, he must be getting feminists really angry with this film"" and it was nice to think of Ferrell as being free from the Hollywood requirement to think alike. Then he throws in a useless and cliched jab at President Bush at the end (I am no fan of Bush) and I lost all respect for him. It was like he did not have the guts to fully carry out this assault on political correctness and let his fans down in the end in order to kowtow to the very people he mocks the whole movie. It reminded me of the racists who say ""well i am not a racist since I have a black friend."" Pathetic."
1,Pure Tripe....Crap,"I love comedy, always have. I like Will Farrell. This is just pure dog poo. I resent my cable company charging me $3.95 to watch 20 minutes of this stuff. How does it get financed? Surely you don't have to be smart to be rich. Oh well, what should I expect as an old man, the darn french gave Jerry Lewis a lordship or such. Curse high IQ's"
1,Stupid--Not Funny,"I have not seen a movie this bad in a long time. Sometimes stupid is funny, NOT here. This is just plain stupid. Don't waste your time on this waste of film..."
4,Laugh out loud funny!!!,"I can't understand why so many people gave this movie such negative reviews. I've seen this movie twice and thought it was absolutely hilarious, and so did everyone else in the theatre. I haven't laughed that hard or heard more people laugh at a movie in a long time. I consider myself to have a sophisticated humor, and I still found this movie to be really enjoyable. I highly recommend it!"
5,I love Lamp!!,"It has taken me around a year and a half to find this double pack set and im really glad I didnt cave in and just buy the bog standard Region 2 release.(Thanks Movieandmusicman)The second disc with the 'Alternate Movie' Wake up Ron Burgandy is just as rich in special features as the main disc!Both of these films will also give you a boat load of quotable lines that are funny no matter how many times you hear them.I cant beleive the ""Glass Case of Emotion"" scene didnt get an Oscar nod!If you havent seen it yet, What are you wiating for"
1,Tony Bennett on acid,"Sorry Rod, but I've heard this stuff, and I have to say this is pure garbage. It hurts me to say this too. What happen to you. Stick with the rock and roll you know like Maggie May, Stay With Me, Hot Legs, remember these, or are you getting senile. I loved you in The Jeff Beck Group, Faces, or even early you or 80's you, but swinger Rod, I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not what I expected,I expected the Rod Stewart raspy voice that I'm accustomed to and what I found was a voice of a little girl. These are songs I listened to growing up in my mother's house and love them. Very disappointed.
3,Rod Stewart The great american songbook.,"Disappointed in it!!When you hear great american songbook, I was thinking that it was all of HIS great hit. Nothing on there screams ROD STEWART! None of his great song are on it, and I bought this as a christmas gift. The Name and title are very misleading, so do understand none of HIS great songs are on it. :("
3,The Thing,"Rod, assaying these superb examples of American songcraft, reminds me of the Thing, in the Fantastic Four movie, trying to pick up a dime...his big, clunky hands of stone just don't have the touch, the sensitivity to do it. Rod, tackling these classics, is in exactly the same boat: he doesn't have the finesse, sensitivity or sophistication to bring it off...And, just for the record, I do like his voice, find it very pleasant, and am in fact, a big fan of his early era recordings, particularly those he made with the Faces."
5,cd review,This es a great CD. Rod singing the old songs already made famous was great to listen to. I have the other ones he has made and this is one of the better ones
1,Wake me when it is over!,"I have been a serious CTD fan for many years travelling out of state to catch their shows. Over the years this band evolved their unique and exciting sound through 3 great albums. Yet, with this new release the Dummies chose to completely change into another dreary techno band. Each song on the disc drones on to the next sleeper. Where the band's previous lyrics were full of wit these lyrics are just childish. The slow repetitive drum beats in every song are a waste of musical talent and creativity. This is by far the most boring CD I have ever heard and I really wanted to like it! It is not just a worthless CD from the Dummies but a worthless CD in general."
1,What Happened?,"After getting excited about the new Dummies' release, my happy excitement soon turned to blah sadness! This album is the worst I have heard in years! This ""experiment"" did not work! It is filled with trip hop lame beats and rambling meaningless lyrics. At the end of the 12th song, this cd had me crying: Why, oh Why!? .......another 15 bucks down the drain."
1,Avoid this one if you are on a budget,"This CD came with a warning label to the effect that this is not your usual CTD recording. What an understatement! Unlike A Worm's Life, which I came to like after a second listening, this recording contains only a few tracks that I can listen to in their entirety. If you like street-language rap, graceless sexual references, songs which rely on a heavy beat to mask their lack of musicality and message, and are prepared for CTD lyrics to deliver a numbing lack of profundity, this CD is you.P.S. I am sure the band had fun recording this one; it's just not much fun to listen to."
3,Middling Dummies,"Having owned this album since the day it was released -- and having recently seen the Dummies live in support of the new ""I Don't Care That You Don't Mind"" -- I can begin to see it in perpective.1) These guys can't record a truly awful album, try as they might. I'd take that any day over 95% of what I hear on the radio.2) The three Ellen Reid tracks are great; her new solo album should be a real treat.3) It may be about sex, drugs, et al, but that doesn't mean it isn't witty. ""I Want to Party!"" get funnier with each listen.It's no ""God Shuffled His Feet"" (their most popular) or ""Worm's Life"" (their best), but it's worth a listen."
5,not what I expected,"This album certainly wasn't what I expected. I love God Shuffled His Feet. Give Yourself a Hand is an entirely different animal. But it's the sort of animal you can't help but love- affectionate, likes to be pet, does a little dance if you hold up a treat, and humps your leg at every opportunity. You may be put off by it at first, but it will soon charm you.Keep an open mind and give it a proper try and you shan't be disappointed."
1,Terrible,A good band gone bad. I will never buyanother CTD cd without listening to it first. I wish there was some way to get my money back. Every time I think of the money I wasted I get aggravated all over again! Very disappointed.
2,This is no longer the Crash Test Dummies...,"I first heard of the Crash Test Dummies when they released the second album ""God Shuffled His Feet"". - And THATS a 5- star one. This is, I dont know, what happened to Mr. Brad Roberts dark voice? Thats what distinguish C T D. He isnt using that dark tones anymore... And ""I want to Par-Tay"", thats sound like something BECK would do. Crash Test Dummies isnt Beck. So for the next album, more of Mr. Robert's voice and more air and melody and get rid of those synthizizers! Then I will get back and give it a 5-star..."
2,"Um, yeah, okay...","I'm wondering what hideously tragic accident Brad Roberts was in, as his voice has shifted up about 100 octaves. Although I love Elen Reid's additions to this album (perhaps she should embark on a solo project!), I'm afraid it was just a bit too different for my tastes. Not the CTD I've come to love over the years. Though it may grow on me in time."
1,What a mistake,This CD was the worst pile of cacophony that I've experienced in a long time. I wasted an hour of my life and some of my paycheck listening to this rubbish.
1,This is God awful,"What a major let down. This album is garbage. Do not waste your $13. If you are a fan of CTD you will be sorely disappointed with this effort. It is dumbed down techno pop, I guess trying to get mass appeal. My only hope is that my CD will biodegrade fast in whatever landfill it deservedly ended up at. I'd hate for future archeologists to find it and think this was the best our era had to offer in music. I repeat, do not waste your money on this album it is crap!!!!!"
1,Another Drop in the Electronica Bucket,"I hope the Dummies aren't out of ideas. I hope this is an experiment. Do they not know that their strength lies in lush instrumentation and Brad R.'s amazing voice? Crash Test Dummies, you are not the Chili Peppers, nor are you the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Anyone can appreciate an artist trying new things, but this fails on too many levels. If you loved ""Ghosts"" and ""God"", you'll find but 1 or 2 songs listenable on this album. Please, Dummies, if you want dabble in trip-hop and still make memorable, indisposable music like you have in the past, at least throw on a Morcheeba CD before you try this again."
1,What happened? These guys used to be good!!,"These guys were my favorite band until they released their last album, which was still okay. Now, however it doesn't even sound like Brad is singing anymore. The only good song that the woman sings is on the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack. I am so happy that I did not buy this CD. This is one of those cd's that you buy and then wish you could return. I have supported this band from the beginning, which spans over eight years. I can't support music that isn't in anyway enlightening or worth listening to at least once."
1,So Sad to See a Love Affair End,I've loved CTD for their lyrics wrapped around a memorable tune. That's out with Keep A Lid On Things. The lyrics are there but you will not be able to remember a tune nor are you likely to want to. Who is this group and what have they done with CTD? How would you like REM to suddenly become the Squirrel Nut Zippers? I won't buy another CD for the rest of my life without a listen first.
2,Peeyoo.,"Imagine a corroboration between ""Kool & the Gang"" and Slim Whitman. This album has even less synergy and ear appeal."
1,Not the same music we have come to know and love...,"It's not the same thoughtful, philosophic, often happy-ending music with great sounds that I could listen to in front of my kids. I won't buy another Crash Test Dummies before listening. Hey gang--get back to your roots!"
1,Save your money!,"If you liked the last two Crash Test Dummies offerings, it's very likely you'll hate this one. What were they thinking? I'm getting mine to the used-CD shop ASAP to sell it, before the word gets out how bad it is!"
1,Don't make the mistake I did and buy this CD!,"When I heard the Dummies were coming out with a new CD, I was excited to say the least. I've been a fan since the God Shuffled His Feet days, The Ghosts That Haunt Me was awesome, and I loved A Worm's Life, as the Dummies took their trademark sound in a more lyrically whimsical direction. After having read others' reviews of this ""departure,"" I have little to add other to their well-placed criticism except for my two cents: this album is boring. I might even go so far as to call it worthless. The tunes are slower, far less intruiging, and all around a much lower quality than i have come to expect from a great band. I went out and bought it the week it was released, even after I heard ""Keep a Lid on THings"" on the radio (to the ridicule of my friends, to whom I snidely replied, 'I'm a loyal fan, and I know the Dummies won't let me down...'), but I'm sorry to say, the Dummies have let me down with this one."
2,Err...,"Looks like the Crash Test Dummies got lost in god's shuffle. With the exception of Keep a Lid on Things, the first nine songs are totally repetitive and forgettable. It's only on the second half of the album that the songs begin to make musical sense. Fittingly, these are also the songs that are reminiscent of earlier Dummies songs such as Aching To Sneeze and I Love Your Goo. Overall, kind of disappointing."
1,what happened on the way to the studio?,"i will make this short and to the point. i have been a CTD fan for years now and can honestly say that this is a terrible work that they have released. every element that makes the Dummies a great band who write great pop songs were completely ignored. if you are a new fan, then buy their first disc so you can properly judge the CTD's real talents."
2,Dropped the ball big-time...,"Man, what were CTD thinking when they recorded this? After the relative failure of their last album, AWL, they must've had a knee jerk reaction to their music. Big mistake. AWL was brilliant but under-marketed -- that's the label's fault. People won't buy an album in droves if they don't hear it on the radio. GYAH is just flat-out bad and doesn't deserve to make it on radio. Their first three albums were brilliant, varied works. This disc is just a complete let down, a total joke. I know they're Canadians, but damn...are they really this weird? Pass on this disc and pick up their first three..."
5,beautiful sparkly bracelet,Recently bought this. Its well made solid clasp and looks just like the picture. Its a heavier wider bracelet on the wrist and so it stands out. A good purchase.
4,10 minutes....Well! Don`t bet on it!,A very good UNIX tutorial. Covers yhe most basic 'need to know':s Excellent for Beginners
4,Very good for those jumping into Unix for the first time.,"This book is for those who need the ability to move around the Unix filesystem, edit text files, and perform simple commands such as copying, moving, and deleting files. It also gives a good review of Unix as a whole. I'm not sure if there is a Linux version of this book, if there is I would recommend it instead of this one. But most of the book is applicable to both Unix and Linux."
3,Not exactly clear,"I am not exactly sure what Edward Behr is trying to say in this biography of Emperor Hirohito. From my perception, he seem to be saying that Hirohito is gulity of war crimes but not responsible for them. I think I get the feeling that Behr himself may not be sure. One of the earlier reviews which compared Hirohito with ""Mr. Carlson from WKRP"" seem to be a very good analogy. I don't think Hirohito was that clueless but his influence wasn't all that great. I would recommended that new Pulitzer prize winning biography that came out several years ago. It has a more balance view on the man."
4,Mind Numbing,"I must start off by saying that when I first read this book I had very little knowledge of Hirohito or his involvement in WWII. However, after reading Behind the Myth, as well as learning a bit more, I now feel safe saying that the book is quite good, if not a little flawed. In all fairness the author was doing what was unheard of at the time the book was written, and that call just dead emperor of Japan a criminal of war. He made some rather broad generalizations and assumptions, but he managed to plant the seed of doubt in my mind. Granted, if you want to convince someone that Hirohito was guilty of starting the war, or that he should have even been tried, this book won't provide you with that information, however it is a good start. He won't convince you, but he will numb your mind and make it ready to accept the possibility."
3,Hirohito NOT a war criminal!!!,"I feel this is a good and educational book, yet I consider it somewhat flawed. The entire theme of the book is the author's contention that Hirohito is a war criminal, but after reading the book I feel that Hirohito is NOT a war criminal. It is amazing that the author spent 400 pages with the biased intent to convince the reader of Hirohito's war criminality, yet I felt the polar opposite after finishing the book.Basically what I took from the book was that Hirohito was a skinny, little man who was a powerless puppet of the pro-war military and political factions. Simply, Hirohito reminded me of the Mr. Carlson character on the sitcom, WKRP in Cincinnati, a clueless figurehead who simply sat back a let others run the show.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book and learned a great deal and I recommend it. I simply found that the author unwittingly disproved his initial contention by the time I finished the book."
5,I wish to comment on STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND,"Samuel R. Delany has been my favorite author for years, but only recently have I realized the brilliance of the ending of STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND. The book weaves an entangling matrix of love and desire amidst geopolitical and interplanetary intrigue. In the end the love interest is removed by the mysterious enemy, leaving the protagonist to ache. Indeed, it leaves the reader to ache for the promised sequel, THE SPLENDOR AND MISERY OF BODIES, OF CITIES, which has not come. Twelve years later this tactic by Delany has continued to haunt me in the same halls of my heart where my lost loves lie. Brilliant! Bravo to Delany for not writing the second book, for indeed, who is ever promised another day of love? If we live in the forever tomorrow, where is today? Bravo! --- D.F. Huettner"
1,bait and switch,"I purchased this video because it claimed to contain ""Der Fuehrer's Face."" In fact, one gets a bunch of talking heads chattering about the cartoons of the Second War without seeing any cartoons in their entirety. It's hard not to conclude that the blurb accompanying the video is intentionally designed to mislead consumers by claiming to offer classic animated features in their entirety. Save your money."
2,dissapointed,"i agree with the others. too much talk and too little cartoons. it is still interesting but i bought the video expecting mostly cartoons. oh well, you win some you lose some!"
5,This is the one to get,"While other online reviewers may resent the combined marketing of the Cole/Noel album, I consider it the definitive Short release. I, too, prefer the Porter -- one of my desert island albums certainly -- but the mix of the Masters is irresistible. Short's treatment of the two is separate, distinctive and varied; each style is respected. But so much sophisticated music from the master of sophisticated delivery (both vocal and instrumental) deserves gratitude rather than quibbling."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,LOVE THIS PRODUCT! CAN'T FIND IT ANYMORE. IF SOMEONE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND IT OR ORDER IT PLEASE SEND ME THE WEBSITE.
5,Worn it for years!,"This stuff is amazing. . .it doesn't look like glitter, just a nice sheen. I wear it pretty much every day in the summer, love it!"
1,Very disappointing,"I don't understand why most of the reviews of this book have been positive. I found it boring and couldn't finish it. The writing is lazy and sloppy and shows all the signs of an author who is cranking them out or rushing to meet a deadline. The conversations are dull, lacking in wit and imagination. The characters are totally unappealing. I bought the book thinking that it would have a nice atmosphere -- an aura of mystery and ancient Ireland. But the author is writing too fast and too carelessly to stir up any atmosphere. This book is a waste of time and money."
3,Master of Souls,"This started out to be a promising read, and fairly quickly disintegrated into boredom about the story and apathy toward the characters. Guess I'm just not into page after page of involved history and name dropping."
3,the pressure of touring,"Souls of Black was doomed.Topping Practice What You Preach would have required months of work and great, band-wide inspiration.I'm sure there is a more complete story out on the interweb, but the basic story here is that Testament wanted to tour with Monsters of Rock, but their label support them for it without a new album top promote. Under a TIGHT deadline (i think it was less then 6 months, but it could be even less), the band threw together this album, which has some great moments, but lacks any real greatness, particularly in the normally brilliant solos. I recall interviews with the band after the Ritual came out where everyone admitted to the lack of inspiration being a result of having no time to really explore the songs. Sadly, there are some foundations for great songs here."
4,"Good, but too rushed.","After three excellent releases Testament brings us Souls of Black.Probably my favorite album cover from Testament.Oh yeah, the music.I remember when this came out. I was quite surprised that it came out so soon after Practice What You Preach.And it shows.Yes, the disc is awesome. Everything I came to love from Testament.But it had a rushed feeling to it. It basically copied the formula from Practice but didn't do anything to advance their status as a thrash pioneer.If they had taken another year to really work on this album it would have solidified Testament's place in the top tier of thrash bands.Sadly it all goes down hill after this release.Still, Souls of Black is a must have for and metal head. No collection is complete without it."
3,"I love this Band, but not this CD","Testament is one of my favorite bands, and has been since 1990. This is not their best work, in fact, it may be their worst. The album starts off ok, particularly Face in the Sky, and Souls of Black, but after that it mostly feels like filler. It is not nearly as powerful of a work as Practice What You Preach, or The New Order, or even The Legacy. The guitar work of Alex Skolnick is good as always, and the vocals of Chuck deliver, but many of the songs feel rushed, like they would not have made most of the other Testament Albums. If you are going to buy one Testament CD, make it either The New Order, or their new one, The Formation of Damnation, or maybe the Gathering. If you buy this one, and it is the criteria you judge them upon, you may end up liking this band less than they deserve."
3,a could have been great cd went south by rushing it and poor production!,this cd was very rushed for the fact of wanting to get on the clash of the titans tour in 90 and for some damn reason this cd was recorded badly and have awful production.this song could have been great but they just fall flat(I'v heard them live at the time and they are very good heavier than on cd)this cd was to put them up with the top 4 thrash bands but stalled them even after clash of the titans and opening for slayer.
5,Great Testament CD,"Testament is one of my favorite band (although I'm not too keen on their new stuff they have put out). All of their cd's up through ""Low"" is great. This is great thrash metal and I STRONGLY suggest their best cd (and my favorite cd of all time) 1989's ""Practice What You Preach."" If you like older style thrash metal, you CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THAT CD."
3,Good,"Some of the songs on here are filler material, but ""The Legacy"" is definatly not. Some songs will have me thrashing around, but others will have me dashing for the ""skip"" button."
2,Skip this one.,"Testament is one of my favorite bands, but I found this album to be a disappointment. This music is practically easy listening compared to the incredible ""The New Order"". Unfortunately, Testament just sound uninspired here. Get The New Order instead."
1,this cd [stinks],"apart from the album cover {which i must admit is really cool}and the song face in the sky {the only decent song on this album,still nothing great}there is no real reason to buy this poor excuse of a metal album.the singer is truly terrible,the worst metal vocalist i ever heard.he's voice is so bad it is almost comical.imagine i actually spent two dollars on this cd at a used cd store.it's not even worth 1 cent.easily the worst cd i ever heard."
4,Great Movie!,"I watched this ""Dear America"" movie.It has great acting and everthing seems so real.I only wish it were longer!But I really like it still."
5,Interesting metaphysical book,"This book is similar to some Edgar Cayce material and gives a broader perspective of our world and universe, along with the other books in the series."
5,Awesome!,"Absolutely mind-bending and expanding information. Kudos to Dolores Cannon for the wonderful information she has given to all of us in her many books (I've read them all). If you really want to step out into the universe and open your heart, read this."
4,What an awesome bag!!,"So, I get stuck plowing (in my driveway of all places) and my friend breaks my 2"" strap. That won't happen again.I just opened the box, and I thought I was getting a basic heavy duty bag to store my recovery tools in. Nope.Two outside pockets for gloves, shackles, etc., an inside pocket for a sheave, and the large pocket has a velcro attached inner liner to hold water, snow, mud and make it easy to clean. I am VERY impressed for the money.It would have five stars if there was a handle on the cover in addition to the shoulder strap."
2,Exploitive? How about BORING?!!,"Why do people even bother making women-in-prison films when they don't understand what their audience is looking for? I mean, nobody REALLY wants to see the serious side of what goes on behind bars --- it's mostly dull and uninteresting, right? So when I rented this video, I expected the fun stuff --- the mean, bitchy guards and their cold, dykey warden, preying on their pretty little helpless female prisoners. This should include at least two or three shower scenes, and at least one nocturnal visit between barely clad cellmates! But this movie had NONE OF THIS! It was a poorly-scripted soap-opera, with a totally forgettable script. Note to director: Next time, stick to life on the outside!"
5,A hilarious spoof on women prison flicks.,"This little gem is so campy you have to love it. Anne Heche is very funny as the ""queen of mean"" and all the actors do a terrific job. It is a very funny spoof of all those serious women- behind-bars movies (not to mention one of the most popular Charlie's Angels episodes), but this one is made just for laughs and it works!"
1,girls in prison,"I'm a fan of Anne Heche, but found this film weak and poorly done. Seemed to be a Roger Corman type film."
3,COULD I HAVE A LITTLE CHEESE WITH THAT PLEASE?,"A slightly campy and cheesy made for Showtime movie that takes place in the 1950's when mostly white women went to prison. We initially see two women kill men and go to prison. One (Bahni Turpin as Melba) used a hammer on a right wing news caster, and the other (Ione Skye as Carol Madison) was able to kill a man with a single blow to the head with a beer bottle. A third girl (Melissa Lahlitah Crider as Aggie) who goes to prison. She was framed and while it is a mystery as to who framed her and why, it is easy to figure out due to the lack of multiple suspects and only one motive.The film includes the token prison doctor's exam, shower scene, fire hose, lesbians kissing, cat fight/riot, noir detective, and a really bad script.Shower nudity (Ann Heche plus others)"
2,Ohhhh My.. :(,"Not too much to be said in a redeeming factor here. I think Ann Heche is a fabulous actor. I think shes even more cuter now, that she's 5 months pregnant..:)However this movie, was a waste of my time and money. It had one or two shower scenes that lasted a few minutes. It had NO mean bully guards, that did awful things to the woman at night. Has prison reform really been this good.??Listen rent it if your fan of Ann as I am, but save your money on buying it."
3,Saucy sexy thriller,A standard murder plot takes on a new sweaty and sexy setting in this film starring the lusty lesbian Anne Heche. I recommend this film to anyone lonely on a Saturday night. Its not only for guys either. Women can fantasize too.
1,Waste of Money,"I was looking for a book as a pick me upper for a child. This books fails to mention the most famous inspirational left handers including world leaders, heroes, scientists. Instead they list people like Jack the Ripper, Hitler, to name a few...COME ON. Don't waste your money, not interesting, not funny, poorly written."
4,An interesting story,"This was an interesting story that focused on what happened to the person after Sam leaps out. It did drag a little, but it was neat to see how Ann Marie responded to her new life."
2,Did not hold my interest,I must say that Foreknowledge was boring and did not hold my interest into wanting to keep reading the story. The story line was good but could have been better if it were written differently.
2,Kirk Alyn flies for the last time,"This 1952 serial adventure stars Kirk Alyn (famous as Superman of the serials) as the head of a flying squadron. The bad news is that there is surprisingly little airborne footage in this, and nothing much happens for several chapters. The good news is that the serial wakes up later on, with plenty of action and well-staged stunt work by David Sharpe. And for those who enjoy the peculiar lapses of logic found only in Columbia serials, there are a few uninentional laughs (two pilots bail out of an airplane and shut the door BEHIND them). This video will appeal most to fans of Kirk Alyn and to kids."
1,BLACKHAWK,"Loved the old comic book hero, hated the serial. It was like two hours in a dentist chair having a root canal. I approached this dub with high expectations. They were dashed. Kirk Allyn was wooden in the major role as the leader of this strange group on Polish American flyers. The plot was dumb, even for a serial. Save your money. If you like flying serials try THE SHADOW OF THE EAGLE or ACE DRUMMOND."
2,Rick Vallin,"As I saw Rick Vallin tonight Dec 30, 2003 in The Quick Gun with Audie Murphy, I remembered seeing Rick way back in the Blackhawk Serial over 50 years ago when I was 12."
1,Utter nonsense,"For a book to be labeled a ""mystery,"" shouldn't there be some sort of mystery that needs to be solved? Even if it's just some guy in a mask scaring kids away from a lake to look for gold? Not to mention that the ease with which the ""spy"" goes about her business would make James Bond look inept. This book is sorely lacking in suspense, drama, mystery, romance, or credibility. It makes me wonder if the target audience is supposed to be adults or the young adult audience the previous series is supposedly aimed at."
4,Nice boots,"The boots are nice, slightly different than i expected but nothing major. Boots run a little big though, you may want to go a size smaller!"
3,Can't Decide,"The woman in me likes that whole caveman style of a dominant male that takes what he wants. But the modern female in me is disgusted by the forcible marriage, public consumation, constant groping by multiple men, and the inability to ever leave. i gave it three stars because in the end it was sexy, pretty sexy."
2,Might be ur cup of tea if..... but for me it was too disturbing to finish...,Look i like to keep an open mind on things especially erotic novels and I have enjoyed Ms. Black's work in the past but this was a bit too disturbing for meNow IF you like forced sex or forced sexual situations and IF you enjoy forced humiliation -- then this might be a book for you.I like to go with the flow and see how things play out generally in a book. This book was good at first keeping the reader on their toes with the suspense and I kept reading through some of the forced sexual situations myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable however it got to the point that I felt too uncomfortable and just couldn't relate enough to the female lead to continue going. I recognize the fact that I really don't like degradation of females and in this story it just kept sinking worse and worse into more awful and horrifically degrading scenes. I got more then half way through and then threw in the towel. Hope this helps!
2,Very boring!,"I hate to admit that this book was very boring! I keep it bc I collect Jaid Black, but JW Mckenna reeks! I would not buy anything else by that person. Boring boring boring!"
2,Not everything boils down to seratonin,"Dr. Pawlak adds basic info on brain structure and hormones, exercise, blah blah blah. It probably is very helpful for a slice of the population, but just like ANY program, it is not the answer for all, despite what she says. I found her writing to be very critical and arrogant. She completely dismisses other bodies of data, insisting her way is the only way, and yet doesn't even mention issues such as food allergies or their impact on weight. She also over-complicates the topic of weight, making it more psychological, about addiction - as though the brain and seratonin levels are completely at fault. I would only recommend this if I thought someone needed to read about the relationship between eating and seratonin, or if they maybe needed kindling and ran out of twigs and newspaper. Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers, she has everything double-spaced and stretched out with ""extra paragraphs"" so it easily takes up four times as much space."
5,Nice Sandals,I am happy with my purchase. It fits perfectly and looks very nice wearing it. Good for special evening occassions.
4,Where you shop can make a difference,"As I read this little book, I became far more aware of the companies and brands that are not stewards of the environment or ethical behavior. I hope those companies read this book and find themselves motivated to be more responsible."
3,"Great idea, short on content","A fabulous concept, gives some lowdown on MAJOR name brands and companies, but really lacks most of the brands and companies I typically shop. Although it does give a website to visit to find more reviews, I don't carry an internet connection in my pocket, although I'm sure a lot of people do. Also some of the content seems almost contradictory... such as listing Burt's Bees as an A- brand for ""body care"" even though it is owned by Clorox, which is rated as an F, and tagged as a corporate villain. This would be a great gift for someone JUST entering the ""green"" mindset."
3,Not as comprehensive as I hoped,"I devoured the Better World Handbook and purchased the Better World Shopper without thinking twice about it. While I knew it was compact (for portability's sake) I am a bit disappointed that there is no additional information on each company reviewed. I was under the impression you could go to the website and see more of the authors research to make better informed decisions. For example, exactly does Morningstar Farms receive such a bad grade? The reader is not informed of the details, the author simply ""graded"" the company based on his (admittedly thorough) scale and the reader is supposed to trust it's accuracy. Other than that, this is very helpful. If you do not want to know details, this is the book for you."
4,Excellent Awareness....,Really enjoy reading through the book. This makes you more aware of your surroundings and cautious about who you purchase from. Never hurts to educate yourself on who is doing good for people and the environment.
5,Great book!,This is a great book to help people buy the most productive products. It is small enough to carry with you while shopping.
5,Great Reference Book,Great pocket reference book for the conscientious shopper! I keep it in my purse or vehicle so I always have it handy.
5,Very helpful book!,"I recently bought this book after seeing a coworker with it recently and ordered it as soon as I came home. Since it is a pocket guide there aren't a lot of explanations on why companies receive certain ratings, but I actually like that because I can get on the website and do my own research and really learn and understand how to use the book. Great references and great time and effort but into making a little book to make our everyday ""voice"" heard. Definitely going to be given to a lot of friends over the holidays :)"
5,Contemporary folk/rock at its best!,"I discovered the Bacon Brothers recently, through their debut album FOROSOCO. Having immensely enjoyed that particular record, I was slightly disappointed--at first--by the sleeker production of WHITE KNUCKLES. After a while, though--say, when ""Unhappy Birthday"" kicks into overdrive--I realized that change isn't always a bad thing...in fact, sometimes it's pretty darn good.This is an album that will make you think. Whether it's the bitter irony of ""What Am I Gonna Do Now,"" ""Good News,"" and ""Playboy,"" or the healing of ""Unhappy Birthday,"" or the heartbreak of ""Tuesday"" and ""Hasn't Got a Heart,"" or the yearning of ""Get Away With It"" and ""Peace Dance,"" or...hell, you get the idea. WHITE KNUCKLES is a stellar record by two talented musicians--Kevin and Michael Bacon have forged some great records and some incredible songs, and this album stands as testimony that there is still hope out there for rock 'n roll."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","Anyone who thinks this CD is worth the 17 dollars is im sorry, out of their mind. Why not spend that money on a real band or 3 shots of pain from your local bartender, all would be better than listening to this CD. The only reason this band sells CDs is because of Kevin Bacon and do not tell me anything different especially at the same price if not higher than other well established bands."
2,Orly not really no bite,"arrived in great packaging, earlier than expected.the cap is in rubber, really easy to open and close.nonetheless, the product presents a slightly bitter taste,it does not really prevents biting.and washing hands washes the bitterness away.quite disappointed, it is not really helping avoiding this bad habit."
2,Periplus India Travel map,the actual map of the country ( big picture ) is about half of the unfolded paper. Of that half showing the country about 70% is other countries and water. The rest is street maps of a few cities.It is a very poor map of India in my opinion-not enough important locations listed- buy another brand.
3,This is NOT a book!,"Don't order this if you need the TEXTBOOK. Amazon needs to be clearer about which items are books and which are software. This is software ONLY. Since I needed book and software, now I have to return the software and scramble to get them before class starts in 2 days! Got the item within 2 days though...:)"
5,Gripping WWII novel,"The author's background as a geophysicist shines through his gripping storytelling in this thrilling historical drama spanning several generations of people across the world. An renegade submarine in WWII-era Japan is readdressed years later, and the discovery changes the lives of several people, forcing them to reassess what they believe and who they believe themselves to be. Alidade's characterization is strong and his storytelling even stronger as the reader is led through the twists and turns of this novel. Captivating from the first page to the last, this book is a page-turner in the truest sense of the word."
2,Everyone else must have gotten a different book,"I'm not sure what everyone else was talking about, but I thought this book was ho-hum at best. The characters were only shallowly portrayed, and the author took what could have been a compelling story and failed to tell it. You know when someone says that the movie just didn't do the book justice because it left so much out? That's how I felt reading this book. There just seemed to be so much left out.I am truly disappointed by Roof of Hell, and equally mystified that I seem to be the only one who felt this way."
1,Less than ho hum,"Wow, I used to trust the reviews on Amazon. Now I'm going to be much more careful. This book is substandard by any measurement and a complete waste of time. I guess it's possible to buy reviews or have a lot of good friends. More likely the publisher makes his staff write positive reviews. This is a setup.On the plus side I'm sure that if you have an eleventh grade education you might find it interesting to learn that there was a World War II and we had to kill a lot of Japonese and that it happened sometime around when your grandfather was alive and crab fishermen in Alaska were just starting out to be TV stars. How could anybody claim this book is historically accurate, it is completely historically ambigious. It reads like the author doesn't even have Google to do his research and even worst it is a complete failure as a romance novel.It has a great title but it is a fiction killer."
2,There are much better books out there,"Some chapters are fairly well written and keep your attention but the majority of the book is somewhat boring and predictable. The author makes an attempt of foreshadowing but doesn't do much with it. I am still confused why the Japanese and American babies were mentioned as much as they were and in the end the author did virtually nothing with them. He attempted to introduce romance in the novel but the romantic references were appropriate for even a 2nd grader to read...not much passion there! The ending left many unanswered questions regarding the treasure, the romance and the future of the main characters. I honestly cannot believe that the average rating for this book is 5 stars because there are much better books out there."
3,Awesome read,"This gut wrenching page turner will leave you begging for more.The book is a very easy read. The story hooks the reader from the first page. You immediately get the idea of what is going on, without having to wait until your 3 chapters in before the story takes off. The Japenese flavor makes the story very interesting and gives a perspective that is not often seen in most story lines.The story romances your imagination as if you were reading a childhood fantasy. Yet it has the action and depth of an adult thriller. You feel as though you are learning something without being taught. This story is very exciting and leaves you eagerly awaiting a sequal."
3,"been there, heard that","If you've done any significant reading on James Cameron through magazine articles or seen him speak in interviews, you've already gotten most of what you'll get out of this book. It covers more personal background, and gives more detail on the early work (Pirahna II) than is usually discussed, but there is far too much Cameron worshipping in this book and not enough thorough details."
2,Not worth the price,"For those who have become fans of Cameron because of Titanic, this book might be a pleasant introduction to this filmmaker. But to others who have read Cameron interviews/stories in magazines like Premiere, Esquire, Movieline, etc...this book is an outright bore. None of the information is new and the quotes are all ripped from past interviews. This book is on par with the Leo DiCaprio books that litter the Times Best Seller list right now, which isn't saying much."
3,An unauthorized book on Jim Cameron,"I have to agree with the comment by SVK, it may not be worth buying if you've read too much of all sources Chris derived to use for his so-called ""unauthorized"" book. Other than that, it's more interesting to learn more about the man who blew the audiences away and held Hollywood hostage at his feet. Paula Parisi's book would be a safe bet to satisfy your appetite for knowledge of the wildly successful and most recognized filmmaking genuis since Spielberg."
3,can't wait for the next one,"I bought this album because of the incredible vocals and awesome guitar playing on Rubberneck. The only song that reminds me of Possum Kingdom, Away, and Tyler is You'll Come Down. That, combined with the cool newer sounding riffs in Sweetness and Little Sin make the album worth buying. I miss Darrell Herbert's single string riffs and extreme whammy bar though. The album doesn't rate anywhere as good as rubberneck to me. But hopefully the Toadies will keep releasing new stuff because they have a much better sound than today's mainstream b.s."
4,Great follow up,Well I liked Rubberneck so much and decided to buy a ticket to see their second night at Stubb's here in Austin whihc was last night. I was real curious to hear this album and this one I thought was also very excellent. Maybe even better then Rubberneck. The album starts off with tradition Toadies guitar riff and goes right into a blast of rocdk with Plane Crash. It keeps rocking from there. Other favorites include Little Sin which is another energeting rocker. My personal favorite would probably be Motivational which is full of energy. Not much else I can say about this album but out of the first two this is probably my favorite album. My advice if you don't have this album get it but as I know alot of Toadies fans are obesesed and own everything. As far as the concert went last night it was ok but didn't care too much for the new stuff they were playing from No Deliverence.
3,Return From the Water,"Hadn't listened to the Toadies in years, then stumbled upon this album. SWEET!!! The Toadies rock, no doubt about it. This ain't ""Rubberneck"", but it's suprisingly good. The Toadies retain their trademark sound, and have put out a good album here.""Push the Hand"", ""Heel"", ""You'll Come Down"", all classic Toadies style. Forgot how funky their bass can be. Great find here, so happy I picked it up."
4,"Great CD, but what took so long?",First of all this CD is real rock. Not like that pop stuff that seems to have taken over all the airwaves lately.Too bad it didn't come out five years ago...The only real gripe I have is that it isn't even close to being as good as their previous CD Rubberneck... which in my opinion is one of the best albums ever made...Still worth checking out though.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because I love Rubberneck and because reviewers seemed to agree that this was album more of the same. I was disappointed, though, and would say that there are only 3 songs worth listening to on this album. The song writing seemed stale and lacked the creativity of Rubberneck. I listened to it and thought to myself - Well, I guess this is why the band the band broke up."
4,Good,"The item ordered was shipped promptly and at a very good price. The CD was in good condition, and I am very pleased with my experience."
5,The Toadies?,"This band has gotten very little respect by the mainstream music industry......however this is going to change very quickly. This cd will/should be considered for album of the year......songs like Motivational, You'll come down, What we have we steal, and Jigsaw Girl are just a few of the powerpacked tracks that make this cd a must buy. Do yourself a favor and purchased this cd now!And to......Todd, Mark, Lisa, and Clark.....thanks for hanging in!"
2,Not as good as the first.,"I loved their album ""Rubberneck"". I saw them in concert in the late 1990's and they were awesome. Years went by with no other news about the Toadies, and for a moment I thought they had broken up. Then I bought this album and was very disapointed. Maybe my expectations were high, but I was hoping to be floored with more original sounds and songs, and instead felt like I bought a run-on sentance of a song. I found nothing original nor did anything stand out to me. Their music is still good as well as their voices, but I felt the album was overall weak. Maybe the next one will be better."
2,Weak and Contrived,"I have really tried to like this album, but unlike Rubberneck, it seems forced, insincere, and even exploitive. The songs are semi-passable for the now ubiquitous alternative radio fodder, but they are punctuated by long stretches of overdone bombast married to sensationalized drivel. (check out jigsaw girl and the title track for good examples) In the end I was left feeling that the Toadies were trying to create a driven and haunting album of Possum Kingdom knock-offs, and much like Neruda's fisherman manage only to catch themselves."
3,It's not close to Rubberneck....,"The lead vocals are lacking on this album, and most compose of extremely repetitive chorus' but the album is still good, it's just no where as good as Rubberneck."
4,Funny and Scary,"I found it to be an enjoyable movie. Not groundbreaking or mindblowing but it thrilled me. I enjoy Corin Nemec a lot and wish he was featured more than he was. However, Quentin is a fun character and well acted. Charisma is equally as fun to watch. The spoof of 'reality tv shows that want to suck in more viewers by playing on the supernatural' is great! I jumped out of my seat a few times. I wish this had come out around Halloween but I'm sure it will make it onto SyFy's menu soon enough. Enjoy!"
4,SiFi Fan will like this,"OK, so the movie is not over the top great. But I like horror movies that give you a history about what is happening in the movie. This one was produced for TV so no gore here. I am a ScFi channel fan and I enjoyed this feature when it aired. Horror/ScFi fans will love this."
2,It only ok,"I order this to fit a 3.5"" drive in a 5.25"" slot, it worked as stated but the screw holes were a bit off in size and I had to force them in. It worked but I would pay a bit more for a better product next time"
5,not as pictured,"There's not much to review. The piece fits perfectly and comes with screws for the hard drive. However, the metal is not the same color as in this picture. It has a flat gray finish."
3,Beware: Works poorly with some tool-less bays,"I've been using these for years, and there's nothing wrong with them, so long as you are using them in traditional 5.25"" bays in which you screw the device in. However, I've tried them with a couple of newer cases with tool-less 525"" bays and they don't work well, if at all. They kind of work, but the drives are a bit loose and that's not good for a hard drive.This isn't really the fault of this device, and they may work fine with some tool-less bays, but they don't work with Corsair bays well at all."
4,Solid construction & design,"Arrived as advertised, fairly solid construction, slots for screws appropriately placed, fit easily into my tower case and held my HDD solidly in place. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because 1) it seems a bit pricey for two small stamped metal pieces and a few screws and 2) access hole for screwdriver (large oval openings visible in picture) when attaching bracket to the side of the HDD would have been more convenient if it was just a bit larger. Maybe just a low volume item makes it a bit pricey."
3,hard drive brackets,"replaced a tape drive with a hard disk in a desktop/tower. needed to drill some extra holes, but this did the trick quite nicely. now I have another 500 GB drive where a useless tape backup used to be on the other IDE channel."
5,extraordinarily beautiful bassooning!,"Pascal Gallois has delivered another amazing CD with his disc titled ""Voyages"". The Hosokawa and Schoeller works are fascinating to listen to, and use the bassoon in ways no others have. The highlight of this disc, however, is the Berio. Mr. Gallois recorded this masterpiece several years ago for Deutsche Gramaphone; a recording still available and very worth hearing! In this new recording of Berio, we hear a performance that is much more smooth and expressive. Gallois has now lived with this score for years and has given many live performances of it. This long experience has deepened his interpretation, and led him to highlight the works beauties with great clarity. This CD is a must-have for anyone interested in the music of Berio, and for those who want to experience the state-of-the-art of bassoon playing today."
5,Awesome product!,"For people that love macro photography, this item is a must. Great definition, detail and sharp image is the result you are gonna get with this lens. Being able to play with dimension by focusing in part of the element or object and having the background out of focus, it's super! If you are undecided, go for it! I can guarantee professional results."
4,"Beautiful,Beautiful doll, wrong info","You see, I am from India and the doll is NOT wearing a sari. A sari is a long piece of fabric wrapped around a girl, and then the girls wear a skirt under the sari. She is wearing a ""Lunga"" A 2 piece dress. And they called the ornament on her head a bindi. It is NOT a bindi. Bindis are decorated and have adhesive on the back. Basically pretty stickers.However, the doll is extremly beautiful, and she is a great collectible for myself. I sometimes play with her.Please try to understand. I am not trying to go Against Mattel (the company) at all. They just should have done a little more research."
2,Delonghi Alicia Machine,"Hard to clean, coffee grounds in coffee and frequently in metal bottom container after brewing, aluminum coffee grounds holder and top very cheap and was bent on first brewing. Had 2 Krupps makers in the past, they were far superior."
4,Perfect Solution!,"After reading many reviews and options I decided to order the Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka Espresso Coffee Maker. I will be using this item at work with limited space so I am thrilled to have a space saving, easy to clean coffee maker that will make a good cup of coffee. I have the option to make a smaller amount or to brew enough to share. First use made a great tasting cup of coffee. I will make sure to grab the metal portion to tighten or take apart for cleaning. Don't use the handle to turn the pot loose from the base. The plastic does look like it could crack if strained, dropped or misused. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase!!! I will only update if this changes."
4,Fast easy and effective,It has all what other higher priced units have. So why not Delonghi? The result now depends on the coffee you use...
5,my opinion,I am completely satisfied and this is all what I wanted. Design is great! Bur I would made it more reliable but it is okay.
4,Fantastic Espresso Maker at a Fraction of Cost,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5F0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe traditional stove top espresso maker with a twist! While living in Morocco, I used the non-electric version of the espresso maker for years and have not been able to duplicate the flavor since I have been back in the States. The DeLonghi Alicia has taken me back to the smells and flavors of a country that I served and absolutely adore without the hassle of standing over a stove. A more convenient product, I could not imagine."
4,Very Happy,"I now have 2 of these, one for home and one for work. They work great and produce some amazing coffee. the espresso does not quite have exactly the same quality ""crema"" as the huge expensive machines, but hey look how much money it costs! it makes the coffee more enjoyable to me knowing that i didn't pay $700 for a machine. I do have to watch this one, to make sure the heating element doesn't stay on too long with a dry chamber, and i am also very careful not to put too much pressure on the plastic pieces when screwing and unscrewing the top, but overall I am very satisfied, i hope they last a long time."
1,Help where do I buy the coffee,Recently bought this Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka maker 6 cup for a xmas present have spent three weeks trying to buy the coffee pads that go in it in th eu.k. would be really grateful if somebody could help me with this problemRegardsJean
4,Perfect for the office,"I have a Bialetti stovetop pot at home, but I can't always make my peppermint mocha on the way out the door, so my mother bought this item for me for Christmas. I keep it at my office, along with milk, Illy Moka ground coffee, and some syrup. I can make my mocha in about 7 or 8 minutes, although it's a giveaway when the smell wafts down the hall and people notice it. Still, very handy, and I like that the coffee sits in a plastic cup at the top instead of in the aluminum. I guess the water boils in the aluminum bottom, which isn't ideal, but I still love the unit."
4,"Good, not too expensive way to have espresso","We've been using it for about a month now. We took it on a 10-day trip to Florida to be able to make our coffee in the morning (I am Italian). It woks very well, the only shortcoming is the funnel, since the holes are a bit large for fine ground coffee, but it is a standard size, so it can be replaced with a better one. I use Bustelo coffee, up to now no complaints."
5,MOST USEFUL,"Best tasting coffee and best solution to have my coffee ready in two minutes.I bought 4 of these useful, practical and very easy to use coffee makers.I am using for myself and as gifts. Thank you."
3,Okay for price,"Okay for price. Dislikes are the clear container is plastic, coffee does not have top, and only produces 3 espresso cups. Likes are auto shutoff, electric, and can take on the go."
4,Excellent espresso maker,"Great product to replace my stovetop espresso maker. With this one, you don't have to stand next to the maker (lest your coffer boils over, as it did many times for me with my old maker). Of course this isn't a $400 espresso machine but does make a descent late."
4,Love it!,"Very nice, makes great espresso type drink using a realtively easy process with no need to purchase special coffee! However, a recent splurge on Kona Peabody proved to be especially delightful when brewed in the Alicia Moka Espresso Coffee Maker."
4,FAST AND EASY,"THIS LITTLE BEAUTY HAS THE""SPEED YA'NEED"" FOR THAT QUICK CUP OF ESPRESSO. OK SO IT DOESN'T GIVE THE FROTHY HEAD MANY OF US LIKE BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE UP HALF YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER SPACE EITHER! A NEAT COMPACT ITEM."
2,Nice idea but poorly manufactured,"I had the same problem as Balou--the upper chamber cracked and leaks coffee. It was a design flaw that I worried about from the beginning but decided to give it a chance nonetheless. I was a little better off in that mine made it a year and two weeks before doing so. Of course, the warranty is good for a year...The product doesn't get one star because I did like the ability to make coffee in my office without a burner. I also liked the ability to remove the coffee maker from the power base and leave the cord behind. My recommendation, though, is to wait until a company with better engineering skills offers a product."
3,Okay I guess,"it makes drinkable coffee, personally I think it comes out more bitter and less flavorful than similarly designed stovetop coffee makers. I definitely prefer this maker over my old drip coffeemaker, but I prefer keurig cup coffee more than this one. Sadly, that last option is rather expensive."
4,excelente!!!,"Almost as good as my stovetop pot, ""Alicia"" came through beautifully every morning away from home. It was a big hit with other vacationers and hotel staff as well; so much so that I left it behind for them. A gem!"
3,works ... so far.,"i only have this for a couple of months now and i had some trouble with the ON button getting stuck. also the little circular alumimum filter inside keeps getting bent. but so far, it is still making coffee everyday. my previous coffee maker was unknown brand from crate and barrel and lasted 4 years, so i'm hoping this will last as long or longer."
2,Delonghi Espresso Coffee Maker does the job well but...,"Unfortunately I have to change my mind... what I said in my original review was true for about six months, after that the part that holds the grounds started cracking and little holes appeared. The coffee was not as good and eventually I stopped using it and went back to my stove top Alessi which is still the best I ever had. So, if you want it for the short term, ok... just don't have any long term expectations.It does the job well, the coffee is hot and tasty, it is easy to clean but the looks can be improved. I am used to the italian coffee makers which are stylish so when I first received Delonghi I wanted to send it back - it looks cheap and honestly, homely... but after trying it I really like it... I recommend!"
2,I do not recommend it for espresso lover,1- some leak coming out of the maker 2- it will make dusty coffee 3- making low temperature coffee .4- it need more amount of grounded coffee to make one cup of espresso (in comparison to my Kupus esspress maker ) .5-the holes of the espresso filter is wider than that in the regular espresso maker( this maker it hard to find the prober grounded coffee for this maker)
1,Not happy,The plug was foriegn so had to buy an adapter then after 2 cups of coffee it wouldnt work : ( I was so excited too have to return it .
2,Not worth it...,I've to say I was do disappointed about this item. I tried at least 5 times and every time the coffee was not so clean and mess and smelt wired... It's not even close to what espresso taste like. Don't waste your money on that.
4,electric expresso maker,"I love this the fact that it keeps coffee warm for 30 mins, I bought 2 more for christmas gifts. the only thing that I wish it was bigger this is a great gift we are big expresso drinkers. everbody i gifted this item to loved it."
3,"I love this machine, but the plastic carafe cracks","I love this machine, it makes great espresso and is easy to handle. The only problem is that I have experienced the same problem many others have experienced...the plastic carafe cracks from the heat and eventually falls apart. The replacement carafe is $30 and that bugs me to have to pay for a defective part like this."
5,"Easy, Safe, Nummy Espresso, AND HERE'S A CLEANING TIP!","I'm forgetful. After many times of putting our stovetop moka-maker on the flame, walking away, and forgetting about it . . . my clever husband got me this electric one for Christmas. We had our first one for 3 years. Loved the easy mechanics, loved the espresso, used it almost every day. I recently had to replace it, only because I left the original at a hotel (forgetful, as I said) and it wasn't worth the expense and trouble of getting it back. So I look forward to years in partnership with the new one.The only problem had been trying to get rid of the stubborn espresso stains that developed in the plastic chamber over time. But I just learned of an EASY SOLUTION. Simply wipe with a MR. CLEAN MAGIC ERASER SPONGE. Voilla! No more stains, no scratches. Just wanted to pass on the tip. Now, gotta get back to drinking my espresso . . . ."
3,Was happy at first,Initially I was very satisfied with this brewer. The only down falls was if you needed to make large batches the base was hot. That wasn't a big deal though. Now several months later the brewer burns the coffee. I can no longer set it and walk away. I have to watch it and then its a fine line between not brewed enough and burnt. I am very unhappy and will try to get a replacement but I may be just looking for another brewer.
2,Poor quality,"The coffeemaker appears to be very cheaply made, and I was alarmed by the direction to make a few batches of ""throw-away"" coffee before the coffee becomes drinkable - maybe there is residual machine oil? We wound up just buying a simpler, higher quality stovetop Bialetti which makes very good coffee."
3,Accessory kit,Great idea because I had one of the coffee funnels wear out on me and the unit is no good without that part. The negative thing about this kit is the useless milk frother included. Not necessary and I view it as filler to up the price.
1,Broke after one month,"I purchased this coffee maker in early September and now only in late October did it break. The switch inexplicably no longer stays in the ""on"" position, rendering the entire product useless. I loved this machine while it worked, but it appears to be very cheaply made. The fact that it broke after only a few weeks means that I can't give it more than one star."
2,it was ok,"Ce-Ce Peniston was looking good&I was digging the vibe. the cat she married in the Film reminded me alot of Ronald ""Mr.Biggs"" Isley. I was waiting for Bro Man to start singing.this film flip flopped between the christian vibe&the sensual vibe.this film was a trip.Ce-Ce is still crazy stuffed&I likes it.but ain't alot of acting there,but oh well.this film was just ok with a couple of funny parts."
3,Just ok!,"Cee Cee was looking fabulous throughout the entire movie but her acting and singing in it was not that great. I actually bought it to support her but if I had to compare her acting to the ones of everyone else in the film, she would only at that time get an A+ rating. Still she sings so aweful in this movie. It should not even really be on sale for anymore than 1.00. Sorry. The other critiques here will tell you more about the film in its' entirety. I can't put myself through anymore of even writing about it."
5,"Not just a CD, the experience of your life","My life was changed for the better after listening to this CD. I won the lottery the very next day.Seriously, Noam is a great artist. His music is funny, touching and smart."
1,"""HORRIBLE""","This is, absolutely, the worst book ever written about the Lenape Indians. It is full of uncorroborated statements, gross errors of fact, bizarre assertions, and linguistic gibberish. There is almost no statement regarding the language, history or religion of the Lenape Indians which bears any resemblance to the findings of any linguist, ethnohistorian, anthropologist or archaeologist who ever wrote anything on these subjects. The ""Unami Delaware"" poem, on pages 210-213, uses words NEVER known to any Lenape speaker! There is almost nothing in this book to recommend it."
2,Poorly Written,"I will leave criticism of Pritchard's linguistics to those who know something about the Munsee language, which I do not. Ditto for the intricacies of Lenape culture. But, speaking as an amateur historian of the New York City area I was quite disappointed in the author's style. He jumps all over the place, and at times I felt like I was reading the non-fiction equivalent to ""Finnegan's Wake."" After a few chapters I gave up.The Lenape people deserve a better history."
1,Linguistic Information is Wrong,"I can't personally speak to the historical accuracy of this book, but the purportedly Lenape and Mohican words in this book are not. The author indiscrimately mixes and matches syllables from words in Algonquian languages to come up with Indian ""words"" no native speaker would ever have used, then puts them together into ungrammatical sentences. Some supposedly Lenape words bear no resemblance to the Lenape language at all, and I suspect that they are actually corruptions of southern Algonquian words (i.e. Indian tribes in Virginia and South Carolina).You won't learn anything correct about the original languages of New York from this book, in other words. Given the shockingly slapdash linguistic treatment, I can't recommend trusting the history, either."
5,Fascinating Read,"For anyone interested in the details of the Native Americans living in the New York area, I would highly recommend this book."
5,Also useful for adults,"My husband and I wash our hands all day every day due to our respective jobs. In the winter, our hands start to crack and bleed. We put Desitin on our hands (especially in the cracks) overnight. It really speeds up healing! The zinc oxide is antibacterial also. I don't care what it smells like. The relief is worth the smell!"
3,Are we in the dark ages that we can't have a decent-smelling diaper rash creme?,"For real, why does this have to smell so much like chemicals? McDonald's hamburgers are inert material with a drop of fragrance that makes them smell and taste like hamburgers, why can't Desitin get on the ball and maybe grind up a mint leaf for their butt paste?My baby smelled so awesome when we got him home, I would just lean over him and bury my nose in his baby flesh, and just BREATHE DEEP. Then my baby doctor was like ""you should try some Desitin to prevent diaper rash,"" and now he smells like paint. I can't believe it.I'm sure it does an excellent job on diaper rash, but with that Desitin funk, I'm not getting close enough to my kid's butt to find out.Would NOT buy again."
3,"Star Trek, part Two","I was really looking forward to getting this CD, since I loved the movie so much. But after putting it in the player and hearing some of the tracks, I realized I had heard something like it before. And then it hit me: Some tracks were almost verbatim from the Star Trek II & III Wrath of Kahn and Search for Spock Soundtracks, especially the Klingon attack music. Nuts! I hate it when composers use similar music for different movies. Horner went and got lazy it seems. The other music is Aliens specific and sounds like I remember from the movie, but the other music causes a mental switch and confuses me as to which soundtrack I'm listening to."
4,Great,"Great album!A while ago I couldn't imagine buy a 1986 soundtrack so easily and of course, its contents is as good as the movie itself, terrific!"
5,Really captures the tension and excitement of Aliens!,"Jame Horner's Aliens soundtrack is great. Listening to it really evokes theAliensplot and mood. You can tell when the Space Marines arrive by the distinctly military tone of the music. The rapid approach of the face huggers is met with Horner's rapid tempo tracks.TheAliens: The Deluxe Editionexpands significantly upon the original CD that was released almost two decades ago. It contains almost twice as much music (75 minutes instead of 40 minutes), much of which has never been released before. Some of the best tracks, such as ""Combat Drop"" and ""Face Huggers,"" were not on the original CD. As such, if you love the soundtrack, thisAliens: The Deluxe Editionis a must and well worth the extra price."
5,Music out of this world,"Amazing tracks, a Classic.Too bad the added musicsounds like it's been recordedin an unfinished basement,or a junk filled garage."
1,Not the same as the movie,"If you are buying this for the for the Awesome score they wrote for Ripley's Rescue in the movie, DON'T. This is not the same score at all. It is similar but that is all. I own Alien Anthology and the ""original"" soundtrack and they are very different, I wish I could buy the exact piece they used in this scene. They must have recorded it at the last minute and published the old score on the soundtrack CD. I read that there were a lot of last minute changes in the sound track. If I find a copy I will update this post."
2,"Fit the phone, but affected the proximity sensor","Decent case, but it messed with my girlfriend's phone's proximity sensor so she hated it and we got another one."
4,Quite durable,"This phone case is incredibly durable. I put it on my phone and when I wasn't looking, my golden retriever puppy grabbed it and started chewing on it. She was probably gnawing on it for a good 3 minutes until I noticed. When I grabbed it away from her and inspected it, there were no rips or teeth marks on the phone or the case. I can't believe it stood up to her chewing and protected my phone so well!My one gripe is that the phone won't fit on the charging dock with this case on. Big bummer.The case fits great. Buttons are still easily accessible."
4,Mom of Two,"I am pleased with this purchase! It not only protects my phone but it keeps it from slipping out of my hand or sliding down surfaces. I would purchase again.I need to amend my original review. I have had to stop using this case after using for several months. I finally discovered that the reason my keypad would not show up while on some automated calls was because the case covered up the proximity sensor. For example: When placing a call where one had to press #1 for English, the keypad would not show up."
5,great case,This case feels great in your hands. More cushioning in the back makes it easier to hold. The pink color is more subtle that what is shown in the picture. Fits snugly on Iphone. Wish they made more colors.
5,Phil Collins' second best-seller!,"As the 1980's ended and the 1990's began,Phil Collins scored with a second best-seller,and his fourth all-original album,BUT SERIOUSLY. HANG IN LONG ENOUGH was on the charts when 1990 neared the end. ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE was the album's first hit in November 1989 when this album was released. Other hits include DO YOU REMEMBER?,SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN, and I WISH IT WOULD RAIN DOWN. This album inspired Phil's sophomore band,The Serious Band and the title of the follow-up live album SERIOUS HITS LIVE."
2,Seriously lacking in the songwriting department,"Say what you will about Phil Collins, but his first 3 albums were as good as MOR pop gets. Sadly, this one justifies his reputation as a bland balladeer. Apparently his acting and soundtrack work tapped into his creative juices, because the songs here don't hold up to repeated listenings. Nothing will grab you like ""Sussudio"", one of the lesser songs from ""No Jacket Required"". ""Hang In Long Enough"" is the only track with an edge, but it's undercut by a melody that sounds scotch-taped together.Of the ""socially conscious"" lyrics, only ""Another Day In Paradise"" has anything original to say. I found it moving in 1989, but now it just sounds manipulative. I wish he had included more songs like ""Take Me Home"" and ""Inside Out"" where the lyrics were open to interpretation, and less preaching."
2,With Colours,With colours Collins turns out a quality piece of music making this album better then what came before and theres some big talents on the songs but thats still not saying much as theres a weak cover of The Temptations I Wish It Would Rain Down as well as weak matearial elsewhere.
1,But seriously....this is garbage,SAD THAT PHIL WENT THE WAY OF POP DIVA...HORRIBLE...MAKES ALL PROGRESSIVE FANS CRINGE...SHOULD MAKE ALL MUSIC FANS CRINGE.
4,Top tappin',"I must say that this CD quite impressed me. I'd known that Phil was a big band-ish kind of guy, but I didn't know he used those aspects of music so well.With number like That's Just The Way It Is, Do You Remember and I Wish It Would Rain Down, we know Phil has a soft side. And I like it. He's sad, remiscant and melancholy, yet not depressed and mopey. Heat On The Street and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning pick up the pace a bit and pull some tapping from your toes.As usual, Phil manages to combine kickin' tunes with catchy lryics, making for one heck of a CD.I enjoy this Phil, but I'd like to see more of songs like Find a Way To My Heart and Colors. He's good at making songs with meanings. Let's see more of them."
4,But Seriously,"But Seriously is Collins 1989 release and his 4th studio album and is Collins most political and socially concious albums so far. Even though I tend to dislike political music, Collins manages to write the themes without preaching and the approach is quite subtle and astute. Songs like Anaother day in Paradise and Colours are both social criticism and political statements. Collins does not abandon themes of love and relationships but sings with a greater maturity then he did on earlier records. Songs such as Do you remember and I wish it would rain down deal with such topics. The book-let is a mixed bag of very nice photographs but for some reason they went with a font for the lyrics which is quite tricky to read. A very cute picture of his son (I think so) lying as a baby on a bed. 4/5."
5,The best of the best.,"Lately Phil Collins seems to be experimenting a bit with musicstyles. I'm still a big fan, but some people prefer his earlier work. This CD contains some of his best songs, rythms and thought-provoking lyrics. I love it. If there's one CD you'll ever buy, get this one!"
3,A very respectable album.,"I must admit and confess that I respect this album. Yes, if you have seen my name in ""independient records"" and in those who keep an ""alternative"" style even being commercially successful (like Peter Gabriel, for example) you may be impressed with my comment. But yes, I think this is one of the most honest and touching efforts made by Phil Collins. Of course that there are hits songs, but I think that ""But Seriously"" has a reasonable ammount of art and lyrical honesty. For example, ""Another Day In Paradise"", ant the 'honestly-ethnical' ""Colours"", are a sign that Collins had a chance to get better (it's pretty sad that he did not take it)."
4,A lovable CD - But Seriously!,"But Seriously, Another Day in Paradise was the only track I heard on the televion show and watched the video of Phil there. Oh Boy, this was great to pick up the choice and I luv the tracks there. Honestly, not all songs I luv but, Another day in paradise is one sure to rate five stars and is the best I find of the Phil collins stuff. Something happened on the way to heaven is a good number with a tempo beat and I wish it would rain has a lively luv song notes sung by phil, soft and cheery. Colors bring in a different mood n is a classic song. Find a way to my heart has clear voice of Phil though I feel its a bit slow. A good pick for a change, a retro pick - Another day in Paradise! That's Phil collins how I know n luv to listen this number, not to miss!"
1,I was very disappointed by this shipment,"I was very disappointed by the shipment and the sender.The movie is a very good movie, but unfortunately I couldn't watch it."
5,LITTLE CUTIE! I LOVE YOU T.I.P.,"HE DID A GREAT JOB, FOR HIS FIRST MOVIE ROLE!PEOPLE GET ON MY NERVES SAYING HE CAN'T ACT!LIKE HE DENZEL OR SOMETHING!HE IS SO SMOOTH AND HANDSOME!I CAN'T STOP PLAYING KING CD!I LOVE THIS MOVIE!IT WAS NICE TO SEE JASON WEAVER AND MONICA!EVAN ROSS IS ADORABLE!""I GOT SOME CUTTY LASTNIGHT""I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JULY 18TH FOR THE DVD5 STAR MOVIE AND CD *****LOVE YOU T.I.YOU DID A GREAT JOB!BIG BOI DID AWESOME AS WELL!"
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Watched,"I don't like giving negative reviews, and I don't usually give one star, but I can't think of anything else to rate this movie. When I first read all of the positive reviews I thought maybe this was a movie worth watching. But, I was sorely disappointed when I did get a chance to watch the DVD. What really was the purpose of making this movie? And I don't think that anybody is jealous or player hating on T.I., they're just being honest about this crappy movie. Goodness, I had to skip through to the end, it was so boring and just...I can't even think of words to describe it. And what was so cute about Evan Ross saying that he had gotten some cuttie? Is that supposed to inspire other young black boys to do the same cute thing?"
4,Good,Quality of sound and video were very good and would order more videos on line. The price is also competetive to cable and satelite providers.
3,Nice but...,"The DVD arrived on time, but I could tell it had been rattling around in the case. Not good when it's being shipped across the country. Also, the outside of the package looked like it had been sliced - possibly with a box cutter"
3,decent,"For me, ATL really lacked substance. The first half of the movie carried on entirely too long focusing on nothing but teenagers having fun and partying with friends. That's all fine and good in real life, but as part of a storyline in a movie it just doesn't work. Even if you're a teenanger, I'd find it hard to believe you'd be able to find something interesting going on here.With that said, the plot surprised me by drastically changing direction by the second half, and became more serious with a focus on drama. This is what the movie should have done much, much sooner. Talking about the difficulty of drugs and friends deciding if they really want to hang out together in the long run were important topics brought up in the second half, and this is the part of the movie that really made up for the boring extensive first half. Also, the final 10 minutes were really good.Because the first half of the movie was dominated with so much nothingness, I really can't recommend this film to anyone."
4,I applaud TI for his effort,because this movie wasn't anything that I expected it to be. The fact that it wasn't based around a load of violence made it stand out as one of the more refreshing and less told stories of growing up in the hood. ATL was still hip enough to carry out the true aura of hood life but still captured ideals in the black community to include education and the ability to rise above the odds. I thought ATL was a pretty good movie and I would recommend watching it especially if you are tired of the run of the mill shoot em up cursing over and profanity filled films that are released so very often.
5,Great movie with a GREAT story!,"I would have never known that rapper T.I was such a great actor!!The movie ATL was so great, that it's one of my favorites. There is a dynamic cast. This movie has a great moral to follow at the end, and it's definantly a tearjerker, but at the same time it's a comedy. You have to own this movie. I know that you won't be disapointed.By the way, I have NO CLUE why someone tagged this movie as 50 cent? ha."
4,John J. Rhodes,A very revealing story of a successful; yet disciplined politician who served his country with conscince and diligence.
4,"Great game, just 1 thing wrong","I got this game about a month ago and so far it has been great. I am about 2/3 of the way through the championships. The only complaint I have about the game is that the steering response is a bit delayed if not on no assist, even with response and scale all the way up. Other than that it is almost the perfect game, the thing you do to correct the problem is to turn off assist all the way. I would definetely recommend it for anyone who likes auto racing, in any form of it."
5,Best Album,I would say that this is the best mix so far. Of course they have all been great but these songs are mostly upbeat and more catchy than previous mixes.
4,A good album with some amazing songs,"I must say that I, too, am a huge fan of the music of The O.C. They continually find little known bands that add so much to the flavor of the show. This the fifth O.C. mix is a good one in and of itself. I must say, though, that it isn't quite as good as the fourth mix. This mix has some hit and miss songs, but on the whole the album is great. I particularly like Imogen Heap's Hide and Seek, which was the season finale song. Absolutely amazing, every single time I listen to that song. Throw in Forever Young and the album is more than worth it. I would recommend."
4,"Good quick read, great to go back to","This gives you a great base to do mentoring, lots of things to consider about being a mentor....You can easily go back to it and assess your current mentoring relationships."
2,FOR JOE LOVANO NONET FANS ONLY,"I am not trying to be funny or sarcastic but the ensemble sound is real Lovanoesque featherweight. George Coleman can't break through the Atlantic sound quality and Johnny Coles is worse than usual, if you know what I mean. Stick with the Blue Notes and DEDICATION! where Freddie Hubbard and Pepper Adams inspire each other to greater heights. There is a no name Trombonist in the sextet who drags out a couple of ballad features but it's allright. Get it cheap but get it. It's better than THE RIGHT TOUCH for my money."
2,A great introduction to the history of the language for the Layman,"Writen over 30 years ago Horowitz's book is still a minor classic.Surely there is no better introduction to the long history of the holy tounge for the English speaker with a good working knowlege of Hebrew.Althogh writen for schoools the book is suitable for those who long left Hebrew school or ""Heder""We are introduced to some basic principles of the semitic languages then countless examples are given from both modern and biblical Hebrew.Horowitz's book is not a leaned scientific study... but its an informative read for anyone who loves the Hebrew language whether he uses it at study , prayer as as his everyday language."
5,Good for young readers.,"This is indeed an informative, well presented book written in a pleasant style. The author refers to his seventh and eighth grade students, and buyers should be aware that the reading level of the book is appropriate for a rather bright child."
4,A genuinely practical primer for sole proprietorships.,"Donna Murphy has succeeded where many have failed. She provides a genuinely practical primer that sole proprietors can use to keep their books in order--and avoid that dreaded letter from the IRS. With a generous sampling of forms, a sensible six-step approach to the material, and a wise and witty writing style, Murphy has produced a winner that is sure to go into many subsequent editions."
3,its good but not worth more than $5,Id seen this years before and am a huge Ellen fan as is my husband aol I saw it for cheap and got it. Ellen is great...
2,A few laughs early on...but no chemistry.,"Being gay doesn't stop you from pulling off a heterosexual, romantic comedy. Rock Hudson was the sexiest man on screen to a whole generation,but Rock could act. Ellen isn't an actress, she is a comedian. While Pullman's character initially comes off as suave and sophisticated before degenerating into complete idiocy, Ellen does little more than smile at him as if she were a 12 year old girl out with daddy. The scene where they tear their clothes off to have sex seems completely out of place. It is silly but not really funny. Here her goofy smile just doesn't work. Pullman does a good job with this very shallow role, but he can't make the script work or Ellen seem desirable and sexy enough to be worth the obsession he develops for her."
5,Ellen at her best!,"This movie is so funny. Bill Pullman was great in his part. I don't usually buy movies, but this is a keeper."
1,"Ugh, can I give it zero stars? Negative stars?","This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw it in the theater! That's right, I paid $7 to not laugh at this supposed ""comedy"" for two hours. I hated this movie so much that I'm actually irritated that I spent two hours of my life that I can never have back watching it. Avoid the same fate, don't see this movie! It's not even one of those ""so-bad-it's-funny"" movies! It's just bad! Stay away!"
1,Dear johnny8ball :,"If caviar came served in dirty trash cans , nobody would eat it. Do you know what I'm saying ?"
1,Horrible!,This was HORRIBLE. Wish I could return it! She even looks like a DYKE in this film. Now I know why she hasn't made anymore films....Nobody can picture her with a man...ever!
1,I don't get it,"I got this movie on pay per view last weekend and just flat didn't understand it. I think Ellen Degenerous is as funny as Bill Engvall and Louis Anderson most of the time but I didn't get this story. I thought Ellen liked girls and this fact was known by everyone. So why is she making a movie about liking a guy(the super actor Bill Pullman)that goes psycho. I knew she dated Anne Hench who I guess went psycho on her in real life. Hench also did a movie where she liked a guy. Please, I'm not very smart so make movies that I can understand. If you like girls so be it, in fact I'm totally cool with it, but don't pretend to fall for the great Bull Pillman if you don't like guys anyway. It's not like I would do a thriller with Natalie Portman and date a dude in real life. I'm totally straight and would date Natalie Portman in real life. So please quit confusing me with these kinds of films."
4,unbelivable fun,Ellen Degeneres is wonderful in this role. You can feel her desperation when she is trapped by her abnormal boyfriend (Bill Pullman). It is an incredible dark comedy.
4,"Hey, it's funny!","There are so many ridiculous little events throughout this movie that my wife and I are constantly quoting lines to each other... ""YOU WANT GUM IN YOUR HAIR?!?"" ""I'm your special freind from God."" It cracks me up. Silly characters, silly story line, all around good fun. So trust me and, if you don't buy it, at least rent it and you'll see what I'm talking about. Otherwise I'll have to '...give you the monkey! The mother-lovin' MONKEY!'"
5,One of my FAVORITE movies!,"The people who didn't like this movie must have been watching something else because Mr. Wrong makes me laugh so hard my stomach hurts! I have never laughed so hard at a comedy! Ellen is perfect! She's the only sane person in this completely INSANE movie! A lot of the jokes aren't found in one liners but in the facial expressions of the actors. Take a look at Ellen's face when her ""daughter"" reveals that she wasn't holding her up with a gun but by a squirt gun! Ellen's face is priceless! By the end of this movie I have tears in my eyes from laughter! One of the best movies EVER made!"
3,5 stars for Ellen but 3 stars for content,Ellen was a pretty good actress..she's great in stand-up but I was surprised at how well she acted...The story content was a little predictable but it was fun to watch...
2,Mr. Wrong,"I am a fan of both degeneres and pullman, and sadly the chemistry is lacking.... I think the plot or scenario is totally unreal and that makes the movie a flop."
1,The Wrong Movie,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen! I kept waiting for it to finish so that I could say that I had seen it. The plot and the dialogue dragged, and there was no chemistry between the protagonists."
2,My Boring Movie...and I Did Make One,"For die-hard Ellen DeGeneres fans who love to see their heroine in anything, no matter how bad the film may be! What starts off as a possibly funny movie ends being boring and predictable, chock full of sit-com cliches and silly banter. The movie tries to be funny and serious at the same time and end up being neither. I'm not convinced by Ms. DeGeneres' character, Martha, as she dresses and acts too much like Ellen Morgan minus the humor, the witty lines and the great supporting cast. END"
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WRITER WAS THINKING!,"Good comedy should have a strong sense of reality. After all, laughter is a release of frustrations and pain that takes place in your real life. This movie just is not realistic. Ellen is great, and the film could have been good if it kept to realism. That altar scene is one example. Half way thru, I lost interest. Save your money!"
1,My Trashy Movie...and I Did Make One,"I am a great fan of Ellen's, but this movie pure trash and a waste of time. It vacillates between a madcap ""Lucille Ball"" sit-com and a dark comedy about stalking, but suceeds in neither. To their credit, Pullman and DeGeneres try hard to wring some humor out of this idiotic script but their efforts were in vain. No actor, no matter how talented, could save this lousy movie. I am amazed that a star of DeGeneres' magnitude would even bother to do such a film. For the sake of all Ellen fans and audiences everywhere, let's just hope the writers and producers of this awful, NOT FUNNY film have been put out to pasture."
2,Unfortunate choice of actors,"I enjoyed the whole ""romantic comedy gone wrong"" theme, and the music was well thought out. Unfortunately, I dislike Bill Pullman as an actor (a purely personal thing, I'll admit), and I couldn't really take Ellen DeGeneres seriously as a bride - or as much else in the movie! Otherwise a good movie, but the ""stars"" ruined it for me."
2,wrong move,i didn't like this movie. i ordered it on pay per view and thought it was pretty good but it gets worse with age.
1,Yuck!,I am a big Bill Pullman fan and this movie is the only Bill Pulman movie that I have seen that I absolutly HATED! Do even bothing thinking of seeing it.
1,"you call this a movie, a bombed movie","This movie was the most trashiest movie I have ever seen. It degrades the concept of a movie! With no story line, a pathetic plot and the acting was horrific I saw the shorts for it one day and my friend and I thought we would see it just for fun, at the end of the movie I came out disappointed and unfulfilled at what the movie magic was supposed to do. This movie shouldn't have even be put to the big screen it was (to put it bluntly) absolutely awful. It's a degradation of a movie for the 90's and I regret paying my $6.50 to see that, if I could rewind time I wish I had never EVER set foot in that cinema."
4,Mr. Wrong is Mr. Wonderful,"This movie is gut-bustingly funny, if you don't take it too seriously. It came out before Ellen did, and she does a convinvcing job of being head-over-heels attracted to Bill Pullman (like that would be hard!). But then as Pullman's character goes more and more over-the-top--and, just when you think he couldn't get any crazier, he does--Ellen's plight becomes more and more dangerous.This film and ""The Cable Guy"" have a lot in common, but ""Mr. Wrong"" is funnier, longer."
2,does not work for the vehicle for which it was advertised.,"I bought this item and I was very dissapointed from the moment I opened the package, why you may ask, becauce clearly it was not the correct lift for the vehicle it was advertised for. I am the owner of said vehicle the ad said it was for but when I saw the item it was smaller and the connectors were not the same it was not remove and replace. So it made me drill holes to install, I wss again dissapointed because it never worked it could not hold up the tailgate. SO I'M BACK TO SQUARE ONE, i have to use a stick to hold it up, waste of time!!!!"
1,This is not a Zire 72 cable,"If the product matches the photo, it is a Zire 71 cable.The Zire 72 uses two connectors, a mini-USB and a circular power connector. I've been bitten already with the wrong cable from a different seller. It cost me return shipping to get my payment back. I've found most of the 154,000 Web pages from a search for ""zire 72 travel charger"" have the same error.It's only good for one star because zero stars isn't accepted."
1,Canon Service is Horrible,"I have a Canon G2. It broke in July, and then again in August. I've sent it in four times since then to be repaired, and each time they've sent it back without fixing it. I've paid $150 + tons on shipping and I can't even get the thing to turn on. Save yourself the headache and buy another brand."
1,Buyer Beware - No Date Stamps On Photos?,"I own a G3, and it does NOT let you put the date stamp on a photo. Canon is living in the dark ages. I'm unsure if this is still a ""feature"" on the G5. Do your homework before you buy this camera.At this price point, printing the dates on photos shouldn't be something you have to worry about."
5,Canon G5,"Wasn't sure if I wanted to buy the camera due to critical information that people have gave the product dissing it and giving bad opinions so I talked to a few professional photographers on the G5 and they had said it was well worth the money for being the best Digital advanced point and shoot so far by Canon,having 12 Eos based features as well.As an amateur photographer I have no regrets at all, it is an awesome camera!"
4,"Good Full Feature Camera, Some Issues","I have been really happy with the overall performance of this camera. I love being able to change how many pixels I want for my photos. I frequently will use the 5 pixel function so that I can later crop photos as necessary. Sometimes I wish that the camera were smaller. Also, we had to send the camera back to the manufacturer because the battery closure warped and the camera kept losing power. They fixed it quickly and for free. I was happy with the service."
1,Save money and get yourself a G3 or Nikon 4500,All the hype about DIGIC and G5 is just that..The ISO settings at 200 or 400 don't really work well..the photos are grainy in low light when compared to a Nikon 4500.Canon has taken a step back with G5. I am not impressed with the feature set at all
1,don't know yet,"got the camera but cannot really do anything. Doesn't matter how long I charge, I cannot turn on the camera. The LCD shows ""change the battery"" and shutdown. Bad QA i guess. Or they ship a bad battery. Still nothing from Canon support yet. No star if I could since I could not even use the camera."
2,go with the g2,I am a g2 owner and the g5 just didnt measure up to the g2.I got the g5 thinking that I was upgrading but the joke was on me. I did a side by side shootout with the g2 and g5 and the g2 beat it every time.the g5 has a lot of noise and seems to have slower shutter speed leading to lots of blured pictures.I used the same settings on both cameras when testing. If you try to use the g5 with a higher iso then 50 all you get is noise. I have been a long time canon fan and still am but I am sending this one back. All the g5 did was make me love my g2 even more.
3,Too many shortcomings,"I got this camera a week ago. I would not recommend this camera to others. 1) The optical viewfinder is partially blocked by the lens. I find this very annoying. It makes the optical viewfinder partially crippled. 2) Chromatic aberration. If you shoot a back lighted object (say in front of a mirro with flash on) you will see a blue halo along the edge of the object. 3) Camera body not ergonomically designed. It is hard to hold the camera with one hand, since the camera body does not fit the right hand ergonomically. You will have to use both hands. 4) One has to remove the lens cap before turning on the camera. This is also very annoying. I wish I could keep the lens cap on with the camera turned on. It protects the camera lens between shots. 5) Camera lens can be easily smeared without the cap. It is not recessed deep enough."
2,"Good, but has some problems","This game, although it's been out for a while, combines good gameplay along with awsome strategy. It is a very good choice for those who like to use cunning and wit to fool guards, make distractions, sneak around ,and overall, escape. Although it's a very great game, my games frequently crash and my save files often become corrupt. So when buying this game, keep in mind that it might crash and delete your files."
3,Outdated,"Surely it's a bargain priced game but it is kinda outdated and slow paced. If you can handle that, it's a good deal but i lost interest after a few hours."
3,Calculating drug dossges: an interactive approach to learning nursing math.,It was the wrong book. My class requires Ed 2 and this was clearly not that book. I am very disappointed and wish I had not ordered online.
1,Upsampled Redbook CD quality audio,"If you are buying this because you want higher-resolution audio, i.e., the 24-bit, 96 kHz tracks this claims to have, you will be very disappointed. I checked, and it is anything but. I put a customer image of an Audacity-produced FFT spectrum up so you can see for yourself. With Neil Young expounding upon the virtues of high-resolution music, I find this more than simply a disappointment. It is a misrepresentation.This is one of his best albums, and I would give the CD five stars."
3,interesting sounds and visuals,"I picked up this video because I am more of a lanois fan than a young fan. I appreciate neil young's frankness as an artist, I like his voice. I became familiar with lanois when he worked with U2. if you liked the Achtung Baby album from U2, the saturated unworldly sounds, then you might find this album interesting. While neil sings about life, love and the state of the world Lanois trys to punctuate the songs with mood through distortion and tweeking of guitar signals and vocals WHILE THE SONG IS BEING PERFORMED LIVE with possible overdubs later.interesting if you like audio/performance experiments...sometimes moving other times puzzling."
5,Great NY!,"As always, Neil Young is amazing and awesome! We love this! If you're a Neil Fan, you need this to complete your collection!"
2,Getting old.,"It has been always interesting to watch Neil's performance. However, as time goes by we have been addicted to getting high. In this work Neil plays alone with his old guitar doing what he does. I should recommend it only for old funs."
3,"Come along Neil, be fair...","Great album but why only a Region 1 release on Blu-Ray? What about fans in the rest of the world? Having shelled out for a player so I could get the best out of Archives Vol 1, it now looks like someone's waving a finger and laughing.... No BD-live? Have you lost faith in Blu-Ray already?"
1,The worst album I have ever heard,"Not sure which planet the people are from who rated this album highly but it can't be planet earth.This album is so bad that it is even worse than the soundtrack from ""Tom Thumb"" starring Russ Tamblyn fifty years ago.Really, really bad. A total waste of money.Oh yeah, and I didn't like it."
5,great recording!!,"I admit I was glad beyond belief to actually find a recording of this rarely performed/recorded opera. It is an excellent buy for a live recording, and the singers (most, if not all of them are unknown to me) exceed my expectations in terms of their interpretation and quality of performance. Susan Bullock, although not quite the dramatic voice I was hoping for, does a great job in potraying Magda. She is accompanied by a musically effective cast, and is rightly applauded by the audience in the most appropriate moments. If you're looking for one of the best American operas ever recorded, this is it!!!"
5,Music by Sean Callery,I just loved this cd. I am a big fan of 24 and the music has a special place too. While listening to you can remember the things that happened during seasons four and five. I especially liked the songs titled Jack's women. Buy it you'll really enjoy it.
3,24 ; Season s 4 & 5,"I found this music presentation laced with some very touching moments. However, I do not feel that it equals the ""Season 1,2 and 3"" CD in overall enjoyability."
4,Callery in good form,"Great album, collecting all the musical pieces you remember from the series. My only gripe as a purest, is that the opening theme is not the exact one from the show and that so many tracks from the 24 game have been included. I would have preferred the album to contain only pieces exclusive to the season 4 & 5. Still, it works as a collection of fine music. good to exercise to or perhaps do housework to if you're against the clock..."
5,24 Soundtrack Seasons 4 & 5,I really love this CD. Being such an avid fan of 24 having the music to it brings back all the events the music represents. It's just great and I recommend it to all 24 fans
4,Great background music,"I really enjoy 24, especially music from the show. Overall, this CD is not quite as good as the first one, but it does have one or two tracks that are better than any on the first CD. So it is a mixed bag, but one I don't regret getting."
1,Gameshark Starter Kit for Ps One & 2,"This product is misleading. It said that it had 1,000's of sheat codes including those for a select few of games but thats all the cheat codes it contains. Also its not a real gameshark and isnt recognized on the gameshark site."
1,When all the reports say the same thing......,"Gameshark Starter Kit for Ps One & 2The product came fast but the description is misleading.... The only thing that comes in the box that is practical is the remote. There are very few codes that come pre-loaded on a disc, but no way to add new codes. The box I received was opened previously in a fairly sneaky way NOT NEW, and I'm not sure if something is missing because I can't find a manual inside of any sort. This is so bad I won't even contact the seller... they know what they're doing. I feel ripped off and cheated..."
3,my opinion,"the controller was not compatible with my ps2,i'm not sure if it was a mistake on my part or a typo, either way i got what i ordered"
3,Not a recemended buy from me.,The drive rod on drivers side was missing a bushing had to order a new rod and the wiper arms hold down is inposible to push down on the pivot post without bending the clips and they fall out of place.More mad at myself for not observing this while i restored that delayed time before i installed the parts but ended up using the old wiper arms.
1,the lights went out,My daughter bought the little totable book light for me along with a book for my birthday. She purchased it at a local bookstore because I enjoy reading in bed . After only 2 months time the batteries which were brand new leaked allover the inside of the light. It now is unusable. I always closed it up after I finished reading. It should have lasted much longer..
2,Cute But Cheaply Made,"My daughter loves this coat and rainboot combo, but the coat is very cheaply made. It's so poorly made that in taking it out of the plastic wrap around it, one of the ears pulled right off. My daughter didn't want me to send it back for a new one because she didn't want to wait so we just used black tape to put the ear back on but I have to redo the tape every two or three times she wears it. I would not purchase this brand ever again. I usually buy Kidorable brand rain coats and boots and get a few years out of them. I purchased the WC one because of the pattern and ordered my son a Kidorable one. They both arrived within a few days of each other and this WC dalmation coat is so much flimsier feeling that the Kidorable one. Despite the fact that it is flimsier it was actually more expensive than the other one. No bargain here. The only reason I even give it two stars is becasue the pattern is so cute we are often complimented on it."
5,"When Suffering hits home, Pity is no more","I read this book, although of the title _No Blade of Grass_ just recently, and because I always enjoy the author's work.A virus is affecting grasses. At first only rice in the Far East, and then all grasses. No wheat, no rice, no oats, none of the staple plants needed by man to feed himself and his livestock. Panic strikes the world. A few small families have the hope of a farm on the other side of England, and flee London when they can.They survive. But how would you change if you were constantly deciding between your own humanity and your family's well-being?Find the book, and read it. I don't think you will be disappointed."
2,Not Good.,"Maybe the saphire part was okay - good color. But, these earrings fell apart after one wearing. I don't recommend them."
3,"Great story, forgettable ending...","Eric Garcia's two previous ""Rex"" novels were wonderful; fast-paced, intelligent, and absurdly believable. ""Matchstick Men"" begins in the same tradition. The characters are only sketched out, but how much do we really need to know about two con-men? Once Angela is introduced, the book takes off. She is the real star of the book, and Nicholas Cage is going to be severely upstaged by her character in the movie (and rightly so!)The biggest disappointment I had was with the ending. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that it was sufficiently jarring and out of character to ruin the rest of the novel for me. The first 220 pages get five stars, the last ten get only one.I do think, however, that the book is full of the same promise that Garcia showcased so well in the Rex books, and I am eager to read ""Hot and Sweaty Rex"" when it comes out in 2003."
2,Save your money...,"My children and I loved the other Garfield movies but this one was contrived, convoluted and not very funny."
1,what a joke,save ur money on this joint rite here son! its str8 sheet word iz born son its so alley! so don't b cheap and buy this garb or because ralph tresvant from new edition in here! save ya stratch
4,Very informative,Great book to get you set up. Requires some concentration but definitely increases your knowledge base which is what this is all about....Try it...
5,Heavenly!!!!,"This was a true and a very talented artist. He and Roberta Flack has done so many great duets together. He has done some great music alone. This man is a great singer, musician, and artist. He has a daughter by name of Lalah Hathaway. Lalah is a beautiful woman with a beautiful woman she has soul and talent just like her father. Lalah is an exceptional singer she inherited her talent from her father. But this is a nice compilation of Donny's music I enjoy these songs I enjoy the duets with Roberta and the solo songs as well. So, therefore if you are a fan of Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway then I would definitely recommend this album . It contains a lot of good songs."
5,Where is the love? HERE lT lS!!!,"Go figure, Donnie sings about ''This Christmas'', yet this is a gift for all seasons. Too bad it's been 3O years since he has given us any gifts. This Don gives us an offer we don't want to refuse."
5,Awesome music,Previously owned and I am very happy now that I have replaced it. Donny was exceptional and his music expands time.
5,Soul Music,Mr. Hathaway put heart and soul in all the music he sings. He touches on feeling as you listen to him hit high and low notes.
5,A Must-Have,"Donny Hathaway is classic; in the same Soul stratum as Stevie Wonder and Sam Cooke. There is no comparison, but if you love Stevie and Sam you'll love Donny. Donny Hathaway's voice is clear and passionate. And of course his duets with Roberta Flack are something else. My favorite songs: ""Song For You"" (which gives me chills everytime I hear it. I would love to hear Alicia Keys cover this song because of the beautiful piano arrangement. If you know Alicia relay the message for me. Thanks.); ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know,"" and ""Giving Up."" Buy this album, burn it if you're broke. This is an artist you must have in your collection."
5,TWO THUMBS UP!,"OMG!! This CD is GREAT! A Song for You is the best song on tha cd...it's my favorite Hathaway song...you can tell he song his heart out on that one...All tha other songs are just as great but A Song for You is my most favorite along with..""BACK TOGETHER AGAIN"", ""GIVING UP"", ""THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU"", ""THE GHETTO"", ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND""...simply put...all tha songs on this cd is GREAT..You will NOT fast forward or skip one song cuz it's that GREAT!TWO THUMBS UP!"
4,Elliott is the Best,"To all the Elliott ""haters"", please leave him alone. I and many, many...others love him and his voice. To take Simon's statement one step further ...Elliott is the best male singer in the brief histroy of AI. I love you Elliott...you made Richmond and all of VA very proud. I do look forward to your album and when you come to DC."
4,Good collection volume,"Listening to this album, which I purchased with Donny's live album, I find that the studio recordings are great archival material but do not quite capture the magic he grenerated live. The album contains many songs that are not on the live album and is a great addition to help round out my collection. My advice, however, is to get the Live album performances as well."
2,I really missed Donny!,"This remix is good except the last song. What in world were they doing??? Somebody just put in a crazy, drum; CRAZY; STARTLING!!! It makes that song completely avoidable. Unfortunate. It is not Donny but the folks in the studio."
5,This is Christmas,"Donny Hathaway's ""This Christmas"" will always be my favorite contemporary Christmas song and it is a joy that it is included in this collection. The world lost Donny way too soon."
3,Medicore song choices,"This compendium of Chicago's second best known son (besides Curtis Mayfield), aims to collect more of Hathaway's vocal hits and duets with Roberta Flack than this overall arranging or songwriting genius (e.g. leaving out half of the suite that opens the ""Extension of a Man"" LP). This collection is for the casual collector who doesn't want to purchase the Flack LPs (decent as they maybe - both the ""Black Album"" and ""Blue Lights in the Basement"" are better than period pieces, and the latter is quite funky). If you want to figure out more of Hathaway's arranging or keyboard genius, check out the Aretha Franklin Atlantic Records box set or ""Live""."
5,BACK WHEN MUSIC WAS GOOD,Donny is probably the most 'known' unknown artist. his style is smooth yet with feeling and soul. This is a reminder of when music was good.If you are a true classic soul fan you will indeed love this album. It doesnt include ALL of donny's hits..but it includes a lot of them.
5,"Not Just Known For ""The Closer I Get To You"".....","This is my favorite cd. Whether it's for mental relaxation, inspiration, or whatever, this cd is a must. After listening to this cd, anyone who appreciates ""good music"" will be willing to seek out other titles from this talented artist."
3,Not a great CD!,I thougth this was a good CD but no! the songs are awful.I don't like it at all! I will not recommend anyone tobuy CD's without checking its contents!
2,Not what's pictured,"Amazon uses a stock picture for this product, but unfortunately it's not the correct one. Bendix does not make a rear pad with the blue coating, so you get a regular semi-metallic pad.They are EE rated, so don't expect improved performance over stock. They do stop the car and haven't come apart yet."
3,Good,I have not installed these brake pads on my car as of yet. But. They were delivered in excellent conditon. I will recommend these brake pads. Bendix quality is exceptional.
1,poor little rich girl !,"I'm sorry but I could not identify with or feel sorry for this poor little rich girl with the perfect body. If she had truly become independent and had gotten over her teenage obsession I could have respected her. But as it was she was really pathetic. Why would someone move in with a boyfriend without having sex with him first or even being physically attracted to him ? The ""hero"" was a jerk and a user and I figure I would give their marriage two years on the outside. Sad excuse for a book."
4,a good starting point,"Obviously with a compilation that covers so many musical epochs and genres there is going to be a lot of material you don't like. Indeed there are quite a few of the 56 songs here that I just don't care for, but there are just as many songs on here that I love that have introduced me to some artists that I mightn't have otherwise heard: Spacemen 3, Pere Ubu, Cabaret Voltaire, The Chills etc; this 4 disc set is like meeting someone with a great punk and indie record collection and having them play a whole bunch of stuff for you. Some of it you might have heard before, but there'll always be some songs that passed you by that you'll want to own. Don't be put off by the price either, for four discs of such classic music it's well worth the admission fee."
4,This brings it all together!!,"This CD takes you through Buju's evolution as an artist. From the first track, you can envision 'BUJU MOVIN', through the 'Hills and Valleys' of his career and maturing to be who he has ultimately become, one of the greatest reggae artists of our time. He has successfully become a more concious and spiritual artist without alienating his core dancehall fans. Most of his hip-hop cross-over prone peers are left scratching their heads saying ""How he a do dat?"" 'Untold Stories' still stands out as the class of this album. Very basic instruments, guitar and congo drums, make you focus on his political laments, very ""Bob Marleyesque"" I wish more songs from 'Til Shiloh' where included in this but I can live with this. This is an excellent compilation and should serve to satisfy people who want to hear Buju for the first time but are unsure of what album to buy."
4,Great CD,This CD has many of the early Buju tunes that fans who were late teens / early 20's when these tunes dropped can really appreciate. Some real Buju classics on this one.
4,BUJU IS COOL,"look, whoever says that Buju Banton is a disgrace to reggae they got something wrong with them. okay, maybe he's not the best, but he is pretty damn good and has a totally individual vocal style. i am a rasta (at least i try) and i have a reggae band and i know that he is good."
5,Beautiful,"This book is just beautiful. There is so much going on: pirates, bears, Westley's misunderstanding of the phrase ""ring bearer."" It's a lot to juggle, but the author manages it with real aplomb. What seems like it could feel forced and unlikely winds up feeling inevitable and true. This author genuinely captures a boy's feelings of dismay at the impending disruption of the cozy world he and his mother so imaginatively inhabit, and the ending he pulls off is a touching and satisfying surprise. The illustrator seems to have really taken to heart the many levels of story-telling here. He's really given the tale depth and richness. I won't be a bit surprised to see this book win awards for both text and pictures."
4,"great looking shoe, but size runs large","ordered a 10.5, but guess a 10 would have been best. usually wear an 11 in sneakers"
3,Classic look but disappointing quality,I still like the look of these shoes but was disappointed in the quality of the materials and workmanship (relative to an earlier pair I had purchased). They still look ok from a distance but a close inspection reveals flaws and they don't feel as sturdy as I recall. My impression is that the manufacturer has been cutting corners. I would only purchase them again if they were on sale.
2,Nice but not comfortable,"I just got my Hush puppies shoes. Delivery time was ok, packaging it could be better but I do not complain, shoe size correct, nice looking with good leather quality. However I rate it two because I expected a comfortable shoe as well and this is not the one. Your heel hurts after walking for a while. If you are looking for comfort do not try this model."
5,Learn Direct Marketing the easy way,"What a refreshing way to learn! Quite different from the often boring textbook approach so common with marketing books. This semi-autobiography reads like a novel, but teaches direct response advertising through example and life experiences.Just starting out, in his second project, he acquired over 450,000 customers! (and those are repeat customers at that). He knew what he was doing. Plenty of wise advice in there. You can learn from his mistakes and successes.I plowed through 1/2 the book in no time. By then I realized that the reading experience would be over too soon. So I shelved the rest of the book for a treat later on. (So technically this review is only for the first 1/2 of the book). This book is like candy. I got to ration it out before it's gone ;-)"
2,ugh,this gun is great if you are week....this gun shoots barely 90ft the plastic on this gun is very cheap and breaks easy i have ahd to parts start to crack but nothing a lil gurrilla glue cant fix
1,This...... RAP???,He's saying he's not the greatest rapper when he is not even a rapper. this is the lamest song ever.
5,who knows where to get the cd?,where can i find the whole cd? I first heard 1000 clowns on a CD i got from Journeys. Kev is the bomb. check out 'I love NY' and 'Kitty Kat Max'. this is not gansta rap. this stuff has a veri mello groove to it.
5,soccer - skills and drills,"As a newcomer to soccer I searched for a book that could be used as a reference for basic skills and drills to use to practice and master the skills. This book has it all. It is a gem. There are step by step pictures of each skill and a drill(s) to practice the skill presented. I have and continue to use this book for and with my daughter. Unfortunately, it is likely very hard to find but by all means look for it or request it and perhaps it will be reprinted. Soccer is here to stay. This book was written by a professional British soccer coach who has worked with children so has the ability and knowledge of how to explain skills in an easy to understand way for all ages of soccer players, coaches and parents. We have attended private lessons, camps etc.... and this book covers the skills taught but in an easy to reference format. LOOK FOR IT, ASK FOR IT, AND BUY IT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY USE IT....."
3,Huge,"This outfit is super cute but it is definitely not 0-3 month size. This looks more like the 9-12 month clothes that I have. I bought this as a cute outfit for first pictures and maybe for coming home from the hospital, but it probably won't fit the baby for at least 6 months. It also had a small stain and snag in the middle of the chest when it arrived. Overall, it's an adorable onesie and it seems to be well made, but I was a little disappointed by the stain and the obvious size misrepresentation."
3,Sweet,"Its a sweet dress. Well woven, its too big for a 0-3 month old baby but I am happy it would last her at-least another year coz its beautiful.Just one complaint -it has way too many buttons on the bottom ...babies will cry their lungs out when you put this on and try to close all the buttons. A zip would have been better.Update- My baby hasn't really worn it much. She just wore it 3 times and she is 3 months now ..not that she rolls on the ground or does any acrobatics but it already has loose weaves and threads between locks."
2,Too big!,"I bought the 0-3 month romper in natural hoping my little one could wear it home from the hospital. Not gonna happen. This thing is easily big enough for a 9-12 mo. baby. Even after washing in warm water, the bodice still way too long for a newborn. The color is also off. More of a deep beige rather than ivory/white as shown."
4,CUTE!!,I LOVE THIS SWEATER SUIT! IT IS SO CUTE ON MY SON. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT IS WAY TOO BIG FOR A NEWBORN. MY SON WAS NOT ABLE TO WEAR IT UNTIL HE WAS ALMOST 3 MONTHS.
4,Nice Dynex USB 4-Port PCI Card,"Bought this card to replace a no-name 5-port USB 2.0 card that just died, but had worked well for approx. 10 years in my old circa. 2000 Dell T500 computer that had only USB 1.0 ports. Took the old card out and shoved in the new Dynex, upon computer/WinXPSP3 reboot, it was recognized without issues and it was ready for use. In a few tests, the Dynex card performed file transfers between one of my flash drives and a portable USB hard-disk at speeds comparable to my old card. At least in my case, a good buy at an inexpensive price from an Amazon merchant for less than $10 including shipping."
5,This is a great car seat !,"We bought the car seat in January of 2004 and we love it ! My son was 2 1/2 yrs when we got it for him and even he thought it was great. We registered our car seat and had no problems receiving the replacement part for the harness as well as very good instructions, I don't know what these other people are complaining about. I recommend this car seat to all my friends and I am buying a second one for my second child.Mychele from Scottsdale"
2,Maybe mine is defective?,"Am I the only one who has a problem with the Britax Marathon? The straps on my Marathon do not tighten evenly. The harness is always tighter over one shoulder than the other. I called the company to ask about this, and they said there was probably a twist in the strap somewhere behind the seat. I was told to take the harness apart and put it back together. I did this, but the problem has continued. As far as I can see, the problem is not the result of ""user error."" I tighten/loosen the harness exactly as the Britax customer service person told me to. So I hate this car seat. It seems very unsafe to me to have one side of the harness always too loose. Britax will not replace the seat, despite the fact that it was ""recalled"" for a harness-safety issue. I'd never buy another Britax."
5,I Love This Car Seat,I bought this car seat when my son was 4 months old and I love it! The straps are very thick and do not tangle. There is a lot of extra cushion so it seems very comfy. I have a 22 month old child that I am thinking of replacing his Graco Booster seat with. This is so much more durable and the straps on the Graco constantly twist on me. I know it is expensive but in the long run it is so worth it!
3,Won't last up to 65 pounds as promised,"I spent the extra $$$ on this seat because of the safety reputation Britax has and because it is promised that the seat is for kids up to 65 lbs. Guess what? My son is 3 years old and 33 lbs now, BUT he only has one-and-a-half inches grow to outgrow this seat! He is of average height and weight, nothing special. I highly doubt that he'll weigh 65 lbs by the time he outgrows this seat (he'd have to be very fat!). Britax must either stop lying about the 65 pounds, or make the necesarry adjustments to the seat."
5,If you have a big kid you MUST buy this!,"My 2 year old is a big boy, he outgrew his infant seat at 4 months. I bought him the Britax Roundabout which I LOVE but am KICKING myself for not spending the extra money and buying the Marathon! He is now 2 years old and 40 pounds and they are not supposed to go into a booster (...) So, I had to go out and buy the Marathon yesterday. It is one of the ONLY convertible seats that goes up to 65 pounds. I could have spent an extra $50 two years ago, now I had to spend over $200! IF YOU HAVE A BIG BABY, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THE MARATHON!!!"
5,love these seats,We bought a marathon for my oldest son because at 2 1/2 he was growing out of his other convertable seat and was not ready for a booster. We moved his brother into his seat. We were on a trip and before the trip was over we went out and bought his brother one too. They are big but we have taken them both on an airplane before (it was a pain but worth it). Both boys sleep in them well and my oldest will be 4 next month and still has a ways to go it it. I dont think I know of a car seat that children cant loosen the straps. You have to teach them not to.
3,I dont know yet...,"I got this for my 9 month old who stil has to ride backwards. The carseat itself is really nice, but its HUGE. I have a '98 Catera, and it takes up half the back seat. It is difficult to get him in and out of the carseat, especially when he is sleeping. It takes a long time and he gets fussy. Hopefully when the seat is facing forward, it will be different, but for a backwards facing carseat, its difficult."
3,Carry On 2??,"I bought this album because bridge9.com recommended this for any fans of Carry On..myself being a huge Carry On fan decided to give these guys a chance, and to my surprise they sounded just like Carry On! Yes! Exactly like Carry On!! Even to the point where riffs they have in their songs sound stolen from other Carry On Songs hahha...compare ""And I Begin.."" to the song ""A Life Less Plagued"" or compare ""If You See.. to X's Only Win"" hell there are a lot of similarities you'll notice haha...all in all though its a good ep, but i wish they had a little bit more of their own sound in it"
4,Wish I'd bought these a long time ago,Bought these when I bought a new roasting pan. I haven't used them to lift a turkey yet but they work well on roasted pork and large hams. They are well built and clean up easy.
4,Sturdy and Attractive,"These are well made lifting forks. I've ruined a couple of other pairs of large forks lifting cooked turkeys and large roasts, but these hold up well. They're attractive and have a nice feel to them with most of the weight in the handles."
1,Not sturdy.,Not sturdy. Handle and prongs are not one piece and can potentially pull apart with use. I have owned lifters of this two piece design and the handle broke away from the prongs and could not be repaired. Just six more dollars and I could have had what I thought I was purchasing...All Clad for $28. The picture does not allow the purchaser to see that the forks are in two pieces. Returning faulty products are not easy.
4,"Nice size, well built product","I've yet to use the Poultry Lifters, but, I want to say that they are well made. The size is large enough to get the job done, but not so large that you won't find a spot to store them. I'm happy with my purchase!"
5,A stunning debut album,"A beautifully written, crafted and recorded album, which even someone of Cohn's rare talents couldn't match second time round. ""Walking In Memphis"" is magic, though not to be confused with the dreadful Cher version... this is the original and best.The vocals and piano are magical throughout the album, particularly shining on ""Silver Thunderbird"", and ""Strangers In A Car"", a deceptively haunting song, that you just have to listen to again and again...Not a party album, or one to take to the gym, but a fantastic album to relax to, and to think. Turn the lights down, open a bottle, and chill... Buy this for a loved-one or for yourself - you'll not regret it."
4,Style harkens back to the folky 70's.,Strong album both lyricaly and musicaly bathed in folk/rock roots.Lets get this fine artists work remastered as it is a must to own. Planning a wedding? The song True Companion will have all your aunts and uncles going ahhhh!
3,A heart touching album,"Ok i would like to start by saying his a great singer. He has a voice of his own, a real husky one. This CD let him down though, dont get me wrong, ""Walking in Memphis"" is one of my favorite songs,i tingle everytime i listen to it, not many songs these days can do that. But when i listen to ""walking in memphis"" i want to hop on the plane and go to memphis. His others songs like ""Ghost Train"" are good as well. But if ""walking in Memphis"" wasnt on this album, i wouldnt of bough it. The overall album didnt do him much justice."
4,pretty good,"I heard this song about a year before I bought this cd. most of the tracks are good, although only a few stand out as great."
5,Another Forgotten Best New Artist.,"I was quite pleased in 1992 when Cohn took home the Best New Artist Grammy. Then, like Tracy Chapman and Bruce Hornsby before him, he faded from memory. I've kept up with him though. I think of his three cds his debut is his best. Eleven songs that make up a memorable recording. A classic recording I think. From the opening ""Walking in Memphis"" to ""Ghost Train"", ""Silver Thunderbird"", ""Miles Away"", ""Strangers in a Car"", ""29 Ways"" and ""True Companion."" Marc Cohn shows he is a well trained musician with a knack for great pop songs. This is heard to a lesser extent on 1993's The Rainy Season and even lesser on 1998's Burning the Daze. Marc Cohn is a must have for any rock collector."
5,"If stranded on a desert island with 10 CD's, this is one.",Speaking as someone who listens to everything from George Jones to Metallica this album is a sure-fire winner. There is not a bad track on the album. Marc Cohn is a thoughful lyricist and a provacative player. A real gem!
5,LOVE IT!!!,"My husband bought this cd when it first came out. When we first started dating he had a hard time saying what he was feeling. He sat me in his room and played TRUE COMPANION for me. I will never forget that moment. 2 years later we shared another special moment - dancing to TRUE COMPANION on our wedding day. Not a dry eye in the house. Perfect cd for a romantic dinner, lazy Sunday, whatever the mood - Marc Cohn is perfect for it!"
5,his best work,"I try not to use the same old hackney descriptions in these things. Words like ""soulful"" and ""heartfelt"" I'm sure would be used to describe Marc Cohn, but let's just keep it simple...The songs on this album are not complex. They are simply and precisly arranged, and they are beautiful in that simplicity.His lyrics are clever and meaningful. This album is definately his best work. Marc Cohn's voice fits his lyrics. Sit on a pier and watch the seagulls pick little fish from between the waves of long island sound. You'll hear Marc Cohn singing in the background."
4,Marc Cohn,"Very smooth songwriter. I wish he would stick with the blues, that is where he is the best."
5,"Great voice, great album","Cohn's unique, but enjoyable voice carries this album far. With songs like ""Dig Down Deep,"" the beautiful ""True Companion"" and ""Walking in Memphis"" this recording is one you'll listen to again and again."
5,Yancey does it again!!,"As always, Philip Yancey brings us a book that is so down-to-earth and human that it is irresistable. A great book, well worth the time and money. Sure to bring joy and refreshment for anyone's spirit."
2,Don't Buy This Book,"I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them. This isn't one of those cases. I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced. I bought this book with lots of anticipation. I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents. After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book. Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts. I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation. Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR. Those would be ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and ""Disappointment with God"" (Which also was spectacular). If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's. As for ""Reaching the Invisible God,"" I wouldn't buy it."
2,God is NOT so unknowable,"I was very disappointed by this book. For the countless believers who long to know the invisible God this book offers little help. The invisible God that Yancey writes about is NO so 'unknowable'. For believers who long for intimacy with God and who like Moses yearn for more of His glory I recommend ""Revival"" by Lloyd-Jones, ""Holiness"" by J.C. Ryle, ""The Glory of Christ"" by John Owen, ""Why Revival Tarries"" by Ravenhill or anything by A.W. Tozer, Jonathan Edwards, or Richard Sibbes."
4,Great Thoughts on Building a Real Faith,"Yancey's latest journey into faith has the same honesty and reality that make all his other books a welcome remedy to many other ""Don't worry, be happy"" books on the Christian faith. There are immaculate pearls of insight in this book, and anyone with a desire to contemplate their faith - and come out feeling excited about it - will not be disappointed. My only criticism is that the book is more a dumping of great thoughts, than something that moves along with a common theme. But don't let that stand in your way. Yancey is the type of writer you'd trust with your inner doubts and anxieties. Those new to Yancey should jump first into ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" - that is a faith-changing book - but those considering buying ""Invisible God"" will likely already have that one in their library."
1,What am I missing?,"I bought this book on the strength of the recommendations posted to this site. I cannot believe the high ratings this book received. Its premises can be summarized in about two sentences. You may as well have faith in spite of pain, suffering and the injustices in the world because that beats not having faith. Secondly, as it becomes more and more difficult to justify your faith as you get older, that should be viewed in a positive, invigorating way. Give me a break. There is almost nothing here regarding an even elementary philosophical basis for the author's position. It's pretty much ""This is how I deal with faith in a world filled with pain and suffering and an invisible God that appears not to respond to anyone's prayers."" Where is this author coming from? Look elsewhere for even a beginning scholarly discussion of these difficult issues."
1,Title not appropriate,"I have not read the book, but I have a problem with the title. How many people on this planet think that God is visible? Perhaps 0.1%. Why go for such an obvious title?It's a bit like saying, 'Communicating with the Solid Earth'. 99.9% of people on this planet think that Earth is solid, therefore it is not necessary to add the word 'solid'. Sorry, but I, for one, am not tempted to read the book."
5,Powerful and Practical,"I have spent the past 5 or 6 years trying to figure out why I could no longer feel God the way I used to. I wondered what I was doing wrong, I wondered if God forgot me, or if I was wrong before and God didn't exist. This and another of Yancey's books have brought be back to a place where I can believe again that my faith is real. I almost felt as if I were reading my own hearts cries in this book. At points I even felt that it would be as hard to let a friend read this book as it would be to share my personal journal, the thoughts and doubts were so like my own! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is seeking and not really 'feeling' what they have been told they should."
5,Seemingly Perfect,The authors have combined technical information along with interesting case studies to make this textbook seemingly perfect. It is packed with a wealth of helpfull and pertinent information that will assist the security minded individual or corporation. I think this should be a required text for all criminal justice and criminal studies majors.
2,Not so great,"This item I had to buy from a separate seller, and the shipping & handling for this one item was ridiculous. The product itself was over-priced too. I think it looks awful - goofy. Good thing I bought it as a gift. I wouldn't want one."
4,The Best of Zeppelin,"I once owned (and subsequently lost) every Zeppelin album ever recorded, and I was looking to replace my collection when I saw this. All their huge hits (with one exception, see below) are here, as well as songs you probably haven't heard of, but once you listen to them, they'll be a permanent fixture on your I-pod. My mp3 player has only a paltry 2 gigs (which sounded like all the space I'd ever need when I bought it, but I've since discovered that no matter how much space you have, it isn't enough), so I couldn't fit the entire studio recordings on it, but this selection is most likely what I'd have on their. It is missing a couple good songs, as is usually the case with compilations, but while some songs such as ""Four Sticks"", ""You Shook Me,"" and the ""Lemon Song"" are forgivable, the absence of ""Good Times Bad Times"" is pretty inexcusable, hence only four stars instead of five."
5,Good ol Zep!,A nice dose of the first four classics. Outside case was alittle more worn than expected but no big deal.
1,Led Zeppelin box set review,I was expecting to receive the 4 disc Led Zeppelin box set. However I only received one disc. I was disapointed because I feel this product was misrepresented in the ad.
5,Why did I wait so long?,"After listening to my first four Led albums on vinyl since they were released, and believe me they had been partied on and well worn, I recently received this box set. Wow!! The quality of the remastering is superb. So much more to be heard than on the vinyl. So many good times to remember and so much of the music absolutely haunting. This remastering gives one the insight to how musical Led was and not all rock, but when they rocked they rocked. May their music live on forever."
3,A Beginner's Guide To Zeppelin.,"This box set is just a remastered greatest hits package plus non album tracks targeted at casual listeners. I recommend it only to Zep neophytes. However if you fancy yourself a potential hardcore fan, take the chance and shell out the bucks for The Complete Studio Recordings, you won't be sorry because it contains EVERYTHING, even the non-album tracks included here.Another reason to buy this might be to get the non-album songs when you've already invested in the albums individually..."
5,The Best of Everything,"This is everything you want in a Zeppelin collection and more. Awesome, and comes with a history book too. Excellent buy."
3,"Good Band, Not a Good CD","Led Zeppelin is an awesome band. They are probably my favourite band of all time. But, do not buy this CD. Every Led Zeppelin song is good, you need to hear them all. So, do not buy this package, buy the individual albums.For the price you're paying for this set you can almost buy 5 Led Zeppelin albums, and that is what you should really do. In my opinion, the best ones to buy would be Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of Holy, but really, the first 6 Led Zeppelin Albums are all very good (Led Zeppelin I, II, III, IV, Houses of Holy, and Physical Graffiti)."
4,Mssng Smthng,"Physical Graffiti had one of the best songs, ""Boogie with Stu"". But it seems to be mssng from the box set....Written by Ritchie Valens, and never performed by him, it was originallly called ""Ohhh my head"" which is still part of the song. I love that song!"
2,wow...hes good,"dont get me wrong i love led zeppelin and i dont mind getting some new cd's but these are not accurate cd's at all. led zeppelin I,II,III, and IV are all wrong and out of order, these are cheap knock off bad quality cd's and some songs skip. If it was more than 10 dollars than maybe i'd care alil more but w.e."
5,Unequaled in Music History,"There used to be a radio station in the Los Angeles area that had a program titled ""desert island disks"". The theory was that if you were stranded on a desert island (a la Gilligan's Island), you would select your ten favorite disks to last out the remainder of your life in musical bliss. This 4-disc boxed set eliminates the need to choose.I won't go into detail about each of the fifty-four songs here, but will say that each one is brilliant and completely unique - there is NO filler! Led Zeppelin is unequaled in talent, ability, and variety and this collection is a stunning showcase of their diverse talents.Do yourself a favor and purchase this set - you won't regret it."
3,Almost brilliant,"This boxed set is a very good representation of Led Zeppelin's total career. It catches all the highs, and unfortunately, many of the lows as well.Let's face it: their first 5 or 6 albums were great, but it was all downhill from there. So not surprisingly, the first two discs of this set are fantastic, capturing Led Zeppelin in all its creative glory. Discs III and IV, however, are padded with too much dreary filler and forgettable songs from their later years. I've owned this set for several years, and disc IV almost never finds its way into my CD player.As an overview of Zeppelin's career, it is an accurate representation. For my money, however, the first two discs are all I really needed."
3,"Great, but...","The collection of songs, themselves, contained within this set is great!!!HOWEVER, what in the heck were the bafoons thinking when they designed the case?!? It's big enough to (literally) fit 4 LP's in it!!! WHYWHYWHY not just put the bloody CD's in a nice, 4 disc capacity CD jewel case?!?Who in the world wants to tote around a 13""x13"" box around?!? MORONS!!!"
5,Zeppelin RULZ!!!,"If this dont ROCK you, you are dead or at least very, very OLD. These guys show why todays rock SUX and todays artists are wimps and have no soul. Having been born and raised in Memphis I fully understand the influence of delta blues and gospel music has had on ROCK. I saw Page & Plant in Oct. here and they havent lost ANY of the magic. It is amazing that the poorest section and people of the country gave the world the only truely soulful and meaningful music that knows no boundaries!!! From THE KING to Zepp the blues live on and the world is better for it. 2 words for the musically ignorant ROBERT JOHNSON!!!"
5,Very pleased,I was very pleased doing business with cd wharehouse. The item was just as described and arrived in the time frame they told me it would. I was just about to inquire about its where abouts when the mailman arrived with in hand. Packaging was very professional and well done.
5,A MUST for every Led Zeppelin Fan!,"This is a great compilation of songs, plus photo's and stories. If you love Led Zeppelin, you're gonna LOVE this boxed set!"
2,Late,"The order arrived 5 days late, and my emails to inquire about it went unanswered. So when it did arrive, I was a little upset. The packaging of this collection is exactly like that of an old LP collection, and I immediately thought ""Oh great, they sent the wrong media!"". But it turned out to be right. There are some minor flaws with the CDs (this is not their fault either) in that they play correctly, but iTunes could not convert 3 songs on 2 different discs. To get around the problem, I had to use another program to rip the songs to hard disk, then import them."
2,Overrated,"Is it just me , or are Led Zeppelin not all that good? I feel bad about this box set because my brother bought it for my birthday, and ther'es only a couple of songs on it I like."
2,Led Zeppelin are NOT gods.,"I am absolutely sick to death of people describing Led Zeppelin as ""gods"". Led Zeppelin were a MUSIC BAND do you understand? A music band , nothing more."
1,Led Zeppelin isn't worthy of a box set,"This recording includes 58 songs, of which only 4 can be worthy of being called box set status."
4,An old Jem,Sooooo glad I was able to find this Canadian classic on vinyl before it's extinct. Not the Doughboys best songs necessarily but the best start to finish album in their catalog.
4,excellent value,i love this olivella face & body soap. i have used this item for a year & find it to be excellent for both face & body use.
2,olivella body soap,I bought this for my feet because they are so rough while it does it's job it makes a nasty mess in your tub..
5,odorless,I purchased this soap because of the odor. It is a good soap for allergies to strong odors. It is also natural.
3,The smell is WAAAYYY too strong,"This soap has a baby powder smell to it, which I don't mind. The problem is how strong the smell is - I could smell it standing a few feet away before even opening the packing box. Since I can't vouch for the quality of the soap, I'm giving it 3 stars."
5,Truly a great soap,"I first heard about this product on QVC and found I could receive a much better deal from Amazon. The olive oil in the soap softens your skin and rinses off cleanly. In the past, I have had to use soap for sensitive skin...this soap is just as gentle. What I like the best is that it can be used on both the face and body with the same great results. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural way to cleanse and soften your skin."
5,Dry itchy skin?,For the past several years my skin had become dry and itchy. I tried many different kinds and types of soaps and lotions until a friend of mine referred me to this soap. Just after one use I felt my skin improve and after my first bar my dry and itchy skin was pretty much just a memory. This was a welcome relief. I highly recommend Olivella Face and Body Soap.
2,Offensive Smell,"This soap is really just for people with skin problems because they need pure olive oil. I found the smell of this soap to be putridly offensive. It smells like old, musty clay. I have purchased pure olive oil soaps in both Greece and Italy, and they smelled quite pleasant. I purchased this soap online in an attempt to replicate the soaps I purchased abroad, and only after reading many reviews about similar soaps. I guess I picked the wrong one. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
1,foam glider,"I would rate this in one word (JUNK),after my son try to sail it several times,it pretty much fell apart !!!"
3,Killed Concept!,"A lover of Ferril's past work, of Ben Stiller flicks, and all stupid humor-containing, SNL, Mad TV type of material, I am highly disappointed with ""Anchorman"". There were some great angle and jokes, and I did laugh. But, the pace of the story, the appearance of Tim Robbins (everyone else who showed up has a history and reason for being in a Will Ferril flick), and the terrible ending killed the party. Come on, Will!I'm also a 70's afficianado. I thought ""Starsky & Hutch"" was well-done. This whole concept of ""Anchorman"" had so much potential. Whoever green-lighted the final script ought to be sent to UPN or PAX.I'm surprised to see Christina Applegate, as talented and beautiful as she is, involved with such a terrible script.3 stars for the gags that stand on their own, though, especially the star-studded, minus one, ""anchorman rumble"" in the back alley and Applegate in skirts."
2,Save it for the 11 0'clock news,"I wanted to like this movie. Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke. Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat. The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen. Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller. All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment. Will Ferrell can do much better than this."
2,Only mildly amusing,"Will Ferrell stars as shallow, dense, and sexist San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy with Applegate as his new female competition. Burgundy comes off like a genius compared to his moronic team of sportscaster, weatherman, and featured reporter. The movie comes off as more of a satire on late 1970s big hair newscasts than a laugh out loud comedy. Only Applegate really shines. Just a so-so movie in the 2 to 2.5 star range."
3,Maybe they should have called it 'Weatherman'...,"Don't get me wrong, I liked Anchorman. But not as much as wanted to. The problem is, in a comedy your lead actor has to be the funniest person in it. Farrell was a distant 5th, and that's only because I can't remember the bartender's name.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd stole this movie handily. Then Fred Willard, who has a knack for fantastic cameo roles, takes third. Remember him in 'Best in Show', good stuff. Then Christina Applegate out performs the lead. Not the sign of a good comedy.By the way, aren't we getting a little tired of Will Farrell yet? And this may be a spoiler, but enough with Jack Black and Ben Stiller. I think we have all seen enough of Black's lame karate poses on the red carpet at premiere night.The DVD has some nice extras. The music video is okay, but the deleted scenes and blooper reel are the best extras. Unfortunately, they may be the best things on the disc, including the movie."
1,lame,this movie is lame at times annoying poor plot. the acting is usually poor. you may laugh yet more likely you will forget to as you're wondering why you wasted your time.
3,Its makes you laugh not for KIDS,Funny movie. Especially the Network anchor rumble. some clever stuff. Its a good rent.
5,cracks you up and touches you too alot,"He does a great impression of Ron Burgandythe front cover pic is hilariousthe movie is unreal in funny wayshe really cracks me upthe whole casting is hilariousCristina Applegate is a hottieand a great actressshe was hilarious in Don't tell mom the babysitter's deadand the married with children showshe and Farrell are also very heart warming in this movie together as a coupleit's a loving adorable funny storyit's funny from start to endhas some cameoskeep your eyes openi'm gonna watch this one over and over and over and laugh harder every timeit really is funnyand I'm glad I got this 4 days agowhen I saw the trailerI knew I had to get this movie on dvdit's awesomeside splitting humorodd humor at timesbut very very funnyI would recommend Elf, A night at the Roxbury and other movies if you like Will Farrell"
2,"like burns said, it had alot of potential","I waited, finally saw it and it was not as good as it could have been. It had its funny moments, but they could've done alot better...it had a great plot; a corny, sleazy 70s reporter who thought he was all that but was also cute and sensitive. And it also had Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate whom could've been ALOT better in this. And who else is sick of Ben Stiller?"
4,The problem with critics...,"The problem with critics is that they're looking for a deep movie. Of course Anchorman is a stupid movie. Of course there aren't any deep themes. This is, after all, a Will Farrell comedy. I laughed the whole way through. Will Farrell is much funnier than Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller (Dodgeball, by the way, was more popular for some reason, but also less funny). Plus, I think everyone will laugh at Steve Carrell's portrayal of the ""special"" weatherman. I will admit that Christina Applegate was not that great and the ending scenes just kind of rambled and werent as funny as the rest of the movie (kind of like in Elf).In short, if you want a deep movie, go somewhere else. If you wanna laugh all the way through, see Anchorman."
5,hahaha,"I love this movie. I bought it at a great price and it was shipped very quickly. If you have not seen it, then buy it"
3,Another goofy Will Ferrell vehicle.,"Will Ferrell has a real knack for playing clueless goofballs - in this case a conceited San Diego news anchor, circa 1977 - and he pretty much carries the movie. Christina Applegate handles the lead female role admirably, and she has matured into a real beauty, which makes it all the more enjoyable to watch her onscreen. The story line is thin, to say the least, but there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments. Worth watching if you want some light entertainment and don't mind some bad language and constant sexual innuendo."
2,Could have been better!,"Being in the broadcasting business, I can identify with most of the routines that goes on in the newsroom from this movie. On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny. It was very spotty as far as laughs. However, the script comes off prety lame. The acting was pretty obnixious and made it seem like I was going through a root canal at the dentist office. Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting lots of laughs. It could have been a much better film!"
3,so-so review for a so-so movie,"I gave this movie an ok in the middle rating because it's so-so. There were a couple of laugh out moments. I do mean just a couple. The anchorman rumble with the other networks was funny) and ""Afternoon Delight"" was funny- But nothing to write home about-/ It's a could've been type of movie, lots of places where it could've been funny but just missed."
3,NOT THE BEST....,"But watch it just to hear the non stop stream of idiocy will ferrell spews throughout. truly inspiring....p.s.Elf, not funny."
3,Good for SNL fans...,"I enjoyed Anchorman more because I am a huge Will Ferrell fan rather than because the movie was good...The movie suits Will great, because there are many chances to improvise and make it funny. It sort of reminded me of an SNL skit gone wrong, but still semi-funny just because of will. However, where the movie lacks in the comedy category it really represents the 70's accurately with the whole ""men rule the world"" type deal. It sort of shows how women anchors came to be, and it was a small step in woman having more of a say in things. With that said, i would recommend this movie for Will Ferrell fans, but do not expect to be laughing at every single scene."
3,A fistful of gags,"Will Ferrell's first big comedy after Elf won't rake in the dollars that his holiday heartwarmer did, nor is it likely to go over as well with critics, who were able to forgive Elf's schmaltzy ending due to the imaginative gags. Anchorman is a pretty funny comedy, although there is nothing much to occupy our minds as we wait for the next funny joke. The movie takes a shotgun approach, spraying us liberally with jokes to see what sticks, and enough did that I was happy walking out of the theater. The storyline is pretty simple-Ron Burgundy is a bigshot local tv anchorman in the seventies, who is so entrenched in the way that things are that he can't even conceive of an aspiring female anchor as a threat. He quickly falls in love with said aspirant Applegate, but they break up as soon as her encroachment on his professional turf is too much to ignore. Happy ending, blah blah blah."
1,"Movie is horrible, not funny, don't buy this one","Save your money, the main character is annoying. It's one of the worst comedies I have seen in a long time."
1,"Horrible, waste of time",This movie was ridiculously a waste of my time and money. I thought Will Ferrell could come up with a better script. The plotlines were boring and there were only one or two lines that actually made me laugh.Don't see this movie. Don't waste your money like I did.
1,Boring. (* 1/2),"I only went to see this movie with a freind becuase she wanted to, and I had nothing better to do. Plus, I like Christina Applegate, and I thought that it possibly *could* be funny. Well, Will Ferral was, but only occasionaly. The rest of the movie and cast wasn't. I smiled at some of the jokes, while the rest of the crowd at the theater HOWLED with laughter at every single joke, seemingly just to laugh. This is one of those stupid-humor movies like ""Scary Movie"", but not as extreme. And like ""Scary Movie"", ""Anchorman"" gets old fast, and therefore gets very boring. It throws gag after gag at you, and they just aren't funny. And Christina Applegate, while not awful, didn't seem to be putting much work into the role as the tired strong,competetive sassy women."
1,You cannot say anything bad about this movie....,"You cannot say a single thing bad about this movie.No. Seriously. If you do, Will Ferrells minions will pester you until you remove your original review. They are relentless. And for some unfathomable reason, they think that recycled SNL skits make a good movie.Honestly. This movie is so bad I cannot even work up the energy to defend my original bad review of it.Fine. Go ahead. Watch it. But be aware that every time you do you are only encouraging this kind of behavior."
4,Stupid but Funny,"Ok, I am not a big comedy person, but this was a funny movie. It is stupid, but funny. Ferrell is great at playing these kinds of characters and the huge amount of cameos in the movie keeps it entertaining. It runs out of steam towards the end, but the bloopers shown during the credits will make sure you are laughing when the movie is over. It probably isn't for everyone, but it is funny. It never tries to be anything but fun. There is a great ""West Side Story"" like rumble between news stations that borders on Monty Python funny which is saying a lot for Ferrell. You also have to love the Jack Black and Ben Stiller cameos. I wouldn't put it down for a sure Oscar winner, or even my favorite movie, but it is worth a 3 buck rental."
2,"Good idea for a spoof, shallow script. Poor female lead.","I wanted to like this film, I enjoy Will ferrell's work, but-----this film just doesn't cut it. Paul Rudd as the macho Geraldo like reporter is very good, (talking about how he was ""in love"") and Ron Burgendy says: ""I don't think that's love."" etc..... so there are some good moments in the movie. Christina Applegate was a big drag on the film for me. She did not have the sexual chrisma that shows up on camera. She's pretty enough, but she does not have what it takes for the big screen. All in all, now worth any more time."
2,"A Few Good Laughs, But Was It Worth It?","Overall, I didn't think the movie was very funny. I love Will Ferrell, but he's definitely had better movies. There were a couple of very funny parts, but everything in between was a little dull and bland."
5,I'm Ron Burgundy?,"A job well done by Farrel and the Crew! It is great seeing them all working together--Stiller,Vaughn,Farrel,Curell--and is quite enjoyable. (If you like this try Starksy and Hutch)"
5,"""Do you wanna come to the pants party with me?""","Stupid. Puerile. Stilted. Broad. And all the better for it.I rented this when it first came out. I didn't laugh much. It really did nothing for me.But my girlfriend and I kept throwing lines from the film at one another for weeks afterwards and cracking each other up. (I should have known then).A few years later I caught it again on cable and ended up on the floor. This movie was the impetus for a new rule in my life. I now give almost all comedies (at least ones with a cast like this one) a second chance. Sometimes your mood changes things so dramatically.This movie is so chocked full of priceless lines it's ridiculous. Others have gone on about them in detail, so I won't bother. But just thinking about this movie makes me laugh.Check your inner adult at the door and go along for the over-the-top trip back to a 1970's that never was. Indulge in every possible myth and stereotype, and don't forget to bring your jacuzzi trunks and a flute."
3,Funny Movie - Laugh Quite A Lot,This is a super funny movie. Will Ferrell always delivers : ) Anchorman is the kind of stupid funny throughout the whole movie that just causes you to involuntarily giggle. The plotline is so oddball and funny that you can't help but be entertained. The plotline is interesting. I like to watch any movie with Will Ferrell in it. He doesn't really ever let me down. Like this movie! Good entertainment for a day of movie watching!
4,ONLY Will Ferrell movie I like,"I had caught this film on pay cable when it came on in 2005.Surprised me I liked it.At the time of release, it was original idea for a film I thought.It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated.The cast were perfect in their roles. Did NOT need Luke Wilson though. Unnecessary. And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.Now, the DVD package it's.I expected more since it is a ""Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!"".1. Has those HORRIBLE little flaps tat are a pain & terrible to have to open up.2. NO chapter search list or any information on the film inside.Good soundtrack for the film"
5,hillarious,"This is one of will ferrells best movies, thi movie is hillarious it down right funny, if you have'nt seen it then you should"
1,A good sketch does not a good movie make.,"I had heard the negative reviews, but I went into this with an open mind and no expectations. I guess if I had to review it in one sentence it would be:I didn't laugh once.I'm not even all that sure why it wasn't funny. It had Will Ferrell, a potentially funny story, and lots of good supporting actors and cameos. And yet, not even a chuckle.*flush*What was that? Christina Applegate's ""illustrious"" career going down the toilet."
1,"A comedy that could have been funny, but isn't.","When i caught this on HBO the other day, i was thinking it was going to be halarious. That is, until i was about five minutes into it and was already annoyed. Its weird because this is a movie that has all the funny actors in it, and the jokes are so lame and stupid that it ends up being a big waste of talent for all of them. Unless you are into stupid movies like Bio-Dome..don't waste your time on this hideous comedy. You'll be thanking me later."
1,no script no humor no fun,"this movie is a embarrassment to the movie industry, it looks like someone got a bunch of drunks together in 70's outfits and filmed it, it may have seemed funny at the time but when you wake up the next day it looks stupid on film, dont buy this! anything on TV is better than this!!"
1,At A Loss for Words,"Except for the word ""stupid"". This movie was mind-numbing stupid!! Several reviewers have commented on Ferrell's style of ""humor"", but they could have pulled some passing schmuck from his car to do this script, and that schmuck would have done better than Ferrell. There were maybe 4 scenes which pulled a passing chuckle, but the rest of the movie was a black hole. Now, Jim Carrey might have been able to rescue this film's sucky plot, but not Mr. Ferrell; the poor dude came off looking like an absolute moron. This DVD will be useful only for target practice."
1,Anhorman dvd,"I bought this DVd for my partner for his birthday , it didnt work in any of our dvd players and we have fairly new ones that cover all regions. then when i looked up a contact to try to return it , this proved hard within itself so gave up - so my experience with Amazon and the dvd was very average and poor."
1,Appauling,"I bought this movie after watching Elf. Elf was outstandingly good. This piece of garbage was terrible from the start. Unfunny. And terrible gross out humor. If you like to watch trash, this movie is for you. Christina Applegate was misused. Horrific picture. Don't walk but run from this movie."
1,MINUS 5 STARS - it was that bad!,"I would rate this flick a MINUS 5 STARS if I could. It was total waste of film. DO NOT purchase, DO NOT borrow, DO NOT even bother to rent ANCHORMAN - you will be spending too much money and wasting time! My husband and I could not believe the positive reviews this got on your site. There were actually a handful of people who found something entertaining in this? Hmmmmm this is right up there with the all time worst films ever created. Given the choice of watching it again OR catching the FLU, the FLU would win HANDS DOWN!"
2,"I waited, and waited, and waited for it to be funny.","Wow. What awful dreck. As the title says, I waited for it to be funny. Just a little bit. One joke or humorous situation, but nope.This is a complete waste of Will Ferrell's talent. Even Steve Carrell wasn't funny, and that surprises me the most.I'm glad that I only rented it (on Amazon Instant Video,) but I think someone owes me a refund anyway."
4,wat?,"i dont know why so many people are sayin this is a bad movie. i thought this was a hilarious movie to start with, but then you have a cast of will ferrell, vince vaughn, ben stiller, and even jack black, how can you go wrong?!? this was clearly will ferrell at his best. i recommend this movie to anybody that has liked snl or will ferrell, hilarious!!!"
3,Not as funny as Will Ferrell can be,"I had a chance to check out ""Anchorman"" not too long ago. I didn't have too high expectations, though I'd heard good things about it. Well: the movie left me scratching my head. It sure had some funny moments, but for the most part it reminded me of how boring of an experience watching ""Old School"" was: thematically, it was lame, and it made me wonder how good a comedian can Will Ferrell be, while continuing to pull off such bad movies. I won't recommend it, not even if you have nothing else to do on a weekend night."
2,A waste of a cast,"Anchorman isnt funny at all. SNL is better than this trash. So much talent is wasted on unfunny, misogynistic jokes. A Hollywood disgrace."
5,"Side spliting laughter--miserable, boring people won't enjoy",I just came back from Anchorman. It is one of the funniest movies of the year. NO it isn't highbrow but it is funny.If you like:WaterboyDumb and DumberOld SchoolThen go see it now!If you like:The NotebookAntiques Road ShowSeventh HeavenStill go and see Anchorman...you need to get a sense of humor.
2,NOT THAT FUNNY,"A silly goofball comedy set somewhere in TV's dark ages of two decades ago, ""Anchorman"" is about a San Diego TV news anchor (Will Farrell) who is also a self-aggrandizing, chauvenistic simpleton with a nice voice and a good mustache. His world is rocked by the new feminist reality when a pretty female anchor (Christina Applegate) takes up space at the once all male desk.Farrell's OK as the pompous Bergundy but is nowhere near his inspired and sympathetic ""Elf"" character.There are 22 deleted scenes in the nearly one hour of extras. Highlights are Burgundy's conversation with Bill Curtis for the ""Radio and TV Hall of Fame"" and his disastrous ESPN job interview.The nearly uncensored, exceedingly crude, sophomoric but sometimes funny commentary track for this special edition is NOT for kids or the faint of heart."
3,Alright movie,My husband liked this movie much more than I did. I found it a little to raunchy in the language department and a bit on the dumb side.
2,unrated cut some of the funny stuff from the real movie,"I was so disappointed on the unrated, uncut version of anchorman. some of the changes made, replaced some of the funniest portion of the movie. if i knew about this i would either have not purchased the movie or see if the real movie is on the regular dvd and purchased that instead."
5,Great movie! Laughs and Laughs,My husband watches this movie over and over. He laughs continuously each time. :-)
4,Funny,"After watching this movie, I am still laughing about it. It is not meant to tell a great story, or be thought provoking it is just a movie to make you laugh. It did its job and made me as well as the entire audience in the theater I was at laugh. Will Ferrell gave a great performance, he never fell out of charachter and the appearnces from Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller were great. Go see this movie with an open mind and it will be great trip to the movies."
2,Not happy,"I was very dissapointed in this movie. I was so looking forward to seeing it and I am a huge Will Ferrell fan, but this movie was so dry and terrible. I got a few chuckles throughout the movie but that was it. If you really want to see it, don't waste your money, wait until it come out on video. I am sure it will be soon."
3,Spoiled Burgundy,"Will Ferrell is an acquired taste. You either get it or you don't. Much of what he does in ""Anchorman"" reminds me a lot of Bill Murray's moves; but Murray's moves one step removed. Ferrell's shtick is a hit and miss situation: sometimes it works, other times not.Nonetheless, there are a couple of hilarious scenes in ""Anchorman"": the ""Westside Story"" meets ""Braveheart"" hand-to-hand combat scene between all the San Diego News teams is one. Also, Christina Applegate is smart, sexy and pretty and more to the point she is becoming quite the accomplished comedic actress.Ultimately, ""Anchorman"" is not as smart, funny and witty that it thinks it is...but hey---maybe that's the point."
2,Over the Top,"There are some gags that are hilariously funny, but the plot doesn't hang together. There are too many over-the-top scenes. This strategy works for Mel Brooks, but here Ferrel takes potshots at everything and pretty much misses everything. For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.The movie just doesn't work for me."
2,"A Great Movie, A Lousy DVD","I wish I bought the regular version. This ""unrated version"" was not as good as the theatrical release, but the DVD commentary was rude, crude, and nothing to do with the movie. Will Ferrell and Adam McKay spend time coming up with worse and worse swear words to see how much gets bleeped (a lot of it). Nothing about the movie was discussed at all. It was insulting."
2,mediocre comedy!,"definitely not Will Ferrell's best effort. If you are expecting something along the lines of ""old ""school"" you will be dissapointed. There are some laughs but they are few and far between. The one plus is the adorable Christina Applegate!"
2,Embarrassingly Dumb,"The 70's satire is a nice try, but the jokes are overdone, and the end product just falls flat. The ""boy's club"" mantality of the all-male anchor desk is done in humor that would make a 12 year old boy proud, and never really gets beyond it. There is little plot, instead relying on a series of sight gags and weird plot devices (like a gang rumble between the guys from every anchor desk in San Diego). The best line in the whole movie was at the very end when the narrator gave the ""this is where they are now"" speech. Brick, the 50 I.Q. weather man was a top advisor in the Bush Administration. It was the best line in the whole movie."
3,"Will Ferrell shines again in a very funny ""Anchorman""","I generally have two reactions to Will Ferell movies either I fall out laughing hard or wonder why did he do this movie, Well Anchorman is a very funny romp through the 70's (the decade that bad taste in clothing begat)as a sexist but charming Anchorman who falls in love with Veronica Corningstone a ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate who's becoming the Myrna Loy of our generation)after she joins the station in hopes to improve ""diversity'. With dialouge that people will be quoting years for years afterward. It's a good movie for laughs and the cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller and others and the outright silliness It's a good escape movie."
3,"When it's funny, its hilarious. When it's not . . .","This is a scattershot comedy that ended up frustrating me. The parts that were funny, had me laughing until I couldn't breathe and the parts that didn't work had me looking at my watch waiting for them to move on. The basics are Will Ferrell plays a 70s era local news anchorman who is very popular and works and parties with his crew: weatherman, sports reporter and field reporter. Christina Applegate arrives as a beautiful young reporter trying to move in on what has been a male-only broadcast. This was a lot like a Monty Python movie in that it seemed more like a group of sketches loosely tied together to try to make a coherent movie. In this case when it works it's extremely funny and clever. But when it doesn't, it's just stupid."
1,horridly bad,"I'm a fan of low-brow humor just as much as anyone, but low-brow still needs to be FUNNY and entertaining. This is just stupid humor, not low-brow. Stupid as in ""not funny,"" and you will be amazed by how many jokes fall totally flat in this borefest of a movie. I like Will Farrell, but man, he totally flops when he does his obvious ad-libbing with his dog...or with anyone. I was rolling my eyes through the movie a lot. I easily vote this the worst movie from 2004."
1,Wake me when it's over...,"I keep waiting for a movie starring Will Ferrell that makes me laugh but I haven't found it yet. I think he is perhaps one of the most overrated comedic actors of this time. I figured I'd give this movie a try because it was on HBO and there was nothing else on. Boy, am I glad I didn't waste 8 bucks at the theater. Alright, I admit I laughed at a few scenes but I don't think Will Ferrell was even in those scenes. I'm sick of previews telling me ""this is the funniest movie of the year"" and then not delivering. It is very sneaky and underhanded. Don't even waste your time with this ""comedy""."
1,This couldn't have been worse,"I was sooo excited watching the previews for this movie. I thought that the anchorman character and Will Ferrell fit like a glove...Instead it fit like OJ's glove.This movie stinks. The humor was left out along with, plot, style and basic entertainment. I cannot remember being so bored during a comedy movie, and especially during a movie with Will Ferrell. Usually all this guy has to do is talk and I'm smiling. Not the case in this movie.I'm not going to get into the plot of this movie, because I don't think it would persuade anyone to watch the movie. That is also not my intent in writing this review. I want people to lower their expectations of this movie. Maybe that will give it a chance. I will admit, I had high expectations and I fell on my face with this one.Ferrell fans..regardless of what I say, you will watch this movie.Anyone else...rent ""Elf"" instead. At least that movie is good."
1,Childish,"A very silly overacted and poor attempt at comedy! I guess it was supposed to poke fun at the traditional anchorman, but it was way off the mark to the point of being stupid."
1,Is Will Ferrell...,"...supposed to be funny? Loud, obnoxious, and funny can be hilarious like Jim Carrey or Eddie Murphy. Loud, obnoxious, and completely unfunny can be painfully excruciatingly, agonizing to watch like Will Ferrell and Jack Black. Saw the first hour of this movie surprised I made it that long."
1,Root canal or this movie? I think I'll go with the root canal...,"This movie was horrific. The only thing that shocks me more than the fact someone actually approved the making of this movie is that there are reviewers on Amazon that actually liked it! You must be joking (actually that thought is funnier than anything I saw in the movie). I like good comedy scenes and I like Will Ferrell, but only one of them showed up for this movie. Save your money and your time - trust me on this."
1,stoooooooooooopid!!!!,"Sometimes DUMB is funny - here it's mostly just plain DUMB. Definitely in the top 10 of the ""worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see""..."
1,Anchorman DVD movie,I rented this movie over New Years weekend. It was so bad I fast forwarded it in parts to get to the end to see what happens. I didn't think most of it was funny . I thought it was a comedy as it was advertised as such. There might be a couple lines you could laugh at. I would not recommend it for anyone under the teen years. Some of the comedy revolves around sex and attitudes. Over all I believe I wasted my rental fee and I am glad I didn't buy the movie.
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman excels only in proving that people find stupidity funny for its own sake; the movie's appeal stems largely from lines like ""I love lamp"" which have no inherent humor value unless one is a 12-22 year-old male."
2,I could have done without,"I watched this movie at a friends request and honestly I could have done without it. The story itself was interesting, but with most Ferrell movies they throw various things in there that have NO reason to be there.I love comedy movies, but I had a hard time finishing this movie..."
2,"A Few Laughs, Little Else","I loved ELF and thought it was a perfect vehicle for Will Ferrell. But it had a story.ANCHORMAN plays like a scattershot series of sketches. There are some laughs (some of them good ones), but the movie never comes together."
4,"Stay Sassy, Amazon!!!","I am a big Will Ferrell fan! REALLY BIG!!! I enjoy just about every one of his movies, with the possible only exception of ""Night at the Roxbury."" But this is no ""Night..."" and Will Ferell is no ordinary comedian. He is, quite easily one of the funniest men on the face of this earth.I like this movie, because it really doesn't take itself seriously, which is just fine by me, and describes Will Ferrell's lifestyle as well.Call him what you will, I call him a genius!Two hard thumbs up!Stay Sassy, San Diego!MC White said: Check it out!!!"
2,"Funny sometimes, but mostly simple minded sexist humor","I went to this movie with mediocre expectations, and was disappointed. There were a few laughs, but half way through the movie I found myself wondering if there were not a better place to be spending my time. Another SNL skit turned to movie length when it deserved 10 minutes."
2,excrement,I always thought of will ferrell as a supporting character from his time on SNL where I loved some of his work but I never saw him as being capable of carrying a lead role. Anchorman vindicated this view. I couldn't sit through the whole thing it was simply too dumb. not funny dumb just dumb. I honestly felt cheated of my rental fee. I would recommend old school if you need a ferrell fix but this was just crap.
4,Don't Buy this because it is unrated,"This was a very funny movie, but I couldn't even tell it was unrated. It did not add raunchy, funnier and cruder scenes, which I had hoped. But even without that it is still pretty funny."
1,Terribly Disappointing - Not Funny at All,"I love Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell and all of the others in this movie. These are people who can be funny just standing around. On top of it all, it sounded like a great premise with plenty of opportunity for big laughs. Unfortunately, this movie produced no more than 3 mild chuckles from me. We watched every minute of the movie, including the bloopers just hoping for one actual laugh ... only to be completely denied. I am not a difficult person to please when it comes to comedy and I have to say it was the worst movie I have ever seen. DO NOT waste your money on buying this movie. If you insist on seeing it for yourself rent it or borrow it from a friend, but you will regret spending money on it."
1,Waste of time. Only a few funny scenes,"I love Will Ferrell, honestly I do. But this movie was insulting to his career. Stupid and in some parts pointless, I watched the first hour and then had to shut it off. Just a dumb movie. Sorry, Will & fans."
1,Amazingly Poor,"Like some other readers here, I'm amazed at the dichotomy of those who absolutely love this movie and those who can't stand it. Put me in the latter category. This truly is sketch comedy at its worst, extended to feature length and including as many diversions and distractions as the director and writers could conjure. Don't label me a fuddy-duddy for not falling for this garbage. And obviously, when you make 1000 attempts at a joke, one or two of them will succeed on some level. There were some chuckles, but no big screaming laughs here.This movie scraped the bottom of the barrel, and shows yet again indeed how hard it is to make a funny movie. It's certainly more than pasting ideas together and crossing your fingers, like the crew did here. I DID find the out-takes funny; but then again, I always enjoy them..."
1,Is this movie for real??,"I did not enjoy this movie at all. The storyline is very thin, the story itself is not interesting. The actors did what they could with the material. I'm very glad that I didn't see this in the theatre because I considered ""walking out"" while watching it at home."
5,"Yep, I peed in my pants.","I was strongly objecting while this movie was being popped in the DVD player, but I completely changed my tune about 15 minutes in. The last few Will Ferrell movies I saw were fairly stinky; this one was a definite improvement.If you've heard people spouting out random quotes that make no sense, they probably came from this movie. ""I love lamp"", ""I'm kind of a big deal"", ""Loud Noises!"", ""Pants Party"", and ""Welcome to the Gun Show"" are just a few that sent us into hysterics.If you've EVER thought Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, or the majority of SNL skits were funny then you'll probably enjoy this film."
4,Side Splitting Laughs... And A Plot Too!,"Oh my gosh... what a hilarious movie!! I could not stop laughing throughout the entire film. Will Ferrell was funny but the guy on his news crew were even funnier. The story is about Ron Burgundy (Ferrell). He is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other ""female"" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. Must See!!!!"
1,What happened?,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and was very let down. Great cast and premise, but did not live up to the possibilities. Watch Old School again instead of this."
1,Will Ferrell on the down note,"I'm a Will Ferrell fan and looked forward to this movie. This is a bad movie. A very amatuerish screenplay where none of the jokes work. Many of his friends from Old School join him but it doesn't help. A fantasy fight scene including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Jerry Stiller and Tim Robbins is so contrived it's painful. And a talking dog to help through the terrible plot? The only bright spot is a very attractive Christina Applegate who never looked better.Trust me, I'm saving you money. Wait for it to come on TV. This is a weak movie as viewed by a fan."
2,ANCHORMAN Tells A Weak Story,"It stars the hilarious Will Ferrell, is co-anchored by the gorgeous Christina Applegate, features cameos by buddies Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson, and the story is about the television profession, in which I've worked for many years. Yet, somehow, the lead story never hooked me. As it is often the case with news promos, it stands true for the trailer: The story sounds riveting until you see the final piece. The moments of adlib are quite funny, but too much of the film strays away from its original point. Had the script continued to focus more on the job and less on the love connection, I think the film makers would have had better results. I am, however, glad to see the lovely Miss Applegate in a role that proves she has more talent than her ""dumb blonde"" typecast. All in all, wait to rent ANCHORMAN, preferably on a ""slow news"" night."
5,Required viewing,"Required viewing for anyone who has not seen this and is under 30. I bought a used version of the DVD and was really pleased with the outcome. The first version was scratched, and Amazon gladly provided a new used version which was, thankfully, not scratched.As for the movie, obviously awesome, as well as the source of many costumes for parties throughout the years.Now if only Amazon sold sex panther."
1,Stupid,Watched about 20 minutes to a half hour of the movie. It was so stupid. A bunch of pigs hit on this woman and sound like idiots.
5,"Dumb, Immature But Funny!","Yes I'll admit this wasn't one of Will Farwell's best films, certainly not better than OLD SCHOOL, however somehow I found this film extremely funny at times. Perhaps seeing it in a theater with more than 200 people and there was some social pressure to laugh, but I found the character Ron and his fellow news men, especially the wheather guy who was particularly dumb to be hilarious. Sure the script was sophomorish but I didn't go out to see this film with the expectation that it would be anything else."
2,Wasted talent,"i wet my pants watching the Best of Will Ferrell Saturday Night Live, but this movie just stunk. Another SNL movie that would be great as a recurring sketch, but quickly wears thin as a movie. Even a great cast couldn't save it."
2,"This movie has no ""Anchor""",I was disappointed in this movie. Ron Burgundy gets so tiring after like the first 20 minutes that it is hard to even watch this movie all the way through. I thought Christina Applegate's character was funny and the guy who was slow was funny in the part where he was yelling just becaue everyone else was yelling. But the rest of the movie was a bore. I just couldn't believe such great actors would stoop so low to do this movie. Not something I would own or even put myself through watching again.
4,Great movie,"If you haven't seen Anchorman but like Will Ferrell then you should see this movie. If you hate Will Ferrell then I would probably pass. The commentary is pretty terrible, but all the other features are great. A good commentary track would have been nice which is why it's only 4 stars for me."
5,I laughed so hard I thought I would hurt myself,"This movie is a commedy and it really delivers. He is such a dork that it is so funny. I normally do not laugh uncontroably like that at movies in public, but I was laughing so much I literally was in pain. this movie is great. It is really silly and stupid, but this comedy is outstanding. a++++ this is real comedy."
2,For Farrell fanatics only,"Will Farrell plays a sexist 70s news anchorman. Christina Applegate his competition. Sounds funny. Has some laughs. But it's really not one of his best. Only worth watching if you've already seen Old School, Talladega Nights, or pretty much any of the rest of his movies. He's done so much better elsewhere."
2,Wasnt As Bad As I Thought It Would Be.,"I just had no interest at all in watching this one; I just didn't think I could stand Will Ferrel again after I suffered through ""Elf"". But for a measly $2 a rental around here, I figured I'd grab a bunch that I didn't wanna see, because the ones I really have wanted to see have been crap, and I figured the ones I didnt wanna watch would probably become new found favorites.Well, this is by far NOT a new found favorite, but it was OK and seeing as how I was thinking it would probably be one I'd turn off after 30 minutes, it survived a whole screening from me.The humor is a little weak through a lot of the movie, but some parts got me laughing.Just a rental/wait for TV imo.The high point is what Will says to San Deago that results in him getting fired. The low point is there is a small scene with Ben Stiller. I rolled my eyes and nearly puked, is there any non-stoner comedies made in the past few years that doesn't have him in it?"
1,Blah. Almost cute but....hmm. And not a 'cruelty free' product.,"I kept waiting for the movie to get better, but, finally shut it off at the part where the biker kicks the jerky anchorman's little dog off a bridge....THAT'S supposed to be funny? Pretty bad."
1,Terrible,"This is worse then a really bad SNL skit. It's a one joke exercise in lame unfunny movie making. If you want to see the 70s lampooned in a funnier, smarter way get the Ben Stiller Starsky and Hutch remake."
1,vry corny that funny,"I didn't have alot of expectations&that was a good thing.the film like so many of recent time try to get back into the 70's&use a Soundtrack of Songs to reflect the time period but do it all in a bad party kind of way which never gets fully off the ground.I didn't find this film that much interesting at all.there were a couple of aight funny moments,but it's pretty forgettable."
1,"This movie was so bad, I fell asleep","But my wife stayed up for the whole thing, and confirmed its movie-wide suckatude."
1,im gonna save you some money,"this is the lamest movie iv seen in a few years, anybody who gives it more than 1 star must be one of the actors in the movie or something because believe me its that bad."
1,Silly,"I do not doubt Sokolov's technical mastery, but I find this recording simply too idiosyncratic. For the same reason, I am definitely not a Glenn Gould fan. If you enjoy listening to Sokolov, get this album. If you want to listen to Bach wiithout having the persona and eccentricity of the pianist intrude on what you're listening to, look elsewhere. The staccato style of his playing is not in the least bit interesting -- it's simply distracting and annoying. At times I'm not sure if I'm listening to Bach or to Count Basie. This is a wondrously deep and profound piece of music. Sokolov makes it sound silly. A waste of an obviously great talent and a very good quality recording. (I love Count Basie by the way, but not as interpreter of Bach!)"
3,Nice watch just very bulky,"Freestyle makes a nice watch, but it is bulky and heavy. Very similar in size to the timex ironman. At $25, it is a good alternative to the $40 timex."
5,Let's hear it for individuality,"This is a great tool to teach the merits of free thinking, creativity and individuality. The words and illustrations speak to children and adults. Each time you read the book you'll find something new."
2,weird audio,"i dont know what they did to the dvd because the VHS tape (which i no longer have right now) sounds normal. the dvd on the other hand sounds slower, and low pitched. so i don't know exactly what happened in the converting room to making this a dvd but someone messed up. i am not pleased with my purchase, this sounds nothing like the VHS or the soundtrack. it should not be this low or this slow......."
1,Disappointment from Cirque,"I am a dedicated Cirque fan, experiancing the delights of O, Alegria, Varekai, and Dralion. I recently saw Quidam on TV and was extremely disappointed that I sat and wasted 3 hours of my life in front of the TV for that. This annoying little girl never quits singing, and nothing very entertaining happens through the entire performance. If you want to become a huge Cirque Du Soleil fan, my advice is to not watch this one first, because it will spoil it for you. The best would be to go and see O (or Mystere) live in Las Vegas before anything."
4,Unbelievable!,"I was spell-bound watching this for the first time. Although there are some not-so-exciting as other sections, the majority of the acts are unbelievable. What a grand mix of physical beauty, strength, flexibility and art! The best has to be a toss-up between the ""scarf dance"" by the solo acrobat and the couple doing the most amazing lift moves. The musical background is so well written in that it matches the visual routines.If you want visual stimulation with an appreciation for the fine arts, then this is a MUST! Having a history in gymnastics and music performance, I never tire from seeing this DVD over and over again and again."
3,I'm still not sure if I like it or not,"This Cirque de Soleil is very different from any other I've seen. It is very dark. The costumes are gothic, the music is beautiful, but sad, and the acts, while fantastic, are done with no smiles or enthusiasm. The theme is to explore our society's isolationalism, and while that is an interesting theme, it makes for a depressing circus show. There are, as always, some amazing acts, but they are done in this dark, depressing way. My son liked it, but I liked the other shows much better."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"Once again, Cirque Du Soleil transcends, astounds, enraptures. The performances are intriguing and magnificent, unique and unbelievable, and all are saturated with a surreal quality that keeps your eyes locked onto the screen. I have one complaint. The camera frustrates me TERRIBLY during many of the performances with swinging lenses that nauseate, close-ups that are so close you might as well have your eyes closed for all you can see, and shots of an audience member during the best three seconds of an act! The effect of the German Wheel is completely ruined by a camera that rolls and spins and whips around. In the future I hope the shows are filmed with a steady, level view so that the acts can be seen clearly and in their entirety as they should be!"
2,My Personal Opinion of Quidam,"I will try to make this relatively short. I have seen a few performances of Cirque du Soleil on DVDs and TV. Quidam was filmed in Amsterdam and it shows more of an artsy performance then one I figured I would get with Cirque du Soleil. Also, the performance is subtitled in English (and a variety of other languages) which makes it more difficult to follow and watch. Overall, I did not like it too much. I labored through much of the performance wanting it to be over. The other few DVDs and shows I have seen had much more comedy and breaks in the performance. Quidam showed a very different view of Cirque du Soleil."
2,"Fairly entertaining, but not a rush...","I'm a great fan of CdS, and most of their DVDs are outstanding. But IMHO Quidam rates 4/10. Any other CdS DVD I've ever watched, any other, is substantially better, some are 10/10. But this isn't their best production by any stretch, again, IMHO. Smoke it if you've got it but don't go out of your way for this installment."
3,"Good concept, however...","My son loves doing our workout... for about the first 10 minutes than he loses interest. The workout itself is pretty good - hitting on every major muscle in 30 minutes. However, 30 minutes to a baby/toddler is an eternity and I don't think they have a long enough attention span. Even in the video, the moms continually switch babies. I still think the best bet is to join a health club that offers babysitting."
2,Cute But Not Effective,"Although this workout video is very cute to watch and I can appreciate that it is demonstrated by regular moms, if you have any intention of really getting back into shape this is not the right video. I think this video is really for someone who was not exercising at all before they were pregnant and who wants to get a really slight workout (more than nothing) while playing with her kids. It won't get you in shape. If you want to really get fit, buy another video. This was 14 bucks down the drain for me."
5,It worked for me,"This video may be low budget, but that is part of the charm for me. I was still very overweight a year after I had my first child, so I bought this video and the Workout with Baby video that goes with it. I lost 40 pounds in a month and a half using this video at least once a day. It was like working out with seriously non-judgemental friends. When the workout provided was no longer sufficient by itself, I started jogging and swimming with my child as well.I have another child now and a plethora of workout tapes, dvds, a health club membership, and yet I find myself drawn to working out with this friendly group once again."
5,An Instant Classic,"I took a chance and bought this album without hearing anything from it. Sometimes that can be disastrous. In this case, it was magic. Discordance Axis are amazing. The speedness of their play and the tones they can create are outstanding. I would highly recommend this album to anyone interested in the tone of distrted guitar and screaming vocals. These guys are awesome."
1,this printer is junk,"I bought the Lexmark X2250 printer for an extra $50 with a computer system purchase. I did not expect a great printer at that price, but this item is junk. It is not worth even $50. It is extremely noisy, slow, consumes ink like crazy, and makes horrible scans. If you do not use it regularly, the ink cartridges dry out in no time. And they are not cheap to replace.This was my first Lexmark printer and it will be my last. No matter how tempting the offer, do not waste money on this product."
2,bad printer,"This printer is really slow and it consumes way too much ink and plus the ink is very expensive. The scans and copies are below average and its basicly a waist of money. oh and its noisy to. The only thing i like about it is it tells you on the screen when the printing starts, finishes, the ink is low etc."
1,Don't waist your money,I bought this product and it did not even make it through its original cartrage.. No satifaction from Lexmark.. Its not worth the price of shipping..
4,Good food mill for those who don't use it often.,"I've only used it to make apple sauce. I'm impressed with it efficiency. It's a little difficult to take apart and put together the first few times but once you have it figured out, it's easy. When it,s apart for cleaning, there are no stubborn cleaning ares. The broad base allows it fit over most bowls and pots. A good value for the occasonal user."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","I bought this for home made tomato sauce after reading the positive reviews on Cooks Illustrated, and on first use was immediately disappointed. The item is flimsy and did not effectively process canned whole tomatoes. After about 20 minutes of struggle, my wife walked in and said ""oh, I have an old one of those from my grandmother"". She dug out of the garage an ancient Moulinex metal food mill that must have been at least 40 years old and it worked beautifully. Sadly, these appear to no longer be available, but I can't recommend this model at all. I'll give it a shot for applesauce or mashed potatoes, but am not optimistic. It gets two stars primarily because it was relatively inexpensive. For what it's worth, I've made several purchases based on Cooks Illustrated recommendations and this is the first one that I haven't been happy with."
4,Glad I bought it.,I just recently purchaased this food mill and have used it several times to make applesauce and cranberry sauce. Works great.
2,Very cheap and not well made,"I really was confused by all the great reviews for this product. It is a plastic piece of junk. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a more high-end model. I tried to made tomato sauce with this and had to keep pushing the tomatoes through the grates myself. It made a big mess and kept moving all over the place. The spinning piece that pushes the food through the grates scraped against the grate, as well, and tiny shards flaked off into my tomatoes. I would return this item, but I had it for a few months before I tried it. I will definitely try something more substantial for my next food mill."
2,Disc scrapes plastic,"Although it does seem sturdy as the other reviews noted, the metal discs scrape into the plastic container and I am terrified that little plastic shards will get into the baby food I am preparing!I returned it after the first use."
2,piece of flimsy garbage,This item does not work well at all. It is very cumbersome to use and doesn't grind your food all the way as there is always a little space between the two plates. Save your money and buy a blender.
2,Very strange.,This book included ideas such as everyone taking their baths in a wading pool outside to save on water and electricity! It also had many ideas on how to spend a lot of money on vitamins and bread mixers and wheat grinders. Great if you really like to do those things though not exactly some- thing that would simplify life for a busy mom!
3,"Little House on the Prairie in upscale Glen Ellyn, IL","Although Jackie is an engaging writer who draws one in quickly, I found several of her ideas rather outlandish. A family can save money in ways that doesn't involve such time consuming methods, however romantic they may seem. However, I appreciated her frequent reference to Biblical principles and the general values she was trying to convey. Simplified living is attained, in actuallity, alot more simply that this author leads one to believe. Still, an interesting read."
3,Thinly disguised advertisement,"Despite her claim of seeking to go beyond commercialism into a richer, fuller family life, Jackie Wellwood includes a variety of advertisements into her text. Two of these advertisements are for her own company, a fact she does not disclose. The final words of the main text would allow an astute and alert reader to pick up the reference, however she should have still made the connection clear. This lapse is so distasteful that it renders the rest of her work suspect - the reader always wonders if Wellwood is making a recommendation based on its quality or that the enterprise is owned by a friend."
4,interesting period drama,when i first started reading this book-i didn't know what to expect. araminta is such a interesting heroine. her journey from a comfortable dairy to a a rather dangerous one is well told . while the romance is conventional-the last line of the novel makes it sweet and endering. the novel ends rather dramatically and suddenly . one whishes Lofts had written a sequel .
4,A lesson worth remembering!,"This movie reminds us to focus on what is really important. Those who have sensitive hearts, will definitely need the tissue box. For others, I think you will still be left with a lot to think about."
4,The mask,"Both my husband and I thought this was a good movie. The acting by Mr. Fox was excellent. He played a man who was labeled ""mentally slow"" and he did it with such respect to the character. The movie had lessons that we can take from it. We cannot judge others by what we see on the outside, because inside they could have qualities that we never get to see because we never take the time to know them. We will watch this movie again, it was well worth the price."
4,recommended; worth watching,"i liked: the story line was interesting and entertaining. good characters, good acting. many examples of biblical values; forgiveness, love, kindness, gentleness, redemption, acceptance, tolerance. i disliked: the mild profanity here and there; all but that of james jones (based on a true story) was unnecessary. not for pre-teens, little ones, or your church library."
3,good heart warming movie,"i watched this movie cause fox was in it and didint he play a good part, i love true story and this was a great film even made me cry."
3,Good Movie - don't fulfill my expectations,"Because of a review I read, I expected more from this movie! Novertheless I think it is a good movie. Sutherland's perfomance is very good, and the others are good also. About the story...it's very touching, and it's worth seeing. Good message for those absents parents. You can discuss about this movie in a cell group in your church. Even, when it's not explicitly a Christian movie, its message if forgiveness is very profound."
3,Heartwarming Story,"This is a great heartwarming movie that just tugs at your heart. Though I felt that the acting, roles and the scenes are all excellent, I felt that parts of the plot tends to take a bit of a flair for the dramatic. For the most part, the movie was great with the moving story of a father who befriends a man that saves his life, realizing in the end that he missed out on the most important thing in his life: his son. Be prepared to cry as there are tons of tear-jerker scenes! I'm glad to have gotten a copy of it. If you haven't, get yours today. This is a movie that you have to see at least once!"
5,Fabulous,This movie is absolutely fabulous.....anyone working in a career with people with disablities should see this movie....It was heart warming.....loved it.
5,A Must See!,My husband and I watched this video and it brought tears to our eyes. We were able to discuss his relationship with our son with openness and he was able to get it. This video is God's anointed answer for every mother and wife who has been trying to reach the men in her life and get them to relate to each other. It brought out the hidden anger and resentment of fathers and sons and how this comes about.
5,wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;),"Nolee is vey beautiful! I love her second outfit and her first outfit too!

I love her crown,her very cute pup too! i love EVERYTHING! from all the fab faces doll she is the best! ;)**bye** **bye**"
3,not very comfortable but looks okay,"these shoes are pretty narrow, and together with a 4"" heel, it makes walking a pain. But the material is decent and the design is good. So I'll say you have to have narrow feet to fit comfortably."
5,LOVE THESE SHOES!,"Very, VERY happy with my shoes, thank you. They are absolutely gorgeous and can be worn for business or pleasure. Bandolino is one of the best!"
5,LOVE THESE SHOES,"These shoes are the most comfortable ever. I think because of the platform. I receive so many complimants because they are just adorable. I have black, red and brown."
3,Mildly entertaining.,"The reviews that compared this to ""The Name of the Rose"" were being very generous. I's a somewhat diverting tale, but there is nothing terribly original or surprising here. It can be read in an evening, and forgotten just as quickly. But it's a reasonable way to pass the time."
3,a mystery with historical value,"Morality Play is a book that offers not only an accurate portrayal of the hardships experienced by a traveling group of players in the 14th century, but it also offers an enthralling murder mystery. A reader remains captivated by the intreguing death of Thomas Wells, while learning history. The book begins with a death and the story is propelled by a death. Through the players' enactment, the mystery behind the death unfolds. The reader learns that there is a great deal of uncertainty and mystery surrounding the boy's death. As the players delve deeper into the murder, they find false accusations, Church corruption, and the involvement of high officials. Their need to play the Truth may prove their undoing. Morality Play truely becomes a battle between the forces of good and evil- truth versus mystery."
4,Morality Play,"I did really enjoy this book because I enjoy reading about the life and times in medieval Europe.I ordered this book after I had watched ""The Reckoning"" on tv.This movie was based on the book Morality Play.I had missed the beginning of the movie ,so the book helped me understand what I had missed."
2,I love historical mysteries but this was awful,"A runaway priest is shanghaied into a troupe of players that presents a play based on a local murder.I give up on this author, he hasn't written ANYTHING that held my attention. In this case, the narrating priest is more focused on ""if I had only known"" breastbeating than telling a coherent story. The characters were moderately interesting but they didn't DO anything."
1,Steer Clear,"This is the worst book ever. Ever. I had to purge it from my library, even though the act of purging a book from my library racked me with guilt. It was required reading in a writing class I took, and I hated every minute of reading it. I hated it so much that I made my sister read it to see if I was crazy. She hated it as well. That was in 1998. We still hold this book up as the worst book ever written, except maybe Moby Dick.If this had been a good book, I would have liked it. I am fascinated by the medieval period, and tend to gravitate toward books (fiction and non-) about that era. I like the good murder mystery most of the time. I should have liked this book. But it was beat-your-brains-out awful. The writing was stilted and unnatural. The characters were inhumanly flat.Awful! Awful! Yuck Yuck Yuck! Do yourself a favor and stay away. Or at least, if you really feel you must read it, go check a trash bin somewhere and I'm sure you'll find a copy."
4,'All the world's a stage..',"I wasn't sure about this book in the beginning, but I love historical mysteries, so I tried it out. The narrator, Nicholas Barber, is a former priest who walked away from his place and joined a group of travelling players--remarkable for a time when you were born to a social station and stayed there all your life. That is, in fact, a recurring theme--being trapped in a role, escaping from it, choosing the part you play in your own life.The mystery, which centers around the murder of a young boy, is interesting--true mystery lovers will probably figure out the ending long before the narrator does. But the surrounding story of Nicholas's development as a person and of the accused goat girl was interesting enough to keep me reading. Overall, it was a satisfying book."
3,A good book club discussion book,"Set among a troupe of players in Medieval England, ""Morality Play"" is a vigorously researced historical novel. There's a murder mystery, but that's secondary. Unsworth goes into great deal about the troupe's costumes, dramatic tools, recitation, and improvisation. One of the most interesting parts of the book is when he explains how hand gestures were used to communicate certain ideas to the audience and how they were used among players while improvising.Others in my book group liked the book more than I did but we all agreed that the value lies in its description of the times and the power and evolution of theater. There's even a clever use of Deus Ex Machina in the plot. It proved to be a good discussion book but is a must read of theater people."
4,A thrilling medieval detective story,"The novel ""Morality Play"" has a plot similar to many modern crime stories, it just takes place in the Middle Ages. In this story a young monk joins a group of travelling players. When they enter a small town they hear of a murder and decide to perform it as a play. By investigating the circumstances of the murder they find out the truth. The beginning of the novel is written very descriptively and some passages are even boring, but somewhere in the middle of the story it changes to a thrilling tale - you really get interested in the truth about the murder."
5,Great novel as well as a mystery,"I have read other books by Unsworth but liked this the best. Relatively short murder mystery set in 14th century England. However, as usual the writing is superb....he can set a scene and give you a mood as well as anyone, without resorting to overly flowery language to do it. The story itself is interesting but what is more so is the underlying themes of morality and mortality set in a time where Death hung heavily over everyone."
3,"Great lineup, sterile handling","Carlos Saura has cornered the market for flamenco movies today, from his 'Carmen' and 'Bodas de Sangre'. The long career has given him access to Spain's top artists working today. Unfortunately he has not seen fit to change his doggedly austere style, throwing artists into a stark empty room hoping to induce a more somber, and presumably purer, more dignified and more respectable Art.This may be good politics, but makes for bad art. Like it or not, the soul of flamenco cannot be torn from the Andalucian sun and earth and still live. Like Argentine tango and jazz, it is at its most vibrant and purposeful when it's at home among its people.A much better intro to flamenco, which showcases this living link, would be ""Duende y Misterio del Flamenco"", ""Los Tarantos"" by legend Carmen Amaya, or the many Spanish TV documentaries like ""Caminos Flamencos"" or ""Años de Flamenco"" (with many of the same artists), available from Catalina's (catalinas@aol.com)"
4,For flamenco lovers!,Saura is always very good at stories about the world of dance and this one is a real must for those who admire flamenco.
4,Spanish vacation,"Having spent my recent vacation in Spain, and having attended a flamengo dance performance in Sevilla (without bringing a recorder)I was glad finding this DVD. The music is of course highly authentic and I much enjoyed it. After a while though it becomes ""all of the same thing"" and starts to bore you. I ejected this DVD after 45 minutes or so. Nevertheless I do recommend purchasing it especially if you want to have an immediately accessable "" souvenir"" of your visit to Spain."
3,Not for beginner afficionado.,This is not what I was looking for. I got bored and fellasleep in the middle of the video.
1,Very Disappointing...,"Flamenco - a music that came from the streets and caves is newly repackaged in this ""movie"" and set in, of all places, some type of warehouse/sterile art museum.Everything is very arty without the hint of anyone breaking a sweat. The camera moves from one performance to another with no hint of story or purpose The performers look very posed and stilted and one of the essential components of a great flamenco performance, the audience participation or 'jaleo' is totally absent. Why? Well there is no audience.A very sanitised and packaged version sorely lacking 'duende' and authenticity.Little to no information on flamenco, its history, key players, styles. Yes, this is Flamenco for the New York chattering classes.I recommend you rent from your local library before you buy..."
3,Not what I thought...,"I have listened to flamenco music all my life..I was born in Spain, and I'm telling you that this tape is not the true flamenco you would find on the streets of sevilla, or anywhere else in the south. ALso did not have enough dancing, which is the main atraction of the flamenco music."
5,flamenco,"I liked this movie. Love the music, got in to the flamenco dancing, who didn't liked this movie, really, does not know flamenco at all."
4,Tuba + guitars = awesome.,"This rocks...traditional acoustic guitar sounds plus crazy dixieland-like tuba. Sounds weird, but it will grow on you. Plus El Potro's got a great voice..."
2,Ozzy's Not Here,"A bunch of witches use the Sin n Skin strip ""club"" (what a dump) to lure patrons to their manor. Seems they need 666 sacrifices by All Hallow's Eve to please the Dark Lord. The sheer volume of boobs (yeah, the guys are boobs, too) in this movie was not enough to distract me from how poorly the story was told. The giant foam latex Dark Lord took me back in time, however. More of a highlight than the naked ladies. Cheap and funny!"
1,What a waste of time...,"I don't know who wrote the first review for this movie, but some people should not be allowed to write reviews! This movie was awful from start to finish. It was like a very low budget porn, but with cheesy sci-fi, goth imagery in lieu of sex scenes and/or attractive people. The ""hot"" women are average at best... their big, fake breasts are sure to tantalize anyone who has just chugged a six-pack though. You know you're watching a great one when Ron Jeremy is the best actor on screen..."
2,System information,"The current, non-DirecTV system, updated by satellite, is actually 7.1 (as of 9 August 2005). I haven't found that any of the hacking books are especialy useful for Series 2 boxes, especially as the software upgrades."
2,DirecTV Tivo System-2 software Updates - now 6.1,"While this book contains some useful information for older Tivo boxes, the Series-2 has been Upgraded automatically by the Satellite to an even higher version. While the other reviewer, recently written, says it's now 5.3 and nobody has figured it out without actually tweaking hardware and reinstalling the chip (definately NOT recommended), the Software has already been upgraded again. As of now, 8/1/05, it is Version 6.1."
