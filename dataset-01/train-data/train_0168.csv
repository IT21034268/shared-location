4,"Details, details!","A detailed and fascinating view of the vastly popular entertainment genre - the people, the theaters, the stories, it's all here!"
5,Fascinating look at vaudeville,"This detailed, witty history of vaudeville will remind you of how your great-great grandparents were entertained in the days before radio, film, and television. If you like old sepia-toned photographs and turn-of-the-century black and white movies, you will love this book."
5,An Encouraging Read,"Reading Linda Russell's book feels like having a conversation with an old friend. It's intimate, refreshingly honest, hilarious and at times heartbreaking. Throughout her book, Mrs. Russell uses the timeless truths of the fruits of the Spirit as the keys to living a life of complete surrender and freedom. Mrs. Russell's book not only shares her trials and triumphs but also provides encouragement to anyone who has felt the weight of a life burdened with guilt, low self esteem and doubt.After reading this book, you will feel enlightened, encouraged and empowered to break free of life's burdens."
1,Save Your Money,This DVD is missing an entire scene and has a poor quality soundtrack.It was returned.
2,VCI EDITION!!!!!,"The reason for the low rating is the missing scene referenced by another reviewer. I have seen the scene on a Treeline 50 pack which included this film. The VCI DVD has had restoration work, and it looks good, but WHY restore an edited film. It makes no sense, especially when this scene is obviously not lost. I'm afraid I just don't see the knowledge and dedication among some of the current DVD producers to make sure we are getting a complete film when it is available, even if you have to put one together from more than one print. Missing footage and bad splices in films are just not acceptable unless there is no other choice. Anyway, the featurette is quite good. Incorrectly refered to A String of Pearls"" on the DVD case, it is ""A String of Beads"". Originally shown on Four Star Playhouse."
4,Gene Tierney and George Sanders movie,"a nice nights movie with two stars that i like a lot. Gene Tierney new to pictures at this time, but lovely. and George Sanders as a soldier who isn't so nice...a perfect for him. not a great movie in its day, but it is still better than what they put out on tv now a days. so if you think it is a Casablanca reworking, it isn't. but it is a good costumer in the dessert with pretty girls and foreign soldiers."
3,It was good,"She is beautiful and that was good and she plays her parts well, this one has some good to it. As always black and whites are old and this one you could really see that it was. But I like B&W's and I liked this one too."
4,Great Reference,"Beautifully written and illustrated, a must read for budding earth scientists from high school level through to grandparents. Reveals evidence that for the last million years, the sea level is not a steady state and more. Just Fascinating...."
1,Garbage,"On the first attempt to use this product smoke started coming out of the vents and the paddles stopped mixing the bread. I ended up with a lovely baked pile of dried flour with mush at the bottom. The machine was then completely dead. I have read about this prouct on consumer reports websites and everyone listed the same problems. It is immorral for this company to have not already issued a recall, and to continue to sell this faulty product. I'm sure it is also a fire hazard."
2,50/50,I received one of these for a gift and absolutely love it. So I bought one for my mom. First time out of the box and it starts smoking when turned on. Black & Decker wants her to pay shipping for a new one. Wrong way to do business!! Bad customer service!
2,Disappointed,"I love the product and have used it for years but this particular one is not fresh, it smells old, not bad yet but not like it is when you buy it in the store. I won't buy it online again, it's too expensive to be disappointed.Tracy"
4,Love this Camera,"This camera takes amazing pictures. I am so pleased with the quality of the photos. I haven't really gotten into all the bells and whistles of the camera yet but I cannot wait to see if the photos can get better.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because after 2 days of having the camera the lens stopped autofocusing and we had to return the entire camera. When we researched this issue online we found that this is a reoccuring problem with this lens, hopefully we do not have the same issue again."
5,"Sweet, Sweet, Oldie","I love the movies from the fortiesand Room For One More is one of myall-time favorites! It has a messagethat is timely even for today. Lotsof comedy, love, sibling rivalry andCary Grant at his best."
5,room for this one,This film is a must have for Cary Grant lovers! It is a great addition to any movie collection.
5,Room For One More,"It started off with problems, but then it began working good.It was an excellent movie. I will enjoy watching it over and over throughout the years."
5,Always room for more Cary Grant!,This is such a good movie! Good quality copy of the film and nice packaging! Looks great on my big screen tv. This is a must have for Cary Grant and/or Betsy Drake fans. So glad to be able to own a copy of this film!
4,A Surprisingly Good Comedy,"Having read some biographies about Cary Grant, I was determined to view some of his lesser-known movies. This was one of them and what a gentle surprise it was! The screenplay is witty and so good the jokes and asides also work for today. Grant is simply in top form, throwing off some under-the-breath remarks with ease and grace. I really enjoyed this and the cast is very good. Very, very enjoyable. Bonsoir!"
3,Classic Cary Grant Movie,"My wife wanted to see this so we rented it. It is a typical Cary Grant comedy movie. If you like the 40 and 50's comedies, this is a film for you."
4,Room for One More- A Delight,"This is one of the ""forgotten"" films of Cary Grant, but a very enjoyable one. The cast of children is great, and it is nice to see Grant with his real-life wife. The film is still timely, and a great family film."
5,Room for One More,I like to watch Carey Grant movies. I had not seen this one until I saw it on TCM. I went to Amazon and found it immediately. I bought it and added it to my collection. I really enjoyed the movie. It is a movie that the entire family can watch.
4,room for one more,"I was so happy to find this movie. It had been discontinued and no one carried it. Then I seen the movie on TCM and then came to amazon to look for it again and there it is ! I haven't had the opportunity to view it yet but, plan to soon."
5,Great movie,This is one of my all time favorite movies! I pretty much based my life on this movie. It is so heart warming.
5,This movie is charming and heart warming,"Who can resist Cary Grant and then wife Betsy Drake in this movie?? Not me. This movie reminds me of when I grew up, (1950's-60's), the family eating together, vacationing together but what I love best is that it shows that with a lot of love and patience, you can mend broken hearts of children. I recommend this movie with all my heart."
5,Easy to open and holds a lot,I have had mine for almost 2 years and ordering more. I really pack with paper and it has held up-- good as new. Very easy to open and used a lot.
1,Masking tape!!!!!,"This is over priced masking tape!!!! Save yourselves money & buy masking tape at the store because that is all this is. It does not bend with your feet, it is masking tape!!!!"
5,Wow,"Just to let all know...just because The Impossibles sound different two years after the broke up doesn't mean it is a bad thing. In fact, if they sounded the same this CD wouldn't be as perfect as it is. The Impossibles of old are incredible, and this CD only helps add to the musical bliss they share with us. This CD is a must have for any punk/Weezer fan, it combines the two with a touch only the Impossibles could give it. I just hope they keep making music for years to come."
1,"Old, gross, and unusable","I was really disappointed with the condition of this product. The small box holding the mascara was damaged and closed with dirty tape. Upon opening the box, the mascara was dusty and appeared to have a large powder smudge on it. The mascara was visibly very old, smelled bad, and is basically unusable."
4,Nice hat,A very nice hat with a slightly high price tag. I had a big head and I brought the X-large version of the Tula Gardener hat. It fit perfectly and comfortably on my head.
1,CDs that never arrive!,Will never know if this cd is any good as it was paid for but never sent or received. Guess you're bound to get a bad apple in every box!!
3,one of the better ones,"this is a very good book. Lots of new info. My copy had 30 missing pages at the end, even so it still rates a read."
1,Not Enough Swashbuckling and Quotation Marks,"I was hoping to read about the active and romantic adventures of a masked man clad in black, brandishing his sword, who is righting all the wrongs in the Puebla de Los Angeles. Instead, I got bogged down with page after page of narration and very little dialog between characters. The story is nearing its end when the ""real"" Zorro finally appears!"
3,Not what I expected,"Isabel Allende is a terrific writer and while I enjoyed the book I did not feel the title of Zorro was justified. It seemed periferal, more of a marketing tool than the early life of Zorro, which since he's fictional to begin with, did not really need the elaboration.That said, all of her books are worth reading."
1,One dull read,"Reading Isabel Allende's Zorro, is like taking a trip through Wicapedia. Plenty of interesting detail strung to a frame made of more detail. If you want to know general history about early California, what it was like to cut across Panama in the days before the canal, the Spanish Inquisition, and so on, then it is okay. But it is generally told from such a distant and obtuse point of view that the characters lack any zest. Thus, the encyclopedia analogy. I say make a wide berth around this one."
1,Oh please...,"If you are a Zorro fan for as long as I have been, you probably bought this book looking for fun, light reading of swashbuckling adventure and the colorful characters we all know and love. If that's the case, you really won't like it. I mean... Senora De la Vega was a Spanish noblewoman, and we all know it - not a native Anerican or a lady of mixed birth. To think of Diego and Bernardo as brothers is almost laughable, and even annoying. Diego is so unappealing that he makes me sick. Why does everyone want to try and fix what ain't been broke? Forget this."
3,A bit of a yawner,"Zorro has its moments. It's a slowly-paced story where we see occasional glimpses of the dashing hero to come. However, much of the praise here for Isabel Allende's writing is lost on me. I often found it awkward; I didn't see the brilliant turn of phrase for which Ms Allende is lauded. To be fair, though, this is a translation from Spanish, where the writing may well be more lyrical.While I had a hard time picking this one back up after setting it down, I found that struggling to the half-way point had rewards. The pace picked up somewhat, and the story found some purpose. As Diego de la Vega started to become Zorro, the narrator found her voice, and my eyes didn't grow so weary."
5,Wonderful!,"Isabel Allende is a wonderful, magnetic author. Zorro is a must read (or hear via audio). Beginning with Zorro's childhood Allende develops a magnetic character in a hero-in-process. Zorro's life and development into a folk hero take us into many vibrant ""historical"" situations, and we meet marveious and intriquing characters in the Native Americans of California, the gypsies of Spain, pirates of New Orleans and just plain rogues of early California. Like the other Allende books I've read, Zorro moves quickly; it was very hard to ""put down."" I listened to the audio version and shared it with three others who thought it equally marvelous. The print version was purchased for my grown son who was completely swept up in the story. I will read Zorro again some day."
2,disappointing,"I absolutely loved the House of Spirits and Eva Luna, especially the latter. I gave this book 2 stars because I expected a lot more from Isabel Allende. This book is very put-downable. There is no exciting development as far as I'm concerned. She's definitely got the talent but the story just flows so effortlessly in her previous novels that this one seems very far-fetched. But then again, I didn't like the Daughter of Fortune either, so I guess it's not just that I don't like a male hero. Although Diego does seem a little too narcissistic for me, and sometimes, laughably naive. To summerize it, I didn't like the main characters, there was nothing outrageously intriguing and everything seemed all too familiar."
2,"She Did Her Research, But Where's the Zing?","This book is very well-researched, and I can't fault the writing. However, it's very dry reading. A certain excitement is missing. Maybe it's because the book was translated from Spanish? I found myself wishing there were illustrations."
3,"Read it in Spanish, or watch the movie","Zorro is a bland, average, by the numbers chronicle of the hero's childhood and early adulthood. It reads like the novelization of a movie. The problem is that Isabel Allende wrote the novel in Spanish, and I read it in English, and everyone should know that translations are imitations at best. Word choice is very important to a writer. Imagine someone replaced every word of your favorite novel with a synonym--it would be a completely different work. When Allende writes ""zorro,"" she means ""zorro,"" not ""fox,"" which is the English translation. While I'm sure that her Spanish prose is lyrical and eloquent, the English narrative is tedious. Anyone who wants to read ""Zorro"" should learn Spanish first."
4,Zorro Begins!,"What a wonderful story told by a brilliant author. This Zorro origin tale reminds me of one of my favorite movies from last year, ""Batman Begins."" Like this novel, that movie provided a fresh new look at a familiar hero. That movie developed the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman through dark cinematic images and flashbacks in the same way that Allende develops Diego de la Vega/Zorro through her beautiful prose. It is no wonder that the creator of Batman was influenced by Johnston McCulley's Zorro. My one disappointment was that this book had to end. This sorrow not only came from the fascinating and imaginative tale ending, but also from the lack of true Zorro adventures (as the legendary hero fighting injustice in old California). I had hoped to read more swashbuckling once Allende established Diego as Zorro. Perhaps Allende will save these tales for further novels. One can only hope."
4,A great new twist on an old tale,"As a fan of the original, I was prepared to be disappointed, but Ms. Allende made this story live and breathe in a wonderful new light. You find yourself on the edge of your seat - just hating to put this story down. Vividly written and sensitively drawn, this Zorro will make you pine for the days when heroes were virtuous and romantic, and villans were easily spotted and vanquished with a little cleverness and swordplay."
4,Missing title character,"I got the feeling while reading this book that Allende was intimidated by the character of Zorro and she kept skirting around him, spending her time instead building the characters and world that shaped Diego de la Vega and inspired Zorro. At other times I felt like she was too wrapped up in paying homage to Douglas Fairbanks and it seemed like she tried to merge the Black Pirate (1926) and the Mark of Zorro (1920) into one timeline/one character. The first 200 hundred pages take too long to get into the action. By the time Zorro had emerged I was ready for the book to be over."
3,Allende and I both ran out of steam,"Fairly typical Allende: dysfunctional families, quirky details, elements of the supernatural. However, I felt that the book lost steam midway through and it was a bit of a struggle to slog through to the end."
1,Not normally one to post bad reviews,"I'm not a guy who dosen't like something and then posts how bad it is..To each their own as far as I see it.But,the fact that this book is a bestseller is just WRONG.I've been PLODDING through this mess for a good month and a half and am literally counting the days until I'm free.I'm convinced the author watched ""The Mask of Zorro"" and had dreams about Antonio and then decided to write a book.How interesting that one of the characters is named Isabel?If you're a Zorro fan..STAY AWAY from this absolute waste of time and money."
1,defective.Leaking oil.,"As soon I open the box ,I tried to see how it woks;I got black oil on my hands ,my pant everywhere.This machine is leaking oil .And still I didn't use it.What to do with that now ,return it to amazon for refund or just trash it ?"
2,The American Ropers,"The title of this book is a con (confidence trick). The full title is ""The Ropers: a biographical Record from circa 1300 to 1982"", but of more than 800 pages a scant 13 deal with the period before 1637 when John Roper of Buckenham, Norfolk sailed to Massachusetts and became the first of the American Ropers. Thus the English Ropers are disposed of hastily with absolutely no biographical information, and there is no attempt to show the connection of John Roper the American settler with the English family. The remainder of the book deals exhaustively with the American Ropers and will be of interest to those who don't care how they arrived in the colonies."
3,I liked it up until it cracked,"I can't tell if it is something I did, but the thing split after 4 months. It was never dishwashed, it was oiled once and used maybe 20 times. I'm going to miss this, but since it now leaks, I can't use it."
3,"It's okay, I suppose...","One foot fell off (had to nail it back on), doesn't hold up well to dishwasher (and damned if I'm going to wash it by hand). I wish Henckels would make their footed cutting boards again; those things lasted almost 5 years. I doubt this one will last a year."
4,Weather Report lives on!,"If you are already familiar with this supergroup, then the tune selections will more than please. Many different incarnations of the band are present- bassists Jaco Pastorius & Alphonso Johnson, drummers Chester Thompson, Omar Hakim, Peter Erskine, Alex Acuna and percussionsits Manolo Badrena, Jose Rossy, and Acuna join founding memebers Wayne Shorter and Joseph Zawinul . Electric and harmonically advanced tunes imbued in African and South American sytles shape this 2-CD set. The only quibble lies in the less than excellent recording quality. If your a Weather Report fan, this surely is the CD set you have been waiting for...if your new to this group, starting out with some of their previous releases would be advisable ( e.g. Black Market, Heavy Weather, Mysterious Traveler ). M.Harris"
4,Brat Farrar,Purchased this book for a book discussion group. Thought Tey must be a new author because I had not heard of her. Was suprised to discover that she is a vintage author. The book had an interesting story to tell and we had a good discussion. I may try to find some of her other books.
4,well written,"Good story, original, but kind of abruptly ends. Poor kindle copy. Too many spelling mistakes to give it more stars."
4,Good Character Developement,"What was interesting in this whodunnit was the character developement, not something a lot of whodunit writers are good at. Only Bigfoot Littlefoot and West comes to mind and that is wildly different. I enjoyed this book and am glad I read it."
2,Nah.,"Too bad as I heard good things about this author but for myself, I found the writing slow. Read it because it was our group's selection but I was not thrilled with this book. Kept waiting for something to happen. Boring. Doubt I'll read another one by Tey."
2,disappointing,"I picked this book at the bookstore to while time away, and I'm very glad I didn't buy it. the outline of the plot was appealing but in the end it was mediocre. I didn't like the main character all that much, and mostly he stayed in the shadow, as unknown to us as he was to the family. It's also hard to believe that he wasn't revealed as the impostor. the odds of pulling that off are very low. The story went on at a slugglish pace, and the mystery took a backseat most of the time. Most of the time it was Brat going around the estate and meeting people. The suspense was nonexistent. I think Agatha Christie is much more interesting. Also, the mystery in this book was weak and quite predictable."
2,Disappointing,"I don't agree with the many people who raved about this book. The plot synopsis hooked me, but the manner in which the lead character determines that a murder took place, and the manner in which he determines the murderer, is very simplistic, and unimaginative.Further, the ""mystery"" is really secondary to the plot of how the lead character is going to deceive those around them that he is the long-lost brother.Exceptionally disappointing - with a plot like that, the writer could have truly done much better."
1,extremely poor quality item,"This so called thumb stabilizer is not even worth being called a glove. I do not believe it's really leather, and it only has one very small splint. Why they charge so much for it is beyond me."
3,item is ok.,item arrived very fast. the produrt itself only has one metal stay so it's got very little support in my opinon. my thumb was moving too much and i had to re-enforce it.
1,Description-,"In your description of the Andis replacement if it truly does fit all, please put model numbers. I am hesitant to buy this unless I know its completely universal. It just seems there is no detailed description of what models it fits or that it is universal."
5,This basket is HUGE!,"I just received this basket today. It is MASSIVE! Incredibly impressive looking and would knock the socks off anyone receiving it. Very attractively arranged, and the basket itself will last long after the goodies are gone as a functional decoration."
2,Save your money,This book is not worth buying. It provides very little information on specific dive sites. I did not use the book once to make a dive choice during two weeks in Southern Belize. A good dive book for Belize is really needed - it was difficult to locate good dive operators for some areas...but this book was of no value.It does have some nice pictures and a very basic fish/coral guide in the back.
2,Not so informative...,"This is a fair book, but loads of sites are missing (from this edition at least) and much of the information I expected to find was not in it - particularly the prices and quality of the various diving shops. It is a mere overview of what you find under the sea, with little on how to actually get to that point."
4,Lots of fun and entertating,I reviewed this book a few years ago but now that I have lived with it I think it is interesting and fun to read. The origin of many idioms and phrases is entertaining.
3,It wakes up your senses,"It's explosive, tragic and sad. It's got strong characters which make you thinks about your artificial senses and the truth ones...It was very interesting, I'd never read such kind of book before."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!,"I tell everyone when they check out the Wish Giver that it is a great book and that they are in for a great time.When Thaddeus Blinn is selling speicial wish cards no one knows that they must be careful what they wish for... I reccomend this book to everyone.Thank you for your time, and remember be careful what you wish for!"
4,The Wish Giver,"The Wish Giver is a book with five different stories that all link together. The Prolouge is the begining of the book, and thats when Stew Meat, Polly Kemp, Rowena Jervis, and Adam Fiske get these wish cards from Thaddeus Blinn. In Jug - A - Rum, it talks about Polly Kemp and her wish. In The Tree Man, it talks about Rowena Jervis and her wish. In Water, Water Everywhere, it talks about Adam Fiske and his wish. Then, in the Prologue, it talks about the ending. The style of Bill Britain's (the author) writing is very creative and unpredictable. The Wish Giver is the kind of book that you don't want to put down."
5,REALLY FUNNY BOOK!,"This is a very good book. It is about tree kids who buy wish cards from the wish giver. They wish for good things but they always get bad. Each kid has a side of the story. There is a girl who wants to be popular but ends up unpopular, a girl who likes a boy but turns him into a tree, and a boy who wants water for his farm but gets way too much. How will they get their wishes reversed? Find out when you read The Wish Giver!"
5,My classmates loved this book!,"After my third grade teacher read this book to us, mostly everyone wanted to get it in the school library! I think that the wish giver should have a sequal. The Wish Giver II. Then maybe the The Wish Giver III, or Iv or V!"
3,"If you like magic, then you should read The Wish Giver.","It's a book about three kids that are at a church social. All three kids want a wish granted from the wish giver. Unfortunately, their wishes were turned around. I didn't like that the author made three separate parts. I would have liked it better if all the characters were in each chapter. I give this book three stars because it was both funny and interesting and it made me laugh."
4,a wish can not always give you what you want,The wish giver is about three kids kids who go to a man called Thaudeous Blinn and get a wish card with a spot in the middle. All you have to do is put your thumb on the spot and make a wish. One girl wishes she was popular and got a lot attention. She then later starts to croak. Another girl wishes her boyfriend would plant his roots and stay in coven tree and stay forever. He ends up turning into a tree. A boy wishes his farm would have water throughout the whole farm. His wish goes wrong and the farm gets flooded. I like the book because of the excitment.
2,amanda from Creston,The Wish Giver is not one of my favorite books. I felt that the characters weren't fully developed and if they were they were antagonists. Though the protagonist seemed to be a static character. The book didn't explain too much about the year and what was going on around that time. Bill Brittain did devolpe the mood or atmosphere well. The Wish Giver didn't have a plot so the setting couldn't move it along.
3,"If you like magic, this is the book for you!","I think this book is at a sixth and seventh grade reading level. I didn't like this book because of all the difficult words and the slang words. But, I did like the ending and you will too."
5,It's was a great because it teaches people to think wisely.,All their wishes come true in a bad way. pauly is my faviorite charicter because she is funny and nasty.I recamend this book!
5,I was dreaming of what was going to happen.,I like how he decided to makes wishes come true but it did something wrong.Like Polly Kemp made a wish and her voice started croaking! Rowena wished and made someone into a tree.Her friend was a tree up to his chin.
5,I read a book called The Wish Giver.,"It was written by Bill Brittain. The Wish Giver is about a man called Thaddeus Blinn who comes to Coven Tree and sets his tent near a forest. There is a sign in front of the tent that says, "" I can give you whatever you want for only 50 cents."" Most people walk passed the tent but 4 people were curious and walked into the tent. Their names were Poly Kemp, Stew Meat, Rowena Jervis, Adam Fiske, and Thaddues. Thaddues gives them a card with a red dot on it. Thaddues Blinn said, "" When you are ready put your thumb on the red dot and wish wisely because there is only one wish and the wish will come true the way you say it."" They took the cards home and one by one they wished, and they learned a lesson from their wish. I give this book two thumbs, well actually two quarters way up !"
4,The Wish Giver,"The story of The Wish Giver is a great story. I think all the kids Polly, Rowena, and Adam were all wonderful. Plus their wishes were hilarious. First Polly kept jug-a-ruming and Rowena stuck a man in the ground and also Adam flooded out his farm and all this happened by a few simple wishing cardes from Thaddeus Blinn. He's the snicky man behind this mystery."
4,READ The Wish Giver!!!!!!!!,"In school my class and I read the book the Wish Giver. This book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small, chubby, mysterious little man named Thaddeus Blinn. When each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way. The moral of the story is ""Be Careful what you wish for"". This was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed it. Bill Brittain was a wonderful author. I highly reccomend this book."
4,The Wish Giver,The Wish Giver was a really good book. Some parts were really exciting. This book had many problems. They didn't know how to unrealease their wishes. They all wished on something they really wanted. Then it comes out that something bad happens. I always wanted to read more whenever we ran out of time. I think people who like mysteries and fantasy books would enjoy this book.
3,Wishing May not be so Good,this story is about three kids who meet a man named Thaddeus Blinn. He gives them each one wish. Each of them say the wrong things and weird things start happening. But in the end they find a way to stop them. I liked it bacause I think magic is cool.
3,"after we go, things are much better","This CD release was a disappointing one, because Hugo got in the way of the talented former-DOTN member's ability to lay down some good music. Jesse, Matt and Todd, it's time to move on. Forget about Hugo, he is a sub-par singer and song writer(proof from 'After We Go'). The three stars are for Jesse, Matt and Todd; Hugo doesn't get one. From a monday morning quarterback's perspective, you guys and Travis need to set aside your differences and get back together to make the world a better place (perhaps at your own expense).Sorry for such harsh words, but I'm only trying to save you guys from becoming just anthoer group of dying-out rock venue.DOTN - Todd, Matt, Travis, Jesse. (a true rock band)p.s.-Sometimes you have to do what you don't like in order to survive."
2,What?,"Stop saying this is ""heavy"", it's far from it! this is more like creed than anything, and creed blow heartily! At least Travis Meeks (Days of the New) is CREATIVE with the acoustics, these guys are a crappy rehash of the first Days of the New album. Avoid at all costs and go buy the 2nd and 3rd Days of the New albums."
1,For Such A Promising Band...They Fell Short..,"I was such a big fan of their debut album, I felt that Tantric would have a great second. Which is why I decided to buy a cheaper copy off of Amazon rather then pay full price at BestBuy. After really giving it sometime, the album feels forced and soul less. Hey Now was the single that pulled me in but the problem with it lies within its very weak chorus. The only good song on this album is Hero. I think that Todd went into an area that didn't suit him nor the band. One star for the song Hero. Don't waste your time on this album. Enjoy their first album."
1,Boring Band,"A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville, KY because my friend likes them. A band called Silvertide was opening for them, and let me just say Tantric was pahetic compared to them. The crowd sucked, that's why I hate modern alternative rock bands like this...the fan base is as boring as the music. All the people did was stand and watch. At the beginning of one song the Tantric's singer said ""This is for all you headbangers and moshers out there"" as if he expected someone to actually make a big movement like that, and I hope he didn't, 'cause if he did, he was disappointed. Simply put: the opening band blow the headliners away. How sad is that?"
2,"The cd and the music are very similiar, both like me.","I found God once and only once, and this CD helped me do it. I owe Morissey everything I am today and so, so, so much more. I owe him $1.24 for my self-esteem, I owe him $3.76 for my eyes. This cd just makes you want to owe him things, I owe him a liver, thanks for letting me borrow the liver Morissey, you're a peach man. Buy this album, owe him something, its so very easy."
4,Evenly baked muffins!,"I picked this muffin tray for its affordable price and its light colour that I hoped would help my muffins and cupcakes cook more evenly. And it works beautifully. The muffins I baked were evenly cooked, not too browned and slid right out of the cups, even though I just greased them lightly and didn't use paper liners.I'm cutting one star because this muffin tray is slightly bigger than I expected. Thanks to the oversized handles, it fits very awkwardly in my oven and I wish that weren't the case :-("
1,"Four months later, and I have to buy a new pan!","I hated this pan. It did not wash easily at all, and my muffins got stuck every time. I read: ""...pop out easily....""....well, not for me, apparently. Washing the pan in the dishwasher just produced brown stains which could then not be removed by hand. In short, here it is, just four months later, and I've had to junk this pan and purchase a new one. I paid more for my Pyrex muffin pan, but now the muffins DO actually pop out easily!"
5,Excellent muffin pan,"A very nice pan. It cooks things very evenly, and does not burn anything on the bottoms. Muffins and cupcakes seem to rise more, and the sides and bottoms are never dry. The pan itself is a very weighty thick gauge metal...feels quite solid. It's an inexpensive way to drastically improve the quality of your muffins and cupcakes!"
4,works well,"it's quite hefty (not a bad thing), had good handles on both ends (easy to use), and I've already made muffins, and they slid out the pan very easily. Nice product."
2,Too Little for Too Much,"I totaly concur with the other review. Not enough real GRIP info. I've been a grip for over 10 years and actually thought I'd get something usefull, but actually this book is just the last few chapters of the Grip Book, drawn out, for 50 bucks. I mean, yea there's an illustration of mounting on a DC3 Plane, but its crappy and nonspecific. I mean there's almost more AC and Electric info than Grip. Underwater Exposure Housings? Ummm not Grip Dept. I'm just getting more into rigging and wanted to see more real world stuff, not even a mention of speedrail/nurail in the Index or Glossary, and barely a page in between brings it up and we know how important it is in rigging and on the spot ingenuity.The most important part of this book is ""The Big Break"", how to act on set for noobs, pretty much."
5,Great fit,"works great, just what we needed to extend the length of the output cord on our FM mp3 music player"
3,"good product, bad service","the product was exactly what I wanted, but it came a week and a half late, and then I had to go to the post office and pay 20 cents to get it. Also, I now have no specific use for it as the time I wanted it for passed before it arrrived"
4,It's a coupler,"I'm writing this review because Amamax won't stop bugging me through emails. It's a coupler... works just like a coupler. No issues, cheap. Buy it if you need it, but absolutely don't buy it if you don't need it."
1,"Well, u get what you pay. Works only one side","So, I will keep it really simple. It took a long time to reach me (probably from because it is just not ""Made in China"" its also ""Shipped from China"").. then when I plugged I can only hear one side of my headphone speaker.I would suggest you not to waste your time and even a penny on this POS. As per the positive reviews I think either they are fake or those customers are lucky to have received a good working piece."
4,Worked for what I needed it to,Ordered this to make my XBOX 360 a little more portable.Was shipped fast and worked exactly for what I needed it for
5,works fine,Does what it does. Aux wire goes into this and another wire at the end goes into speakers. Low price. Cannot go wrong
4,"Cheap cost, good product","bought this to extend the reach of my headphones for late night movie watching. Works great, no issues, easy to use, and does not stick together too strong. Like that it keeps the cords together, but can unplug without straining the cords. Mega cheap price, arrived a day early than expected."
2,Unreliable connection,"The connection goes bad about once a day. That said, if you just fiddle with it for a second, the problem is fixed for another day. And it was only $1 including shipping. For my purposes, this is fine, but if you like things to work 100% of the time, don't buy this."
1,Only works with left speaker/headphone,"Either it's mono and transfers all the input to the left speaker, or I just received a faulty one. Either way, wouldn't recommend the product."
2,Poor Connections,"The build quality of this coupler is poor. The internal connectors don't firmly grip the plug when inserted, leading to intermittent dropouts whenever the cable is touched or twisted. I wouldn't buy this product again."
4,good,"Cheap, plastic, lightweight. Gets the job done. I basically put it in place and left it, and it's done its job perfectly well. I don't know how long it's going to last? Like I may not trust it in an application where I needed to constantly plug and unplug things, but it's good enough for my applications and it was a very, very good price."
4,I needed extra couplers in my newly established sound system,these extra couplers was needed in my new sound system. they seem to meet the quality that I was looking for.
4,Pretty Cool...,I used to LOVE these movies when I was younger so I bought the double feature. After watching it I can say I'm glad I own it but it's kind of cheesy. The fighting is fake sometimes but the music is great and the story is pretty cool too.
4,Awesome.,"Mortal Kombat was one of the very first combat videogame adaptations that I really loved unlike subsequent ones to come. It's one heck of a movie with a very good premise and interesting fight scenes that most of us, who love the game back to when we played it (some of us still do), find quite exhilarating."
3,Typical martial arts kitsch/cheesy effects,"I re-watched this, with my partner yesterday, for a light-hearted time. She loved this film in HS, and we laughed through most of it. You can't help but laugh at some of the cheesey effects, and dialogue, but if you like movies based on video games or don't mind this ""tongue in cheek"" cliche action genre, give it a rent!"
3,ok if you don't own both already. sad not widescreen.,Don't know why they packaged both movies together in fullscreen and not widescreen. The only good thing I did notice is the picture quality and video color on the first one does look alot better than the older widescreen version. So if the screen format of the movies don't matter it's worth getting this pack.
4,Mortal Kombat I and II,I own both of these on Vhs tapes and thought it would be nice to own on dvd as well the picture was good and its full screen which I love.I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of Mortal Kombat.I cant wait to find the Mortal Kombat television series
4,Both movies in one set. Are they worth it?,"Everyone in their 20's and 30's should know what Mortal Kombat is. It was a ver popular video game for SNES in the early 90's. It was made into a movie that at the time seemed very popular as well. It has some awesome fight scenes, decent special effects, and a very good soundtrack. The 2nd movie picked up immediately where the first left off. Most of the old characters and some newer ones from the 3rd and 4th games. The 2nd movie was kinda weak though. It had different actors, that couldn't act to save their lives, and a much weaker soundtrack. I don't even think it made theaters. I recommend buying the double feature. You can get both movies for almost the same price as the 1st one by itself. Even though the 2nd one isn't that great, you may as well have it too, since it doesn't cost hardly any extra and it won't take up any more space than just buying the first one. If you're gonna get Mortal Kombat, you may as well get this set."
3,FLAWLESS VICTORY,"1ST FILM IS GREAT,2ND FILM IS SO SO! MANY DIE HARD ""MORTAL KOMBAT"" FANS WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT FILMS WERE NOTHING LIKE THE ARECADE GAME BUT AT LEAST THE CHARACTERS WERE INCLUDED AND FIGHT SCENES SO COOL! IF ONLY THEY HAD INCLUDED THE ""FATALITY"" ENDINGS,TOO GORY FOR HOLLYWOOD I GUESS?(WHATEVER)!"
3,No WAAAY...,Where to begin.The actual dvd itself is good. For an old movie it looks pretty good.But I am a huge Mortal Kombat fan.Although I did buy the dvd I found it inaccurate.Maby this is just me nitpicking at the little mistakes. But it cant be any worse than the street fighter movie right.But anyway.It was ok.
3,Great pearl -- not so great chain.,"I thought the pearl was a very good size and quality for the price. I was very happy with this purchase, though I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the gold chain. I think it's much too thin for such a large pendant and I'm worried it's going to break very easily."
4,Surprising good buy!,"I actually bought this planning on only using the chain. I broke one of my necklaces and needed a rather thin chain, and this was cheaper than just getting the chain alone. I figured for this price, no way the pearl was going to be any good. I was wrong. It's no mikimoto, but the one I received was a good looking pearl. Well worth the money."
5,This score is great!!! My orchestra loved it!,This score is great!!! My orchestra loved it! I know you will too
5,Allen's Greek Philosophy,"For a teacher willing to present his or her own analysis of the period, but looking for an inexpensive source of well-translated key texts from the pre-Socratics to Aristotle, this collection is unbeatable. At 450 pages it contains more than enough core reading for a one-term course. Moreover, it includes the 'unmoved mover' argument from the 'Phaedrus', which its competitors, even at twice the length and thrice the price do not."
3,quality book of original texts,"This book does not deal with analysis, it is a book of the texts of the ancients. The textual translations are accurate, and the sources Allen provides for further research are sound. It is an inexpensive quality way to learn the extant writings of the Ancients. If you are looking for analysis or explanation, though -- look elsewhere."
2,not what was promised,"The book's condition was a little more beat up than I would have liked to see it in. Please honestly tell what condition you are sending the book in, not just, very-good for everything."
5,A cookbook to inherit,"Hopefully my daughters, or one of them, will wish to inherit my 1945 copy. I inherited it from my (non-cooking) mother in law, and it's a beauty. Green cover, perfect pages; I treasure it. You can learn so much from this book. I encourage you to get one for your daughter or daughter in law--or cooking son!!! It's a keeper."
5,love these rings,These were exactly what I was looking for. Great for work and going out. Sometime I would even stack with other rings. Size was accurate
3,"Decent Music, Not So Good Lyrics","Well, i bought this as a CD about 12 years ago now and just got it back out. I had bought it because i liked the album cover (yes, i know, don't judge a book by its cover...). The first 4 songs musically were pretty good, the lyrics were generic and nothing new but they went well enough with the songs. After song 4, the quality of the lyrics dropped dramatically from mediocre to oddly hilarious in an unintentional way (not to insult the writers of the songs). I think Sweet Potato was the one i actually laughed out loud at...it was cheesy. Despite the lyrics though the music was good and had a good classic sound to it which is something you didn't see enough of in 2000/2001 and is something that is nearly non-existent in mainstream rock now. Overall, i'd recommend the music to fans of classic 90's rock."
4,too bad it's their only album,"Really good stuff, classic rock and roll. They're not trying to break any molds or shift any paradigms or any other over-used phrase for change, but Isle of Q knows how to put out a solid rock album."
4,Thankgod,"Its nice to know there is hope for the music buisness. I am so tired of the ""music"" of today."
4,Good Tunes,"Where did these guys come from? This stuff has the taste from the past that I'll never let go with great guitar to keep it modern and fresh. If you appreciate a great voice, but can do with rap blasting-anger lyrics, check it out."
2,yawn!!!!!,"Another cliche rock band with cliche lyrics and no sense of style whatsoever. very talented musicians however, but their songs say nothing to me."
5,"Terrible rock is the disease, and Isle of Q is the cure.","As a child of the '90s, I find it hard wading through a sea of putrid rap-rock clones such as Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit to get to the music I enjoy. I'm not saying that those bands are talentless, but their main goal is just to piss off the media, and get some pre-pubescent teens to worship them as a deity...not make good music. It's a wonder in this day in age that ""old school"" rock can even survive. And to help the cause, Isle of Q has risen from the ashes of the '90s and given us a simple, but crushing rock album. These things are hard to come upon. From the first track ""Little Scene"" you will be amazed to how good the quality of music that is contained within. And the songs don't get tired out from being same (another problem with music today). So if you're ready for some of the old, check this out.P.S. to the band...consider ""Bag of Tricks"" for the next radio single..."
3,Good first effort,"Not a ""must have"", but a ""glad I bought it"" CD. A mix of Cheap Trick and Creed, this CD does rock. The vocals are far more melodic than most bands of this genre, and that's a good thing here. Too many bands scream for screaming sake, and not to make emphasize a point. The music is a bit simplistic at times, but dark enough and odd enough too keep you listening. The production on it is so-so. Hopefully it will gain them some attention, like the State did for Nickelback, or Fush Yu Mang for Smashmouth and they will be able to truly amaze us with ther second coming. Check out Sweet Potato, Meltdown, and Little Scene."
1,Failed in seven days,"This ""seven year watch"" literally failed in seven days, with no harsh treatment at all: Not exposed to moisture, heat, or even much cold. Very, very disappointing, especially considering that a) the last Timex I bought, about ten years ago, only lasted 6 months, and b) I decided to pay a little extra for the watch this time in hopes it would last longer than cheaper watches usually do.Well, the Casios might chip and peel and look ugly, but at least they still work.Also, the stock band is quite thick and difficult to buckle. Case is irritatingly thick (thought it would be OK, but it got on my nerves).On the slight upside, it looks great: Nice solid chrome case with a brushed-steel (albeit stationary and therefore FAKE) timer-bezel."
5,Useful and well-made,These are useful as kitchen scissors as well because they come apart and are thus easy to clean. They are as well-made as any other pair I've seen in this price range.
2,"Looks like a neat gadget, until you see it in person.","I received this as a gift since it was on my wishlist. Upon opening the gift, I was immediately disappointed in the durability of the product. You have to separate the scissors into two pieces to use some of the tools and I think in time, the mechanism that holds them together will wear. The thickness and quality of the metal blades/tools is pretty weak. The handles are plastic. How long will they last if you really use this as a tool?The scissors are pretty good for light duty cutting, but they wouldn't even cut through some heavy gauge string that was part of the packaging of one of my child's toys. Aside from the scissors, I'll have a hard time making use of a lot of these other tools. This will probably get thrown in the junk drawer and be forgotten about until I can't find a my regular pair of scissors."
4,Decent!,"These are not finely-machine pieces of billet alloy steel, and if you plan to use any of the 12 functions every day, you will probably be quickly disappointed. However, for the price, it's a well-made tool with a bunch of features that will go great in your trunk or toolbox."
3,Tiffany Table Settings,"the book,Tiffany Table Settings, was pretty badly used, the cove in bad shape.but i love the book anywayIt arrived in time"
2,Prefer to stay on land.,Swimming with Sharks has a cult following but I found the message overwhelmed by the violence.Not one of Kevin's best showcases.
4,Biting!,"Brilliantly acted satire that was overlooked at the box office. The end is very disturbing and was the only part of the movie I didn't like and didn't feel it fit the story, otherwise I would have given it five stars. Five stars for the performances though, not one weak link in this film! Anyone interested in Hollywood and movies will want to see this."
4,This movie is Hilarious!,Kevin Spacey is great as usual. Spacey always brings a great underline humour to his characters and he dosen't fail to bring it here. The picture that is painted about work environment is very scary but very realistic. There are sharks out there!
2,Difficult to Watch,"This film should be categorized as horror. The acting was first rate but OMG the subject matter just hit too close to home.I have worked with these people before. Worse, my sister was one of those steamroller screaming bullies. They make your life hell if you let them. So, after watching the first 30 minutes, I finished watching in fastforward until the last 10 or so minutes.My story turned out with the bully getting a super-sized dose of karma but I know that that doesn't always happen--in this life."
3,Worth renting for Kevin Spacey fans,"I was expecting a comedy and was therefore a bit appalled by the intensity and violence. Be warned, this is not a comedy. Kevin Spacey is wonderful, the surrounding cast horrid. The female producer character is far too old for the male lead and the ending is lame and contrived. That said, if you like Kevin, it's really worth screening. What a talent."
2,I just didn't get it,"This movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch. I don't like that; going back and forth and not knowing what they ""want"" from me. And I REALLY didn't 'get' the ending. I didn't buy the romance. The only thing I enjoyed about this whole movie was Kevin Spacey; that's it. Just skip through the rest of the crap."
2,Revolting,"This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This is one of our favorite movies.....but, when we sat down to enjoy it, the last 2 scene segments would not play. Very unsettling!"
2,"Great actor, horrible movie!","I only gave it 2 stars because Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor. Had he not been in it, i would have shut it off half way through. i don't know why this movie is classified as a comedy?? Kevin Spacey insults that guy & screams at him, and that is funny when Kevin acts like that. But the whole movie is more of a drama, about a guy who holds his boss hostage. And the end of the movie is just plain STUPID! It was a straight to video movie, i now know why. I have went to the theatre and seen AMERICAN BEAUTY, and that is now my all time favorite movie, it's Kevin Spacey back at his best! also, other GOOD Kevin movies are, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SEVEN, THE NEGOTIATOR, and THE REF is even better than this movie! So save your money for when AMERICAN BEAUTY comes to tape."
5,Good movie,"Sarcasm and humor, set in the competitive business world. Spacey in one of his finest roles. Suitable for father and son watching."
3,It's all Spacey,"This is a classic example of a mediocre movie elevated by one single brilliant performance. Kevin Spacey absolutely dominates this movie. He's abrasive and a total a--hole, and he's perfect in the role. If anyone one else played Buddy Ackerman, this movie would be, at best, a two-star movie. The plot is decent and the other performances are just okay. 1995 was a great year for Spacey (he did Seven and Usual Suspects in that year, also), and this was just one of the reasons why.Out...."
4,CLASSIC SPACEY...,"Kevin Spacey is magnificent as always in this quirky, black comedy. Shown in flashbacks and ""the now"", Spacey is an abusive boss finally confronted by his assistant. It's hilarious and has a great surprise ending. This is classic Kevin Spacey--he's absolutely brilliant, witty and cold as ice in this film."
5,Hilarious and well-observed black comedy,"I tried to get my hands on this movie for a while, and eventually did last year. I was not disappointed! Kevin Spacey excels as the crass, foul-mouthed boss-from-Hell. If anyone has any doubt about Spacey's acting ability, they are completely mistaken. See this movie! It confirms him(as if we needed confirmation...), as one of, if not THE best actors around. Frank Whaley must be commended for his brilliant comic turn as Spacey's doormat. The writing is superb - the script is packed full of quotable put-downs, and all concerned with this movie should be extremely proud."
2,"Nah, grating and irritating without payoff","Nothing much going on here in any sort of clever, witty, or probing way. I'm going to disagree with most here and say that the implausible storyline is exacerbated by Spacey, overacting and chewing scenery without restraint, nuance, or anything that allows other characters to work with successfully. He's immeasurably better as the heartless boss in Glengarry Glen Ross, a role played expertly (and of course helped by brilliant writing and story, two elements absent from Swimming With Sharks). You can feel that he ""thinks"" he's really doing it up right, but it's wanker stuff all the way down the line. Yawn. Many excellent office/workplace/boss films out there to see before bothering with this mediocre effort."
2,Swimming With Sharks - Kevin Spacey,"This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch. Not a favourite."
3,Had it not been for the end...,I absolutely loved this film for its superb dialogue. It is psychologically involved and devilishly humorous. it was absolutely enjoyable intill the very end where everything goes prematurely flaccid in an unexpected anticlamax. Why did not the producers spend thirty more minutes on the plot to make a better ending. This film would have been superb. Because of that three stars because I tend to expect more out of capable people.
2,couldnt finish it,"I didn't like it ,the dialogue was bad. The premise was bad, the acting was horrible and the plot was even worse"
2,Who Would You Rather Work For Buddy Ackerman Or Ari Gold?,"Why is Guy working for Buddy? Probably because Ari was not around in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I am not sure.There are bunch of things about this movie that I am not sure about. But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman - and totally believable because he is a great actor.Frank Whaley's Guy is certainly out of his element working for Buddy - he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting Equal instead of Sweet & Low.Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, seems way out of Guy's league.The ending leaves a lot to be desired."
3,"Weird movie, but good!","I've never seen a movie like this before, but I was 'forced' to watch it. I thought it was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, but it's good. Just don't mix drinks with this movie!"
3,Too close to reality,"Across the top of the front on the snap case it states ""Hilarious"".I didn't find this film funny at all. Perhaps that's attributable to the differences between American and British humour. On the other hand it may be because I understand that the film depicts a situation that is not that far from reality, or any distance from it at all.This film is a very well acted drama. I wonder if the subject would have been better suited to the stage than the big screen."
3,What Goes Around Comes Around,"It is easy to believe that only pastors should do ministry and serve others. That is the easy way out for most Christian. The reality is that God wants pastors to equip us lay people for ministry. In fact God calls us to be His ministers. We have been ministered to, now it is our turn to minister: hence the name of this book, The Boomerang Mandate. What has gone around surely must come around. This little book presents clear and concise suggestions on how pastors can share ministry and its benefits with the lay people in his church. It also gives simple instructions for those doing ministry. It is not a technical book, and is quite easy to read. The author makes it real and practical by relating stories and incidents from his own ministry to introduce and illustrate various areas in which Christians can serve. This little book is well worth having."
1,Apples and Oranges,"This little book is very poorly written and not a bit useful. To compare Karl Popper with Collingwood, the greatest thinker of the 20th century, is like comparing Asimov with Einstein. It certainly doesn't work in this book, and you should not spend money for that which is not bread."
1,waste of money,"I would agree that any play set should include people, especially community helpers, however, when I ordered this set for the full price, 39.99, I felt extremely ripped off, as I then found out that there are only 18 (!) people. For 40 bucks, this absurd! Instead, I went to ebay, and found much cooler lego people, for just a fraction of the price!"
1,Description is deceitful,"I recieved a product that was advertised for 5+ years, for lego, with 30 people, 178 pieces. I got a product with 18 pieces for ages 2+ for the duplo system (legos for younger age). Based on the other review, it appears I'm not the first person to experience this issue. These people are NOT the same as the ones that come with normal lego playsets."
4,To be a detective,"It is a mystery fiction for chidlren. The editors simplied the complicated story into primary school student readable level. Furthermore, there are many interesting activities at the final part of book. They are very useful for the children to bring up the book content. The activities are not traditional comprehensive works, such as a caption for the illustration. It could provide a chance for children to guess and choose the most suitable description for the illustration. As a result, I would like to recommend this series for childnre to read.Davidoff"
4,Not the Best of Tommy or Chet,"After all, I only gave it a '4'.On the other hand, ""Ode to Mel Bay"". Oh. My sides hurt.Somehow, given the people performing, the irony is just too much to bear! Of course, that was the point."
5,"fabulous, as always","I own every CD that Tommy has recorded, barring ""greatest hits."" This one is so fun -- it kind of brings you back to his touring roots. And because Chet Atkins was one of Tommy's ""mentors"" listening to this album brings double the pleasure. You can tell they're having fun recording this album and of course the musicianship is so professional, as always. It may not be the ""best"" of each musician, but it is certainly a wonderful collaboration of two virtuoso guitarists."
4,Doesn't tell the whole story about these artists' abilities.,"Austrailian Tommy Emmanuel is a superb player and fun performer. Chet is ""the"" master whose perfection is best heard on his recordings. However the talent of each of these astounding guitarists is not as evident on this CD as fans know it to be. It's a fun album, but not representative of the abilities of either artist. Nevertheless, it is a ""must have"" for Chet fans as this is the last album he recorded before illness ended his career."
4,Most enjoyable,"First the bad news - the title track is terrible. Singing is not the forte of these gentlemen. But picking is. Which brings us neatly to the good news - the playing is excellent. To an ex-inhabitant of Oz, the medley ""Waltzing Matilda""/""The road to Gundagai"" (the NSW country town unfortunately spelt incorrectly) was especially enjoyable.Additionally, this is an especially precious CD, because I've been told that it was the last thing Chet Atkins ever recorded. The cancer that was to take his life was well advanced at this stage."
5,Great!,"This CD is a treasure. The two, best-best, guitar pickers playing memorable tunes. Can be background songs, like for a gathering or doing work, or for deep, music focusing."
3,Forgettable record,"It is hard to give an album of two genius fingerpicker guitar players 3 out of 5. But I have to, because everything depends on your point of comparison. And when I compare this record to Tommy's other records, this record totally fades. While Borsalino and Dixie McGuire are fingerpicking classics, other tracks are just high quality but easily forgettable. I could have easily lived without buying this record, even though I love Tommy."
4,Very good collaborative effort by two guitar masters,"Both Chet Atkins (sadly no longer with us) and Tommy Emmanuel (fortunately still alive and kickin', or I should say, still alive and pickin') are excellent guitarists with seemingly impossible skills. Chet, as a matter of fact, was an inspiration for Tommy when he was young, and Tommy has clearly worked on that inspiration.The CD opens with an interesting instrumental tune, ""Borsalino,"" and every song features some excellent guitar work. A couple of songs have some humorous lyrics -- ""The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World"" and ""Ode to Mel Bay"" -- but for the most part this is an instrumental CD.For fans of Chet or Tommy, or for anyone who appreciates advanced finger-style guitar-playing, I give this a definite thumbs up recommendation."
4,Finger Licking Good,Very easy listening music that is a credit to the two players. Their playing blends together seamlessly.
5,Unique CD!,"Awesome combination of Tommy Emmanuel and his guitar idol, Chet Atkins. Would love to hear some of the between take jams that took place!"
2,Bummer,This product is in good shape though I had expected a set due to the languaes of the ad. I'm considering returning this product. It shipped quickly and I'm happy with that. Its a sheet not sheets..
1,The Uncle Toms of the 21st century,"Asalamu Alaikum dear readers, It has been a long time since the Muslim ummah has lived without a state and it seems that it maybe even longer with the types of scholars who contributed to this book. It seems that these so-called scholars are perfectly in line with American Policy to delay the establishment of an islamic state. The discourse is academic and lacks the ability to motivate muslims to re-establish Islam. These orientalists, such as Jackson and Fadl don't give the muslims any incentive to work to re-establish the state. In fact the book is very discouraging. I would expect such an attack against the political infrastructure of islam to come from non-muslims. Who knows, these guys may be CIA...May Allah (SBT) protect us from these uncle toms!"
5,This book is an invaluable study on Islamic law,"Rarely has a book been published which not only entices the reader with a fascinating subject matter, but challenges one's mind so thoroughly and completely. Abou El Fadl's book is clearly the most important contribution to Islamic legal discourses this century. The content will mesmerize anyone sincerely interested in the complexity and sophistication of a forgotten tradition."
3,Too small to make a statement,"I bought these with the matching pendant because they were on sale for $20. For that price, I'm happy with the earrings. On their own they are too small to make a fashion statement, but paired with diamond studs or some gold hoops, they look really nice. The box they came in is also lovely."
2,"A Good Idea, But Disappointingly Executed","DREAM TEAM is the pilot for a television (READ: no nudity) show about three beautiful but dangerous, action-hero type women who form a... I don't know, what are all of these things? ""Super team,"" I guess, to fight bad guys while pretending to be a modeling / marketing / promotions firm. Not the worst idea in the world, but this movie is just not executed all that well. The action isn't all that exciting, the girls aren't all that likable, and the villain isn't all that charismatic. You can see why this didn't catch on and become a success. I got this because I was curious about the show, whose premise I liked, but... no. I don't remember anybody of note being in the production credits, though the cast boasts Martin Sheen. Girls look great, but they don't even do anything sexy, so... no."
3,A copy of another series,"This sounds like the premise for another series entitled ""Acapulco H.E.A.T."" and ran for two or three years. I enjoyed that show. Amazon sells the complete series or just Season 1 and Season 2. I have never seen Season 3 by itself although I think there was a Season 3."
4,An okay movie,I got the movie cause Jeff Kaake was in it. Thinking that wahoo I finally got something good. But I wouldn't give an A+. It's mostly a B cause we'll the action isn't at all real
3,"Eye Candy, not much else","A thinly disguised Charlie's Angels Rip off made for cable and turned into a shortlived series.The girls are gorgeous, the guys are gorgeous, so there is something to stare at, but the plot, direction, and acting is a yawner. An excuse for models posing.Pleasant enough, but I suggest getting it used!!!Gave it for 4 stars, and that is for McShane's performance the was the only bright spot in the acting department."
1,Would purchase again.,"The delivery was quick, just using regular delivery and the book was just as great of shape as promised. I will purchase again in the future."
1,Inaccurate and Dangerous,"For a former accounting professor, Masters gets the numbers all wrong in this book. Using the logic in this book, Masters gets up to a 43% long-term annual return on real estate investments. In CH5 where Masters describes the source of real estate profits, the author includes paydown of a mortgage loans principal as one of the sources. In fact principle payments increase the amount invested in the property and reduces the return rather than increases it. This is just where the errors begin.Masters targets this book at neophyte small investers. My advice is that neophytes who don't have a sound understanding of finance should stay far away from this book. For anyone else it's buyer beware."
3,basic book,"its a good book but very basic. i was looking for something more detailed and was a disappointed, but if you know nothing about real estate, it'll give u a good understanding."
2,This is a bootleg,"This is a very sub-par VHS to DVD transfer. Lots of image wobble (probably due to a faulty VHS deck), the sound is barely passable.Further, it's NOT authorized and thus a bootleg. None of the performers recieve any money from the sale of this disc.Shame on Amazon for selling bootlegs."
2,Original VHS was great,"Reading the other reviews is off putting. IF this is unauthorized, that would be unfortunate. Sorry to hear the quality of the transfer is tricky. I bought two DVD not realizing that it. Perhaps I will return them unopened."
5,absolute best book i have ever read,"This book is awesome, It mentions great ways to reframe our toxic way of thinking in an optimistic approach. I would love to teach this material in a class because it affects all of us 100%. The concepts and ideas are staggering and if we apply these principles to our daily lives we are going to live longer and more productive lives as well as reduce depression, hostility and divorce. If you can read, read this book, you will not be disappointed! If you are a therapist ot teacher it would be even more beneficial for you to spread this wonderful knowledge like wildfire. thanx :)"
4,Viewed of healthy Mind and Body dated on some issues.,"I have not finished reading this book, but will give it a fair shot. So far I find some of the information to be outdated which can just be the result of how fast Medical information is progressing. Overall this is a great book and should be of help to those interested in the correlation between Physical and Mental Health."
2,Color in picture not true to life,"Color was not the vibrant, electric lime green that was depicted in the photo online. More of an olive. I was disappointed about this."
4,"LOVE, perfect accent on bedroom wall","Super easy to apply and re-apply. Really changes my bedroom and enhances a giant wall that needed to be broken up. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the same reason as other similar reviews: the color is NOT as bright as in the picture (which, in my case, works out just fine)."
4,A very clever plot,"I've just started reading Ngaio Marsh's mysteries, so I don't know if this book is a ""typical"" Marsh mystery, but I certainly hope so. The characters were well-drawn, and the plot quite brilliant. A man dies while playing darts, because it appears that a dart daubed with cyanide sticks in the back of his hand. Almost everyone has a motive, and the evidence at hand can point to almost any of them. Reading this novel is like threading a conch-shell. You slip in a piece of string and it snakes through various chambers and entries until it finally comes out at the end. I was a big Christie fan, but now I think I'll be moving on to Marsh."
4,Dart over to this one!,"Perhaps not one of her more richly written efforts, but buoyed by a marvellous mystery plot, set in a wonderful English pub. Darts and beer, a fatal combination."
4,New to Amazon,I had a good experience with my purchase and I am enjoying my product andwould do it again.
5,So simple and easy to make using store-bought candy.,"What a clever little cookbook, I say little because it's a stocking stuffer size but it is a 160 pages. There's a recipe for oatmeal cookies made with raisinets. It was so yummy. Another recipe was Peanut Butterfinger Pie, made using Oreos and Butterfingers. OMG, it was to die for. It would be wonderful to take to the company Christmas party. All of the recipes are made using brand name candy. It's not a cookbook to make the candies as someone else mentioned. These are pies, bars, cookies, tarts, coffee cakes, etc made using Milky Way, Junior Mints, Snickers, Hershey's Kisses, Jolly Rancher's, and many many more.This is an awesome cookbook that everyone needs around the holidays. It even has seasonal recipes so you can make a 4th of July Trifle using Nestle White Crunch bars. There's Necco Sweethearts Cupcakes, Easter Bunny Fondue, and again many more."
5,Better each time I read it,"Full of historical and cultural information, while keeping mostly clean in light of its content, 'By Right of Conquest' gives a balanced picture of Cortez and the Aztecs. Though it deals with horrifically violent events, they are written non-descriptively. The characters are easy to relate to and the story is interesting. Roger doesn't always do what is right, but his aim is always to do righteously and he looks out for others more than for himself. Highly recommended for those who enjoy historical fiction or want to study this time period or culture."
5,Great for good elementary readers too,"If your child or student doesn't like historical fiction, try them on this one. They won't be able to put it down. The book also has enough period details to make it great supplemental reading for an American history unit."
5,old favorite,"I never wanted to 'get into' dancing or acting as a child, but this book makes theworld of a child theatrical performer (70 years ago) come alive. I read this so many times. It was just so entertaining. Great book!"
5,Fun for kids,My daughter loves Ballet Shoes so we bought Dancing Shoes. We were not disappointed. Noel Streatfeild is a wonderful author.
5,the Best book in the world,"if only I could write like that! I loved the book. I am currently reading it for the second time. If you have not read it even once, you should. you will never regret buying it!"
2,Poor Quality binding and paper,I bought this book as a gift and have not read it. This was a disappointment as I have bought children's books from Amazon for a number of years and most have been at least adequate. Especially for the price. I didn't gift this book and instead gave a DVD.
5,Presence of Holy Spirit,"This praise and worship songs are so inspiring, I start every day whit song "" Holy"" and I know Holy Spirit is whit me all trough the day. Just the way Jesus promised, He will be with us always.Trough this song I feel Holy Spirit,Comforter is whit me all day.thank you Donnie."
4,The Prayer.....fabulous,"""The Prayer"", i think, will forever be one of my favorites. I used and at my wedding, i play it all the time. When i hear it on the radio, i still get goose-bumps. Really great song and well done guys."
4,Donnie did it Again,"I liked it. I love Donnie McClurkin and his love for God shows through his music. This CD doesn't have as many upbeat songs on it as the last one, but the songs are good. It may not be the best, but it will make a great addition to your gospel music collection."
2,Reader from Glendale CA,Agree with the reader from Glendale about the prior reviews. Please contct me so we discuss. Colorado78@yahoo.com
1,Not the quality I would expect from National Geographic,"We bought these for my son, who was very eager to have a pair of working walkie-talkies. They work well, at a substantial distance, HOWEVER, when you are not actually speaking into them (i.e.,pressing the 'talk' button) they emit a continuous, loud, unbearable static noise. With all of today's technology, it's hard to believe they couldn't manufacture something better."
1,Worthless!!,My wife bought these for our two sons (4 and 3 years old) also a set for my nephews (8 and 5 years old). We thought we better test them before we gave them as gifts. They are worthless. At 15 feet I could barely hear my wife. The static is so loud when you are not pushing the talk button that you can't even stand to have them on for more than a minute or two. Don't waste you time with these. We are taking back both pairs in the next day of two.
5,Wonderful loving memories about my dad,"I'm 63 now and a grandmother. When Mike Douglas had his tv talk/variety show, he had a big selling record, ""The Men In My Little Girl's Life"". This record tells a story from the beginning of his little girl's introduction to boys and continues on through the teenage years, marriage and motherhood. Every time I hear that song, I cry because it makes me think of my dad. I have tried for years to find this song to pass along to my son (whose wife gave birth to a darling little baby girl, who is now 6). This year I purchased the CD for my son's birthday (thanks to Amazon). I know he has the same love for his little girl now that my dad had all those years for me. My son will continue to have these strong, loving feelings until she becomes a mom too. Thank you so very much for the loving moments I have relived and shared with my son because of this song. I love you, Dad, from your daughter, Sharon. (My face is wet with tears.)"
2,"Interesting, but slipshod","I would've enjoyed this book more if it had been fact checked a little more diligently. It claims 'Billy Elliot' was nominated for a single award, when it actually received three nominations, and says the last time a sweep occured before 'LOTR: Return of the King' was 'Gigi' in 1958, when in fact it was 1987's 'The Last Emperor'.If it can get details like this wrong, it's easy to believe that other, less checkable, stories might be false as well."
2,PLEASE read this before making purchase,"This CD should come with a warning: the single/video/radio version is not on this Maxi-single. And it does not have 7 different remixes. One is an a cappella version (of the remix). Three are dubs/instrumentals. The last track is another song (which I did not enjoy). Do the math [8 - 1 - 3 - 1 = 3] and what remains is 3 versions that are not accommodating to a trip down early-1990s-music memory lane, and are not that different from one another. So again, unless the remixes are what U want - DON'T BUY THIS CD. If I already had the original version, this Maxi-single would not have been such a waste of my money."
4,Cleans Well - But Annoying Packaging,"Thse Finish Powerballs do a good job cleaning dishes, but my one compaint....they come packaged in individual tiny plastic wrappers which makes them a hassle to open and doesn't seem particularly environmentally friendly."
5,Excellent,"These dishwashing tablets clean your dishes very well, do not leave spots, and have a nice fresh orangey scent. They also dissolve well in the dishwasher -- no clumps are left behind. I would gladly recommend this product."
5,No more powder spills!,"Finish Powerball Tablets are easy to use, pre-measured capsule/cubes that fit into your detergent dispenser. No more spilled powder, wasting detergent. Dishes are cleaner than other powders and liquids I've tried, and also spot-free, thanks to the built in rinsing agent. The orange scent is pleasing without being overpowering."
4,works for me,"first off, i hate cleaning dishes so i use my dishwasher A LOT. i do rinse off my dishes before putting them in for wash so i don't really have any issues with ""stuck-on"" foods.these tablets do a decent job, just like any other tablets i've used. however, these are individually packaged in a small plastic wraps. they are not the type with disintegrating packaging. i'm an extremely lazy person so having to rip the plastic and then walk all the way to the garbage can, wait for the motion sensor of the garbage can to detect me and open the lid, just to discard the wrapping, becomes very tedious. if you don't doing all that work, dishes and glasses come out stain-free and clean.overall, i'm very satisfied with this product. i'd give 4.5 stars if i could."
2,Not a Two Pack,"This is listed as a Two Pack and 18 cents per unit. But only one box of 20 ships, for 35 cents per unit."
5,Does a great job!,"Used it and it works well, doesnt leave a nasty smell, buildup on anything and doesnt do anything weird in your dishwasher. I do not like heavy smelling cleaners and this isnt heavy smelling. It cleans and works just like it says it will. I will continue using these in the future as well. Sometimes I needed to put more then one tablet in the washer to get the dishes clean and you only need one of these!"
5,works great,"I got a sample of these in a mailing one day, and could not believe how well they worked. I love the orange scent in stead of the traditional lemon one. Much nicer on the noise, and works great have not notice any buildup or spots on the glasses"
3,Just Okay,"These are okay for the price but you can find them cheaper when they go on sale at your local grocery store or Target. They seem to do the trick but aren't ""spectacular""."
4,On-line price matches or beats in-store price for me,"Finish is the only brand of dishwasher detergent that works in my machine. Both Powerball and Quantum by Finish are excellent. I usually buy these in the grocery store only when they are on sale, but I saw these on Amazon at I price I rarely beat in the store, so I ordered a couple of boxes. Would definitely order again at this price."
5,Works Great!,"Dissolves fully, works great on getting stuck on food off dishes. If you're like me and rinse your dishes before placing them in the dishwasher, Finish Powerball is fantastic. No more having to ""fingernail pick"" bits of stuck on food after taking your dishes out of the washer. Finish Powerball is fantastic!"
3,Okay but not as good as previous model.,I used to have one of these scoops that had nitrogen or something of that nature in the handle and it was amazing. I couldn't find that exact model so I had to try this one. It's not nearly as good. The handle is comfortable to hold but it doesn't make up for the cost. It's a cool ice cream scoop but I expected it to cut through the ice cream way better.
1,Poor service,You'r sending the staples right away and the staple gun in approximately a month later according to the delivery date. It stated 4 instock when I placed the order. This is poor service. What cane I due with just the staples?
4,Elegant looking...,"If you like the classics then this is a good one. Pretty and very simple. Shipping was superfast, I didn't pay any extra, so I like that. The diamond is just a chip but then what do you want for the price. I'm very happy with the earrings."
5,Best value for your money,"I work on a cruise ship where we deal with people from lots of different countries, but mainly Europe. I was AMAZED at the extensive vocabulary, and translation accuracy this program offered. Not only does it translate into different tenses, but is remarkably accurrate. It does a MUCH better job than most on the market. It seems a little pricey, but it works and as far as I am concerned, it is a worthy investment if you need written communication with people who speak French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian."
1,Not so great for Japanese,"I purchased this product to gist a large number of Japanese documents and found the software to be pretty ineffective. In retrospect, I should have noticed that both positive reviews on Amazon appear to be from Spanish speaking individuals."
1,Does not run,"This program does not run on all systems. I have a standard, not-too-old, Pentium II(233)Gateway laptop with 256 RAM. The program installed correctly, but when I tried to run it two different ""fatal error"" messages appeared. The program then shut down. L & H said that this happens on some systems; they do not know why. The company was helpful and offered to refund my money.The French and German essays that I wanted translated were ones that I had read and made notes on several years ago, and I wanted translations for my files. In the time that it has taken to straighten out the computer problems, I could have re-read much of this material! L & H cannot refund time."
4,Durable,"I use this for workouts. The timers, stopwatch and countdown timer are perfect. It has also lived through a very hot summer in the garage which every stopwatch I've had did not make it!"
2,"Book filled with under lining, advertised as Like New","Great Book to Read, but vendor did represent book fairly. Advertised as ""Like New"", but filled with under lining.So it goes, book was a gift and it was a big disappointment."
4,Good Moral Lesson,Horatio Alger does a great job of portraying the really hard times that some young boys had to endure just to make ends meet.
5,Pimsleur Works for Me!,"I've bought various language aids over the years, but never really got far with them. The Pimsleur method of learning solely through audio recordings helped me stick with it. The beauty of this system is that it allows you to immerse yourself in learning vocabulary and gets you to start speaking immediately. I highly recommend it as the initial purchase for a language you have never studied before (but it's great for review as well). The words are broken down phonetically, and phrases introduced in the beginning are reinforced in later lessons. I also have found that not incorporating the written aspect to studying a language at the start lets you simply learn to speak it, without getting hung up on learning new characters. You can always learn those later."
3,Decent audio guide to a confusing language,"I really like the Pimsleur series. What you learn sticks pretty well due to the repetition.However, Mandarin is just so ridiculously complex and different from English, that trying to learn it just through CD's is almost a joke."
2,unclear description,"I thought it has a book, but instead it's just a couple of CDs, not that the quality is bad. But Chinese is such a visual language, it's not enough to learn it without a book."
3,Good program for conversational Mandarin.,"This course is good for learning conversational Mandarin Chinese. However, if you want to learn the language, it is not a good reference. It does not involve Pinyun pronounciation, a requirement for learning Mandarin. It also has no written material, which is also needed. The overall format is poor.If you are learning simple Chinese for a visit to China, this will help you, providing a Beijing-accented dialect that will get you through many situations. However, if you want to learn serious Mandarin, you will be better served with a different progran than this one."
5,Mandarin Chinese,"These CD's were worth twice the price. Knowing absolutely nothing about Mandarin, I listen to them while driving and amazingly, I find myself remembering and correctly pronouncing Mandarin. Languages are difficult for me and I had a special mental block about the difficulty of Mandarin.Anyone who wants to/needs to begin learning Mandarin should buy these CD's."
3,"Good, comprehensive review","I purchased this to learn some Chinese to help me when exchange students visited. I spent about 2 weeks with it. I haven't re-visted it since then. I progressed well using this during my commutes between home and work. I recommend this for folks that want to learn Chinese ""passively"" while working out (I-Pod) or durring a commute. Learning to read and write, etc., would require something with a workbook."
5,delivers exactly what it promises,"I've used these CDs (on my iPod) for several weeks now. Pimsleur delivers exactly what it promises: Instant Conversation. It's not in depth Mandarin, but that's not why I bought this. I'm planning on going to China in a few months, mostly because I want to try out my new skills."
4,Mandarin Chinese in 30 minutes a day,This is an excellent tool for learning Mandarin Chinese. I would have given it a 5th star but feel it should have been explained that you would need to purchase additional CDs to learn the language.
5,A Must for all Northern Exposure fans out there,"This book is a must for all Northern Eposure fans out there! Chris' insight into love, life and the whole karmic enchilada will give you smiles and possbily provoke some inner reflection on how you view the world.A great book!(Wish I lived in their world in Cicely Alaska)"
3,A fan out here.,"Any fan of Jane's knows that Stop and Three Days are among the best of the best songs that they have produced. They also know that the singles that Jane's release never have anything other than a demo on them. Never a soilid remix or an unreleased track for the fans. And maybe we are spoiled (those of us that are the die hard fans) to even have anything at all like Stop or Three Days (which is considered to be the Stairway the Heaven of that generation by many) in our collections. Please though, could you throw us a bone? Anyway, The demo of I would is as delicate and tender as you could hope for. Not as much passion as the version on the live triple X release, but it is different and unique if you do not own it. I would only reccommend it if you are a diehard collector though. If you own the mother albums of these tracks than you don't really need this one."
5,Like this Max and Ruby version better than the Nick one.,"I actually like the version of Max and Ruby on this series better than the one on Nick. I would rather have the actor speak for them instead of the voices on the TV show. The characters seem more polite on this series than on the Nick version too. My 3 year old girl loves Max's Chocolate Chicken story the best.Again, these are not the same exact stories as on Nick."
2,OK but not Good,shirt was very old and had a thick layer of dust on it. I washed it so it was OK. Funny sizing though. Go larger on thier sizes.
4,Sushi set,This product looks very durable and authentic. I have not used it because I bought it for my husband as a gift.
4,Cool gift set.,"I purchased this sushi kit for my sister for her birthday, a sushi lover, and uses it every time we make some.-Very good quality of the items included, which have two of each: plates, sticks, bowl for soy sauce, and 2 little wooden things to place your chopsticks on.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is I wish it came with 4 of everything, but not a bad price for 2."
3,"I like it, but didn't need all the pieces","I think this is a good product but we really only use the chop sticks and the soy sauce bowls, the other items are pretty useless."
4,Another Happy Taylor of Old Bond Street Purchase,"Even applied directly from the jar to the face, this shaving cream lathers nicely and smells quite pleasant (but not overpowering). I still prefer the Eton College scent, but this does rival the avocado scent for second favorite.This is the fourth Taylor of Old Bond Street tub I've bought over the years. That's not because they run out quickly: only one jar has ever actually done so. I just like their shaving creams enough to have started a small collection."
5,Great Shaving Cream,"Ever since I started shaving using soap in a bowl, Taylor of Old Bond Street has been a favorite of mine. It lathers up very nicely, and the Lemon & Lime scent is unbelievably good and refreshing. This combined with the face food of the same scent are an awesome duo and treat for the face."
2,Slow to get going,"I thought this book was very slow moving. I almost put it down but didn't. I had read ""Spirit of the Wolf"" by Karen so I thought I would give this a try. It was not as good. I like the feel of the true Indian heritage but found the exerpts from historical documents at the start of each chapter distracting and dull. The first half is very slow and it only barely picks up about half way through, For my money I would pass on this book. Borrow it from the library if you really want to read it."
1,Poor quality,"In theory this is a nice timer but the quality control is poor. I bought two of them. One worked fine, the other had a defective LCD element and then it didn't work at all. I sent it back and they returned new one. It has a similar problem. About half the LCDs are dim. The battery connection is very poor. One time I put in the battery and nothing happens. Another time it comes on but half the LCD elements are poor. If you don't mind sending it back to the manufacturer a bunch of times buy this product."
3,"Cheap, accurate","Purchased to be used for lacrosse games. Once you figure it out, it's incredibly flexible and easy to track penalties and game time simultaneously. But it's not intuitive. When asking a parent to take over for the first time, it takes a good bit of explaining.Good price point for flexibility and reliability. Willing to make the usability trade for the price."
2,"Quality Blade, but unbalanced and bulky","I bought this knife expecting a compact pocket knife. When I take it out of the box I found a knife much larger then I expected r wanted (blade at least 3.5 inches) The blade being metal and so long and the handle being some form of plastic, it is quite unbalanced in the hand. I will be returning this product, mainly because the blade excedes 3inches making it a ""dangerous knife"" in the eyes of the law but also because I just don't find it comfortable in my hand."
4,Good electro-techno hybrid disc,"Unlike the only other Advent album I own (Sketched for Life) Time Trap Technik veers from the robotic post-Detroit techno sound and at least partially embraces an electro aesthetic. I don't think they cross the line from techno to electro so much as they straddle the fence. I definitely find the CD enjoyable and recommend it to those who like minimal techno/electro. For those that like this, I would also highly recommend Gesamtkunstwerk by Dopplereffekt. Though Time Trap Technik is an excellent album, the album by Dopplereffekt is a flat-out classic."
3,"Advent, The - Time Trap Technik","The Advent have always been known for the pure techno ethos -- and with a title like TIME TRAP TECHNIK, it seems their reputation continues unabated. ""Visualize"" thrums with nice energy and its little musical glitches keep things interesting. ""Signum"" has a similar feel, though slightly more wiggly, and with its own surprising moments, and ""Wasper"" has a deep buzz to it that hints at some menace, as do the low gong tones on ""Stassis."" The stark breaks and light synth passes on ""E-Tox"" give that track some pop, but as good as the tracks are, something's missing here -- it almost feels like Mr. Ferreira is coasting. He's not pushing the envelope as much as he used to. And while not every album needs to forge completely new territory, I was hoping for a bit more."
2,save your money,Please save your money and don't purchase this review book. After doing several of the practice questions I began to realize that many of the answers in the answer guide were wrong. Some of the answers also blatantly contradicted themselves. I called the publisher to bring this to their attention and they did nothing about it. How can a person study for this caliber exam when the study material is not accurate? Don't buy this book!
2,Box torn and crushed on the gift,This is a gift and it was sent in a cardboard box but there was not enough packing around it. The inner box was crushed and torn on one corner. It was also a day late in arriving.
2,"Too much static, battery life too low","Like others, I get a lot of of static. A couple of people mentioned battery life. Mine gets terrible battery life."
1,Horrible static!,"We don't have a huge house, but have found it impossible to use these monitors because they have so much static whenever they are turned on! We are going to try and return them and purchase something that does not make so much noise!"
4,Very Sensitive,"I bought this monitor while expecting my second child. I wanted something to be able to hear if my toddler was trying to climb into the crib. This Monitor is so super sensitive, I can hear my toddler moving around in his bed at night. I can hear the covers moving. I haven't had any problems with this monitor yet, and have had it for almost 2 months. I got it on clearence at the store, and the batteries weren't very good, so had to get differant ones. I don't know if this was because it was on clearence, the batteries were just old, or if it's the brand of batteries that came with the monitor. All in all- Very Good Buy!!!"
1,don't buy,This monitor completely stopped working within two weeks of use. The company requires you to send it in and pay for shipping in order to get a replacement. I recommend paying a little more for a higher quality monitor!
1,Horrible sound quality,"I am severely disappointed in this product. This is my third baby monitor purchase (for my newborn baby), and I appalled at the lack of quality and usability. The sound quality on the parent units is terrible - there is a high pickup, and it is difficult to hear the baby at all, even when she's crying. It is difficult to sleep with it next to me at night, since I have to turn it up so loud just to be able to hear her, but then have to listen to all that background noise (even though it is not coming from her room). It happens regardless of what channel it is set on. Also, switch to select change channels (there are only 2) is very touchy, and easily changed. I found this out when somehow it got changed and I couldn't hear my baby all night. It was awful. I'm ready to chuck this thing as soon as I get a new model. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. I know there are inexpensive monitors available that do not have these faults."
2,Would not recommend,"I got this monitor as a gift at my baby shower. The very first time I used it I noticed a lot of static and humming. However, I continued to use it because I didn't have the receipt. It is very sensitive which is the only pro about it. I practically hear my daughter breathing if I turn it up the loudest!! Not reliable at all when used on battery power to be mobile. It has constant static when I walk around with it on battery power and even blacks out sometimes where it stops working. The static is the biggest down fall. If you're standing in a certain position in the house, it may be static. Sometimes when I bring my hand near the receiver, it goes haywire. Very poorly made!!"
2,You get what you pay for,My wife and I were looking for a monitor at the store Thursday night and this seemed like a reasonable buy. I guess at the price it is. But the static is so bad it is going back on Saturday. We may have to pay twice the price for something that sounds better... but we will. It's my fault for not checking the reviews on Amazon first.
2,wouldn't recommend!,"The static is horrible and you cannot hear your child, EVERYthing seems to interfere and cause more static including me sitting to close to it or it being to near other electronics. Save yourself time and money and by a different one."
2,CHEAP AND USELESS,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK WHEN WE PUT BATTERIES IN. IT HAD SO MUCH STATIC THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP WITH IT. I DID NOT RETURN BECAUSE I CHECKED IT BEYOND THE 30 DAY RETURN PERIOD. recently (two months into using it), we have no been able to use this crap at all. it produces a loud static and does not work. i had to sleep in my son's bedroom for fear that i am not going to heat him when he wakes up."
1,Too noisy,Very noisy... static sound is so loud that we can't even hear anything else. Returned and looking for something else.
2,"""First Months?""","We started using these roughly eight months ago. One of them didn't work intermittently from the beginning, and now the other is having problems. It appears to be an issue with how the contact for the batteries is made, so if you only used them on AC power this would not apply to you. They work just fine when they work, but when this little piece of metal in the battery compartment isn't making contact the unit won't work at all. Just a poor design."
3,Can hear the neighbors kid,We got this 2 1/2 years ago for my first daughter. It's worked fine until we tried to use it in a different room for our newest addition. It will ONLY pick up the signal from the neighbors' monitor (we live in an attached twin/duplex) on one channel and nothing but static on the 2nd channel. I even tried putting the monitor/base unit next to my daughter and the receiver a foot away and still heard the neighbor's daughter crying!
2,Too much static,"I have had this monitor for 7 months + now, and I loved it at first. It is super sensitive and the range is good for my house. BUT the static is now so bad that I can't hear him as well as I used to. I am now looking for another monitor and I am not happy about it. I recommend buying a different one from the start."
1,"Terrible - static, static & more static","I would return this product - but my partner threw out the packaging - so we are stuck with it. I thought our old monitor (a Graco) was bad, but this has 3x as much static. I've tried both channels - and both are bad. I can't return mine, but maybe I can save someone else the trouble - get something else!"
1,DO NOT BUY,These monitors are horrible. I've used them a total of 4 times and can't even get them to work! Static is all we hear. Now we just have to keep checking on our little one if we are downstairs and she's sleeping in her crib! Can't return since we bought them and can't find the receipt. :(
3,Was good but now...,"This monitor was pretty good for the first year. It came with a cord for each unit which was nice to have. We kept one parent unit plugged in next to our bed and kept the other mobile, so the extra cord was nice to have on trips for the base instead of unplugging the base's cord.However, then it started doing this buzzing static sound. I fiddled with it for awhile by switching cords, switching locations, and other stuff and that seemed to help until I wanted to take it somewhere. Now it is doing it again. I'm going to find a new one to replace this, which is a shame because when it works well it has great distance and clarity."
4,Great book for all ages!,"If you like sorrow, action, and adventure, you will love the book The Lantern Bearers. It is one of many great historical fiction books by Rosemary Sutcliff. This is a wonderful book about Aquila, a man in the Middle Ages, who fights alongside Ambrosis, the prince of Britain.There were many different settings in The Lantern Bearers. They were all in Britain during the Anglo-Saxon period like Ullasfjord with its harsh winters, and Arfon with its beautiful mountains. Some of these settings put me ""in the book"". For example, when Aquila was in Ullasfjord, I could almost feel the blizzards!I liked some parts of this book more than others. In some parts of the book it is a little too slow. I liked the book because most parts are exciting, like when Aquila gets married. Also it is descriptive: the author describes the characters well, like the detail of the dolphin on Aquila's shoulder. You may or may not like this book, but you will still want to read it again!"
5,I have never forgotten this book.,"With this book I began my search and exploration of the Roman world. I heartily recommend it for any brave teen wishing to join himself to that faraway world. It has been over forty years since I have read this book, however, it seems just like yesterday. I thank Ms. Sutcoliffe for this pleasure for it has propelled me on a wondrous avocation. Ave, Avila."
5,Marvelous,"This book has moved me as few books can. It starts out a little slow, as most of Sutcliff's books do, but it didn't take long for the pace to pick up. However, this book is not about action, it's about emotion. I keenly felt every single thing that the main character, Aquila, felt. I was caught up in his every emotion, urging him in my heart to go in the right direction. Normally, I don't much appreciate love stories, but the one in this book was different. I was urging him on, pleading with him to love her. I was close to tears several times; yet this is not a very emotional book, by most standards. In fact, Aquila is often the very absence of emotion. Yet somehow, Sutcliff still manages for you, the reader, to feel the emotion. I don't think there is a single book that I would recommend more; I could read it again and again."
4,"An important, provocative film","Another film I saw at Sundance in 2007 before its release on HBO. Provocative and hard hitting film with more access than you'd think possible. I already knew a lot about the Abu Ghraib situation -- but knowing and seeing it up close are two different things.One quibble is that the glossy interview style which HBO seems to require for its documentaries is somewhat at odds stylistically with the gritty subject matter.I also feel the film could have been tougher on US military prison policy in the region -- but given what must have been a very difficult situation, I'm amazed filmmaker Rory Kennedy was able to get as much access to the individual soldiers and show as much as she did."
1,Horrible,"This item is a joke.First, I expected the front to be colored (like the picture they advertise with this item), so that I could display the item. It turns out that the colored image displayed is an actual cake with colored icing.Secondly, how did they even make this cake? The clips provided to secure the 2 halves of winnie the pooh are cheap. They bend and deform. They do not secure the pan together. Every time I have tried to bake a cake, the batter oozes out of the sides.This item is NOT worth the price (unless you find it for under 10$). I wasted 30$ on this junk, and I wish I could send it back."
1,Gotta be KIDDING!! Don't risk your money !!!,"Gotta be KIDDING!! It's been exactly THREE weeks, item is paid for but not yet received, seller not responding to email. I have no number to call. Delay is understandable but at least SAY SOMETHING!! Don't risk your money, my friends!!UPDATE - 9/26/2007It's now WEEK FOUR - still haven't receive anything, no respond from seller as well. Woo-Hoo!!"
4,Good DVD,"I've had periodic bouts with back spasms and back pain for the past 6 years. I'm very lazy when it comes to doing excercises. I'd rather play tennis instead. I've had this DVD for over a year but never really did the exercises. As soon as my back got better, I would forget about it or doing any excercise. This past episode of back pain made me watch this DVD again. The DVD is informative and has interviews with back Drs and physical therapists. They attribute back pain to muscle imbalances. The video shows a shortened version of Tai Chi designed to develop the core/stabilizing muscles of the body, along with improving the posture and increasing flexibility. The instructions were very patiently explained and easy to follow. The positions are easy to learn and did not strain my back.I don't know how long I will keep doing these exercises. However, I do enjoy it. And I think it helps."
5,Great Basic Yoga Poses,"I am an OT in a school for developmentally disabled children, and this is a good tool for me to use when students need some movement. I especially like the picture of each stretch or pose; I can show it to my group and they do a good job of imitating it. The cards are on heavy stock and come in a nice easy-to-transport box. I highly recommend this product."
1,Oh please!,"Oh please! These illustrations are AWFUL and the cutsey text and made up names for some of the poses are just dreadful. Do your kids a favor and leave this item in the store. Babar's Yoga For Elephants is a much better bet. If you want your kids to do yoga, sign them up for a good yoga class--don't let them practice at home-they could get hurt."
1,YAWN,"This movie is really boring and seems like it was made by someone who has lost their way. While the film Trust is a great, great movie, stuff like Fay Grim that has followed is junk in comparison. A lot of Hartley films since Trust have been mediocre at best, mostly junk. There's a ton of Hal Hartley books and fluff about how great he is supposed to be, with striking ""I'm an artist"" poses on the cover, but this is just self indulgent dross. It seems like Hartley got too full of himself with the underground success of Trust, and has been assuming that anything he does is some great masterpiece, all the while failing to see that it sucks. With a fan base that won't tell the truth, how would he know? I'm just saying what any true honest fan should say, and I'll probably get shot down by others on this review. This will only prove my point however."
5,a sequel even better than the first,"a gorgeous sequel to ""henry fool"", twists upon twists to the point of non-sense, and yet fully believable (in a ""suspension of disbelief"" kind of way :), another masterpiece by hal hartley. note: the most important actor in this film is parker posey, not jeff goldblum"
2,Really awful,"After reading good reviews for this movie, I was expecting a good, offbeat movie with Jeff Goldblum and Parker Posie. I was really disappointed. The acting is horrible and the movie is hilarious in a cheesy bad way. The characters are unbelieveable (Jeff Goldblum trying to be a straight G-man) and one fails to feel any attachment to any of them. The action sequences are laughably bad and the score is distractingly low budget - I'm not sure if they were supposed to be funny (?). The ending is abrupt and disappointing. One of the worst produced movies I've seen in awhile."
2,"Disapponting, not in the same league as""Indecent Exposure""",I was thrilled to find a new Tom Sharpe when looking through the shelves at the airport. Just what I needed for a week on the beach in Fiji. Sadly though it stuttered and fired here and there but never really lived up to his earlier classics. Characters of interest were developed and then disappeared leaving many questions unanswered. It was a shame that I finished this book so quickly then left Captain Carelli's Mandolin on the plane unfinished. I will just have to buy it again.
2,Save your money,"I've long been a Tom Sharpe fan, but ""The Midden"" just doesn't live up to his previous books. Three specific criticisms:(1) it's just not very funny. Sure, there are occasional amusing passages, but nothing that gives rise to the uncontrollable laughter we've come to expect from Sharpe.(2) a lot of the writing is gratitously nasty. Sharpe's writing has always been 'edgy', and that's okay ... but here he includes long irrelevant passages, filled with unnecessarily coarse language. The personal attacks on Margaret Thatcher and John Major strike an unpleasant note, too.(3) much of the book reads like a badly done pastiche of ""Blott on the Landscape"" and ""Riotous Assembly""."
4,Men in Sports,"the book arrived just in time for the class to start. It was in good shape, as well. Thanks."
4,Light and Entertaining,"This early book of Saxon Bennett's delivers an enjoyable story and the promise of a growing talent.Her trademark humor is here, as is her ability to tell a story that encompasses lesbian romance in the context of the characters' entire lives. No Bennett fan will want to miss this one, and anyone looking for a nice escape will not be disappointed. It's what we all need, sometimes."
1,a very poorly written novel,I have read many novels in this genre and was very disappointed not only in the writing but that the Naiad Press would place it's name on it. I will not buy another novel written by this author and will look closer at any reviews prior to buying another book with the Naiad label.
5,Excellent! A Must Read for Self-Help fans.,"This book makes you think about life a in radically diffrent way. The book offers short but powerful stories that change your perceptions and stimulate personal growth. The title is such because the stories contain such wonderful visual imagery, the stories come alive unlike the usual self-help books. The chapters and stories are segmented so you don't have to read the book from cover to cover. You can pick it up anytime and find another nugget of wisdom. If you like this book you will love ""A Rich Man's Secret"" by Ken Roberts."
5,Rodeos and Bull Riding,"About this book ( Bull Riding and Rodeos ) I think this book sounds excellent, and challenging to read and for others. I am a student and I have to do a paragraph about bull riding and rodeos. I actually feel that this book will be a great resource to use.Also the book itself sounds amazing and full of interesting facts about bulls and their position as they do their dance in the ring. One thing that I do know is that bull riding is the one dangerous sports to do, but their is a huge commitment in doing this, and you have to know in what you are doing."
2,Commercial Boredom,"Casey Donovan is a talented performer and has an excellent singing voice, that said, this album is trash. The songs are faultless, but bland and forgettable as well. The album reeks of a mainstream playing-it-safe sound which is exacerbated by the rushed recording. These things are no fault of Casey's, they just highlight how the Idol method of fast production and no-depth leave shallow, indifferent footprints on the music landscape. Maybe Casey is a talented songwriter, in both music and lyrics. After listening to this album, you'd never know."
4,Ignore the Single,"If you ignore the 1st song on the CD, the single Listen With Your Heart and the last song which is a Live version of Symphony of Life from Australian Idol you actually have a really good CD.Looking forward to hearing more from you Casey. You got my vote all along. Keep it real, youre a breath of fresh air in a stagnant world full of over produced pop music. I only gave the CD 4 stars due to the 1st and Last songs, personally I think they are just wrong on this CD."
5,Musicology at its best!,"I respect Bernstein even more as a scholar of music and languages than I do as a conductor. I thought this was an inspired literary work of his, really. For example, his explanation of musical motive in Beethoven's 5th Symphony where we are shown that Beethoven has taken the common coda form, TA TA TA DUM, that many classical works end with, and turned it to a motive from which derives the motion and power of HIS entire symphony. That is Bernstein at his most insightful and brilliant. Wonderful! Illuminating! I would never have thought of things that only a conductor and musicologist can otherwise understand and explain. Thank you Lenny, we love you!"
3,Is strongest when considering music,"The Unanswered Question, the transcript of six lectures delivered at Hardvard in 1973, outline a new theory of music. Inspired by work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists, Bernstein attempts to find a system of musical grammar analagous to that of language. This is the weakest part of the book. He makes strained generalizations and is attempting to show something that quite possibly isn't true. Starting with the third lecture, however, his work becomes stronger. He includes an efficient analysis of Beethoven's Pastorale Symphony without any extramusical associations. Then he proceeds (with musical examples) to trace the ""twentieth century crisis"" in music and how Schoenberg and Stravinsky derived different ""solutions."" This is the strongest past of the book, and certianly worth suffereing through the first two weaker lectures. ""The Unasnwered Question"" is strongest for raising questions rather than answering them."
5,The best yet,"Katy Munger has done it again, only better. Revisiting Casey Jones is as much fun as ever and the action is swift and clever. I really like lead characters that are human, with human foibles and weaknesses, rather than the infallible cardboard ones found in so many mysteries. Casey Jones is not perfect. Which is probably the thing I like best about her. Bad To The Bone is terrific."
3,Enough in this series,"This was the second book I have read in this series (Legwork being the other one), but I think there were other books between these. I've just had enough of Casey. She hasn't kept my interest, I don't care that much about her and she is just too ""out there"" for me. The writing and descriptions are fine, the story was believable and interesting, but I can't bring myself to pay money for any more books in the series. (I found this free as I search often and ""buy"" free on a regular basis.) I also wouldn't bother to download any more free ones."
2,Dull,"I have read and loved every one of Katy Mungar's previous books, but this one I did not like. In Bad to the Bone I felt there was just nothing there that was able to hold my interest and keep me reading. I put the book down halfway through and put it in the ""book exchange"" bag without even caring how she solved everything. All of her other books I would get up in the middle of the night after a couple of hours sleep to finish reading - I couldn't bring myself to put them down. Bad to the Bone - in my opinion - was true to it's title."
5,She Just Keeps Getting Better.,"Casey Jones made her first appearance in 'Death of a Dream Maker' by Katy Munger (who, at that time, was writing under the name of Gallagher Gray) At the time, Casey was just a big, badass girl PI with more moxie than brains. Beginning with ""Legwork"", Casey has gotten tougher and sexier, but the character has also gotten deeper and more complex with every book, revealing more and more of the reasons behind the anger that drives her. The book cover mentions Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton, but Casey is a lot more interesting to me than either Stephanie Plum or Kinsey Millhone ever were. I would compare Katy Munger's work more to Robert Crais due to the depth of characterization and the way she digs deeper into the character with every book.""Bad to the Bone"" is the best Munger yet. Check it out. And all the other ones as well.Dusty"
3,Not that I didn't like it but...,"I believe it's important to note that this film is not necessarily a true story. The book was never verified, as the people were all dead the next time someone went back, therefor the account can not be stated as fact. There is also another film which tells the story slightly differently. I'm not sure which is older since I can't find the reference anywhere, but it's out there. This was a decently amusing tale, and a great demonstration of how colonists used the indigenous to further their own causes."
3,Perry Joins The Band,"Journey was founded by Greg Rollie and Neal Schoen who left Santana. The band's first few albums were more on the experimental side, with long jams and not alot of structure. In 1977, they were persuaded to bring Steve Perry into the fold. This move proved to be a successful one as their first album together, Infinity, was a big hit. The album is made up of FM radio friendly songs that were perfect for stadium tours. ""Wheel In The Sky"" and ""Lights"" are staples of the classic rock format and although they are a bit overplayed, they are solid songs. ""La Do Da"" is a strong rocker and ""Patiently"" is a good power ballad that would become the band's forte."
5,Infinity journey,I have always been a Journey fan. Love the Cd!! Will recommend to my friends!! I have most of the old Journey albums. I am also have Steve Perry's albums. Great music!! ~
1,Stinks,"Steve Perry came thru good, but the instrumentation was lousy, and this is remastered! Pfoohey! My vynyl is better. I want my money back. Don't think I'll buy Legacy products again."
2,High and Low Moments,"This disc is not terribly exciting, but it certainly does have its moments. Skip ""Wheel in the Sky"" and ""Lights,"" which have been beaten to death by America's mundane radio stations, and you come to the highlight of the recording: ""Feeling That Way/Anytime."" This duo of songs represents the Rolie-Schon-Perry partnership at its best -- soaring vocals, dramatic guitar work, and a solid, pounding rhythm. They truly deserve the title ""classic rock.""I can't say much for the remaining material on ""Infinity,"" but I do recommend it -- if only for the above-mentioned songs."
3,1970s Jock Rock Uneven,"I'm chagrined to admit that I loved this album in high school like so many jocks in the class of 1979. Twenty-five years later I bought the CD to indulge my nostalgia and guilty pleasure and realize I truly was an embarrassment. However, there are some classic rock songs that based on their genre hold up pretty well. Wheel in the Sky, Lights in the City, and a couple other tracks really capture the 1970s suburban rock zeitgeist. But Winds of March, a ballad I loved when I was 16, is so pretentious that it was probably fodder and inspiration for the film This Is Spinal Tap."
2,No Bonus Tracks,"I give it two stars because I agree with all of the reviews that state it as a repackaged and not a re-remastered release. I suspect it's because this INFINITY and EVOLUTION have no bonus material added to them, so they got lazy and just repackaged them. All of the other Journey cd's that have the bonus material sound better than the 1996 versions, and along with the remastered Steve Perry solo cd's they are worth buying. If you have the 1996 versions of the above two cd's INFINITY and EVOLUTION don't repurchase these."
2,"Reissue, not rematered","Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)."
3,Remastered? Drums are still muddy,"This is the best album by this band. It was my hope they had really done a remaster but from listening to the drums on La Do Day they area still undefined and muddy. I suspect the masters are this way. Too bad, someday someone with real remaster talent will tackle this."
1,"An EXCELLENT Rock work... But the ""ENHANCED"" CD version REALLY SUCKS...!!!!","I don't understand why these weird ""geniuses"" at Sony/Columbia issued this series of ""ENHANCED"" CDs. I have had lot of problems playing this album and other similars, in older CD players (Home/portable/car).This ""Infinity"" is a real milestone of American Rock music... But in this ""ENHANCED"" version, it SIMPLY SUCKS!!!! If possible, try to get an older European issue (Italy, Germany or U.K.). Same sound quality, no playing problems at all!!!!"
3,"works, but can be messy","It's fascinating to watch the multi-colored mildew grow on the crystals - once assembled this dehumidifier works well and is an inexpensive solution to a temporary problem. If I had an ongoing problem, I'd buy a real dehumidifier, and as it is, I'll never buy this product again. It's difficult to assemble without getting the beads all over the counter - which is worrisome because I have no idea what sort of chemical this is, and if you get it on your hands, it leaves an odd dry sliminess that's difficult to wash off. The same is true for the liquid the product soaks up - again, amazing, it becomes full of water and can be surprisingly much fuller than you realize. The first time I picked one up to discard it, I ended up spilling some of the ""water"" on my floor, hands and clothes, all of which was difficult to wash out.Upshot is, it works. But it's chemically messy."
5,Clear and to the point,"I have been a follower of the Fourth Way ideas for the past twenty years, and during that time I have read almost everything. Once in a while I have had the ""good fortune"" of meeting such pearl of wisdom as this book. The author treats each topic, and all of then are really related with the inner work of change, with clarity and the experience of someone not just ""explaining"" the concepts. He speaks (that was my feeling) from the point of view of someone who has not only practiced what he talks about, but more importantly, who have become the words, wich, after all is the goal of every true way.Since finding this book I went looking for his other works, bought then and to my soul happyness, they were all like that: Precise, practical, clear and very human. Go for it. You will never regret."
5,An original and deep book,"Mr. Haven expression of the Fourth Way qualifies it for inclusion with the great exponents of that tradition in this century: Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Collin and Nicoll. I am grateful that I found this book."
2,An ambitious but flawed attempt,"The author has attempted far too much with too little research and attention to fact. Taking various pairs of confusable words she ostensively offers the reader a better understanding of their true differences. Unfortunately, not only does she fall short of this goal but far too often gets her facts wrong. For example: There are now five, not ""three great kingdoms into which all natural objects have been classified."" (P.209). A supernova is not a ""nova that that suddenly explodes into dazzling brilliance."" (p. 218). The alpaca is not a ""domesticated llama."" (p. 198). Scorpions are not ""insects"" (p.206). And, tidal waves are not ""any destructive sea wave caused by strong winds."" (p. 227). These are inexcusable errors of fact. Let the the reader beware or go elsewhere."
5,"""Living"" the Christian Life","I've been a Christian for over 25 years and this text is the most effective piece I've ever read on the subject of living the Christian Life. In our goal oriented society, the pressure to perform is more than God requires. Michael Wells explains in very human terms our responsiblity is to abide in him and God's responsiblity is to grow the fruit. God has made revolutionary changes in my faith and behavior as a result of me understanding the contents in this book written by Michael Wells. This book is a little known gem. You would be wise to take it to heart."
1,"What a shame, corruption !","UNBELIEVABLE this is has been produced !!!!! 4 titles of "" in Munich "", and they have been given it another title to mislead you !!! And the last song comes from "" Miles Electric "" different kind a blue. A very bad copy and mono sound recording ! They should find those guys and put them in jail. I tought I got some new stuff by Miles, but they tricked me. Unbelievable."
2,"STORY IS GREAT, BUT DOWNLOAD IS AWFUL!!!","THE STORY IS GREAT! THE KINDLE DOWNLOAD IS TERRIBLE THOUGH. WITH 1'S FOR THE LETTER L AND HORRIBLE MISS-SPELLING, I AM SHOCKED I PAID FOR THIS. THE ERRORS ACTUALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO READ!"
5,Bone Thugs are the best rappers there are!,"This CD is the greatest! Bone Thugs are the best, fastest rappers out there. I especially liked ""1st of the month"" and ""land of the heartless."" I was kind of surprised that the song ""Crossroad"" was different then the song on the video, but it's a damn good song anyway. Buy it now!"
5,Unique,Definately Bones best album but for tha cat who said was the first album earlier was wrong. Did u forget about Thuggish Ruggish Bone on Crept and We Came which was the second cd they released. While the first one was Bone Enterprise Faces of Death. This is their third cd so go and the the first two they damn near as good as this one.
5,Track list,"I see there is no track list so here it is:Track Listing1. Da Introduction2. East 19993. Eternal4. Crept And We Came5. Down '71 (The Getaway)6. Mr. Bill Collector7. Budsmokers Only8.

5,Greast Bone Classic,"This is a wonderful bone album to have thoe I think btnh Resurrection is alot better the tightest songs are 1,2,4,6,7,8,10,12,13,16,17 classic songs are 3,4,5,9,15 all right songs are ,11. ""may God bless you and keep you"""
5,ITS THE SH**TS,"BONE IS THE SH**TS ALL THERE SONGS ARE GOOD.E.99 ETERNAL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE OF ALL THEIR CDS. I LIKE THEIR GANGSTER RAP AND HOW THEY RAP FAST. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THEIR ARE DA INTRO,E.99,LAND OF THA HEARLTLESS,AND MO'MURDA. ALL THE OTHER SONGS ARE GOOD TO. IF YOU LIKE GANGSTER MUSIC THIS CD IS FOR YOU PLUS ALL THEIR OTHER CDS.LIKE I SAID BONE IS THA MU********IN SH**TS .I RECCOMEND TO YOU TO BUY THIS CD."
3,BT&H,Over all the CD is pure BT&H...but I was really disappointed in the change they made to Tha Crossroad...it's nothing like the original which was an awesome song.
3,Maybe I've outgrown this type of music,"I got this album because I liked these guys flow and melody on the few tracks that I had heard from them. Also the reviews featured universal appeal. Well, I bought the album expecting there to be some violence, but I was not expecting it to be the trending theme throughout. It was way too much for my liking. The talk of killing was depressing, and unapologetic. I'm a huge rap fan, one of the biggest you'll ever meet, so I know violence is apart of much of rap music. This album just took it to another level and used that violence and glorified it. I'm sure some people are not bothered by this (the 200+ positive reviews don't lie), but I am. So just know that before you purchase this album. A positive? It does have good beats and the guys flows are on point. Also, 1st of the Month and Crossroads are hip hop classics."
4,Good but it doesn`t have anything Creepin` on oh Come Up,This Album is good but it is not as good their ep because that was harder and had funkier beats.This is good too.I would suggest them both for Rap fans.Both Classics.
4,awesome album,"I am very glad I purchased this album! As a MUSICIAN I take delight in finding aspects of melody, syncopation, and harmony in a RAP album. The subject matter may be a little intense for some listeners but in all honesty what else would you expect from ""Bone THUGS n Harmony""? Overall, awesome album. I'm beginning to look into purchasing the other albums by this group."
5,"BONE THUGS ARE THE BEST, YA HEARD","YOU DONT HAVE TO LIKE RAP TO LOVE THIS CD. I LUV RAP, BUT THIS DRAWS IN ALL TYPES OF FANS. YOU WILL LUV THE THUGS HARMONIZING CHANTS OVER GOSPEL TINGED BEATS. ""THA CROSSROADS"" TIED A RECORD SET BY THE BEATLES FOR FASTEST RISING POP SONG EVER! IT'S A TOUCHING SONG, SHOWING THE THUGS' REALIZATION OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY...BONE THUGS ARE THE BEST RIGHT NOW, AND THEIR NEW CD IS GON BE HOT TOO! BUCK BUCK BUCK BUUUUCK!"
5,.,I'm not usually a fan of rap/hip-hop but I love this album...It does'nt sound like any other rap and and is very unique.
5,bone did it again,WHEN I HEARD THIS I KNEW BONE WAS THE BEST NOBODY CANT BEAT BONE DA INTRODUCTION FREAKY AND WEIRD THATS WHY ITS FRESH EAST 1999 TOO FRESH CROSSROADS SUPER FRESH CREPT AND WE CAME OH BABY MY NIGGA BIZZYS ON DAT FRESHEST BONE IS BIZZY WHAT MOE CAN I SAY ALL THE SONGS IS DA BOMB BUDAH LOVAZ MAKES ME FEEL HIGH AND YOU KNOW HOW AFTER YOU HEAR A REALLY GOOD CD YOU KEEP REPETIN VERSES OF DA SONG YUP I GAURENTEE YOU THATS GONNA HAPPEN WITH ALL THE SONGS HEY THEY CREPT AND THEY CAME UP SHOUT OUT TO BIZZY KRAZIE LAYZIE WISH AND FLESH CLEVLEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,E.1999 Eternal,"Yo man this cd is tight. I listen to this twice a week and pump Buddah Lovas up loud when im rollin. My favorte trackz on this is e.1999,down 71,Budsmokas only,Buddah lovas,mo murda,and Shotz to tha double glock. All tha otha trackz are good. Get this u wont be dissapointed."
5,CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASIC CLASSIC,"This cd is, quite simply, a land-mark achievement. If u dont own this cd, i have no idea where u have been the last 4 years or so....EVERYONE who likes rap has to own this cd, bone fan or not. If u dont own this album, your cd collection is POINTLESS. I mean, it hasnt sold over 9 million copies for no reason, it is easily one of the best selling rap albums ever... 9 million copies!!!!! Thats MORE than TWICE as much as what The Chronic sold, and equal to All Eyez On Me. Buy this cd NOW if u dont already have it."
3,3 Stars,"This album produced one of the biggest hits in hip hop history, Crossroads is some of their best work. Overall E. 1999 Eternal is an AVERAGE album."
2,What's The Big Deal,"This is the man who shot down the supposed lenged 2pac and dismantled the patheic atempt by the commerical product that is Nelly. Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony I think is nothing special. They are a group who for some reason has been shone on with too much attention and praise. The lyrics are nothing special they are predictable like Eminem and horrible like Steven Segeals acting. The beatz are pretty good, but i'd rather listen to another boring J.LO Collabration then this supposed classic album. In short this album leaves alot to be desired. THE WORST SONG I'VE HEARD SINCE 2PAC'S KEEP YA HEAD UP WOULD BE LOOK INTO MY EYES. Enough Said!"
1,violent,"I wish I never bought this CD. The beat is alright, but the lyrics are wrong, wrong, wrong! All they sing about is killing people and doing drugs. This is not the kind of music we need. If you're thinking about purchasing this, don't. We don't need to promote violence."
1,MORE STUFF THAT RHYMES WITH RAP,"Come on people, it is criminal (excuse the term) to think that rap stars who cannot sing or play instruments are passing themselves off as musicians and are receiving prestigious music awards such as the Grammy. This is a total slap in the face to GREAT musicians like Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Sly Stone, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, James Brown, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Stevie Wonder, Bud Powell, Earth, Wind, & Fire, Ella Fitzgerald, and Charlie Christian. Now, those artists are real musicians that REALLY sing and play. Bone Thugs are...well, thuggs."
5,The Legendary E.1999 Eternal,"I dont care what anyone says, this is the greatest rap album of all time...period. I baught this album almost 10 years ago and I STILL haven't gotten tired of it. A lyrical masterpiece. But tragically, Bone slowly went downhill after this album. I dont have a favorite track on this album, but one that I listen to alot is ""Mr. Bill Collector"". If you dont have E.1999 Eternal, you are seriously trippin...GET IT."
3,Crossroads is truly one of the best rap tunes,"With Easy E producing and developing this group from O-HI-O, Cleveland in the house, then it got rap cred...the Crossroads song is layered nice and the bomb"
5,Most underrated Hip Hop Album of all time,"People in the industry do not give Bone Thugs their due in hip hop. This is one of the hottest albums of all time. You constantly hear people talk about ""Reasonable Doubt,"" ""Illmatic,"" ""Ready to Die,"" ""Doggystyle"" etc. but its not fair that you mention those albums without mentioning E. 1999 Eternal. When this album came out, you heard this cd blaring out of every boombox and every car stereo on every corner. This cd is hot from start to finish. Definitely one of the greatest pieces of work in hip hop history."
5,They Crept And They Came,"Bone Thugs~N~Harmony prove once again that they are the greatest rap group every assembled, comming straight from Tha Double Glock, they are the originators of the fast rap, and with this album, they prove to be the realest and illest rappers ever, although they might not be as sick now as before, this CD is a good example of just how great they were, and also the most unique rap style that I every heared, Twista cant compare, although a lot of people think that Bone Thugs are just R&B singers, they never bothered to listen to their music, and with the lost of their mentor Eazy-E, they give a beautiful tribute to their friend on the song Tha Crossroads, which is the song that everyone know them by, but songs like Land Of Tha Heartless give a good example that they are Thugz from Theiveland, also they rap very quick, so if your new to the Bone Thug music, this and Creepin' On Ah Come Up are excellent albums, so go buy it!!!!"
5,Better Than a classic,"This CD is better than a classic. This album put Bone on the map. The best ever recorded by them was number 16: ""Mo Murda"". The beat is ridiculous, and the lyrics are just crazy. If you don't have this CD, GO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Dopest Album Out y'all,"Bone Thugs-N-Harmony has done it again yo, they crept and they came wit this dope album. i mean it'z got crossroad,shotz to da double glock, mo murda it'z got everything on a album y'all could ever want. i just gotz ta credit dem on a once again dope album."

4,"Do you like creepy? Good, because this is creepy.","Though I haven't yet read all of Simenon's (possibly) one million novels, I can say that November is arguably the best non-Maigret book that he wrote. Simenon was a master of small-scale drama, and this book is no exception. All he gives us is a house, a daughter, mother, father, son and a maid. Of course, it wouldn't be Simenon if both the son and father weren't sleeping with the maid, and everyone else in the house knew it. This, of course, makes for the creepiness. This book is a good 10 on the CreepOmeter. I highly recommend it."
4,Good stuff,"I liked ""Ram"" when it came out, and my opinion hasn't changed.The only negative is that occassionally Linda's background singing is annoying. Other than that, it sounds very much like some of Paul's late 60's Beatle output."
4,"Creative, well-crafted body of work","Much like ""All Things Must Pass"" was a masterpiece for George Harrison after pent-up years as the third Beatle, Paul's ""RAM"" is an outpouring of his creative process at a time when we was peaking. Just short of a masterpiece, RAM encompasses several styles, multiple recording techniques and some downright excellent songwriting. I had forgotten about this album for several years and was pleased to find it again. A must for any Beatles or Mccartney fan. The remastered version sounds great - you can hear EVERYTHING."
5,Fun Album From Paul,"When I first got this album, I didn't know what to think. I particularily hated the song ""Monkberry Moon Delight"". I soon realized that the album is meant to be taken as fun and an enjoyable listen is guaranteed if this is utilized. Now, I love every song on the album and it puts me in a great mood every time I listen to it. The best songs, in my opinion are, Too Many People, Uncle Albert, Monkberry Moon Delight, and Backseat Of My Car. This album is one of those that if you don't like it at first, keep giving it a chance. It'll get too you and then you'll love it!"
4,Dear Boy,"""Ram"" is a curious one-off in McCartney's career, a solo effort unencumbered by a touring band that is also a big production. It is animated by a day-glo mixture of wild, eccentric humor and Beatles breakup anger. And it works. ""Too Many People"" is one of Paul's best postsixties recordings, ""Eat at Home"" ""Dear Boy"" and ""Heart of the Country"" boast catchy melodies, and ""Uncle Albert.."" is an irreverent pop symphony. One admires how true to his own pop leanings McCartney is here, not pandering to any critics and giving us this quirky stuff as is."
4,whatever he was shooting at he nearly hit the mark,"Although John Lennon seems to have garnered the most credit for being ""The experimental Beatle"" he never released anything as eccentric as this album. This is somewhat of an anomaly in the solo Beatles catalogue, consisting as it does of song fragments, spliced together pastiches and a multitude of ideas that never really make up a whole package...and yet, that is the charm of it all. Schizo that it is, it is still musical. ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" sums it up perfectly... Who knows what the hell it means but it sure is cool the way those different segments come in. Other cool tunes are ""3 Legs"" ( a kind of psychedelic blues pastiche), ""Too Many People"" (a big ""F...YOU"" to percieved political phonies) and ""Dear Boy"" (straight off the White Album). One great classic tune, sacrificed to terrible production values is the finale ""Back Seat Of My Car"". If only George Martin could have got his hands on this one..."
2,A few good songs and a bunch of.....,"Uncle Albert, which you can get on Wings Greatest, is perhaps the only salveable tune here...the rest has some interesting snatches of melody, which are easily forgotten....get it if you find it at a yard sale for a quarter...."
1,Not very good,"This is just not a very good album. Some of the songs have dumb lyrics, some have painfully awful musical moments, but it's all very slight and weak compared to the Beatles works from just a few years earlier. It's a dramatic dropoff in quality from Paul's songs on Abbey Road and Let It Be and the White Album, to this music. Compared to his songs on the Beatles albums, these songs sound like rejects. Some of the songs sound a lot like children's music. Paul is a likeable guy and you want to root for him, but honestly, when you listen to this music it just really isn't that good."
4,Paul at his rawest!,"""Ram"" (1971) was Pauls second solo album after the demise of the Beatles. It is raw in construction and recording quality but it is fresh in imagination. The album ""McCartney"" showed that he could go solo but this album really shows off his creativity and musical genious. The harmonies in ""Dear Boy"" are beautifully simple but engaging at the same time. This album was a declaration that there were good things to come and that Paul's career did not end with the Beatles."
5,IT'S RAM,"I have been playing this album,CD for forty years now. There are so many great songs here, Back Seat Of My Car, Ram, Too Many People, UA/AH, Long Haired Lady, I downloaded the songs, They do sound a little clearer in some parts. I hope I can play this record for Forty more years and Another Day. This reveiw is for the downloaded songs only. I haven't heard the LP to review."
5,I was surprised.,"I write from Sao Paulo in Brazil and I was surprised and very pleased with this product.As an admirer of the Beatles' work, in addition to CDs and DVDs, there are high-quality photos, copies of manuscripts of lyrics, photo albums, cards, booklets, etc.."
3,"""Ram On"" With McCartney's Second Album","After the mixed reception that greeted the charmingly homemade ""McCartney"" (1970), Sir Paul returned to the studio for this uneven album. Though ""Ram"" earned a bad rap from critics, it surpasses the appalling mediocrity of ""Wild Life"" and ""Red Rose Speedway."" There is one classic track (the elaborate ""Back Seat of My Car"") and tuneful ditties such as ""Ram On,"" ""Dear Boy"" and ""Heart of the Country."" McCartney's first solo hit, ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey,"" remains a catchy annoyance while ""Long Haired Lady"" is simply annoying. At least he still rocks on ""Smile Away,"" ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" and ""Too Many People"" - a John & Yoko critique that sparked Lennon's vicious ""How Do You Sleep?"" The strengths and weaknesses of McCartney are on full display in this 1971 release."
4,Definitely Under-Rated.....Some Of Paul's Best Work!,"Not only are there some catchy numbers on here, including the hit ""Uncle Albert"" but ""Too Many People"" and ""Dear Boy"" are Paul's subliminal cut-ups, which were directed at John Lennon.My personal favorite is ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" One of Mccartney's more obscure hits, which should have won the Frank Zappa award for creativity! I mean, wow!...it's litteraly a nonsense tune, full of strange lyrics. The whole album is worth buying JUST for Monkberry Moon....you'll tap your toe and scratch your head in confusion.I think Paul did a good job on this album!"
4,BETTER WITH THE YEARS,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable album which benefits from hindsight. We now know that the Beatles were an entity greater than the sum of its parts; something that should havebeen obvious. The fact that that ""Abbey Road,"" and ""Pepper""are clearly superior doesn't diminish ""Ram"" at all. Buy it and enjoy."
5,McCartney's best,"This album has it all. Beatlesque melodies, humorous lyrics, and perfect instrumentation. His songwriting is at it's best on RAM. Also Paul's vocals are in top condition. Linda's contributions are also perfect. To me, this album is the best post-Beatle album, and probably one of the best of the 70's!"
3,Sucking Monkberry Moon Delight,"People have always been happy to quote Lennon, about LET IT BE, saying he wanted the Beatles to be seen ""naked...warts and all."" But Lennon got Phil Spector to produce his early solo stuff, and while it's stripped down, it's produced to cover those warts. McCartney, who included a photo of himself with his finger up his nose in the gatefold of MCCARTNEY, shows a few warts on RAM, along with signs of the Pop masterworks he'd release later in the 1970s.Thing is, as the years wander off towards the horizon, I'm finding I like some of the wartier stuff the best. ""Uncle Albert?Admiral Halsey"" is interesting, and brings back memories of trying to figure out the lyric while lounging around the neighborhood pool, I like that gutter voice and snotty lyrics McCartney pulls out on ""Monkberry Moon Delight."" I've always liked the free-wheelin' goofy-ness of ""Eat At Home.""And ""The Back Seat Of My Car"" is one of the most underrated McCartney tunes of all time."
3,Decent,"I like this album because it's a little bit different than most of his others. There aren't really any heavy ballads. To me, it's one of his hardest rocking albums. I think the three best songs are Smile Away, Too Many People, and Eat At Home. I don't like Monkberry Moon Delight. A lot of the lyrics on the album make no sense, but the melodies are terrific.Overall, this is a good album, but there's too much Linda McCartney on it. Her harmonies, which I usually think are all right, are overkill on this album. If you're a Beatle fanatic you'll love the album, if you're only a casual fan, look at Band on the Run, Tug of War, or Flaming Pie instead."
4,~???~,"The critics didn't like this album?? I don't think he says the word ""love"" more than 5 times on the whole album,and they don't like it! So then he forms wings and writes a bunch of sugary songs about love, the critics love him and he's labeled by yuppies as a bubble gum songwriter.And the critics still don't get this album. Oh well, you can't please everyone. Now, I'm not saying that this album is a classic, it would have been better if he had anyone else produce this record and erased Linda's vocals. But songwise, with the exception of ""Smile Away"" and ""Long haired Lady"" this album comes closest to his ""Beatle"" sound than any other McCartney or Wings album ever made."
5,its good,"hey, this is a great album.... this ablum captures it all... (leave out lindas haaarmanys though) this one of his greatest works. band on the run is good, but this is a mantle peice!"
5,"Good Music, what more is there to say?","Forget all the semantic ravings, who cares if there's a message in the music, if you like it listen to it. That's the way I feel about this album. I wish I had found it before Band on the Run."
5,Fantastic Album,"I had this album on cassette, but wore it out years ago. I really enjoyed having a copy to put on my iPod, since I don't currently have a method to convert the vinyl copy I've got. There is a bonus in that this version has songs I hadn't heard before."
5,Best solo Beatle album bar none!,"Not only McCartney's best album but probably the best solo album by any ex-Beatle. To echo a previous poster's comment, this is a far superior piece of work to the 'Band On The Run'.This album has never been off my playlist since I bought it on the day of release in 1971. It has withstood the test of time and the vagaries of musical fashions and changing tastes.As much musical variety as any Beatles album with a breadth of melodic invention and more top class musical hooks than most artists manage in their entire career. Heck, the track 'Back seat of My Car' on its own contains more superb hooks than most performers manage in a career!Forty-odd minutes of musical genius that completely blows apart the myth that McCartney ""lost it"" after the break up of The Beatles."
3,save your money,"If you're trying to decide which edition of _Ram_ to buy, you are strongly advised to stick with the much cheaper domestic version. EMI's 1993 ""remastered"" editions of the McCartney catalog (with the white covers) have to rank as one of the greatest scams ever foisted on the unsuspecting public. Listening to these discs, it's painfully obvious that they didn't bother doing new transfers from the analog tapes, and just had somebody play with the eq a little bit. Don't believe me? Do your own comparison... you'll want your money back. Unfortuantely, unless you can track down DCC's gold discs, the only albums in the McCartney catalog that have been remastered in the true sense of the word are the 2-disc reissue of _Band on the Run_ and the _Wingspan_ anthology.Now, carping aside, this is a pretty groovy album. Has its ups and downs, like much of Mac's post-beatle work, but definitely worth a listen."
5,Paul's most fun album,"I think I said it all in the title - this is the most fun anyone would have listening to Paul Mc Cartney. Sure, All Things Must Pass was brilliant, and Plastic Ono Band and Imagine were very heartfelt, shoot-from-the-hip affairs - I have all three albums and love all three albums, but Ram makes me feel like I'm hanging out with a friend on a quiet afternoon, having a few beers, maybe doing a spliff."
3,not quite,"This record never quite comes off, though it has some fleeting appeal. There is a gorgeous melodic moment within ""Ram On""; there is the A section of ""Dear Boy"". ""Too Many People"" and ""Heart of the Country"" are fine but slight. ""Smile Away"" is idiotic.Recommended"" PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,Hardly by the horns - The Bonus Tracks version is the only decent version,"Paul & Linda McCartney / Ram (The Paul McCartney Collection - bonus tracks version): This is an mildly entertaining album with the hit ""Uncle Albert"", and the lesser radio songs, ""Too many people"" and ""Smile Away"". This album, in its original form barely gets out of a three star rating, however, this bonus track version adds the non-album hit ""Another Day"" as well as ""Oh Woman, Oh Why"". It is the bonus tracks that make this CD a true four star album. I wouldn't even bother with it without those two bonus tracks."
3,Not Beatles but good...,Paul did good on this. Band on the Run is better though It was a great start though. But Paul was better with the lads.
2,Not yet appalling Paul,"Though ""Ram"" is fundamentally flawed and ultimately unsatisfying I suppose it to be Paul McCartney's best record. I'm sorry to report that this is saying very little. I can remember how appalled we were when we heard the record that immediately succeeded ""Ram"" (I can't think of its name just now--one's mind has a way of protecting itself). In any case, if you've got all the Beatles records in your collection, and you absolutely need more Paul McCartney, I recommend you buy this. Just don't set your hopes too high."
2,"Honestly, this is not very good","I love McCartney and consider him to be a true musical genius and one of the towering figures in 20th and 21th century music, but despite his genius this material is mediocre at best. I was really looking forward to listening to this re-release, having never previously listened to the entire album/CD, but the experience was an extremely disappointing one for me. There are a few ""great"" songs, but overall the songs are bland, boring and trite. I can appreciate Paul's love for his wife, but Linda McCartney is a disaster, and should have been excised from this remaster."
5,Great Music!,"I wos 13 years old in 1971 when this ""8-Track"" first came out. I bought it just because of the picture and bought it for only $. I brought it home and plugged it into my $ Rhapsody 8-Track/AM radio combo and fell in love with it. I'm STILL playing the 8-Track even though the metal channel changer thingie is missing. It's time for me to get a CD and put the 8-Track to rest. This is the ONLY place I could find it. Thanks Amazon."
5,Criminally Underrated,"Ram is widely considered the best of paul McCartney's solo albums.This is correct, but it deserves higher praise than that. This is a record that predicted indie rock. It's psychedelic, experimental, and poppy to its core. It's for fans of lots of music, but I'd say anyone who likes The Flaming Lips or The Olivia Tremor Control should pick this up today."
4,"Nice Package, but...","This is a nice package, a little on the grand side for a fairly middling album. I could have lived without the little book of sheep. Sound on the CD's is nice, but if you've got 24bit capability, don't hesitate to download the hi-res files offered in the package."
5,Paul is my favorite Beatle,"This is my favorite album from Paul. I think it has a hint of the Beatles sound with progression and growth. Songs like Dear Boy and Uncle albert really show off Paul's versatility. I have to say, my favorite track is Heart of the Country. So soulful and catchy and has that good ol fashion folk sound that Paul is known for. Great album."
5,Help a young person discover this music!,"Living and working at a university, I'm finding a revival in interest among undergrads in the Beatles and their early solo projects such as Ram. Considering the rut that modern music finds itself in, that shouldn't be surprising. If you're around teens or young adults, do them a favor and put on Ram, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, etc. and see their ears perk up.Let's take a look at Ram. Not a bad track on the album. What makes it so different from today's scene? On one album, you have music that's , critical-but-not-whiny (Too Many People), bluesy (3 Legs), mystical (Ram On), harmonic (Dear Boy), distinctive (Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey), rocking (Smile Away), ditty-ish (Heart Of the Country), silly (Monkberry Moon Delight), lovey (Eat at Home), goofy-yet-sweet (Long Haired Lady), and melodic (The Back Seat Of My Car). You won't find a popular album today that even comes close to that diversity of styles. Ram on, dear boy."
5,Paul McCartney at his best,"This pre-Wings album is Paul McCartney's best material. Varied and eclectic, just when you have him pegged, the next song is different. This music shouts a message at us - that Paul McCartney has no loyalty to any particular genre of music."
5,Oh man... DON'T tell me you don't have this CD yet!,"I just got done looking at some pretty sad, one star reviews of Santana and I'm sad. I'm sure all the kids need this CD because Rob, Ms. Hill, Wyclef, Everlast, Dave and all the names they know are doing a song with ""this guy that plays awesome guitar!"" I've seen the other generations buying it because they need to hear Carlos and his guitar! For whatever reason you buy this CD, you will probably be surprised and yet oh-so happy for purchasing this! What more do you want? He won like a billion awards for this CD! So what are you waiting for, man?"
2,If only I had read your customer reviews 'fore I bought it.,Only Smooth is worth. I bought it only for it. Both those stars I have given it are for smooth alone.
2,Santana Disappoints,"I was looking forward to an alternative/rock album. Instead what I got was a latin/rap album with a couple of rock songs (which are the ones I had heard on the radio). A great tactical move by Santana, but a major disappointment for me!"
1,Great idea... Terrible product,"Carlos must be deaf to let this out. The sound is so compressed that it only sounds good on boom boxes and in cars. If you have a good quality sound system, you probably won't listen to this disk long."
3,One track wonder,"With the exception of ""Smooth"" I'd say this album lacks imagination and complexity. Guitar riffs on several tracks are virtually identical. I don't understand the hype and acclaim."
4,Sanatana is not dead,Santana has returned with an awesome CD that combines the old and the new and it rocks.
2,Supernatural,"Oh boy. Santana brings me back to being 15 and slow dancing at the Cove in Burien, WA during those awesome guitar riffs of ""Black Magic Woman"". But this album, except for a few songs, is enormously boring. I love Carlos and wanted to love the CD, but it just all sounds the same."
4,If you think this was good...,"...you should get some of Carlos' early work like Abraxas. This is a little softened up, but still pretty much pure Santana. At least the guitar work is pure. The real Santana had great drumming with those exotic pieces and it had the perfect voice for the band. Good as they are, everybody else is just the new guy.It's nice to see other people getting into this music after so many years. Santana was one of the essential ""Experience"" bands of the 60's for me along with the Doors, Janis, Jim and Jimi. One of the very few guitar gods to survive.I went to a Santana concert about 10 years ago and I got to see one of his concert/religious/almost sexual experiences. It was pretty cool the way some people would climb on stage just to touch the holy man's hand."
3,Santana better off on his own,"Why does this master need to bring in today's latest artists, most of whom may very well turn out to be no more than just fads? I say more of what he did on ""Lotus,"" long cohesive exciting solos much along the lines of what Coltrane did for the sax."
1,"Smooth Good, CD Bad","Once I heard Santana's new song with Rob Thomas (Smooth) I was very excited to see that Santana was back on the charts with a great song. I raced to the nearest CD store and bought ""Supernatural"" After I listened to ""Smooth"" I went through the rest of the CD and it was definately not the Santana of old, the guitar master of classic albums like ""Abraxis."" It was like listening to a combination of Tito Puente, Bob Marley, and Lauren Hill. Absolutely terrible stuff for any rock fans. My advice: buy the single."
1,DVD Audio Disaster,Although I generally like the music from this album - the DVD Audio is good example of how the record labels managed to kill this format. I bought this specifically for the higher quality STEREO ... but this disc is defaulted to 5.1 and it's extremely cumbersome and frustrating if all you want to do is listen to the album in higher res on your main stereo setup. 5.1 usually means home cinema (lower quality sound as it's also designed for movies) and in most cases awful 5.1 mixes of the original. If you like this album buy the CD and save yourself the grief.
4,Look at All Those Stars,Supernatural by Santna has a great variety of music. He has Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20 and a lot of other featured guests. Different guests for different tastes in music.
3,3.5 if i could,"The first pop release from the legendary santana. As always the guitar guru blows the mind with his skills. But this time around he brings some friends for the ride... Lauryn hill, everlast, dave matthews band, rob thomas etc. Some of the songs are pretty catchy and well produced such as ""maria maria"", and ""Turn the lights on"" with everlast. Personally im more a fan of his older releases, but respect the decision of progression. If your looking for a classic santana album this is not for you, if your just getting into santana then this is good to ease you in."
4,White Pop with Latin Overtones ...,"It is a good CD, -but can't stand the fact that Carlos is selling womens shoes and ties???? Now THAT is selling out, not because he has a pop CD. Get the picture ??? We knew you would !"
5,Great Latin rock/blues,"Carlos Santana is one of the great musicans of the current era. This album includes many guest artists and yet the constant through all the tracks is Carlos's playing. I love the first three Santana albums, but have not purchased anything since this album (apart from one disappointment). Carlos started playing the blues and this is evident in his music. This sound of this album is classic and is complemented by so many other good musicians. A bonus is 'The Calling' highlighting Eric Clapton. There is hardly a dud track."
4,"Very good, but not a classic.","Excellant music, great to listen to, but not quite a classic album. Get it if you enjoy Santana."
4,Great stuff!,"This album really rocks, and it was a great idea to combine Santana with younger players like Everlast and Dave Matthews. There are a lot of great guitar solos and a variety of different styles of music. While there is a lot of criticism in the customer reviews, I think that is mostly from people who hate it if their favorite artist becomes ""mainstream."" This is certainly not the best Santana album, but a good addition to the collection. The collaboration with Eric Clapton is really the only disappointment here -- very long and boring song. I would expect more from two of the best guitarists ever. However, Santana sounds as good as ever on many of the tunes, and you have to be deaf if you don't want to rock when you listen to the songs with Everlast, Dave Matthews and Rob Thomas. Enjoy!"
2,"Carlos made ""safe"" for lite-rock & lite-jazz radio","I can understand Santana's desire to reach a different, younger crown - but this? Any one cut on his 1st 3 albums (or the 80's ""Havana Moon"") kicks this whole album out to the curb. Carlos' trademark was complex rhythms and musicality - this sounds like music from ""Your Local Weather"" on the Weather Channel! On the positive side, maybe some folks will buy his older stuff again - but if you're expecting more of this ""music to pop Valium and drink herbal tea to"" you won't be happy."
4,Pretty good-The man's still got it.,"This is a good CD. Anyone out there who's always grooved to Santana will love it. Although I would've liked to hear more guitar, if you get it you'll deffinatly groove to it. It would've been worth it just for 'Smooth' and 'Turn Your Lights On'-let alone the whole CD."
5,"LO MAXIMO, LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR","ME ENCANTA, ES UNO DE MIS CANTANTES FAVORITOS, ME GUSTA SU ESTILO ES FASCINANTE, Y ADEMAS ME PARECE MUY GUAPO. ES MI IDOLO."
4,Great trakcs with Latino rythm and Alternative flair,"The new offering from Santana fits most listeners desires. There is rap, different styles of alternative, and even Eric Clapton. It has bridged a gap between different music genres that normally artists fail at. This CD is a good purcase for all types of people."
4,A fabulous album,"I bought the CD mainly for Smooth, but it turns out that there are a lot of great songs on it. Put Your Lights On was a great song, and really, the entire album was fantastic."
3,Could be better,I used to have that song Let the children play. That was a good song. I listened to it until the 45 broke one day. I wish Mr Santana would return to that type of music. I do so like watching what song comes next from him. I think he is ok.
1,Sucks,"Pure marketing, commercial trash, Santana has always being famous for doing covers and this is not the exception."
2,"Why, Mr. Santana . . . why!?","This album is just another great example of how pop and top 40 music is taking over the woorrllddd!! I'm fifteen years old and have liked Santana ever since my parents played it for me. So, when I heard all the talk about his new album and how great it was supposed to be, I thought to myself, 'Hey! Maybe I should go out and buy that!' So I did. Oh dear. I look at the track listing, and EIGHT of the thirteen songs are ""featuring"" another artist. Weeeee! It's too bad that those songs aren't any good. Most of the songs that have gotten air time on the radio sound NOTHING like Santana, and a lot like they should be on the featured artist's album. I give this album two stars for the songs that aren't featuring anyone, like Yaleo and Africa Bamba. If you want good music, get Abraxas or Santana or Moonflower. If you want stuff that sounds like everything else out there, get Supernatural!"
1,"Santana, I'm sadly surprised !",This was a true dissappointment ! There are a few good songs here and the rest is poor stuff. This is a collection of various music and I say that litely ! If you are looking for THE Santana music then this is not the album you want. If you want a sample of what a lot of groups are calling music today then this may be for you. The awards people are a bunch of know nothing of music anyway. Maybe this was for publicity !
2,lame songs and it's grammy time,"Santana motivated me to start playing guitar over 10 years ago when I saw him in concert. I bought handfulls of his releases around that time. He deserved his first grammys back in the 'black magic woman' days, but I doubt back then such music by a non-anglo would be allowed to champion the awards scene. I figure that's the only way you can explain it. How else do you explain how 'smooth' was such a hot hit? I cringed every time I came across that stupid song in my day to day life. Lots of canned music on this release and will not buy anymore Santana that are collaberations.I'll cut Santana slack if this is a case of needing to pay the bills, but other than that, Carlos, please leave the cheesy pop music for the Britanys, Matchboxes, and Backstreets of the world.Get back to Milagro, Dancing in the Flesh of Spirits, and Blues for ElSalvador. PLEASE!!"
1,The Good The Bad And The Ugly,"Man, talk about hitting rock bottom... What was he thinking, let's make a fast buck and sacrifice all artistic integrity? The album ranges from good to bad to just plain ugly, the good being Yaleo and El Farol - most reminiscent of classic Santana, the bad being Primavera and Love of My Life and the ugly being Put Your Lights On, Maria Maria, and just about everything else with rappers on it - I wonder what happened there, the band walked out on him? The poppy Smooth is soooo NOT Santana. The Calling is filler, so soporiphic that it will make you snore in the first 2 minutes, and there's like 8 of 'em. Does this stuff come from the same man who produced Abraxas, Caravanserai, Swing Of Delight, Santana III and Amigos? No way. I mean, all artists want to try new things from time to time, but it looks like here Mr. Santana forgot himself completely..."
3,If it's your sort-of thing,"This CD has lots of awesome artists other than Carlos in it and it is a kind of weird mixture with a litle of R&B, a little bit of rock, and A LOT of latin music. Carlos is awesome, though. Good CD for people who like a little bit of everything."
5,nonstop,"This CD is great. Every single song is great and relaxing and really connects the generations with new talents like rob thomas and Wyclef. I especially like ""maria maria"". This is an overall excellent cd and i definatley recommend it."
2,One good song...,"I thought that this album was really going to be good, Carlos has an excellent style and some great songs in his history. I found the album lacking a presence or feeling. I do like ""Smooth"", but without Rob Thomas, the song wouldn't be that great... I just thought the ablum was a letdown considering the potential."
5,Notice:,"If you like latin music, buy this album. From Smooth to Africa Bamba, this is a great all-around album. Buy it, ya won't regret it!P.S. If you don't like Smooth, you're not regular."
2,not bad but very commercial,"This album is very commercial. Santana has understood how to make money with songs that are devoted to the people fond of the music of MTV but not surely to the listeners of Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis or Tito Puente. If you wish to listen some real genuine latin music, buy the first album of Ibrahim Ferrer or the last of Compay Segundo. Luckily, in this album Santana shows that he has not forgotten how to play the guitar."
1,"Sorry to say, I really hated it","I bought this album because I love ""Smooth"" but the rest of the CD is absolutely nothing like it. There's not one other song on the CD that I like. It's a whole mix of latin-rap (who would have guessed those went together?), latin-rock, latin-traditional, and latin-who-knows-what. There's not one Santana style, it's more Carlos + the famous artist in some other category."
3,So Smooth...,"I bought the CD because I am a big Matchbox 20 fan and really liked ""Smooth"" (with Rob Thomas) when I heard it on the radio. Rob Thomas steals this CD and shows that he has the versatility to synergize with Carlos Santana's masterful, soulful, guitar. This is about it, though. Eric Clapton, Dave Mathews, and the various hip-hop artists efforts disappoint."
4,"GREAT CD! just a bit too long, though","Santana's smash hit release ""Supernatural"" is flying off shelves everywhere! It's the best CD from a solo artist I've ever listened too. Problem is, it's too long. No foul language, and great solos."
2,"Yeah, I'm hard...","..in my rateing now, but that doesn't mean I'm not into new-thinking! I like Santana in every way, and I'm not into being boring stubbern refusing-to-play-new-stuff-of-old-masters... I just HONESTLY like their old stuff better. But hey! Go ahead and get this CD, offcourse, it's Santana, so it is worth the money!!!"
5,Mindblowing,"I had never bought any of Santana's stuff until a friend suggested it to me, and only because of him featuring Laurin Hill. I bought the CD and liked EVERY OTHER song more than the track with Lauren Hill. He has a track for everyone. It is a definate ""Must Buy""."
4,Poetic justice.,"How great to see Carlos Santana back on the charts and in everybody's attention!In the late eighties and early nineties he was reduced to the status of oldies but goldies.'Supernatural'ends all that,almost like a...divine intervention needed to rescue good music from the nineties' muck.There are some star guests here,but Santana had the decency of allowing them some imput allowing for a very thorough and powerful musical experience,not only true to the Santana sound,but also very contemporary.Muy bonito!"
3,Where is carlos?,"CAARLOOS? CAARLOOS? Where is Carlos Santana? Supernatural is not Carlos Santana. This album is one of the best albums for this time, but is not the Santana real music. This music don't have the soul, the heart, of the latina music. Alberto"
1,Superficial and depressing,"His guitar still sounds like no one else. But the rest of this travesty of a CD with its Vegas-styled Latin rhythms and slicker than slick production, plus those desperate collaborations make Santana sound as compelling as Hootie and the Blowfish. This is what the Beach Boys' ""Kokomo"" was to ""Good Vibrations"" or Grace Slick singing ""White Rabbit"" versus ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now."" I'm happy for Carlos Santana's success, but did it have to happen with such an innocuous and calculated group of songs? A corporate record and totally dispensable. Many Grammy's are sure to follow."
4,Some Old Guys Still Have It,I've seen Santana live a few times over the past two years and Supernatural makes me feel the way seeing him makes me feel. The energy is there and I can feel it even in a rainy seattle winter day.
4,"Good CD, excellent concert","Featuring songs with many new artists, Santana has delivered a great album that is sure to be a top seller. If you think the album is good, check out the concert. Santana is on tour!"
5,Simply brilliant.,"Don't listen to the other reviewers.I've always liked Santana, I own his previous 'Best of' collection, but I wouldn't have blinked if the had simply labeled this album 'The Best of Santana', it is that good.Santana's trademark wailing guitars come through in every track, even in tracks that aren't obviously trademark Santana, such as the tracks featuring Everlast and Lauryn Hill, the latin flavour comes through and combines with each artist's unique talents to create gems of collaborations.Every single track in this album is brilliant, from the catchy spanish 'Primavera' (my fav), to the epic jam session with the two guitar legends, Clapton and Santana, in track 13, 'The Calling'.All in all, this is one of the rare albums that actually worth the ridiculous price they charge for CDs, buy it, love it, cherish it."
4,"Great cd , BUT ...","This is a solid work . However , you must approach it with an open mind . If you are not into Latin sounds ( and I mean REAL Latin sounds , not ordinary prepackaged pop with horns , timbales and a couple of phrases in Spanish a la Ricky Martin , etc . ) you may find many of these songs difficult to handle at first , in spite of the Eric Claptons , the Dave Matthews and others . Even if you are not an eclectic , give this one a chance . It may help you begin to expand your musical taste and discover a very rich and exciting musical genre."
1,Are zero stars not possible?,"I had eagerly anticipated the release of this. Initially, I did not get to hear it, and was even more excited after the hype. By recruiting artists from a variety of sub-genres to work with a man w/ great name recognition, Sr. Santana and the label tried to and succeeded in selling a zillion albums. Great marketing ploy. Bad music ploy. Well, it goes to show that hype doesn't mean a hill of beans. This CD was extremely disappointing. After all, Eric Krapton's (no coincidence that this washed-up Anglo retread guitarist helped Carlos with a track) ""If I See You In Heaven"" also received hype and awards, and it was a terrible CD. Eric Krapton should have hung up his guitar in the early 70s. At least Carlos has still got the skills. He needs to get Greg Rollie and a tight band back, and produce more consistent music."
2,Worth a listen,"I listened to my wife's CD to see what this was all about. Interesting arrangement of guests, but I will probably never voluntarily listen to this again. Lots of interesting beats. Lots of notes. That's about it. I was not stirred."
2,warning! warning!,"If you are considering buying this CD, then please, save your money. I have to say that this is the worst CD I have ever bought. I got it because I love the single, ""Smooth"" and thought that the rest of the songs would be of simalar quality. If you want to know the truth, most of it just sounded like elevator music to me. I gave it to my mother, who usually likes that kind of ""easy listening"" music, but she listened to it once through and had pretty much the same opinion as I did. Some people may like the kind of music that is on here, but if you are expecting the rest of the songs on here to sound like ""Smooth"", then you will be terribly dissapointed."
1,We waited years for this crap?,"When I heard that there was to be a new Santana album, its release was eagerly anticipated. Then I bought it. What a piece of crap! It was so disappointing that I thought about rolling down my window and throwing it over the side of a local bridge crossing the Hudson River as I drove over it. Then I realized the state of the river and decided that it did not need any more pollution. Now in hindsight I suppose if I had thrown it out they would want to dredge the river or something. When I saw Santana about 5 years ago I was supremely disappointed. Not just at the music and performance, but over the fact that I had no substances to abuse with me to ease my discomfort. Oh well! (p.s. I gave the damn thing away to a 12 year old girl)"
4,bravo!,"i bought the cd because of the single ""smooth"", but the rest of the album did not dissappoint. the tracks not featuring guest vocalists are santana at his best - smooth, soulful and sufficiently modern. guest performers put their own stamp on the tracks (sometimes too much so, making you forget whose album it is), but the songs featuring the dave mathews band, everlast, and rob thomas are terrific!"
5,"Simply, Carlos Santana at his best!!","Santana, with a little help from his friends make this one of his best performances, yet! Great selection of musicians for this CD, by far has to be the finest work of the year. Good on you Carlos, keep the music coming."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I was expecting more from santana because the songs ""Maria Maria"" And offcorse ""Smooth"" But the other songs are boring and have not life at all. They have none if singing in it then thre is hardley any."
3,Will The Real Santana Please Stand Up?,"Carlos Santana has been around as long as I can remember and I'd never cared for his music. Then he wins every award for SUPERNATURAL? I think it should be viewed as a possible ""give it to the older guy"" award. And the Rob Thomas song did not get my attention as others when the Grammy's were handed out. Santana is back. How long will it last? So many artists. Most of them better than this joint effort including Rob Thomas."
2,What happened here,"I've been a major Santana fan since the begining of his career. Rock, jazz, freeform, Latin..they all sounded great but this album's hip hop is too far for me. I don't know if the effort is commercial or just trendy but there's no room on my shelf to add this one."
2,Mediocre at best,"I was disappointed with this CD after all the hype. How can one go from being one of the premier guitar legends of this century in 1969 to recording music thirty years later with an ""artist"" who calls himself ""Eagle-Eyed Cherry?"" It's time to grow up, Mr. Santana."
1,Gift,"Bought it as a gift. I LOVE Santana, and Carlos was brilliant to merge himself with todays top artists, BUT, I think todays artists suck, and so the album isnt good. However Santana made a great career move on this"
1,Pop goes Santana,"Pull out/borrow/buy a copy of Santana`s 1972 masterpiece ""Caravanserai"", pay close attention to the track titled ""Song Of The Wind"", and then compare it with the absolute DRECK on this 'popsy'-nonsense, and then ask yourself whether this is even the same guitarist. I recommend the old stuff-- before Carlos felt the need to become a mainstream pop star, for some reason."
2,Not what it should be...,"Call me a naysayer, pessimist, what you will, but I really have to agree with fellow ""party poopers"" who ""just like to ruin a good thing,"" or so they say, that Carlos has sold his soul to mainstream pop. Upon first hearing that Santana was signing onto pop label Arista, my immediate first response was ""Uh, Oh."" And having pop producer Clive Davis on board didn't help things much, either. Don't get me wrong, this album has it's moments (such as his collabrations with Eric Clapton and the Dave Matthews Band), but for the most part, I would much rather remember Santana for ""Black Magic Woman"" rather than for ""Smooth."" It's okay, but the money's better well spent on Santana's first three albums."
2,i only like one song out of here,"you know, i bought this disk on the strength of Smooth, the AWESOME cha-cha song! but as i listened to the rest, i just wasnt attracted to all the other songs. so i sold the CD. oh well."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"This album is Carlos Santana at his finest. Every song is so beautiful, it's hard to pick a favorite. The other artists on the album are incredibly talented and add so much to Carlos Santana's outstanding talent."
5,Santana: The definitive master.,"A must buy. Cosmopolitan, psychedelic, cross-cultural. Appeals to all musical tastes. Pretty damn fantastic work for an old guy. Carlos Santana is more in tune with the music scene than anyone."
3,"A Good Comeback, But Not Great","SUPERNATURAL is a good comeback for Santana, but unfortunately, the appearance of numerous featured guests, plus a lack of consistently strong material, prevents this album from being an example of Santana at his best. Even his 80s albums had a voice consistent throughout each album, which this one lacks. The important Santana discs are the first three albums, ESSENTIAL SANTANA, the two BEST OFs, GREATEST HITS, or even CARAVANSERAI, WELCOME, LOTUS, BORBOLETTA, AMIGOS, MOONFLOWER, FESTIVAL, INNER SECRETS, MARATHON, or ZEBOP! If you're satisfied with a Top 40-oriented sound and style, however, SUPERNATURAL is a great choice."
3,Pedestrian pop,"I still long for the days of the 70s, when this fine Mexican guitarist shined with brilliance. This album may have been a huge commercial success, but not one song on it is interesting to me. Dave Matthews and Eric Clapton and many other guests, it does not matter. Just pop and plainness with limited and so-so soloing, a pale shadow of Carlos's best moments."
3,Gets Tired,"I like only two songs from this CD, Smooth and Love of my Life, and I want to get rid of it, but I still want these two songs. When I first got it, I was into it, but the excitement soon faded and I haven't listened to it in a year. Don't buy into the hype."
5,"excellent songs, excellent album, excellent band",Santana is nothing new. The incredible guitar skills of Carlos have been amazing people for many years past. But what Santana did in this album was a unique and brilliant formula for success. He took his talent and used it to promote the talents of today's famous musicians.Of course when you mix Santana with the sounds of Matchbox 20 or Everlast... you get an interesting combination... a SUCCESSFUL combination.I've given products 5*'s before... but never have I meant it like I mean it here.... ORDER NOW!
3,I think you have to be a Santana Fan to like it.,"All the reviewers who wrote the positive reviews I read seem to be long time fans. I'm not, which may explain why I didn't like this album very much. I respect Santana as a guitar player, but the only song I liked was Smooth. Even if you are a long time fan, you may not like the album right away. My aunt who likes Santana said she had to listen to the whole album a few times before she liked it. I don't care enough to force myself to do that. If you have only heard Smooth or Maria, Maria on the radio and none of Santana's other work, I would first listen to the samples or see if a friend has it before buying it."
3,Another point of view,"Enough has been said about the music on this CD. If you plan to listen to Supernatural on good audio equipment, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. The musical sound spectrum compressed. This is not problem if you're listening in your car or on so-so audio equipment, but on a good audio system it will take only about 15 seconds of listening and you'll realize the highs and lows are clipped."
1,not for everyone,"First of all, its old school. If you dont like this kind of music in the first place, this CD wont make you like it. The songs are nothing to get excited about or anything. If you are fan of Santana and his style of music, go get it because it sounds just like it did back 30 yrs ago. But if you're not a die-hard fan, save your money, i cant imagine how it possible got the best album award last year, its not good, its boring. Simple as that."
1,The Worst CD Ever!!,It's the worst CD on earth!! please don't buy this!! It will be a BIG BIG MISTAKE!!!
1,Is this CD for kids?,"Okay, my dad was all""Go listen to Santana!"" so I did. I mean,WOW!What is this stuff? Is there such thing as 0 stars? Sorry if you like it, but to me it sounds like a bunch of old guys strummin' on guitars. I AM NOT A HYPOCRITE!"
1,MY CAT SING'S BETTER,MY CAT SING'S BETTER. I DONT KNOW HOW THIS JABRONI THINK'SHE'S WORTHY TO EVEN SING. WHEN DOES PEOPLE REALY KNOW ENOUGHIS ENOUGH ALREADY. I TRULY AMAMAZED THEY LET GARBAGE SING.
4,A sleeper - for me.,"I've been a Santana fan since the Woodstock album and Evil Ways. I didn't like this too much at first. But just lately, I've taken a real shine to it. It's not often that Santana's music has had to grow on me but that's the case here. Even Santana's guitar playing sounds better the more I listen to it.I was just content before to be happy that Santana has found big-time success again - even if I wasn't happy with this CD. Now I'm happy for me too."
2,make up please!,"I have heard this cd and it is a bust.To me, it's like an old lady going in for a facelift and having everyone tell her how great she looks.Santana's music now, reminds of Miles Davis when he came back from retirement to make meaningless blather, with young musicians that don't know any better.If you don't believe me,go listen to Caravanserai, if you have the nerve"
3,How nice! Just in time for the gift giving season!,"...And yet, the question remains... Is Carlos trying to regain some of his former celebrity status, or are the semi-literate newbies on the album trying to legitimize their efforts by cashing in on a legend?... Some of the tracks are good, bordering on great. Some are mutilated by wanna-be hacks. Still, all in all, it's worth adding to your Santana ""I'd-rather-be-drinking-tequila-on-a-hot-afternoon-in-Juarez"" collection."
2,IGNORE THE HYPE - HIS AGE SHOWS,"There is far too much praise for Santana's album. After his first release, Smooth, I loved him too, but ever since he has failed to deliver. Why you may ask. It's because of his duo partners. Rob Thomas consistently ranks amongst the top of the charts with Matchbox 20. Pairing with Everlast and Eagle-eye Cherry has seen his releases not make it back into the Australian top 20, and this is the same place where those artists have generally been found. I was very disappointed with the rest of the album, and the second star only comes because of how good Smooth is."
3,Santana 'Hits' again (maybe)!,"Well, I'm a great fan of Santana, both for his talent as a musican, and also for his music in general. However, I was quite let down by this album, firstly because it is more like a compilation of various artists (great way how to sell a CD), and secondly for verging on to the commercial side, more than sticking to his own style. Don't get me wrong, from the first few notes of every track one can immedatley notice that it is Santana song, but the songs except for a very few (eg. the 1 with Clapton), are all rather contemoporay. Well I hope it's a one off album, and in the future we will get more 'old' Santana albums. On the positive side it is great to listen to whilst driving or at a party, I'd describe it as an easy going album."
5,Sure to be a classic. All rock-n-roll fans should own it.,This album is a great mix of the Latin sound with some great Santana Sounds. The way Carlos has brought some of todays hot rockers is something special.
4,Supernaturally right on time,"A little something for everyone. It was a nice balance of Carlos and his guest artists. The Lauryn Hill track is one that radio slept on, but is a tight track. I also like ""Maria, Maria"" despite the fact that radio tried to play the hell out it."
4,I liked it -from a non-fan,I'm not a big fan but I really did enjoy this album. For me it's got some really well put-together tunes and was a great stress-reliever to listen to. Good car driving tunes too.
4,Popular yes! (But not up to par.),"While this may be his most commercially successful release in years, it is at the same time disapointing! Carlos Santana has long been one of the most prolific guitarists in Rock. Supernatural is a compromise in musical content, that was created to sell. I do like two or three of the collaberations with the guests he has chosen to work with. Put your lights on, and Smooth are good songs. Several times in this release the ""guest"" artist mentions Santana in the lyrics of the song. That just comes across as tacky. As a person who owns almost everything that Santana has produced I still recommend Supernatural, just don't expect another ""Abraxas"" or ""Moonflower""."
3,Santana's Back,"Don't decide at first listening. Let this CD grow on you. The horns, the vocals, the unparalleled guitar of C.Santana. Very good listening, and somewhat of a flashback to his performances in the wild '80s."
5,Red Hot Smokin Liquid Soul Music with extra spice.,"Many songs are classics from the first note. It's as fresh as you can get and yet It's STILL Santana after all these years. Remember Woodstock? Thank God for keeping Carlos with us all these years. This is one of THE BEST ""albums"" produced in the past twenty years. Thank you Santana, you have given us more music to hear."
4,"Excellent CD, highly recommended","This CD provides a wonderful variety of styles. I prefer his instrumental works, but the collaberations are a nice addition. Carlos Santana has always been an extremely talented musician, and this CD reflects that his talent still lives on..."
4,What's not to like?,"As a big music fan, I need to let everyone out there know that this is a great CD that pretty much anyone will love. There is something for everyone! Perfect gift for Christmas or birthdays. I give this CD 4 stars, a very nice job, but not among my favorites."
4,"Good but ""guitar shop"" playing irritating","Well I do like this CD because of some strong songs, but Santana has always come across to me like a teenager who has learnt a few riffs and can't stop playing them loud and fast. There's no invention or feeling in his playing. He'll always be second tier to players like Hendrix, Clapton, Van Halen. Several of the tracks sound like he over-dubbed the guitar leads, long after the main song was finished, so they seem redundant. But enjoyable nonetheless."
2,Makes profit outta other artist's singing talents,"Santana seems to make money from the sales all because of his featured guest's singing talents. All he seems to do is just play the electric guitar while ruining the song when there's no vox.Even though the songs are good due to other artists, don't waste your money on this album and put more change in his pocket."
2,"Santana ""Supernatural""",Very disappointing! An artist of Carlos Santana's caliber does not need mediocre guest stars to make a satisfying album. The only tracks that work are the ones that he is able to stretch out and play his urgent guitar solos. Consider this a sellout for the youth market.
2,Not up to snuff,"Very briefly...for me, this album just did not measure up to the early Santana albums. All of those great, dark Latin rhythms and energies just don't show up in this collection of pop tunes."
1,Supernatural,"Highly overrated. The only song worth listening to is ""Smooth"". After all the hype, and all the Grammy awards it won, I was expecting much more. It was a real letdown."
4,Today's Santana,"I am not a big fan of Santana. In fact, this is the first Santana CD I own. But this is a great one.Who are we to demand Santana to continue to be the one who pleased us in the 1970s? Supernatural represents today's Santana. And we should judge on its merits alone, instead of comparing today's Santana with Santana a quarter of a century ago.Supernatural is a great CD. And the man behind it is (Carlos) Santana."
1,Shameful Sell-Out,"For an artist whose career has been characterized, in my view, by a consistent dedication to the quality of his music, this piece of drek is a huge disappointment.The Amazon reviewer got it right...this cd is a blatant attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator. And in the current abysmal musical climate, the results are predictably bland and uninspired. The best song on the cd is the utterly mediocre duet with Rob Thomas, and it goes downhill fast after that. No wonder it was so sucessful at Grammy time."
4,Carlos Santana Rocks on the guitar.,"My first Santana CD. The song with Dave Matthews is great, as well as the other artists that work with Santana. A great CD to pick up up if you love good music."
5,An Amazing Mix of the Americas-North and South!,"I think that this record displays a perfect mix of Santana's Hispanic roots and our American culture. Featuring artists such as Rob Thomas, Everlast, Dave Matthews, and Lauryn Hill, this album has a song for everyone.Africa Mamba,El Farol, Primavera, Love of My Life, and Put Your Lights On are all amazingly peaceful and calming while Corazon Espinado, (De La) Yaleo, The Calling, Wishing it Was, Do You Like the Way, Maria Maria, Migra, and Smooth are all good dance songs."
5,Unbelievable,"I was only vaguely interested in this album until I heard about the great artists that would be featured on it. I just had to check it out. Verdict: unbelievable! This is a musical event. When Lauryn talked about music being able to inspire and lift us higher, this is a prime example of what she meant. I've been musically enlightened by this album and I will surely be checking out Santana's other musical creations."
2,Who is kidding who with this record?,"What's next? Leslie West featuring Eminem? Like a prior reviewer, I purchased this on a recommendation. Is there a lesson here?And yes, he still plays beautifully so calling this a waste of time is a bit of a stretch. But only a bit."
3,"A good listen, if unspectacular","Carlos Santana is one of the greatest living musicians, but it's been more than 20 years since he recorded an album that was as vital or creative as the early work he's best known for. While this new record is not exactly a return to his younger form, it's miles ahead of some of the lackluster efforts we've seen in the 80s and 90s. Now that Santana has become an ""elder statesman"" it seems appropriate that he collaborate with younger artists to reintroduce his sound to a new generation. The result is uneven --- you couldn't expect any different with all the different performers involved --- but it offers a synthesis of old and new that is very appealing, much in the same way the John Lee Hooker's ""The Healer"" used guest stars (most notably Santana!) 10 years ago to give the blues legend a commercial and critical success. This is easily Santana's best album since ""Shango"", or for that matter, ""Moonflower""."
5,You're missing out on great music if you pass up this album!,"I have always had great respect for the talents and genius of Santana, though I have never been a big fan, nor have I ever purchased any of his music until now. When I heard ""Smooth"" on the radio I instantly loved it and knew I had to have this album. The collaborations with Rob Thomas (whom in my opinion is an excellent songwriter), Everlast, Lauren Hill, and Dave Mathews are outstanding (and Clapton). This album introduces a whole new audience to Santana. His talent istireless and his music seems to be consistently enthralling. He is one of those artists, who you don't need to be a fan, nor know the names of his songs to know his sound, if that makes sense. Buy this album! You wont regret it."
4,This is Supernatural!,"I grew up listening to my brothers Santana's vinyl records. Now I own my very first Santana CD. This is a must have, you won't stop dancing."
2,too-commercial,"carlos is better than this.his talent far outlast the flavor of the day the record company essembled for him.rob thomas,everlast,dave matthews are all wack.lauyrn hill and wycliff just gave him the same song.eagle eye didn't bring nothing new to the table.check out the santana brothers and live at the fillmore for the real and his early 70's releases."
1,The music sounds like it is described!,Igive credit to the artists for their dedicated effort but Iwould not purchase the CD.I dont hear anything extremely exciting& it doesnt make me feel musically motivated!. I prefer the old Santana music!.
1,disapointing,"I'm sorry to say and sad to report that I really can't stand this cd. I don't like any of the ""guests"" with the exception of E.C. of corse but even that track was nothing special.the other tracks of traditional santana songs lacked the ""fire"" that carlos is know for and it all sounds to much like his old stuff. after who knows how many ""best of"" realeases i was looking forward to a new cd but it's pretty much the same thing just under a different name.i'm sure aristia wanted to boost his sales with all the named guests but for me i'll take the old santana anyday of the week."
1,This is pop-trash. Buy the old stuff.,"This album finds a once great guitarist trying to find an audience with the wrong people. He wrongly aimed for the pop-trash, MTV, radio-play bulls**t. I believe that he may still be a great guitarist and might be able play excellent music, but this CD doesn't support that. If you want hardcore Santana: Santana 1, Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanserai, and Love Devotion Surrender (with virtuoso John McClaughlin) are highly recommended. But those who disagree with me can keep jerking-off to their Britney Spears s**t and never know what great music is."
1,bad audio to much rap,for a new disc the audio has little dynamicrange and freq.range limited.did not understsnd why rap was on this disc?i have 2 early santana disc that soundsmuch better
2,S-E-L-L-O-U-T,"After many years of making some great music, but never getting recognition from anyone but his loyal fans (I guess that wasn't enough), Carlos Santana sells out with this album that is full of alternative singers from other bands. Although Santana still has some magic in his guitar, it seems as if he only cared about the fame and money in this poor excuse for a cd. This should be filed under s, not for Santana but for Sellout."
5,Awesome: Ricki can take a flying leap,"I love the older Santana, but I really think that this CD has hit it for the 90's sound. It has some of the hottest artists co-starring with him, and the sound is fantaz!"
5,Please somebody tell me I'm not the only one...,"that sees some (strong) resemblance between ""Love of my life"" and the third movement of Brahms most famous Symphony (sorry, I can't recall the number). I'm a Santana's fan since I was a teenager and Abraxas was one of my favourites ever. I love this cd, it's wonderful, and of course being a Dave Mathews fan it's a real nice surprise to listen to them together. Don't miss it, it's great!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I just bought it, and as soon as i put it in, i thought it was great! The first song's a little stupid, but all the others are really cool! If you like Latin or just spectacular guitar, than this Santana album is the way to go."
5,This Album is wonderful,I've listened to this CD about 50 times since I got it a few days ago. If you like Carlos you will love this.
5,that guy was wrong,"The guy who wrote the review of this album for amazon.com was way off about the collaborations. Maybe they are just ways to attract younger listeners, but it works so well that both young and old Santana listeners can enjoy them."
3,too commercial,"I remember they said ""Spirits"" wasn't commercial enough; I guess this one is. Though the rest of Santana's albums more than make up for one off one."
5,This cd is the bomb,"This is the best cd I have heard this year. The song smooth is just the bomb, man can santana make that guitar sound smooth. And the song with Mana is also thy bomb. I tell you all, that if you listen to this cd its going to be hard to take your hands of it."
4,Very Smooth,Santana has finally gotten the recognition he so richly deserves.For a long time people thought that the modern guitar licks made popular by contemporary bands were original.Everyone...meet the Master.Love of My Life is just a small indication of the feeling that flows through Carlos Santana's soul.
4,classic santana,"i think this cd is great,it brings out the old santana that i grew up listening to and it mixes with the music of today.smoothe is the best track on this cd,way to go carlos.keep making that guitar sing like always have.and keep trying this new thing ,its working out great,i love it as well as everyone else."
5,Lauryn Hill and Cee-Lo ?,"I've been a Santana fan for a long time and love MOST of the new CD but why oh why was Carlos moved to include Lauryn Hill and Cee-Lo on this hot disk? Lauryn Hill ! I'll spare everyone my TRUE feelings about Hill, Cee-Lo and the rest of the inhabitants of that genre...booooooo! Anyway - great job Carlos - my Fender Mexican thanks you also!"
3,Over rated and hyped,"After hearing this all I have to say is why Carlos why.Most of the people on the album such as Rob Thomas Dave Matthews and Eagle Eye Cherry really suck.There are some bright spots like the song with Mana and maria maria,although why was Wyclefs background commentary in that.Him saying westcoast eastcoast sorta cheapened the song"
4,A GRAMMY LONG OVERDUE,"This is indeed a fine mixture of Carlos' passionate instrumental gifts and collaberation with various modern artists. There's something for everyone on ""Supernatural"". The instrumentals will knock your socks off (check out the dual guitar interplay with Mr. Clapton on ""the Calling""). The collaberation with Rob Thomas on ""Smooth"" is the album's best vocal cut. Carlos, your Grammy was long overdue, amigo, and this fine album proves it without a doubt."
5,Don't be afraid of change.,"Don't be upset that Santana changed his style: it's actually not that drastic of a change in my opinion. If Jimmi Hendrix were still around, he would indubitably have changed his style a bit to accomodate the younger crowds. Carlos plays the guitar excellently, and he still makes you feel something. Most artists could not still do that kind of work from the 60's to the year 2000."
4,Superb,"Carlos Santana is one of the few classic rock stars still performing (right up there with Eric Clapton and Bruce Springsteen) who can still amaze and dazzle with one stroke of the guitar. His tracks on Supernatural are full of rich latin beats and mixed with some of today's best new voices and talents. Santana combines moody feeling in every tune, and of course the Number One smash hit Smooth is contagious! Get ready to rack up the Grammy Awards this year, Carlos! This CD is a keeper!"
5,Santana's comeback album debut!,"Santana makes history again with the album on CD ""Supernatural"" from 1999 also grammy award winner as well of that same year. The songs are wonderfully performed by different artists with Carlos after a long absence from the spotlight for a while. Ever since the bands remergence from the early prime mid psychedelic sixties era. Carlos has had his own ups & downs he suffered problems with drugs for years. Now he's back on top in the musicworld remerging Himself to a full happy life again. The guests include are Rob Thomas (Matchbox 20), Lauren Hill, Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews. A masterpiece genius Carlos has done here. Simply the best music ever listened too let's hope Santana makes another album soon. Simply the best music ever listened too it's awesome and excellent!"
3,Santana with an added plus,"I'll admit that this album has been over-hyped since I originally purchased it way back when it was first released. To boot, ""Smooth"" has been worn dead on the radio. However, there are a lot of hidden surprises far beyond ""Smooth"". If you are a fan of Santana, and are open to an album with multiple 'guests', this is a great diverse album. I contest Tamarak's opinion on ""Eagle Eye Cherry"", which would be his birth name. The son of Jazz musician Don Cherry, and brother of Nina Cherry. For those not familiar with Eagle Eye's album ""Desireless"", I would highly recommend it! I admit I originally bought this Santana album, with the expectation that Dave Matthews was part of more than one song, it has been an enjoyable album, although not worthy in my book of multiple Grammy Awards! Had it not won all those awards, I might have rated this a 4-star album. This album goes above and beyond ""Smooth"", although not all 'guests' may be to everyone's fancy..."
3,good,"this album would have been much better had it not been for eagle eye cherry, lauryn hill, wyclef john, and everlast ruining about half of the album. carlos is a great guitarist, so why in the hell is he playing hip-hop? dave matthews comes in for a great performance on ""love of my life"". although i think it has been played to death on the radio, ""smooth"", was actually a good song at one time. all in all, not a must have, but a fair album."
4,Tasteful rhythm and soloing,"Santana provides some good latin rhythms and great guitar solos in this album. The quality of the music is certainly high which provides Santana a good way of channeling his energy. Also, the vocals and guitar playing provide a good mix."
3,"Like the Smooth, but everything else?","I liked Smooth, but some of the other songs were just this side of slightly weird. Carlos Santana is great...I'm not sure of some of the other collaborators he worked with on the other songs were as talented. Some of the songs weren't a blend so much as an experiment and a little rough. Unless you're in love with Santana and can overlook some of the rough spots, or have so many other cds that you just want to experiment, this one may not be for you."
4,proves great music does span generations,"When my sixteen year old son requested this for Christmas my response was...""Santana?"" Of course he thought he had discovered a new artist. We now own this on both cd and cassette so that we can listen to it anywhere. It is a favorite for both the teenagers and the mom in our household!"
4,Santana is Cool,"Some of the populat songs played on the radio are very prominant in this cd. Santana makes me want to shake my booty. This CD is really great for a workout session. Try to imagine yourself as a person competing in a dance competition. Now shake it until it hurts, and let Santana'sfingers suduce you."
3,CD PLAYED FINE,"CD PLAYED WITHOUT ISSUE, PACKAGE CAME DISTROYED, LOOSE IN A BOX THAT WAS TOO LARGE AND NOT ENOUGH PACKAGING TO PREVENT IT FROM DAMAGE"
2,Dont buy this.,"Sad. Very Sad. Its not that this is the worst album ever made, but that there are so many people buying this album. 7.4 million coPIES! I have lost all faith in the buying public. Maybe 2 mil, but not 7 mil. Please. If you want quality, yet emotional and genious music, then I highly recommend the new Smashing Pumpkins album, Machina the Machines of God. EVery song on this album is much MUCH better than Smooth or Maria,Maria. Just trust me on this one, you WONT be dissapointed. Thanks."
1,more like ZERO STARS,"this is the worst album i've EVER heard... i have to listen to the monotonous 'smooth' at my work every 2 hours(no joke). i am sick of it and santana has no talent. i wish he would stop making albums soon....and he didn't deserve any of the grammy awards he ""won"". the only reason he received the awards is because he is an old, washed up musician and people feel sorry for him. he needs to take lessons from brittany spears! she knows how to rock!"
2,YUCK!,"Okay,this CD has been number one long enough. I'd hate to say it,but this CD stinks. Santana gets all the credit when it's Rob Thomas,Lauryn Hill,etc. that deserve it. He's needs to give it UP! There are a lot more derserving artists that have more talent that need to be number one. I mean,I like Smooth as much as the next guy,but it's getting old!"
1,Supernatural Roadkill,I bought this CD based on the hype it received for winning the Grammy. It's now roadkill on the side of a Georgia interstate. This was one of the worst albums I've ever heard.
2,Over Rated!,"Love of my Life, Smooth and the other songs you hear on the radio everyday are as good as ever. It is the rest of the CD that I found extremely disappointing. Kind of like when you see the previews for a new comedy movie and the only good parts are the previews!"
1,don't buy it!,this album is so bad! i can't believe this guy gets all this credit! he only plays the gutair! come on people! buy anything but this album!
4,Good album that allows Santana to expand his artistry.,"Reading all of the various reviews I get the feeling that most people feel that while this is certainly a good album, it is definitely not his best. Carlos Santana's best work is certainly behind him. Abraxsas is the album that should have won him all of the Grammy's; however, it is only now that society will allow black or hispanic artists to recieve the credit they desereve. Nonetheless, Supernatural gives audiences of today something to remember this great artist by."
3,Not like his classic stuff,"Although this CD is good, I wouldn't call it the best. It pulls away from this classical style. It is a good cd to introduce younger generations to, with the different styles of music on it, however it is just too comercialized."
3,"Could be better, could be worse.","Well, Carlos seems to have given in to the commercialization of his art. However with the success of this collection, in awards and, most importantly, money, who can blame him. The CD certainly has it's highlights. I do enjoy Smooth because of the fresh vocals mixed with Santana's classic guitar riffs. There are other songs worth listening to as well, including his bluesy duet with Eric Clapton but overall this isn't a very good Santana effort. Take my advise, if you're a Santana fan pass on this, you'll be disappointed. However if you're into the latest ""music fad"" then invest. You'll listen to it once or twice a year and eventually forget about it."
5,The Santana Legacy,"Wow! To think that Santana played at the Woodstock Festival way back in 1969 as an accomplished artist, be out of the major music scene for so long, and then pull off this record. Carlos Santana is now officially a rock legend in my opinion. Not many musicians have ever been able to invite so many generas to one record with success. But Santana did, and with overwhelming success to boot. All of the tracks reflect his latin background to some degree which I like. It's true that there are some tracks on here that I enjoy more than others but they all are fantastic musical compositions. I think Rob Thomas is a great vocalist, but I didn't realize this until I heard him on ""Smooth"". Everlast and Eagle-Eye Cherry also did a fantastic job on ""Put Your Lights On"" and ""Wishing It Was"". My hat is off to you Carlos Santana for putting together and being successful with such a large and difficult undertaking, one that I will cherish for a long time."
4,Good CD,"This is a really good disc, but I realize that for most of the people who bought it, its their first purchase of Santana and they bought it because they heard Smooth on the radio. This disc is good, but its nothing compared to Santana's stuff from the 60s and 70s. Listen to that stuff and this sounds weak."
3,Santana the collaborator,"Let me first say that I love Carlos: no one has more generosity and heart. He continues to play beautiful music that is always renewed by collaborative efforts. I am impressed by a few tracks here especially ""Smooth"". If you like the ""interactive"" and ""collaborative"" Carlos let me STRONLY recommend a CD called ""Love, Devotion, Surrender"": an extended jam with John McLaughlin, arguably the heaviest guitarist on the planet. For thirty years now McLaughlin has been a mentor, teacher, and best friend to Carlos."
3,Not As Good As You Might Think!,"This CD is mostly overrated. If you want real Santana, check out the following CDs. There are remastered imports at the end of the listings for many of these top rated CDs. Inner Secrets, Shango, Marathon, Zebop, Freedom, Beyond Appearances, Spirits Dancing In The Flesh, Blues for Salvador, Milagro, etc. The latter Santana releases are just as good as the early gems. Santana has grown by leaps and bounds since the Black Magic Woman days. I encourage you to get a remastered (import) copy of this. Amazon just listed all of the remasters for these, but they are listed at the end. These should be up front, because many people will miss out on the limited releases of these. The early CDs to get are as follows: Santana 3 (remastered), Caravanserai, Amigos, Oneness (Silver Dream, Golden Reality) and the live 2 CD masterpiece Moonflower."
2,Great Marketing Scheme,"When Tina Turner made her comeback, she didn't rely on a bunch of ""guest stars"". Anybody can go out and get a bunch of stars to guest on their album. The only reason why this album is selling is because of the guest stars and the Latin pop craze that's going on these days. And the only reason why Santana won those Grammies is because the Grammy committee love to honor vets, especially those who score big comebacks. If you really want to hear Santana, stick with the older albums."
2,Barely listenable,"I've been a Santana fan ever since I was turned on to them in 1984 and consider Carlos & Co (and the various permutations of the band) one of my all-time favorite atrists. I was disappointed with SUPERNATURAL from the moment I listened to it. There is little on this album that is not re-manufactured pop, and it in no way highlights the exceptional musicianship or band interplay that Santana is known for. Songs like ""Maria, Maria"" and ""Turn Your Lights On"" are about as far from the classic Santana sound as one can get, and the entire collection of songs has the tired ""let's-try-to-write-a-hit-single-and-make-some-big-money"" kind of feel.If you are seeking Santana at their pop best, check out ""Zebop"" or Beyond Appearances"" instead. If you want Santana at their very best, buy the first three albums and the ""LOTUS"" live album as each of these four are masterpieces. Avoid SUPERNATURAL."
1,Get Real,"The fact is that without Rob Thomas, this would have been another overlooked Santana album. Since Matchbox had waited so long to release another album, people were willing to buy this to get a fresh track from Rob. ""Smooth"" gets 5-stars. Most of the rest gets 1-star. Average: 1-star."
1,Bubble Music,"Absolutley the worst garbage to hit the musice industry since ricky martin, the backdoor boys, and n sick. what next..."
1,Highly over-rated - Please do not buy this travesty,This cd is way over-hyped. It's trite and the lyrics are unbearingly predictable. It's commercialism to the max. and any integrity is totally watered down to appeal to a broad mass of pseudo-spritualists. It reminds me of Madonna's album which was supposed to be about enlightenment and her discovering spirituality. Oh please..This cd is a sell-out and is to spirituality what Britney Spears is to pop music.This cd makes me want to vomit!
1,Just read the credits and get sick ...,"I fell for the hype and I have regretted it. If you want to listen to Carlo's sublime riffs you are much better off listening to his old albums. The lyrics on this one (although not by the ""icon"" himself - he just cashes in big time ..) make me think of either some guy that never got off the LSD trip he took once back in the 70's or of someone who suddenly found out he suffers from an incurable disease and - too late - decides that life is all about love and light and ""Whoo-aohaha hey lala"" (yes they sing this ..) - It's simply too much ..."
2,Mediocre Album,"The first point I will make is that Carlos Santana is an amazing talent and one of the best guitar players to ever live...but this album is just a marketing strategy designed to use Santana's style and musical credibility and mix it with an MTV-friendly sound and thus sell millions of records. As we all know it worked like charm. Yet this album is a mediocre musical accomplishment. Santana's style and the style of whoever the guest artist is does never really congeal into one in any track of this album, save a few exceptions. And it is a real shame bacause Santana's talent and a few fresh ideas is all you need to a great record. No necessity to invite every trendy MTV performer to play with you."
2,Music Amalgams are dicey products,I can imagine some record producer telling Carlos Santana to use a variety of recording artists from several music disciplines to boost the audience appeal of this album. Santana took this advice and created an album that appeals to no one in general. I liked 2-3 tunes very much but I find that I must skip over the majority of the disc as it is not something I find a delight to hear. Carlos Santana was not a rapper and I don't find the fusion of his work with rap to be of value. I would have preferred that he take one genre and built an entire CD around it rather than jam several into one.
1,"Same old guy, same old solo!","Who awarded this ""Album of the Year""? One great song doesn't make one great album. He's still playing the same solo 25 years on. So what's the difference - marketing! If you want the real thing, buy Abraxus."
3,"good, but overrated","I am not a long time Santana listener, so I can't comment on how it compares with his other stuff. Still, I thought it was an OK album. I have heard better, but I hav heard a lot worse as well. The only ""song"" that really needed to be dumped was the rap one(rap is NOT music!). Also, Smooth, while OK is not the best one on there. African Bamba, Lights on, a few other are much better, and have not been played on the radio wayyy too many times. Again; I do not usually listen to this type of music (Mettalica and other metal groups are more my speed), so I cannot compare it to his other stuff, but for chrissakes, don't complain that a musician changes. So, to reiterate, you won't be too dissapointed, but you won't be tooo pleased either. I'd wait to get it as a gift, and not shell out the cash."
1,Commercial Radio,"Although Santana is a good guitar player, the only reason this CD got air play and won loads of Grammys it didn't deserve is because (a) lots of pop stars to grab the young audience, and (b) the guy has been doing this for 40 years, and the Grammys are awards reserved for washed up veterans who try to mount a comeback, or for new bands that will only have one good song (the Oscars do the same thing: see Topsy-Turvy). The songs are an unrealted mess, in which each track was made for the sole purpose of selling CDs, not because of any musical value."
2,2 and a half stars is what I want to give it.,Is this Santana or a bunch of other artists. It seems they took the commercial safe way out on this one - thinly disguised as contemporary cultural melange. Pugh. Santana by himself has more soul and integrity.
2,"Why, Mr. Santana . . . why!?","This album is just another great example of how pop and top 40 music is taking over the woorrllddd!! I'm fifteen years old and have liked Santana ever since my parents played it for me. So, when I heard all the talk about his new album and how great it was supposed to be, I thought to myself, 'Hey! Maybe I should go out and buy that!' So I did. Oh dear. I look at the track listing, and EIGHT of the thirteen songs are ""featuring"" another artist. Weeeee! It's too bad that those songs aren't any good. Most of the songs that have gotten air time on the radio sound NOTHING like Santana, and a lot like they should be on the featured artist's album. I give this album two stars for the songs that aren't featuring anyone, like Yaleo and Africa Bamba. If you want good music, get Abraxas or Santana or Moonflower. If you want stuff that sounds like everything else out there, buy Supernatural!"
4,What's all the dissing Santana about?,"This veteran Latino rocker just busted the former King of Pop'srecords recently, as ""Supernatural"" surpassed MichaelJackson's Grammy record for a single year (it won nine, NOT eight), and international sales of the album amassed 50 million plus! Sorry, Mike, and those of you who gave this album less than three stars or who don't own this album obviously are missing out big time on the wonderful bonuses ""Supernatural"" has to offer. Well, the first seven songs are a knockout. Those songs were played on a Fox concert over a week ago. Carlos Santana has been along around the same time that Mike was, but man, can he play the guitar! And ""The Love of My Life,"" ""Put Your Lights On,"" ""Smooth,"" and ""Maria Maria"" are masterpieces. (The Product G&B sang the latter of these.) Personally, I'm glad to have seen sexy Santana knock Wacko Jacko off his throne once and for all."
5,Supernatural - Awesome,"I think it is grwat that Carlos Santana is giving other artisits a chance to jam with him. He is a legend along with Eric Clapton, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and others. Carlos just wants to truly enjoy music. It is no longer about making a buck! Loosen up people and do not judge this man and the other artisits so harshly."
4,Santana continues to grow and get better.,"Too bad to all of you who say ""Bring back the old Santana""...and ""Bill Grahmn (whoever that is) would roll over in his grave, blah blah."" Santana, the musician, continues to grow and get better, giving his all to his art and sharing it with us. I remember the same level of criticism leveled at Miles Davis every time he would expand his horizons. ""Bring back the 'old' Miles!"" Hey y'all, get over yourselves and let the consumate, and consumed, artists do their things. Rock on, Carlos! This album is another step on your journey and thank you for bringing us along."
4,I think the music is great for the summer.,It makes you want to get up and DANCE!! I love the Cd and Just buy it!! It's great!
2,No Black Magic Here.,"Have always thought of Santana as one of the best guitatist and song writers.This Cd has nothing to it.Bring back the old Santana,the one that opened up for three dogg night and Canned heat at the Filemore East back in 68.I was there at there first show ever on the east Coast.Bill Grhamn would roll over in his grave if he ever heard this garbage,"
5,If you're a modern person and love Santana,"Listen to it a few times. Carlos still has it! Never mind the naysayers. Sure, it's not Moonflower. What could be? But if you're into Carlos, it's still got soul! How rare is that today?"
4,GREAT WORKSMENSHIP,This is santana's best work yet. The album is right on target in pushing the sound to your heart and soul. The one point was taken off because of the horrible song done with the untalented Lauryn Hill.
4,Santana's album suprisingly catchy,"I'd never really heard of Santana before this album came out, I mean, he was a little before my time, but my best friend had the CD and I heard ""Smooth"" (This was before it became the radio favorite that is is now, and I'm sure everyone is so sick of it they never want to hear it again) and I loved it, I thought it was such a good song, so i bought the CD and found out that there are SO many good songs on this album. ""Put your Lights On"", ""Maria Maria"", and my personal favorite, ""Love of my Life"" are all amazing songs. I never would have guesses that this album would be one of my favorite of the year, but it is. Santana is nothing short of a master on the guitar, and he mixed his talent with popular artists of today to come up with something pretty incredible."
5,glad I got it,"I hesitated while buying this CD, fearful of the ""Guest Star"" approach - which usually is the sign of a floundering artist - not so in this case, and I should have known as Santana has flip/flopped singers alot in the past. Very, very enjoyable.."
5,A must own CD!,"This is an excellent ""compilation"" if you will. Santana's terrific riffs are masterful and the joint work with other hot artists is spectacular. I do not know much about Lauryn Hill, but I think the track with her is exciting and riveting. I wouldn't consider myself a rap ""fan"", but this track intrigues me to find more of her. The Clapton tune is excellent. A fabulous blend of guitar gurus! Dave Matthews, Everlast, Mana...all brilliant. Relative new comer Eagle Eye Cherry lends a powerful flavor to an incredible CD. Get in your car, turn up the bass a bit more than usual, drive and marvel. Watch your speed though..it carries you away!"
3,No match for the hype,"Carlos Santana is a fine musician, but unless you are already in love with him, you will wonder why the world has gone so wild over such an ordinary album."
3,Expand your mind.,"If you're expecting Pop, keep looking. This is a genuine original. The talents of this artist are complimented by other well-established musicians. Like a classic novel, you cannot appreciate the style by skimming through it. Listen. Enjoy! My compliments to Santana for supporting a charity with the proceeds."
3,Santana back on top!,"Amazon reviews for these two are all over the place.Supernatural:4&5 stars - 831(70%)1-3 stars - 248total reviews: 1079.So there must be something to this album if somany people bothered to vote and write reviews.Congrats to Carlos for winning so many Grammys.Shaman:4&5 stars - 1471-3 stars - 84(%57)total reviews: 2311/4 number of votes, and more less favorable.But compared to what? If to Supernatural, fine; if to some crappy 80's synth-popdrum machine albums, or to 70's jazz-fusion albums, I disagree.I buy Santana to listen to what he is known for: Latin rock, not jazz, or 80's rhythms."
3,Just Another Good Santana Album,"I've loved Carlos Santana since I learned to play guitar by copying his licks on Abraxas 30 years ago. He was great then and he's great now but after all the changes in his career, the horns, becoming Devadip, etc., and now he's doing the same idioms and licks as on the best Abraxas cuts. So what's new? What's new is that he's assembled a terrific group of artists and writers to create this work, but Carlos himself is merely being his old, great self. I guess it's to his credit that he's still doing it. After all, how many players on the Woodstock album are even still alive?"
5,Supernatural is the correct name for this Classic,"I got this CD for a Christmas present.I played it today,April 6 after working a hard week of the night turn shift. All I wanted to do was have a couple of drinks,and enjoy this Grammy winning record.When,"" (Da Le) Yaleo"" came on,I found myself dancing aroung the living room like a teenager.What a great opening number from one of the greatest albums I've heard in ages.""Put your light's on""by Everlast,is wonderfull.""Smooth"" by Rob Thomas,will be a classic that will live forever.After playing this Masterpiece featuring Musicians from Lauryn Hill to Eric Clapton,I wanted to know what record company would put there faith in a Artist that was over 40.The anser is Clive Davis, who was just voted into the rock and roll hall of fame.Clive Davis has the only record company,Arista,that belives in talent,not youth."
1,Santana,"... he's pretty good, his only really good song is Smooth, the reason he's not to popular is that you go out and buy his new album just to fund out he just released 12 more, I mean come on, this guy has over 60 albums out in just America alone!"
3,good but over hyped and over played,i bought this cd when it first came out b/c i saw Dave Matthews and Rob Thomas on the lable....before all the hype and publicity. I've been a fan of DMB for a while and i was happy to finally see something new from MIA Rob Thomas. and it was cool. but damn people it's not THAT great! those really are the only two cool songs on the album...except maybe Everlast...but hey so what?
1,A mistake on my part,"Okay, I admit, I should have known I wouldn't like this CD. I only knew a couple of the older Santana songs, so I guess I wasn't really familiar with his sound. But, I bought this one anyway. After I listened to it twice (had to give it a second chance), I sold it to a used CD store. Oh well, live and learn...."
1,music prostitution at it's best,This album is on of the best examples of music prostitution of an artist in need of money and/or willing get his glory back. Just get the old stuff.
1,I've had trouble getting into this.,"I don't get the hype. I've played this several times. I've started in the middle of the CD. I've played one song at a time. And I still don't get it. This is not good music. Caveat emptor! Mr. Santana, who used to be a premier guitarist, has now resorted to performing with artists who give themselves juvenile names like ""Eagle Eyed Cherry"". Well, Mr. Santana. It is time to grow up."
3,"Ok, but you better be a BIG fan","Well, let there be no doubt in your mind it is Calos Santana. It could arguably be his better work, but you better be a big Santana fan. Myself, I like his work, but the endless guitar riffs get old. The songs sound the same, except the collaborative songs, which were nothing more than record company 'put togethers,' trying to pair Carlos with modern day artists to sell more cd's to the younger crowd, good music, but not what I would expect or want from Carlos. Good album overall, but he hasn't changed or grown musically vrey much over the last 20 years. I think he may need more creative control over what he's doing, then we'll get a gem from Santana."
2,"Half good, half wretched....","The songs by the Santana band just by themselves are great, the guest appearances however are awful (with exception of The Calling w/Eric Clapton).If you really want this, make a tape or a Mini Disc of the good stuff from someone else's CD and save your money. Go and buy Abraxas instead. I'll give Supernatural two and a half stars based on the Santana-only tracks."
2,"Two stars for Santana's past music, but NOT for this album","When I heard Santana I was really expecting a good cd, but I was very disappointed with this.The collaborations seemed to be so commercial and superficial it isn't funny. Like he wanted to make some money fast.If you know Santana, you would know that he is a very good musician, but this album does him no justice. I wouldn't invest the money in this. It's just not worth it. Sure it sells, but so do BackStreet Boys. I wonder who are the type of people buying this music and thinking it's so wonderful. I feel sorry for them. Invest your money in a past Santana cd instead, you'll be infinitely more satisfied."
1,Move Over Backstreet Boys!,"Remember Santana? Really hot in the 70's. Played at the original Woodstock. Well, he didn't really make it until this year when pop stations began squeezing his tunes between Brittany Spears and N'Sync. Now I think he's hosting Nickelodian's Teen Choice Awards with that other Latin hunk Ricky Martin. I hope Santana's original fans are as forgiving as his new fanbase is shallow."
2,I enjoyed one song,Maria Maria is cool. The restyou can find in file 13. Heis like some singers who isa one good song singer.
1,Look at the dates of the reviews...,"There have been five reviews already on this and if you look at the dates on the first three, they posted their comments before the CD had even been released. I'm buying this for my wife today. I base my decision on the last two reviews, since those folks have listened to the CD. But, c'mon, folks. Don't post a review if you haven't heard the CD!"
2,No big surprise,"After listening to this cd,I found it no different than other Santana cd's over the past 20 years, other than the parade of headliners.In truth, when Tom Coster left the band,Santana's weakness in composing was sorely exposed, and we got an endless series of surupy, uninspired pop music.I believe Carlos' intentions are sincere,but extremely naive about the power of music to transform lives.However, we are living in decadent times with nothing really to inspire people. I believe he has missed the point that art inspires, not juvenile lyrics or gimmicks.Carlos needs to get back to that premise, and what he has learned from Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, and John Coltrane, for they will not be forgotten."
1,WHY?,"I fell for the hype and I have regretted it. If you want to listen to Carlo's sublime riffs you are much better off listening to his old albums. The lyrics on this one make me think of either some guy that never got off the LSD trip he took once back in the 70's or of someone who suddenly found out he suffers from an incurable disease and - too late - decides that life is all about love and light and ""Whoo-aohaha hey lala"" (yes his sings this ..) - It's simply too much ..."
1,EGO Tripper,Maria Maria she remind of Santanas worst album singing with wyclef and all the horrible artist of today.I am suprised there aint any duets with 98 degrees
1,turn it off!,"I really haven't listened to much of Santana... and I'm glad. What's so great about this album? Or maybe I should ask, why is his name on it? I can't stand ""Smooth"" or that other new song. Please, someone explain to me what makes this guy such a ""talented"" musician! (yanksarethebest@hotmail.com) p.s. I would've given 0 stars if it were possible."
1,A DISGRACE to Santana,"I have and always will listen to the OLD Santana from the 70'sand maybe even early 80's. Santana has been through 16 differentmakeovers, and he's finally decided to go solo - almost. Carlos has teamed up with the biggest radio-wonderboys alive. This album did not deserve a single grammy.I URGE ANYONE WHO IS NEW TO THE SANTANA EXPERIENCE, OR A SANTANA VETERAN - DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. IT IS A DISGRACE TO LATIN ROCK."
2,Me give two big a stars,I go in a record shop on saturday and ask Joe me question. what you think I like. SAntana. Me say's Me never heard of santana. But me get anyway. It ok. But me say's as fiona says he need paper bag.
2,"SANTANA - THERE GOES THE ""TIE-DYE"" SHIRT AND BANDANA?","I have loved your music since the 60's! You were the last true holdout, the artist who put style and work over corporate America! No more, even with your magnificent work in the Latin numbers on this CD, once you introduced the modern artist (and I use modern artist loosely), the album went from 5 stars to 2 stars! I guess you needed the money, otherwise you would not have sold out to attract the younger dollar, but then again, it is all about greed isn't it? Too bad, you were one of the few left that I thought was pure magic and like all fairytales, yours is another one with this CD that has an unhappy ending!"
1,My friend's ask me to buy it.,"It's true my friend Penny ask me to buy this cd on Sunday. I said no way. I wont do it. So she buy's it and play's it on the way to her place. I told her to shut it off. I do hate this guy who comes out over the blue and does and album and then at the award's show,takes and award from The Dixie Chick's. The best female band ever. You may now wonder if my friend Penny turned it off. She did it, but she was mad."
1,Rob Thomas - and nobody else,"Okay, Santana is this old guy who thinks he has some sort of guitar talent. He feels special now because of his number one album and number one single of 1999...WELL WHO DO YOU THINK CAUSED ALL OF HIS SUCCESS? His success is all from the souful song-writing and lyrical stylings of Rob Thomas. No other person could have written such a gorgeous, touching song; Santana tries to play up to Rob's standards but fails considerably. The only reason to buy this album is to get the full version of ""Smooth."" However, I do not recommend doing so because by buying the single, you help Billboard sales and the only thing missing is some of the terrible guitar playing of Santana. If you like ""Smooth,"" buy matchbox20's album ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" and wait with me for their new album early next year! I gave the one star for Rob Thomas only! Long live King Rob Thomas :)"
4,Past Present Future,Having been a Santana fan for ever. I know that his music has always evolved. He is an accomplished artist assimilating other forms of music and giving it his unique style and sound.Carlos makes a excellent exampler of bridging his past accomplishments to bear. Some of his sounds on this cd brought back some of his classics. Will this be a classic ? Well like his other stuff the more you listen it the better it gets. Time will tell. Carlos has always been an a experimenter this cd is just that. I also like his collaborations with Clapton and Mathews.
2,Half Good,"I thought this was half good (and the converse). I was ready for more. Santana is awesome. Thought the Clapton track a bore, the Wyclef track marginal and found myself skipping to the more traditional latin sounding tracks. This should win the grammy (have you seen what it is up against?) which shows how meaningless that is."
1,time to retire or re-iterate,"I am a huge fan of instrumental Santana, and there is only some of that here. I think all of the guest singers kind of break the momentum because the styles jump back and forth with no flow. To truly experience Santana, see him in concert, without all of the singing. Kind of dissapointing result overall"
5,"""Smooth"" with Rob Thomas is great, but about 5th best on CD","This is one of Santana's best works. It will stand up many years from now. Anyone who buys it to hear Rob Thomas or Dave Matthews is truly missing my point. Santana is not a sideman, but in my mind clearly demonstrates that his range and the depth of his ability is beyond ANYONE performing today. I saw the show at the Concord Pavillion in August and the performance stunned the sellout crowd of 12,500. Buy the CD and a month later you""ll like it even more. Viva Santana. Surely a national treasure."
3,Santana,"Santana is a genius on the guitar, and this CD is no different. While a few of the songs stand out as great tunes, like Put Your Lights On, Smooth, and the duet with Eric Clapton, some of the songs were just a little uneventful. However, sans the Lauryn Hill song, the CD is worth a listen."
5,Rich And Exhilirating.,"Finally one of the greatest of all musicians returns! ""Supernatural"" ranks among Carlos Santana's best works. This is a rich, artistic work that is worth listening to more than once, no, more than twice! The song ""Smooth"" is a masterpiece, rich in it's textures and lyrics. ""Supernatural"" is full, musical genius unbound. Large strokes across a wide canvas of sound and energy, feeling and mood. Santana shows what real guitar music is. In a year dominated by Ricky Martin, ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" craze, it's nice to see good artistic work like ""Supernatural."" This CD displays the true art of the musician and his instrument. A masterpiece."
5,OOOOOh I love it!,"I just love that song ""Smooth"" featuring Rob Thomas! I love the latin feel to it. And I love the rhythm and sound to it. There's just something about this song I can't explain. But I fell complelely in love with this song the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since. It's the kind of song that just gets stuck in your head for days but you don't care b/c it's such an awesome song!"
2,This is crap - 2 points for effort,"The only reason this album is doing well is because the lead singer from Matchbox 20 does a gig with them Were it not for him this album would be at the bottom of the pile. Sorry, this album just plain sucks.... Santana does 90's music like Rod Stewart did disco - How Original! PLEASE!!!!! If you can't write your own style of music (i.e. Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, Def Leppard (New Album), Great White (New Album) - All of which have newer music and great tunes) and release it when it may be out of it's time, then you aren't true to your fans."
2,Highly Overated,"My apologies to all of you who may worship this CD but there is much better stuff out there. With the exception of the incredibly-overplayed single, ""Smooth"" this album is an absolute bore with nothing but a smattering of light Latin pop tunes. THIS IS NOT ROCK! If you are rock fan, then don't bother buying this. The Red Hot Chili Peppers put out a fantastic album this year (Californication) and should have received more awards than they did; as should have many other artists. The Recording Academy is a poor judge of music and always likes to make Grammy night a one-man show. If you have not bought this CD yet, then may I recommend that you do not. Don't get sucked into the Grammy hype; buy what you know is truly good music."
2,Very predictable. Mediocre at best.,"I was listening to some of the tracks and I couldn't bear the predictability of the upcoming lyrics. I had to stop the cd, I can only listen to it in 5 minute intervals. It's over-done, but you know with all things,you have to overdo it if you want to become commercial, and that's too bad because all the integrity and artistry is gone...zippo...But if you like commercial shmaltz, go ahead...eat it up...have a ball... go crazy with Backstreet Boys, Britney and and the rest of the gang...(of course I'm exaggerating, but the scarey thing is...I'm not exaggerating all that much)Bottom line.....Don't buy. You'll be sorry you did. Trust me."
2,Why is this album credited under 'Santana'?,"Santana didn't write any of the songs on this album. He didn't sing them either. What DID he do? Well, he contributed a guitar solo. Woo hoo hoo. I'm not really saying this album is BAD (there are a few good songs on it), but this isn't a Santana album in almost every possible way."
5,i love this cd!,on my opinion that's the best cd of the year! i hear it 24 hours a day and i never get tired of it. great music by a great artist!
2,comeercial,this is strictly commercial album. It is a pitty and very ironic that Santana received bunch of Grammys for it. I would put it in the third dozen of all time Santana's works.
5,"Excellent , #1 Rock/Latin CD of 99! Santana still rockin","I have seen Santana live in concert twice in Florida way before this CD came out. He has always been an excellent guitairist with excellent songs, he can make music that brings out your spiritual, sensitive side, to rockin latin styles. I think the song SMOOTH is great as in bringing him out and making him more noticable to those who never heard him for the past 20 years. He is a legend, and there are other songs on this CD that are even better than SMOOTH! it is an EXCELLLLLENT line-up of songs, TRACKS I recommend are 1,2,3,4,7,and 11. those are my favorite!"
3,Supernatural fails to credit Johannes Brahms,"Nowhere is it mentioned that the tune and basic harmonic structure of Santana's ""collaboration"" with Dave Matthews (Love of My Life) is completely lifted from the third movement of Brahms' Symphony #3! Lengthening Brahms's triple meter into 4/4, and displacing his downbeats back an eighth doesn't qualify Santana and Matthews to claim authorship, but apparently they do anyway. They, and the record company, should be ashamed of the fraud here.The song, by the way, is terrific in its own right...especially in Matthews' clear and elegant extensions to the vocal lines."
4,SUPER FLY FUNKY SILLY FRESH!,Carlos Santana is the best rapper of all time! He can bust a phat beat like nobody else! He sounds a lot like Snoop Dog. His afro is pretty chillen too! Only 4 stars because I still can't beleive he didn't feature my boy Puff Daddy and he broke his label with Death Row records.
5,Supernatural,"This CD is one of the best CDs ever. Itr displays a variety of wonderful, breath-taking, mind moving,exquisite songs that will catch your brain from whatever you are doing. It makes you dance, play, be like whoever you want to be. When I first heard it, I was relieved! Santana takes your mind off what your mind is on."
2,enuf already !,"Anybody who is a real Santana fan knows that as a musician, he is much more capable of better work than this collection of kitch, with guests who won't be remebered 5 years from now. However;I still love Santana's heartfelt guitar, despite his composittional failings."
3,I expected better from Carlos Santana,"Well, I certainly didn't expect this album to be quite so ""pop-ish"" as it is. I wanted more of the old Santana, the stuff like he did back in the '70's, and there's not much of that in this album. ""Smooth"" is a good tune that has been overplayed, and the rest of the cuts just don't stand out for me for some reason. If you've been a Santana fan for a while, you might want to make sure you listen to the CD before you buy it if it's possible."
2,Commercial clap-trap,"I'm extremely glad that Carlos got the recognition that he so belatedly deservs, at the Grammies and with the buying public in general, but for ""Supernatural""? Give me a break. I think he sold-out here, but I can't blame the guy for wanting to be commercially successful. Go get ""Blues for Salvador"" and make your own comparisons. Even his earliest group stuff sounds fresh today."
1,Not too good,"I did not like this CD too much, It is not anywhere as good as abraxas or any of his other CDs. I dont think this CD is very good at all, the songs are all mostly bad. I would NOT recommend buying this CD, but abraxas is a old but very good album."
5,"so smooth, so good...","Say what you will about Santana's latest, but it's nothing short of astonishing! You're not going to want to read a full-blown review from a little ole' amateur such as myself, but with the exception of Lauryn Hill's one track this is as perfect and diversified a album can be.Yes, it's probably true that the main reason for the success of Supernatural lies with the 'guest' musicians, but Carlos is the glue that holds 'em all together. Not just the current singles, but for the ones to come...This is truly the one CD that seems to have pleased everyone. Newcomers take note...the true essence of this milagro is the man himself...way to go Carlos, you truly rock."
4,Santana kicks,"I was very impressed with this album, and glad they kept the so called rap ""music"" to a minimum!"
4,Comprehensive and comprehensible,"An excellent survey of the history of human weapon use, looking at the social, political and psychological context in which development took place. Shows its age in a somewhat dark foreboding tone, having been completed shortly before Gorbachev began dismantling the Cold War and the Soviet Union itself."
3,Evolution of Technology and Warfare,"Scholarly analysis of technologies impact on war. Chronicles the evolution of politics and economics into study of technology and warfare. Striking narrative of how the evolution of weaponry changes the nature of war and how man perceives war. In an era were defense budgets are centered on technology, this book infuses man into the equation."
4,Demonstrates the ability of good mechanics in pitching.,This book demonstrates the ability to have better and well prepare mechanics.Will give you an edge on your pitching to become the best!!!
1,made lips peel - no response from Savannah Bee Company,I spoke to a seller about this at a craft fair. He maintained it was a great product and sure to not bother people's lips.This product made my lips peel and hurt after one day of use. It was very uncomfortable and took about a week to heal.I contacted the company to let them know about the problem and recieved no response.
4,"Good remixes, but not great.","The single ""Enjoy the silence"" is my favorite song ever and Depeche Mode is my favorite band ever. Although the none of the band's songs have a need to be remixed, I particularly ""Enjoy""ed their Ecstatic Dub and Rikki Tik Tik versions. I am a bit disappointed, however, that Flood wasn't as innovative on this CD single as he was on some other of Depeche Mode's songs. Also, a part of me wishes that David Gahan actually sang ""Enjoy the Silence""'s lyrics in the remixes, but the songs are good nonetheless. Altogether, I rate this CD a 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Word are very unnecessary.,"This is the CD single of Depeche Mode's biggest hit. Great song, with six remixes. Some of the remixes are more interesting than others, with the versions without most of the lyrics being least enthralling. The other tracks here are ""Sibeling"" and ""Mempisto"", which are piano instrumentals that sound like horror movie themes. They are decent, but nothing great, really."
3,Has some good mixes and not so good mixes,This is overall a good CD but some of the mixes are a little weird i.e. the rikki tiki mix is strange.
4,Great for 'Little Hood Rat Friend' alone,"with the other songs somewhere between good and quite good. This is a really neat, fun band that I hope gets more recognition."
4,Rock Music is Saved,"True- many of the songs sound similar. True- The Hold Steady rock hard, front to back, have entertaining lyrics, and can flat out play. A great band who won't revolutionize music, but might just make it enjoyable again."
5,At the risk of sound cliche-ish...,"...here's what you'll find on this record...crunchy, buzzing guitars...thrilling keyboard fills...taut, precise drumming...melodies you'll be humming for days...words, words, and more words...all tucked into a tidy 42 minutes and change.All this and Craig Finn too.Wow.Still not sure?Okay, it's 1978 and Bob Geldof has written a rock opera, sets it aside and forgets about it.It's 2005 and he's rediscovered it and recorded it with The Boomtown Rats.And it's called SEPARATION SUNDAY.Forgive me Hold Steady, but that's the way I hear this and that's a VERY good thing.You guys rock. Don't stop."
1,a unique band; in a bad way,"The style of the Hold Steady gets old really fast; the singer doesn't even sing, he only talks while guitar goes on in the background. That sounded fine to me on the first song, but then I listened further and soon was getting bored with the repetitive nature of the songs. THe only song that pulls off this style is ""Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head"" by Gorillaz, which has narration more than singing. Cake also is kind of more narration than singing but only slightly. Anyway, the Hold Steady are an awful band who will probably fade into nothingness soon seeing that only 20 people have bothered to review it on Amazon."
4,Don't judge after one listen...................,"Having not heard their first release, I was a little put off at first with the narritive, boozy, lyrics. But as I got into the meat of the album they began to wear on me and now after a couple of full listens, they are infectious. It reminds me of what Thin Lizzy would sound like if they were fronted by Bruce Springsteen after having downed a six pack. The guitar hooks and hammond organ licks fill in perfectly behind the narritive lyrics. Don't expect any choruses here, and that's specifically part of the charm."
3,"Oh, and by the way, he's not singing...","I couldn't help but notice that Craig Finn actually shouts all the lyrics. Every word of every song. Yikes. Good stuff lyrically, but I like to hear a singer that sings, and preferably one who can hold a note. Or two or three."
1,If this qualifies as one of the best of the year...,"Then indeed it was a HORRIBLE year for music. This is one of the worst albums I've ever had the misfortune of having to listen to. The singer - better to call him a blatherskite - does nothing but mumblespeak nonsense. There are a thousand bands like this playing small venues and bars all over, yet THIS is singled out as one of the BEST albums of 2005??!? After this cd was over I promptly took it out of the player and flipped it in the trash. What a waste. That anyone could listen to this cd more than once confounds me. The singer is nothing but a poor man's poor man's David Lowery (minus any ability to write clever lyrics). It just goes to show that just because some people can turn on an amp, have cds pressed, and manage to get bookings doesn't mean you have any talent."
5,Best Book for Pennsylvania,"This is by far the best book for Pennsylvania. It has topographical maps of every trail from Northern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, and Southern Pennsylvania. I use this book whenever I want to hike Hawk Mountain, the Pinnacle, or bang hammers on Ringing Rocks. If you like the outdoors and want scenic views of Pennsylvania then this is the book for you! 170 of the best trails in PA from beginner to advanced. I'm a PA born hiker and I approve this book!"
1,Lost in Pennsylvania,"Without a doubt, this is the worst trail guide that I have ever used. I have done two of the hikes and I am afraid to try it again. I have found distances to be wrong, landmarks to be wrong and even trail names to be wrong. On the first hike, I was lost for nearly two hours before I was able to locate a cut-off trail at a point other than the supposedly well marked intersection. On the second, my companion and I spent an hour looking for an intersection that was poorly described. Both hikes have also included rather unattractive segments trough parking lots and along logging trails. Last summer I hiked in Poland and found more utility in trail guides written in Polish (which I don't speak) than in this book. There are several very good Pennsylvania trail guides out there; this just isn't one of them!"
3,on the road with friends.,"i purchased this movie with little to go on.it envolves three friends going on a goodbye road trip,after one is diagnosed with cancer.at one point they meet up with a girl(annie potts),from there we see love,jealousy and strife.it's all about life and how you live it.this dvd is hard to find an expensive when you do,but worth viewing."
4,Christina,Great movie!! Kind of cheesy but a good movie to watch any day. Would highly recommend for one of those days you have nothing else to do
5,Very Helpful!,"This book is great. I have been trying to break into the Chick-Lit genre as a writer, and this book has been the most helpful. The authors did a great job of keeping the information simple to understand, but yet detailed enough that I got a great grasp of what's needed to write in this genre.I would recommend this book to anyone needing some pointers on writing a chick-lit novel."
1,More of a novelty book than actual substance...,"I bought this book thinking I would love to know the tricks of the trade for writing chick lit. I was WRONG! The book is written in a playful format, and does not give any real advice on the act of writing itself. All the information that is given to you could have easily been deciphered from reading any of the multitude of chick lit books written out there. Plus there is a lot of information in there that is wrong or useless! For example, NEVER EVER EVER type your manuscript the way they advise you to in this book! If you seriously want to write chick lit, read as much as you can in the genre you like and read books about writing. My favorite, and the one that helped me write my first novel, was ""The Weekend Novelist"" by Robert J. Ray."
2,This book had something to prove.,"From the first page, this book had a chip on it's shoulder. The book talked about how Chick Lit was not a light weight writing. It talked about how hard it was to write a chick lit book and not everyone can a chick lit book. I was a put off hearing this. If I thought writing chick lit was going to be easy, why did I pick up this book. In the end I mostly skimmed. Same old writing info as other books. There was input from many other authors, but since I read do not read much chick lit hearing from these authors did not exciting to me. I read Will Write for Shoes by Cathy Tardley, and it was much more fun, even thought there was less info in it. Read both, book and see what you can get from them."
4,Just Like Chick-lit,"This is a fun guide. Learn about how writing chick-lit is like therapy and dating. And forget about making excuses about not writing, Ms. Mess or Ms. Really-Busy. She's got your number. There's lots of personal experience and advice. It's like sitting down and having a conversation with some good friends.There's a downside, though. With 180 pages and lots of graphics, there isn't a lot of text. A lot of topics are covered but: a) none that aren't covered in other guides and b) none that aren't covered better in other guides. I can't see anyone picking up this book and then having the light bulb go on ""aha! I can now write a chick-lit novel!"""
3,"Very good, not perfect","This is readable, engaging, honest, clear-sighted advice on getting published in women's popular fiction and if you have what it takes, could steer you in the right direction and knock some rough edges off. The only thing I'd criticise are the 'mad libs' or How Not To's. Normally I love How Not To tips but these are annoyingly self indulgent at times, particularly a whole page devoted to a spoof bad query letter. It would be much more helpful to show the template for a good query letter, either as well as or instead of, and in this respect it's more about entertaining than being useful. Still, overall, a good read."
5,Okay Okay Okay.....,"So the lyrics are stupid. So every single song sounds almost the same. So these girls might not be that talented. But these songs are SO FUN...I mean, the words are bubbly and dumb but the beats and music to go along with it is just great. It's such a fun, care-free CD. Has no depth or message or anything. They're just 2 girls out havin fun making fun music. :-D"
1,This is awful!! I MEAN IT!!,"I can't beleive they would get a record deal!!! They can't sing, they can't dance. They are rude in interviews, the diss any respectable artist they can think of, and they're NERDY! You may say they are just having fun, but this horrendous music is not my idea of 'fun'!! I would rather watch a Sunset Beach omnibous. It is THAT bad!! They will be gone before they know it, GONE!!"
1,DAPHNE AND CELESTE ARE SO UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HATE THIS CD,IT'S TOO ANNOYING.DAPHNE AND CELESTE ARE TWO UGLYJERKS,AND THEIR MUSIC IS SO BAD!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS CD,YOU WILL BEVERY DISSAPOINTED."
1,Start the Daphne and Celeste boycott 2day!,"Perhaps the most obnoxious bunch of human beings ever to grace a recording; eclipsing such bands as bwitched, hanson and aqua to such a degree that even if you are slightly interested in pop music to any degree, this 'group' of pre-pubsecent teens will make you cringe and perhaps ponder why pop music exists in the first place if people like Daphne and Celeste are able to make a buck off our generation's terrible taste. The perky 'ugly' isn't tongue in cheek, it is a rude obnoxious anthem to people who arn't as beautiful as D and C, although not hard, these girls are obvisously very blind themselves. The other 'beautiful' single: ooh stick you' continues in the very similar teritory. The title says it all really. You have been warned. very."
1,GRAB YOUR TOMATOES!,"Oh my god these girls SUCK! I am visiting London, and made the mistake of going to a club where they played, and they had to stop the show because too many people were throwing stuff at them! They are like the Spice Girls minus the talent, and we all know that the Spice Girls suck to begin with, so you can only imagine what Daphne & Celeste must sound like! Perhaps if they lost the little girl act, wrote their own lyrics instead of making nursery school rhymes into songs, and took some voice lessons, they MIGHT have a chance! Actually, I take that back... they are hopeless no matter what they do!"
5,Very useful,Great reference and easy to use. English to spanish. Spanish to English. Is there an App in the works? That would be awesome.
1,Ummm... a little racist.,"Althought the spanish translation is accurate, I found the voice this book is written in to be somewhat disturbing. Ms. Belknap's views on ""the help"" are a little troubling. As much as I did need this book for my trip to Mexico for a riding excursion, I certainly would not need it for the asian & american ""help"" that our cooperative stable employs."
4,"Not the best, but still great","I've been listening to Hed since I met them years ago in NYC (and Jahred subsequently slept with a friend's friend, but that's another story. ha!). I love their music - it's goovy, it's funky, and you can ALWAYS bounce your head to it. Blackout, their third release, may be their hardest album - which also means it's more hard-rock than their usual mix of styles. If you're looking for a good album of theirs to start with, pick up Broke - that album best showcases their multifaceted style. But Blackout is still really great, and any fan should pick it up this instant!"
5,"If it's good 4 U, then it must B good 4 every1","All I can say is that it's a good CD, & that people like Hunter Lind, have too much time on their hands, if they can rate every song."
3,once in a great while this album makes my cd changer.,"I do like this band, but not as much as the other things i listen to(read my other reviews). This album is very quirky. I can only get hooked on the tracks Half the Man, and Carnivale. I think this band had a lot of potential. This album seems very unorganized in my opinion. I think they need a lyrical structure that is uniform and fits together. They can play (not really in my opinion as a killer musician), and they just need some solid ground. I only like to listen to this album once in a great while. Check it out. You be the Judge."
3,Good But Not Great,"(Hed) PE is one of my favorite bands, i love their originality and rock/rap funk they've done on their first 2 cds, but this one tries to ditch it to go a more successful route. By going rock and only rock, and although it is still a good cd, the lack of different types of music seems wrong after the first two cds, so if you haven't heard (Hed) before, i would reccommend it, but if you have the first two, its too boring, i would stick with the first two"
4,Change is good.,"I like how (hed) Planet Earth is changing around their sound alot on each album.Some bands just do the same formula over and over again and it gets boring (I'm not going to name any bands). Their last truly great album, 'Broke' had alot of rap and rock mixed together and was rap metal done right.'Blackout' is mostly just ""alternative rock done right"",and its solid all the way through.Some songs have lyrics that are medicore though,but the good outweighs the bad on this one.Also,while its a change for (hed) Planet Earth,its not exactly groundbreaking.This is still a very good efford from (hed) Planet Earth and I look foward from hearing more from them in the future."
5,Mind over reading matter,"I recently had the honor of meeting Ricky at a conference on ocean science at the Scripps Instituion of Oceangraphy where I work as a writer and where Grigg was a grad student. Ricky is a true hero; rare these days, and I believe one of the last of the genuine Great Watermen of the '60s. If I could climb inside a book and live there, this might just be it!"
5,This book is the real deal.,"So, perhaps you've noticed a few odd things going on in your life. You get high from being in a crowd of excited people. Sex leaves you feeling energized and your partner feeling sleepy. You seem to need more contact and attention than other people do - a lot more.You may be what is commonly referred to as a psychic vampire - someone who takes in energy from people around them. But you don't have to resign yourself to being evil, or to wondering if you're the only one out there. You're not.This book is a lifesaver. It will help you answer questions like, ""How do I get what I need ethically? What purpose do vampires serve in the human ecosystem? How can I use this talent to benefit others?""Strongly recommended for energy vampires, those who are close to them, and energy workers of all sorts."
5,One of the Best Videos of Norway,"An excellent VHS video. Narration and pronunciation of Norwegian towns, provinces and special attractions all combine to make for a very informative journey through Norway. You'll see country wedding processions, helicopter views of the fjords and mountains, roaring waterfalls, a polar bear in search of food aboard a fishing boat in Svalbard, and old photos of days long ago. The whole length of Norway is explored. It is by far the best travel movie I have seen about Norway."
3,fills a nonexistent gap,"Some results in finance are non-intuitive. Simplistic logic leads to the wrong answer. OK, that was cheaper than buying this book.If you want some examples from a number of areas of finance which demonstrate this observation, then this book is for you.If you want to be able to solve any real problems, you'll have to take the next step and actually look inside a textbook for a first course in finance. Unfortunately, this step involves learning some mathematical analysis and finding your calculator. Davis' book only helps you understand that guessing is as likely to lead you to the wrong answer as the right one.... maybe more likely, since there are a lot more wrong answers than right ones."
1,Defective!,"The pedal produced some very interesting sounds, when it worked. After a single practice where it allowed my Jackson to produces bizarre, fun, swirly spaceship noises, it stopped working. At first I heard some faint static, then nothing. The LED did not light up anymore, and no sound outputs to the rest of the signal-train. Changing the batteries did not resolve the issue, nor did connecting it to a 9V Boss power supply. The darn thing is fried, after only a day of use!This is not the legendary Boss-reliability that I have heard of. It's especially irritating when I bought a brand new unit and this happened."
2,Land of Eng thinking outside the [penalty?] box,"Usually these songs produced as sort of theme songs to cheer on England at soccer's World Cup Finals are treacly bland sort of knees up at the pub singalongs.For once the F.A. tapped into the youth scene and snagged New Order to do the tune. Only problem was this was 1990 and New Order was hardly relevant anymore. They could still churn out a tune but this is nothing special in the so-called soccer chant genre.Probably worth more as a collectors' item for soccer fans than music fans as the band are ""helped"" out by England stars Peter ""I speak like I have marbles in my mouth"" Beardsley, John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne, Steve McMahon, Chris Waddle, Des Walker and, for some inexplicable reason, Australian and Liverpool player Craig Johnston."
5,THE book about the BOOKS on the Wandering Jew and Jewess,"I am the living World expert today, fulfilling Doctor Anderson's mission to bring the legend of these extra-scriptural international legendary characters up-to-date. Funded by twenty years of Guggenheim Fellowships, this book will remain the definitive personal view-point of 2,000 years of oral and written tradition in prose, poetry, and examples of pictoral art, music, and film. My twenty years of literary property development is solely due to his thorough and thoughtful book (I self-publish screenplays on ISBN 1-895507-)."
4,A very good choice on laptop backpacks!,"A well-designed and satisfactory product for an excellent price! No mistakes here, OGIO packs are one of the best in the market. You can buy them with blinfolded eyes!"
5,Awesome and simple!,"This is my first bread machine. I made the decision to switch to completely homemade bread to help offset the cost of rising groceries. This is an awesome machine! You just follow the instructions, put all ingredients in, and it does the rest. It has 10 different settings including a jam and jelly setting! I have been making breads that you usually buy in a specialty bakery for 4 and 5 dollars for less than a dollar! I have made recipes with no trouble of the dough falling or anything. I recommend this to anyone looking to buy a bread machine to make their life simpler!"
1,not the best choice,"6 loaves of bread later, only 2 have been edible. The rapid bake does not bake through, and even the 3 hour cycle is not that great. If you want to use the full 3:40 or 3:50 cooking time you may come up with a good loaf of bread, but for the money, i would select a different machine. The recipe book is also a little hard to navigate.i had an old B&D; model which I used for 9 years. The quality was infinitely better!"
2,Not Impressed,"The cell phone charm is very cute and I received it in a timely manner. However, it was shipped in a padded envelope and the box that the charm came in was crushed when I got it. It also looks really cheap. The design or paint is chipping at the sharp corners, it was like that when it came out of the box. It doesn't look like it will hold up very well if you were to use it on your cell phone."
5,Simone legno-genius,It so cool how a simple idea becomes a cuteness like Simine Legno's moofia jeje I mean a box of milk becomes such cool characters.
5,An adorable and fun collectible,"These cute little collectibles seriously look great sitting just about anywhere. I got mine from a little store in Toronto. They are random, so beware getting one you don't want. My friend got ""Leche"" twice, the people at the store let her switch for a cuter one the second time though. They are little milk carton figurines, made of plastic, with all different types of milk on them. Some are in different languages. I'm considering attempting to get all of them, I just can't resist. I think they would probably be a fun little gift bag goodie for the 10 to 16 year old girl crowd. I would definitely recommend these to any kid for a gift. A girl gift, boys don't really dig cute stuff.One more thing: These are not really to play with, they are more of a decorative desk ornament."
4,What a great rerading find!,"I suggest you order all books in the series and get comfortablewith the first book. You are in for a reading treat. Great characters, realistic plots, never boring. I enjoy the interaction between Kevin & his wife, Sara. Both very strong willed people who love each other. However, they find itis not easy to love each other. Truly enjoyable. Looking forward to the next book."
3,Judge Judas Judge,"I started out with the three earlier books by this author, finished them and couldn't wait to get this, the latest. It is a worthy read if you don't have anything else to read, but I felt it was not up to the story line quality and believability as are the others. ""Interview all the gun dealers in the state..."" sounds kinda suspect to me as did the racists, hostile attitude of the guess what - the unknown son from an high school days (and nights) affair. Interviews a guy to see what cars passed him when he broke down beside the road several years earlier...I think the success of first 3 might have given him excess confidence. I will read his next, but not until it comes out in paper or I can get it at the used book store."
2,Missed the Mark,I stumbled onto McGarrity over the holidays with Hermit's Peak. Loved it and proceeded to read the others in the Kerney series. They were really fast paced and enveloped me in the beautiful geography of New Mexico. Judas Judge was a mystery that drew me in and then failed to include that spark. It was too dark and did not take me on that sightseeing tour of New Mexico.
2,Weakest of the series,"I've enjoyed the prior books in the series, but this one lacks the charm of his prior novels. The ""action"" is less believable, the pace moves slower, and the characters are less likable. As usual, McGarrity's female characters are very shallow. Because so many of this book's lead characters are female, that fault is especially problematic in The Judas Judge.The Kevin Kearney series is showing signs of decline. I don't plan to continue reading any more of them."
3,"Good read, not great read","Reading along the back trail, I find McGarrity's novels entertaining and worth the effort, but I have become convinced that his newer efforts are great improvements. Yes I would tell myself to read The Judas Judge, but.....Perhaps the framework of familial dirty laundry on the part of the title character also takes some of the spice out of this novel. I don't really want to complain too much, but I also find the bad guys pathetic rather than evil. A reader can only take so many psycho-wimps, wreaking havoc because of their thwarted childhood development. Guess I liked Othello because I just like watch Iago types. Sometimes(especially in novels) out and out evil has a role."
3,"My first in this series. Not bad, not great.","Having read through most everything written by John Sandford, I'm trying to find some other authors of the genre to enjoy. This book is ok, but not that hard to predict if you just follow the evidence the author lays out. Not much in terms of twists and turns. Much like Michael Connolly, I feel like McGarrity is trying to impress me with his knowledge of police procedure which kind of gets in the way. The one aspect I really miss from Sandford's work that other's just don't seem to do...he was a master at flashing over and telling parts of the story from the villain's perspective without giving away who it is. Judas Judge lacks depth in the characters and the plot. It isn't bad, but it won't blow you away."
4,Absorbing Reading!,"Michael McGarrity lives and works where the novel takes place. I followed the story's locals with Microsoft's ""Streets & Trips"" and can attest that even the smallest village is a real place. McGarrity's story may be fictional and his characters well constructed and believable. But, his geography and local history is non-fictional. Such details lend credence and strength to a plot that commands one's attention. It's a good read and I've just received delivery of two more McGarrity novels; ""Tularosa"" and ""Mexican Hat"". I anticipate being well entertained."
5,Another great one,"Chief Kerney--an honorable, determined, empathetic New Mexican rancher-trooper--is here up against one of the craziest passels of suspects imaginable, in a return to his natal area of the debut novel, Tularosa. The spree crimes are initially rural and simple, but the detection of the connections is not. Rather than lots of action, ex-cop author McGarrity focuses here on dogged police interviews, a skill rarely presented ""on-stage"" in thrillers. We see a new hard-nosed Kerney who persistently intimidates female witnesses--key to solving the crimes but somewhat unexplained. Conversely, Kerney's unusually well-developed personal history continues to grow, with surprising new family strains for this sensitive guy. The author spins compelling storiees with great pacing and always an enveloping sense of empty desert places and transient people. Kerney seems real, he has a life apart from his cases; I hope he doesn't retire!"
4,Rockin' good music!,I enjoy listening to this music by Richard Wiegel. He brings glimpses of experiences into his music. Carolina! should be a #1 hit!
3,Nice Sound - a bit repetitive,"Sleepy and woozy blues-tinged stuff- that's their thing. I like it, but I find I have to put it into a rotation with other cds in my changer so that I don't get sick of their sound. But they do have a good formula, so I can kind of see why they sort of work it to death, in a way."
1,Waste of time,"I am fascinated with the issues of genetics and eugenics, and thought this would be a great book. I was wrong. So so wrong. The writing style and cohesiveness of the plot left a lot to be desired."
5,VERY COLORFUL CULTURE BEATS!,"I gotta say that these guys took it many levels beyond their EP!! I actually have a couple of friends who are both Latin and Jewish, and they bugged out when they heard these tracks! I'm not Jewish, but the beats are still great for my Saturday DJ sets, and the lines are funy as hell! I wish more ""hip hop"" were this refereshing!"
3,"good, but not great","There's a lot of Jewish rap these days. Some of it is good like Chutzpah who combines humor with real cultural messages and it feels like it is made for today. Then there's Matisyahu who, for the life of me, I don't understand why he has a career. I saw him live and he soings out of tune and barely raps at all. I don't think he'd be anywhere without the Hasid dress (he only went Hasid a couple of years ago by the way---can you say gimick?). MOT are just a joke. Hoodis deinitely got something. The music is excellent, well recorded and sounds big. The rhymes are where it falls a little flat for me..I don't think calling themselves Ki#@kes is a good idea, especially when we don't share the same type fo verbal self deprication with black people. Ancient is, by far, their best track. I am into this album...worth a buy for sure, but pick up Chutzpah or So Called or Bllod of Abraham."
5,"An Excelent Book, Buy It!","You're going to love every character, but you never are going to forgot Priest Lorenzo Quart, he is a complex man but that is the best, that he is a man, no only a Catholic Priest, and also the story is excelent, the suspense and everything, you are going to enjoy it. Excelente libro donde se disfruta cada momento y cada descripción al máximo, con personajes inolvidables, todos y cada uno de ellos, donde nadie es totalmente bueno o malo, sino simplemente humanos. Pero por encima de ellos está el padre Quart, un personaje complejo, pero al que se comprende y al que se llega a amar"
3,no tan bueno,"Parece que el Sr. Perez Reverte tiene muchos admiradosres y sin duda se lo ha ganado, pero este libro (que es el primero que leo de el)no me parece tan increible, esta lleno de descripciones, sin duda bastante graficas, que despiertan la imaginacion, pero tambien esta lleno de lugares comunes: la increiblemente bella aristrocrata venida a menos, el ejecutivo arribista, los malandrines de poca monta; por cierto me harto el caracolillo de la Niña Puñales, y el final fue bastante predecible. En fin he leido mejores.Le doy tres estrellas por sus descripciones en general."
4,Buen thriller pero...,"La literatura inglesa es la estrella en los thrillers y misterios.Aquí Pérez Reverte demuestra una vez más sus brillantes e indiscutibles habilidades de narrador en una historia que mezcla diversos géneros -misterio, aventura,...-, pero no logra el dinamismo de los clásicos ingleses. Resumiendo: un buen libro pero no de esos que te corta el aliento y mantiene despierta hasta las tres de la madrugada."

2,Minimal Results -- Not Worth Your Time/Money,"Air Alert was the first Vertical Jump program I've purchased, and I DID NOT get the results I'd hoped for. They guarantee 8""-14"" so I figured that even if I only gained the bare minimum of 8"", I'd be extremely happy.I only ended up gaining about 4"" total, and while it's still a significant increase, I'm confident that I could've added the 4"" on my own, WITHOUT the help of this program.My younger brother is using a ""lesser known"" program he found online, and has already gained 6"" so I'm gonna have to give that a try next. I think the site was elitejumptraining.comIf anyone has better luck with another program, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!"
4,good program,"Without a doubt Air Alert works. For a novice athlete or gym-goer the program will still work even though you might have done most of the exercises like calf raises, squat hops, step ups, etc that the program requires you to execute three times a week. A person with no leg workout experience in the past will benefit the most from this program. I have trained my legs for over a year before starting Air Alert, but I still gained some ups from this program and I'm only on week 4 out of 15. I would guesstimate 1-2 inches already, though it guarantee's 8-14, I am not expecting that in the least. I went from getting high on the net to getting higher on the net, still not touching rim. The program might tear apart your joints and knees, so do the exercises on soft floors like carpet or grass to reduce impact. Definitely worth a shot, but it is not made for the weak that will quit after 3-4 days of using it."
1,Endurance exercises that can be very bad for the knees.,"I'm writing a review because I don't want others to go through with the injury that I've had after doing this program. I gained about an inch or two while doing it, but I had to stop during my 4th of 5th week due to my knees hurting and swelling up. My right knee felt like it was going to give. I gained some inches and endurance, but eventually had major set backs like sitting out due to knee problems. I had an MRI done that thank God showed no signs of tears on any of my ligaments, but the pain and swelling has been there ever since I did this program in 2008. I never had knee problems before, but since doing Air Alert it all changed. Wish I had read reviews about this before I set out doing it. But for all of you that are curious, this review is a warning. I'm a weekend warrior and I want you all to stay the same and injured free. So with that said, good luck! Research, try other plyometric programs, not this one. Hope this helps."
4,Biography of Ernest Hemingway,"I found parts of this book very interesting, however I was hoping to read more about the personal side of Ernest Hemingway or what made him tick. It did tell you some details in between a lot of information about wars that he was very much into - as an activist. I skimmed over those parts. For now, I've put it aside to read a few less challenging books~! But the writing is excellent."
2,good grief,"what a looooonnnnnggggg, dull book! This reads like a dissertation. It does show EH for the braggart, bully and ego maniac that he was."
1,true weight,"While this is a nice bag, serious backpackers beware. The listed weight is the insulation fill wt not the actual weight of the bag. This bag weighs 8.5 lbs which is considerably more on your back than the listed 3 lbs. A 3 lb 0 degree bag at $69.99 is in fact too good to be true."
4,A Thoughtful Study,"The dean of living revisionist historians is at his brilliant, provocative best in these essays on ""war crimes,"" Allied terror bombing, Fascism, the draft, the American mass media's wartime love affair with Stalin, America's postwar ""defense"" imperialism, and more! Indispensable for the revisionist scholar, excellent for the thoughtful young student."
3,Really Funny!,I love this -- Tom Jones covering a {artist formerly known as} Prince tune. It's awesome! Gotta love it.
4,To the point on counterpoint i the style of J.S.Bach,"This book covers counterpoint in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach. If you want to learn how to write polyphonic pieces in this style of music, this is the book. Important: It does not cover the strict vocal 17th - century - counterpoint. That style is better learned through J.J.Fux: Gradus ad Parnassum.Study of Counterpoint: From Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum"
5,Beautiful Clear Pronounciation,"In the day of MP3 Previews the music reviews are not quite important, but I liked this so much that I had to post my views.This is sure one of the best chanting albums I have heard. The pronunciation is crystal clear and very soothingly rhythmic.The cool thing is the music though, because its mostly non-traditional Indian, but a beautiful blend of Synth, and beats and strings (western Indian fusion i think. Im not a music guru).I bough Vol 3 and Vol 1 because I liked them a bit more than others, leaving others for later.Definitely a collectible! (preview yourself.)."
4,Glimpse at Americana,"This is a heartwarming glimpse into a different kind of American way of life. A band of ordinary people in a small town on Long Island tries to keep their chins up and hope alive as their way of making a living digging for clams is threatened by a larger company, driving out many of the small, family operations. The friendships and their relationships are challenged by the hardship. However, they are a close group from a long line of hard working men and women and won't go belly up, even if it means making different choices and breaking tradition.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Great sleeper!!,"Diggers is a great ""feel good"" movie. The cast is top notch. It takes you back to simpler times when smoking grass, drinking and eating pills and money problems were all you had to worry about. Hey?! That's just like present day! Superior writting. Buy it!"
3,INTERESTING FILM WORTH VIEWING,This is a fairly interesting movie with a good cast. The story centers around a small town and four off the wall friends who hang out at night and dig for clams during the day.
2,"Worth a try, I suppose...","Who could resist that adorable smiling guy on the cover of the movie, right? So I thought I'd give the story a try. It was your typical ""coming of age"", ""finding yourself"", slightly depressing, slightly frustrating, very slightly funny-at-times indie story. (Boy, if you're trying to quit smoking, don't watch this flick. Sheesh.) There were a couple of relevant messages in the story - just enough to give it 2 stars. I wouldn't watch it again."
3,fair,"It was boring, slow and drawn out. Poor story line. Scenery was good. Acting was fair. Not what I expected."
3,Amiable ensemble cast indie,"Supposedly set in 1976, this art house film borrows from movies like ""Diner"" to bring a group of male and female friends together as they hash out issues of young adulthood such as death, birth, money and the meaning of life. There's really precious little that evokes 1976 besides some TV clips of Jimmy Carter and Jerry Ford, and a few Bicentennial references that anyone under 30 won't get. Still, this is a pleasant film with a few mild laughs, almost no violence and some people you will at least not despise after 90 minutes. Lost opportunity for a much better soundtrack, but I guess that would have cost more money in licensing fees."
2,A Slice of Sealife Clam diggers,I can't say I enjoyed this movie but it was interesting to discover the world of clam diggers.
4,if you are a Bone fan you have to get!,Skant is not a member of Bone but he is a member of Mo Thug he is alright but Snoop and Bizzy Bone Kill on this album # 2 is Hot with Bizzy! !
3,Good Content,"I have had the pleasure of seeing the Randy Anderson Band live as well as having reviewed this album. I have come up with the same thoughts on the band from both occasions. First they have some really good content in their music as well as great instramental that features a variety of talent. Although my one critic would be to feature your best vocal talent more than you appear to be doing. You have a tremendously talented individual in Scotty Alexander. I think you would be better off to use him as your primary vocalist. It is nice to let everyone have a piece of the action, but Scotty will carry you if you allow him. The rest of you are ok but Scotty is heads and shoulders above the band. Make him you feature artist and you will may be amazed at the results."
1,nose clips nonfunctional,"My order arrived in a timely fashion, but the product was non functional. the rubber had melted or rotted on all of the clip straps. The style was perfect and the company refunded my money readily, but had no replacement, which I really wanted."
4,Wild honey,I believe this to be Yothu Yindi best albums yet with traditional and western style music with the added touch of pipes and the didje makes very intersting album and a very inspiring to didje players worldwide
5,A classic study of disillusionment and degeneration.,"""The Damnation of Theron Ware"" starts out as a quietly damning portrait of small-town piety, but slowly gains momentum until, at the end, it hits you like a sledgehammer. The title character, a naive, self-satisfied young Methodist minister, is a cautionary figure for us all; introduced tentatively to a world of sophistication, he loses faith in all the old verities of his life, with nothing but a few poses and attitudes to replace them. Even at the end, trying to make a new start, his self-delusion is breathtaking. Harold Frederic had the misfortune to die at 42, just as he was starting to hit his stride as a novelist. Had he lived to write even another 10 years, he might be a household name today."
3,Well written but...,Rather drawn out. I definitely wasn't a page turner but I can see the importance in its time period with the secularization of the American intellectual sphere.
3,Ok...not great....,"This is a good album but there is nothing special here at all. If you wanted more of ""February Son"" you won't find much of it here. The changing melodies found throughout ""February Son"" are not found on this album, just hard rock. Which, while good, doesn't do justice to the bands talent."
5,Good Stuff,These guys have really outdone themselves. This disc is chock full of stellar rock vocals and the instrumentation is simply impeccable.
4,under the influence...,"musical influence that is...whether intentional or not it seems as if all their musical influences are present here. each track reminds me of another band. i hear lots of stone temple pilots, alice in chains, third eye blind, incubus, lit and of course nirvana which seems to be their biggest influence on all their releases. this is not really a bad thing, but it seems as if they sound like everyone but themselves. still, joyride is a good third effort and i do respect the fact that they went for a heavier sound. i really really dig on unwind, so maybe i just need to give this one time to sink in."
5,Best rock CD of 2003 so far,Oleander has struck gold with the release of this CD. Very talented bunch of muscians that put out a great CD. All of the songs are memorable with great hooks and lyrics. These guys blow away most of the so-called pop bands out there.
3,what the??,"Does anyone else think this album was recorded in a garage with a bad echo. The sound mix stinks, but these guys are talented and the music is well thought out. Such a shame."
5,Awe inspiring,"while on the surface it sounds like a slight departure from earlier works, this album is honest to ""essence"" that is the most under-appreciated bands in rock! A good mix of acustic ballads, and guitar heavy uptempos. Even casual listeners will be awed by ""Runaway Train,"" ""Rainy Day,"" and the unique sound and lyrics of ""Fountain and Vine"""
1,very little information,"very little information, watches like a info mercial for lorancesum of information: use a live pinfish carolina rigged with a circle hook in about 40ft of water, and enough weight to get to the bottomterrible video, I just paid to watch a commercial"
1,A poor piece of Jewlery,"The knots are uneven - and the string is very stiff. The bracelet does not hang evenly and does not look good at all. Perhaps I expected too much for a n inexpensive necklace, but I would have been better off buying fake pearls for the same price and would have gotten a bracelet that looks 10 times better."
4,Like it,Started reading Xmas could not put it down. The best one I have read yet. Can't wait to read the next one.
3,Juicing,This book shows what to use for each ailment. I was getting a little confused on which I wanted to try first - good book to have around.
1,"Power Juices, Super Drinks","Nothing at all what I had expected, hard to follow, wasn't pleased with it, and I sent it back"
3,Lots to Learn,"Learned some very important tips about cleaning my fruits and vegetables, but I have so much fun just putting things together as I feel like that I haven't used it for prevent and reverse yet."
1,Not So Great,I was only able to view a brief insert of the book online and wasn't able to get the full prospective until it arrived. It wasn't the simple vegetable/fruit recipe book I was looking for.
2,"Cute book, not very helpful","The folksy advice and complicated concoctions in this book seem to be more fantasy than reality. They call for more ingredients than you'd find in any grocery store, and in order to make these juicy refreshments, you have to have a wide variety of juices on hand. Not to mention a dozen appliances for blending, chopping, squeezing and processing the ingredients they way the book describes.I was hoping for something that said ""juice 2 apples, a stalk of celery and a bannana."" But this book says something like, ""blend 1.5 oz. apple juice, 3/4 oz. of celery juice, and 3/4 oz of banana juice."" It doesn't suggest how much of each fruit you need on hand to make the desired amount. It doesn't even focus on Juicing, which is why I bought it.Looks cute on the bookshelf, and that's where it will stay. UN-USED."
5,Super Health Book,"This book has great information about all sorts of common health problems such as memory loss, asthma, depression, enlarged prosate and cancer. The cures recommended are all by using nature's own liquid healers. With hundreds of quick and delicious recipes it makes sickness almost a blessing. The book is very well organized and easy to read."
5,Power Juices and super drinks,This book is everything you need to know about juicing and what your body needs to be fully nourished. I absolutely love this book. I have orderd it for someone else too. Its a must have!!!!! If your into health then this is the book for you!!!!
3,not what I expected,too much of the stuff needed is not easy to find where I live...not much fun...good if you live in someplace like CA
3,Not what I expected,"Overall it's an okay book, but not quite what I expected. The recipes require not only a juicer, but a blender as well, and more time than I think most people are willing to give.The author also recommends using only organic produce and distilling or purifying your own water. Where does this guy live, and on what budget? Produce is expensive enough, let alone organic vegetables -- 99 cents for a regular cucumber or $3.00 for an organic one. Which would you rather buy for a juicer?I think the author's recommendations are idealistic, unrealistic, and not for people who don't have an unlimited budget and tons of time on their hands.There are plenty of other books out there. I wouldn't get this one again."
5,So glad we got it!,It is a wonderful book. Full of excellent information relating to good health and nutrition. Book consists of a lot more than just juice recipes - nutritional information and recommendations.
5,big enough for toddlers,"most hooded towels are thin and small, not really soaking up much water or keeping the kids warm. These towels are thick and still big enough for my 3T daughter."
3,"Fit ok, but missing screws","This replacement drain fit fine, but I ordered the part WITH the screws on purpose. The package came without screws."
1,Much ado about nothing,"Isn't the Harry Potter a book series for children? Isn't it a fantasy series? It's just harmless fun, so leave it alone. Once again a puritanical conservative decides what's best for others and is upset because some people enjoy something he doesn't. Let it go already."
2,They don't stay on the fridge,"I really like the look of these, but the ball is a lot larger then I expected and the magnet is really small in relation to the size of the ball. They are always getting knocked off the fridge."
1,Where's the hooks?,"I tried to like the new Ataris sound, but I can not listen to something with no hooks. There are no songs that made me hit replay or think ""That was a great tune"". I know bands have to evolve, but this far to much. I kept thinking that I was listening to Dishwalla instead of a great punk band. Rest in peace Ataris."
1,boring,"not gonna lie, i was never a huge ataris fan but i still dug their sound. this new album doesnt seem to have any character. the whole cd just sounds like one monotone track, it all blends together and puts me to sleep"
5,thats how a band should sound after all these years,the cd is pure awesomeness.all of it.i mean the guys who put 1 star to this CLASSIC i dont know what they were thinking.Im sure that if they hear that cd after 10 years they ll be amazed of how futuristic is the cd.i suggest to all ataris fans to get the b-sides of this cd too.they re awesome too.dont get fooled this IS a must-have cd
2,Won't live through the night,"I really hate to bash this since I've been a big fan over the years. I realize that you can't do the same thing forever, but you can't do this either. The fact that one lyric which repeats over and over requires the word ""terrible"" to be pronounced wrong in order to rhyme tells you everything you need to know. It's ambitious, and they were a great band so we owed them a listen, but this thing is really dead on arrival. If you really really liked them and want them not to give up completely you can give this two stars."
2,Definitely different...,"Thats about the best thing I can say about it. I love the Ataris, and truly believed that So Long Astoria was a huge step forward for the band. The songs and melodies were still pop oriented, but the lyrical content had obviously matured in depth. There are songs on SLA that actually make me want to cry - songs like ""Unopened Letter to the World"" are beautifully real, something I can identify with and be proud of. And then theres this... and the band is obviously going for a darker sound, but it seems they got lost along the way. Its like an album by a different band completely. Maybe that means Im not 'hardcore' because I dont believe in every single thing they release, but Im not going to sacrifice my feelings and opinions to belong to a certain group of fans. I really do hope Kris Roe (whos a great guy) reads this and understands what Im saying - You can evolve and make a new record without losing the heart, soul, and spirit of your band. Better luck next time."
4,Not capable of understanding the haters,"Hey I really like the Ataris new album. Yes, it is different then their previous stuff and it is a bit iffy that they didn't change their name but good music is good music regardless. I mean if you find someone who doesn't know the Ataris and have them listen to this album, then have them listen to ""So Long, Astoria"" (which is their best effort IMO) they would have no clue that it was the same band. But ""Not Capable of Love"" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time and the rest of the songs don't disappoint at all. Hey if you don't like the new sound then don't buy the album but I don't understand how anyone could really listen to it and not think it's great."
1,dissapointing,"Being an Ataris fan since the beginning, I was excited about their new album. I bought the last, and did not like their new sound but I hoped perhaps they would return to their roots with this album. I was wrong. No longer are they punk but alternative rock- completely different sound than the band I loved. I gave so long Astoria to my little sister as I will this one. I should have done a little more research but for anyone reading this and who liked the old, punk Ataris- this is not them. If you like the popular ""Alternative"" sound than this may be for you. I am just very dissapointed that I will never hear old Ataris sound that I liked again.."
4,Buonissimo! Facile.,"Pretty nice book, but the voabulary is scattered throughout rather than posted in the back.The everyday situations are helpful, and the use of the vernacular is very realistic."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a huge Madonna fan, but this disc was a disappointment. The single version is barely different from the album version and the extended version is basically the single version repeated (MORE or less). If you have I'm Breathless and are not a Madonna fanatic, don't bother with this disc."
1,Avoid until a LEGITIMATE version is released......,"Definitely mastered from either a VHS or a LaserDisc, a blurry, smeary picture along with an extremely hissy soundtrack at raised volumes (the same with the CD enclosed in some issues) does not a pleasant viewing experience make......P.S. There is also a version called ""Soul Session"" on the cheapo Hudson Street label, BEWARE!!!"
1,A cult of Fakery,"This book is one of those that does more harm then well...Extremely shoddy research and some stuff completley made up.There is no historical evidence of sacral kingship in britain.this book is truely about a man who wanted to start his own heathen cult.if one followed much of ""Garman Lords"" methodology one could probably say that the Ancient tribes of Northern Europe believed just about anything.He makes a strong case of 2 + 2 = whatever fits into your ideas."
4,The Sacral Kingship of the Theodish Belief,"""I hereby swear that, while I live, I shall never raise voice, hand or weapon against the Sacral Kingship of the Theodish Belief, excepting it be in self-defense, nor ever aid or abet any other who does so. And moreover that I hereby bend my life to rightful deeds with a Right Good Will, in Wisdom, Generosity and Personal Honor."" -- This is the oath of the Theodsman - The followers of Theodism, the religious practice of the pre-Christian Anglo-Teutonic tribal folk. Recognizing the Gods, Woden, Thunor, Tiw, Frea, Heimdallar, and others of this vein.Greater Theodism is, perhaps, a more structured following of the Old Gods, than say Asatru. It maintains a more tribal faith. In addition we see the concept of The Sacral Kingship in Theodism - connecting men directly to the Gods. Along with a discussion of the Gods, a detailed glossary, and a suggested bibliography - This book is certainly well worth reading."
4,We got to put our heads together,"""We're All in the Same Gang"" was an anti-gang violence rap song. It featured a plethora of ""West Coast Rap All-Stars"". The performers are Ice-T, Tone Loc, M.C. Hammer, N.W.A., Young M.C., Above The Law, Digital Underground, King Tee, Body & Soul, Oaktown's 3.5.7, Michel'le, Def Jef, Eazy-E and J.J. Fad. It's actually a pretty good song. The CD features the full length version and a radio edit. It also features one other anti-gang violence rap by Mike Concepcion. Here is the track listing:1. We're All in the Same Gang (Radio Special)2. We're All in the Same Gang (full length version)3. Tellin' Time (Mike's Rap)"
3,"Not much love for ""Love & Energy""","This disc is mediocre. The best part of it, and why a gave it 3 stars instead of 1, is the song ""Energy"" and the remixes of it. The standout is the DJ X remix. Tracks 2,3,4, & 8 are also pretty good. Track 5 has the background beat of ""Take My Love"" with new lyrics that aren't nearly as good as it. Tracks 6,7,& 10 are like R&B trax that don't even belong on here. Track 9 is one of the worst songs that I have ever heard! If you can find ""Energy"" somewhere else than get it, but I would skip this disc. Also, if you are from my area check out DJ Kid Prophet's CD ""Triple Stack"" which includes an awesome remix of ""Fantasy"". If you liked my review, then don't forget to vote."
3,small and great for a costume,"I got this wings so that I could dress as a pink flamingo for a friends party (it was an Alice in Wonderland theme). I first thought they were on the small side (perhaps for a kid) but they worked well on my 5ft 4inch frame and didn't bang into every darn thing. They are constructed of cardboard and pink feathers (which will shed) and have difficulty keeping a great shape. However, if you only need them for a costume then I say go ahead and purchase. The straps stayed on, I got plenty of compliments, and they are perfect for a my flamingo costume. Totally worth the money I spent."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I thought this would be more of a travel book, but instead, it is a series of essays mostly of people Chatwin found interesting. For this reader, many of the essays were boring -- the subject matter or the person being written about was often too obscure or exotic. Out of loyalty to the author, I forced myself to read them, but, as the book went on, I began worrying more about my loyalty to me, the reader. I started skipping over some of the essays and ultimately, couldn't wait till the book ended. I usually like books like this, but this one only made me drowsy."
3,Too much about people and not enough about travel,"Chatwin's stories of Africa, Nepal and Afghanistan of the 1980s were all very riveting, but there were many more essays about his obscure friends I had no interest in. I especially liked his write-up of the civil war he experienced in a small African country. But because this book was mostly a profile of his friends, I only give it three instead of four stars."
2,Content really disappointing,"I felt this book had very limited content as to what it portrayed in its description. There were several projects that were repeated and many were not what I consider practical. I was hoping for a book that would have a wider variety of useful/ neat items. This book fell far short of this expectation.The book's organization is confusing. There is no categorization of the projects.I would not have bought this book if I knew it would be this disappointing. Sorry, but I am very dissatisfied with this book."
4,to b or nto 2 b connected,"this item arrived on time, it does what it says it does and even make it very simple with the color coded for each connector."
5,I would rate it 6 stars if I could,"This is the most beautiful book I have ever seen. Having purchased the complete Little Nemo book series in the 1980's I really looked forward to finally being able to see this lovely comic in its original format. When the book arrived today I realised that it was even better than I had hoped for, extremely high quality and of impressive size.The only drawback is that it does only contain a selection of the story, but I can always read the missing pages in the cheaper old edition. A big applaud for the publisher who dared produce this wonderfull piece of art."
3,Opened Many Doors,"I am not a big fan of pop bachata, but you cannot deny the importance of this production. This recording opened doors for other young bachateros such as Xtreme and Toby Love to rise to fame. The c.d. contains a lot of nice songs including the popular single ""Cuando Volveras."" One particularly powerful song is ""No Lo Perdona Dios"" which talks about the controversial topic of abortion. The rest of the songs are catchy and have good rythms. The smooth and silky voice of lead singer Anthony Santos really compliment the songs. This production was one of the most important of it's time because it marketed bachata to a younger audience and made bachata a commercial success."
3,"Buena bachata, pero el merengue-bachata no muy bueno","Hablar malo de Aventura es un poco dificil considerando tanto que han hecho por la bachata. Si has oido los CDs mas nuevos de ellos entenderas que tienen una seguridad y sentimiento increible. En este CD son mas jovenes, y la musica se siente mas conservativa. No es tan dinamica, moderna, y no toman tantos riesgos.Eso si, Cuando Volveras es una de las mejores canciones de bachata, que se convertira en una classica. Pero la adicion del merengue bachateao fue una mala idea en mi opinion porque los muchachos simplemente no tienen el genio y/o la experiencia de Juan Luis Guerra para poder tocar en los dos generos."
3,Exchange issues,First off the product I got is labeled different but from what I can tell the same exact stuff. I had a lot of trouble getting a clean exchange of gas between the nozzle and the magazine port. There is too much play in the nozzle and something going on with the mixture which allows for a significant loss during exchange. Still worth it though since I got as of of play from each bottle. However if I had lost less gas during my reloads I would have been much happier! Decent at best in my opinion.
4,The item performed as expected.,"As stated in my review's title, the 1000 mL green gas worked as expected in my climate (central Texas) and therefore merits a five-star rating. Shipping was conducted in a timely manner. I recieved two cans of gas labled ""All-purpose Air Duster."" After removing the stick-on layer, I was greeted with a white and green ULTRAIR power gas logo. The canister had all needed safety information, most of it common sense. I was satisfied with my purchase and was able to use it with my WE High-capa 5.1 Silver Dragon."
4,Just gassy,I guess this stuff works ok. I had a Y&P MK23 and got about 15 shots from each mag fill. I'm not sure if green gas is supposed to be more efficient than that but it seemed ok. I actually sold my pistol and this green gas.
2,Ran out to fast,I didn't get the same bottle that was on the picture and there is no way of re-sealing it rendering it useless after one day.I usually don't do bad reviews but I was compelled to write this one.
2,Way too expensive.,"I bought this green gas which costs about $30 including shipping which is crazy expensive. Another downside of this product is that it is only 8oz which does not last very long. Some online retailers will sell 24oz cans for about $8. Thus I can purchase about 4 cans with 4x the gas in it for the same price. Aside from the amount and the price, the gas performs well and has a nice fresh smell added to it."
2,Cheap,"This gas is VERY cheap gas. It is not green gas. When you get the item take off the papers and everything. You will find a different company logo than the one pictured. [...]Also, this Airsplat green gas doesn't lubricate the gun."
1,THIS IS NOT GREEN GAS,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GREEN GAS.First off, the product I received does NOT look what the picture shows. The bottle appears to have a wrap around paper label covering whatever it is.Second, the bottle says compressed air. NO WHERE ON THE BOTTLE DOES IT EXPLICITLY SAY THAT IT CONTAINS PROPANE. GREEN GAS IS PROPANE. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONTAIN PROPANE.I AM *VERY* DISAPPOINTED. IN 10 YEARS OF AMAZON PATRONAGE, THIS IS MY FIRST NEGATIVE PURCHASE."
2,the nozzle wasn't long enough for the riffle we wanted to fill,we couldn't figure out why the green gas wasn't filling up our riffle...the nozzle wasn't long enough...frustrating!!! now we need to buy an extention
4,Green gas is green gas,All green gas seems to come from the same place with different outside labels. It's generic and this is more of the same. Great service from the vendor.
3,does not fit every gun,I bought this thinking it would fit my we 1911 mag but it does not. The needle is not long enough and the worst part is they both came from airsplat. I will no longer be buying from them. This is ridiculous
3,Not terribly impressed by selections,"One of the most difficult things about teaching ancient history is either the lack of textbooks for students or the lack of really good textbooks. For a long time, Nagle's survey books were the only ones available. This is not true for the ""readings"" book that is written to accompany his survey book. Overall the selections are rather haphazard -- they are organized both thematically and chronologically but not culturally or geographical. Some of the entries are great but many are far too brief to be of real use to students. There are many ""source"" books for ancient history but they all have this same problem. Ultimately I suspect that most instructors will spend time creating course packets than relying on these source books."
2,Drink chunks,"I'm a hard gainer and I haven't gained a pound since starting to use this product over 2 weeks ago. Taste is ok, but powder doesn't mix well at all. Practically have to chew the shake before I can swallow it!"
1,THE GREAT ROXHYTHE by Georgette Heyer,"If you're expecting one of Heyer's usual light-hearted regencies, you'll be extremely disappointed in THE GREAT ROXHYTHE. In fact, I would recommend you skip this one entirely. I found it as dull as ditch water and the characters one-dimensional; definitely not up to the author's usual standards. However, if you've read and enjoyed any of Heyer's other historical novels (ROYAL ESCAPE, THE CONQUEROR, MY LORD JOHN, and SIMON THE COLDHEART), you'll probably enjoy this one too."
5,Georgette Hayer and The Great Roxhythe,Georgette Heyer did not like The Great Roxhythe herself but her father thought it was one of her best works - I agree with her father. This is a very engaging book set during the reign of Charles II. While Roxhythe is a fictional character he moves in a thoroughly researched setting during this reign. It is what I call a 'meaty' book that is quite distinct from the author's lighter novels.Second hand copies are selling as high as $200.00 so purchasing a new copy at just over $20.00 plus postage from Amazon is an excellent way to go. I recommend this book. I've read this book from my library and am looking forward to receiving my own copy from Amazon.
4,Mayan Mystery,"A lesbian grieving her dead lover returns to Mexico and becomes embroiled in the Mayan ""Baktun"" myth of 2011. This story has some complicated concepts including comets and Mayan cosmology, but overall is well written and extremely informative.If you've ever been to a Mayan city, Conrad's writing transports you back into that stunning but mysterious world. I loved getting into the ancient Mayan mythology and enjoyed this book."
1,Too heavy to hold!,"This used to be a great (and medium-sized) magazine with at least one great article in every issue. Last year the format was changed & the darned thing is so big I can't read it in bed. At last look they still had at least one interesting article, but it is surrounded by page after page of mind-numbing glossy ads, with more pages of pictures of the SF social set.I can't imagine what this costs to mail out; believe me, it is no longer worth the postage."
3,Misleading advertising,"The hype for this product is grossly overexaggerated. The string of pears do not hang smoothly, the box is a disgrace to use as a gift,the packing to show off a necklace supposedly worth $160. As well as misrepresenting the credit card application, to be applied to the price. That is a joke!! Card seems to be approved for future purchases. I THINK NOT!! I am unable to speak with an agent, because no agent is available. WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE PHONE AGENTS available."
1,Disappointed,"We purchased this item for our daughter, mainly because of a glowing review about the presentation box and the exceptional quality of the pearls. When the necklace arrived, we felt it looked like something from a ""dime store"" and was in a plain box, not a hinged box as the ad seems to convey. We're returning the item for a refund."
1,Save your money.,"I don't know how anyone could give this necklace a good review..""Dime store"" is not even the word for how cheap looking these are.Can't even get them to hang straight because the string is too tight.The ""delicate clasp"" is more like the stuff you get out a gumball machine."
1,Pearls,"Smaller than I thoughtbunched together,bought for the wife but they were so cheezy decided to give them to my daughter instead and then went and bought the wife a set of pearls that actually looked nice,"
1,Waste of money,Such a waste of money. Small pearls and unattractive. Over exaggerated description. You can tell from the appearance that this thing does not worth more than $40 buck
4,Not Far from the Tree,"Although his daughter Roseanne will forever reside 'neath the shadow of her illustrious Dad, she now has accumulated a catalog as long and impressive as virtually anyone in country/pop music today, save perhaps him. Like her father's, Roseanne's songs carry with them a power derived from their simplicity. And like her father, she has been blessed at this stage of her career with a most simpatico producer, her husband John Leventhal. Together they present here a no-frills batch of reflective, insightful, just-plain-pretty songs colored by Cash's conversational singing and the understated musical arrangements. The highlight, a touching duet between father and daughter. Bring tissues."
2,Unintelligible,"Having bought every one of Ms. Cash's recordings, regret doing so here. Introspective musings meaningless without an external frame of reference as played on a real hi-fi, thought car stereo merely muffled the lyrics but they seem neurotic. INTERIORS gone off the tracks. To the extent that lyrics can be deduced, one track appears to be about drug abuse cathartic power, another about incest or maybe pedophilia. A long-time truly fine artist has made a comeback after when she should have retired; CDs are no place to work out inner demons illogically. Even the backing band had to stretch the circle of fifths beyond tunefulness. Not accessible to these ears, and I hate having to provide this analysis."
5,Just like falling into the arms of a long lost friend/lover.,You miss someone so bad and all you have are some old memories of that person and you have been aching to see them again. Then you hear that they are back in town and you wonder if they have changed and in what kind of way. You just can't wait for them to drop on by. Then after all the waiting you realize that the reason why you missed them so much is not because of what they might be like now but how you remember them from the past. Then you get to see them again and the reunion is greater than you expected and you know that what you were aching for has finally come back to you.That is how I feel about Rosanne's music and her new release.
3,not-fully-satisfying yet still welcome offering,"glad she's back -- this CD is nice and would be considered great for many less accomplished artists. Difficult for any truly amazing artist (which she is) to top the immensely powerful and emotionally satisfying tryptich/trilogy of: INTERIORS, THE WHEEL, & 10-SONG DEMO. If you don't have those...you're missing her best work.Face it -- contentment doesn't usually make for great art -- yet I can't help but be glad she's had some time for grounding and happiness in her life for a while now and still been able to produce a lovely, if not soul-satisfying set of work.And unfortunately, I would guess that we'll see/hear a return to more soulfulness and depth after the terrible dual losses of her father (Johnny) and step-mom (June Carter-Cash) this very year.Even with this less satisfying work, Rosanne Cash is one our greatest artists all in her own right."
2,Big disappointment from a major talent,"Roseanne Cash long ago proved herself one of the finest singer-songwriters in any musical genre. Despite a couple of good cuts, however, ""Rules of Travel"" is little more than an echo of such stunning earlier albums as ""King's Record Shop,"" ""Interiors,"" and ""The Wheel."" John Leventhal's production may be too glossy at times, but it's often the only element that keeps you listening to the new songs at all. The numbers written by others are mostly formulaic, and Cash's own compositions lack the biting insights into the politics of relationships and making peace with one's past that have always sparked her best writing. The mild exceptions are the title track, which boasts a memorable chorus, and the lover's challenge ""Closer Than I Appear."" On the plus side, Cash is in fine voice -- maybe her finest ever. Let's hope that the next album finds her back in top writing form as well."
5,Great CD,Rosanne Cash's new CD is worth the money and then some. Her songwriting and singing are fantastic. Her voice is powerful from start to finish. It's really great to hear her duet with her dad Johnny Cash. Her music like her father's is tough to label or put in one category. I would say buy it if you like anything Rosanne Cash has done before. Must have!
4,Rosanne is cooler than her cohort,"I saw her perform most of these songs on Austin City Limits. I must admit I hadn't paid much attention to her since her debut album, back when I was playing in country bands.Much of this material is kinda introspective, but hey, on the plus side you get great vocals, well crafted songs, tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who doesn't have to pretend she is anything she isn't. And these days, that is pretty refreshing!I think I am becoming a fan."
3,Not the version to read,"This is not the version to read. Read the 1933 revision: How we Think: A restatement of the relation of reflective thinking to the educative process. It is much more complete, and this is NOT that version--you really have to search for it."
1,This is a Bootleg Edition,"This is not the same edition as the one that can be viewed on this page. There is a disclaimer in the front of the book that states that the so-called publisher ""recreated this book from the original using Optical Character Recognition software..."" Their software was defective. The results are unreadable gibberish. Information from the library they stole it from is integrated into the main body of text on the last page.I am returning this to Amazon and looking for a legitimate copy of How We Think."
1,Great Book; BAD Edition,"I've never panned an item for an Amazon review. But this specific edition of Dewey's ""How We Think"" should not be sold. Adapted from a POORLY EDITED online text, it is a bad text for reading and practically useless for scholarly documentation. Look for a better edition."
1,Printing errors in 'How We Think',"I discovered systematic printing errors in the text, as if the book had been printed from the wrong file. Text was missing, lines were truncated, strange symbols appeared in the text. This wasn't just a nuisance, but prevented understanding, so I decided to return the book unread."
1,Unreadable. Buy a different copy.,"This book is completely different than the preview version and the OCR text is unreadable. Dewey is good reading, so buy from a different publisher."
2,Expensive bulbs don't last,I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.
1,Insects in Noodle Package,I bought a couple of six packs of these noodles along with some of their other noodles.I kept them for some time and discovered insects in a pakage when I opened it the other day .This was a sealed box with a sealed plastic package inside so the insects had to come from the factory .I can only assume there are unsanitary conditions in their factory.I contacted the company but received on reply .I am disposing of the products and would never buy products form this company .
2,Misguided,"I picked up this book hoping it would demonstrate ways to teach math in a new way - a way different from the way I was taught when I was young. Something different from the old ""memorize this algorithm, then drill and practice."" This book doesn't quite get there. Granted, Romagnano's ways are a bit different and probably marginally better than the old ways of teaching math. But I think essentially, all he is doing is working word problems as a class and spoonfeeding students the solutions step-by-step. At least the author was kind of enough to give transcripts of portions of his class so you can see that his students are still not getting it. If you are looking for books that demonstrate ways to teach so students will think and learn about MATHEMATICS, and not just memorize procedures and algorithms, I suggest other books, like ""The Teaching Gap,"" or ""Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics"""
3,Leo's room is a room for everybody,"It is one of the calm and relaxing movies you can watch on a lazy afternoon. Leo is a student who comes to terms with his sexuality. But it is not only him who we meet in his room. There is his school friend, Caro, in deep depression after an accident (one of the best plots in this film). There is his flat-mate, living in front of telly. There are gays who he meets thanks to online chat rooms.Beside Leo's room, there is also a room of therapist where Leo slowly tries to understand what is going on with him.The main character is likeable, although his shyness and being wishy-washy may irritate some of the viewers.Among so many bad gay-theme movies, this one is really nice done."
5,Life orf an artist,"Great book, a biography for the ages, escpecially if you are a Hollywood/movies buff. He will tell you, as honestly as you can imagine, his struggles for survival, his revealing of ""names"" during the HUAC investigations, and the reasons behind all this this. Plus, if you like his movies, you have a first rate writer and critic of his own works, and their history. You will hear about the tragedies of his own life,and the devastating results of his inner conflicts. Don't delay buying it. It is the history of cinema for several generations, a great life story. Yes, Kazan may not have been a good novelist--he tried the genre--but a great writer of nis life non-the-less. And a good historian to boot. Worth the price of admission."
3,Fun ...But Not Much To It.,"My daughter loves any type of magnet game, and this was very cute in person. However, it only comes with a couple of outfits for Ariel (less for Eric) and she gets tired of it quickly. The small magnets really do nothing and very small cover surface (the tin can it comes in) to really play with it. Not sure it was worth the money."
3,Not for the young ones,I got this for my 3 1/2 year old. Her two year old brother got a hold of it one time and half the pieces are gone forever!
1,Kevin Moore needs to move back to the U.S.,"This is Kevin Moore's second release (the first being Ghost Book) for the otherwise highly impressive Inside Out label. Both were recorded in Istanbul, Turkey, where Moore now resides and both are equally devoid of music. If you are a fan of Chroma Key's first two albums and Moore's work with OSI, you will most likely not enjoy this album. ""Graveyard Mountain Home"" is basically a 53-minute series of loops where Moore either drones incoherently or plays sparse instrumentation. Some may describe the melodic content as subtle but, in my opinion, it is completely absent. If you are seeking another ""Undertow"" or ""On The Page,"" look elsewhere. Utterly disappointing."
4,critical contemporary electronic release of 2004,"creative and expressive musical compositions of various forms predominately electronic but also incorporating interesting and subtle use of acoustic and non-synth sounds and beats. like a mix of bonobo, her space holiday, devics, squarepusher, and all such artists in a soundtrack tapestry. at times the mood is abrupt in between pieces that seem a bit sudden and whimsical. yet they all seem to be of the same family. i only wish there were more of Kevin Moore's clever and solemn lyric and voice as it gives the music that added dimension.notice i didn't mention crap like Fates Warning, OSI and Dream Theater above - no relation at all. good."
1,Dull with no stamina,Would not buy this product. Even on sunny days the lights will only last a few hours in the evening and are not very bright.I bought Portfolio brand lights which are much better.
4,Nice tree,"This tree was much heavier and bulkier than I expected... it is nice and full and the lights are nicely wrapped and spaced. Good shape to the tree... lots of tips.However the ""reusable carton"" is garbage. It came to me dented in and then proceeded to rip beyond repair while we tried to take the tree out. I ended up buying TWO large plastic tree storage cases to accommodate the bulk of this tree.... storage is a problem.But all in all, it is a nice tree.Much better than anything I have seen here locally and the gold box price is VERY good!"
1,Rusty Pressure Cooker,I bought this Presto 01370 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure cooker/Canner from Amazon on May 09 and I received on May 16. Amazon did a good job on delievering.I tried to boil water (just like one of the customer review posted on the Presto 6 Quart Model) once for 15 minutes. The pressure cooker itself was working fine but I noticed that there were many rusty spots formed and it also had brown color stain even though it's supposed to be stainless steel. It scared me off when I touched the rough rusty spots. It seemed like the coat on the bottom of the pot peeled off or scaled off. I've never seen anything scary like this. I wonder if Presto tested this product before selling it to the public?
1,8 qt cooker/canner a sorry excuse,"The 8 qt pressure cooker works at a far lower pressure than the older cookers. This makes it an almost pressure cooker. The higher your altitude, the more useless the product. We live at 6100 ft and need a pressure cooker to cook beans."
4,Cannot do canning in this,"Good for general use for lentils, beets, and potatoes. However, it is too small for pressure canning, which disappointed us. If you have an interest in doing any pressure canning in the future, just buy the bigger capacity one with a readable regulator to save yourself from having two different items."
4,FAVORABLE REVIEW PREST 8QT PRESSURE COOKER,"I've used the pressure cooker many times. Used it within minutes of having received it. I'm used to an electric pot, but this one is a lot bigger and much cheaper. At first, I scorched food because I did not turn the fire up enough and the pc was losing vapor thru the air vent. My fault. It is fast and excellent to use; easy to clean. I highly recommend it."
4,It's good but handle,"My first pressure cooker is presto aluminum 8QT. I like it very much. But after buying a new cooktop, I didn't dare to use aluminum ccookware. So I turn to SS(Stainless Steel) 8QT. I prefer long one hand handle, but presto didn't have SS pressure cooker with one handle. During X'mas, I purchase a ss 6QT as gift to my mother-in-low. She has a 8 QT already, and she always say that's too big for her. She and I really like the ss 6QT, and I plan to buy one when it's on sale. Recently I buy another ss 8qt for my mom. (the pressure cooker I talk about here are all Presto) I know there are many good brand pressure cookers in the market and there are really expensive. I'm not a prefessional cook. I'm a housewife and I cook everyday. For me, Presto is good enough."
1,Exploded,This pressure cooker worked great until the rubber/plastic plug in the lid exploded out of it last night. Now I have to consider this to be an unsafe product.
4,NOT for use in CANNING,"According to Presto, this 8-qt. cooker is NOT suitable for canning, because the last time testing was done for canning times in this size cooker was 30 years ago, and changes in scientific knowledge and in the types/acidity, etc., of vegetables make those times out-of-date and unsuitable for safe canning.So . . . this is NOT a canner. Presto says the smallest canner they sell now is the 16-qt."
1,Be CAREFUL!,"I have had this pressure cooker for 7 months and it's worked well up until tonight. I begain making soup in the pressure cooker and, as usual, the pressure built up and started to whistle, so I turned down the heat and let it cook. After a few minutes, the pressure stopped but I thought it was just that the heat was too low, so I turned it back up but nothing happened until the stopper valve blow off and I had soup everywhere!!! It scared us to death!!Needless to say, I spent the next hour cleaning soup off my ceiling, light fixtures, counter tops! It appears that the pressure release gauage didn't activate. I'm very dissapointed with this product and I'm now too scared to use it again! I've written the company to see if they will replace it, we'll see....."
2,"At altitutudes about 3,000 feet","Just got the pressure cooker, and it looks like a great, heavy duty pot. Very nice. Because of the other reviews, my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning.However, after reading the manual, I learned that this CAN NOT be used for canning at altitudes above 3,000 feet -- which leaves out a lot of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah......Otherwise, I'm sure it's great.Update: A lot of comments to this post -- I need to clarify. You can use it to COOK (adjust cooking times for altitude), but not to CAN. Two different functions. Talk to your science teacher -- the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature the water reaches its boiling point, and therefore, the less pressure. To get to the appropriate temperature to kill bacteria for safe canning, you need higher PRESSURE at altitude. This does not reach high enough pounds of pressure at altitude.Cooking food at altitude -- good. Canning food at altitude -- poison."
5,8 quart,"OMG best baby back ribs ever!I have never used a pressure cooker before until today. My ribs have always been good but not great until now. I put 3 racks of ribs into my 8 quart cooker without the included rack and cooked them for only 17 minutes with 18 oz. of water then put them in the broiler with my favorite BB sauce on high for 7 minutes per side and got the best ribs ever.Don't boil, steam, smoke your ribs pressure cook them then either BBQ or broil them for the best ribs ever. Trust me."
4,Making meal time faster...,"I am happy with this purchase. This pressure cooker does the job and is extremely easy to use, (although I'd prefer the type with an adjustable pressure gauge), the quality stainless steel and low price are a super bonus. The convenience of online shopping, quality products and fast/easy shipping fit well into my busy life. Thank you!"
5,"Nice product, fast delivery",I love this pressure cooker! It is durable and has many safety features. Presto brand growing up was like Kleenex.The product arrived very quickly and in great condition.
4,I like it,"The size is good although it is taller than wider (would prefer it the other way around); it is not too heavy so it is easy to handle, but I do not understand why food gets burnt on the bottom. I have an old pressure cooker made from aluminum, and I never had a problem with burning food using exactly the same method (I bought this cooker as a replacement)."
3,PRESTO SHASZAM!,"THE GOOD - IT'S STAINLESS STEEL, AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL.THE BAD - THE ""TRIVET"" IS USELESS, AND NOT STAINLESS ( RUSTS, AND LEAVES RUST SPOTS ON COOKER ), AND DOES NOT ALLOW ADEQUATE SPACE FOR THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF WATER TO PROPERLY STEAM FOOD.SUGGESTION - PROVIDE A STEAMER BASKET THAT EXTENDS TO THE TOP INTERIOR OF THE COOKER, SO FOOD DOES NOT CONTACT THE COOKER SIDE WALL AND SCORCH.ALL OF THE ABOVE DID NOT DISSUADE ME FROM BUYING A SECOND LIKE COOKER FOR MY NIECE, RANDO"
3,Awesome,Pretty good. Product works and cooks the meat as I would expect. Nice & tender. It was very affordable & arrived within the time frame given.
3,Didn't like enough to keep,Too noisy when cooking. It also generated too much heat in my kitchen. I will go with the much quieter electric pressure cooker instead of this on the stove version.
5,Great cooker,This is a great cooker. Most pressure cookers are aluminum and I hate cooking in aluminum. This one is well made in the Presto tradition. Good buy
5,Just what I needed,I have been wanting a larger pressure cooker in SS for many years. This one is so simple to use and release the pressure; my Grandmother used this brand. The locking top is safe and I have no guesses about if it is secure when cooking. I should get a book to expand my knowledge about how to use it better.
2,Not made in the USA!,"This review is more about Presto, the company, rather than how this product performs, as I haven't actually used it yet. I have wanted a pressure cooker for a while, and have been researching them quite extensively. It is important to me to buy US made products whenever possible. I visited the Presto website, and by reading about the company, was led to believe that all presto products are made in on of their 3 US manufacturing locations. I was sold. My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and I was so excited to finally have one. Once I removed it from the box, I flipped it over to look for the ""made in the usa"" stamp, and imagine my disgust to see it stamped, ""made in china"". Boy that really ticks me off! I'm tempted to return the darn thing. I feel that Presto intentionally deceives the general public by only talking about their US manufacturing plants and never stating anywhere on their website that their products are made in China. Shame on you Presto!"
3,I BROUGHT THIS PRESSURE COOKER AND USING IT ALMOST EVERY WEEK,IT JUST OK FOR THE PRICE BUT NOT THAT GOOD LIKE (ALL AMERICAN PRESSURE COOK) PLUS IT IS REALLY STRICKY TO OPEN AND CLOSING THE LID.
1,no jiggler,"I had a wonderful pressure cooker. Nothing was wrong with it, it was just old, but I replaced it with this model and I can't for the life of me cook a decent meal in it. I was used to the rhythmic shush-shush-shushing of the jiggler on top that my old one had- told me when to turn it down/up... start my timer. This one doesn't shush. I hate it."
1,i returned it!,i bought this to pressure can vegetables only to learn after i got it that they don't recommend canning in this size cooker
1,Too heavy too big,"This High pressure cooker is too heavy too big. I used it only once (bad experience), and now it is sleeping in my cabinet. I would rather buy a nice high pressure cooker from Bed Bath and Beyond."
5,Presto stainless pressure cooker,"Thanks to the reviews on Amazon, I chose the best cooker. High quality, easy to use, great results and time/energy savings. Excellent value."
5,does what it says,"This is a quality item. Has a stainless basket and trivet inside and cooks beautifully. I bought it because I wanted to change from aluminum to stainless cookware, but was cautious about whether it would heat and cook as well as the aluminum. I was very pleased indeed with its performance. The bi-clad base is the key because the aluminum inside the two layers of stainless steel transfers the heat evenly. Using enough water for cooking, avoiding too high heat, and being careful not to run the cooker dry will avoid damage to the base. I am very pleased with this item."
4,Good Pressure cooker,This cooker can't be beat for the price paid and the performance. It would be nice to be able to cook reliably at less than 15 lbs pressure all the time but it still works great. The quality is clearly better than anything in the same price range. We really use it all the time an all sorts of vegetables.
2,It did not work out for me,"I did quite a lot of research and read many reviews before I purchased this pressure cooker. And I have a friend who has this model and she uses her nearly every day. So I was very disappointed in what happened when I used this pressure cooker. I followed all instructions that came with it but I could not get the unit to reach an adequate pressure. I have an electric glass-top range, but that should not interfere with how this cooker worked.I let the pressure cooker heat to a point of excessive steam release (and a lot of noise) before I turned the heat down, but still my recipe was under-cooked. In fact, everything I cooked in it (four different recipes) I had to cook twice in order to get the food done. So, I sent this pressure cooker back for a refund and purchased from Amazon an electric one (different manufacturer)which I absolutely love."
5,Wonderful Product!,"This is a wonderful (and safe) product. It is exactly the right size: not a canning cooker, but large enough to cook a full meal for a family of 4 (or so) but not too heavy, even when fully loaded. The cooker is easy to use and easy to clean. Good job, Presto!"
4,A great product for the money....,"This is my first pressure cooker. The design is far as safety is fool proof. No chance of this item blowing up in your face. You can make soup in fifteen munutes flat. Turns any cut of meat fork tender. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. The only down side is the handles are plastic, and only time will tell in their endurance. All in all, a great product for the money. Highly recommended!"
2,Dumb,The balls don't even move down with enough force to spin the fan or the other objects. It's not like a kladioscope at all. Not worth it.
2,item appeared to be used and repackaged or resold,Item was clearly purchased elsewhere and resold to me as new. I have never had this experience with amazon before and am disappointed. Packaging was dirty and previous price sticker still attached.
3,rainstick,My daughter thinks this is the coolest thing..but it is much bigger than what I thought..which is my fault for not reading close enough. So she is too little to really play with it b/c she can't hold it good and would hit herself in the head with it..I'm afraid when she is big enough that she won't be interested.
3,Great concept but...,"The one we played with before purchase was really cool so I went for it. Unfortunately, this one has so many doodah's along the way that the full ""rain"" effect is never achieved. Once he is a bit older (no danger of getting whacked with it) we will purchase the real thing."
1,Just a Rattle,"I was so disappointed with this toy, in fact, I was extremely disappointed because I bought three. These are just big rattles. There are no interesting sounds except cheap plastic beads rattling around. This did not interest my one year old granddaughter at all. Maybe a younger baby would like it if it was held for him, because it's too big for a baby to hold. A waste of money"
2,Rainstick,I found a much better deal on ebay. It is a new Natural Cactus Rainstick Shaker: 6.5 - 7 inches long. The outside of the rainstick has been gently sanded to remove any splinters. I feel this is a higher quality product to give to my young granddaughter.
3,A little overrated,"I thought this toy would be fun for my children, but they don't show any interest in it. The plastic beads fall really quickly through the rainstick and you really can't see everything that is happening. The beads get stuck throughout the stick too. It's too cheaply made for the price. I wouldn't call the noise ""rain"" either. It just sounds like plastic beads falling through a plastic tube."
3,Stuck flipper...,"When I received this toy, one of the turning flipper things in the bottom of the stick was out of the holder it should sit in so it wouldn't turn. The stick doesn't really work without all of the pieces rotating so it just tends to hold the beads in that end.I think it would be a wonderful toy if it is checked before it is shipped to verify that everything in it rotates as it is supposed to."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This is a comment on the quality of the binding...not the content of the book (which I haven't read). I ordered this as a gift and specifically chose the ""hardbound"" copy instead of the ""paperback"" because it was a gift and I assumed at the price ($63.96) that it would be beautifully bound and keepsake quality. I was nothing less than shocked to receive a small book bound in the manner of children's books. (For those familiar with Nancy Drew books, it's about that size with that type of binding...thin plastic over cardboard and no dust jacket.) I am returning this and ordering the paperback version and using the remaining $50 to buy another gift to go along with it."
1,Horrible Edition,I am returning my copy. This was typeset by a publisher that scanned an original and did OCR. Many pages are completely unreadable. Buy a different edition.
1,Not what I thought it would be- did not understand at all.,"iTS NOT WHAT i EXPECTED! its more like measuring terms, really did not understand.It seems to be a science review."
4,Indian Comfort Food,"I was a little taken aback when I first ate this. The potato dumplings have a texture suspiciously similar to tater-tots. Though surprising, this is not a downside - if anything it improved the overall awesomeness of this sauce concoction. I eat it on brown rice and its tangy salty creaminess reminds me of mac&cheese. It isn't exactly the healthiest thing you could eat, but it is really satisfying. I would recommend eating it on something else, however. It is a little overpowering (though not very spicy) on its own."
4,Pretty Good supplement,By itself the flavor is too strong and overwhelming after a few bites. I used as an additive with other stuff mixed in for my pasta. The buttermilk cream base lends itself very good as an additive.
1,Really bad...unless you like a lot of grease & overly hot,"Sounded good by some reviews and description. Ordered a case. Opened one can and tried to eat. I couldn't eat it. I like really spicy food and I do like rich food. This was very bland, other than the over the top hot spices. I didn't want to throw it away, so I have 11 out of 12 cans stored in my garage which will either go to charity or I sell or give away at my next garage sale...."
1,"""Padded"" history of a political friendship","The professional book review cited by Amazon really says it all about this book. The author's premise - that the Roosevelts and King George VI & Elizabeth had an extra-special relationship - is very overreaching, and padded to the nth degree. I guess that Hugo Vickers (per the Author's introduction) who is supposed to have read it from cover to cover before publishing, didn't notice the flawed research, the melodramatic phrasing, and repetition of hoary old gossip as the truth. I am so glad I only borrowed this from the library and didn't waste my money on a purchase."
3,Not even remotely what I was expecting... I wish there was a 'preview inside this book' option. Might not have bought it.,"This book i something of a total mish-mash. There's a bunch of random stuff at the end that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with HPL. Much of the book doesn't seem to really be graphic-novel or comics-like, but just kind of vague imagery in some small way Lovecraftian.Not my cup of tea... I much prefer the ""Lovecraft"" graphic novel and a few others. ""Poe & Phillips"" is pretty skipable though.Yeah, if you're looking for a graphic novel, I don't think this is it..."
5,Bettina,"At first, I was wondering about the title of the book, but the more I read it, the more I love it! It is a great read and love the recipes. The chapters are wonderful, the characters are very homey."
2,CONFUSED..............,"This disk rack is beautiful when you take it out of the box, but the first use told a different story. The tray has no slanted lip and no holes for drainage....all the water just pooled in the tray. While doing one load of dishes, I had to physically pick the rack up (with all the wet dishes in it) and dump the water out of the tray three times. Definitely not designed by someone who washes alot of dishes!! Pretty but not functional."
1,Didn't work for me,"The tray doesn't drain, it collects the water. Since the utensil basket is part of the tray, couldn't use the drainer without it."
2,bad design,"While it is good to have something in stainless steal, it has a bad design compared to the cheap $10 drainer we had before. Bowls sometimes can fall off from the side. It can't hold enough plates and bowls. Also there is not enough support for plates to stand straight.There are no holes in place to drain water. The spoon holder is towards the end of the slope and always some water accumulates in that area making it dirty after a while."
1,Interdesign lacks good design,"I had to return this. When I bought it, I had no idea that the drip catcher was attached to the drainer...plus it didn't have a hole in it for draining. I use a drainer in my sink to drain dishes so the drip tray feature was useless. Very poor design!"
1,Not as advertised.,"Customer service was awful and rude and trying to fix the problem also. Do not deal with this, not worth it"
1,Returned!,"This was so terrible, I returned it. Don't waste your time or money!!! It's poorly constructed. I ended up with a different brand, and was extremely satisfied!"
5,Funny,Everyone on the movie was funny and was a joy to watch. It is nice to sit back and see where people have grown.
4,"BLACK COMEDY DRAMA ...""Coo-well"" !!",Best comedy drama too date! It teaches entertainment ain't everythang! GET A EDUCATION FIRST! ...Peace.
2,Long term quality issues,"When I recieved the item, the only problem with it was a slightly bent clasp. Because of the bargain, I overlooked this relatively small matter. I thouroughly enjoyed my pearl bracelet for just over three months, wearing it almost daily. Then the strand broke near the clasp. Thankfully, I only lost one pearl, however I am very disappointed that it broke at all. Unfortunately, there is not a return, exchange, or repair policy for this item, that is viewable through this site."
5,Classic Linda Howard,"Both of these stories are great. I thought Wolfs story more intence then Joe's was but I think that come from the difference in the plots of the two stories.I loved all the characters and was very satisfied with Joes story.Great books and that they come under one cover is a steal. I am waiting for the rest of the Mackenzies, love Linda Howard."
3,Good Product with some problems,This product is an excellent item except the spring is not adjustable. This causes it to be very difficult for smaller animals like rabbits to drink the fluids. The idea and durability of the item is excellent.
1,If I could give it a zero.....,"I bought it for a mid-sized dog and it's one of the most poorly designed items I've ever seen....and what is so sad is that just a FEW minor changes would make it work. The ""flip top"" needs a screw base -- it just sits on the ""tank"" and falls off at a jostle, pouring water all over everything. The bracket is flimsy...a few centimeters on either side would hold the bottle in place much more securely; the tank falls out if I bump the kennel from the outside, much less when my dog actually tries to drink from it. And while the bottom portion DOES screw on, it's barely in place -- a half turn and water leaks all over. I can't imagine any dog that isn't very young or very tiny (and this holds a fair amount of water) who could possibly be dainty enough to use this without major spillage. Don't waste your money. The clamp holding the tank to the cage works....because when I come home, it's the ONLY thing still in place."
1,LEAKS!,"I spent hours researching this water bottle purchase. My only goal: find a water bottle that does not leak. Apparently, this is an impossible task. I fill this 32oz bottle every single day as it leaks that fast. My single ferret drinks about 1 ounce a day."
3,"Solves one problem, but creates another",I bought this water bottle for my two small rabbits because we used to have a large bottle with a metal ball that was extremely noisy when they drank. Every time the ball went up and down it would make a loud distracting noise that got very annoying. So the lever on this bottle eliminates the noise completely! The only problem is that when they lick the lever it releases too much water for them too fast and it ends up soaking their cage in a matter of one day. Very messy and wasteful! I thought they would adjust to it eventually but it has been a long time and I am still cleaning up after it every day. Shame cuz it really helped my problem with the noise! O well guess its back to using the metal ball bottles...
2,Spring makes it hard for my gerbil to drink,Great idea but not recomended for small animals. The spring is too hard for my little guy to push on to get a drink!
1,Not functional at all,"I never used this, the water leaks from the top, not functional at all, I would not rcommend this. I purchased this for my rabbits and this was wasted money"
2,"Good idea, leaks terribly","I like the flip-top design because it's easy for my 8-yr-old daughter to refill using a separate container, so she doesn't have to remove the whole bottle every time. But, water just drips out constantly, so the bedding is always drenched and the guinea pigs are always out of water. So, it is being discarded and I'm looking for a better bottle."
2,"Nice and quiet, but too messy!","Heres the thing about these bottles. I bought it because it has a lever to release the water rather than the noisy metal ball most of them have. It worked perfectly for that. It was no longer loud and annoying when my buns got a drink. However, we noticed there was a LARGE amount of water ending up on the bottom of the cage every day. We thought it might be leaking but we never once saw it drip. After more observation we discovered that the lever released too much water every time they took a drink and most of it ended up on the ground instead of in their mouth. We tried putting towels and bedding under it to soak up the water but it was such a pain and the bunnies didnt seem to like using it anymore. So we switched to a crock the size of a small bowl and they seem to really like it. Its easy, there is no mess, and we are all happy."
1,What a Rip Off - Only 2 episodes per disc.,"What a Rip Off - Only 2 episodes per disc.I am not only a big fan of the Rambo animated series, I also had the chasnce to work on it. So, when I found out the episodes were coming out on dvd, I pre-ordered them without researching more info on the discs set for release. The discs list about 11 episodes, but only have 2. I thought this must be a mistake somehow. I then played the disc in a few players and still only episodes appeared. A friend asked me did I really belive that 11 episodes would be fit on one disc if not double-sided? Which this is not. I have returned both volumes 1 - 2 for refunds. What a Rip Off!"
2,Fiction,"This book read more like fiction than a biography. I find it hard to believe that someone who was terribly burnt, survived for weeks without medical treatment. And how did they move her around with her skin falling off? Although this book was very interesting to read, some things just didn't ring true for me."
3,Tale of hideous brutality,"It is several years since I put this book down but it left a strong impression.You will be gripped by this well-written and authentic account of a Palestinian womans life, her attempted murder, and lucky escape to the west. Its a memoir that depicts an existence of almost unrelenting harshness and misery, punctuated with occasional acts of horrendous barbarism.There appears to be one or two people on here who have trouble believing that honor killings actually happen. Reading this book got me interested in the plight of similar victims across the muslim world. I recommend this website:[...]"
1,Worst book EVER written,"I mean aside the argument whether or not this is a true story, the writing of this thing is just awful. You don't sympathize with the protagonist because you get annoyed by them within the first 3 sentences. The story doesn't flow. I am not even going into the factuality of it all. You couldn't read it if it was a known piece of fiction. Don't bother buying it and if you really must get it, please get it from me because I am more than willing to get rid of the darn thing.."
4,Captivating,"This book is about a woman who survives an attempted honor killing after she has gotten pregnant by a neighbor.the neighbor professes his love for her, impregnates her and then, leaves her to deal with the consequences. she discusses village traditions which mandate that she be killed for premarital sex. She is also quite honest about her difficulties after moving to Switzerland. What makes this book a wonderful read is that she does not portray herself as ""cured"" after replanting herself in Switzerland. she discusses the psychological challenges that await her, as she tries to make a new family and also connect her old one, as her child from the improper union was adopted by another family . My only problem with the book is that Souad seems quite eager to adopt western traditions, morals and actions. I wonder if this is a product of translation."
1,Complete garbage,"This movie is complete garbage. Pionchet, his wife and Margaret Thatcher were all portrayed as buffoonish cartoon characters. Those trying to get Pinochet extradited were portrayed as lofty-minded, conscious-driven individuals. It's like Greek dramas where characters either wore a happy face or sad face.Why anyone wouldn't try making a remotely credible docudrama with believable characters is beyond me. The makers were spoon-feeding their views to the audience as if the facts just weren't enough."
1,Weak argument designed to make Christians feel better,"This book should be shelved next to ""The Bible Codes"". The Bible codes claimed to find meaningful patterns in the way letters are distributed through the bible; Kikawada and Quinn claim to find a meaningful pattern in the repetitions and contradictions of the biblical text. They claim this is the author's art, rather than evidence of separate texts having been sutured together.Their reading is simply not convincing. The repititions in Genesis do not look like the similar repititions in other Near Eastern literature. They have a different quality, which is evident to any reader who is willing to look at the texts as historical documents rather than as some kind of lifeline to God.The documentary hypothesis lives. Kikawada and Quinn are forgotten by all but a handful of tenacious Christians. Do a websearch and see who supports their theory - evangelical Christian organizations."
5,Errol Flynn was bloody good,"Captain Blood was Errol Flynn's first major Hollywood leading role. He displays natural confidence on screen, and the essence of the story allows him to present himself to the viewer in several modes, which includes: a spirited slave and an ingenious pirate.The film has a theme of injustice that is challenged by rebellion, with budding romance following each of these stages. The movie is deep with variety, which keeps the viewer well entertained.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
1,Defective DVD,The movie is great. The DVD is not. The French soundtrack does not play properly. I had to return it for a refund.
1,are you kidding?,"I agree with the people who hated this movie. what a boring, dated piece of dreck. has anyone seen any good pirate movies? this is definately not one of thm. everyone has tights and looks like a halloween reject. dont waste your money or time."
4,Errol the Great,"Errol Flynn, one of the greatest movie stars of the Golden Age. This movie proves his legend. See it Now."
5,A swashbuckler is born!,With CAPTAIN BLOOD director Michael Curtiz launches the career of action hero legend Errol Flynn. Flynn's sword skills would improve in successive films but this is where it all began. A most for anyone who loves pirates and swashbucklers.
4,Rafael Sabatini meets Michael Curtiz,"Its action, Its adventure..its about as pure as an Errol Flynn film as one can get. I dont think a Pauline Kael would have spent much time writing about this one....who cares!Lionel Atwill is frustrated, Miss De Havilland is In love( but not till the final reel). Basil Rathbone was never better as the french captain.This is the film that put Flynn on the map and you can have fun in picking out the stock actors that would populate Warner Bros films for over a decade."
3,A Classic,"This is a classic movie. One of the better produced ""swashbuckling movies"" of all time. If you're looking for a ""high-seas"" classic adventure, this is probably it!"
4,Captain Blood the movie,"I enjoyed reading the original story. The movie was almost faithful to the story except for the final events leading up to the final scene. Having said that, I enjoyed the movie and have viewed it over the years many times. Screen writers ordinarily take too much liberty with classical stories and lose the highpoints of the plots, in my estimate. Take for example the classic, ""The Count of Monte Christo"", a beautiful story, with dramatically written scences. However, as more modern movie versions are produced, the story departs further and further from the original story line. The Count of Monte Christo, never ended up with Mercedes, but only the version with Richard Chamberlin stayed faithful to that fact."
5,My Favorite Pirate of the Caribbean!,"Errol Flynn was at his BEST!Move over Captain Jack Sparrow! I absolutely love this picture. It's one of my favorite classics, even though Flynn died many years before I was even born. I fell in love with him! Captain Peter Blood is the original Pirate of the Carribean indeed. This is where it all started. Everything about this picture is grand. The story, the romance between Captain Blood and Arabella Bishop, the pirate ships, the swordfighting, and the MUSIC. The musical score is magnificent!My heart skips a beat everytime I think of this movie! That is how precious this movie is to me. I'm glad to finally own this movie on DVD."
5,Gloster Gladiator Aces,"Compared to it's successors, the Hurricane and the Spitfire, the Gloster Gladiator hasn't been much published. This book shows that this plane deserves far more than it got attention-wise. Quite a few of the great names flew Gladiators, the RAF's last fighting biplane and one of the best ever produced. This is a distinction that only the Italian Fiat Cr42 could hope to match as you learn in this book, one of the few about this plane since the classic ""The Gloster Gladiator"" from Francis K. Mason in 1964, which set the standard about publishing this plane for the last 38 years."
5,Gloster Gladiator Aces,"Compared to it's successors, the Hurricane and the Spitfire, the Gloster Gladiator hasn't been much published. This book shows that this plane deserves far more than it got attention-wise. Quite a few of the great names flew Gladiators, the RAF's last fighting biplane and one of the best ever produced. This is a distinction that only the Italian Fiat Cr42 could hope to match as you learn in this book, one of the few about this plane since the classic ""The Gloster Gladiator"" from Francis K. Mason in 1964, which set the standard about publishing this plane for the last 38 years. This year not only saw the book by Andrew Thomas, but a book by Alex Crawford as well..."
4,Oh Say Can You Seed?,Bonnie Worth touches the typical curiosity of young children through her books about nature and the environment. This title is recommended to begin the discussion between child and adult about the role of nature in the growth and development of a child.
5,Love it!,Love this book!! It gives nonfiction science content in a Dr. Seuss format. Keeps the kids' interest while they learn science - excellent!
3,chain problem,very nice piece of jewelry though the chain is knotted and i cant remove the knot without damaging the chain.
3,middle was great; ending flat,"Halfway through this book (borrowed it from the library) I was set to give up on it. I thought the two murders were grotesque and gratuitous and the prose was a little too quiet for my tastes; then, when one of the characters stumbles on the existence of the murderer, the thing took off and I couldn't put it down. But then the ending happened: flat, nothing; I wanted more, a confrontation, dialogue between the villain and the characters. The ending was so abrupt. It's a maddening book. An entertaining read, yet devoid of style or craftmanship. Since I enjoyed it, I have to recommend it. It just could have been better."
5,Once you log on the Net...anyone can find you!,"My father handed me this book becasue I was a ""computer guy"" and he thought I might enjoy it. (He would have given it 3 stars at most); but being as I am in computers...and you can do everything that is done in this book....I enjoyed it. Anyone who uses a computer, a chat room and a bulletin board will really appreciated it. The deaths are a little more gruesome than is required...but once you get pass that, the book keeps your attention.It starts slow and picks up with every page. I could not put it down. I finished it on one day! This book is a thriller even up to the last page. A must read.... this is a thoroughly entertaining novel.Note: I now turn off my computer at night."
2,Don't waste your money.,The box looks cool; the idea is good and that's about it. This games tries to mix two game-play styles (i.e.: Diablo & War Craft). The War Craft duplicate is good but it lacks the diversity of the original. It doesn't have as many advanced characters and using spells is tricky. The Diablo imitation is even less impressive. Armor and other equipment is a joke and trying to manage two players is a pain. The AI is laughable and the cut screens are unavoidable and annoying.Wait for War Craft III
5,A definite must for fantasy fans,If you like the Warcraft series and the Diablo games than you'll like this game too. It basically combines the two formats into one and creates a worthwhile gaming experience. It's nothing original as far as the gameplay but it is still a very fun and exciting game.
3,A Groundbreaking Book For Early Childhood Literacy Experts,"Donaldson's book will stand for many years as the sterling example of a clear argument promoting learning language through a combined Chomsky/Piagetian perspective. Even though she does not present a thoroughly multi-cultural vision of her thrust, she nonetheless educates the reader not only about the history of relevant literacy research but also about how to apply these theories in a classroom."
4,Gundam Battle Assault is a great game but lacks gundams.,"I never have liked bandai games very much, but i have to admit this a great game. Although I was dissapointed about the lack of gundams(wing zero, heavyarms, tallgese111,etc.) this is still a fun game. The controls are easy when you get used to them. The old 2D game play does not bother me one bit. Also, the game is just too easy. I beat it the night I got it. I would suggest to rent this game before you buy it."
2,The Bad Wins,"I recall playing this game years ago--almost a decade. This game featured a cool cast of characters, but that's it.For Gundam fans, it may have been somewhat of a treat simply because of the cast of characters and the Gundam title slapped on; however, this Gundam game is more like a slap across the face. The story is drab, the gameplay is a little uninspired and generic (almost a copy of the older 2D Dragon Ball Z fighting games--which were also pretty poor as well--replaced with Gundam characters), the game is horribly unbalanced, and the voice acting was sub-par. This was the first in a line of three Gundam fighting games to be horrible and the trilogy goes downhill with each sequel.Pros:+Fun for Gundam Fans+Lots of GundamsCons:-Generic Fighter/Another Game Using a Known Name and attaching to a bad game-UnbalancedI highly only recommend this game to hardcore Gundam fans...and even then, I warn you to rent the game first if you MUST try it out."
3,Poor game,"I got this game, and was okay with the fact that it was 2-D. The Gundams are excellent, but I was expecting alot more. I expected to go on missions, instead, you just do boss fight after boss fight, which got really annoying. Only Heero Yuy is from Gundam Wing, when Zechs, and a few others should have been included. I think I should have rented it first."
4,A Great Game,A great game indeed. Not the best graphics in the world but still good. Even if you dcouldn't tell Wing ZERO from Gundam ZZ you should buy it if you are a hardcore fighting game lover.
4,A little bit for everyone,"I just received this game, and as far as fighters go, this is a throw back to Street Fighter 2, Marvel vs. Capcom type games etc. If you are a Gundam Wing Fan, Heero is the main character, but only he and Wing are in the game. The other pilots come from the U.C. timelines as far as I can tell. I am a Wing fan, and the game is still enjoyable. The graphics are good, the sound isn't so good. The gameplay is slower due to the fact that these are machines not people. I would recomend this game more to fans of the Gundam series, rather than others, because the slowness, and old school style may not appeal to newer, and unfamiliar gamers. For those of us who love the series, not a bad purchase if you have an extra ... to spend."
4,Gyan M.S. 15,"I bought this game about 6 months ago, but it was recently that I got into the game. Great detaled 2D game play and a Great group of Mobile suits Like Hy-gogg, Sazabi, and the Z Gundams. And if I missed your Favorite Mobile Suit i'm sorry. There isn't a very good story to the game,the game play is slightly unusual, and theres not that much strategy when it comes down to the mobil suit itself not till you figure out there weakness then theres strategy. But then if you are wondering wy I gave this game 4 stars (it's really 4 1/2 Stars)? It just comes down to just plain kicking each others [rears]. So thats My Review you be shure to read other reviews from me and other Critics."
5,"Good Game, Bosses Cheesy","The game is NOT slow, like most people say, the battles go quickly, and game play takes getting used to, but overall a worthwhile buy."
2,battle assault is a complete waste of time and money,"This game was cool the first few days I got it but then it started to get old and the only one who likes it in my family is my cousin. All the charictars moves are alike. And it lacks the long time fun like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, or Chrono Cross. The only thing I like about this game was the competition the game had. Bottom line THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE TIME MUCH LESS THE MONEY."
2,3am gameplaying for the masses,"I purchased this game with high expectations...I mean, Gundams...mass destruction, I was excited. Sadly the gameplay is a bit slow and the only real challenge I got was at the end when I confronted the boss. The mechanics are similar to other fighting games and focus on combos and button smashing more than they should. Also, the changes that this game went through before reaching America's shores left it wanting. I felt cheated when I heard that the main character in Japan was *gasp* a female mobile suit pilot!! Could it be?! Wow!! And yet, when it hit America, we got Heero Yuy, a *male* MS pilot. Not that there's anything wrong with Heero, mind you, but a girl in a mobile suit was a more inspiring role model to me. All and all, even if you're a big fan of Gundam, you should spend five bucks renting the game rather than almost fifty to buy it."
4,Gundam Battle Assault,"What else is there to say about this game? You have a simi-nice gundam game. Although the controls are hard and walking to your opponit takes forever this game is somewhat worth while. If it weren't for the EXTREMELLY short game play (beat it in 10 minutes) this game would be a very nice item. And for all the hard core anime fans out there, no doubt you have to get this. But if beating the game in 10 minutes, and then game over wouldn't satisfy your gaming needs, I suggest you look for another game because you will only be throwing your money away on this one, for the amount of time you would spend playing it."
2,Gundam Battle Assault,"I had a feeling this game would be more than less, since it's on playstation and not playstation 2 or dreamcast. the line is pretty good, it's a dang shame that wing zero, tallgeese, or any other favored gundams from gundam wing aren't on this game beside wing gundam. the special moves are lack luster and limited. why does dodging take away power from your life and why do you have a limit on your shooting powers? basically this game has no appeal to me what so ever. thank god i got this game free instead of wasting my money on it. if you want a real good gundam game, then write to bandai or somebody cus this isn't worth it."
1,Jerk Out CD single,"I was very disappointed when I listened to this single. Morris Day really pulled a fast one on this. This song has a different sound than is on the album, which this version is not even close."
3,It's alright...,"This is a very academic book. So beware.We used it in our C++ course which followed along with fine. The teacher kept the pace going by doing his own created examples and lab assignments and towards the end the pace heated up a bit as we went on to OOP, which in the book is a bit weak, so you had to basically take full-on notes.What the book does is basically set out the structures in C++ over a series of long explanations. I'd say it waffles on a lot but that's the nature of a lot of academic books regardless of subject.It's better explained as a good read from cover to cover but not as a stop and go source of reference. If your angle is more ""teach yourself"" go for one of the wrox or o'reilly titles.If you're completely new to programming there are easier languages to learn first. C++ is a bit of a sledgehammer because it is hardcore."
3,OK but the Bialetti is better,This pot is certainly acceptable but in terms of quality no better than the cheap espresso makers I can get at my local supermarket (sometimes for as little as half the cost). I was a little disapointed with the quality of the casting compared to a roughly equally priced aluminum Bialetti pot. I bought this one because it came in red but in retrospect I think it might have made a better long-term investment to pay a buck or two more and get a plain Bialetti pot. I gave this pot as a gift and I'm sure it will be fine but I suspect that the Bialetti pot gives you more value for money.
5,Russian Post WWII Saga,"I lived in Moscw for 6 months in 1977 and have been back 4 additional times since then so I feel I know the Russian soul fairly well. This movie felt right for me. The little boy is a joy to watch, the naive mother is heartbreakingly pretty, and the Vor - Thief is a typical Soviet con man and very well-played. All in all an engrossing movie worth seeing. Good subtitles, too."
5,UK version not cut,"I'd just like to let everyone know who read the comments by the reviewer from Moscow, Russia above that the UK version is uncut and unchanged from the original. In fact I was disgusted to hear that they've cut the ending in the US (DVD?) version. The whole point of the ending shows how Sanyas' life outlook and where he took his life were all being affected by Tolyan. Get the UK version if you can, the US version has been ruined by dropping the original ending."
2,"Verbose, flat, dated.",A rather slow and verbose novel for an action piece . . . or just flat if viewed as some sort of mystery.
3,Journey begins refining their sound.,This is the second recording with Steve Perry as lead vocalist. The sound is a little better than Infinity without trying to utilize too many studio effects. A good listen if you want to hear the band just as they were starting to hit it big.
2,Not Their Best,"After Infinity made them stars, Journey released Evolution which was a step back for them. The album opens up on a strong note with ""Majestic"", ""Too Late"" and the great ""Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'"" but besides ""Just The Same Way"", the album is a clunker. The other songs are by-the-numbers corporate rock that don't have much feeling behind them."
1,This product is stupid,"All this 'screen' patch is, is clear plastic tape with black lines drawn on it. If you're looking for actual screen to patch a window screen, then get the aluminum variety and don't waste your time or money on these self-adhesive types."
1,What a rip off,Screen patch? Really? A crappy sticker (that doesn't stick) with some tiny squares printed on it isn't a screen. Screens have holes - they let the air in and out. Get it? Duct tape works better than these pieces of crap. How long has this company been ripping people off? If it didn't cost like $2 I would have sent it back.
3,Screen-illustrated tape!,"We purchased this product for a large hole in our screen door--our large dog jumps on the door and we didn't feel like replacing the entire screen yet, since we haven't yet trained him to stop. We ordered these patches, and were amused to find that they are simply clear tape with screen lines printed on them. They lasted until the first time it rained. They are OK for their purpose, which might include patching a tent window, or some screen that doesn't get wet. Or some screen that doesn't really need to look perfect. If you're looking for a long-term solution to holes in your screens, this is not it."
1,Crap,"This is a glorified sticker! I ordered this on my phone so I was unable to read the reviews, I never would have waster the $8 on stickers to put on a tent. They don't hold up to rain so I don't know why you would sell for something that is OUTDOORS!"
2,Way too small,Ring is way too small and looks like a toy when putting it on. I would not recommend if you want a nice 1/2 carat ring.
2,Avoid Rubber Insert Soles,"Every time I've bought shoes with these rubber insert soles, they've fallen apart at the rubber-leather joint in a few months. They're terrible."
3,Sole peels apart easily,"Picked up a pair like this in deerskin at the Men's Wearhouse, but only like 2 months later the sole started coming apart, where the rubber meets up with the leather. The rest of my dress shoes, leather sole or rubber sole have lasted me 6 years minimum. I wanted a full leather sole, but settled with this style, and now I won't ever do that again. Otherwise, I still give 3 stars for the deerskin was very nice and soft."
3,Not So Easy,"I bought this game with high expections for my 5 year old Barbie- loving daughter who has just begun to take an interest in the Playstation the past few months. You are Barbie in this game trying to solve a who-dunnit mystery by talking to passengers and crew on a cruise ship and at various ports. Manuevering is not so easy when more advanced reading skils are required--older kids would probably fare much better. With much of my help, we made it far enough to discover the missing item, however my daughter lost interest since she couldn't do much of the game by herself."
5,Great for Parent & Child Together,I sat down with my two daughters ages 5 and 3 and played this game WITH them. We had a great time with it. They loved the adventure and I helped them to understand how to look for Ken and follow the clues. Now that they have been through the game they can play it alone. Especially my 5 year old. All of the clues change for the next game. I give it a thumbs up!
1,"This game is too complicated for me, let alone my 5-year-old","Do I have to give it a star at all? This is by far the worst game my daughter owns. It's so difficult to play that my daughter needs my help constantly. And I find it extremely slow, and frustrating. Trust me, this game will aggravate both you AND your child. Save your money, folks."
2,I bought this used,"This may have be a pretty nice game, but I bought it used and it is a little distorted with slow movements. Looking beyond the defects, young Barbie girls will like this."
2,disappointed.,"It says it's 2 player, but it isn't really two player. it's blurry and slow. I don't really like it."
3,fun,i bought this game a few years ago ... used to play it all the time but barely now since i'm out of the Barbie mode ... it is fun and enjoyable but i like games that you're more involved with instead of just sitting back and watching stuff happen that you can't make decisions on and be apart of ... it is fun and i would recommend it for kids who like mysteries
5,Worked great!,"I bought these to replace the standard lamp trailer lights I had. They installed great and were super bright, nearly blinding, when viewed from behind. They lit up very well and were easily seen during the day too! Installation was simple and straightforward."
2,they are big $,I put these on my boat mounted above the water. Tail lites work but brake and turn signal very faint.So I rewired the trailer and still same issue.Some days you win some you don't.Wish I had bought these local so I could return them with out having to deal with the postage. I'll eat mine .
5,i own it,"This is a great cell phone case. A little on the expensive side but, well worth the extra money"
4,Excellent resource,"I found this book an excellent source of information about the writings of Agatha Christie. A short essay covers each of the works including short stories. There is also a large section covering the characters from each of the books and stories. In addition there is a section on movies, plays and TV productions of the various stories. Some of the plots are given away a bit if you read up on the characters, etc. before you read the book. Read the book first and find out more about it from this resource afterwards. I find this an extra tool to bring more enjoyment from the writings of Agatha Christie."
4,Summer of My German Soldier,The quality is OK for its age. The story is a good one for showing that all Germans weren't bad and that Jews and Germans could be friends and help each other. War truly does make strange bedfellows. The movie does a good job of following the book.
1,"Concept this, foo'","Concept albums usually suck, but because it was TSL, i decided to pick up BOATS. Well, i was right, it did suck. But what really got me is that people had the nerve to say this record was better than the previous. Drew, your opinion doesn't count. You are an ignorant turd, and your useage of the words ""Crybaby emo"" and ""Bubblegum pop"" to describe music that is neither only adds basis to my analysis. New rule; no one with an IQ below that of a glass of water should be reviewing. That means you, drew. Don't buy, unless you actually didn't like TSL's debut and think you may want to give them a shot. They might as well change the name of their band, because this isn't the same band that made SILYMI."
1,Are You Kidding Me???,"What happened on this album??? The Starting Line took a few steps back with this CD. If this is their new mature sound then its probably the last TSL CD I purchase. ""Say It Like You Mean It"" is 10 times better than this CD. I have listened to this album numerous times and I just can't get into it. It doesn't have those catchy lyrics that I'm used to with Ken and the boys. I'm seeing these guys on the Nintendo tour this fall and I'll probably be disappointed because they will play stuff off this album and they will suck. If you liked this CD compared to their old stuff then you are LOCO!!!"
1,AW-FUL!,"I loved TSL's debut. This record though, is on my shortlist for 2005's WORST! They went from being a catchy punk-emo band to a ""modern rock"" disaster. I would do a rundown of good vs. bad songs, but they ALL SUCK. If i wanted to listen to crap like this, i'd but a record from seether or the all american rejects. They effin' sold out, no two ways around it, and i hope they enjoy playing shows for indifferent top 40 rock crowds who love you until Dark New Day comes out with a new record. DONT BUY!"
3,Listen to it twice,"This album is different from say it like you mean it in that, you almost have to open up that little booklet that comes with your cd and read the way ken writes his thoughts and experiences. The album gets better everytime i hear it.Best song:Surprise,surprise."
2,Shows potential,"""Based on a true story"" is no 5 star album, but I can't deny that it shows alot of promise. Unlike their previous record, which was a total punk-pop joke, TSL have matured and turned into real songwriters. At times, the ""mature"" listener may find themselves a little put off by the overall manufactured sound of BOATS, but it's easy to overlook with kenny's sweet, melodic voice. I couldn't really enjoy ""Based on a true story"" for more than two listens, and my guess is it'll (my copy) be up for sale within the next few days. I guess the easiest way to break it down is; Good Charlotte fans will give this 5 stars, while fans of The bravery and Coldplay will give it 1 or 2. It all just depends on what stage you're at musically. 2 solid stars."
4,Give it a little time,"Yeah so this album isn't as instant as the older one but it really has a sound of a band who finally know what they wan't to sound like,before they could have just been tossed away into the pile of pop punk contempories but with this album i think they have shown a growth. Sure they havent exactly gone full circle and changed their sound but they have a lot more songs which require a little more thought that just catchness 'Photography' is the sort of song that would't go amiss on a Coldplay cd and 'Ready' has a dark broodyness to it that you would not associate with the Starting Line. But where they have mature songs thay also haven't lost their roots. 'Bedroom Talk' is a classic pop song as is 'The World'. Lyrically superior,musically superior and a very very underrated album."
5,This Rules!!,"This CD is the best CD ever!! I cannot explain to you in enough words how great this CD is. The songs on this album really touched me in a way that whenever a song plays, it somehow relates to my life in someway. ""Bedroom Talk"" is the greatest insight to all the things that go on in a teenager's mind when thinking about sex. The emotions and the feelings toward this topic are so on point that you feel like Kenny is singing for you. Number 7 and 11 on this CD are very good as well. In fact, I'm using track 11 on our senior powerpoint presentation since it's a song about being one and together accomplishing something. Go out and buy this album!!"
3,The starting line,"Well this cd was deffinetly....different from the last. It's not bad, just different. After listening to the cd, the songs really haven't sparked anything inside me. I've been a huge tsl fan for a while, and the cd kinda disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, Ready is a great song, and the b-list, and bedroom talk get stuck in my head. I just think some of the lyrics are kinda mediocre. For example: Making love to the camera, is it just me, or do they sound kinda..idk.. in to themselves.Who knows, but overall the cd is okay. Say it like you mean it was definitley better"
5,Definitely Different,"It's obvious that this CD is not Say It Like You Mean It, and that the band's sound has changed. I for one love the new stuff, and think that it shows quite a development for the band musically. You can tell they've experienced a lot since they wrote their first record, even their first EP.For those of you who really liked the old CD, listen to it a couple of times and try to get into some of the songs. Ken's lyrics are satirical half of the time and you have pay attention to catch them. This is a band that is trying to do things their own way, and they're not writing songs for anyone but themselves now.It really is a good album, i didn't like it all that much when i first listened to it, and now i can't stop listening to it. If it's not your kind of music, that's cool, but recognize that this band hasn't gotten worse, they've just started writing the music that they want to write."
2,Based On A Boring Story,"Don't you remember the first time you looked in the mirror and you wondered why there was hair growing in certain places and why things grew when they were excited? Well, this is what we call puberty. It is a time where we become a ""man"" and ""mature."" This goes hand in hand with The Starting Line's new album. The guys dropped their poppy roots and decided they need to ""mature."" With their new found maturity, there was a road block. To keep this short, this album is lacking in every aspect. You get dragged through their ""maturing"" process and have to listen to songs that have no substance or any standing power.Maturity can be a good thing, but in the case of Based On A True Story, maturing was based on a boring story and dull music."
1,They have matured like a down-syndrome man,"This cd shows no maturation at all. Most of the songs sound the same and they all sing sellout to me. Since when was it ""mature"" to sing about sex? Even animals do it. It's not mature at all. ""Inspired By the $"" is just as bad as ""Given the Chance"" in that it's a corny pop song with extremely cheap lyrics. I have no respect for Starting Line now. They have completely sucked everything they had up."
2,A sophmore slump,"Anyone who knows tsl knows this record really didn't do the band justice. it just isn't what tsl has the potential to do. I've heard some leaked demos of the new stuff, and it sounds like tsl is back to their roots."
2,What the hell?,"What happend to The Starting line? The one that gave me that great album which I gave 5 stars? This is not them. Flat out crap. I mean sure its OKAY I guees. But not Starting line at all. Though they are from PA they had that Southern California sound that everyband was branching away from now of days. I could understand if they would change from Punk Rock to more Alternative in a few albums but not so fast. I honestly did not believe anyone when they said that this was The Starting Line. I was first in line the day it came out, and really wish I would of just burned it. Buy it if you must. If your new to the band you'll probably like it. But I know I dont."
2,?confused?,"Honestly, I don't know what to say about this record. I know it's nowhere near as good as ""say it like you mean it"" (that was obvious at first listen), but at the same time, I don't totally hate it either. Some of the songs are awesome, like bedroom talk, which despite having sub-par lyrics, is actually very catchy and TSL-esque. Others though, are not. Autography gives me a headache, as do many others. The album seems to start off okay, With Making love to the camera and Inspired by the $ sign, but it falls about in weird places. Also, I found Based on a true story to not have the same ammount of replay value as SILYMI. After about 6 or 7 listens, I was pretty much done with it. This album really confuses me, becasue unlike so many others, I have no real clear cut opinion about it. Overall, I'd say skip it unless you consider yourself a big fan, or have alot of disposable income."
1,Stupid lyrics!!!,"""I'm gunna tear ur a** up girl""??? What the hell is that!? Were these guys in some kind of competition with 50cent to create the worst lyrics possible. On top of that, the theme to this album is very boring. Motion picture? I don't get it. I find it almost funny that these guys were the ones protesting to save philly alternative radio when their lyrical content rivals that of snoop doggy dogg's. Their first album blew this piece of crap out of the water, and if you're smart you'll get that one instead. no wonder why it was only 7 bucks at target..."
1,Dropping The Bar,"This is the first I've listened to Based On A True Story because the bits and pieces I had heard, I disliked. But I made myself listen to the full cd, and probably shouldn't have. Musically, it's below Say It Like You Mean It, and Make Yourself At Home. It's not a step up for this band, it's definitely a step down. The lyrics aren't nearly as good as the previous releases and musically it's downright awful. There's a few goodpoints on the cd, but finding those is the real trick. It's definitely not worth the money spent on it...If you like pop punk, save your money for better releases, such as Move Along, by The All American Rejects. But, if you want a cd that will put you to sleep in about 20 minutes, then by all means, buy this one."
4,Give it a try before you bash...,"Ok im a huge TSL fan and have been one for quite sometime....And I admit when I first purchased the cd I was a tad bit let down...but after i listened to the cd a couple more times through I found that this is a good cd...Songs like Ready and Surprise, Surprise are great songs and the rest are equally good....It's no Say It Like You Mean IT....but it's equally as good...which is why I give it 4 stars because they didn't really do anything new...but why fix what isn't broken?"
3,"Good, But not that good","The starting line was one of the bands that made me appreciate pop-punk music. I am a die hard blink fan, and then when i picked up tsl's ""say it like you mean it"" i was overwhelmed with a sense of happiness and I was in love. The starting line are a fantastic band all around no matter what, but the way they are headed with this new record is no where close to how they used to sound. I have to say that the new album is not near as good as the old one. I would even say ""with hopes of starting over"" is more enjoyable for me to listen to. The new sound is a little different, almost like a rock style. The way that ken vasoli sings his lyrics is more angry and raspy than what it used to be. I would say, go with the old one before you buy this one, you'll be glad you saw what they were compared to what they have become."
3,Not Up to Par,"At first when I heard the Starting Line was coming out with a new CD, I was really excited to hear their new songs. I started listening to the songs and they were kind of mediocre. I was actually disappointed to hear the songs. Some songs had a catchy tune, but the lyrics were bad and vice versa. I do enjoy the song ""Bedroom Talk."" ""I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married."" haha I think thats funny. Also I like ""The World,"" but I have suspisions that the song is communist!!! lol My friends say I'm crazy, but I see through the Starting Line's tactics to get people into communism!!! lol j/k Besides that its a good song!"
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?,"The first CD was ear friendly, not the best band in the world but full of energetic pop punk songs. I know its a good idea to change your sound because you don't want to be one of those bands that sounds the same but this band has done a complete one eighty and the CD over all is terrible. Better luck next time."
3,Better than the last? I disagree,"Everyone keeps saying how Starting Line has ""matured"" and this album is so much better than the last, but I don't see it. I am a big Starting Line fan, I love their last album (Say it like you mean it) and saw them in concert. However, I was disappointed by their new album as it was just OK. The first album's lyrics and melodies all combined perfectly to really amaze me (which is characterized by involuntary chills). Parts of this album tried to get there, and did at brief parts, but overall wasn't up to my expectations, and isn't something I crave to listen to again. It reminds me a lot of Something Corporate...I thought that Leaving Through the Window was great, but North was lackluster. So if you share that opinion then this review should be meaningful to you. I strongly recommend Acceptance's Phantoms instead of this album, especially if you liked TSL's first album better."
2,"like everyone says, Say It Like You Mean It was better...","the starting line started out as a young pop/rock kind of singers...and i loved it...and now in their Based on a True Story is more mellow, an alternative kind of a music which is in turn not as catchy as the songs in their first CD...their first EP was just like their Say It Like You Mean It and then their second EP, right before Based On A True Story was released it changed a bit..it has already been said but if you thoroughly enjoyed their first CD then think about this before you buy this CD...hope this helps...-Paul"
4,Photon Ultrasonic Distance Meter,This is a very helpful tool when getting measurments to estimate the materials you need to do an upgrade to your home.
2,Would not buy again,"I bought this thinkig it would be helpful in getting accurate measurements for jobs around the house. Laser is the way to go, this is ultrasound based, the laser just tells you where you are pointig and does not do the measurement; and the readings vary so widely that I cannot trust it to actually purchase materials. It may be ok for rough estimates of larger spaces like a barn, etc, but pretty worthless for say kitchen flooring or sheetrock, etc. I guess you get what you pay for, so I am going to rely on a standard tape measure for accuracy, this tool will probably see little use at all...?tag sale item. ps the directions are your typical impossible to undertand ones written by somebody who does not know english..."
5,Bicycle Fork,This fork is all black and I had to cut it down to fit but I knew this before I order it.Like most self built bicycle you have to cut some of the parts to fit well.Just take your time and do it right because you only get one cut if you cut it to short so do the math first then check before you cut and you will have a great front fork.The add on break tips are great too.
4,Great Product,"Bought this product after returning another substitute product. Compared to the returned, although a bit more expensive, it makes me feel it is a proper and safe product."
5,I Need Mucho Filter,"So, it's a filter. It's the exact same part number as the one I took out, and it's the same brand. It fits. It works. It was WAAAYYY less expensive here than at the big box store."
5,great item,"I have a whirlpool refrigerator and this filter works excellent , and best of all my last one lasted allot longerthen normal so I would highly recommend buying this as a replacement when you need to. Thank you very much and I will definetly buy one again when I need one to replace mine again."
3,Water Filter,It is hard to say if it is working as it should. There are still some sediments in the ice although I have another type of filter attached to the water supply as well. Will observe over a few more months and review again.
1,Discolored,"I usualy just go to the big box for this item, but decided to save the gas and order on Amazon. Unfortunately, the water came out black. Returned for replacement. Hopefully the second one works better."
5,Great,"Just what I needed for a whole lot less $$$. Highly recommended, awesome, cool, more words needed to complete review .........."
4,Fits and Works as Advertised,"We rarely use the water from the fridge, but my wife insists on having crystal clear ice. If not for that I would just yank the filter out and never replace it. A small chunk of change for having clean ice.The filter does the job, and I replace it about every 12 months or so. I took a star off due to the price, not the product."
4,8171413,"What can you say about a water filter, either it works or it doesn't work. From my taste experience, it works."
5,What a Deal,This was a excellent deal on a great product.I had shop at a couple of local stores only to find the price higher than I wanted to pay.So finding the 2 pack deal I got was a blessing.Thanks
5,Quick Shipping..,"Great transaction. I saw what I needed, bought it (for about 20% cheaper than Lowes) and it came quickly. What's to lose?"
2,Plastic Tasting,"Sorry folks, but I don't know if I got a lemon or what, but after following instructions on how to install the filter,etc, the end result was water tasting like plastic. The only way i can assume this happened is that the filter sat in the warehouse in the dog days of summer long before it came into the consumers hands. Too bad because it installed and was fine otherwise, but the taste cannot be ignored. Amazon had the best price for this but if I were you, I would probably buy locally if you can. Otherwise, it's a crapshoot in terms of knowing if you will get one that is free from plastic taste or not."
4,good alternative,"This is a good alternative for when you want miso, but don't have the time to make it from scratch. If it wasn't so expensive I would have it more often. But if you can find real miso paste in your area, it is far more econimical to buy noodles, paste, tofu, and whatever veggies you like to put in it."
3,wrong nutritional info,"Why does no one mention the nutrtional info that is listed and repeated is wrong . Just purchased Miso soup bowl same item as picture 240 Cal per serving 990 !!!mg sodium etc. Makes me suspect of all the reviewsand Amazon, you can list and post anything. Maybe innocent error, but a waste for consumers"
2,Bland - Doesn't Taste Like Miso - Strong Green Onion Flavor,"I was very disappointed in this product. I love Miso soup and the packaging on this was very enticing. But rather than Miso Soup, this should be called Green Onion Soup.The noodles are OK and if you like a VERY strong green onion flavor - this would be a good choice. Just don't make this selection expecting a strong Miso flavor."
2,Not very MISO,I ordered this with hope of having a decent MISO soup in a bowl but the taste is not there it is very bland and dose not have any flavor you would expect from a tradition MISO. If your looking for something similar to a restaurant style or flavor avoid this product. Additionally the plastic bowls these items ship in crack and break apart easily.
1,Nasty flavor,"Annie Chun's noodle bowls are downright nasty! The noodles are way too gummy. They should have used dry noodles that soften up when in hot water. The texture would end up much better.I like Miso soup, and bought three of these, and four other ""flavors"", because I like the foods that are pictured on the packages, but none of them taste anything like what I have eaten in the past. They're all just nasty tasting! The miso doesn't taste anything like miso soup. I was SO dissapointed!I wanted my kids to try these yummy ""looking"" kinds of foods because they have tried and liked sushi, but I won't ask them to try these. I KNOW they won't like them.Just disgusting!!"
1,Tasted pretty bad,"I bought one at Trader Joe's to try out this brand especially the picture on the front label looking so delish and tempting...I get home and try this soup out and thought it just tasted awful! I like miso soup btw but this just didn't cut it. It just tasted so bland, pictures can be so deceiving :("
3,So-so miso soup,"Bought this from a warehouse store. I have had many miso soups at different Japanese restaurants. This one taste nowhere near a decent miso soup. It's a little sour, and don't have enough flavor.But it is very convenient. Perhaps there's something I can add to it to give it more flavor."
3,Disappointed : (,"My first experience with Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls was the Kimchi. It is awesome. I highly recommend that one. Recently Annie Chun products were on sale so I bought the Miso as Amazon was out of Kimchi. I love Miso so I figured it would be as good as the Kimchi only not spicy. Wrong. I've had Kikkoman instant miso soup before and it has a better miso flavor. And I ate it plain. I added spinach, tofu and a a touch of sliced mushrooms to Annie's and it still was just ok. It does have the noodles though--they're fun. But my opinion is that if you like miso you will find this lacking. I will not be purchasing this one again."
2,Not impressed,"This is pretty much gross for the most part. Here are the pros, and cons about this itemPros- Looks nice on the outside(Possibly this is the only reason I bought it)-Noodles looked tasty-Healthy, low sodiumCons-The noodles tasted very bland. Almost as if you were eating paper. I'm not sure if that the way the product was originally intended like that but either way I didn't like the taste. There had to have been some way to season the noodles to unleash their potential.-No tofu-Very low on see weed, that green leaf stuffIn the end I don't recommend it all. It won't fill you up, it will leave you feeling like you didn't eat anything at all. And it is somewhat overprices. [...]"
4,Great for the office,"I buy these soup bowls and take them into work. I usually work over lunch and they provide a fairly healthy light lunch (fairly because they are a little salty). The dried tofu in them usually doesn't reconstitute well but everything else is fine.My only complaint is the biodegradable marketing gimic, a nice idea but I think it is mostly to make people feel better. Nothing rots in the landfills. And I tried putting one of these bowls in the compost heap, two years later it is still kicking around somewhere in the backyard (no it didn't rot). The paper wrapper and plastic wrapper are certainly not compostable."
3,"Good for a microwave meal, but not great for miso soup","If you're a miso aficionado, this might not be the product for you. The broth is pretty thin, not too flavorful, and the tofu is sparse (my bowl had only 2 small cubes). The addition of the udon noodles is the soup's saving grace---it makes it a half-way decent meal. If you're looking for a good soup, this is a good choice; if you're looking for a good *miso* soup, I'd suggest trying elsewhere."
1,Nothing like cover picture. Pasty undercooked noodles floating in LOTS of bland liquid,"I don't why but I was at Trader Joe's and got five of these soups. I just tried the last one, the Phad Thai. I have tried five times now and there is NO WAY that the picture on the box is the actual soup. I get pasty uncooked noodles in a very watery bland broth. The picture on the cover is marked, yes, ""serving suggestion"", but does that mean I have to make my own sauce that actually sticks to the noodles like a glaze, as seen in the picture? What we get is just noodles floating in hobo soup. Gross. I've eaten other lunch stuff like Trader Ming's Peanut Satay and noodles and NOW THAT is awesome and restaurant quality.Not sure who is buying Annie Chun's soups. Its misleading."
1,not a miso soup,"I was looking for miso soup and just bought this bowl in supermarket for comparison with instant miso soup in packages. I don't like the bowl soup at all. I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets, each packet yield 2 cups soup, so it produces 8 cups soup for just about $5 with great miso taste. Even Amazon cannot beat that deal."
1,Toilet water,"I've never had miso soup but I highly doubt this is what it's suppose to taste like. It tastes like hot toilet water. Seriously. It's bland, no flavor at all, not even salty, just totally unsatisfying. I liked the noodles though but not even noodles can save this soup. I even added less water like reviews suggested and it didn't help at all. I've also tried Annie's Udon soup and it's gross as well. I won't be trying anymore of Annie's soups, they seem to all have a similar flavor that is just bland and disgusting."
1,Bland noodle miso soup,"I liked everything about the product except the taste. The maker obviously put a lot of work into the noodles, packaging and organic nature of the product. More green onions and fewer noodles would help. Very flat taste."
2,Annie Chun's Test,"I wanted to try out Annie Chun's soup after seeing it so much at friends houses and in the stores. So I decided upon shopping one day to pick up a bowl of their Miso Soup. Overall I find the soup quite bland and the noodles quite nicely cooked in the end but quite rubbery. Following the directions you loosen up the noodles with a cup of hot water, and the only downside is they tend to break up into pieces and tear apart instead of loosening up. As far as the broth goes, surprisingly it was nice but it tastes and smells much like cheaper brands.Overall My ScalesTaste: 4/10Texture: 3/10Smell: 2/10 (Virtually no aroma)Overall Pleasure Score: 5/10"
2,"Look OK, but not that great.","I bought these as an inexpensive gift for my girlfriend. You get what you pay for; the other day, the pearl came off of the backing as she was taking it off. Naturally this happened AFTER it was too late to return the item. So if you want to wear these once, that works, but they aren't suitable for long-term use."
1,The Holes Don't Fit the Quarters!,"I used the first Whitman binder for the first three years of the statehood quarters and it held the quarters pretty well. But something strange happened when they made the binders for years 4 through 7 (Vol. 2) and 8 through 10 (Vol. 3). They must have got the idea that the U.S. Mint shrunk the size of the quarter, because it is almost impossible to fit the quarters in the slots. All have to be raised up on an end to fit snugly, but it looks awful. That didn't work for me, so I have found another binder that does a better job. It's hard to believe the leading coin book maker missed the boat on this one."
2,Statehood Quarters#2,I am very unhappy with the new Statehood Quarter #2 book. I purchased 2 and wasted my money. The quarters do not fit in the slots that were made for them. The slots are way too small. I had to manually enlarge the slot in order to use the books.
5,A Colt 45 Christmas Indeed!,"Afroman stays true to form while making parodies of christmas songs. Definately give me the christmas spirit. My faves are ""Police Blow My Wad"", and ""Let Her Blow"". I recommend this cd to any Afroman fan, or anyone looking for a funny christmas cd."
4,Great for Afrofans,"Great CD for all of the afroman fans out there, its great comedy, with parodies from all sorts of christmas songs, i would definately recommend it for a christmas gift to any afroman fans or anyone who likes parody."
4,Pretty fixture,"This fixture looks very pretty installed and functions well. I like the distance it is from the wall; allows me to stand up straight and not have to lean over. I would give it 5 stars except we had trouble installing it at the wall to keep it from leaking. My husband scratched the chrome trying to get it tight enough, but he did successfully tighten it to where it doesn't leak. It was all an installation problem and not a product fault."
4,"Dick Tracy, he's no phony.","This is the single version of Ice-T's ""Dick Tracy"" song from themovieof the same name. It is nothing like the version featured on the moviesoundtrack. That version was like a 1930s rap song (yes, i'm aware that rap didn't exist back in the 1930s). The version of ""Dick Tracy"" here is more contemporary, with different backing music and a completely different rap by Ice. This version is a lot better than the movie version. There are actually four different mixes of the song, which are as follows:1. Dick Tracy (Radio Edit) 3:312. Dick Tracy (Vocal Version) 6:143. Dick Tracy (Instrumental) 6:074. Dick Tracy (Bonus Beats) 5:55The Vocal Version is the complete version. The Radio Edit fades out early. The Instrumental is the Vocal Version with Ice-T's rap missing, but the other vocalists still included. Bonus Beats is the Vocal Version with no vocalists."
3,Comb binding,"These combs are a bit flimsy and tend to wear out with repeated stretching on a comb binding machine, however, they are inexpensive. I have not had luck finding more durable binders, and I have tried other brands."
5,Great Organizer!,"This item has been great for me - I have a small hall closet with a very deep top shelf that tended to swallow up the scarves, hats and mittens. It fits neatly over the door, and the closet door closes just fine with the unit installed. Best of all, there are 24 pockets to get (and keep!) organized!I love it!"
4,Very good album,"This one is even better than the first one. It has a lot of keyboards, which add some extra flavor to Edge of Sanity's tasty death metal. Sound and tempo are very diverse again. It's both powerful and melodic, vocals are both growl and clean..... A real concept album.44 tracks. Swano did an interesting thing with the first Crimson by putting the whole album into 1 track. Now he's divided it into 44. He pushed the boundaries again.Why 4 stars? Guitars and drums sound pretty artificial for my taste, although they sound very powerful.Anyway, whoever liked the first Crimson, definitely will worship this one as well."
3,Beware the 2011 remastered re-issues!,"Beware the 2011 remastered re-issue, it was badly mastered.There are gaps and fade-outs between ""parts"" of the albums, like the records were remastered using the CD versions. Not only that, the fade-outs parts are actually repeated during the fade-ins! Even the CD versions don't do that.That being said, the remastered albums sound amazing. It's just frustrating to have the flow cut every 5 minutes.If those gaps don't matter to you, get it. Otherwise, wait for another remaster (if there's any). I don't know if the 2003 vinyl release has this issue, but you might as well look for one of those instead."
5,"Crimson II, ie the sequel to Crimson.","Simple Duh.When I first heard Crimson, it was unlike anything I had heard before(especially the length) and its excellent storyline totally blew me away. Now that I had an idea of how a epic concept album should be made, the amazement is considerably less. Crimson II as almost every reviewer here and elsewhere on the net have stated is like Crimson with keyboards(in fact riffs off the original are reused in places, with good effect). However, once I began to decipher the plot my interest returned. Anyway the big question is whether this is as good as most reviewers make it out to be. Not to me. Its probably the third best EoS album(after Crimson and Purgatory Afterglow) and an essential to lovers of this kind of music, though I don't need to tell you that."
5,Simply Incredible,"This CD blew me away the first time I listened to it, and somehow it gets better every time! I love the original Crimson, which I consider Edge of Sanity's finest work, although they have never put out anything bad.Crimson II has some similarities with the original Crimson. Some of the guitar riffs are similar and it has a similar feel to it. However, Dan Swano's singing has changed a bit from his previous Edge of Sanity albums. His singing is deeper, but not as gravely. It sounds a lot like Mikael Akerfeldt on Blackwater Park (Opeth), although Akerfeldt's backup vocals are not on this Crimson release. The clean vocals are also amazing.All in all, this is a fitting goodbye from Edge of Sanity to the world. Dan Swano's musical genius has never dissapointed yet, and it definitely does not with this album. I'm still trying to decide if I like it better than the original Crimson."
3,Shouldermusic,"A nice CD. Has some good music. If you like lots of harmonica, this is a good CD for you!Tucky"
5,"Well rounded, provides insight into world-wide disbelief","Stein is the editor of numerous anthologies and encyclopedias of skeptical nature, but this is by far his best. There are so many topics available to the reader, making for a smorgasbord of Atheist material. The book includes sections on Atheism in the history of many of the world's great nations, such as Russia, China, India, et cetera. There is copious amounts of information on those who chose to utter blasphemy against the faith they were raised in (such as apostates from Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, et cetera).The contributing authors include some big names, such as George A Wells on the topic of Jesus historicity, James Randi on the topic of hoaxes and frauds, and numerous other highly regarded experts in their respective fields. All in all, this is an impressive compilation of essays by the finest skeptics in the world today."
2,No Good!,"The back is very thick, which pushes your neck forward and the sides are too short to support your head. On me, and I am not particularly large, the sides come to just under my ears which does not offer enough support. It is going to be returned."
1,poor version of a pillow with small neck area,"A couple other reviews mentioned the pillow wasn't stuffed enough; however, I didn't see any reviews mentioned the fit to the neck. I have a normal size neck and the size was more for a child's neck. The image online was blocked by the white label. Once I took off the label, the pillow fell flat due to lack of stuffing and the neck region was tiny."
3,Bucky fuzzy wuzzy U pillow,"It's not the beautiful blue-gray color I thought it would be. I recently lost my blue neck pillow on a post-holiday flight, and I was hoping to replace it with an exact match, since that pillow had been my traveling companion for many years. This one's OK, but it's not the pillow I wanted. I'm pretty certain that my pillow was periwinkle blue, and this one was listed as such. However, it's a pastel shade.Basically, it's not what I wanted, but I've searched extensively for another periwinkle blue pillow and haven't been able to find one. So it's just ""okay."""
2,Not deep enough,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said this wasn't deep enough. It worked ok as some lumbar support, but was not at all useful for head and neck support on a cross country flight."
2,Weird shape,"I had a bucky pillow years ago, and loved it. I replaced it with a brookstone pillow that was so great, my husband stole it and then they got expensive. So I bought one of these fuzzy wuzzy bucky pillows with the snap and go feature for my luggage. It's no good. The back end is too thick, not enough ""arms"" for the sides of the neck, if you try to sit back in a chair with it, it pops your head forward because of how thick the back is. Tried to swap it with my husband, he isn't having any of it! I was, like, hey, mom, you want a comfy neck pillow? She tossed it back in less than 5 minutes. Very sad."
2,VERY small neck,Not sure why more people aren't commenting about the neck size. This seems like a child's pillow. Very strange. It was very soft though.
3,OK Product,"Simple product, comfortable and easy to travel with. I don't think it was worth the money though. Found a few better neck pillows that were cheaper, but it was too late to return."
5,Bucky Fuzzy Wuzzy U Pillow,My new Bucky neck pillow is very comfy and soft. It's a little smaller than my original Buckey but still is great for road trips in the car and for lounging in my favorite TV chair.
5,Awesome neck pillow,"I carry my Fuzzy Wuzzy pillow during my business travels to prevent neck pain after falling asleep during the flight. I like it very much! I can also use it even while watching TV on the couch, or reading a book in bed. It's compact, and if the back part gets too fluffy for wherever I'm leaning on I can slightly rotate it to one side and it still feels comfy.Another plus is I can simply remove the cover and throw it in the washer when it gets dirty. This was my primary concern when searching for a travel pillow as I will be carrying it around and it's prone to get dirty.Only thing I wish is they have a longer, more luggage-friendly strap for the pillow - I attach it to my bag with a carabiner, and it always twists around. But overall, it's a very comfortable, nice pillow and I am happy with it."
3,Electric tea kettle,"It works well, doesn't drip when I pour, that is important. Volume of water is a bit short to fill my tea pot."
2,Impossible to clean,"It can't be opened, and you are supposed to refill it through the spout, which is about the size of a quarter. Over time, buildup of minerals inevitably occurs on the inside surface and there's no way to get it out."
2,more or less junk,"I feel like a company that doesn't put an on/off switch on an electric appliance with heating elements might have some issues. It's also not the most ergonomic configuration-- it's very easy to spill water when it's full, and the only place you can fill it is through the spout... hm. I guess it makes tea, though. Probably not worth what I paid for it."
1,Shocking Plug Problem!,"I have owned this tea kettle for two years, and have noticed that the cord gets hot. Today I unplugged it and not only was there a spark and crack, but an electrical jolt went through my hand and up into my arm. I had been very careful to just touch the plastic part - know that I did not touch the metal prong - and did not have my other hand on metal or anything. More than and hour later my hand and arm are still in pain from the electrical shock. I plan to throw this kettle out. I do not recommend it."
1,Not a good value!!,I have two other electric tea kettles and this one is VERY slow to boil water. The metal piece on the spout is flimsy. Spend a few more dollars for a better model.
2,Tea kettle review,"I recommend going with a more expensive kettle. If filled too full, the water comes shooting out the spout. It does have a rather cute little whistle when carrying it empty to the facet - sounds like a little person saying ""ha ha ha"", so the smile might be worth it."
2,Does what it says - barely. Only 750 watts,"This electric kettle does heat water (though not quickly) and it does whistle (though not very loudly).It's adequate, but only just.I'll buy something to replace it next week."
4,Presto,I think the tea kettle is efficient and quick. I didn't realize it would whistle when it boiled and that was a pleasant surprise. I wish it held just a little more water but otherwise I am happy with it.
3,Tea pot,"Heats up water very fast. But there is no on/off switch or indicator light showing it is on. It is either plugged in and on, or unplugged and off."
4,great deal,"I bought one of these for myself and 2 other people...we love it. No more forgetting you have the water on or waiting for it to heat up. It's fast, only a few minutes, stays hot longer than microwave heating and it lets off a loud enough whistle when it's hot to let you know it's ready. Better than traditional tea kettles and hot pots!"
3,Not outstanding but it does the trick,"I didnt expect this product to change the way I look at making tea, I just wanted it to heat up water quickly, and I have no complaints after 5 months of use."
2,false advertisement,This product was advertised as being able to heat water faster than a microwave. They must be referring to a very old and low powered microwave. Our standard tea kettle on the stove top heats faster.
2,slow,"I bought this for two main reasons: It was small and held just enough water for two cups of tea, and it was advertised as being faster than a microwave. My microwave can boil 2 cups/16 fl oz of water in 5 minutes, which is faster than this pot. I continue to use my microwave."
5,Convenient and extremely useful,"I bought this teakettle online after searching the stores for something similar. I drink tea several times a day, and my office is a ten minute walk from the cafeteria. This way, I drink tea whenever I want at a fraction of the cost. The water heats up very quickly, and the teakettle never seems too hot to hold. Everyone who sees it wants one of her own.Highly recommended!"
1,Bottom rusts out,"The bottom section is painted steel. After a year of use, the bottom section paint started chipping away from the rusting steel underneath. For something that is used only 15 minutes each day with fresh water only, this is inexcusable. I had to stop using it because the rust started staining my counter. What a piece of junk."
4,"Great Kettle, Great Price","My mother in law turned us on to this kettle - so quick and easy to use. Cord is short, and don't over-fill because it will bubble out the spout, but other than that, it works great, quickly and holds enough for several cups of coffee / tea. Have purchased more than one of these, and they seem to last quite a while. We use ours several times a day so it gets a good work out."
3,Disappointed,"This kettle serves its basic function of boiling water but has some drawbacks: (1) The electric cord is relatively short. (2) If you fill to the ""full"" indicator, the water comes bubbling out the spout when it boils. (3) You can't disbale the whistle. (I stuffed the whistle hole with paper.)"
3,It works Great Price,"I've owned the electric tea kettle for a week now. It was cheap, it works which makes me pretty much like it. I use it 5-6 times through out an average day and when filled to the ""max fill line"" it heats exactly 4 cups of water (measured with a measuring cup)it takes about 5 minutes to heat water to a boil. What I DO NOT like about it is that there is no on/off switch. When you plug it in it automatically starts heating and to shut it off you have to unplug it. It came with no instructions or cautions it was just a tea pot in a box. The cord is also really short at 25 inches in length. For the price it's a good deal but I feel like not having an on/off switch is somewhat of a fire hazard."
4,great kettle,"This is a great little kettle!! Reasonably priced and lightweight and a REAL kettle. I was unable to fing anything like this locally, so thank you Amazon. The only stuff they had locally looked like coffee percolators from the 80""s!!!"
5,Presto 02703 Electric Tea Kettles pirchased at Amazon.com,"I wanted a tea kettle that would last for years and that is what I bought. In addition, they were inexpensive because they were return items. Nothing wrong with them, so I benifited over and above the quality of the kettle. How about that!!I bought two because I want one in reserve--and I could afford to do that because of the price. What I paid for two kettles was less than the cost of one in our local stores. I won with a good product and good price. Happy Holiday for me.I purchased these items at Amazon.com. I will shop Amazon.com again because I found exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price."
5,Low profile and super fast,"The low profile makes this kettle superior to many of the others- there is no danger of knocking it over and it is easy to fill under the faucet. The kettle is superfast, easy to fill with a little notch inside the spout to show the full line and easy to pour. The cord is short but I don't find it a problem. The whistle is great, the water is usually done by the time I have the teapot and tray ready.I also use this teakettle to heat water to pour down my drains to keep them running without the use of chemicals. It is so easy to take this upstairs, fill it, boil the water and pour it down the bathroom sink drain to keep it clear. Before this I had to carry a kettle of boiling water upstairs. There is no on/off switch but that seems to be the way they are making most electric appliances, my grill, waffle maker and panini press are all like that. Buy it on sale, you can't go wrong."
1,"Stay away, returned for a refund","Cute little kettle, but very disappointed with performance. Very slow to heat even a cup of water. You need to fill it up through the small sprout and spill water all over it. Then there is no on and off switch, so you have to plug and unplug it everytime. Finally when the water boils you have to carry the kettle and drag the cable too. No auto off features. Stay away and pay a few more for the Aroma AWK-115S - the number 1 bestselling kettle on Amazon"
1,Does not even get warm,"Although the kettle appears to be completely new and undamaged, and there is nothing at all wrong with my electrical outlets, the kettle does not get even a little bit warm, after half an hour. This was a disappointment, and I will have to return it."
3,Cord is annoying,"If i could do over I'd buy a kettle where the cord is not attached. Everytime i fill it up with water, i have to unplug and drag the cord along. The plus is that it heats up water very quickly"
3,Not amazing,"Didn't expect the whistle to be so loud - it sounds a little like the kettle is about to take off or blow up. Also didn't expect to have to UNPLUG the kettle every time I wanted to shut it and the whistle off. This got really annoying, especially since I would have to plug it back in every time I wanted to use it and would see little sparks whenever the plug went into the outlet. Also, after about 3 years, the kettle started leaking like crazy from the bottom, possibly from where the cord enters the kettle. Now it doesn't even work at all when I plug it in so I've just thrown it out. For the price, I suppose it was worth it, but I won't be buying this model again."
3,okay,"It is an okay product, but no on/off switch so you have to unplug from outlet to shut it off. I also saw some fungus inside the kettle so you really can not leave water just sitting inside of it. There is no access to the inside of the kettle, so cleaning is not an option. Since I like to clean everything and hate fungus, it did not work for me."
3,A decent electric kettle.,"It works great and the whistle is a nice addition. The only downside is there is no on/off switch, you need to unplug it to turn it off.Overall, nothing extraordinary, but nothing bad either. A good deal for the price."
4,Good and handy,The kettle is good and boils water at a short time.The only thing is the capacity is not large. The mouth of the kettle is the only way to enter water. I cannnot see if anything wrong inside.If you use it just for some tea personally. it is a good choice.
1,Not worth it,"Very little informative infomation contained in this article. Just another ""fluff"" piece. I bought the rifle anyway and it is great!"
3,ok,"Their back, why did they release another CD . I feel like I`m back in the 80`s again. Thank you for loving me sounds like old Bon Jovi, good song /but this time around their is no MTV/ to sell their music / oh well their is ALWAYS MTV2/VH1 GOODLUCK? I hope I`m wrong."
3,I only liked two songs on this CD!,"I'm not a huge Bon Jovi fan, but I can agree that some of his music is OK. I like the songs, ""It's My Life"" - though the overplaying of it on the radio has gotten kind of annoying - and ""Thank You For Loving Me"". Two really great songs on one bad CD. My new favorite Bon Jovi song is ""Thank You For Loving Me""; a great ""rock ballad"" and a beautiful song. Those are the only real Bon Jovi songs I recommend and instead of buying this whole album, you should just buy the singles for these two songs - both of which have been released as singles so you will be able to buy both songs as a singles. Other than those two songs, I wouldn't recommend this CD."
3,"Jon Bon Jovi ""THE ACTOR""","Bon Jovi has left the planet to become a movie star, and that he does well. This album is a stab at some of the music that makes today...It's a Miss.....I tried to like it but shades of his yesteryear music just kept coming up in my mind. Wanted Dead or Alive, Blaze of Glory, You give Love a Bad Name, Runaway...That is the Bon Jovi we know and Love...I say his skills as an actor have far surpassed his new music. Please MORE MOVIES JON...."
1,horrible,"Well I have to admit that I was listening to Bon Jovi, but it was in 1992 when I was 7 years old and then I grew up and started listening to real music like U2, REM, Mettalica etc.I listened to this album just of curiousity and felt like having deja vu, I mean this sounds like everything they have ever done and since everything they've done before was the same patern: ""nice melody, catchy chorus and some guitar solo"" this album is really improper. For the last 20 years they haven't evolved a bit and I must agree with some other reviewer that this just a product, to get some money out from the old fans and make some new fans among the kind of ""Britney loving teenagers"""
1,What's Jon doing to his voice?,"Jon's voice is simply irritating on this CD, too twangy. After a while of listening, I simply have to turn it off. In fact, after listening to it a half dozen times, it's on the shelf now to gather dust. Not the band's best endeavor."
2,dissapointin,Ud think after five years theyd come back with quality material ... sadly not its my life and one wild night are barely ok the rest is garbage dissapointin and i thought their first two albums were incredible .. where are those rock anthems shot through the heart etc.....
4,They are back!,"Maybe Heather Locklear has motivated them, but whatever it is, they are as good as ever. They are back with the true rock sound that they were known for in the 80's. One Wild Night and It's My Life are my two favorites so far. If you were a Bon Jovi fan before, you'll enjoy this."
3,Close but no cigar,"There are a couple great songs on ""Crush,"" but there aren't a lot of good ones. The opener ""It's My Life"" was cause for much excitement that Bon Jovi may have stepped out of the enjoyable but wearing glum of ""Keep the Faith"" and ""These Days."" But, too much of ""Crush"" seems meaningless. Songs like ""She's A Mystery"" and ""One Wild Night"" lack whatever fire the band's earlier efforts may have shown.The power ballads are strong. ""Thank You For Loving Me"" is eloquent and simple, sappy while still engaging. ""Save the World"" will probably go over-looked but throws out a sentiment a lot of guys can probably relate to. A couple numbers ""Older"" and ""Next One Hundred Years"" stand out and are noticed but the rest of the album passes by without notice.But, in the end, ""Crush"" seems strangely rushed. Given the amount of time it took to appear that seems odd. It's a total hit and miss ... and misses a few too many times for my tastes."
4,I can't turn it off!,"I wish I had of bought this album earlier. I bought it after going to the concert and I have only taken it out of the CD player at work to put it into the CD player in the car. I'm sure some of the enjoyment I am getting from the CD is due to having seen most of the songs live. But, it is a great CD. I'd almost forgotten how much I really like Bon Jovi. The last time I really listened to them was in high school when I couldn't turn off ""New Jersey"". These are songs that you can listen to again and again and not get tired of them. It's rare that I have a CD where I don't choose at least one song for the CD to skip over, but this is one of them.Definitely worth the money!"
3,Bon Jovi's 80's Sound is a thing of the past,"This is actually a pretty decent album. I was expecting the same kind of melodies as they recorded on such albums as ""Slippery When Wet"" and ""New Jersey"" but they have modernized their sound these days, much to my liking.My reasoning behind the three stars is because this album cannot boast another great song such as ""It's my Life"". Although there are several good ones, none of the rest stand out, such as that one does, when Bon Jovi albums in the past could boast at least 3 or 4 great songs. Even ""Keep the Faith"" had about 3 or 4 great songs. We'll see what develops with this album on radio play, but I don't forsee another radio smash on this album.It's easy listening throughout the album. It's one of those albums you can sit back, kick your shoes off to, and relax. I like those kinds of albums. All in all, it's worth the money."
3,It's Bon Jovi.......But not what I expected.,"I was very excited to hear that Bon Jovi was coming out with a new CD! I had seen the video for ""It's My Life"" and I LOVE THE SONG! So, my expectations were high. I had also heard that the group had gone back to their roots and this album was a lot like ""Slippery When Wet"". Although in my opinion it is not. The songs are good but a bit too slow for me. It could be that they get better with age, but I just don't really see it. I wish I could say better about it. I'd rather buy their greatest hits."
5,Bon Jovi Forever,"The Ultimate Rock and Roll Band rules again! The happy and wild spirit of Bon Jovi shines on this one. Crush has the same intangible joyful essence that made Slippery When Wet awesome. More than most bands, Bon Jovi skillfully reminds us that we are alive, and how great it is to be there. The talent and technical virtuosity of the band only increases over the years! I just hope they don't wait five more years to make the next one!"
4,Welcome back!,"Crush is a good CD-not one of Bon Jovi's best, but definately lighter than ""These Days"". ""It's my Life"" is simple but very catchy and it makes a statement about being independent. My personal favorites are Just Older(about aging without becoming out of date-classic Bon Jovi), Mystery Train(nice, flowing ballad), and One Wild Night(fun, get up and move song). Overall, this is a very fun rock n roll CD worth buying."
5,Bon Jovi is back!,"Bon Jovi made it huge in the mid 1980's with ""Slippery When Wet"" and kept it going through the mid 1990s and then didn't release anything from then on. Now, they have released Crush in 2000 and they have updated there sound without giving up there original sound. this album spawned the top 40 hit ""It's My Life"" which hit 35. The album debuted at 9 which says that Bon Jovi fans are still loyal to them. It sold 2 Million copies. This is a good album and should be a Bon Jovi fan neccessity."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","Finding myself in a sate of desperation for new music, I thought to myself, ""Well, I saw a little piece of the 'It's my Life' video on TRL, maybe I'll try Bon Jovi."" I don't regret my choice, but it wasn't one of my best. The song ""It's My Life"" is rockin' but few other tracks are even half as good. One of my favorite songs is ""Just Older"" and ""Thank You For Loving Me"" is pretty good. The rest of the album is just okay, but nothing stands out. Another important point to make before I go, the first half seems to be much better than the last half, when I got to the final track, I thought perhaps it would pick up again as it sounded pretty good, but it sounded like the rest of the album and was far from novel, the title is ""One Wild Night"" to give you an idea. If I had my twenty bucks back again, would I buy this again? Sure, it's worth it, even if it's not the best."
2,not the bon jovi that i used to known,I grew up listen to bon jovi in the eights. they were the second best best rock band in the eights. but their new cd crush is not good at all. there are only 2 good song on the cd . they are its my life and one wild night. I hope their next cd so a lot better.
2,CRUSHING BLOW,THIS IS NOT A VERY GOOD CD TO SAY THE LEAST WITH LEAST BEING THE OPERATIVE WORD.ONE GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IT`S MY LIFE BUT NOT MUCH ELSE ON HERE TO REMIND YOU OF THE OLD BON JOVI.THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THE CD COVER YELLOW FOR THE LEMON IT IS.BUY THIS IF YOU FEEL LIKE WASTING YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING YOU WILL ONLY PLAY ONCE.
4,Good CD,"Crush is a good effort by Bon Jovi but its by far not their strongest release. There are two rocking tunes on the CD, the first track It's My Life (Which is a great song, one of their Best) and the last track One Wild Life.Tracks 2 through 11 seem to be less Bon Jovi-esque as they range from low tempo Ballad's to mid tempo Beetleish sounding tunes. I'm not saying that they are bad songs,some are actually pretty good, but some of these are not what you would expect when you go back and listen to older rocking tunes like Faith, Runaway and You Give Love a Bad Name.Bottomline, It's a good CD worth picking up....just expect a little change to the Bon Jovi sound that you are used to!!!"
3,I hope this is a helpful review,"It's been five years since Bon Jovi last appeared on the scene, and in that time it's clear the band has been heavily influenced by the current pop sound. Listening to the album one keeps thinking, ""Haven't I heard something like that before?"" Many of the tracks bear a strong resemblance to songs of other artists; for example, the guitar track of Two Story Town sounds very similar to Mellisa Etheridge's hit Angels Will Fall, and the vocals of Say It Isn't So are reminiscent of Tal Bachman. But then again, there isn't much variety in mainstream pop music and despite the fact the album is nothing new, the catchy tunes are sure to get you humming along."
