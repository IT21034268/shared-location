1,Allegic reaction,"First time user. With first application had an allergic reaction with hives for 4 days, only in the areas that product was applied. I do not normally have an allergic reaction to these type of products."
5,This is great!,"I'm only 40 and had no aging issues at all until I started taking prednisone which causes premature aging. My facial issues now are: dry, thinning skin, wrinkles aound the eyes and mouth, and the beginnings of verticle wrinkles on one cheek.When I first purchased this, I used it both day and night for a couple of weeks, then night only. I don't know if I wasn't paying close attention or what, but I really didn't see much of an improvement in my skin; definite softening and the wrinkles didn't seem to be as deep but were still noticably there. So I only used it sporadically at that point, just using my usual moisturizers instead.Last night I noticed that the wrinkles seemed to be deeper again. So I grabbed the jar and smoothed it over my face, adding a bit more to those verticle lines on the one cheek...WOW!! Seriously, they are barely visible today. I know it didn't work like that when I was using it diligently but, for whatever reason, it worked like magic this time!"
2,hmmm,"Either my skin or the product itself kind of rolls off after I apply this. Even after I have exfoliated. Maybe this is the ""regenerating"" part, but I don't care for it. Very strange. I wouldn't buy this again. 2 stars for moisturizing evenly."
2,Hmmmm,"I wanted so badly to love this product. I'm starting to notice some lines on my forehead and on my scowl (lol) line and had high hopes for this cream. It is very moisturizing, but I can not get over the smell! It does make your face feel soft the next morning, but I couldn't use it long enough to notice any changes to my fine lines. I would only purchase again if Olay came out with an unscented version."
3,Very perfumy,"Trying out less expensive products lately; it's pretty good. Burns my face a bit at first, maybe because the high perfume content, but I wake up smooth..."
4,Nightime Repair,Olay Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery helps maintain a great balance of moisture in my skin. My skin feels softer and look so much better each morning. I give this product a big thumbs up.
3,"Works, but I there are hidden consequences","I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad) the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record. I was saddened to find that Olay is still testing on animals. I have been a vegetarian for 12+ years and I guess I have been naive. I believed that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...boy was I wrong!!This cream works good and going through Subscribe & Save this price is unbeatable...unfortunately I will no longer be buying any Olay products because 1) they test on animals and 2) most of the ingredients in their products are ""fillers"", which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream."
1,Not happy,"I'm just rating the product NOT the seller. I received my order very quickly, and was happy about that. I'm just not happy with this Olay. I used it every single night for 6wks, and my skin is still dry, I think it's even more dry than usual especially around my forehead. Also I noticed this product made my skin breakout a lot more. I usually just use the Olay complete lotion, and have always been happy with that. I wanted something that was a bit heavier as a night creme for the dry winter months, and this just wasn't it for me. I ordered a couple different night cremes (not Olay) hopefully I'll have better a experience with them."
2,Not worth the price,"kind of greasy, made my face break out, maybe just me being sensitive to it, but thats my opinion...small jar big price"
3,Not sure,"I really like the daytime serum but I am not sure about this one. I have eczema and rosacea and I have very sensitive skin. I was doing very well, using this lightly under my eyes at night for a couple of weeks. One evening I smoothed it on over my whole face, not too much -- I don't think I used it incorrectly. I broke out in THE WORST rosacea I have ever had on my cheeks. 5 days later and it is still not even close to gone. I don't know for sure if it is this product to blame, but I have not had skin this bad ever. :("
4,great product,"Have noticed my skin's ability to retain moisture has diminished with time. This Olay Regenerist product has truly helped. When I awake in the morning and touch my face, I can feel the difference. And, unlike some of the other Olay products, this has a very pleasant scent. Would recommend it if you're experiencing facial dryness."
2,Made me break out,"I was looking for a light moisturizer to balance my facial scrubbing and cleansing facial washes, the second time I used it I woke up with itchy pinkish little bumps EVERY where on my face (just like many other buyers said), the scent is nice but it's way too strong and the container is TINY considering the price. If you never break out this may work for you, but if you have acne-prone/oily/sensitive skin don't waste your money."
4,Works Great,"The shine is great. It took some work to buff it off with a towel by hand, but it was worth it.No turtles are used in the making of Turtle Wax as mentioned in a previous review. That's just ridiculous."
1,LOTS of work,"As the others have said, it's HARD to buff off this wax. I had Meguiars Tech Wax before buying this, which was excellent. I decided to try this out and save some money--and boy did I regret that decision. It took me forever to wax my car because this wax is just so difficult to buff off. The Tech Wax may be 3x the price of this, but it's well worth it--unless, of course, you really want to build up your shoulder muscles trying to get the Turtle Wax off your car."
1,Short lived shine that is difficult to work with,This stuff is available everywhere for cheap. It is very difficult to work with. Buffing it off creates a huge mess and a lot of effort is required. The shine it provides is pretty good but only lasts about a week at most. After that the water beading properties seem to go away. Spend your money on something from Mothers or Meguiars and you'll be greeted with a longer lasting shine that is easier to work with.
1,Dissapointed,"Hey!! I read the reviews here, but boy were we dissapointed: First of all, the time was very hard to read - very faint. The light was very very dim also. The buttons take quite of bit of effort to make them work - not very smooth, so it is a chore to set. The crystal is elevated, so it is always exposed to be scratched, and I'm always cleaning paint or other stains from it so the kid can see the time. Finally, the bloody thing just froze up and we can't make it work. Just tossed it in the donations bin, and got a hard to find Casio calculator watch that the kid really enjoys and appreciate for checking homework.Casio CA53W-1 Mens Black 8 Digit Calculator with Resin Band Watch"
1,Kids' Size,"This watch appears to be the same as the Nike ""Triax Juniors'/Kids'"" watch. It seems that the seller is just marketing the cheaper kids' watch as a ladies' watch in order to sell it for a higher price."
4,Brilliant CD!,This CD is one of my all time favorites. I have gone through Greatest hits CD x2 ! This one came slowly by mail but I was very happy to get it. It had no scratches and played perfectly. Anybody who loves the 80's like I do must have this in their collection.His Voice is brilliant and the songs are legendary!He is and still is a ground breaking artist especially for the Gay Crowd and people like me who support my Gay friends and Family.
5,Excellent Mahler,Tennstedt is well thought of as a Mahler conductor and he doesnt disappoint here. Both performances deliver on a well produced disc. Suprisingly I find myself reaching for the recently released Haitink DVD's of him conducting Mahler 1&2 which is unusal in the sense that Tennstedt outranks him as a Mahler conductor yet I think I prefer Haitink. Both are worth having and are highly recommended.
3,Hama beads bucket,"I didn't realize this toy doesn't come with any of the ""templates"" that the beads are supposed to be placed on. You have to buy them in addition, I guess."
5,Spirit,Overall this was just great the quality of how it sounds and how it was packed was excellent!
2,Songs are great but sound is bad,"Well, based on what I've read from the other reviews, maybe I just got a bad apple. I do LOVE the songs on this CD, it's just that they all sound like they're coming out of two bad speakers (and they're not). The music sounds a whole lot smoother coming from my Spirit VHS movie. The music from my CD (bought brand-new) has a sort of scratchy sound to it, not just Bryan Adams but the instrumentals as well, no matter how I adjust the sound. Just in case this is how it is supposed to sound, I would advise you to listen to the music before you buy the CD, because to me the soundtrack is a disappointment compared the the music in the movie."
3,Distortion on the CD,I enjoy all of the songs on the soundtrack. The producers must have released a bad batch. My CD has distortion on some of the songs. The distortion is very apparent at the end of Track 1: Here I am.I would have given it a 5 had it not been for this distortion.
5,Best Ever Soundtrack for me,"Ya~ i admit that i am only a young girl who rushed to buy this CD after the day watching ""Spirit"".The songs are simplly too spiritual and comforting, to the music, lyrics and of course, Bryan Adam's soulful voice, especially for ""Homeland"" , ""Sound The Budgle"" and ""Here I am"".I've become a crazy fan of Bryan Adams since this album, and I recommend all fans who loved him 'coz of this album should get a copy of ""Best of Me"",which contains slow and soft songs of him, or ,if you loved rock'n roll, get the album ""Restless""."
5,Spiritual,"I saw the movie when was baby sitting for a friend. It was late and I had to find something to do. The movie was the best I have ever seen. The music was very powerful, nearly bringing a tear to my eye at several points. I immedietly bought the sound track and was delighted with the wonderous works of art that Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer had created together. This music lets the mind wander, it can create a massive, beautiful story if one simply closes their eyes and listens. I would recommend this to anyone who listens to music, even if only occasionaly. In fact I was listening to the soundtrack as I was writing this review."
5,boy are they smart,"i see what they did. they made the movie to be bought for the kids then they used bryan adams to make the soundtrack, knowing that most of the parents of the kids who enjoyed the movie grew up listening to him would love the music. they were right. it worked. the soundtrack is great. it also gives poor mom something else to listen to in the car instead of the ""wheels on the bus go round and round"" or ""pop goes the weasal""seriously, the soundtrack is fabulous. true brayn adams."
4,Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron Soundtrack,Did you like the Movie ' Spirit: Stallion Of the Cimarron'?Well if you liked the songs and themes of Spirit you'll love this beautiful soundtrack.
3,WHERE IS IT?,"the soundtrack is good and all but i want the song from the trailers. some female girl singing, i really love that song! If anyone knows where to find it, the name, singer, or anything about it please make a review about it. I really need to know!"
4,questions?,need 2 no somethin? well ask spirit! im welcome to give u answers on this advice commennt on the movie spirit!_Marie
5,Worth it!,"First of all, let me just say that this is a great album! I love Bryan Adams. I bought it for my daughter who is a huge Spirit fan and it's one of the CDs we actually like listening to together! She's 6.Secondly, this seller was great! No prob, no hassle, straight business and fast. That's the way I like it. Thanks a lot! You made one little birthday girl and mom very happy!"
5,Fantastic,I gave this CD to my friends son who was turning 4 yrs. old. He loved the movie and now he loves the CD and can listen to the songs in the car.
5,This is the BEST Soundtrack I have EVER Heard !!!,"Up until this point, I have considered Bryan Adams ""Robin Hood"" Soundtrack to be one the all-time Top 10 Soundtracks..After listening to the ""Spirit"" Soundtrack, I am proud to add this to my all-time Top 10 list !!!! This music PERFECTLY hits the moods of the movie.. Both happy times and sad times..The 3 best songs are:""You Can't Take Me!!!""""Get Off of my Back!!!""""Sound the Bugle""Buy this album..!!It is a classic...!!!"
3,Its ok,"This soundtrack could have been really great, but they asked Bryan Adams to do it, someone else would have been better, Adams is a bit whiny. But i wont totally rip it apart, its good in a couple respcets includhign the fact that it blends some contemporary music with old school stuff to create a fantastic score"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"This is one hot cd! The music on it is a mixture of slower songs and ones with a more upbeat tempo. When I saw the movie, I thought it was fine, but I immediatly had to purchase the soundtrack ! It is incredible, really showing Bryan Adams' diverse styles of singing! You will not regret purchasing this soundtrack, as it will become a loved family piece...better yet while you're at it buy 2 or 3 of these soundtracks, because you'll listen to this so often the cd will become unreadable from all of the playing scratches!!!"
5,Bryan Adams does it again.....even BETTER!!!!,"Bryan Adams is certainly not new to writing music for motion pictures, however this is his first entire soundtrack. This CD is awesome!!! All of the songs are very uplifting. They put you in a great mood. This CD is awesome for that grueling commute to and from work everyday. It's a great escape!!!! Most of the songs on this CD are ballad type songs except for ""Get Off Of My Back"" which ROCKS!!!!! I can detect a ""Waking Up The Neighbors"" flavor to many of these songs....which is good!!! I think this is the best stuff from Bryan in quite a while. If this si a preview of what Bryan's new stuff is like....I can hardly wait for a new album to come out from him! If your a BA fan this is a must!!! The instrumental songs on this cd by Hans Zimmer are also very beatiful. I highly recommend this cd....you won't be sorry if you get it!!!!I also recommend Bryan Adams ""Unplugged""."
4,So Good That...,"Being a huge Bryan Adams fan since mid 80s, I have mixed feelings on this masterpiece soundtrack in 2002 featuring Canne winning title track HERE I AM. How I rejoiced when I found Bryan name on Billboard when this album came out. And I am glad to encounter great composer Hans Zimmer. I WILL ALWAYS RETURN is Bryan's best style of ballad which is used in two more versions in this album, and GET OFF MY BACK ,classic style uptempo rocker ,is my #1 favorite. It is good for Bryan Adams fans since 90s who love his ballad movie hits but for me it is a bit of frustrating because I still reminisce ""The Summer of 69"" Bryan. I bet he will return with his uptempo rockers that ""Bang The Roof"". Rick Springfield just did that in recent album why not Bryan?Recommended for Bryan Adams, Hans Zimmer fans and soundtrack collectors."
4,Not so bad,"As I didn't expect this CD, I was a little bit surprised at his gooood sounds because his work was more than I expected in this CD. In my opinion, if you were his fan, I think you would not feel losing money for purchasing this CD!"
4,This CD roxs!!,"I bought this CD a while ago and still enjoy it!! Bryan Adams is a good singer and the songs are really meaningful. however; he is the only singer for all the songs, so some may get a little bored with it. I liked it and it's a fun cd to listen to"
4,"Great CD, Poor Condition","My 5 yr old daughter and I love the movie, so I bought the CD to play in the car. We love the soundtrack. This CD was labeled ""Used-Very Good"", but one of the songs wouldn't play. There was a local used video store that buffs out discs for a dollar, so I took it to them. They were able to buff it enough to play, but I shouldn't have had to do that on a ""Very Good"" CD."
5,Bryan Adams SpiritCD Review,"If you are a Bryan Adams fan, you will enjoy this CD. If you saw the movie, way back when, it is a collection of wonderful songs about love and commitment. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Spirit Audio CD,"The music is right from the movie, however I was hoping for more of the instrumental music vs mainly lyrical."
5,beautiful,my mom saw the movie and said she really wanted the soundtrack so i got it for her. she said that the soundtrack was wonderful so i gave it a listen. it was beautiful with each song shining on it`s own. the lyrics are beautiful and sincere. the vocals are outstanding.
5,Great Soundtrack,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I watched it several years ago. I had always thought the music in the film was powerful. I bought the soundtrack to relive the experience while doing homework. I am not disappointed and if you like Hans Zimmer, you cannot go wrong here!"
5,Buy this NOW!,"After I saw the movie, I knew that I had to get this CD... Every song is great on this CD, where can you find that? Some of my favorites are ""Here I Am"", ""Get Off My Back"", & absolute favorite is ""I Will Always Return"".The movie is great, the music is great, everything about this is great! Something about this movie just gives you a lot of hope in otherwise frightful times. This movie and its scores give the listener and viewer something to look to for forgetting the reality that we live in and finding yourself in the old west! Its a feelgood type that wont let you down!Go see the movie and get the CD, you wont be disappointed!"
5,NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN,This wonderful CD and the movie it comes from is the first animated movie and CD that I have truly loved. The music puts it all together and there isn't one song on the whole CD that I do not like. It is a great story and the music tells it all. I couldn't be happier with the CD's or the movie's SPIRIT!
5,some of the best work on any sound track I have ever heard,"When we bought the DVD for our daughter, first thing that jumped out was how incredible the music was. If you like Bryan Adams you will love this regardless if you have even seen the movie."
4,Enjoyable on Its Own,"I've never seen the movie, actually. I bought this CD for the song ""Here I Am,"" which I happened to hear and fall in love with, and I was not disappointed by the other songs when I got the CD. I can listen to this CD from start to finish and enjoy most of the songs."
5,Awsome,I strongly urge anyone who has the slightest Taste for good music to buy this soundtrack. It an absoulute master pieceI admit i had my doubts about this soundtrack but then a friend urged me to get it so i did. I am glad too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
3,WHERE,ITS ANOTHER JOHN CUSACK MOVIE LIKE THE MARTIAN CHILD KIND OF THING HE PLAYS GOOD LIKE HE IS MADEFOR IT I DONT THINK ANY ONE ELS CAN DO THIS MOVIE AS GOOD AS HIMTHIS MOVIE IS FOR EVERY ONE NOTHING BAD ABOUT ITITS LIFE WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY SOME WHERE ITS KIND OF TODAYS LIFE
5,Very happy,Product arrived just as described and the free Pearl Harbor DVD bonus was awesome. I love that movie and I had almost ordered it. Now I don't need to :)
5,John Cusack,"I believe that this is one of John Cusack's best films. I got this movie apprehensively because I had not seen previews but I love Cusack. ""Grace is Gone"" is a wonderful, touching movie that shows the loss and pain that Army families have gone through over the past six or so years. I've recommended it to several friends. I would suggest a box of Kleenex!"
4,"Quiet, tender little drama about loss","If you like quiet, intimate, well-acted dramas, this is the movie for you. John Cusak plays a frumpy, bespectled superstore manager who loses his soldier wife in the Iraq War and can't accept her death. He takes his two young daughters on a road trip to an amusement park, temporarily trying to escape from the horror of reality. Cusak can't bring himself to tell his daughters that their mother is dead, he is so in denial.What I like about the movie is that it shows what the families of the fallen soldiers of the Iraq conflict go through, their pain and suffering. Whenever a soldier dies, everyone who loved him or her is deeply affected, too.Cusak gives one of his most subtle and touching performances of his career and has great chemistry with the actresses who play his daughters, especially Shelan O'Keefe. Their relationship felt very real.Hopefully, Cusak's other Iraq war movie, War, Inc, gets a wider release soon."
2,Grace is Gone DVD Review,I ordered this DVD expecting it to be the same release that can be bought in retail stores. I was surprised to see it was the exclusive release issued to Blockbuster Video which did not contain as many bonus features. I do not remember seeing the Blockbuster release mentioned in the description. I would not have bought it if it was as I wanted the additional bonus feature. DVD condition was great and shipping was quick and fast.
4,"Cusak, again",Underrated as usual. So how would you tell the kids. Is our hero weak? I don't think so. The phone calls to the answering machine are heartbreaking and real. The waste of war.
5,Heartwarming!,"John Cusack is great in this role!Anyone criticizing this movie is heartless. It's a great movie with a warm story!John Cusack plays a dad with two daughters, he finds out that his wife ""Grace"" has just died in Iraq. He is devastated, but doesnt know how to tell his daughters. He takes them on a unforgettable road trip.Great story, Cusack is amazing!"
3,Better than the first!,"Whenever SONY releases a new soundtrack for Dawson's Creek is the same thing: thousands of fans of the TV show start complaining about the song selection, always hoping for some track not included in the compilation. I watch the show since season 1 and I'm surely one of these people I've mentioned. Dawson's Creek soundtrack has become an ""open door"" for new artists and it's a great oportunity for them to show their work to a huge audience devoted to the show. This second volume of the soundtrack is not as disappointing as the first. Again, some important tracks were forgotten --""Don't tell me""(Madonna), ""That I would be good"" (Alanis Morissette), not to mention many others which were part of this show. ""Crazy for this girl"" is a cool track and I believe it will make this CD sell. There are other good tracks, such as ""never saw a blue like that"", ""superman"" and ""If I am""."
3,"i loved the first one, when it came out","but what is up with this one? I really love Train, but where is Counting Crows? they've gotten so much play on the show in the last 2 years, and they don't even show on the soundtrack? ""Mrs. Potter's Lullaby?"" now that I think of it, that's the perfect Pacey or Dawson to Joey song. and Counting Crows are one of Joey Potter's fave bands..."
3,A huge dawson's creek fan,"This is a great cd, with a really nice mixture of songs. I don't own it, i've only heard it once, but that one time was enough for me to want to buy it. The show is brilliant, it's so sad that it's over...there is this one song that they play in the last episode, in the last few minutes. I think it's called ""say goodnight not goodbye"". It is played with a montage of different flashbacks from seasons past. I really love the song, so if anyone knows the name and singer, it would be helpful...i recommend this cd to any dawsons fans"
3,the first disc is alot better,"just keeping it simple, i could not recall hearing most of the songs on this second disc on the tv series. unlike disc one where i could place where i heard almost every song. just like seasons 5-6 of the series, id skip this volume #2 of the music.."
3,"Not All good but the ones that are, are great!","I really only like 4 of thesp songs on this CD....Crazy for this girl, if I am, superman and teenage dirtbag. But I would buy thevwhole CD just for these 4 songs because they rock!!"
4,Soundtrack,"I primarily bought this because of the song ""Blue"" by Shawn Colvin that doesn't seem to be on any of her CDs. Overall it's a good soundtrack."
4,New Zealand artists make this album.,"The New Zealand version of this cd is by far the best. I bought the cd for Mary Beth Maziarz's ""Daydream Believer"" track which played during one of the best scenes in the series. I didn't know that there were going to be songs from my fellow New Zealanders on the cd, but their songs far out-strip the talent of the rest. Stellar*'s ""Every Girl"" is about the weakest song on their own album but supports this soundtrack nicely. The rockier ""Don't Stop the Revolution"" by Breathe adds another element. I hope to hear more New Zealand artists in the future episodes, Bic Runga or Zed - one of the top Kiwi bands (just recently signed to Eminim's recording label) would be an awesome start, watch out for their debut album.Where was Madonna's ""Don't Tell Me""?Note: Do not confuse New Zealand artists with the Australian's!!"
5,one of the best blues albums I own!!!,"I am so happy that I bought this album, Buddy guy and Memphis mix it up so very well in this classic recording. You will be hooked from the first time you listen to this. I hope I can find more material by these two together, they sound like they have been playing together for years.Enjoy!"
3,Naked eye more sensitive to ambient light,"Small easy to use, but my eyes once adjusted to low light, are much better. IR mode is pretty much like using a dull flashlight and the IR LED's are visible to others."
4,ok,The books are different and better than the movie. The movie was realy had a different ending. If I was You I would read the 1-3 books on the series of unfourtunate events
2,Boring,"While the readers of the celebrated series of books may enjoy this film, to someone who has not enjoyed the pleasure, this is an increaisngly boring film. By the end, nothing, absoluetly nothing had happened. The parents disapper or die, the kids get carted around and the villian escapes (and he alternitive motive is never revealed). The story of the littlest elf would have been more entertaining.The acting itself is fine and the costumes captivating, but the actual storyline...like I said."
4,Good Movie-Not so good book representation,"I saw this movie in the theatres, and was the only one in my family who I saw it with that had read the books. I absolutely love the books, the villainy in it is very well written. I also think that Jim Carry is perfect as Count Olaf. What upset me about the bad representation of the book is that the order was totally changed. I just recently re-read the books with my little brother, and I realised how much they had missed or changed in the books. I was really upset that the orphans went back with Count Olaf after being with Aunt Josephine because in the book it wasn't that way at all. This changed the flow of the entire movie, and showed that the books were much better. My recommendation is that if another one comes out that you read the books first so that you can really get the most out of the movie. You will be able to enjoy it or hate it much more if you know what was really supposed to happen."
5,Paramount Blows the top off the money vault due to Lemony Sn,"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unforunate Events is a great movie, in fact I think it is the best movie I've ever seen in my lifetime. Daniel Handler (Snicket) did a good job making this movie. And Jim Carrey did a soaptacular job. So did Emily Browning and Jude Law. Altogeter I say see it.With all due respect,Lisa Fish**rn"
5,Superb!,"This movie was amazing! The acting was awesome and Jim Carrey played the role of Count Olaf perfectly, he didn't overdo it at all. As one reviewer said when Carrey was on screen he acted like a child saying, ""Look at me, look at me!"", well he does this because that's how Count Olaf is, he turns all attention to him. The soundtrack is amazing as well as the sets and costumes. It's amazing and well adapted to the first three books of the Lemony Snicket series. A DEFINATE MUST SEE!"
4,"Boy, Was I Surprised!","I wasn't overly anxious to see this movie. When I seen the previews to it, it just didn't appeal to me. BUT my oldest daughter was dying to see it so we rented it. This is a REALLY good movie. Very creative and it keeps you interested from beginning to end. Jim Carey is a comedic genius!"
2,"A dull, dissapointing movie for all!!","When I heard about this movie, I thought this movie was going to be awesome. I was dissappointed because I read the books and it did not follow it at all. Bottom line: Gigli 2, Special thanks to Benifer and Martin Breast for helping. I hated this movie and if you liked the books, you'll hate the movie, if you hated the books or have never read them, you might think the movie has its moments. By the way, Emily Browning(Violet) is hot!!"
3,Jim Carrey at his Manic Best,"I've never read the books, but I found this movie to be quite entertaining in a dreary, Tim Burton-esque way. What really makes this movie worth watching is Jim Carrey. He is absolutely brilliant as the self-absorbed, cunningly evil Count Olaf. All I can say is, there was nothing funnier than watching his interpretation of a squealing dinosaur. That alone made the movie worth watching."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER¡!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the absolute worst movie ever. I myself read the whole series but his juzt completely starayed away from the whole idsa of the book, if you really want to be didappinted READ THE BOOKs!! He bookz are amZinv i loved hem"
1,So dissapointed!,Copy arrived it was a gift. Our nieces favorite movie. Not secure in the box and bounced all over. Sad to say it has scratches and doesn't play. Had to return it by end of the week however since our daughter had a baby our schedule dint leave room to run to ups. A complete disaster!
2,"Two stars for the whole, but none for Carey !","Movie far too dark for children to enjoy, I believe. The main characters, a fourteen years old girl, a twelve years old boy and a two years old baby girl are, indeed, adorable and act honestly, as well as the other players, except for Jim Carey, who tries in vain to steal all the success from them using his endless stock of grins and buffooneries. While he should represent an excentric character he does not offer any memorable performance. He does not play, he acts ham. His make-up, supposed to transform him physically, clears out, wiped away by his too well known clowneries and we do not see the Count Olaf who he is supposed to perform, but just Jim Carey, equal to himself."
3,Not impressed,I guess you had to read the book/s to like this...then again my husband has and he didn't care for this movie. There is worse than this out there I am sure.Rent this if there is nothing else to see!!!
3,Don't Judge the Books by the Movie,"Sorry, I know I see a lot of praise for this movie... But I have read Lemony Snicket's book since the first one came out and I gotta say I highly disappointed in the movie... It didnt seem to follow the story line of the book at all the whole thing was just overly done and made to be too much on the humour side... I am sure if it was a movie on its on and wasnt based on books that I love i might have liked it more.. I was just highly disappointed... Please if you saw the movie and thought it was bad just dont like that stop you from reading the books... they are so much better and gloomier"
2,It was very much like Big Fish.....,"I had a really though time getting into this movie it felt like every other scene it was ok, then it would get strange and odd. I am a Jim Carrey fan, but it was almost too odd for me. It was a really nice ""looking "" movie, they has wonderful costumes, and sets. This movie kept the same feel from start to end. It was just really though to get into.. But I had the same problem with ""big Fish"" Just not my type of movie."
4,Very cute movie,"I saw this at the theater and loved it, and now own it on DVD. The sound and picture on this DVD are excellent. Here is another movie that is wonderful for kids (and kids at heart). Well worth your time."
3,Probably More Enjoyable if You Didn't Love the Books,"The movie was most likely a good and creative movie. For those who absolutely loved the books and the characters portrayed in them, you lost a lot when it went to film. You don't develop the connection you did with the children's guardians and you hardly get to know them or the real usefullness of the children's talents. As for my favorite, Sunny, the meaning of all her words were translated into insults more than her charming and very intelligent comments. It was also a bit out of order and unfortunate events were both added and deleted. This however is the opinion of someone who really enjoys the books and was very disappointed in the film."
4,A Fun Movie,"I've never read any of the Lemony Snicket books, though after having see this movie, now, have ordered the entire lot thru Amazon. I had wanted to see this movie upon seeing the previews on tv and at the theatre.. Jim Carrey promised to be over-the-top and funny, and he delivered. I believe this was a fun movie, entertaining at face value, regardless of whether or not one has read any of the books from which this was adapted. Having not known anything about the characters or the plot, it didn't factor in to how much I enjoyed the film. It was a playful, sometimes dark and morbid jaunt of fun.. to pass the time.. I was entertained.. I now look forward to reading the books."
4,one of my top 5 faveorite movies of 2004,it kind of goes from book to book. they start out with one then skip some and go to 2 but it comes back to one later.but still a really great movie! and i can not wait until it comes out on dvd on April 26 2005 it is a must see and also has kind of a happier ending than i pictured.and thats why it is one of my top 5 of '04 and it keeps you on the edge of you'r seat.if i were to give it a grade i would give it an A and i would give raise your voice an A plus.
3,Not a classic,"A solid movie. Entertaining. Some good characters (though this isn't Jim Carrey's greatest moment). I found the ending disappointing & abrupt & left feeling a bit let down. Someone told me this was a Tim Burton-esque movie, but it doesn't reach his standard."
1,Absolutely the worst movie ever,"I bought this movie at Wal-Mart today. It is so bad that I am returning it tomorrow for a refund because it is so awful. The only other movie I've returned in that manner was 'Dick Tracy,' because of Madonna, and that's saying a lot. 'Unfortunate Events' has no plot, virtually no story line, and it's hard to imagine that stars such as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman appear in it. They are unbelievably out of place, so it had to be money, of course. I cannot recommend this movie for anyone, for any time, for any place."
4,"Good, but not as good as the books","I think that this movie will be great. However, I only give it four stars because movies are never as good as the books. So, I recommend reading the books before seeing the movie if you haven't already. I am a little worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (after all, Olaf is supposed to be pure evil), and for some reason Klaus does not appear to have glasses in the trailer. I think the movie will be great and I am looking forward to seeing it!"
1,absolutely horrid film,This is by far one of the absolute WORST movies I have ever seen in my life! I would not take my children to see this movie. Within twenty minutes of the movie starting I wanted to leave the theater. It took everything in me not to fall asleep I was so completely bored and not impressed with any aspect of this film whatsoever! Do not waste your money on this film. You will regret it.
1,REALLY VIOLENT,"WHAT WAS PARAMOUNT PICTURES THINKING? THIS FILM AMOST WENT STRIGHT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HILL. THE ACTING WAS VIOAL, COUNT OLAF'S CAMEO WAS HORIBLE. THIS WAS SO SCARY THAT IT ALMOST GAVE ME NIGHTMARES. I AMIT IT TO BE FUNNY. BUT, IT IS JUST PLAIN SICK."
1,Boring!!,"I didn't like this movie. I don't think it should be classified as a children's movie. Although there is no explicit violence, the whole movie is about death. Further more in my opinion the movie was slow and quite boring in many parts. Although it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, I would definitely not watch it again."
4,an actor acting for mony,the movie is about three children whose prants have just died in a fire. the oldest child is a girl named violet baudelare she is an inventor. the middle child is a boy named klaus baudelaire he loves to read books .the third child is a baby gril named sunny and she likes to bit things. after thir parents died they are sent to live with thir distant ncle count olaf.
2,I fell asleep....,"This movie had so much potential. But, the ""sparkle"" just wasn't there. I ended up falling asleep halfway through it from the boredom of it. I was very surprised that this movie held some many kids' attention in the theater. It was so ""Victorian"" feeling, and so adult-oriented, to hold attention spans longer than 2 seconds. This movie could have been so much better. Read the books...skip the movie."
5,a wonderful movie based on lemony snikets books!!!!,"LEMONY SNIKETS A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS is a funny,well done movie for all ages.once agian,its about three orphans going to a gurdians house.charecters:VILOET:a cunning teen girl that whenever,she puts a ribboin on her head, that means she is thinking an invention, KLUAS:a intellagent boy who likes reading,SUNNY:an infat who likes to bite,COUNT OLAF:a villan who wants to steal the orphans fortunate,MR.POE:a man who cougs a lot,UNCLE MONTY:a kindhearted man;but something happens to him,OLAFS TROUP:a evil,funny kind of way,CAPTIN SHAM:DISGUISED AS COUNT OLAF,STEPHANO,ALSO DISGUISED AS COUBT OLAF,and of course the funny,AUNT JOSAPHINE:a silly,(always worried)woman.i so want it on DVD WIDSCREEN!altogether it was a good movie!!!!!"
3,"quirky kids' flick that works, but nothing much new in it","I am not a Jim Carrey fan - he thinks he's too cute - so I was not particularly enthused with the prospect of watching this film. I nonetheless got a copy for my kids and they greatly enjoyed it, to to point that I was glad I got it for them. To be honest, it did not do all that much for me as an adult who is a bit tired of weird kids' films, but it did have many original twists and the acting, including Carrey, is uniformly strong.The kids are the best, particularly the baby who speaks in baby tongue that is translated for wonderful comic effect. The straight son also does a good job, a mix of action and thinking, a good sidekick for his sister of genius, the inventor. Newly orphaned, they are attacked by their evil relation, who is equally inventive as he tries to get them and very funny in his frustration at being foiled repeatedly.REcommended for kids. This is fun, but it is personal taste as tho whether adults will like this."
1,BEST BOOK -WORST MOVIE,"This is my very short reveiew. If you liked the movie GET IT. If you disliked it, like me, don't buy the movie buy the book(s). I personaly LOVED the books and just thought Jim Carrey was too much in this film."
5,MUST WATCH MOVIE!MUST WATCH MOVIE!,I so want to watch the movie!I have read all of them except the 4th.Lemony Snicket rocks!Hope that Jim Carrey isnt 2 lite 4 Count Olaf.If they put all 11 books in it it would be better except longer.BRING ON THE MOVIE!I will see you in the ticket line on December 17!14 DAYS LEFT
3,Unfortunate for Snicket fans.,"Being a Lemony Snicket fan my self, I found this movie dissipointying. It did not do justice to the books humor and even the story it self. The movie is not nearly as funny as the books and sometimes lacks a sense of being related to the books. Snicket's way of telling the story has been erased and the actors for Klause and Vilote don't do te charactors justice. If you are a fan of the books I would recomend that you watch something else that is less unfortunate."
3,It's all about Jim.,"Unfortunately for those of us who have read the books, the fact that the film is all about Jim Carrey is a bad thing. The books are all about three industrious and unlucky children. Liam Aiken, who happens to be in my opinion a fine young actor, is hardly given a chance to peform in this film - his, and his young co-stars'- role(s) relegated to reacting to whatever Big Bad Jim throws their way for the most part.It's unfortunate - the direct of this film has several other's that I completely enjoyed, and I expected better from him with regards to the storytelling - instead, we're treated to another Hollywood Formula script and a film that could have been, but isn't, excellent"
5,Warning-you might want to consider a tame fairy-tale instead,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this in a theater a few months ago - I had not read the books. I liked it enough to see it again in the theater, buy the DVD, and read one of the books. I happened to come across a later book in the series, not covered in the movie, and found I was right at home with the characters and the tone of the movie and books are a perfect match.If you like wry humor, sometimes bordering on pathos, in a gothic atmosphere, this movie should be right up your alley. The children are put through one gloomy predicamant after another, but always rise to the challenge. Jim Carey is perfect as the multi-faceted villain. But if you're afraid of danger, gloom and doom, you'd better look for a Smurf's movie or something."
4,A Series of Loose Plot Consistency,"I am a reader of the Series of Unforunate Events, and saw the movie yesterday. Although the movie is generally a fun film, it severely lacks coherence to the plot. The sequence of events is jumbled when the wedding scene is placed at the end of the movie rather than at the end of 'The Bad Beginning,' and the children are not supposed to learn about VFD until 'The Austere Academy.' Furthermore, Klaus is supposed to have glasses, which is absolutely ESSENTIAL for 'The Miserable Mill,' and Mr. Poe is supposed to have a persistant cough that never seems to get any better. The most deviant thing of all is that Olaf is CAUGHT!!! He is NEVER caught in ANY of the books. In conclusion, the acting, visual effects, and other elements were great. And, the scene with the letter from their parents at the end even made me cry. But, if you want a movie based on a book series that has a consistent plot, look elsewhere."
4,ITS GREAT !!!! but I don't like some things - _-,"I loved the actors in the movie of the UNFORTUNATE EVENTS !!!Almost all the characters were as I imagined and even the settings were fabulous and creative. Jim Carey was the right person to pick for a vile evil person named Count Olaf.But some of the parts were different from the book. So if you read the three books called THE BAD BEGINING , THE REPTILE ROOM and THE WIDE WINDOW you might not like the movie because of some changes. I hope you like the movie !!!!!"
2,Doesn't quite gel!!,"Jim Carrey's performance stands out in this mediocre tail based on the series of children's books by the author pinned under the psedonym, Lemony Snicket. It's not fair to judge the movie on how the book were written. With that said, the movie is original. The visuals are stunning and the plot quite intriguing. However, I found the children to be uninteresting and rather annoying. Meryl Streep was wasted in her role as the nervous aunt. Overall, it was a great idea that just couldn't find itself. Hopefully, the sequel will be better."
4,Carrey is a genius!,"No seriously, Jim Carrey seems to be able to play just about any character type out there and come off appearing believable! Big Carrey fan. As for this movie itself: nice transitions from scene to scene, however the storyline is about the same as any movie created from books worth reading. The books provide a lot more information, but all in all the movie is good for a chuckle or two."
3,the great reviewer to tell you about series of unfortune events,the series of unfortune events is a good movie.But Jim Carry is disapointing.To me cause if you read the first three books there Count Olaf is evil.But Jim he is more of a funny person.I was looking for a more serious man.But still that should not have stoped you from buying it.But every one else was great at acting.It was good and if you buy it I am sure you will not be disapointed I am sure of it!!!!!!
2,good but more details!!!,I thought this movie was good but I had read all the books and they could have added more details to the movie to make it more interesting. It was only like 10 minutes during the movie and I started getting bored. I thought the movie would be better than that because the books are very good. If you like reading you should check out the books because they are a whole lot better than this movie. But if I was you I would find something else to watch.
2,What happened to the books in this movie??,"I don't know what happened, but this movie was all over the place. It is supposed to be about the first three books, but so much was left out that it left you wondering ""WHY DID THEY MAKE THIS MOVIE IF THEY WERE GOING TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING???"" And, where it did keep in line with the story, the characters were doing things that other characters did and some of the characters from the book were not even in the movie, like the fat man/woman whom I so wanted to see.Another disappointing area was that it made up ""unfortunate events"" as if the books didn't have enough, and it totally changed everything around, like ending the movie with parts from book one.If you haven't read the books and don't plan on reading them, then by all means purchase the movie. However, the books are more entertaining and leave you wanting more. The movie just leaves you."
2,"Could have been -- and should have been -- much, much better","When the book is first-rate, you worry about the movie. Here, the film seems to cover roughly the first three (of thirteen) volumes, and I think they should have waited and tried to cover them all in one better edited film. There's no indication that there will be a sequel, but the plot doesn't end -- it simply stops. Anyone who hasn't read the book(s) is going to be mightily confused and thoroughly irritated. On the theatrical side, the kid actors are wooden and the whole thing becomes a vehicle for Jim Carey -- and it's not supposed to be his story! I'm told the script was supposed to be written by Daniel Handler -- the actual author of the actual books -- but he was fired -- to be replaced by Robert Gordon, who wrote the script for _Galaxy Quest_. I rest my case."
3,The books are better,"As is often the case, the book was much better than the movie.I just saw this film for the first time this weekend. Of course, I read the books first. I was saddened and surprised that the movie was so loosely based on the original books. The movie was fun and I'm sure kids will enjoy it, but it lacks the enchantment that's in the books.I'm giving it 3 stars - mainly for the great acting, especially from Jim Carrey, and for the colorful and visually appealing sets/backdrops. Too bad they didn't focus more on the script."
3,Much Intended For Children To Enjoy.,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unforntunate Events is an elaborate children's movie that has very little appeal to grownups. I could think of Big Fish to compare to this family movie. The sets, costumes, and visual effects are very good here. The three kids are great, especially the adorable infant. I was disappointed that Meryl Streep(Aunt Josephine) was underexposed, and it's nice to see her in a cartoonish performance. Was it neccessary for the participation of Dustin Hoffman's cameo role? Jim Carrey is very impressive playing multiple roles of villian. I think the reason that this movie didn't click with me was because I haven't read the books and unfamiliar with it to follow it. Or is it because this film is really designated for kids only?"
4,GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LEMONY SNIKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS IS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE!!!!I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT GOES TO DVD!!!!!!!!I WANT THIS MOVIE TO BE 4 STARES BECUASE THE THEATER EDITION AND THE DVD EDITION IS JUST NOT EQUAL.THEY SHOULD BE BOTH 4 STARES!!!!!!!!WELL,BYE!!!!!!!!A MUST-SEE MOVIE!!!!!!"
5,GOOD MOVIE,I think that it was a great movie. The beggining was stupid. But the rest of the moie was great. It didnt really follow the books.Like it skiped the part where Violet invented the signeling device insted they waved to get the boat.
3,"Do I hear ""Oscar?""",This movie rocked my socks off!..Jim Carrey is sOooOOOOo dreamy and by the way..Meryl Streep is HOT!..this movie was exactly like reading the book..it's so accurate it would be a bullseye in a game of darts..when the movie was done everyone in the movie theatre was clapping and I admit..I had a tear in my eye..the special effects were sO aMazing that I thought I was in the movie for a second..if i could I would give this movie 6 starz..go SEE this movie and if you think it suckz..give me a call!
2,Terrible!,"I should have known that I would not like this movie. I really hated the books. I think you have to enjoy the books to enjoy the movie, becaue a friend of mine loved the movie and the books. I can say Harry Potter and other kids movies have set the bar to high for me. This movie was just blah compared to those other kid movies out now. And sadly the most interesting part of the movie was getting rid of Olaf and finding out how their parents died.Yep, it is unfortunate but also boring and not well made."
3,Not as well done as the books,"The books, I believe, were much better than the movie. Klaus, (this is the worst part), doesn't even wear glasses! You only see him wearing them in one TINY part of the movie, and it's only for a few seconds when he is being introduced to the movie-viewers. This is a poor movie release of the books, and I wish it could be better. But a series of unfortunate events are really good books, and I believe they covered the story well enough. One other thing--everything was all over the place! Count Olaf decided to marry Violet at the end of all three books--NOT TRUE! They mixed it all up, and that eye looking-glass thing, that sends light and burns up the marriage document--what's up with THAT?"
3,DVD Extras,"I'll leave the review of the ""main"" movie to those more qualified or at least more familiar with the source material. Suffice it to say, as a novice to the material, I rather enjoyed it. Hence the 3 stars. However, this is just a warning to those who might be interested in watching the ""extras"". The Sun does NOT in point of fact, rise and set in Jim Carrey's rear end. Nor does the Earth revolve around him. I can see where you might get that impression as all of the extras that I managed to watch centered on Carrey and his ""art"". This is not to say that Carrey isn't talented or that he does a bad job of this movie. But Good Grief! It's like he's the only one involved in the entire film! The only one I didn't finish was the director's commentary because once they started waxing rhapsodic about He-Who-Has-Been-Named-Far-Too-Much, I shut it off before my head exploded."
2,"Hardly great, but worth seeing once, unless it's your vibe..","Then you'll probably want to watch it over and over. I'd never even heard of the books, the title, the characters, etc., and I still could care less about any of that. Jim Carrey does a decent job, but he's done better drama, and certainly done better comedy (LIAR LIAR being his funniest in my opinion), and the production design shines, but only the super young and those of you into this kind of thing would take the time to see this more than once."
2,Unfortunate? You Bet!,"Of course, such a popular book had to be made into a ""hit""movie and video game. I wasn't at all surprised at the poor quality of this movie, after seeing the commmercial. Devoted fans of the series will find themselves shocked as they see a movie wiith hardly anything in common with their favorite books. In the movie, the plot is: after recieving the distressing news that their parents have perished in a fire, the Baudelaire orphans live with Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately, Count Olaf tries placing them in front of a moving train, and the children move to live with their Uncle Monty. But, disguised as a lab assistant, Olaf finds them again. The same thing happens at their Aunt Josephene's. I was dissapointed because of the innacurate portrayal of the books. Also, Jim Carrey was awful. He's too dramatic to be Count Olaf. In closing: this movie has its moments, but they are few and far between."
2,This movie was ahhh...not so good.,"Yeah I had highly anticipated seeing this movie for a long time. I would see the preview on the t.v. and get pumped because the release date got ever closer. When I finally made it to the movie though, it was absolutely terrible. First off, they made this little 2 year old kid do all of these stupid noised and make the comments that were not even funny at all, stupid. Then Jim Carrey really didn't have very much comedy in it either. It was just a really dark movie, really lame comedy, which inturn turned into a really lame movie. Let's just face it, I could have paid my 8:50 to a charity, the money would have went to a lot, lot better cause than this movie!"
2,Gloom and Doom,Did this movie really need to be so grim? couldnt the children share a few smiles? This was an extremely depressing movie for both Mom and five year old. Don't waste your time. LIfe is too short.
1,Bad Moive Review,"This is what my daughter, who has read all the books has to say about the movie...I was exiced to see this moivie. I read the books and I was so sad after seeing this moivie. The first book was rearranged, the scecond was too short, and third you left out a lot of information. So I think they wanted to make 5 bad movies than 11 good ones. (fyi there are 11 books, so far) I think the movie should be rated r for rotten. Maybe the actors were good.(maybe) This should be rated 0 stars."
1,Being Generous Also,My grandaughter and I have read the books and really enjoyed them. This movie is absolutley horrible. I have read some of the reviews and agree with them about Jim Carey's absolutley atrocious portrayal of Count Olaf. Granted I don't much care for Count Olaf but this was a ridiculous portrayal. Read the books and forget this poor excuse of a movie based on some really cute but wierd books.
1,I'm being generous,"Some people say that Jim Carrey's performance is ""a little over the top"". It's more like a psychopathic tantrum in the extreme. He almost single-handedly ruined the movie, although this couldn't have been that hard to do since the direction was ghastly. After all, it's ultimately the director's fault for allowing Carrey to wallow in absurdiity.The children are too contemporary in their speech and demeanors. They have no charm. The youngest child, Sunny (the biter) is right out of a Stephen King corn field - scary.Set designs in the movie are ridiculous and ugly.The music was fairly decent - so what?Overall, the movie plays as a surreal nightmare. It is poorly done from beginning to end. I have read the books, and although they are pretty odd, too, this movie could have taken the best from the books and made something watchable.Do not allow your young children to watch this bizarre, nonsensical movie. It is a hideous, disgusting, self-indulgent mess."
1,One of the Worst Films I have ever Seen !!!!!!!!,"This is basically a story of 3 orphans that get treated lack crap for 2 hours with an ""overacting"" uncle trying to bump them off to get their money......That's it!...Period!...Nothing like watching a flick like this at Christmas to make you feel good!Booooooo!!!!!!!"
1,I Don't Get It,"I never understood this movie. Now the part that really bugs me is the intro that is supossed to be a movie called ""The Happy Little Elf"" then after a little bit of junk, Lemony Snicket comes in and tells that the movie is begining. The character who shocks me is Count Olaf. 2 films I don't understand this and The Spiderwick Chronicles. So unless your into the books, get this movie, if not, then don't."
3,Widescreen?,"Did anyone else who bought this Edition notice that although it is described on the box as ""Widescreen format, the black lines on the top and bottom of the screen are normal"" in fact there are no black lines - I deliberately bought a widescreen version but this appears not to be what it says - perhaps it is ""Anamorphic Widescreen"" but why not say so. Disappointed."
2,Count Olaf as comic relief?!?!?!?!?,"okay, this movie is good as a stand-alone,when compared to the books,noCount Olaf is a REALLY evil dude in the books,he's not funny at all,yet he dishes out most of the movie's laughs. I know this is a children's book series, but the books' story was never funny,but since the movie is based on a children's series,it has to be a children's movie,so it can't be dark or depressing. And better yet, get NICK to do it,yeah...thanks.That train scene,never happened in the books......but I guess they had to add it because the 1st book's ending is the movie's ending!!!!!! What the heck?????? something impossible for fans of the series to not notice.And whats with this 'spyglasses"" thing? trying to add some new plot line to a movie? when there won't be a sequel,and it's not in the books?!!?!? GENIUS!!!Maybe if Nick didn't get their hands on this movie it would have been different...."
2,Don't go unless you're under 10,"You won't want to see this movie unless you are, say, pre-teen. Trust me. The theater where we went was filled with little kids, maybe around 10 years old. The older teens whom I took said Jim Carrie was not funny, they actually said nothing in the movie was funny. For me, at age 50, I found the movie un-involving, something you look at but don't participate in. Yes, the movie did have a peculiar LoOK. To me that's a plus. But it is not enough to carry the film. Here's an example of the films humor. Brother and sister have a baby sibling, too young to talk. But she makes noises and apparently the filmmaker talks baby talk. So baby sounds off, and across the bottom of the screen we see her translated, ""Bite me."" At this, the ten year olds throughout the theater laugh."
2,I Didn't Like It,"Wowee. Why did Lemony Snicket even bother to write the books? I'M SURE IT WASN'T SO SOME IDIOT COULD COME AND DESTROY THEM. This is achieved quite well in A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Movie. Here are just a few errors that I've found in the movie.1) The spy glasses. Spy glasses? If Lemony Snicket didn't write it, I don't see it's need to be there2) In the books, Aunt Josephine admits to having eaten the bannana much sooner, and expresses her concerns about the leeches to the children. This is consistent to her character. In the movie, however, she eats the bannana on the boat. Tell me something: Would a woman who won't turn on the stove for fear it might burst into flames eat a bannana in the middle of leech infested waters? NO. She would not.Lemony Snicket sold out to have his work destroyed."
2,What Happened?,"The first three books were my favorite of the series. I saw the movie the day after it came out and it was not what I expected. The wedding was at the very end of the movie. The part where the Baudelire children convince Aunt Josefina electric appliances were fine was skipped. They should not have combined the first three books into one movie. There is an elf in the start of the movie. The elf is in other scenes and it is not in any books. Uncle Monty said he needed an inventor,a reader, and a biter to help him build the cage for the snake in the book. In the movie they never build the cage even though he adresses that part. I thought it was rushed and left to much stuff out. It was not as true to the books as I expected."
3,From someone who hasn't read the books...,"As always, Jim Carrey is perhaps the best part of this film. Personally, I found it to be odd, somewhat boring, and filled with certain things someone like myself could no understand. It was pretty funny, don't get me wrong, but I don't see what everyone is so thrilled about. I think you would have to have read the books to truly enjoy this film."
3,I guess I have to read the books...,"I have seen this movie twice but never read the books, so the movie made no sense.In the first part of the movie the children move in with Count Olaf and are told not to go into the tower, then they never discuss it again. It wasn't until I saw the movie a second time that it dawned on me that the tower must have been where the large magnifying glass was that burned down the Bouldadire's house; but then why did Klause use an old umbrella like a batman grapling hook and scale the outside of the building to rescue Sunny, why didn't he just go inside and run up the stairs? It would have been easier. And where was the guard Count Olaf was talking to on the walkie talkie? When Klause got to the top nobody was there guarding Sunny's cage as we were lead to believe.Okay, enough complaining. I'm off to read the books! Hopefully it will answer a few questions."
5,interesting movie,I bought this movie for my kids and I am amazed to say I'm actually able to watch it with them. This movie is also interesting for adults and is a fun movie.Overall I am very happy with it.
2,Zzzzzzzzz.....,"Zzzzzzzzz..... I'm pretty certain even the most zombified of DVD-drugged kiddies would eventually get bored with this non-stop, in-your-face Jim Carey parade. The magical sets and special effects were decent, but expected; all the overblown CG stuff is getting tiresome. The real problem with this Harry Potter Lite project is the lack of any real intrigue in the story and the constant scenery chewing by Carey. Hiring a no-name for the star would have been a better bet. I was expecting clever and quick, but every ""event"" ended in very rote fashion with a unfortunate lack of wows or oohs. The kid actors were cute and enjoyable whenever Carey allowed them time to chime in."
2,Way Off...,"I was expecting this movie to be much better than a 2 star review. The character casting is ok... Klaus wasnt supposed to be taller than Violet, but other than that, the casting was allright. The movie is entirely out of order, im not going to give anything away, but if you have read the books and you see the movie you will see that the movie has scrambled the 3 books into a messed up order. There were also so many missing scenes, and many added scenes that had nothing to do with the book. Hint Hint... Train Scene... All in all i would never see this movie again, and dont reccomend anyone else seeing it, unless you havnt read the books, or dont care if it is completely out of order."
2,dull...C+,"We were bored by this film, and so was the rest of the audience in the theatre. When the movie ended, no one said 'wow, what a great film.' No one in the audience chatted happily about his or her favorite character, nor did anyone rehash a favorite scene.Yes, a series of unfortunate events befalls the children, but we just don't care. The movie never grabs our heartstrings. To their credit, all the actors do a good job, from the baby & teenagers through all the adult performances. But there is just something missing from this film."
3,A special need!,I needed this for a special purpose and the music is very soothing. It helps me get to sleep when I am tense.
3,I know one day the lid will fall off.,This is a good compass. I just has one problem the lid hinge will break. The compass will still work and I'll be able to take the compass out of the chase and still use it along with the mirror in the lid.
4,Tasteful indeed...,"Whithout getting lost in electronica,the M People broke the sophomore jinx and and got everybody's booty grooving with inspiration,rhytm,harmony and taste."
2,very uneven,"First off, this is not really a history of conversation, as most of the narrative is focused on 18th and 19th century England, the author's specialty. Nonetheless, the book contains enough general historical background, anecdotes and insight to make it worth reading (even though I really had to struggle to get past the central chapters). Miller seems to be ambivalent about modern technology's effect on conversation, and lists several of what he calls Conversation Avoidance Devices. While an iPod certainly does fall into this category (then again, do we really want to be conversing all the time with everyone who happens to stand nearby?), the Internet does not, as chat rooms, blogs, email etc. obviously open up different ways to do conversation -- ways that the author does not seem to appreciate or enjoy as much as a personal interaction at the coffee house. But why do the two have to be mutually exclusive?"
3,Research Paper?,"I had high hopes for this book, and am enjoying certain passages. However, it really smacks of Term/Research Paper (sometimes endless quotes with no conclusory statement). I find it more enjoyable when Miller is simply formulating his own conclusions and opinions."
3,Decline,"The idea that conversation is in decline seems rather like the idea that every younger generation is a disappointment and declension from the high standards of the past. Anyway, it is worth conversing about/discussing and the book will please many readers. I was a little disappointed in that the book seemed to assume little knowledge in its readers. If you have read Boswell's Life of Johnson, taken an interest in Bloomsbury and so on [surely most British people who like books and have had an arts education], the book does not offer much new. I felt I was being told in a pleasant enough way things I already knew."
3,Six Days and Seven Nights,"I love this movie however it came to me in widescreen letterbox. I hate letterbox. It is an unfair way that Hollywood has to making the peons view their movies on a little portion of their screen. This product was not marked correctly. It it either widescreen or letterbox. This move is a 12 inch strip in the middle of my 46 inch TV. It is not viewable. Because it was paired with another movie, I am keeping it, but had it not been, I would have returned it. I do not appreciate mislabeling that is intended to misrepresent the product. This is not the seller's fault, but they should be sure they write the correct information down on the information portion of the movie."
5,Praise Causey!,"This transcends both synthpop and hardcore. Causey's voice is one of the most unique and spectacular singing voices I've ever heard, that I am sure of! The music varies from pseudo-evil synth to hardcore rock, mixed with Causey's trademark wail and the silky-hot bassist's moaning. *ooohh shudder!* I recommend the CD, but I further recommend attending one of Causey's services. Only in this way can the true light of Causey's love flow through you. Praise Causey!"
5,Can't take it out of the disc player,"I was a huge Satriani fan and still hold him in high regard, but Paul Gilbert has taken over the top spot in my personal guitar hero ratings. This album is so freaking good, the songs just rock and I too like that Paul. His sense of humor is right up my alley and the incredible blistering guitar runs are jaw-dropping. I am wearing this one out like I haven't done with a cd in years. If you don't like this release from THE Paul Gilbert don't bother buying any other one because you obviously aren't a fan of this genre of music. I felt compelled to write my first review because of how awesome this cd is, buy it, pop it in, and then lament the fact that this guitar wizard isn't on tour in the U.S. If you don't like it, I'll take it, it's so good I need another for my other cd player."
5,Paul burns his fretboard!,"Awesome CD. One of Paul's best. Every tune is a killer. Friday Night(Say Yeah) and My Religion are two of my favorites, along with My Drum and Amy is Amazing. Cool cover of I Feel Love, and Burning Organ is simply wild! A guitar players CD for sure, but also just damn good songs with Paul's metal edge, and I now use my pinky finger for fretting a lot more!"
2,Not for people with High Arches or All day long,"These shoes are great for shopping for a few hours or something but if you work on your feet...negative. Also they caused horrible foot pain due to barely any arch support.After 2 hours of standing my heels ached and my feet were really sweaty despite the little air holes.Also the strap is kinda flimsy and cheap.All in all not very impressed, not horrible for 35 bucks but definitely not up to ""Crocs"" standards...although they are far cuter.If you want a basic comfy cute shoe for everyday needs then its fine, working all day long on your feet I suggest something with more support."
4,Skechers Cali Women's Mary Jane,For the price these are great shoes. I do wear them with a liner because they are slightly uncomfortable without one. I plan to buy more in different colors. I like them much better than crocs. I am on my feet most of the day and when I come home my feet do not hurt.
2,CUTE SHOES THAT RUB THE WRONG WAY,"THIS SHOE WHILE CUTE, RUBS CONTINUELESSY ON MY PINKY TOE. LEAVING ME TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF QUITE OFTEN THROUGH OUT THE DAY."
2,Cute.. but not comfortable.,"I thought these shoes were so cute and I tried them on in a store, but they didn't have my size. At the time I thought they were comfortable so I ordered them online. One trip around the museum I work at and they had ripped the skin off the back of my ankle to the point that I had to push the backs down and walk around like they were clogs all day. I tried them a few other times and they always hurt the back of my ankles. Plastic is not a good idea for shoes."
3,I wanted to love them....,"Truly, I WANTED to love these Skechers Calies Chocolate Mary Janes, but I do not. Why? After two hours I could barely walk. After four hours I wanted to take off the things and chunk 'em. I bought them because I have about half a dozen other styles of Skechers. I LOVE my Skechers; however, this particular style chose to focus relentless pain in my size 5 1/2 to 6 feet all the way up through my calves. What caused this pain I am not sure, but I'm guessing the plastic, the shoe material, did it. All other Skechers are made of leather(like) substance and are comfortable (on me). However, the shoe style remains very similar. Sorry, Skechers, that I must say a bad word about you. Luckily, folks, what hurts me seems to be nirvana for you, as indicated in your reviews.Just had to have my say..."
2,Not comfortable.,I thought they would be like 'crocs' since they cost about as much and was disappointed.
4,Standard,"Scullard is still the baseline for all academic books written involving this time period. Most of them are compared to Scullard. I have the 4th edition of this book, but with the exception of a few expanded end notes it is the same as the 5th edition. First published in 1959 it is still the standard text for early Roman history classes. It is pretty easy to follow, but like any textbook for this period it does not cover much of anything in depth. It covers the big events from the Gracchi to Nero. The Gracchi are covered pretty well here and that is why I bought this book. Books on the Gracchi brothers are hard to find and when you do they are quite expensive. He of course covers the Julius Caesar and Augustus eras in fair detail. Not much on Nero even though he is in the title. The best thing about this book is the extensive list of further reading and Scullard's notes. A good introductory book and despite its age it is still easy to read prose."
5,A Hit!,"An excellent introduction to this turbulent period in Roman political history. Recommended for all students of Rome. Very thorough, but stays interesting throughout. Very factual, yet still allows one to form one's own ideas on the transformation of Rome from republic to principate. Scullard's extensive footnotes provide students with ideas on both the Ancient sources as well as modern contributions. An excellent Book!"
3,Barbarian he is not,"Confessions of a Barbarian is an inside look at the philosophy and ideas of one man. It also is a deep read into his ideas about women, love and lost relationships. The journals are well written and full of thought out prose, plays on words. It is excellent for any writer to read. Abbey uses many word plays and word games throughout the journals. He also philosophizes on life in general as well as his travels throughout his life. It was extremely interesting and well written."
5,This book is like a Bible for me,This book hooked me into Edward Abbey. It is uncensored and honest. It is also amazingly wise and funny. I read it all the time.
3,don't read this one first,The book is going to depend on what you wish to get from it. Getting to know cactus ed this close can dampen other works of his if you don't first read other titles.
4,My mistake,"Oops! I meant to order not just the music, but the screenplay, which my son's drama teacher wanted me to get for him. Well, we will make good use of it anyway! Arrived in perfect condition."
3,"Okay, but not complete","I bought this book to get the sheet music for ""My New Philosophy"". My two children are performing it for their musical theater class this term. Unfortunately, I didn't read the Book Description on the webpage, so I was kind of disappointed that our song wasn't included in this book. Still, I really like the songs ""Happiness"", ""Schroeder"", and ""The Kite"" so we've decided not to return it."
3,very saturated and dripping with progress,A healthy source of non fictionally based stories. Usefull for those who wish to learn what the book writes about. Understandable and easy to read. Good show.
5,pop67,This book keeps you going. It keeps you on the end of your seat wondering how is he going to pull this one out of the fire and there is always a solution. All his books are good but I think this one is up there with a TIME TO HUNT
4,"Way Overdone, But Nonetheless Entertaining.","This book is set in the wilderness of Southeast Mississippi and involves the legendary character, Earl Swagger, as he uncovers and takes down an evil force nestled amid the pines. The plot and the events in the book are preposterous -- characters are tortured or beaten beyond belief one day and then pop up in the best of health the next day. The protagonists, of course, are capable of tactical planning that would make a chess master weep. You know what I'm talking about. But I give this book four stars for the sheer creativity of Hunter. He grabs you early and doesn't turn loose of you till you finish the book. And just when you think you've got it all figured out, he fools you again. Hunter is an audacious author. Read this book just for the fun of it. Don't try to compare it to reality."
4,"Far from Hunter's best, but the only decent gun fiction","I am a tremendous Stephen Hunter fan, and consider him to be the best writer by far covering gun-related fiction in a credible way--as a Master class competitive shooter (with the venerable Gov't 45) I'm starved for such material. Having read every other book by him that I've been able to get my hands on, however, I feel compelled to say that ""Pale Horse Coming"" falls well below the high marks he has previously set. Based on the other reviews, it seems people are really enjoying this book, and I'm glad they are. If you liked ""Pale Horse Coming,"" however, I strongly encourage you to buy and read Hunter's other fiction--especially, and in no particular order, ""The Master Sniper"", ""The Day Before Midnight"", ""Dirty White Boys"", and ""Point of Impact""--all much superior to this most recent quite good but not very credible work. (Sorry, Stephen!)"
5,Pale Horse: Hunter has done it again.,Mr. Hunter has done it again. This book gets going quick and doesn't let up. It will leave you breathless. One of the best follow-ups I have ever read. The only regret I have is it will be another year until his next book.
1,The worst of Stephen Hunter,"I have read every book that Stephen has written, even the old stuff after I read Point of Impact. To be perfectly honest, this book didn't even hold my attention long enough for me to finish it. The book is full of gratuitious violence, racial sterotypes and seems to go nowhere."
4,"Good story, but a bit contrived","I like Stephen Hunter's work and have read most of his novels. ""Pale Horse Coming"" continues the saga of Earl Swagger as he takes on yet another evil conspiracy. I liked this novel until the last section which seemed to be contrived and out of character. I won't reveal much since it could give away the ending, but I think this plot line spoiled an otherwise great story. The book does grab the reader, typical of Hunter's writing and you have to keep reading to find out what happens next. Early Swagger is a bigger than life hero, but an honorable and noble character. This is a good story, well worth reading, but be warned that it does have considerable graphic violence."
1,Excruciatingly bad,"First off, I am a fan of Stephen Hunter and recommend other of his books including but not limited to Black Light, Time to Hunt and Point of Impact. But as one reviewer before me conservatively wrote: ""It is over the top."" Actually Pale Horse is way way over the top. Too long, too implausible, too many pages devoted to a long long long series of examples of man's inhumanity to man. There is too little action dispersed among pages and pages of boring dreck. The story is nonsense, the characters are ridiculous, the writing is tedious. Oh did I mention the total implausibility of the story? Usually that is not too big a handicap for Hunter, but in this case it proved disastrous. Pick up his other books. Skip this disaster. Maybe then you'll live with positive memories of the Stagger books. I'll erase this from my Kindle. It will be only the second book of hundreds purchased over the years to get that judgment."
3,Bullets aplenty in this violent story of vengeance,"This was so-so, though I imagine in its genre it is quite top-class. I'm not a fan of the gun-slinging storyline, and as such it might have been more impactful for someone else.Basically, the story is this: a lawyer researching the death of an individual finds a Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored) in the MIssissipi of '51. It is a horrendous place, and his marine friend has to rescue him from certain death there - and is himself captured.This marine, Earl Swagger (can't you picture that name?), suffers, escapes, and comes back armed as part of a seven-man group of gun-slinging revenge. It's gorey, it's mean, it's full of 50's racist slang, and it's a difficult read if you abhor violence.Still, there were characters very richly described, and I must admit, I was happy when some of the key evil folk got splattered.'Nathan"
3,Good... but not good enough,"When the bar is set as high as Mr Hunter's is, eventually there will be a disappointment. If this had been written by a newcomer, it would be a revelation. But following the unbelievable Bob Lee Swagger novels and the ripping Hot Springs, PHComing is a letdown, albeit an engrossing one. Don't get me wrong, you'll stay up late tearing through the pages, but the awe produced by the last 4 books (and even The Day Before Midnight) is absent.Maybe it's a one-time blip. My other favorite tough guy author, James Ellroy, seems to have lost the plot completely with the sprawling mess of The Cold Six Thousand, but I think Mr Hunter still has it in him. I'm sure Bob the Nailer has a few more scrapes to fight his way out of."
5,Hot Springs,"I had read this book about the Swaggers and several other Stephen Hunter books several years ago. I decided to read them again and this time keep the books. I recommend to you, if you have the time and interest, that you should read this series."
5,Gunning for justice.,Earl Swagger is back in action in a swampy southern hell hole mixing it up with folks that just need killing. And he goes about it with great friends and wonderful guns. Hunter seems to be the only writer that always gets the guns right and he sure puts them in the hands of some of the best this time.
3,Pale Horse Coming,"The book had an interesting summary. Never having read this author before, I decided to try it. I have plodded through & decided to finish but am not considering reading another of his works.."
4,Gripping story!,"I love the way Hunter integrates characters from previous novels, moving back in time to create new plotlines around them. This one involves Earl Swagger, father of Bob Lee, in a covert operation which plays on his character and training as a Marine and war hero. As usual, the ""good guys"" win, but not of course without collateral damage. Full of the usual suspense and action, Hunter's books are always a good read, and hard to put down."
3,A Good Book But Not Nearly Hunter's Best!,"If this is your first book by Stephen Hunter you'd probably give this book four stars, possibly more. However, having read Point Of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Time To Hunt, Hot Springs etc., Hunter's latest effort doesn't quite measure up. The first half of Pale Horse Coming was in typical Hunter fashion -- action upon action, details about guns, a Swaggert being larger than life. I couldn't put the book down! The second half, however, dragged in too many areas and the action slowed down considerably. Further, many of the events that occurred were somewhat predictable. Overall, Pale Horse Rising is a book I think you'll like -- you just won't love it -- an emotion that true Hunter fans have come to expect (demand?) from his books!"
3,See you and raise you...,"Stephen Hunter is one of a very few authors whom I can count upon to provide a great read in every book. Having said that, I would also have to say that of all his books, this one was the least enjoyable. As did Thomas Harris in ""Hannibal"" - his sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" - Hunter seems to have been compelled to ""up the ante"" in violence, characters, plot credulity.Still a good read, but getting close to Jumping the Shark."
2,Must be a guy thing,"I can appreciate the fact that I probably didn't like this book because it was written for guys - the ones who like war and guns and righteous vengeance. I think I could have enjoyed the story and overlooked the total mess made of the second half of the book if the dialog hadn't been so jarringly archaic and stilted. An example: ""You have killed me dead, sir."" ""I have, sir, for the evil you have done."" Okay, I did get some good laughs from that, so two stars for the funny dialog. As for the rest....I guess I'll never get it."
3,Pale Horse coming,"Standard Stephen Hunter Action; somewhat improbable action, but probably possible in the time that it relates to, the 50's. Good book. Hunter has researched his weapons, however he didn't talk enough with real gunfighters to see how real gunfighters go into a fight and how they survive."
5,Don't toss your air nailer if it stops working like it should,"I have a few P-C air nailers that I use as a handyman. My BN125 started giving me problems with driving or not cycling. Installed the overhaul kit, and now works like brand new."
1,Carelessly written book,"I bought this book because it contained a recipe for raisin bread. There were errors in the recipe;there were two references to adding flour but no flour left to add. The directions caused the bread to be severely overbaked and unedible. No, there is nothing wrong with my oven and I am an experienced bread baker. This error in the one recipe makes me suspicious about the entire book."
2,Just OK. Lot's of nice pictures,"Lot's of nice pictures. I've made 6 or 7 breads from the book. They all looked WONDERFUL but they were all lacking that great yeasty flavor one wants from a home made bread. The house smells great with the smell of bread but then the flavor seems to be non-existent. After research and using some other recipes, I came to find that the yeast measurements are way off. They need to be doubled in most cases. That made a huge difference in the quality of the bread."
3,"A decent book, in my opinion","I tried the Challah about 3 times, I highly enjoyed it (although I've never had traditional Challah, so I'm not sure if mine was what it's supposed to be), the pain de campagne was fantastic (took me back to when I lived in France) and I loved the Scottish Baps. I'd have to say I made about 6 or 7 of the loaves and found them to be good quality... the italian rosemary/raisin bread was delicious to me; however, I did notice it was a bit dry. I guess I was naive to believe there were no errors because I simply thought I had made a mistake. I do believe this book has some good basic recipes, I enjoyed the breads I made and the book served to make me more excited about bread. Good for beginners!"
1,Hopelessly incorrect recipes,"I am so ANGRY! I just wasted not only my money on this stupid book, but also the food I used trying to make one of the recipes! I have no idea how to salvage this mess. Way too many dry ingredients and not enough wet, so I have flour and butter covered apple and cheese semi play dough! Apparently there are tons of mistakes in this book. No wonder it was on $7 at the local bookstore. Do not buy unless you know how to fix the mistakes in the book. I am really disappointed."
1,Not a good bread book.,"We've been baking bread since back in the '80s and I can safely say that the recipes were some of the worse we ever encountered. Pictures look good, but don't expect your loaves to look that way. There are flawed recipes that are more of a recipe for a bread disaster than a success."
5,Recipes easy to compare with each other,"Most of these recipes are based on the same amount of flour (3.5 cups). So unlike most bread books, it is easy to compare two different breads, and understand how a different product results from variations in the other ingredients or the method.For example descriptions of soft, firm, sticky, doughs are hard to follow, but if the recipe lists more water than another for the same amount of flour, it is clear the aim is a softer dough. This is especially useful here at 7000 ft in the American SW where our flours and air are dry, and every recipe must be adjusted by increasing the water. With this book I have an idea where to go. The results are excellent, I used some of the recipes for display cooking for the final of a Commercial Baking Class. The crowd loved them."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"The lavish illustrations and slick production of this book initially mask its profound lack of substance.On reading the section on sourdough I could not but believe that the authors have never used sourdough. They certainly do not understand its microbiology, or have any feeing for its place in the history of breadmaking. Their so-called ""sourdough"" is nothing more than plain commercial yeast.Perhaps it is a pity that I first turned to the sourdough section, because having read it I lost all confidence in the book, and read no further. If the book has any virtues, I shall never know them."
2,"nice picture, but wrong recipe","I borrowed this book from library. At first, I am so in love with this book. There are a lot of nice pictures, and also in the begining of this book it show all the groups of Europian, Italian, etc. breads with beautiful pictures. It help me a lot to know the groups of them. I almost decide to buy one for my own, but when I tried the recipe for rolls. The bread was ok, but it need to bake in preheat 425F for 15-20 mins (that what the recipe call for). Luckily I check it first 8 mins because I don't think they need that high heat and for that long period of the time. It was almost burnt. If you want beautiful pictures, there are a lot in here, but not for recipes."
2,Need interior dimensions,Deceptive dimensions list the size of the lid. The interior of the box is at least five inches narrower in both directions so it is too small for the tools and items I had planned for it. Very disappointing. Seems well made other than this drawback.
2,Big Box,Box is not lockable and has no latch to secure the lid. Box cracked after first use. Lowe's sells a box of similar capacity with lockable lid at about half the price.
4,Tough enough,"The Duel at Silver Creek (Don Siegel, 1952, 77')Duel at Silver Creek was the first film where Audie Murphy played a character who was good all throughout the movie. Else, true Don Siegel, a lot of bad and lots of action.198us -The Duel at Silver Creek (Don Siegel, 1952, 77') -Tough enough - 25/10/2012"
4,Overlooked but very good....,"I had forgotten just how enjoyable this little Audie Murphy Western was until I recently purchased this handsome Universal DVD release. Murphy in this venture is ""the silver kid,"" and his co-star Stephen McNally actually steals the show. The action is fast-paced and believable, the plot way above average. There are shoot outs, claim jumping, and some humor thrown in--Audie has some droll lines. Universal-International made a number of fine Murphy Westerns in the 1950s into the mid 1960s. DUEL AT SILVER CREEK is one of the better ones. Now let's hope that Murphy's finest outing in the genre, NO NAME ON THE BULLET, and some of his other, better films---RIDE CLEAR OF DIABLO, GUNSMOKE, SEVEN WAYS FROM SUNDOWN, TUMBLEWEEDS, get the nod from the engineers at Universal."
5,THE DUEL AT SILVER CREEK,"ANOTHER AUDIE MURPHY GEM,SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT A YOUNG LEE MARVIN,IF IM NOT MISTAKEN THIS MAY BE HIS FIRST STARING ROLE...THIS MOVIE WAS MADE IN THE WESTERN HAYDAY,TODAY THE PLOT MAY BE CORNEY,BUT I THINK IT STILL RESONATES WITH BOTH WESTERN AND MURPHY FANS ALIKE,FOR IT SHOWS A TRUE WORLD HERO ON STAGE NOT AN IMITATION,I SAY TRUE WORLD HERO BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT FOR PEOPLE LIKE MR MURPHY AND MANY OTHERS,SEVERAL COUNTRIES WOULD BE SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE."
4,Excellent introduction,"Although over 20 years old, this book does a very good job of introducing the main topics in geostatistics. The writing is clear, if a bit plodding at times, and the approach they take of going through an actual analysis step by step, referencing theory as needed, is very instructive. That said, if you are looking for a ""cookbook"" for use with a certain software package, this is not it. I'm using this book to better understand the parameters and outputs in ESRI's ArcGIS extension, and it is a great complement to their more specific documentation."
1,An invalid variant of mathematical statistics,"Geostatistics violates the requirement of functional independence and ignores the concept of degrees of freedom. As a result, geostatistics cannot possibly provide unbiased statistical inferences such as confidence limits for metal contents and grades of reserves. Geostatisticians replaced the true variance of a distance-weighted average with the pseudo variance of a SET of degrees-of-freedom and variance-deprived functionally dependent distance-weighted averages. Those who want to embrace geostatistical thinking should first study the properties of variances as decribed in Volk's Applied Statistics for Engineers."
5,Anointed is totally wonderful! The Gospel R&B Style.,"Oh, I just love this music. It makes you want to dance and praise God and sing along with them. This is truly one of the greatest Christian Groups around."
3,L/XL is about a 7 1/4 meausrement.,"The hat came. It looked like the product description, was nice and light-weight....But, I put it on my head it it was too small. It fit, but it is tight enough that I know that I will never wear it. I have about a 7 1/2 sized head which is the edge of the large/x-large boundary but my head is too big for this product. Be warned. The problem is that I will be out of money both ways for shipping the product."
1,Not as Advertised,I got a hat covered in holes. There are no holes in the pictures. Would have loved it otherwise. Beware
1,Not what I expected,"This military style hat is made in China. I saw a similar US made one in my local Army / Navy store, but they didn't have my size. I thought this would be the same, but it's not. It has a strange line pattern in the material and just felt cheap. Although it's only ten bucks, I just expected something of a little better quality for my money. I sent it back."
3,good design and quality but wrong sizing,"My size is exactly 23 2/8"", so I got L/XL (the biggest they have). Sizing chart shows XL from 23 4/8 to 24 2/8. Well, both caps are bl00d-stopping tight, so they are going back. Too bad because material is excellent for summer, design is good, and quality is good. Order a sampler of sizes, and keep the one that fits you."
5,Especially for railroading buffs,"Florida's Great Ocean Railway: Building The Key West Extension by former college professor, professional boat captain, environmental guide, editor and writer Dan Gallagher is a meticulous study of the construction of a railway line that required extensive logistics, meticulous planning, as well as more than a decade of labor from 1905 to 1916, before it could be put into service. Black-and-white photographs fill the pages of this fascinating historical account which presents the impressive story of shaping dream into reality over the course of years and back-breaking effort. Florida's Great Ocean Railway is very highly recommended reading -- especially for railroading buffs."
1,not that great,"yes they are bags, but outside of that, they are not odor proof or see proof. Both those problems will not get me to buy them again."
3,Changing Times,"There were places that just ate up time. For instance, machinery working or the one I didn't like at all was the time spent on killing the goat. Yet it's okay. Catherine and Gerard were excellent."
3,Not for all the grease fans,"It's growing on me, but still I wish I had not bought it. The female lead singer is great, but the female chorus seems flat, especially on the high notes. Perhaps that's intended, as they are supposed to be quakey-voiced high-school kids. It seems hard to find a volume setting that is not too much in some places, but not enough for others. Overall: Gosh-darn annoying if you are into the music. If you are into theatre, then you might like this more than I do."
2,It Had to Grow On Me,"After being brought up on the motion picture soundtrack of Grease, it was kind of hard to get used to the Broadway stylings of the music. At first, I didn't like it one bit. I discarded the CD as soon as possible. But then an interest in theatre and Broadway grew in me, and I decided to give this CD a listen. Although I still do not find it as a great listen, I did begin to like it more than I used to.What really threw me off was the voice stylings here. They're a bit off. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned, the Sandy was a bit Rizzo, and Rizzo was a bit Sandy. I did find it kind of neat when I found out that Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror) was the Danny here. He faired well, but still, like the rest of the cast and company, he was a bit off.I look at this CD as the originic beginning of the Grease phenomena. But it goes low on my list of favorite Grease recordings."
1,BAD,The item has not arriverd yet....talked to support service online and gave me a new date although I'm skepticall. Didin't even recieve an apollogy message.
2,Grease is the. . . word?,"If you could see me right now, I would be rolling my eyes--but smiling all the same. This album is where the whole Grease phenomenon began. If you're all about the movie: DON'T GET THIS ALBUM, the songs are completely different and you probably won't like it. But, if you're interested in the true Broadway essentials of this classic play, than go for it--but be forewarned, the vocalists...well... they just aren't that great. They're slippery on the high notes and have a tone like a vacuum. The instrumentalists are decent but the arrangements are ""bare-bones,"" a few saxes and a rythym section. This soundtrack lacks a lot of what the musical is supposed to be about: teenagers having fun--the vocalists sound like chain-smoking thirty year-olds. However, listening to the CD is a lot of fun, especially if you see yourself as a future Sandy Dumbrowski or Danny Zuko. So watch it daddy-o's; think long and hard before purchasing this album."
1,A poorly researched waste of time,"At the very least an author should see that the final product has been adequately proofread. This throwaway ""pamphlet"" contains numerous factual and historical inaccuracies, mis-spellings and misnamed Fleming characters. It is as though the author never read even one of Fleming's, Benson's or Gardner's books. At best he may have skimmed them. One should not write this type of book on the basis of having seen a few James Bond Movies. True Bond fans will be disappointed and annoyed."
1,Garbage,"Do not confuse this with the ""James Bond Dossier,"" a great work for any Bond fan. This is really just junk and not worth the price."
1,Almost bought it... glad I didn't!,"I flipped through this book at a store and I was not at all impressed. The first page I flipped to had a typo, and I agree with the reviewer from Jersey about inaccuracies. I ended up putting the book right back on the shelf.Instead, I highly recommend ""THE BOND FILES: The Unofficial Guide to Ian Fleming's James Bond"" by Andy Lane, Paul Simpson. If you've ever wanted to know every language that Bond ever spoke, what gadget or gizmo he used in which movie, or all the aliases he's ever used, this is the book for you. ""The Bond Files"" is a great book with all kinds of facts, trivia, and information for each story, comic, and movie. The authors even review the opening title sequences and have a nice synopsis of each movie. They don't miss much with this book. On top of that, it's a nice 320 page paperback and a mere $7.95 cover price as opposed to the $20+ Dossier. Be sure to check it out!"
5,Life Changer,"This is now my number one product but at small dosage which means I cut the tablet to a 1/4 per day. I cannot take the full tablet at 250mg its just an overload for one day, I wish they would make a 50mg for ALCAR. It keeps my mind sharp and on time. I also take Magnesium and Multi."
3,Realizing Your Dreams Takes Work,Rikki Klieman's story is a bright reminder of the effort required to achieve your goals. Rikki's story is colorful and exciting. It is a good read.
5,This Los Angeles Times bestseller is a perfect summer read!,"I recently picked up a paperback copy of FAIRY TALES CAN COME TRUE: How a Driven Woman Changed Her Destiny, and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished the last page of the Epilogue! This driven woman's life reads like a novel, complete with suspense, intrigue, boldface names, steamy encounters, emotional meltdowns, and (which isn't giving anything away given the book's title) picking up the pieces all over again to create something even better. If you're a professional woman (or aspire to become one), in the legal profession in any capacity, or just enjoy getting inside the head and life of successful people, I think you'd enjoy this candid memoir. It's a perfect summer read!"
1,Oh please,"Despite some interesting cases, what makes this woman think we care about her life? She's not a role model for me or for any other woman I know..."
1,It's all about me,"Before I read the book I admired Rikki's intelligence and ability as an anchor on court TV. I still do, however, I can't imagine a more self-centered - it's all about me - superficial account from one's own lips!....."
1,"Or, How I Turned Pathological Self-Delusion into Big Bucks","This misguided manufactured celebrity is a perfect example of how someone of average intelligence, given enough greed and encouragement, can make a pile of money. That's about it.The writing style reveals worlds about her literary insularity.The monumental lack of self-awareness makes this book a good candidate for the Horror genre. If books by famous people interest you, I'd advise something by a professional wrestler. They know how to apply makeup, which is more than I can say for Ms. Klieman."
1,Legend in her own mind.,Ms. Klieman comes across as vapid and tiresome. Save your money and your time for something worthwhile--and interesting. This is neither.
2,Miss Remarkable?,"The best part of the book is Klieman's discussion of her cases and her law career. She is clearly a talented woman, but also a monstrously self-absorbed one. But perhaps that's the curse of the successful woman..."
4,Great record....,"Not as good as God Fodder or some of the tracks off their earlier ep's and singles, but it sure beats the extremely patchy Are You Normal? (Which still contains some great songs). Definitely well worth a listen if you like pop bands that aren't limited to the one idea but still write catchy tunes. This is by far Ned's most diverse record, and gains much from this. If you liked The Wonderstuff, or to a lesser extent, some of the later Suede material, this could be for you."
5,top one nice one get sorted,"This is a class album, from a great band, who I unfortunatley never saw live. Just about every track is ace, except the first tow singles, All I ask... and Floote.Make a purchase and you wont be dissapointed."
5,Excellent,Ruby Braff one of the most overlooked musicians with the sweetest sound ever heard. Never a bad recording.
2,Not really their best,"Unfortunately, this greatest hits collection borrows heavily from later albums, which weren't all that great. The best album remains their first one, ""Deep Sea Skiving,"" which unfortunately is not available. The pure, unadulterated fun and girlish exuberance of that album was never equalled since.Then came the album simply titled ""Bananarama."" It had ""Cruel Summer"" on it, but for me the slide had begun. Gone was the exuberant fun, replaced with a much slicker face (both in the music itself and in the girls' new glamorous appearance). It took away most of the fun for me.If you can find ""Deep Sea Skiving"" anywhere, get it. That's the best Bananarama."
3,All in one !,An excellent title to build your horoscope of 8 different astrologies It gives you a perfect forecast and a deep analysis of your personality
3,so-so,"slightly poor conidtion.broken zipper,missing zipper parts,etc.otherwise very very VERY nice hoodie.will wear it every day for rest of life,as soon as i get the zipper fixed."
4,Solid and very tight,"The contact at ""All Items Cheap"", when I thought I was in trouble, was very informed and helpful. The construction was so tight the key did not want to turn the cylinder. All that was needed was some WD-40. If someone drills it the lock will be destroyed. Yet, they will not be using that door."
3,The Study of Karate,Funakoshi writes about his life. And what it was like to learn karate in the times when it was hard to find a teacher. The book should be read by all karateka. There are two things I feel that are missing from this book. The focus on the Shuri district (there are three districts that are important to the development of Karate)and the fact that Funakoshi never likes to have dates recorded in any of his books.
5,This book is really the great book for everybody.,"I am also the karate player, but still not the good one. Before, I used to think that karate is only the matter of punching and kicking. Anyway after I have a good chance to read this book, I know more about the meaning of Karate-do. And I think it's really a good book not only for the karate player, but also for everybody. Although sensei Funakoshi was very old when he wrote this book, I think it doesn't matter. He wrote it with his sole from his 90-year experience."
5,Excellent book,A book that ever Karate practitioner should read. An interesting biography-like writing that amused me as a beginner. I highly recommend !
1,karate teacher,Anything he writes is crap dont buy anything by Gichen Funakoshi . just give it some thought why would he tell you anything. do your home work dont be stupid. if you do karate only train with folks that really knows the art. if it looks like a duck and eats corn its probably a duck.
2,Essential reading - but not a historical,"Funakoshi wrote this book near the end of his life, after America had bombed his karate dojo into the dust, after his son died, and after his wife died. His home in Okinawa was destroyed, and his people lived under the military rule of the United States. He expresses pacifism and the usual talent for exaggeration one finds in an old martial artist. Read his earlier works, like Ryukyu Karate Kenpo or Tote Jutsu to read the man before the war when he was cocky, obnoxious, and prepared to teach us all karate to make us good Japanese subjects."
1,useless book,If you want to learn real karate don't buy this book. Not worth it. I wasted my time reading through it and at the end didn't learn anything.
4,Karate Do My Way of Life - For The True Martial Artist,"For anyone who believes that they have made a lifelong committment to the Martial Arts, you should read this book. Master Funakoshi intertwines the important spiritual and physical components of a life in ""the way"" with the story of his own personal life. One of the things that I liked most was that he went through some of the same thought processes that I have during my training. If you are truly a student of the Martial Arts (whether it is Karate or not) this book belongs in your personal library."
5,A must read for martial artist! excellent!,This book Funakoshi wrote about his life and the meaning of karate is invaluable ...I absolutely loved this book...If you are interested in Martial arts history or study Martial arts yourself this book will help you better understand the true meaning of self defense and Karate
5,Applies to Everyday Life!,The 5 star reviews are accurate! This book is applicable to the martial arts enthuistists and everyday life. Smooth and unencumbered writing style delivers his observations about life and the martial arts in a clear concise manner.
4,funny funny,like this kind of cartoons/hentai his adventures are great and very clever would recommend this to any one
2,boobies only bad,"....very bad , no story , ok animation, no character development . Did I say bad story?"
3,A fun guilty pleasure,"The Mouse is about a man who is a nerdy teacher by day, and internationally infamous thief by night. He is supported by three curvaceous attendants (who also pose as his dominant school co-workers) who constantly fall all over themselves trying to please The Mouse. And while they're not falling over themselves, they also assist The Mouse by retrieving intel for him to better prepare him for his next prize.Admittedly, the plot is pretty thin and the episodes are fairly short but I do love the visual style that also comes with a lot of fanservice. The Mouse himself seems to be a little too wishy-washy for being 'an internationally infamous thief' but his crew are bright, cheery, and colorful. This isn't a very deep story but I wasn't exactly looking for one here either. The Mouse is about fun and it has plenty of it."
2,DISAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was not what I expected, I was disapointed in it!!! but due to the price it was not worth sending back!!! I paid more for the shipping cost than the movie it self!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Decent Radio,"This radio doesn't do anything exceptionally well, but it has the functionality that I wanted... digital tuning and decent AM reception. The TV and FM reception are below average indoors, but that is probably to be expected with any portable radio. I'm happy with my purchase, but if you're expecting an outstanding product you will probably be disappointed."
1,Radio review,"I bought this radio and used it for AM and FM. It worked okay for a while, now the on-off switch doesn't work and I can't turn it on. The last time I tried to turn it off, I had to remove the batteries to stop it. It is now a paperweight. Don't buy one, mine worked only about 3 months."
2,Limited,"I got this free with coupon. You get what you pay for. It is worth it if you get it for free. Mine does receive NOAA weather, but overall quality of this radio is pretty low. On the positive side, it does work, it has NOAA (with weather alert feature) and TV channels, AM/FM digital tuner, clock radio with alarm and snooze feature. Very light weight. Uses AC/DC (adapter not included) and 3 D cell batteries (not included). Has earphone jack and external antennae jack. Put it in your emergency kit for when you lose power."
1,Coby CX-788 Disappointing,"This radio failed after a few days of use. The reception was very poor from the start, but at least there was sound. Then the sound failed. Then it wouldn't turn off unless the batteries were removed. It is a piece of junk."
1,Total Piece of Junk,"Don't be deceived by the sleek modern looks and digital tuning of this radio. Although the AM/FM portion worked fine and dandy, it was the NOAA weather radio band that I was truly interested in (who buys a radio at this price just for AM/FM?). To no avail could I catch ANY reception (pure static) with the NOAA radio station, even though I live less than 15 miles from their 1000 watt transmitter! At first I thought the NOAA station was down, but a friend came over with a cheap analog tuner and caught the station very clear due to our high reception area. Therefore, this unit is absolutely useless to me. It's a good thing I bought and tested the unit before extreme weather hit me, or else I could be dead today! So not only is it a rip-off piece of garbage, but it's a public safety hazard. If you value your life, don't buy this."
5,How to Communicate Data Wireless,"If anything, I think that the authors of this book don't realize just how big Mobile IP is going to be. They talk mostly about the use of IP devices in truly mobile, as in moving around. This includes not only the commonly known devices such as Palms or BlackBerries, but also specialized devices installed in delivery trucks, police, ambulances, fire trucks. Furthermore, there is a very defined need for devices using Mobile IP Technology in semi-permanent locations. This includes applications such as ATM machines and gas pumps. These devices are much easier to install and maintain if they communicate wirelessly.Still, regardless of the application, the technologies discussed in this book apply. Here the basic communications protocols and techniques that are used. It is an excellent summary of the way that IP traffic is handled in a wireless environment."
5,Great Artist and Songs,"one of the most influential and most important Musical Icons Ever who help shape and style the form of Modern Music. as a Songwriter,Producer, Arranger,Multi Instrumentalist,Conceptionalist, Band-Leader,etc... you name it and Prince did it. Musically he has no limits then or now. this collection of Hits captures songs that over the years so many folks know by heart. the Man is a Musical Genius and he has left a standard. He Brought the Funk, Pop,Rock, Gospel,Slow Jams and everything else in between. He is One Badd Soul Brother!!!!!!! Broher Man did His thing."
5,THIS CD IS GREAT,"I LOVE IT FROM BEGINNING TO END, IT HAS SOME FAST PACED WORK OUT MUSIC WITH JUST THE RIGHT SOUND. AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNISE HARDLY ANY NAMES SO I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA SUCK BUT I WAS DEFINATELY WRONG. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU BLAST ON THE RADIO."
2,Standard Tourist Sight-Seeing Guide,"While the guide may review restaurants, hotels or museums that are not typically covered in other guides, its failure to address local activities was disappointing. Information on bike rental shops, scuba shops, fun tours or other things are absent. If you want a guide to more than hotels, restaurants and museums you might want to reconsider this purchase."
2,Freaky exploration of prophecy and destiny.,"""The Sartius Exori - who will be the one ?""Hyperspace jumps alter the mind, and when that kind of scene gets underway there's often a touch of spiritual mania floating round the place. Here an unlikely hard man becomes a messianic leader to save the troubled world from its pain and confusion. He's not nearly as ""nice"" as Jesus, but for some weird reason has still been chosen ! It's not as subtle as a Philip K. Dick, who treated similar themes more originally, but it gave me a unique new image of redemption."
3,I liked the book more than the previous reviewer,"Everyone likes different things in books. I liked this one more than the previous reviewer did. It's not my favorite book of Leigh's, though. As he often does in his books, he explores issues of gender, this time by creating an alien society dominated by females."
1,Not Recommended,"I purchased two of these units from a local hardware store onJanuary 1st. I used them on and off, with both units plugged in, until yesterday when one unit died on me and won't turn on. The next morning the other unit died on me as well and wouldn't turn on. Both units together lasted less than six days of use."
3,Works well but vibrates really loudly,"I bought this for its features (the fan setting, low wattage, etc) and am happy with it from that perspective. But it's incredibly noisy!"
4,"very small desk top heater, not for full room heating",i thought it be larger it's very small i hope it can heat my bed area in winter. thank you michael m.
2,"Unreliable, failed after 3 months",This unit used to put out enough heat to keep our small sailboat warm; we live aboard full time.However! After three months the unit began cutting out and requiring longer and longer to restart. Now it just randomly turns on and off regardless of the heat setting or fan setting. This unit is worth even less than what we paid for it.
1,Dismal heater fan- not recomended,"I had an old Pelonis heater fan that went out after four years of constant use. I bought a Holmes that just blasted the air out causing too much moisture in my bathroom- I thought I would try the Pelonis that I knew put out less air. The fan is less than acceptable...The fan does not have an adjustable fan setting (contrary to what others say), there is only a thermostat (with no temp, just bars of heat) and a low/high setting for power consumption. The fan comes on fine but some type of auto temp thing inside turns it off after only about 10-13 minutes. I always put it on HIGH, with the temp at its highest and it just shuts off, and then back on, and back off and so forth. Extremely useless.I would return it if I had the box..."
1,Doesn't last long,"Bought this in late October, and I use it in my office two days a week for about 6 hours....today....it just stopped working. Time to return it and get something else....."
2,Pelonis Heater,"This heater has cheap quality. It doesn’t function well as it supposed to be. It doesn't worth the money I paid for. If I have the choice, I would like to return for full credit. But, in consideration into the shipping cost for a return, I'm very reluctant to keep it."
5,Great value for a useful little heater,"I have used this heater in my bedroom for about a year. After a year of consistent use, it works perfectly and shows no signs of wear. This heater operates quietly and does not produce any smell. The fan has multiple variable modes (fan, low, medium, and high) and variable heat levels. The fan is small but can heat up a room of about 15 x 20 fairly quick (about 10 minutes). Also, a great feature of this heater is that neither the housing nor the area behind the fan ever gets hot at all when the fan is in use. This means that I have never worried about burning my self when moving the fan or warping anything that I keep behind the heater."
2,fan broke after some use,"Gave this to my friend for Christmas and after using for a week or 2, it did not work. Unreliable!"
2,Flimsy,"You get what you pay for. I needed a small space heater to warm a room while I waited on a replacement for a wall-mounted heat pump/air conditioner unit. Thought this would do in a pinch - NOT. Plugged it in, turned it on, fan blade was striking the inside of the housing until it got up to speed. When I turned it off, when it slowed to a certain speed, fan banging on the housing again. Called tech support number - fellow that answered was no help. Said they only dealt with replacement parts, no troubleshooting solutions so all I could do was return it. Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't last long,"I used the heater infrequently for a couple of months, then one day it died. It was probably just a defective unit, but that's enough for me to switch to another brand."
3,amp review,"A very affordable, problem free amp. I would buy it again. I merely listen to the radio, I do not blast the volume so for my use it works just fine."
1,worthless,"This Amp looks like a 2 channel 240 watt amp but that is as far as it goes. Sound is better with radio car came with.This distortion at any level and you csn't hear.Try to hook up 4 speakers and it will not work at sll.You have to hook up other speakers to radio ha with same wire or you will have problemss Being disabled but used to hook up custom sytems,I spent yestwerday wiring for truck tha pulls boat and spent 8 hours for nothing as this only works 1 way. decide which 2 to amp and hook rest to aftermarket harness evenwith rca cables and same wire or will not work. low impedance does not work at all. Thanks for Craigs list , at least I can get money back plus 10.00 like all pyramid products, JUNK< JUNK< JUNK< JUNK!"
3,Overly optimistic power rating,"This unit uses a Toshiba TA7250BP output amplifier rated at 23 watts into 4 ohms, one for each channel. Even if you include both channels it only a 46 watt amplifier. 240 watts is a blatant lie. I had problems with input noise. Not very forgiving of ground loop conditions."
1,horrible alternator whine,avoid this amp.....the noise is unbearable. i bought it because of the size/ mounting location. replaced it with an old Alpine amp and everything is quiet again.
2,Nikon Monarch,Scope was received in a Nikon scope box. The scope was possibly a demo model or was handled by someone. You are supposed to receive Nikon flip covers for this model of scope. They were removed from the box and I never received them.
5,Flawless without the chill.,"It is a loss to all classical music lovers that the talents of Miss Shkolnikova are now heard by so very few. Following a long concert and even longer teaching career she happily retired to Australia, this recording captures her at her mature zenith - flawless, robust and evocative. I do not believe there is another recording of this supreme antecedent to the likes of Anne-Sophie Mutter and her contemporaries."
3,Fun-filled but somewhat inaccurate,"Presidential Fact Book is a fun-filled books about the 42 presidents. It has all of the facts and trivia one ever wants to know about the presidents. There is one not so minor detail that needs to be mentioned, however. Some of the facts need to be up-dated, especially the dates that some recent presidents and first ladies died."
4,really helpful,this is a very helpful book. lives up to its promise of taking apart the honda civic completely. gives you the confidence and assurance of dealing with the problems of your high mileage honda civic. the book is very well organied too and supported by a very helpful collection of photographs.
5,GREAT REFERENCE BOOK,GREAT FOR THE DO IT YOURSELF CANNOT AFFORD OVER PRICED MECHANIC TYPE. THE HOME MECHANIC SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A REF MANUAL FOR HIS VEHICLE
5,Lite Brite Flat Screen Pink,Gotten for grand daughter for a Christmas Present. She loves it and spends hours making pictures. Lite Bright has been around forever and continues to be a beloved toy for any child for hours of entertainment.
5,A throwback for grandkid,We loved this when our kids were little.Now their children are really enjoying making their owntemplates and pictures!
4,Lite Brite,It is so nice to not have to plug in like we all had to do in the 1980s. It uses batteries instead... so the light doesn't shine as bright. I may try to travel with it in the car... but a little nervous about losing some of the little lights. It's a great way for preschoolers to learn some of the letters of the alphabet to go along with the colors.
5,amazing band!!,this album is amazing and this band will definitely change your life. but for 100 dollars... even andrew wouldn't let you do that. he'd tell you to download it!!
3,A correction.,"This movie takes place in Caledonia Minnesota, not Wisconsin like is written on the box. That was an error on the studio's part. As a citizen of Caledonia Minnesota and a fan of this film, I just thought I should clear that up."
1,Horrible,I am a big Mickey Rourke fan but I must say this is probably one of the few movies that he has been in that really sucked (Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man and the action garbage he did 'Point Blank'... or at least that is what I think his Die Hard in a mall was called). This movie was just really horrible and I watched it once and doubt I will ever see it again. The buck toothed goofey grinning Baldwin brother stands out as being particulalry bad.
2,Interesting Failure,"Stephen Baldwin and Mickey Rourke as a pair of gay thieves? I don't think so. As usual in theses films (2 straight actors pretending to be gay), the 2 leads barely even touch each other. Rourke's dialogue is laughable. The 'non-name' actors are more interesting than 'names'. The film's opening is very promising, but goes downhill from there. Yet another example of 'getting it wrong' when straight (?) directors attempt to protray gay characters."
2,Intriguing,"I am an avid fan of Ann Rule's books but in this book, I think she was one sided. I do believe that Dr Green killed her children and tried to poison he husband, but I believe there was more things that went on in that marriage than she wrote about. What led to her drinking and drug abuse? Why would someone so intelligent let herself go like that? She seemed to me to have a very low self esteem and the inablility to cope. I just think there is more to this that either Dr Green herself is willing to divuldge or her family members."
4,Really interesting but one-sided,"I am not a huge Ann Rule fan, mostly because I find hergenerally to be simplistic, not very analytical and very often one-sided. It is like she takes a point of view and spends the book's entirety defending it, instead of presenting an unbiased account and letting the reader decide. She comes to conclusions for us. This book is a good example. But one thing I do have to say -- she h as great taste in stories! This is a facinating story in itself, and I think it would be difficult for any skilled writer NOT to make a success out of this one. I found it hard to put down because I really did want to find out what happened, even though I was often frustrated by Ms Rule's contention that Debora Green is the devil incarnate and Mike Farrar was a saint. (Even when she discussed his faults, they were always followed up with a ""but...""!)"
3,"Good, but not the best by Ann Rule","Ann Rule is my favorite. The subject of this book wasinteresting as all of her choices always are. Somehow with this book I was left wanting more. I felt as if there were details of importance to better understand the story that were left out. Maybe it's just me. I have to admit that I was left a bit confused on the poisoning issue. But not blaming that on Ann Rule, the answers were just not there. Nevertheless, having bought the book only yesterday and finishing it about an hour ago, like all of her fine books, it was a ""no put downer""!"
2,not up to the 'Ann Rule' standard of excellence,"Ann Rule has set an exacting standard of excellence in truecrime writing...one that few authors can emulate. However, her recent book,""Bitter Harvest"" was a disappointment. The story choice was intriguing (as are all her choices) but it seemed like she spent most of the story rehashing and repeating the same information that was explained in the first hundred pages. Her stories are usually overflowing with descriptions and evaluations and character analysis but not this time. We still love you Ann but please...bring back the old ""Ann Rule Standards for Excellence"" for your next book."
3,"Great Potential, But...","While this book had great potential, I think, when compared to other true crime thrillers, it fell far short of the mark. Rule spends far too much time with little details and fails to give us the nuts and bolts of what makes a true crime thriller really interesting--the personality behind the criminal. Rule lacks both the hypnotically lyrical prose of And The Sea Will Tell and the mesmerizing look at the man (Jeffrey MacDonald) behind the mask in Fatal Vision. This book is ultimately sad, as all true crime thrillers are, but it is really not worth the time and effort. I feel terribly sorry for the children involved, who were the true victims. The husband will have to live with the consequences and accept his share of the blame. Bitter Harvest is definitely not Rule's best effort. Look elsewhere this time."
3,Husband Exonerated!,"Ms Rule had me totally annoyed with her acceptance and portrayal of Dr. Farrar as such an innocent. Throughout the book, I kept wondering why he didn't ACT!!!! Wanting to save a marriage was one thing, but his total denial of the emotional turmoil affecting his children was something else. As others have said, I have read every Ann Rule book and am usually very happy with her presentation. This time, I truly felt that she let her readers down. Deborah Green remains unexplained, as do the reasons for the tragedy . . . I have more questions than answers."
4,A chilling story: Bitter Harvest,I have been a fan of Ann Rule for many years. Part of the interest I have in her books is the detailed account of the investigation. Some may find that less interesting than the events that inspired the story. I think that is what makes her books very distinctive. I found Bitter Harvest to be another fantastic book by Ann Rule. I couldn't stand to put it down. I found myself racing home from work in the evening just to find out what would happen next. I can't wait for her next book!
2,Inadequate,This books falls short of giving the reader an adequateunderstanding of the personal downfall and the 'motive.' Does a poor job of delving into the psyche of the people involved.
4,Bitter Harvest a good read with incomplete ending,"I read everything Ann Rule writes because she takes the time and trouble to try to figure out the ""why"" of these horrific things. I was left with the same confusion as another reader, which is a brief overview of the kind of woman who can tell the son who adored her to go back into the house and ""wait for help"". I think there's a lot more to her than simply a woman with too high an IQ, a sleep-around husband, and a lot of anger. I wish Ann could write a sequel and cover that issue. All in all, a worthwhile book, leaving the reader with a lot of questions."
1,Don't bother spending the time or money!,"I'm usually a big fan of Ann Rule. But I have to ask... why did she bother writing this book? There wasn't anything that you couldn't have learned by reading the newspaper details. In fact, after I read this book I asked myself, ""why did I bother reading it?"" I'd save your time and money. There are a lot better books out there!"
3,"Good book, but not her best","I've read almost every book Ann Rule has written, and this book is good, but it didn't have the same character analysis that some of her other books had. I wasn't spellbound by the book, but it was interesting enough to make me want to finish it."
2,Half the story is missing from this book.,"I do consider Ann Rule to be the master of true crime writing, even if she did graduate from the School of Redundancy School. HOWEVER, there was something missing in this book. Objectivity, maybe? An editor, perhaps? To repeatedly berate and emphasize that Deb Green used bad swear words when angry, yet a mere MENTION of the fact that violent hubby Farrar knocked that kid's head through a wall! Wait a minute, back up--that husband had some kind of major psych problems, too. How come Ann didn't look a little closer at that? It's like half the story is missing from this book. I think Ann's next book should be called ""Strange Attraction: An Author's Crush on a Goofy-Looking Doctor."" Soon to be a Lifetime Movie."
2,Story does not ignite my imagination-OOPS,"I think that Ann Rule might be carrying a flame for Mike too. She clearly presents him as the angel in the first few chapters, and continues to paint a dismal picture of Deb throughout the first half of the book. It is obvious she is guilty, so the story really never heats up. So we lose the fun of trying to figure out the ending, right? The story was horrifying, so it kept me entertained, but I never really felt that I got any kind of closure as to why she did what she did. I guess the answers to lifes problems get a little diluted seen through a liter of gin. Ann needed to fan the flames a little more in her interview with Deb at the end of the book to get more interesting answers out of her. All in all, an O.K. read, but fails to really light my fire."
4,Non Stop Reading,"I have every book written by Ann but unfortunately she can write them faster than I can read. I work a lot and have to fit reading in 10 minutes here or a whole hour there, so it usually takes me a couple of months to get a book read. I took Bitter Harvest on a cruise and could not put it down! The story is so sad, to think that a Mother could kill her own children to hold on to their Father in a failing marriage. Honey, when he doesn't love you, he doesn't love you, you can't make him through the children. This woman had so much intelligence and yet no common sense. Like I said the whole time I was on the cruise I didn't want to do anything but read--how can that be?? I loved my cruise but the book was one of Ann's best. All the time and research that is put into each and every book is evident!!"
4,an enigma,"I first read this book a year ago, when it came out in hardcover, from the library. 2 days ago I saw it in paperback, and bought it. When I read it in hardcover, I hated it..... it left me frustrated and hurt and angry that a mother could watch while her children burned to death. Now reading the paperback..its like reading a totally different piece of literature. I cant put it down, and have been up for a day and a half reading it when im not at work. Women Like Dr. Green are an enigma...what makes them behave the way they do, and what makes them go from preforming normally in society to comitting murder. ""hell might have no fury than a woman scorned"", but hell never met Dr. Green! I only wish she could get the death penalty... and die the way her children did. Rule definately rules in writing true crime, .... and I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read for a long weekend....but now I cant wait til Nov 99 for the next rule book to arrive."
3,Not bad,This was the first book I've read by Ann Rule. I am not totally disappointed nor am I as upset like some of the other readers who gave this a terrible review. I looked for all the books they have written and couldn't find one of them. Hmmm...maybe they shouldn't be so critical? The story was a very good one and hard to fathom. It did seem pretty biased though. The author seemed to present this from the father's point of view which didn't seem entirely fair since he apparently had some issues of his own. I found this to be a good book overall. I can live with redundancy once in awhile unlike a lot of other wanna be authors.
3,"Good book, but not her best","I've read almost every book Ann Rule has written, and this bookis good, but it didn't have the same character analysis that some of her other books had. I wasn't spellbound by the book, but it was interesting enough to make me want to finish it."
2,Not one of your best Ann...,I have to agree with others on this one.A wee bit repetitiveand downright boring in some parts.Ann Rule is one of my favourite authors but I was disappointed in this book.This is one of the rare times that I have not finished a book.Better luck next time.
2,Inadequate,This books falls short of giving the reader an adequate understanding of the personal downfall and the `motive'. Does a poor job of delving into the psyche of the people involved.
1,Save your money.,It was not worth the time or money. I wish I had both back. I have been an avid fan of Ann Rule. Unfortunately this book missed the mark.
3,Definitely A One Sided Story,"Where was Mike Farrar's responsibilty in this??!! He is portrayed as such a victim through the whole story. The only thing I think he was victimized of was the ricin poisoning. He should have been busy getting custody of those kids instead of tending to his sex life. Debora was/is obviously a lunatic.That was clear from the beginning of their marriage. Why they proceeded to have three children in an already bad situation, is typical of Modern American Family Destruction. It seemed as if he married Debora for her prestige and income, not for the ""good person she was"". Thank God Lissa has survived and a father who is now involved. Although he's ALREADY remarried...what a surprise....hopefully he has made better choices. But they always seem to be self serving."
3,"Entertaining first half, boring second half","Most of the second half of this is a very boring recitation of the pretrial hearings and trial of the mother accused of torching her house and killing two of her kids. It's very dull. The first half, however, is a pretty interesting look at the buildup to the crime, involving two wealthy doctors and their dysfunctional marriage. Deborah Green was obviously mentally ill, but she didn't get the correct treatment. The end was tragic. This isn't one of Ann Rule's better efforts, but it's still worth reading."
2,"Story interesting, delivery repetitive.","The characters were very interesting. Ann told the sameinformation when she set the story up, when she covered the series of events and again through the investigation and during the court trial. This made the book very boring."
3,"Interesting, but biased account","I thought Ann Rule did a good job of organizing and presenting this convoluted tale. The book was somewhat repetitive, however.My one major problem with the book is that it didn't explore the husband's culpability in his children's deaths. It is inconceivable to me that any responsible father would leave his children in the care of an unstable woman (he tried to commit her only three weeks previously) who he knew tried to poison him previously. His explanation was he thought she was 'better' and she had never hurt the children before. Obviously he was wrong. It is unbelivable that not one single person connected to the case pointed out this bizarre logic. I think any details on this line of questioning were probably left out of the book to keep it going towards one angle. I am afraid for his surviving daughter."
5,Another great book by Ann Rule!,"Sad story of once brilliant Dr. who turned pathetic lost sole, clinging to husband, brainwashing children, and does the unthinkable of destroying lives. Her husband tried to get help but it was late in the game and he fueled the fire by cheating on her and coming out innocent. What happened to a bright person who had EVERYTHING?? Why did this happen, Dr. Green and husband got together for the wrong reasons, it is obvious. Amazing story."
4,Really interesting but one-sided,"I am not a huge Ann Rule fan, mostly because I find her generally to be simplistic, not very analytical and very often one-sided. It is like she takes a point of view and spends the book's entirety defending it, instead of presenting an unbiased account and letting the reader decide. She comes to conclusions for us. This book is a good example. But one thing I do have to say -- she has great taste in stories! This is a facinating story in itself, and I think it would be difficult for any skilled writer NOT to make a success out of this one. I found it hard to put down because I really did want to find out what happened, even though I was often frustrated by Ms Rule's contention that Debora Green is the devil incarnate and Mike Farrar was a saint. (Even when she discussed his faults, they were always followed up with a ""but...""!)"
1,A biased dud.,"I have read most of Ann Rule's books. They are usually interesting, although always contain errors and contridictions, and are ALWAYS biased. That said, I expected all those things in this book, but was floored by just how much bias there was. It was almost as if Ms. Rule had some kind of attraction to the goofy-looking Mike Farrar. She did convince me of one thing, though...Debra Green DID NOT commit the crimes...I think a real good case could be made against Mike and Celeste.. and why the police did not follow through on this is beyond me...and of course, Ms. Rule never did say. This book was the absolute worse one she's ever done."
2,Not her best.,"I have read most of Ann Rule's true crime books and have always enjoyed her descriptions, the attention to detail and the weaving of them into a first-rate read. Unfortunately, Bitter Harvest did not do it for me. The story could have been told more effectively in one-third the pages, and at that length would have reduced or eliminated the repetition that occurred from chapter to chapter. It seemed the final 100 pages had nothing new to offer and I skipped to the final 3 or 4 pages."
3,"Good, but not the best by Ann Rule","Ann Rule is my favorite. The subject of this book was interesting as all of her choices always are. Somehow with this book I was left wanting more. I felt as if there were details of importance to better understand the story that were left out. Maybe it's just me. I have to admit that I was left a bit confused on the poisoning issue. But not blaming that on Ann Rule, the answers were just not there. Nevertheless, having bought the book only yesterday and finishing it about an hour ago, like all of her fine books, it was a ""no put downer""!"
1,Poor writing always indicates poor research.,"It is obvious from the huge amount of filler material that Ann didn't do her homework for this book. The same material she used to build the characters in the beginning chapters reappears while discussing the court case. This book drug on and on, nearly putting me to sleep several times. I decided to skip some information, hoping it would get better. It got worse. The treatment of Debbie versus Mike was a red flag that Ann had not studied her subjects very well. Either she failed to recognize Mike's role in this crime against his ex-wife and children, or she glossed over his personality flaws for some reason. (Ann has always favored good looking men.) For whatever reason, it wasn't all Debbie's fault, as it takes two to tango. I don't not recommend this book. Several books I recommend are Son, by Jack Olsen, An Hour To Kill by Dale Hudson and Billy Hills, and Careless Whispers by Carlton Stowers."
3,Boring Harvest,"The book was a bit boring and while I have no pity for Debora Green, it was her husband Mike that I wanted to slap. I don't understand how this man left his children with her for one minute. Clearly she was out of her mind from the very begining of their marriage and instead of portraying him as a weak little nerd, Rule would have you believe that Mike was the amazing Superman."
3,Not one of Rule's best books,"The story truly was gripping, as was the careful description of the forensic evidence at the scene of the fatal fire. However, unlike Rule's STRANGER BESIDE ME and SMALL SACRIFICES, there's never a feeling of real comprehension or understanding of this woman's psyche. I came away from the book feeling overwhelmed by the tragedy, but not any closer to understanding it."
5,Classic True Crime Tale,"This is not only Ann Rule's best book but one of the best true crime books ever written. Rule writes in her usual crisp, clear, engaging style. Her exhaustive research into this tale of murder is very evident as well as her amazingly fair and insightful portrayal of all of the major participants. She keeps adding details and facts keeping you on the edge, never knowing what waits for the reader on the next page. And she brings up the apparently controversial thought: is this woman who allegedly killed her children mentally ill and deserving of our pity or truly an evil person? The reader has to decide. Riveting!"
3,"No, he wasn't a saint, BUT","It's been a few years since I read this but remembered it because Discovery Health Channel recently did a show about his poisoning. The fire was mentioned almost as an afterthought at the end of the program; he said he left the kids alone with her because nothing she had ever done indicated to him that she would ever harm them.I have relatives who lived in the Kansas City area at the time and they said some things in the book were not quite correct, and Rule's seeming portrayal of Dr. Farrar as a long-suffering, saintly husband went a wee bit over the top. Okay, a LOT over the top, and that's why I gave it three stars, not four.As for the woman who claims to be a friend of Dr. Green's, if your stories are true, why didn't you post them here?"
1,a bitter disappointment,"this is the second ann rule book i've tried. couldn't finish either. the other one was called 'too late to say goodbye'.it's a common theme for professionals to produce just to meet a quota, without adding their talent to their work. you can't write twenty five books without taking away from each one. that's why so many readers are giving ann one star. the quality isn't there.i couldn't recommend ann's best work because i've only tried these two. i would like to find something of hers worth my time. any recommendations ?"
5,Excellent,"I have never read anything by Ann Rule before. I half expected it would be like reading a police report, but I was pleasantly surprised at the way she kept the narrative flowing. I was equally impressed by her excellent ability to delve into the human psyche."
2,Buyer Beware,"I have been a fan of Nicholas gunn and Johannes Linstead for years, and I bought this hoping for new original songs but realized it is just a rehashing of songs from albums i already owned. If you have the artists other albums- don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not Much to Write Home About,"My previous experiences with CMT products have been quite positive. I jumped on a great sale price for this 8-1/4"" ripping blade in hopes that I might have a diamond in the rough on my hands. It took about two seconds to notice that this blade has teeny tiny little teeth reminiscent of those found on the Chinese made $0.99 blades found at those travelling circus tool shows that stop in town once or twice a year. This was very disappointing for what I anticipated to be a premium quality blade made in the European Union. To keep things fair and in perspective, it does cut respectably for a $10 blade, but nothing overly impressive about it. This is essentially a disposable blade...those teeth will not withstand a resharpening. Even though it was inexpensive, I expected more and was severly disappointed in this item."
1,A very inaccurate Xena reference...,Not a good Xena reference book! This book in very innaccurate. The Xena episode guide is frequently wrong. I don't follow Hercules as much so I can't really comment on the Hercules episode guide. I would not waste my money on this book.
5,Portrait of a continent,"This book was published several years ago but its portraits of Europeans remains vivid and provoking. Even though it's out of print (shame on the publisher!), this remains one of the best examples of literary journalism, and a valuable travel reader for anyone visiting Europe. It's well-worth the effort of buying it second-hand and we can only hope that it will be reprinted in the future."
3,"Not Honeywell, No foam gasket","Like the other reviewers, I agree this is not a Honeywell name brand. Note that this does not have foam gaskets around the outside, so decide if that is important to the sealing of your system. I just happened to have some from a previous order from another company and will apply before using in my HVAC system.I have to order twice; the first shipment had a damaged one due to a forklift blade apparently skewering it."
5,As Advertised,"As advertised, just doesn't have the name Honeywell stamped on it. It does appear to have been made by Honeywell though because it is otherwise perfectly identical to my previous Honeywell filter and works exactly the same as well. Great product."
1,Replacement filters,They sent the wrong product and it took WAY longer than expected.We used them anyway but it is not correct.
5,This stuff is good!!!,"this sandpaper is really good because it not only sands great, but it is durable strong and lasts forever. unlike other sandpaper this doesn't loose its grit, and additionally the fact that it is made of cloth makes it all the more better.this stuff is great its the best kind of sandpaper out there!!!"
5,This book ROCKS!,"I went into my local bookstore the day Camryn's awesome book came out and made them go get me a copy from the back room. I just couldn't wait for the fun to begin. I rushed home, reading random paragraphs while waiting at stoplights, and then read her amazing story in one late-night romp, turning page after glee-filled page.I'll say it again...This book ROCKS!I suspect that people who fail to enjoy this book or see its brilliant, important point may well be reacting to the sudden lack of someone (i.e., fat folk) to whom they can feel superior. It's just a suspicion, and not all that big a deal...The point is: Camryn's book offers the common-sense-yet-oh-so-shocking notion that women of all sizes can love themselves, that we are all, fat or thin, absolutely flabulous!Rock on, Fat Sister Camryn. You're my hero!!!"
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"For any woman who has fretted going to the beach for a weekend of ""fun"" because you are afraid of the...dum dum dum...bathing suit, this book shares many of your frights as weel as hopes. Buy this book, read it, feel better about yourself, and write to the Gap. Camryn is a gem among women."
5,I'm awake now!,"I loved this book for all of the above named reasons. In addition, I had to laugh out loud when Camryn speaks with her fat and it tells her how she has been using it as an excuse. I'm the same height and weight as Camryn and I always blamed it on my height!!! (Plenty of short fat women seemed to have men, but just try to be 5'10"" and fat, and get a guy!) Too funny! Her honesty was fantastic. Finally, someone telling it like it is. I often wonder at how hard our parents work to get us to lose weight. Is it because of how they think others treat fat people, or how they know THEY treat fat people? I don't think my mother has ever gotten over my being fat. I'll pass on the book and see if it helps her. If not, that's ok. I'm wide awake and I feel fine."
3,"She's no Hemingway, but she is funny","Camryn Manhein tells of her struggle to enter the limelight. Although she attempts to express her comfort with her size, she reminds you just how uncomfortable she really is. The trials and tribulations of a woman who changed her name(it was Debbie), questioned her sexualtiy, and wondered if she could break through in television. Now, Camryn is ""pregnant"" Eleanor Frutt of the practice....But you'll notice they haven't showed her pregnant body in it's illustrious glory...not yet! Come on Eleanor...give 'em heck!! :0) As a BBW I am rooting for Camryn/Debbie...You will too!"
5,"""A painfully honest book,with a lot of spunk and GOODNESS!!""","What a wonderful book. I love her honesty and wit throughout the entire book. I could relate with many of her shared feelings and hope to begin accepting my own body like she has. Reading her life's story has given me a new view on life. She is a true inspiration to all women of substance!! This book is a MUST read, and a certain keeper. If you want to share it with your friends, but them their own copy!! This girl is the bomb!!!"
5,It made me comfortable to be me.,"Reading this book made me know that I wasn't alone in my obesity. I strongly reccomend that people of all sizes buy this book, so that they can know the hardships we face."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Ms. Manheim has a fun, easy to read writing style. Her words simply flow and her message is clear. This powerful book even added to my own self-confidence. Way to go Ms. Manheim! I'm certainly looking forward to her next book."
5,A must read!,"This is a thoroughly joyous read for anyone with body image issues, or for anyone who just enjoys a great story teller. You can hear her voice in every line."
1,Be yourself but don't let your weight determine how,"Formerly fat, and now fit for over 15 years, I resent how Manheim makes fun of the 'fat' world. It's nothing to be proud of: when your weight is out of control. It's not a laughing matter. I agree with being yourself and total, complete self-acceptance; for THAT I commend her. I also commend her for standing up for what she believes in and believing in herself so much that she didn't let her weight decide her success as an actor or author. I just resent the way she refers to the FAT population. To me, fat means lazy but it also means unfocused and uncaring of a person's person. I can take or leave Manheim but I have to agree with her on one thing: Be yourself, and you can never go wrong. That's my dogma and how I live REGARDLESS OF MY SIZE."
5,"Marry Me, Camryn!","I started reading this book out of curiosity, and quickly found I couldn't put it down. The chapter on her personals ad dates with ""Doug"" alone are enough to justify buying this book. Absolutely hilarious. Possessing a rare combination of good looks, intelligence and a sharp, genuine wit, Ms. Manheim leaves all the Baywatch cut-out Barbie doll girls that our media seem obsessed with in the dust. I hope she plans to write another."
2,Nothing of note,"Though Camryn's comments about how society treats the overweight are on target, there is little originality here, and the humour is as stale as vaudeville."
1,Not original,"What a culture we live in where the only people that are listened to are celebrities!!! The author is not writing anything original or awe inspiring that has not been written before, except those writers had less ""bankable"" names."
5,I'm Awake!,"Camryn Manheim, aside from being one of the funniest and most talented actresses of the day, is also a gifted writer. I read this book on recommendation, and it exceeded all my expectations. I could barely finish a chapter without thinking, ""I can relate!"" ""That's happened to me so many times!"" Her despcriptions of growing up in an environment that discouraged her because of her weight, of the Renaissance Faire (which I enjoy more than Christmas!!,) or going to college and studying the arts, are all things that so many young women of today can relate to. She has, in a way, become a role model for me, and I admire her so much. So read this book and see for yourself!!"
3,Jet Li's early movies,This was an ok DVD. There is a lot of content and about half is okay with a couple movies not bad. The other half is just barely okay. I could have lived without.
5,ultraman review,I'm a BIG fan of ultraman since I was a child.The remake show(Ultraman:towards the future)was great!To bad they didn't make more.
4,Frida is historically accurate,"After we watched Frida, we looked up her biography, and found it to be historically accurate, within the confines of moviedom. We visited Rockerfeller Center and saw the murals that had been originally painted by Diago, but were torn down. The art deco is amazing. We also enjoyed Evita, felt Madonna was good, but nothing compares to the play, of course. Can't say we have rewatched either movie, but would certainly recommend others viewing either one (perhaps borrowing it from the library or a friend)."
5,I have not watched Frida but have watched Evita several times.,"I believe this is an absolutely wonderful movie. At times, though, a very sad movie. Both Madonna and Antonio Banderas have excellent performances. I never get tired of watching this movie."
4,"It's a ""GOOD"" book, not a ""GREAT"" book.","The drawings and text are clear and concise for someone who wants to learn Uilleann (Irish Bellows ) bagpipe construction. The only draw back is the author assumes you have a fair amount of wood and metal working skill so some of the problems that are asscoiated with instrument building arn't covered. There is also a section on reed making. You can get more detailed information from one of the reed making books that the Uilleann pipers society sells. However, for someone who has the skills this book is clearly written and quite helpful."
5,Highly Recommended..surprisingly good,"i got this when it first came out years ago and have always loved it. kind of hard to find so buy online. miles better than jar of flies. a really amazing mini-ep. songs are slow, so if you are looking for some hard-rocking look elsewhere."
4,Incredible Harmonies!,"Their shortest album, Alice in Chains's Sap also houses some of their most compelling harmonies. The true appeal of this band was always been the harmonization of Layne Staley's vocals, with those of Jerry Cantrell, which creates a very haunting vocal performance and conveys a sense of musical emotion better than most other acts I've heard. I believe this EP uses other vocalists in the harmonies, as well as the Layne/Jerry combo, and this is the strongest vocal performance on any AiC album. It's worth owning for the first two tracks alone!"
5,Short but Sweet,"If you're an Alice in Chains fan this short EP is essencial for you. There are some pretty good tracks on this. Even the hidden track is pretty ""interesting"". Anyway probably the best track from it is of course ""Got Me Wrong"". The other tracks are pretty good too. Here are some ratings...1. Brother - 9/102. Got Me Wrong - 10/103. Right Turn - 8.5/104. Am I Inside - 9.5/105. Bonus Track 1 - 8.5/10Overall: 91% A-This is pretty much just a nice album to own if you enjoy the bands music or find it for real cheap somewhere as I did. It's good for what its worth being a short but sweet EP."
3,It's o.k.,"I used to have this, but to be honest I was tired of it after 24 hours, or at least the one song ""Got Me Wrong"". I had to play it again to see if 17 years made the difference, or not. It still isn't a classic, but I have been able to find some good in this after all. ""Brother"" sounds good, and ""Wrong Turn"" is pretty good. ""Am I Inside?"" has it's moments, but ""Got Me Wrong"" I don't think I'll ever like the song again. It's a mind tripper all right, but it turns bad with the key change, or at least in my opinion. This is just a 4 song e.p. to give the audience something new until ""Dirt"" was completed."
4,"Short EP, Short review.","This CD is neat...I guess...but it's dreadfully short for 10 bucks. And the music isn't even great stuff like Jar of Flies! It's sort of dark...but then again, so is my closet. I suppose it's got some neato songs on it, but you'd be better off buying it used!"
1,This was terrible before Clerks,"I bought this while in Philadelphia, and it was terrible except one song which I played endlessly for about a day and a half before I got tired of it, and this would eventually end up on the soundtrack of the film ""Clerks"" which was ""Got Me Wrong"". This was a noble attempt of showing that they can do acoustic as well as electric, but it didn't help if the songs weren't strong enough."
4,Alice in Chains rocks,Alice in Chains was one of my favorite grundge bands in the early 90s. The diversity of this album shows how they weren't your typical formulaic grundge band.
4,"Rerelease of an outdated, but enjoyable EP","This EP has been outdated for a decade with the release of Alice in Chains ""Music Bank."" All 4 songs can be found on that cheap 3 disc boxed set.With that being said, this is a really enjoyable, more mellow, acoustic sounding CD that goes about 17 minutes. Its short and sweet, you can drift off to sleep with how mellow songs like Brother and Am I Inside are.Got Me Wrong was on MTV and nearly every radio station in its hayday. In fact Got Me Wrong is still on alternative stations, old and new. There's a nice beat to it.Right Turn is really enjoyable, the voices of Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and singer Layne Stately blend really well. Its a good duet.For the cheap price of $7, you get some great music, but again this is a 2008 rerelease of an outdated EP. Only buy this if you don't have $30 to spend on Music Bank or if you are a collector that needs every Alice in Chains release."
5,Catechism and group discussion,"I liked this book very much. It gave not only the story from the Christian/Catholic side but also side stories as explanations and ideas to think about while going over Abraham's and Sarah's story. It's a good one, great for Christian/Catholic Groups also."
5,"If there is one to listen to, it would be Regina","One of the most dynamic vocal/song writer/pianist you will ever listen to - that IS contemporary. I dont know what makes Rap, Rap, but there is elements of it on ""Consequence of Sound.""There is much more, but it is up to you to listen to her albums. I listen to a wide range of genre: Dir En Grey, Classical.. vocal trance, techno, eletronic, house, Robin Skouteris(mash-up master), Pheonix, Leerone, Lady Gaga, Rykarda Parasol, Second Person, Cibo Matto/Miho Hatori and so on. These artists excluding the classical, all share something in common which is singing about dark things in a lovely way.. Yes, even Kyo. very very Kyo (Dir En Grey). I recommend those artists/bands.Point is, keep an open mind - there is a great collection of work out there.(student artist fine arts - Jeweler, 23y/o)"
1,This is a CD-R,"BE WARNED: This is a CD BABY Burn On Demand release.I was shocked when I got it and even more shocked no seller mentions it, not even Amazon.Comes in a cheap slim line case with poorly printed art. Piece of crap.Before you fork over $20 with shipping, know this is not overstock that someone has forgotten about and did not price out before listing it, don't think you have scored... oh no.This is a hustle, stone cold and simple, not worth it.In the words of John Lydon ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""Regina you kick ass, but why not sell this as a download on your site for like $7-$8 bucks, with a PDF of printable artwork? Results would be the same. This is an insult."
5,"Very informative, easy to understand .","I found this book through my local library after the death of my son Cameron, he was only 12 days old. After his death we were told he had HLHS. If we had been aware of his condition I think your book would have been one of the best places for us to find information."
4,"Valuable, Insightful, and Much Needed","Our baby is due in May,1999. This past Christmas we received the painful news that our little boy has HLHS. In the midst of our confusion, shock, and pain we continue to seek information as we strive to deep our understanding of HLHS and as we prepare for what lies ahead. This book has proven to be an invaluable companion. If you are expecting a child with HLHS this is one book you will want to have. If you know someone who is expecting a baby with HLHS consider this book as a gift - they will certainly appreciate it."
5,mad season,"I had this in the early 90's, lost it, and was happy to find it again; it's every bit as good as I remembered it. So, wake up young man . . ."
4,A must,"If you are an Alice fan, or a fan of 90s grunge, or a rock fan, this is an album you need to have in your collection. Few ""supergroups"" have come through for us the way Mad Season did with Above. No one that I've turned onto this CD has been disappointed. The thick layers peel away to reveal real soul. Soul in the music; soul in the musicianship; soul in the lyrics; most definitely, soul in the voice. Layne is as distinct as ever here. The elements come together greater than the sum of the parts (yeah, corny) but it's the truth. Above is an album that I've been listening to for a decade and it still holds water. If that's not the test of a truly great rock album, ask me again in another decade. I'll still likely be spinning ""Long Gone Day."""
5,like pearl jam? like alicei n chains? like this.,this band was a side project for layne staley (lead singer of alice in chains) and is the bands only album. it also has pearl jams guitarist mike mcready. it pretty much sounds like 50% pearl jam and 50% alice in chains. the album is pretty soft but great. but it walso has some songs that are more... alice in chains style. its a great listen.
3,Meh,"I was looking forward to this CD when I ordered it. Maybe the disc got switched out with something else. I really like Layne Staley and everything AIC but this album only has a couple real good songs and the rest are just ""meh."" If you're looking for AIC-esque music , this isn't it. I tried it for a couple days and it quickly got lost in the depths of my car trunk."
3,Lacking a great songwriter like Vedder/Gossard/Cantrell,"After hearing the first song, you might fall in love with this album, but dont be fooled. The album never reaches the might that is Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, probably lacking the genius of Vedder/Gossard and/or Cantrell. The album has a beautiful start but ends up in something less!"
3,It could be better,"This album have some very good songs. But just a few are really good songs. I think they would have made this album better cutting off some boring songs like that one Mark Lanegan sings. He is a great singer, but this song is very bored. Of course, Layne is an increadible musician, they made some very interesting riffs, the sadness in the songs are cool... but this album does not make me feel like when I listen to Alice in Chains."
3,It's alright.,"It doesn't sound like Alice in Chains at all, obviously cause Mad Season is it's own entity, but there are a couple of handful of songs that are good (Long Gone Day, November Hotel, River of Deceit). Not great. Most of the album is dull and predictable. I'd only recommend buying a used copy. It'd be cheaper."
3,Bleak Rock From Seattle,"Layne Stayley's voice is unmistakable. And just because he is partners here with guitarist Mike McCready(Pearl Jam) and Mark Lanegan(Screaming Trees) doesn't change that a bit. Songs here recall dark minimalist 70's rock, especially the beautiful ""River Of Deceit"" and the Stayley diary of ""Long Gone Day."" McCready shows his love for Zeppelin in the single string riffs of ""Lifeless Dead"" and the swirling ""I'm Above,""(where Lanegan helps out on vocals.) The bong hit moodiness of this record is mesmerizing, but often sounds like a sleepy jam session, which was probably the whole idea of the record to begin with. On a sad note, Stayley and bassist Baker Saunders both later died from heroin overdoses."
5,Must have for Staley fans!,"members from two of my favorite bands, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains combine on the only Mad Season album ever. Most prominent is the late layne Staley. Staley is one of the best rock vocalists of all time. Right up there not only with his contemporaries Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder, but with classic rock's greatest frontmen; Robert Plant, Mick Jagger,Roger Daltry, the list goes on. Staley's unique delivery works well not only on hard rocking albums like Facelift and Dirt, but also on quieter albums such as Jar Of Flies, Sap, and AIC Unplugged. The softer side is displayed throughout this album.This is one of the most successful side projects ever assembled, right alongside the brilliant Temple Of The Dog. After you get this album, get the VHS (not on dvd yet) performance of Mad Season Live, it shows Layne's unique gift as a live performer. We miss ya Layne."
4,An essential listen from the first half of the '90s.,"Above is a must-have album for fans of Layne Staley, Mike McCready, or of course the era and the music that went along with it.Less manic and more subtle than the archetypal Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam albums, Mad Season and Above are an incredible but at times frustrating listen. While the album as a whole is somewhat uneven, beautiful tracks like Wake Up, River of Deceit and the latin-tinged Long Gone Day showcase that incredible potential for creativity and change that seemed to be everywhere in the early '90s. Sadly, this potential was never realized as most of the important bands have either split or lost members due in large part to the daemons that drove their projects in the first place.Still, at certain moments Above provides a glimpse into a deeper, more sophisticated 'grunge' (a stupid, inaccurate term, but it is useful here) that was never fully realized."
5,Great Album,"The true testament to a good musician is how versatile one is. This album demonstrates how good each member of this band really is. Any doubters, listen to November Hotel, quite simply one of the greatest pieces of music in rock history. This album, a long time ago when I bought it inspired me to learn to play music. There are few albums that are as good from beginning to end that are so downright enjoyable on so many fronts. Whether you like the voice, the music, the atmosphere, you will definitely find something worthwhile. Buy this album."
1,"Too adventureous for my listening pleasure, unlike Werner's intelligent trio dates!","Pianist Kenny Werner's Lawn Chair Society is a cerebral mix of acoustic jazz, electronic elements and generally expansive improvisation that comes and goes in unexpected directions and to me very dis-jointed directions!"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for the track ""Uncovered Heart"", after hearing it on our local jazz station and being swept away by its soft lyric beauty. If you are looking for more like it on this album, you will find it only in parts of the ""Kothbiro"" track. The other tracks are in an edgier, more disjointed style that I associate with the 1970s and never got into enough to characterize. But ""Uncovered Heart"" exudes the same warmth and poignancy that drew me to it when I first heard it."
5,"brilliant, deeply-satisfying album","Mr. Werner has always blazed his own distinctive trails as composer, soloist and band member and, on this album, he takes the listener far into the deep places artists go to express the inexpressible in life. The band is phenomenal and completely in sync with him, frequently taking front and center roles on the various cuts. A very personal album, ""deep"" in all its meanings, this ranks up there with the Shorter/Hancock ""1+1"" album in the strength, compassion and raw emotion it conveys."
3,Mustang Recognition Guide,I was disappointed the cover on the book was not the same as pictured. I have read this book in the past and I am not sure if the contents are the same as pictured
2,15 Seconds: Why this probably isn't the book you want,"While I am certainly a novice genealogist compared to the author, I am able to organize file folders and make tabs line up in files or three ring binders. The book, as short as it is, explains in excruciating detail how to set up ""couples"" based genealogy files. The first half decribes it for file folders, the second half basically repeats the first half only for three ring binders. If you need explicit details on how to label tabs and make them line up and use color coding this book may hold value for you. However, be prepared for poor editing which abounds. If you have basic organizational and labeling skills then get ""Organizing Your Family History Search"" by Sharon Carmack. The only reason this got two stars is because there may actually be people out there that are so bad at organizing files that this book may add value for them. I sent mine back. This is the first book I've ever sent back to Amazon.com and I've bought dozens."
1,Organizational Book That Added to the Confusion,"I purchased this book to help me learn more about different systems that could be used to organize the inevitable pile of papers that accrue for most genealogists. After reading the book (and rereading it in case I really just missed the point), I still can't understand how Mr. Langman suggests these miscellaneous papers be organized.He recommends a color tabbed system that includes your four main surmanes and couples that is simple, but never explaines how the system can accomodate more than 5 generations. He simply repeats himself and makes confusing statements about the types of records that should be stored in the files.This book does not give value to anyone who has even rudimentary organizational skills. Consider other genealogy books for a more thorough explanation of organizational systems for genealogists."
2,some helpful hints for organization,"Helpful hints are given, but not that many. The price is too much for what is in the book. The material could have been presented in a much shorter, and less expensive, book."
2,"and after this, the patient died . . .","This album marked the end of the second version of the Allman Brothers Band. A close listen reveals they were already on their last legs.Three good songs emerge, however. ""Can't Lose What You Never Had"" is as rockin' a hard blues number as they ever recorded. Just a phenomenal performance, makes you wonder what it's doing on such an otherwise lifeless album.""Win, Lose or Draw"" may contain the best lyrics Gregg Allman has ever written, but it suffers from an uncharacteristically weak vocal performance.""High Falls"" is a jazzy instrumental which features a spacey introduction which recalls ""Les Brers in A Minor"" from Eat a Peach. Chuck Leavell's electric piano is especially noteworthy here.The rest of the album is filler, and not especially good filler. In fact, ""Louisiana Lou"" may be the worst song they ever recorded."
2,The ABB runs out of gas,"After releasing five consecutive classic albums in a row, the Allman Brothers Band took two years to release the Win, Lose, or Draw album. This is a very unfocused release with few memorable songs. The band was going through some turmoil at the time and it reflected in the music. They continued to go more towards a country sound with Dickey Betts' ""Just Another Love Song"" and ""Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John."" The only two tracks that recall their earlier albums are their cover of Muddy Waters' ""Can't Lose What You Never Had"" and the Dickey Betts instrumental ""High Falls."" While ""High Falls"" is never mentioned among their great instrumental tracks, it's an excellent track and the high point of the album. The other tracks aren't up to their usual excellent standard."
2,ABB loses,"Allman Bothers on the fall. Louisiana Lou And Three Card Monty John , a fast one. High Falls , above standard instrumental. This album is the indicator that ABB can not come up with any classic albums like their early and mid-70s albums. However, the instrumental wizard D. Betts shows no sign of weariness on writing the High Falls. High Falls is comparable to In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Les Brers in A Minor and Jessica. Country style turned Allman Brothers, on this album, can not cheer up. These guys are Southern Rockers, the genre constricted by the mid-70s, and this album clearly bears that mark. This album can be bought just because of its date(that is in range of 70s albums). But the question is does it worth the buck? ABB's decline signs surface as they enter the 80s, that is truely due to the fact of a constricted genre. Maybe you should get yourself an 80s effort by Molly Hatchet, instead."
3,4 great songs,"I would only get this one after you have the other great Allman albums (their 1st five, Enlightened Rogues, and anything in the 1990s--Seven Turns, Where It All Begins etc). There are 4 top notch songs on here though - Can't Loose What You Never Had, Win Loose or Draw, Nevertheless and High Falls would stack up well on any Allman's album. The rest aren't that good. Chuck Leveal does plays well throughout this album. The band just lost their focus by 1975 and really only made half the album up to their previous and current high standards."
4,Entirely worth it for High Falls.,"Too bad it's not available for download. Dicky Betts' song High Falls marks the end of a very special era for the ABB. Such delicate and musical playing would soon disappear, to be replaced by much stronger stuff. Good stronger stuff, but I swear you can hear the Eat A Peach muse around every corner."
4,slide guitar is exceptional,"Under rated recording, slide guitar is exceptional. Cd version enhances highs/trebles which makes more listenable than its lp formatfor 20 word limit. Better to shorten word limit so review can be clear and concise without having to read reviews like e.g. this cd rules, this cd sucks etc"
3,Got it for HIGH FALLS,"Wanted the 14minute+ HIGH FALLS to put on my I-POD. I-Tunes wont let you buy it as a single so I had to get the cd. The rest is OK, but HIGH FALLS was the draw for me-great long cardio tune."
3,How high the mighty have fallen,"This album is mostly a huge dissapointment. Most of the songs sound like the Bros. have mailed it in...with the exception of'High Falls'. This is simply the greatest instrumental the Allmans have ever recorded, and possibly the greatest song ever recorded by the Allman Brothers Band. At fifteen minutes long, it rescues the album, and then some. The soaring solos sound like eagles...I sing this song in my mind whenever I visit my favorite waterfall in the Adirondacks...rarely do you encounter something as spellbinding as this on such a mediocre album. It just might make my list of desert island recordings..."
4,The Future of Music,"Deadsy is one of those few bands that successfully blends a variety of sounds to create a truly unique sound. Not only are the songs on Commencement very origional; mixing goth, new wave, and Bowie-esque rock and roll; but the sound of this album is like nothing I have heard on a major label release before. I can't decide if what I am hearing is a breakthrough in modern sound production or the cheapest sounding album I have heard since the earliest DIY punk material. The guitar sounds manage to be both dry and saturated at the same time. It truly defies any explanation I can come up with. Deadsy is a band that I hope stays around for years to come."
2,"I really want to like this, but I just can't","Just some background, I am a senior music education major at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. I have taken 5 theory courses and 3 music history courses. This background definitely influenced my decisions about this music. As the first track begins to play one may compare this to any pre-classical or early classical oratorio. But, as the pieces drag on (and I mean draaag) one will hear many chord shifts that just do not make sense. I literally cringe when it comes to some of the passages. This is not to say that it is all bad, there are some tonal conventions that have not been undermined. However, the fact that any have not been followed makes this work lose it's luster. This is not classical nor neoclassical, it is an attempt at classical with bad part writing."
2,Simple but beautiful,"This music is so simple that any reputable conservatory composition student would be declined admission if they submitted this score as their audition piece, yet because it is Paul McCartney, I am sure the music will sell. It is beautiful, I will give him that, but a child with some basic theory training could also write something beautiful too - if they put their heart and mind to it.This would make a great movie score - it does evoke some emotion - but the musicians would be bored out of their minds playing all those whole notes.I give this album 2 stars on the shear merit that it makes great background music, but if you are into serious listening, I would pass this one by."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed. I was wanting some relaxing music from Paul... I had heard some of his classical stuff in the past, but I didn't care at all for this opera style music. Oh well. I still love Paul."
5,Inspired and Inspiring!,"This is a fully-realized, rich and inspiring work. Having not listened to Paul's other classical discs, but being a fan of English oratorios, I wasn't sure what to expect. This is pure bliss."
2,Beware - reprint of an old book,I am amazed that Amazon does not mention that this is a reprint of a very old book
4,Books Cover,"""In Young Wives Overseas, S.L. Williams explores a realm new to the American novel: the lives of three girls and their Army husbands on a military base in Germany. These young women find themselves in two strange cultures, a foreign country's and the U.S.Military's. Williams brings his characters alive with surprising vividness, and creates a story that quickly becomes a page-turner, as each of these distinctively different girls deal with drugs, wife-swapping parties, prostitution, poverty, sudden wealth and the strains of GI life in post-Cold-War Europe. They come from such different backgrounds as working-class Kentucky, sex-for-sale New Orleans and family-values Georgia. And each finds her own unique way to cope with unexpected challenges"""
1,Wouldn't Recommend,"I am an avid fan of weddings and collect books and magazines in relation to them. I was not impressed with this book at all and if I had the choice again, would not buy it. I would not recommend this book at all - I would recommend instead ""Hollywood Gets Married"" by Sandy Scheier."
4,Beautiful drone soundtrack for the mind,"Australian space pop band Drop City's Matthew J Tow's solo project. Think air and space and a soundtrack for dreams. Lo fi. Close your eyes and open your mind and float and swim behind Mr Tow as he weaves his beautiful magic piper music. Colorsound have also released ""Soundtrack to an Imaginary life"" and ""Auspicious Beginnings"" the new album will be released late 2000. Highly recommended and even more so ""Soundtrack to an Imaginary Life"" is too beautiful."
2,Not what I was looking for,The DVD does not come with a discussion guide or anything that would help navigate through the material (contrary to the picture you see which give you the impression that a discussion guide comes with it). Disappointing.
2,subversive...,"Giuseppe Alberigo, who has written what is said to be the definitive history of the Council (5 volumes) seems to be at odds in his hermenutic of the Council in comparison with Benedict XVI's address to the Curia in December of 2005 where an interpretation of Vatican II as ""rupture"" was shown as false while one of ""continuity"" was highlighted and endorsed. I hope and pray that the Holy Father (and the Holy Spirit?/!)is not being thwarted in efforts to implement the 21st ecumenical council."
5,AWESOME HOPPER:),This is the BEST hopper ever. Whatever gun you have I guarantee this hopper can keep up. The feed rate is 22+ bps(balls per second). This hopper is sound activated so it will work with any paint. This hopper never jams. This hopper can run on 4 or 6 AA batteries. This hopper has an led light that displays when the batteries are low. The force feed technology ensures consistent ball feed. This hopper also has a magnetic lid so it is easy to load.
1,Are you kidding me?,$108.50??? Are you kidding me? Let alone the $179.99 starting price. This Hopper is $89.95 if you get it directly from Empire. Why on earth anyone would over pay for this is beyond me.
1,One of the worst books ever,Two things first:(1)Robert Devereaux RULES.(2)I have no problem with the eroticization of Santa Claus(about time SOMEONE did)but I do have a problem with the way he did it.Devereaux's other stuff is much better than this crap.
5,Have yourself a merry little Christmas.,"I have never - and I mean never - read a book quite like this. Robert Devereaux has taken the mythical figures of our childhood and recast them as the pagan hedonistic gods they were. Santa begins a torrid affair with the Tooth Fairy. The Easter Bunny is a Peeping Tom. Mrs. Claus plots her revenge. This is the filthiest, funniest most original book I've read in years. It comes in a beautiful signed edition limited to 1000 copies. Get it while you can. This is cutting edge fiction at its best."
1,Okay...,"I was excited to read this book because it sounded so different but after finishing it I feel I must take a mental shower! This book was total trash! I've read most of the reviews about this novel beforehand thinking that I didn't want to be one of those easily offended, shallow person that would not understand or enjoy the paradox or humor of this story. I am very open minded and grasp anything different. This story was just plain stupid after awhile. While reading I was thinking to myself, Jeez who's going to have sex with whom now? So & So with So & So? Then sure enough!The author was obviously in dire need of some. I would not recommend this book. I gave it 1 star just for originality."
2,Bizarre!,"Never before in my life have I read anything even remotely similar to this. That being said, I am none too sure I would ever want to read anything similar to this again. This was one strange read. Recasting our familiar beloved Santa, Tooth Fairy & Easter Bunny as strange sex fiends was a bit much for me to handle. I anticipated this to be much more of fairy tale than the raunchy read that it was. I have to say it, I was dissappointed."
2,What's with the squeak?,"The shoes themselves are comfortable and I would be inclined to buy another pair if not for their tendency to squeak. Both shoes squeak when I lift up the heel. I have read other posts about J&M shoes having similar problems. For a $200 pair of shoes to squeak is not acceptable. I shouldn't have to try powder, vaseline or WD-40 to alleviate the noise in a pair of shoes that are supposed to be of high quality. I have contacted the company directly and we'll see if they respond."
4,Pendragon World,"''Not of this World'' is a good example of neo-progrock, melodic, rocky, a bit of psychedelia. The main song of course is ''If I were wind''. For me its wery emotional, melodic, amazing. Album is wery good, high professional real prog rock."
4,Pendragon - Not Quite As Good As The Previous Album,"It was going to be hard to follow up the excellent ""Masquerade Overture"", but Pendragon gave it a good shot with this album. I don't like it quite as well, but it is another very nice release from the band with plenty of their trademark bombastic progressive rock. In spots this is probably one of the bands heaviest releases musically. There is plenty of great melodic guitar and Clive Nolan's keys are up front and in your face. Everything is very good, but for some reason I don't think it is quite up to the level of it's predecessor. If you are a Pendragon fan you should enjoy this one. If not there is not much here that is going to change your mind."
4,In the vein of Masquerade...,"After the great success of Masquerade Overture, I was eager waiting the next Pendragon's studio album. How could the band manage to create new music with the same qualitiy as it predecessor? I have to say that the outcome didn't disappoint me at all! This is really a very good album. Pendragon reached a level of maturity only seen in the great bands of the genre. ""Not of this world"" suite is simply terrific."
1,Disappointment ! ! !,"Nothing Special, No Melody, No Harmony,, NOTHING.Kinda Marillion, and not the Best one..P.S.only Cover work and Lyrics are nice."
5,Great Wax,Great Wax - Easy to remove and makes the car look great. I generally buy a bottle of this at my local Menards's store for less than $6. This was the top rated was in the last Consumer Reports ratings. Made in USA!
4,Deep shine for great price,"I actually bought this years ago at a Dollar General store down here in F.L. for $5. I must say application is easy as is removal. It also creates a great shine on older vehicles.The cons are basically it attracts quite a bit of dust and it doesn't last long (as with most Waxes). But all in all if your're a wax gux and are looking for something that has a great price to performance ratio, I see no reason not to go for it."
1,turtle junk,i found that this product was to hard to take off and dusty. there has to be something better.
3,just soso,"I got the book today,the time is so long,i unhappy as open it , the book is very old ,but the book content is good for me ,so i don't wanna return it."
3,"Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!","For an independent film, this is well done. However, it does require a suspension of disbelief to watch and enjoy it. I have never seen a coffeehouse that huge before (maybe they're bigger in England). Nobody gets any work done and everybody swears like drunken truckdrivers on crank. And all anyone can think about are their ""relationships"". Marsha Thomason's character is the only sane one there (and to tell you the truth, she should have shown much more skin). I recommend this for Marsha Thomason fans (like me) or closet Anglophiles, but for others I would buy Waiting... instead."
2,Such a waste of talent and time!,I kept waiting for this movie to earn the ratings that it had... Total waste of time! The characters are annoying and the storyline make me fidgety and nervous. I do not recommend this film at all.
2,THIS CAFFEINE HAS NO ZIP!,"I really expected more from this film because of the excellent cast, but other than a few good scenes this film just sits there. The endless chatter is neither funny nor interesting for the most part and I found myself wanting this film to just end.As independent films goes this is one of most disappointing ones I've seen. There are a few shinning moments in this scattered tale about nothing, but there are so many better films out there, it just isn't worth your time."
4,A Classic,"Virtually every really knowledgable writer of books on pike fishing ,that I have read , puts this book by Kit Bergh on their list of recommended reading . I can see why . In the last few months I have , at last , got my hands on a copy . I am delighted . Although this book was published in 1975 , and thus may be viewed by some people as dated , I found it packed with timeless information . It is a true classic and a great read ."
5,Foer is a hero,"Who knew that modern Kashrut was such a farce? THANK YOU, Jonathan, for opening so many peoples' eyes. (And WHY have so many people been so quiet until now about the horrific violations of what Jews have been instructed to hold so sacred?)"
4,Phew! I'm Exhausted,"I don't know where to begin...this book was everything you could emotionally experience. Happy, sad, frustrating, engrossed, boring, exciting. Very rarely does a book keep me so absorbed that I stay up past midnight: this one did. Make sure you read Kilgannon first; both books go together. What a ride! It's on my keeper shelf."
1,Very Disapointed,I was so anxious to read this book I could not wait for it to be available on my Kindle so I ordered it in paperback. It was very tedious just going over and over the same territory and past history. I think the author just published it have something to rehash. His term in prison went on and on. The author should sharpen his pencil.
3,"Lots of typos in kindle edition, story was OK","I bought this one after reading the precursor, Kilgannon, which I liked quite a bit. This was was a little too much like Outlander. I wouldn't spend $5 on it."
4,Better than the first,"This one picks up right where the first left off! Begins in Scotland with the rebellion beginning. Once captured, he is taken to London to stand trial for treason. Mary and the boys follow to launch a campaign in society for his release while the clansmen take a different route for Alex's freedom.Keep your tissues nearby! While the first book was very romantic, this one is a real tearjerker! I found myself cheering Mary on while, at the same time, wondering how she could continue to cope.The author shows MUCH research in her work and is very knowledgeable on the time's laws, customs, etc. I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the third in this trilogy, which is to be released in Dec. 1999."
3,Much better than the first,I was very disappointed after reading Kilgannon and questioned whether or not to even read this book. After completing it I am glad that I did. This second book in the series was much better written than the first and definitely more interesting. I think that Kilgannon and The Wild Rose of Kilgannon should have been made into one book instead of two. I think that people would have been more receptive to the story had it been complete given that Kilgannon was more like an introduction and not an entire story.
5,Great story!,"The Wild Rose picks up where Kilgannon ended, with Alex going off to war. The suspense was high from the first page and I finally had to peek to see if Alex lives and if Alex and Mary ever get back together. The story moves from Kilgannon to Edinburgh to London and I couldn't put it down! I can't get enough of Alex and, like Mary, I'll go anywhere to be with this man. I love discovering a new writer and I will read everything Kathleen Givens writes. The two Kilgannon novels are keepers! I'm anxious for the third."
5,Greatest Baking Pan Ever Made,"My Grandmother & Mother used these pans. You can bake anything on them and ""it won't burn"" They are great for everthing from baked goods to meat and fish. I use one at least 4 times a week.They are hard to find in the stores, I'm glad I found them on Amazon."
5,No more burnt cookies!,"These are the best cookie pans ever! I have tried to bake cookies in certain older ovens when I'm traveling, and they always seem to burn on the bottoms before the tops get done. My father-in-law suggested I try one of his AirBake pans, and the cookies came out perfect every time! I highly suggest the AirBake pans and sheets. They're wonderful, especially for cookies."
4,"Baking pan ""Air Bake""",I am enjoying both of the baking pans. They are perfect for the Texas sheet cake and the Buttermilk Brownies. I got raves on both.
5,"Victoria, what a Victor you are!","I think this book is wonderful, as far as vocal selections go. Every song brings back memories of the Broadway production and movie ""Victor/Victoria"", both with Dame Julie Andrews. My personal favorite, ""Crazy World"", can still bring a tear to my eye. It's worth buying-it'll bring much enjoyment. And many fond mem'ries."
5,Bite Size Bedtime Reading,"All of the Burgess books work at bedtime. Short chapters allow for a brief or an extended story time as sneaky non-sleepy kids ask for just one more. The stories are calm but interesting. The characters are appealing but not at all cutesy. These are not twee or arch or sugary. They are just good, simple, well constructed, gentle tales - some with messages and lessons, some not. There are lots of pre-war classics still in print, but for our money this set has aged the best. The all time favorite at our house was Danny Meadow Mouse, but each featured character has its own appeal. While there are a lot of the Burgess books, you can jump in anywhere; there is no over arching storyline that you need to follow."
5,Love it!,I love this 2 CD set. My favorite is disc 2 though. It's so relaxing! I've been looking for the perfect downbeat trance type sound to use in my massage room. This one fit exactly!
5,stephan luke is really good,"I don't know about the rest of this album's artists, but Stephan Luke is really good. I heard his song 'Cosmic' on Pandora (where you tell this artificial intelligence music you like, and it finds other music which is similar in structure or appeal), after entering 'thievery corporation'.Stephan, if you read this, I hope you make it in the music biz, because your music is great."
4,Great Book,It has mainly traditional names in it. (more so than any other book i had looked at). Plus it has great little tidbits mixed in!
3,"Good-but lacked that special ""stand out"" unique names.","This book offered many names I never knew existed. In that sense it was good. However, it did not offer anything that I felt was unique and beautiful together. Sure, there are some foreign names I never knew. But they don't stand out as names to necessarily give my children."
2,Not what I was expected,"While this is a very subjective review, as any opinion on names/naming is, I was very disappointed with the quality of this book. The variety of names included is rather limited and they are all very cultural names, mainly European. I felt the majority of the names were too unusual, too difficult to pronounce, or just plain ugly.The one positive thing I can say about this book is that if you are looking for a truly unique name that you've never encountered before, this book will provide that. Not many 'trendy' or 'popular' names in this book -- as I said the style of names is more old fashioned/ethnic names.For me though, this book is not a keeper."
2,Dissapointing and not properly researched.,"The third edition of this book has not benefited fron the mistakes of the past two editions. For instance: the chapter on ""stereotypes"" is curious as it is based a British article in the 1963 ( a bit dated!) that does not even exist!!"
1,Wish This Book Weren't Here,"How bad does a book have to be for a person to spend his time giving it a one-star review years after he read it? ""Wish You Were Here"" is the book, and the answer is real bad. I've read my share of books for which no tree should have ever been sacrificed, but this one stands out. One reviewer suggested reading the first page and the last page, nothing more. I agree. There is nothing of value in this book. There is no central plot. Nothing of interest happens. Sure, the attention to detail is precise - about 454 pages worth, if I recall - but that doesn't make a novel. As a literary exercise, it might have some merit for the writer, but the reader would be better off reading the tags on every item of clothing they own. Avoid this book, and if it is forced upon you, gouge your eyes out."
2,Character driven novel about ongoing dysfunction,"I can not speak for anyone but myself when I say that I found this book missing something. I checked it out of the library solely on the level of seeing different generations interact. I did see that in this book, but found most of them, save maybe Arlene, amazingly dull and shallow. I wonder if the writer would have been better off to focus on a smaller group, really getting to their deepest levels.I found myself becoming infuriated by the characters inability to say how they really feel. The dysfunction continues in this family because no one is willing to say what is bothering them, from the mother, to the alcoholic daughter, to the bitter wife. There is no conclusion in this book....just stories hanging in the wind."
2,Where's the STORY?,"As others have mentioned, wonderful characterizations, the writing is good, but there is no story. I love good character development and detail to surroundings, but these elements should be integrated into some kind of story-line, and THERE ISN'T ONE! What a waste of my time (and money!)."
1,a waste of a week,591 pages and I'm still wondering what the point was. This author seemed to miss the basic premise that a novel should have some sort of climax or the characters should have some sort of revelation but nothing happens. Even the case of a missing girl goes unresolved. None of the characters is likeable so reading this book is like spending a week with people you don't like in a place you really don't want to be and then having to watch vacation photos of the whole experience.
2,An Epic About Nothing,"Halfway through, I thought I was enjoying the book. Until I realized that I really disliked all the characters.I admire the way O'Nan took on such a large cast, and rotated the points of view, but so much was heavy-handed. Yes, it was very, very clear that O'Nan researched photography. Those details screamed ""AUTHOR'S RESEARCH! AUTHOR'S RESEARCH!"" And he seemed to classify each character by one or two traits, and then return to those each time he presented that character's point of view: the scared boy, the bitter wife, the smart girl with a secret, etc.I don't generally mind a character-driven book in which nothing much happens. But I expect other payoffs: humor, precise characterization, unique observations. I learned a bit about Chautauqua and Niagara Falls, but I was hoping for more."
3,Tease,"I started with recent O'Nan and worked my way back. While this is touted as one of his best works, I found the book to be a teaser, dangling the possibility of action which never came. That said, his characters are rich and well developed, and he nails the dynamics of family life."
2,Wish You Were Here,A little too wordy - almost a stream of thoughts - like a soap opera - didn't move along or create any excitement as to what was going to happen next...felt like I was just peeking in someone's window...nothing new here.
2,Big Disappointing Yawn........,"I was looking so forward to reading this BIG book by Stewart O'Nan..I think he is a wonderful story teller. However, I prefer his slim, elegant and minimalistic novels (almost novellas) to this big old book about nothing going on...just goes on and on and on and on and I am simply bored with it. I am disappointed...I think he bit off more than he could chew. The characters are lackluster, one dimensional and inspired nothing but apathy from me. Another one bites the dust....I am not finishing this one."
2,Depends what you're looking for,"Look, I'm willing to concede that it's very well done for what it is... an detailed exploration of the minds of the family members, and an examination of complex family dynamics.However, this was 500 pages of pretty much the same thing, over and over. I felt like I pretty much knew each character within 5 pages of their introduction, and there's almost no character evolution. The author (whose other books I've greatly enjoyed) lavishes them with detail, but I don't feel the least bit enriched by the experience."
1,so bad i didn't even finish it - which I NEVER do,"Just couldn't get through it. Being from and living in Buffalo I thought I would enjoy it, aside from references to certain things Buffalo or Western New York, I didn't enjoy anything about the half of the book that I read. It was so dull, day to day to boring endless day of each characters actions and nothing really exciting happens to anyone. It just went on and on.............."
1,I Can't Believe I Read the Whole Thing!,I basically bought this book because the story takes place in the area where I live. That ends up being the only thing of interest in the entire book. This author has managed to fill 500 pages without saying a thing. Not one of the characters had a non-depressing thought or conversation and even the weather was miserable for the most part. The only thing I enjoyed about this book was being finished with it. I can't believe I wasted all that time on reading through it. I just couldn't believe the book would end without something happening.
2,The most boring book I ever read,"In all my 79 years, this was one of the least interesting books I've seen through to the end. I continued reading it, rather than tossing it in the recycle bin, because I was trying not to think of the death of a friend.In the story, there was no character development or depth. No one engaged me at any level for more than two sentences. The pace was slower than a snail's, and there was no plot. The only event in the book that sparked interest was left hanging. Reading the book was like reading a transcription of a security camera filming a dull family for a week.Perhaps this was the author's intention, and if so, he succeeded. I have nothing against this person; his book just did not appeal to me."
1,Boring and Unappealing,"It is rare that I give a book a bad review, but I feel no qualms about this one. This book is big on mundane details, short on plot. This could work, given its description of the region, but its flawed in its multiple inaccurate descriptions of the Western New York area (where I grew up) which other reviewers have commented on. Add unsympathetic characters to the mix, and you have an unappealing book built on negative emotions. This isn't my style."
1,Frustrating and slow...,"I was determined to finish the entire book, and I did...finally. The details are what got me. There was not much of a story, so the author had to fill the book with details. Loading the dishwasher, cleaning the cabinets, the damn ants in the mailbox. Who cares? Where is the story? The family was annoying: Kenneth who couldnt follow through on a single project he wanted to do, Margaret fighting for the house until she realized she could get money instead, Emily so wrapped up in the mundane details of day to day chores because she has nothing better to do. It was really hard for me to follow these people through a day, let alone an entire week. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Y-A-W-N!,"I have a personal policy to always finish the book that I am reading. This book is making me change my views. I have been struggling for the past two weeks to get through this book. It is boring and the characters are wholly unlikeable. Lise is someone I am glad does not exist - what a shrew! In any story, there should be some kind of plot, some kind of rising action. There is nothing in this book, just days and days of mundane stuff. I feel as caged in by this book, as the characters felt having to get through the rainy days at the cabin. Don't waste a single minute on this book!"
3,"Great writer, tedious novel","As others have pointed out, the level of detail in this book is overwhelming. I appreciate being able to view situations through all of the characters' eyes, and it's a clever idea, but I really didn't need to know that much about every moment of every day.I will say I liked the suspense built in through the kidnapping early in the book, and the alarm being triggered at a neighbor's house, and the very realistic way that resolved (or rather, didn't resolve.)Additionally, I felt the portrayal of family tensions was very realistic and I could relate to quite a few of the viewpoints.But honestly, I found myself impatient with the characters and impatient with the pace of the book."
1,how to list chores,"wash windows, sweep floors, make beds, clean out closets, get bored with a visit to niagra, change gears, buy hamburgers, find lost screws (who ever lost a screw?)..."
1,Got insomnia? Here is the cure.,"Worst book I've read in a very long time. There is no story. Don't wait for it, as I did, slogging through 500 pages. If you randomly chose three generations of people and put them in a cabin for a week and then read their diaries, it would be more interesting and probably more cohesive than this prescription-strength sleeping pill. I'm just glad these people sold their cottage so I won't run into any of them at Chautauqua!"
5,Good Clean Family Fun,"Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion stars the beautiful and talented Japanese actress Meiko Kaji, best known for playing Lady Snowblood and singing ""Flower of Carnage,"" the title song to Kill Bill. This movie has everything to be a fine example of the ""women in prison"" film genre: stabbings, shootings, rape, lesbian sex, torture (scaldings, beatings, burnings, women hung by ropes from their elbows) and lots and lots of female nudity. Good clean family entertainment. What more could you want?"
5,great film,"I have to say this is one of my all time favorite films. I love the opening credits its just naked japanese women everywhere. This movie is loaded with sex, nudity, and violence. If you are a fan of japanese exploitaion films from the 70's you will love this"
3,On and on and on...,"A fairly easy read given the time period in which it was written, but too long; it just kept going on and on and on. By the time I was ready for it to end, the ending was still hundreds of pages away. Nevertheless, very much appreciated the strength of the heroine Marian, and was equally irritated by the weak and excessively ""fragile"" victim Laura. Overall the character development was quite good and clearly defined the role of each. For a mystery I found there to be some early foreshadowing that I thought made for some predictability in latter parts of the story, causing perhaps later plot twists to lose some of their impact."
5,Excellent classic thriller.,"I didn't think this would be my type of book, but I ended up loving it. Much better than other Collins reading, in my opinion."
4,"A Mystery Classic of the Highest Caliber, but not the best..","I give this book 4 stars due to its extraordinary characters and great ideas. However, it is not the 'greatest' mystery ever, I think there are so many other books in this genre that are even better. Wilkie Collins was a bit long-winded, as many mystery writers are apt to be, but he excelled in creating an unforgettable, haunting story."
5,"action , mystery and odd charactors","The woman in white is one of those books you can't put down , the charactors are strange and interesting . It also gives the reader a glimpse of what life was like for women in europe in the early eighteen hundreds"
4,Great gothic read,Complex and gothic read of the period. I can highly recommend its twisting plot and dark atmosphere. What devious creatures.
4,Classic,What can I say! It's a classic. Beautifully written. It's vivid portrayal of Victorian England takes you to a journey you never experienced before.
3,Unique book,"Wilke Collins' approach writing from the perspective of the main characters was unique and intriguing. Collins' differentiation of the characters' emotional and moral perspective is what held my interest. My response to the actions and motives of the characters ran from infatuated to infuriated to frustrated to admiration (and many points in between.) Being an elder baby boomer, I found the verbiage and pace often ponderous and annoying early on but relaxed into style as I got into the book. Most impressively Collins is able to take twists and turns in the story because of his characters diverse and perverse moral development.I highly recommend this book for the avid, adventurous, thoughtful and perseverant reader. Not for someone looking for escape with mindless entertainment."
4,A Complete Weave of Historical and Mysterious Fiction,"Excellent read and very well written. The book had several layers, but sequentially and intricately weaved into the story to make an honorable finish.This is an over looked classic. For those of you who would like a great story to read on a long weekend that's full of intrigue, I recommend."
5,A classic,"If you are a Kindle user, this is a no-brainer purchase. Buy this book (free of charge) and enjoy a wonderful trip to a different time, full of suspense and romance, richly drawn characters and a unique form of story-telling. I won't give anything away, but it's a delicious read."
4,Good book!!!,"ok so i thought this was a great book.it was interesting well written and had gripping drama. i loved how it had some humorous characters and how well the characters were deleloped was great to. i am a kid that really likes a lot of humor (good humor, that is) in books. so i really loved how theh had the creepy/mystery element to it but it also had just those great characters that were interesting and some of them funny. the only reason j am giving this book a four star is because it got just a little bit slow nearer the end."
5,An Unsurpassed Masterpiece,"I ""read"" this book in my car as a book-on-tape. This book listens superbly because it is composed as a series of narratives, and the different readers bring the different narratives to life. Whatever you do, DO NOT READ OR LISTEN TO THE ABRIDGED VERSION as suggested by one misguided editorial review. As you will see by glancing at the other reviews, when you finish the complete version, your piercing regret will be that there is no more. This book is a stunning, perhaps unique, combination of depth and suspense. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be enthralled as it moves from climax to climax. Do yourself a favor and read as little as possible about the plot before starting the book, so that you can fully appreciate its uncanny spell."
5,Captivating,So interesting of a style of communicating the story and what a plot and characters! Best from Wilkie Collins in my opinion.
4,Elegantly uncivilised,"The social constraints placed upon English women at the time heightens the tension and helplessness felt throughout the reading. Thankfully, Walter is not the invincible Knight in shining armour but a real man set against dangerous men. He must be tenacious and clever, aided by the brave female friend to save all and claim justice. Old language for a fresh story."
4,Very entertaining and it was free!,I really enjoyed The Woman in White. The story was full of mystery and surprises all along the way. I couldn't put the book down -- especially toward the end!
5,Why the classics are classic,"The Woman in White (Penguin Classics)Murky figures emerging from the darkness, confused identities, heroic heros and multi-dimensional villains--this novel has them all. With a plot twisting and turning like a snake, Collins' novel is a compulsive read and a fully satisfying one."
4,Intriguing but so very long,"I enjoyed this book but it could have been about 200-300 pages shorter and still told a captivating story. I was tempted to give up when I saw how slowly the plot was unfolding, but I'm glad I kept going because it really is an interesting book with many finely interwoven plot lines. The characters were detailed so well that I felt I actually knew them. As other reviewers have mentioned, Laura is a bit weak. It's a little hard to reconcile how agonizingly hard Marian and Walter work on Laura's behalf when most of the time Laura seems to be sobbing, near-fainting, clutching Marian's hands, etc... To be fair, there are key instances in the plot when Laura does show some backbone. But I suppose such is the nature of love. Marian and Walter truly love Laura and will do anything to help her. The plot keeps you guessing until the very end, so hang in there! It will take awhile but definitely a worth-while read."
5,Astonishingly Fun Read,"I had a favorite college professor named Harry R. Sullivan, and this was his favorite book. However I never took ""Victorian Prose"" under him, because his class on Trolloppe and Thackeray almost killed me. 30 years later, I attempted to read it, and the old boy was right. It is well-crafted and fast paced..for Victorian prose... I found myself carrying it around to get to the next chapter. A great mystery piece. I am a fan. Here's to you, Dr. Sullivan!"
5,Just fantastic!,"Let me say this -- I LOVED this book. I devoured it over a couple of days and have reread pages and passages since. I don't often choose to read victorian gothic, but the characters and the plot devices really hooked me. Setting: England, circa 1800s. Lush countryside estates. Characters: Two half sisters, bound through maternal line -- one rich, one poor -- one pretty, one not so much -- one very clever, the other, well is a tool to be abused. And get this -- an obese count to play the part of villain along with a dastardly baronet to wed an orphan girl.....you'll love it. And also -- get the Andrew Lloyd Webber CD of the musical with the same name AND watch the masterpiece theater version as well. Three ways to enjoy this splendid tale. I would rate it higher than 5 stars if I could!"
3,Interesting but long-winded,"I read The Woman in White on a very good recommendation, and I was disappointed. Although the basic storyline is interesting it is waaaay too long. It takes a long time for the ""mystery"" itself to develop and the progression is slow. I realize that the book is a product of its time but if you are looking for a thrilling old-timey mystery this is not it."
4,Great stuff...,"Great book, very mysterious and somewhat surreal. It's extremely captivating and enticing to read."
5,A fantastic book of mystery and detection,"One of the first Victorian sensation novels where Collins inspires a creepy effect for his unexpecting readers. Unsolved mysteries at the end of every chapter often shock and trouble you immensely. Prepare to be stunned by Collins' slight comedy in the character of 'Mr Frederick Fairlie' and the unfailing strength of Laura and Marian. Full of mystery and suspense that induces a rollercoaster drop effect in your stomach at success, or makes you cold as never ending obstacles are layed in the struggle for happiness. A must for any reader!"
2,Written in OLD English!,"It became very boring! The story is told by several different people, making it alot to keep up with! I finally just quit reading,which is something I have really never done before!"
5,The Woman in White,"Loved this book. Read it on my Kindle for book club, our annual ""classic"". Appreciate the strong sense of the period in which it is set, the emotions of the characters, the mystery. A very long book that sucked me in so that I had a hard time putting it down to get on with my day."
5,Totally gripping,"I have read this book several times and just reread it after many years. I don't understand those who think it hard to follow. If one pays attention the plot is easily understood. Too many people are used to being spoonfed and have trouble with Dickens and Collins because they demand attention.This book is frightening and not in any supernatural way but because I wondered what I would do if I had been Laura or Anne, shut away in an asylum against my will. what would I do if I were trapped and unable to reach anyone to help me? It's this helplessness that is so frightening and the inability for the law to do anything without proof.I highly recommend this book. And Marian Halcamb is a true heroine in a Victorian era, fighting back at injustice. These are characters you won't soon forget although Laura is very much in the Dickens mode: pretty, complaisant, mostly, and depending on others. A woman of her times."
5,"A wonderful, intriguing novel that is frequently overlooked","The Woman in White is a classic, perhaps overlooked novel of the Victorian era. It is perhaps the first, and still one of the very few novels to have a lead female character who is (gasp) ugly! Her introduction to the novel is priceless, and is one of my favorite character intro's of all time. This is a tale of suspense and intrigue, as Marian Halcombe tries to save her sister Laura from an unwanted marriage with the help of Laura's tutor and would-be suitor Walter Hartright (heart's in the right place?). Throw these three in the same house with Laura's villainous, deceitful husband Sir Percival Glyde, add in the evil Count Fosco plus a mysterious woman who looks an awful lot like Laura, and you have a tense, intriguing, complex novel. I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and think that if you give it a chance, you will too."
5,Woman in White/Wilkie Collins... loved it.,"Wilkie Collins' writing is amazing. The story is so engaging, spoken from such different points of view with unique voices. To think it was written in the late 1800's and so enjoyable today. He is a master story teller. A classic read that HS English classes should embrace."
5,One of the world's true classics,"""The Woman in White"" is one of the best books I have ever read. It's a mystery, and I was on the edge of my seat until the surprising ending. The story is about two sisters, and a mysterious woman in white. After one of the sister's is married, their entire world is turned upside down. Madness, and murder soon follow the ill fated sisters. Told from several different views this book will easily become one of your favorite books."
3,the visitor by Pamela Morrey,"amanda and david trenby and their 3 children have recently moved into an old victorian cottage in the village of Oakley,near Oxford.David had recently switched jobs to a solicitors in Oxford this being the reason for their move.One day after everyone had left for work and school Amanda was left to unpack the few remaining boxes,but her thoughts were soon interrupted by a knock at the front door.Standing at the door was a young lady in old-fashioned attire,without a second thought she was invited in and made to feel at home.After a short while the visitor left the cottage thanking Amanda for her hospitallity.A few weeks after the visit David and Amanda were busy storing unused items in their attic when they came across an old chest containing a photo album and a diary.Will these items unlock the past history of the cottage and give an identity to the strange visitor? Only time will tell.........."
3,The Ghost of Thomas Kempe,"THE GHOST OF THOMAS KEMPE IS ABOUT A BOY NAMED JAMES WHO GETS SPOOKED OUT BY STRANGE LETTERS AND NOISES THAT FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE GOES. JAMES'S PARENTS PUNISH HIM AND MAKE HIM TIDY THE NOTES UP, BUT TELLING THEM IT WAS'T HIM JUST MAKES MATTERS WORSE. AS ALL OF THIS IS SCARING HIM HE INVITES HIS FRIEND AROUND FOR A SLEEP OVER TO PROVE IT IS NOT HIM MAKING THE MESS. WHEN JAMES'S FRIEND SEES THE NOTES APPEARING IN THIN AIR HE CANNOT BELIEVE HIS EYES. THE GHOST OF THOMAS KEMPE WAS WRITTEN BY PENELOPE LIVELY BY JOHN DAVIES"
3,what books are the above reviews for???,You have 50 reviews for this book (the woman in white) which total 4 1/2 stars out of 5 - enough to really pique my curiosity. But I quickly realized most of the reviews seem to be for other books (there's one for a Steven King book for example). I was really interested in buying this book until I realized that most of the reviews are for other books.
4,For Wilkie Collins fans:,Its a good read for mystery book readers. It also has romance with plenty of suspense. I've watched the b&w movie but some important things were left out which made the book even better.
5,The Woman in White,"Part of the genre of Sensation Novels which emerged in the mid Victorian era, Wilkie Colins's work The Woman in White is a page-turner full of gothic elements mixed with Victorian Realism. The book is written in a way similar to the Epistolary style. If you're looking for a read reminiscent of Radcliffe, or just a book to make you gasp aloud, this is a good choice. The Villains are villainous, the heroes are heroic, the ladies in distress are distressed... While quite a little monster in the realm of page count (over 600), I had no problems with ""slow spots"" or dragging points in the story. If there isn't nail-biting ""whodunnit"", then there is intriguing interaction between characters which never seemed forced or fake. Definitely a good read."
3,long-winded per the times,"I purchased the Kindle version of this book because of so many positive reviews. The plot and characters are intriguing, but it took me a month to get through it. As with many books of the time, the narration is long and drawn out. Thought processes are explained in too much detail.The dialogue is good, even great at times. One of my favorite lines comes from an antagonist: ""I am thinking,"" he said, ""whether I shall add to the disorder in this room, by scattering your brains about the fireplace."" During scenes like this one, I'm glad to have read it. But at other times, after pages of ""thought explanation"", I was happy to be done with it.I did appreciate some of the characters and narratives from varying viewpoints (along with bits of humor), but I don't recommend this to someone who is not a fan of Victorian literature."
5,the best mystery ever written,"Collins is really the forerunner of the whole genre of detective fiction and this is his finest book. I also loved the Moonstone, but this is clearly his most perfect work. I challenge anyone to start reading and then to try to put this book down before you are through (and since it's quite long, it's not easy). Once you've read all of Agatha Cristie's books, you can see how she must have read Collins to structure her books and plots. Unlike many new detective novels, you also get the benefit of great Victorian writing. Think of it as killing two birds with one stone: reading a Jane Austen book with a gripping mystery plot! Do NOT opt for the abridged version -- it would be a shame to miss even one word of Collins' original text."
5,Entebbe Rescue,I enjoyed reading about this historic event that happened in 1976. The book is very well written and there is no problem finishing it on one sitting. If you would like info on the history of Israel's Dealings with the Arab World and Various Terrorist Organizations there is quite a detailed history listed here as well as the amazing rescue at the Entebbe Airport in Uganda.Gerald Vaughan-Irving
3,Operation THUNDERBOLT,"I read the previous reviews before purchasing this book and the book sounded outstanding as it was written by an Israeli in 1976. One thing turned me off before I even started to read this book though. On the back cover, the Preface and throughout the book, the rescue is referred to as ""Operation Thunderball"", vice the correct codename, ""Operation Thunderbolt""; which was changed to ""Operation Yonatan"" after the raid in honor of LtCol Netanyahu. Such a glaring error on the outside cover and throughout the book reflects poor editing or translating by the publisher. Perhaps the publisher was thinking of the James Bond thriller, Thunderball. Overall, a great paperback book."
5,A big hit with our twins!,"$40 may sound like a lot for a foam floor puzzle, but our 2.5yr-old boys got this for Christmas and its become their favorite toy. One boy already knows his states better than his mom, ""No mama, New Jersey goes right here!"" Unlike most other floor puzzles, each piece is shaped like a state, instead of the ubiquitous ""puzzle"" shape. There are also some inset shapes within a state, our favorite is the ""arch"" in Missouri. In my opinion, these more varied shapes allow for fun learning, whereas the common ""puzzle"" shapes are more of a trial and error exercise.Unfortunately, the ink labelling each state has started to rub off. I can't tell the Great Lakes apart anymore, not that I really could before. But, we called the company and they have offered to ship us a whole new replacement puzzle. That's pretty impressive.We're starting to look around for more puzzles like this. I'd love to find one of the world or even just other countries. A great idea and a great buy."
1,OMG this is NOT a puzzle,"TWICE I have ordered this to recieved NOTHING BUT SMALL FOAM STRIPS. I am literally in tears at the moment with heart break for my 3 yr old who i kept telling the puzzle was coming and she was very excited, and out of frustration. I have had it, and are now looking for somewhere else to buy this."
4,A Great Christmas Carol- For the KIDS,"This Christmas Carol knows how to please its audience, which are mostly kids. It also knows how to fill a giant stage with spectacular production numbers. Dickens may turn over in his grave as his story is sweetened and shortened. But he's used to that after ""Oliver"". I'll stop being a Scrooge and admit that it is joyous with an excellent score by Menken and Ahrens."
5,An adaptation that soars like the original,"Mr. Scrooge and his three Christmas spirits are icons of popular culture, for everyone knows the story of ""A Christmas Carol."" In this wonderful musical, however, the story is retold and reimagined through an hour and a half of enjoyable music. I stumbled upon this CD accidentally in my local library, and it was a hunt to find it after that. Telling the majority of the story through song, the CD captures the essence and spirit of Dickens's classic, while introducing modern and original touches as well. The cast is wonderful, and they have a strong vocal sound. I certainly recommend this CD to anyone."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't waste your time with this book. There is very little insight provided. Rather, the author spends the majority of his time either a) ranting about the outdoor advertising agency, or b) trying to sell his book to a broader audience."
3,It's god to look beautiful pictures but nothing else.,In book are manny colour pictures but low qwality information. I don't recomend to bay this book.
4,this is a cool band,this cd is realy cool.the dude's vocals are great.they have some pure christian lyrics and the guitar playing is wicked cool.
1,Time to What??,"I cannot believe this group can call themselves Christians and sing the glory of suicide. How many times is God or Christ mentioned? It almost seemed to me to be satan's tool instead of God's. I work in a Christian book store, and I'm taking it off my shelf!!"
2,Great for one season,"First, this system worked as advertised. I have no complaints. The first year I had nice lettuce, bok choy and spinach.Now for year two: I recognize that I live in the desert and that things don't last forever, but for a system that was protected in a greenhouse, it didn't last more than one year. The plastic ""gasket"" around the water inlet is totally disintegrated and totally useless. The Unit itself is very brittle and has 4 or 5 cracks in it. Those cracks won't matter if I can't figure out a replacement for the gasket because the top won't flood and it will be headed for the trash.Seriously, go Google up PVC hydroponic systems and build your own. You can buy all the parts from the local hardware store and scale it to suit your needs. Plus with a coat of Krylon, the PVC will be protected from the sun and last for years."
4,So Far So Good,"I asked for Emily's garden for my birthday. I thot I would like to have fresh herbs for cooking and 6 would be enough. My kids bought me the Mega Garden (15 pots). I am so glad - I am growing dill, 2 cilantro, parsley, 3 lettuce, oregano, basil and 1 tomato plant. They have grown so large that I really can't imagine having all 15 planted. It has been fun watching it all grow - not as much work as I thot it would be. Fun to show my grandkids and friends. My son did set the system up as I did think the directions were somewhat unclear."
2,Only the containers are useful.,"Thankfully, I bought this AFTER I had taken the plunge and made my own ebb and flood system from a Rubbermaid bucket and parts purchased here and there. I bought this because I wanted another system but didn't want to bother building it myself. Foolish optimist! The pump was so weak the table never flooded, so I replaced that. The water outtake valve was too short, so I had to replace that. Since I was overhauling the thing anyway, I also added an air pump and air stone to keep the water oxygenated.I didn't use the square black plastic buckets. Instead, I laid down a bed of Sure to Grow and covered it with black plastic mulch. I grew radishes."
1,Awful Recording!,"Since there were no comments on Amazon I unfortunately found a wrongly favorable review on an audiophile discs website. After listening to this I surprisingly found it to be a murky recording with no detail. So frustrated, I retrieved from my throwaway bin my 18 year old Levine conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra CD previously thinking this SACD would blow it away. Boy, was I wrong: My 18 year old CD stomps this SACD badly with a much better recording and even much better playing (see my review). So don't waste your time with this disappointing SACD and get the much superior Levine/Chicago Symphony Orchestra CD on Deutsche Grammophon label."
1,Mediocre,"Though the book is essential in examining ""the assassins"" and their history it makes the error of referring to this sect as radical and reflects old ideas. Recent studies such as Farhad Daftary's Assassin Legends contribute more to dispelling the inaccurate myths concerning this group."
2,Not a scholarly book: cut and paste brief history,"This is not a bad book, but it is too short, fragmented, with few footnotes, and seems like a collection of thoughts more than a 'scholarly' book.Keeping that in mind, it gets 2 stars. You can also surf the web and get the same information."
4,Informative,"A good solid narrative of the history of the Assassins, giving answers to those of us with a curiousity about this mysterious sect. Overall a brief, enjoyable and concise work."
3,Scholarly accout of the Assassins,"If you are buying this book to find out some of the gory exploits of the Assassins, as I was, you will probably be disappointed.By drawing on many accounts of this enigmatic group, he tries to set the record straight about the origins, developments, and eventual failure of this sect of Islam. If you are like me and have no background in medieval Islamic history, you will be inundated with names and places that are unfamiliar and hard to pronounce. The layman will therefore find the going slow. One will discover that slaughtering one's own religious brethern is far from an excluively Christian phenomenon.If you want an academic analysis of the Ismaili sect of Islam and its offshoot that became the Assassins, this is the book for you. If you are looking for something a little more sensational, you might be disappointed with this book."
5,Great Mother's Day Gift,I purchased this pendant for my wife as a Mother's Day gift and she absolutely loves it. She wears it daily and gets many comments about it. The price was fantastic and it was shipped right on time.
1,Only 2 children and small,"Ridiculous. I ordered this necklace and got the mother+ 2 children instead. What a fantastic mother's day gift...Also, microscopic. Picture needs quarter next to it so we can see the scale."
4,This was smaller than expected,This was smaller than expected but very nice. We don't have 4 children so I told my wife I was the largest child - the 5 of us. She wears it all the time so I think she likes it too.
5,Wonderful Mother's Day Gift!,I just bought this for my mother as a Mother's day gift. She loved it! I am on a limited budget as a college student so- the price for such a beautiful piece was amazing!
4,mother and four children necklace,my mom loves it but the chain is too short. So now I have to take her to jewlery store to find the right size chain.
3,Below expectations,"In an attempt to replace a double boiler we have had for years, I purchased the MIU stainless 2 quart. I was very disapointed that the insert pan was very light weight. It will not even sit on it's base without tipping over due to the weight of the handle. Using the pan alone without a water bath would be impossible."
5,double boiler,This is a wonderful product! Very well made and will probably last a life time! I love it
1,Very disappointing,This DVD has however many minutes of Rick sitting in front of a fireplace telling us an exhaustive list of events that happened throughout history at the time of the Pluto/Jupiter conjunct/opposition and the Pluto/Uranus conjunct/opposition. The same cartoon of Pluto and Jupiter spins around over and over and over again when we are not looking at Rick in front of the fireplace. The only decent aspect of the DVD was a beautiful but repetitive graphic image of the planets orbiting the sun. This is not an instructive astrology DVD - it is an advertorial about how astrology is useful in predicting world events.
3,Very average. . .,"There's nothing really in this record that sets it apart from any other, its alot along the same lines as Blu Cantrell, (although Blu sings a little better)Faith Evans, (although Faith sings better)Monifah (although Monifah sings better) and a lot of the other stuff out right now. I do give Sharissa credit for making a song like Put Down That Phone though, its a very romantic song, that I'll probably listen to with my girlfriend several times. Other than that though, No Half Steppin' is just such an average body of work, the same tired topics (mistreating and cheating boyfriends, people in your business, and that bad guy that you just can't let go of for some reason). Overall, give Sharissa props for making it as far as she has and for making a couple of good songs on her debut, but that's pretty much it, if I could go back to a few hours ago when I bought this, I'd probably pass, of course thats just my opinion though."
3,It's All Right!,I think Sharissa is going to be really successful in the future. She has good slow songs. It's an okay freshman CD!
1,No Talent - Self Promoting Nothin,She's got a lot of nerve - and that's about it....the bizatch can't sing!
2,Could Be Better,"I saw this online and figured it would be perfect for my dad's ""man cave"". Although I was pretty disappointed when it arrived and was just a little bigger than a standard notebook and extremely flimsy. It's still a neat little thing to have, but don't expect too much."
3,Bar code sticker,Purchased this as a gift...can't give it as this item has a bar code sticker smackon front of sign. Even if sticker can be removed an image will appear where stickerhad been. Is there a reason why the sticker could not have been on the BACK???? Howdumb!!! Disappointed. Will have to return.
2,i didnt expect it to be so small.,When I bought this sign I thought it would be about twenty inches or so in width. It isn't. It is only about 14 inches. Made kind of cheaply. But it didn't cost very much so I am happy with what I got for what I paid
5,Perfect,I bought this for my bf and he loves it! we put it on the door of his bedroom and it looks great!
3,Great looking but a little flimsy,"The price was good and it is a good size, but it is made of a flimsy plastic. Wish it were thicker and more sturdy. Still awesome though!"
2,Deprived and confused,"Steven-Elliot Altman can never decide what direction the book should go. So we get sci-fi, social statements, intrigue, and on and on and repeat. I started the book and thought, oh, so cool, but that was replaced as I continued with oh, here we go. Way too confusing. The authur can write but the message in this one isn't consistant."
2,Extremely disappointed....,"The back cover of this DVD looks as if it was made in 2006, however it contains very, very old fuzzy and blurry sub-standard footage and less than audible audio quality. Although it covers a wide range of topics, it merely skims over most and really shows nothing new. The ancient footage of Jack Palance and Samantha Eggar, and the Reverend Jim Jones (of the Jonestown massacre) give an idea of how ancient the content of this DVD is. Very disappointing."
1,Half Empty,"The taste is okay. It's very sweet, but the canisters are all half empty. No way will I buy this again."
2,Tea drinker,I bought this tea because of a review I read. I do not like the taste of this tea. You get a lot more of this than the caramel apple cider which is excellent. I will not buy this again.
4,Great Introduction to the Rainforest,"This video is a great introduction to the ecology of the rainforest. The soundtrack is good (although nap-inspiring in some places). The camera work is top notch (it is National Geographic after all). The narration is engaging, but a little over-dramatic in places. The only gripe I have is the ""save the rainforest"" bit at the end of the tape. It is as annoying as it is unnecessary. Most people I know could live without more eco-preaching."
1,PULEASE! YUCK!,"As being one of the subjects of a story Mr. Taylor has written. I can assure you that the only research I've seen is what he took from newspapers..not from the actual participants of the incident. It makes one wonder what else he 'borrowed' from newspapers, magazines to 'research' the stories for his books."
5,Nothing beats OEM inks!,"The Pixma 9500 printer offers the best image quality one can receive in a mostly affordable printer, even better than the corner photo lab (because you can tweak the colors yourself!) These inks manufactured by Canon offer the best image quality one can expect from the printer, with no hassles. The few times I bother with third party ink, I was always disappointing with the color quality, so if you care at all about color reproduction, I highly recommend these Canon OEM inks, you wont be disappointing."
5,Nothing replaces the original!,I got a 10 pack of generic ink cartridges and none of them worked properly there was a print that only used 4 different inks or I couldn't get anything to work so I got a different brand they had most of the same problems incorrect ink levels some the printer couldn't find them so after 3 tries with generics I am sticking with canon it cost a little more but you know it will work every time and you don't have rainbow color fingers.
5,Very Nice Printer Ink,"The Canon PGI-9 inks are very good, since getting myCanon PIXMA MX7600 Office All-in-One Printerwhich takes these ink tanks my picture prints have never looked better. If you are considering a printer which uses these inks you won't be disappointed by the quality of the print.I am a slightly bothered by the fact that you can not get them at your local office supply store, but that's what Amazon.com is here for. At least you can recycle them at local office supply stores."
2,Insanely Expensive Printing Solution,"The Canon Pro9500 Mark II is by far one of the best printers on the market for photos. The large format and 10 tanks will produce just about anything you can imagine. But that is where it ends. Canon should put on every description that this printer is not for everyday use. It does not print regular text well, or rather, it's so insanely expensive to print, you won't want to. And extremely slow. When one ink tank goes out, by the time it goes through the process, it's drained at least 2 more. One Set of ink is right at $125. That's just plain insulting.Oh, and no where does it say it's limited to regular paper only, in other words, it won't even print an envelope and there is nothing in the print driver system to let it. That is terrible. But as in the beginning, it's one of the best photo printers out there. And 13X19 is awesome, just hold on to your pocketbook. FlamethrowerOne.com"
1,I didn't get to use it.,"I bought this ink and the Canon PGI-9 photo magenta as well, I sent it back because I had ordered the wrong items. I wanted PGI-9 M. I had opened both of them and placed them into my printer before I realized my mistake. Amazon said they would review my return items, and I would know whether or not they accepted it within two weeks, That was about three weeks ago, and no info back yet."
3,Canon Ink Sorta-Value Pack,"I've purchased two of these. While the per-tank cost is lower that buying individually, it doesn't make the tanks last any longer - my Canon 9500 drinks these things like water.Also, in both orders, many of the tanks in the box have not been wrapped in the individual factory plastic bags. Normally the stuff doesn't get a chance to sit around in my office and dry out (see above), but I certainly can see where that could be a problem."
3,It's Ink!,Hey lest face it all the big printer companies have monopoly on their ink. We are forced to comply in order to continue living our lives in harmony and undisrupted co-inhabitance with the world. Unfortunately the generic mock ups of these ink tanks don't cut the mustard and smear and smudge.Product Quality is great but the price isn't!
1,Order with caution! Product is not what is described or pictured.,"As stated by the previous comments, apparently what they ship is the incorrect cartridge of PGI-9PM. It appears lighter pink on the box and is made for Canon PIXMA Pro9500 Photo Printer, not the MX7600. A bit inconvenient to not be able to print still, but Amazon did say they would research this and they promptly issued me a credit for the return."
2,"If you can avoid photo printers, avoid them","Although this pack is the best you can buy if you want to save money, one realizes early on that companies producing photo printers are making too much money on the printer ink: they have to bring down the prices eventually."
1,Wait to see if your printer is reliable before purchasing.,"15 month old Pixma Pro 9500 Mark II, all new cartridges at over $100, needs repair or replacement with unknown problem and NO help from Canon."
4,Canon ink tank,This product was shipped fast and worked wonderfully. I will continue to use Amaozon for all of my ink tank needs.
4,5 Stars if not so pricey ( DUH ! )2,"If you have a Pixma Pro 9500 AND print black and whites you are gonna wanna buy extra of these(as I found out !)!Yeah, it's great to get the hundred plus $ pack of all the inks BUT unless you are printing completely balanced color photos you will soon find out you need different inks per job !As of the ink quality... I know no others.Thanks,Mako."
4,5 Stars if not so pricey ( DUH ! ),"As the quality of the ink....I know of nothing better !!!!It is eggspensive (see what I did there? Yellow ink,Egg,get it?) !Sorry, anyhoozles yes I would giver a 5 star if they weren't so dang costly !I use cheapo ink on my old printers and a zombie printer (It sat for over five years uncovered and I resurrected it) with mixed results and LOTS of ""hey you are using the wrong ink"" garb from the printers !With my Pixma Pro 9500 I am unwilling to try ANYTHING but Canon inks. That's just me as the prints with their ink is outstanding !Thanks, Mako"
1,Bad Choice,It arrived in a Gatorade Btl package !!!!Was not even in the canon packaging. This is ridicules. Buy it from someone who actually has the item to sell...
4,A good country Christmas album,"The title song to this album deserves to become more well known, as it is truly catchy and fun. Joe has a great voice and does the classic Christmas songs justice. The only reason I give this album 4 stars and not 5, is because I like the Clint Black Christmas album better, so I could not rate this the same, but it is a very good album nonetheless, and worth owning a copy of. The kiddies in particular will enjoy the fun ""Leroy the redneck Reindeer"". In fact, there's something on here for everyone, and a 'must' to play on Christmas Day."
4,Underated Album,"This is a much underrated album. It was realised in 1975 but, at the time was a commercial flop.Two tracks stand out ""YOU"" and ""Walk Softly"" - well written and arranged. Both songs can be found on You Tube.As far as I know this album has never been released on CD, and in my opinion should be remastered and reissued."
2,Functional but klunky on Kindle,"This is a review ofMacMay's version of the Book of Mormon (Kindle edition).This appears to be the standard contemporary version of the text, but is missing the LDS chapter summaries. Also it does *not* have a table of contents and is thus difficult to navigate. For starting at the beginning and reading straight through, it will suffice. But for going to any specific book or chapter, there is no easy way to do so except for text searching. Regarding the formatting, each sentence has a title. ie, a sentence will start:1 Nephi 2:2020 (a single sentence)1 Nephi 2:2121 (a single sentence)complete with 2 or three lines of white space between each sentence. This makes the text look awkward and interrupts the flow, but it does give the user something to search on when navigating.Recommended only for the price; if ease-of-use and/or readability is more important to you, I suggest getting a different version."
1,"Read, prayed and got a stupor of thought","It's said that if the Book of Mormon is true, all other religions are not. What if it is false? Smith said he translated the plates which were written in Reformed Egytpian. He also claimed he translated Regular Egyptian in the Book of Abraham. Egyptologists have looked at Smith's translation of facsimiles and papyri and determined he could not translate Egyptian in the least. He had lied. I read the Book of Mormon and got a bad feeling about it. Learning that he lied about translating Egyptian, I don't believe the Book of Mormon is true in the least."
5,Always inspires and uplifts me,"I always find inspiration and insight in reading the Book of Mormon. It is of tremendous value to me. The Book of Mormon, along with the Bible, helps me to know Jesus Christ, and to feel his love in my life. This book contains a unique promise, which is that after reading and pondering the Book of Mormon, you can ""ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."" I have done this, and have received a clear and unmistakable answer that the Book of Mormon is indeed from God. I am grateful to have the Book of Mormon, along with the Bible, to inspire me and to teach me."
1,they were brain washed by communist,"these 2 people were completely brain washed by communist.pity them. I thought it was funny, if they thought communist was so good why did they even bother to come back to the states?"
4,Why does this book always seem to get bad reviews elsewhere?,"I really like this book. I was forced to buy this in my very first Introduction to Visual Basic programming. My best advice for people interested in buying this book is make sure you are an absolute beginner to VB programming. Anyone with previous experience will find this book extremely dry. Even after developing Visual Basic for a year and a half, I still use this book as a reference when I'm reverting back to some of the basics of VB programming. Every possible beginning VB topic is covered, from Input Boxes to Message Boxes, If..Then..Else cases to Select cases. Enjoy."
3,They Hadn't Quite Figured Out How to Record Loud Bands Yet,"Yes, I know everyone's going to hate me for saying this, and I'm a huge fan of both Tom Dowd (the producer) and Cream, but this album stands as a monument to just how bad even a big budget live recording could be in this era. I had the album, I bought the CD, I bought the re-mastered CD -- and they're all terrible. I just shake my head every time I listen to the more or less contemporaneous Ten Years After Live at the Fillmore released a couple of years ago (produced by Eddie Kramer) -- that one sounds great, just like a live show at the Fillmore actually sounded. This one sounds horrible. Needles in the ear drums.So we have the live show of a bunch of enjoyable journeymen recorded with great fidelity, and this musical work of genius is almost unlistenable -- there were better live recordings made in the 30s. Life is a funny old duck."
2,Incredibly inconsistent,"This album combines really fine performances with some of the most unlistenable stuff ever committed to vinyl. Come on, even you fans must admit that you skip over some of the Jack Bruce filler here. When they stick to the blues here they are great, but otherwise....this should have been a one record set when released. It is unfair to the novice who might read these reviews to pretend that this is some sort of tremendous masterpiece from start to finish."
1,Poor audio quality,"We just upgraded our stereo system with Vienna speakers and a Marantz integrated amplifier. Music comes alive! So we were excited to get this CD, which we expected to contain amazing instrumental sections. The recording quality was so poor that after listening to it once, we took it out of our CD changer and returned it."
4,Those Were The Days (Yes They Were),"I remember when this one came out. A two record set. Wow! Unheard of at the time. The funny thing is it would almost fit on one CD today.I'm not a fan of the live stuff here. Drum solos aren't my thing, and 20 minutes of ""Spoonful"" is about 14 minutes too long. The studio cuts are top notch and remain ahead of their time. ""Passing The Time"" sounds like it could have been recorded in the 1700's. ""White Room"" remains an all time classic, but what does it really mean?All in all, an ambitious album filled with great songs."
5,Wheels of Fire,"I first bought Wheels of Fire when I was a teenager (in vinyl,of course, 8 track tape was available, and than cassette tapes became available). I'm guessing that it was first released in 1968. I played it so often I wore it out, so I had to buy a second copy. Wheels of Fire has a nice collection of music, Crossroads is full of hot guitar runs, and this song is still played on the radio today 40 years later. Classic. Crank it up. The other live tracks, Spoonful, Traintime and Toad, give all three members of the group (Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Eric Clapton) a chance to show off. White Room is perhaps the most frequently played, but I think it is one of the lesser songs on the album, I prefer Sitting On Top Of The World, Politician, Born Under A Bad Sign. If you like classic rock, Wheels Of Fire is a timeless piece of history.Jeff Winholt"
5,CREAM,I PICKED THIS RATING BECUSE I LIKE THIS BAND ITS OLD AND I GREW UP LISTENING TO THESE GUYS PLAY...A GREAT OLD BAND.......
5,One of the best Ranma 1/2 videos i've ever seen!,"I definitely recommend this to everybody especially you anime fans! This is so funny! The first episode is about a phoenix egg Kuno bought. But after it accidentally hatches, the trouble begins! The second episode has Shampoo and Ukyo plotting to break Ranma and Akane up in the ""Tunnel of Lost Love,"" which ends up in hilarious results. The story is pretty complex especially in the second episode so some people might get confused, but it's all good."
4,"Hillarious, probably the funniest Ranma that I've seen.","The first episode is absolutely hillarious. Well worth the buy, even in light of the rather bland second episdode."
5,Maybe I believe after all.,The second episode on this tape is pretty goood. the only bad thing I have to say about it is that it shares the same tape as the first episode. The first episode on the tape made me laugh so hard I started crying. This episode is worth the price of the tape alone. Brief nudity but no real questionable content. After both episodes are over there are several music videos at the end of the tape. Very cool.
1,"Good idea - just not ready for ""prime time""","This is a frustrating gadget that should work and ALMOST does. How difficult can it be to put essential oils on a paper mat and stick it in the diffuser unit? But if you're seeking a refreshing boost after slaving over a hot computer all day, you'll have to wait for the unit to warm up... and add more oil to the pad to refresh it! There is not enough heat or capacity to last through one trip, let alone a full day.Bottom line: Save your money. Put the oil on a stack of cotton pads and tuck it on the dashboard. Poof! Instant aromatherapy. Summer heat will warm the oils and your A/C will distribute the fragrance; in winter, the defroster and heater will perform that service. If you worry about staining, put the pads in a cheap plastic box or recycle a jar lid."
4,Better Than Playmakers,"When HBO started to do TV series, One of the first was First and Ten. This 13 episode first season is cute and showcases a woman owner who gets the team in a divorce settlemet. Soapy, Sitcomy and cutey series was great for the late 80's, but seems dated today.The bigest drawback on this DVD is the canned laughter misplaced in this sitcomy show. Also, with lines like ""They aint human, they are football players!"" , be glad a very young but seasoned Delta Burke and Reid Shelton lead this ensemble cast.This DVD is better than that gritty ESPN show Playmakers. One can hope there is a BOX set of all the episodes from all the six seasons soonBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
5,good,Item arrived as described and quickly.I was very pleased with my purchase and how fast I got the item. Will definitely do business again. Thank you
5,Excellent!,The book was in great condition just as advertised and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner!
2,Toxic is right...,"Maybe in fairness I should disclaim I watched Happy Birthday Harris Malden the same night as this (both Cinetic films) - which makes this fellow indie feel like it sucks the life out of what time you have to watch films.This irritating hand held mess follows several lady ""friends"" as they eat, go to the bathroom with sunglasses on, walk, argue, drive, camp and pretty much bore the heck out of you. This got all kinds of wonderful reviews out of a film festival or two for those that enjoy this style of shaky-cam film making and improv, but it is not worth the price to get on demand.There are no menus, sound options or immediate eject options once this spirals into full irritation level; proceed at your risk with the knowledge of the style and content, skipper."
3,return policy,"Unfortunately, in my effort to to get my Christmas shopping done early, I ordered this item in November. My son did not like his watch, and I need to send it back. When I looked on the invoice, I noticed they charge a 15% restocking fee for items returned after 30 days. I feel this is an unfair practice, as I already have to pay to have the item shipped back."
1,Product has expired,"I ordered a full year's supply to save money on shipping. 85% of the product received has expired (3 months after expiration date). Since the seller was out of stock, they gave me full refund. The refund was processed promtly."
1,Poor product,This grill is pretty expensive. I expected more than I got.I've used this grill +/- 20 times.- It does not get hot enough not does it retain heat as well as it should.- It is difficult to get lit.- It is MESSY. Being able to snuff out the charcoal and use it again sounds great until you look at your handsafter you rearange the coals to light them on the next use...YUK- I used the snuff out bag. After a couple of hours I put the grill away in a compartment in my motorhome. Wewere aroused at around 2 AM by the CO detector. The grill was still hot and burning!!!!! Lucky thats all thathappened!!!My advice is stay away!
5,Hibachi,We had a very similar hibachi as a kid growing up and taking it everywhere. I was at the folks place last year and I saw it sitting there. That hibachi has got to be 35 or more years old. The storage bag seems like it might be hard to put on the hibachi when it is still hot. I will use this hibachi alot.
2,"Great concept, poor execution","Cool idea, and extremely tempting for RV's, park trips.However, it just doesn't heat up. I tried burgers and chicken. I had to be patient, and I was cooking for myself. Forget filling the grill surfaces with food. I had filled it with charcoal, but it just doesn't hold much, and it is a thin layer, so low heat. There are better options out there for portable grills. Keep looking."
2,Son of a ?,After studying the available on-line hibatchi's I purchased the Son Of Hibatchi. The only favorable thing I have found about it is it's portability. It does not light as advertised or shown on several You Tube videos. For a simple hibatchi it is very difficult to use. I have been using charcoal grills for years and would not buy this one again.
3,It' okay but no cigar,"The Hibachi works okay for cooking small, quick items like hamburgers or hotdogs. When I attempted to fold it up and place it into the snuff out pouch, all the coals fell to the center and it would not close. Great idea in theory but not in practice."
5,I am a lifelong fan,"I remember my dad having similar grill back in early 80's when I was just a kid. I don't know what happened to our grill, but when I grew up it was already gone and I couldn't find another one to buy anywhere.Then my average Weber grill got stolen and I went online to buy another grill. So finally, 20 years later I found this grill I was looking for! to my great surprise it was the same high quality grill I remembered! the only difference is our old grill had wooden handles.this is high quality cast iron grill and it works as advertised!highly recommended!"
3,Facts or sour grapes?????,"I read it because I'm a curious fan. As a fan of the group I was disapointed...I can't tell if any of the ""facts"" in this book are fact or the product of a disgruntled former associate trying to cash in on an aquaintance. This book focused on Ace Frehley and his adventures. It did not paint a very flattering picture of Ace or the the Rest of Kiss. Was any of it TRUE??? From the author's tone, I'll take the whole thing with a helping of salt...as for the second book???? I have'nt read it but why bother? I've had enough salt already."
4,Don't read this book if you worship Ace,"This book totally shattered my image of Ace Frehley in a single afternoon. I bought this book at 3pm and was so engrossed with it that I could not put it down, I finished the book around 9pm. Great book if you hate Ace. I don't. Or at least I didn't, or hell, I don't know. This book just really put my brain in a tailspin and I'm not sure if I can hold Ace in the same regards ever again."
1,Scum Bag GGG,"This Gordon guy is a scum bag. I heard in the 90's he had a falling out with Ace and Gordon stole money from fans while running Ace's fanclub.I wouldn't believe a thing this guy says netherless give him a penny for his national inquire type books--for his stories sound far fetched and just makes him look like the bitter, dishonest person he is......You can tell he's not very professional with all the terrible typos I've heard are in the book...."
3,Axe To Grind,A good night's read. I laughed a lot at this but wonder if it's all really true or if this guy is just another bozo trying to make money off of celebrity friends. We all know Ace is a royal screw up but the author has personal money issues with the spaceman that probably lead to his biased opinion. Check it out for the entertainment factor.
2,WOW!,"Had I known how brutal this book was, I would not have bought it! With friends like these....Ace needs NO enemy's! My question is...if Ace truly was the arrogant pig you made him out to be, why did you continue to hang with him year after year????? Also I find it very hard to believe that Ace had trouble getting women while these two supposedly had women throwing themselves at them! Seriously? I am sure Ace could be difficult from time to time....he was the lead guitarist for a huge rock band! But, the way he is portrayed in this book?????? Ace rules forever in my book!"
2,What a waste of time & money,"This is the work of a bitter man. Don't get me wrong: I wouldn't be surprised if all of what Gordon wrote was true. However, we see here a person (Gordon) who wants what Ace had (Superstardom, foolish though he was/is/whatever), and when he found himself used and abused, didn't have the guts to take a stand for himself. It sounded to me like he blamed Ace for his ended marriage, and not his own foolish choices. I can't believe I wasted my money on this."
5,Read KISS & Tell and judge for yourself,"Gordon Gebert and Bob McAdams both have written an excellent book of the amazing times they shared with the ""man"" who is Ace Frehley and KISS. KISS fans have been subjected to many opportunistic embellishments by writers who barely know Mr. Frehley and KISS, and for this reason and because of the fact that I am personal friends of both, the honest, and friendly writers, I cannot understand some of the scathing remarks made by those that have read the book but do not know any of the involved parties. I would urge KISS fans to judge for yourself. It is about time the true story was written."
2,I't's not only Ace,"People are sometimes outraged that this book makes a lot of not proven bad claims against Ace. Well, maybe they are true (what you turn Ace into s despisable, VERY despisable person), maybe they are not.But, the point is: I think it has become incresingly clear along the years that KISS was only interested in money EVER. Never cared about the fans in a real sense. Their merit was making good rock albums that had enormous influence over a lot of musicians. But the guys in Kiss... Urgh, they all su..k."
2,Character assassination from bitter hangers-ons/failed musicians.,"I read this book at the library, for there's no way I'd drop any cash for a book that is nothing more than an exercise in character assassination. These two former friends of Ace's are not only lousy writers, they are also hangers-ons who failed musicians who should be glad they got to hang with Ace for any amount of time, for that would be the biggest shot at ""celebrity"" life they'd ever get.I'll admit that some of the stories tend to be somewhat amusing. Sure, Ace has had his problems, has made his mistakes, and took part in lots of immature behavior when he was younger; but what do you expect from a rock star? In their effort to make Ace look bad, the authors end up making themselves look pretty bad, too; two grown men whining about how their celebrity friend ""mistreated"" them, and how Ace supposedly got them to do things they hated -- as if neither one of these clowns has a mind of his own."
3,"Kiss and Tell about Ace only, not other members","Although this book is titled Kiss and Tell, it is really only about Ace Frehley and not the other members of the band. The book is a compilation of stories told first hand by friends/wanna be's during different periods of Ace's career. There are a lot of detail missing about his career and rise and fall, but the stories are amusing. This is not a detailed VH1 biography or a Hammer of the Gods, but it is an amusing, short read."
2,THIS BOOK SUCKS.....,"I have read a lot of books about KISS and this one rates near the bottom. The overall quality is cheap. Looks like it was put together on a photocopier at somebody's house. Hard to take it seriously with such an amateur like quality about it. The authors just bring up dirt on Ace, without having anything positive to say about him. The dirt that they have isn't even interesting anyway. I kept thinking the book would get better as I read on. It didn't. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,Awful book,"This book is a waste of paper. The writing is bad, the editing worse, and the bitterness of two (...) trying to cash in is the worst. The book is riddled with questionable 'facts,' loaded with whining, and just not very well-written. If these clowns can write books, so can (...) chimps."
1,I won't waste my money,I have been told by very dear friends of Ace not to buy this trash book. Gordon is no longer Ace's friend since the early 90's when Gordon was running Ace's Fan Club and did some pretty shady things like steal some of Lydia Criss photo's that he now has in his book!!! Lydia did take him to court but of course possession is 9/10 of the Law so Gordon won but Ace is no longer is friend and neither is Lydia!!!The book is full of lies!!!
2,Friends or Foe?,"The one thought i had about reading this book is arethese indeed friends of Ace Frehley or enemies?As friends they sure make Ace out to be a total deadbeatperson and pig of a man. I am sure Ace had some goodpoints and positive sides to him. These so-called friendsof his only wrote about the down-side of Ace Frehley.I would of enjoyed to hear the good and the bad, notall the disgusting aspects of his life.Therefore i think the authors of this book only concentratedon the bitter bad side of Ace to make their story moreinteresting to market instead of showing an honest viewof Ace Frehley. I am sure that with the bad comes some goodin the man we know as the SpaceMan. I have faith in that."
5,I've re-read KISS & Tell countless times. I LOVE this book!,"I bought this book when it first came out years ago and it's been re-read countless times. When friends visit I pull out the book, we flip the pages, stab a chapter and read it and laugh. Each story is better than the last. I'm on my third copy as it inevitably gets ""borrowed"" and never returned! Totally recommend this book - a must read!When you do get it, hide it. You'll never get it back."
2,Save your $$ for something better,"Dude, I thought this book was going to be cool and is it not. Don't get me started about the poor quality of the editing.Come on, even tough english ain't my first language I noticed some words mispelled, unbeliavable in two grown guys.Some of the sories were fun but these two bitter men (Gordon + Bob) give authors ot there a bad name.This book is not that shocking as some people want you to believe.I read it in like one hour LOL so go figure it is not a challenge to read those tales wich are higly suspicious .Bottom line, if you are willing to read it, maybe you should try to get it second hand.Ps: Nothing written in this book changed the image I had of Ace :) but I don't worship him either."
2,"""For Inquring Minds""","I won't lie--- its' an entertainig read, but so is the National Enquirer. Basically, a one-sided smear campaign of rock guritar god, Ace Frehley, who we all know has been through the riggers of rock stardom. Probably, there is some truth in some of their stories---However, we must remind ourselves that obviously drugs, alcohol, and money were abused by not only Ace, but the authors as well; which in my view takes heavily away their credability. Obviously, they feel cheated out of money by Ace, and writing this ""stuff"" probably got them a nice pay-day. No matter what happened in those times, Frehley fans should rejoice that their hero has appearantly found his soul and to realize that he is if nothing more ---""human"" like the rest of us."
2,stiff back brace,this brace was too scratchy and stiff for me! Mybe if it had some lycra or something with a bit of give.
1,Posture Brace,"We purchased this brace and first of all, the sizing on the brace was not correct-- the size of the brace was much larger. Even if I had been a creative seamstress to make the body of the brace fit, the portion of the brace that circles the arms did nothing to support and pull back the shoulders. Of course, the product was returned. Very disappointing purchase."
1,Posture Control Brace,"Although I paid a little less then 50% of listed price, the quality was not to expections. I wasn't a good fit for me. It's difficult to know when you have never used the product if it will fit right. The size was Ok. I would have been very unhappy if I had paid the listed price."
3,LUBKA KOLESSA,"This pianist from the first half of the Twentieth century must have been marvelous. Her speed, expression and virtuosity are evident in this recording. The unfortunate thing is the sound recording does not do justice to her, and the piano at times sounds tinny. The recording is still wonderful because of its historcial significance and the opportunity to hear what a great pianist was like at the top of her craft."
5,Wonderful,I found this book very interesting and I'm sure you will also find this book as interesting as I did. Give it a try.
4,I LOVE IT,"I had purchased a cheaper headset that was highly rated and it was tinny sounding and people were alweays complaining they couldn't hear me. Finally I gave it away and bought this one. It's only ""defect"" is it doesn't come with a case or clip and has no place for a lanyard."
1,"Oh well, live and learn :(","Performs so badly, no one could ""hear me now!!"" Uncomfortable too, but I could live with that. ended up ripping the rubber out of the little hole at the bottom hoping folks could hear me but all that did was make the background noise worse. Don't waste your money."
4,Bluetooth headset,"Electronically, this device is excellent. Ergonomically, it's so-so. The on/off/hangup/etc control is difficult to locate when the device is on the ear. The button should be raised or embossed or have hair so that it could be located more easily."
2,Rap Rap Rap,You can buy it if you want to. The Beats Are BEATERS!! The lyrics are juvenile and uninspiring like everything else nowadays...No real thought here!! Download if you can...
2,They wear White tee,"They wear White tee , because they can't afford a jersey. my white tee doesn't bling. Its gets 2 out of 5."
1,That White Tee song is retarded,Im not gonna review on this.. all i can say is that if you one of them trendy thugs that wear a rainbow colored fits & clothing (gay) and dance around in the middle of the streets (like a complete moron).. then go get this album.. If your a real rap listener and knows a definition of rap & Hip Hop.. avoid this album at all costs
2,Amateur rap,"This is a dark time for rap. Any group of guys who can string enough words together to make a verse can get a record deal now. Just recently there has been an explosion of hardcore groups from the south, such as Crime Mobb, Boyz N Da Hood, and Dem Franchize Boyz. Dem Franchize Boyz are easily the worst of the three groups I mentioned, their CD is not worth buying, but if you like good beats to cruise to then burn their CD. I would definitely try the Boyz N Da Hood CD which is much tighter than this, random compilation of beats. Young Jeezy and Jody Breeze are two decent rappers, and Crime Mobb is pretty good, but Dem Franchize Boyz have no good rappers at all. The only remotely good song is ""Where I'm From""."
3,A Tad better then Crime Mob,"Lets start off with the reviews right off the bat.""Where I'm from"" is an okay crunk single but has terrible lyrics.""Fight2""is a little better lyrically but of course it is still not that great.""White Tee"" sounds a lot better on the CD then it does on the TV screen.""When we date"" sounds to J-Kwon are Nick Cannon for my taste. ""Dats da way dey roll3"" has a nice beat to it and on an album like this is a top form song.""Do ya dance girl"" offers nothing at all that is new but maybe a nice Flow but thats about it. The Next track has an okay beat to it.""Play no games"" sounds a little like a fat Lil Jon Track but it is not up to Jon standards.""Slap ya witta bank"" has a okay beat to it and is some more Crunk.""Oh I think they like me"" is okay too.""Hit da dirt4"" has tight beat to it.""Choppaz & 9s"" ends the song talking about some gun violence better then other one.Lyrics-3 Production-7 X Factor-6 Classic-3 Replay-6Total=5 out of 10 Fingers"
1,It's Dem Wack Boyz,"I love south music like three 6, lil jon, master p, but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead. Man JD is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he can't get no one wit talent. every song on here sounds like it was hurried up. Fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick."
3,Well..........,"I'm not really a so called ""CRUNK"" music fan but i think this cd was koo. I think once u start listenin to it you'll start bobbin yo head like, oh this is tight. But, uhh if you ""pay attention"" the rappin is garbage. They use the same rhymes through out the whole cd and arguably the same beat through out the cd. I just play it when i feel like bobbin my head and hearin some tight beats. I mean ""honestly"" i burned it, but i would recommend buyin it if you like ""crunk"" stuff such as lil jon, lil scrappy and all that. Best Songs: Fight, White Tee, Bi**h Ni**as, 45's Choppas....., Oh I Think Dey Like Me, the other ones is koo. oh yea and like IN all my reviews, DON'T FORGET THE TUPAC CD PEACE!!!!!"
1,Dem Franchize Boyz,"Dem Franchize Boyz 1/2 Star.This has got to be the worst albums of the year,not since Beg for mercy by the incredibly awful G-Unit has had a mess of a debut such as this, And White Tees is the most pathetic song in hip hop history and everything else is not that good, Why would they sign to a record company anyway?they have no talent, just image and stupidityDem Franchize Boyz should be called Dem One Hit Wonders soon."
1,Garbage,the only thing worth listening to one this album is the beats. White Tee is the only song worth anything on the CD and once you have heard that you have heard the whole thing. these dudes cant rap at all. the CD is very repetitive. Basically keep your money and dont waste it on this trash. As long as nobody buys this garbage these lames will stay in a white tee. yup
1,stupid,"Anybody who makes a song about a white tee is stupid, think about what your listening to, didn't even have to buy the cd to know these guys have no skill"
5,amazing!,"lights amazing. works great with the sound, i placed the box on the outside of my case and ran the cables thru the water cooling ports. love the product! highly recommended"
4,Meh,"It lights up. Doesnt really work with music, it sometimes lights up when the bass hits, but its really inconsistant."
1,Sucked,Purchased this to replace the one that was burnt out in my husbands computer. Got it within 4-5 days installed it the day it was received. well it only lasted 8 hours total use. was very disappointed with the product. when it work it was great but it should last longer than a few hours
5,"The15"" Logisys Deluxe Sound Activated Cold Cathode its a total success","Well this Item is great. It fits perfectly In My ThermalTake Armor+ MX,The item works as it should be. it also have sound reconize control so you can ajuge how mutch you want it to understand the sound. also its perfect for gamers that want something cool and exotic in the PC case. I personaly love it, My Suggestion is to buy 2 of those on for the top part and one for the bottom .over all its a kick ass protact"
3,meh,this product does work and well but not exactly what i was looking for i wanted more of some thing that would beat with my base and this just goes with all sounds
2,15 inch sound activated CCFL Kit,"Pros, it works as advertised when set at full power only, I think? Cons, Even at full power settings, the lights don't put out as much light as if they were hooked up to nothing but a power coupler. Furthermore, in order for it to work at all regarding sound sensitivity, you would have to install the lights right next to a sound source/speakers, or whatever, but as they are as shipped, it takes a nice little tap on the side of your tower to make the light to change with the change of the pitch or volume of your sound source. I should have just bought a couple straight up cathode tubes in blue to get what I was really looking for, and will in the future. Anyhow, when turned up to their max setting, they do work, but not as advertised. Have fun folks......"
5,"I am 34 and this is one of my favorite books, seriously.",So beautifully written and the full story (for those disappointed movie viewers from the 80's). Profound truths of self inquiry on a path of adventure make this a great read over and over.
5,"Easy read, childhood fantasies","This book is easy enough to get through. There is always something going on and happens to be more eventful than either of the movies made from it.A sweet tale, appreciating the presentation in hardcover is all the more rewarding."
5,WHAT A BOOK!,"Well, I am busy reading this wonderful book for, is it the 30th time? It actually was the first English novel that I read that time as a 12 year old. I remember it took me 21 days to get through it that time(English is my 2nd language) I was intrigued by the bi-colored printing of the text(I think that was the reason I took it out of the library) and it was wonderful!!!!!! Unfortunately the hardcover version at our local library was put on the blacklist and now I have to read the paperback in which the text is black, but the red parts of the hardcover was italicized - EECK - it certainly takes away the sheer magic of the story!!! I recommend it for young and old!!!!!!!"
5,Any fantasy lover should read this book!,"If you've seen the movie, you've only gotten a taste of what this book has to offer. The movie is only an abbreviated adaptation of the first half of the book, and the sequels are simply spin-offs of the first movie. This book has so much more to offer! It's a story about the importance of imagination and fantasy, self-discovery and identity, and the importance of discovering what is truly important in your heart. At the very least the story in these pages is one of the greatest fantasy stories you will ever read... and if you truly open your heart to the story, you will walk away a better person after having read it."
5,I wish it never-ended!,"Having grown up loving the movie, I had to read the book as an adult. I love the movie just the way it is, but knowing when it was made (without CG, special effests, etc..) I knew lots of really cool stuff had probably been left out.The book is actually both movies (1&2) so that was cool since I have only seen the second one a couple of times. (We all know is stinks compared to the first one. Of course gotta love J.B - RIP)I wouldn't mind seeing a few of these left out parts in a new version of the movie, like the desert and lion part.I only wish this one had the Orin on the cover like in the movie, that would be sweet. Also, I thought it was cool that the book is printed in two different color inks, one for the world of Fantasia, and one for bastians' world. Neat!"
5,THE NEVERENDING STORY,"I LOVE WATCHING THE VIDEO OF THE NEVERENDING STORY, I HAVE GIVEN THE EMPRESS OF FANTASIA A NEW NAME SO HERE IT IS, WAIT FOR IT.F------A------N------T------A------S-------I-------A. FANTASIA.I LOVE READING THE STORY BUT MY ONLY WISH WOULD BE TO THE HARDBACK COPY OF THE NEVERENDING STORY. I HAVE GOT FOUR WISHES.(1). I, LEE LUCKHAM WOULD LOVE TO MEET FANTASIA (EMPRESS OF FANTASIA).(2). I, LEE LUCKHAM WILL SAVE FANTASIA & HER WORLD FANTASIA.(3). FOR SIEEDA TO HAVE A HEART.(4). FOR GOMORG TO HAVE A HEART.I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THE VIDEO'S THE BOOK & THE SOUNDTRACK OF THE NEVERENDING STORY.... TAKE CARE. YOURS TRULY MR LEE LUCKHAM."
3,Fantastic,"This book is alot longer than the beloved movie version, but fantastic nonetheless.I was disappointed when my faovrite scenes weren't in the book:""Atreyu, why are you so sad?""(sobbing) ""I've failed you, Empress!""(she smiles) ""No . . . you haven't.""Yeah, I'm a nerd and I love the end of the movie. But let's not toss aside the book. It's wonderful because not only does all the cool stuff in the movie happen, but once sebastian has saved Fantasia, he gets to have his own written adventures in the imagined world.I can't remember, but I believe there was a battle with a witch and her giants, an archy contest, and much more, before Sebastian finally learns what he came to Fantasia to learn and is sent home to his father -- who awakens from the grief of lossing his wife and remembers his son.If you love fantasy and adventure, check this book out, even if you don't buy it right away."
1,"Misleading title, ends.","Imagine my dismay when, after deciding I needed to cut down on my book buying, I purchased and then finished this ""Neverending"" story in two days.No really, imagine it."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"The first 100 pages were good, original, and well written. Once Bastian enters Fantastica, the book goes downhill. It seems that all of the events with Bastian were drawn from a hat at random. The story doesn't develop anything for the rest of the book, and I could care less about anything in the story other than finishing it, and stopping the torture of reading this awful piece of literature."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,I read the first half of this book in under a week. I continued to read and found the same events to be occuring over and over. This book is horribly repetative and boring. The writing is atrocious. Do not read this book!
4,Starts off great....,"Well, I watched the Neverending story constantly as a kid and still love the movie today as one of my favorites. The book starts off great in my opinion there were some small differences with names and things like Fantastica instead of Fantasia but halfway through the book it is pretty much where the movie ends. But, the book keeps going and Bastian takes a whole seperate adventure it is almost like two books. I could be biased from watching the movie first and not reading the book but. I still enjoyed the first half of the book but the end seemed to drag and I found Bastians adventure kind of boring."
4,this is a nice story if you like fantasy novels,"Well i accidentally stumbled across The Neverending Story when i was looking for another of Michael Ende's book, Momo, and ever since i have read it no fewer than six times and each time i was as enthralled as the first time i read it. Why? you may ask. the story is intensely exciting, and the characters are incredibly believable and at the end of the book you wish it wasnt over. Bastian was an incredible hero, and the best part is at the end, when he begins to lose his meemory. i totally reccomend it for readers of all ages"
4,"If you loved the film, this book is like two films--a spectacular part I and a so-so part II","*** Spoilers Ahead ***For fans of the 1984 Wolfgang Peterson film that haven't read The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, the imaginative work the film is based on, learning the movie only accounts for the first half of the book can be a startling realization. For me, it was like discovering an authentic, not-quite-a-sequel continuation to one of my favorite childhood stories--sort of like unearthing a buried treasure you didn't know was hidden.Unfortunately the second half is not nearly as good as the first, and other reviewers have said as much. Perhaps I'm biased since I was awed by the movie at such a young age, but I feel the producers were right to focus solely on the first part and end the movie just as Bastian enters Fantasia (or Fantastica, as it's named in the novel).Thankfully, the book's conclusion redeems where the story lags. I recommend this one for fans of fantasy and YA novels."
4,A very good book. It was almost like the movie,"When I first read this book, I was surprised that it was not like the movie. I have seen the movie many times, I almost know it by heart, and when I read the book, I liked it a little better than the movie.Some parts of the book were confusing, but when I firgured them out, they were not that confusing anymore. When I finished the book, I began to read other fasinating books like Animal Farm, Peter Pan, and I am right now reading The Princess and the Goblin. I hope that one day, you will read these books too."
3,I didn't like fantasies until I read this book!,"It's about a boy named Bastian who steals a book from a bookstore and runs away to read it. He reads it constantly. Finally, he realizes that he is one of the characters in The Neverending Story, would definitely recommend to 12 year olds and anyone."
3,Younger group of readers.,This book was for a younger group of readers. It would have been a great book if I was a bit younger.
3,Neverending Story paperback,"It arrived within the time that the seller said it would. It is in good condition, but a couple of the pages look like they might have gotten a little mushed in shipping. I had thought that, like the hardcover the print would be in different colors to signify when you're in the real world and when you are in Fantastica."
5,Expand your imagination,"After I saw the movie,I decided to read this book.I found more ""Movie Efect"" through out the pages. The magical Oring,the childlike Princess,the colorful lion in the desert,the neverending story book that write itself for all the time,the white luck dragon .... You will love it and read it again and again after you enter mindly in to the land of Fantasia,but you will never get lost in there,because you have so many lovely friends from the story.And after you finish it,you shall realize that there's always an begining after the end.There's no really bad guys in the story,but the only thing to destroy the dreamland is the lose of our imagination.So keep your mind going on working and get the access to Fantasia."
5,Do What You Wish,"This is one of my top five books of all time, and I've read a lot.... The story of Basitan is a dark farie tale, at once enticing us to follow our dreams and reminding us that we cannot let those dreams control us. Bastian is all of us at one time or another - passed over, kicked around and so enamoured of his fantasy world that he nearly loses the real one. I saw myself in there, as have many other people.As others have said, the movies cannot compare to the book. I loved the first movie, and still do. I give some credit to the second for at least trying to make the attempt to follow the book. I refuse to acknowledge the existence of the third.This is one that I recommend heartily and without reservation. And when you are done, give it to someone else.It's that kind of book...."
5,One Of My Best Childhood Memories!,"I first read the The Neverending Story a couple of years agowhen I was about 12 and I loved it from the very start! It is a powerful and captivating story and I personally can't understand people who don't like it! But please don't bother watching the movies though! They are not worth your time, especially when you know the book! I was very surprised when I came to the US (I am German) and found that most of the people here either haven't read it or even don't even know about it! This is pretty sad and I am trying to change that at least a little bit by recommending it to everybody and by givng at as a present to my friends! If you haven't read it so far, do it NOW! To give a ""summary"" of it would be a crime, you really have to read it, there is no way around it!"
5,The Neverending Story,"I have been looking for this book for years and finally I have it!Its a wonderful and enchanting story, you get to meet many charming characters along the way, discovering the fantasy world of Fantastica.A beautifully written story tale for both young and old."
5,"Magic, pure magic","If you never read the neverending story, do it now! that's what I can recommend.This book has captured my mind for many years, and I'm sure it'll capture you too, if you have some fantasy in your heart.I had the luck of seeing the movie first. Though funny and sweet, it does not even scratch the cover of the book.The story is breathtaking, the charachters full of life and the end, that's what I loved most.(I can even admit I had tears in my eyes when I turned the last page).Did I already say I recommend it?"
5,Truly Imaginative and Ten times better than the Movie,"To say this book is ten times better than the movie is quite a lot from me considering I grew up loving the movie. However, the movie lacks a depth and imagination that the book serves in giant portions. I only wish I spoke and read German so I could read it in its original language. I am sure there are things lost in the translation and seeing how creative it is in english, I can only imagine what the original text would be like."
5,"Wow, if you liked the movie, you'll love this book!","Although I haven't watched this movie recently, I've always loved it. And after reading this book, I can't wait for the new remake to come out. The movie is very loosely based on the book, but never the less I love them both. Although the book is easy to follow, the detail of the picture the words paint in your mind is wonderfully elaborate. I received the book last week and have been reading it every chance I get and I just finished it a couple minutes ago. It makes me want to go home and watch the movie.I am 34 years old and don't do much fictional reading, but if you liked the movie this book is a must read. There's just so many more characters, plots and background information than in the movie. I have such a warm fuzzy feeling inside now :)"
5,My daughter's favorite forever,"My German friend recommended this book to me 22 years ago and I instantly fell in love with the world Ende had created. I was sad to leave the characters when I finished the book and promised them I would be back when I had my own child.I bought the book when my daughter became 7 and she also fell in love with this world. We shared favorite parts, funny parts, and sad parts, and that was the best part of coming back to Fantastica to me. My daughter is in high school now, but it's still her favorite."
5,Better than Advertised,The book I ordered was in better condition than the seller had said. Absolutely perfect....
4,Great Book,"I don't think I will ever get tired of this book. I had forgotten that it had the two different colors of text. Way better than the movies... The cover is not my favorite, I wish they had one with an Auron on the front."
5,One of the Best,"Just as bastian was reading Atryus story, and living the story it was easy to find yourself doing the same things that Bastian was doing. I f elt like I was really there and at times I was even wanting to see the childlike empress with Bastian. I also longed to be in fantasia, even now. This book is excellent and I would read it over and over if I could. The imagry is a work of heart and I tip my hat to the writer."
3,It was okay...,"It came in the time promised and was in pretty good condition. It was brand new, so I wish more care had been taken in packing, because the cover was bent a little on the edges, but other than that it was okay."
3,I liked the movie better.,"This was the audio book of the story.It was OK, but I felt like it was too long.I was glad to get the chance to listen to it,but it had quite a different feel then the movie."
3,Book 1,"I've read books that told stories within stories before (Cloud Atlas comes to mind first). I really like Valente as an author. She has a way of describing locations, people, and food that makes the story come to life. Her imagination is endless (and slightly bizarre). This isn't a book for young children. It's meant for older teenagers and adults. I've started the second book, which is much darker. The issue with this type of story telling is that if you do not read every day, you will loose the connections and forget the numerous characters quickly. I took my time with the beginning of the book and sped my reading up towards the end. It was when I started reading at a more regular pace that I could fully appreciate how Valente tied some of the stories together"
5,Great Book!,"This book tells a great story! Be ready to follow it carefully because it loops around at times but each story carefully comes to an end. If you loved 1001 Arabian Tales, you will love this book."
3,Structurally unsound,"Read the first half (book one). Second half lost me almost immediately, both my interest and comprehension. It's a difficult book to read, due to the nested stories. It's a neat idea in theory, but it disrupts the story flow. Would be better if each story was kept separate, and intact, IMO. Or rewrite the whole thing as a cohesive novel.Valente is an excellent writer, though the prose gets a bit purple at times. She overuses similes, to the point the writing almost becomes self-parody at times. There is a tremendous intelligence and imagination at work here. Definitely a writer to keep an eye on.In response to the ""you shouldn't review a book you haven't read"" crowd: I think my experience with this book is worth reporting. I'm sure I'm not the only reader who gave up on this book, given how difficult it is to follow. If you like straight narrative, this book is not for you. I think that's worth putting out there."
2,didn't fit my hand,the watch itself is very nice but it needs a man with wide arm. after i bought it i resold it again because its size.
1,more time in the shop than on my wrist,This watch looks great but the internal mechanism which you are supposed to be able to see on the face simply will not move correctly. The watch keeps good time but obviously not because these gears work or not. Would not buy again
4,LSOH rocks...,"i'll be doing this show in a couple of months and I was glad to have the CD, the only disappointment is it lacks COMPLETE recordings of some of the songs, and even leaves out a couple of songs completely...other wise the CD is great...Ellen Greene is amazing..."
4,Great show- but casting could've been better...,"I first heard this particular recording about a year ago when we were beginning to block a production of it. As a vocalist, I take issue with quite a bit of the casting, and I have to concur with another reviewer: this Seymour lacks the ""lovable loser"" angst that makes him a sympathetic character. One good thing about this recording, though, is that it's much more faithful to the music and plot of the stage version as opposed to the movie. Ellen Greene is outstanding, as always, and the Ronettes are pretty darn spiffy. If you're getting ready to be in this show and the only thing you've seen is the 1986 movie, you REALLY, REALLY need to give this a listen."
4,Great music!,"This is one of the best musicals of all time. The music, from Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, is easily better than their work for Disney. The pop influence is great. While the soundtrack to the 1986 movie is more polished, this one has more of the raw feel of a Broadway show, as it should."
5,Best Musical Ever,"I've been listening to this soundtrack for 15 years and it is still great. A great recording of one of the funniest and most original musicals in US History. The quirky lyrics, great music and voices are a good addition to any music library. GET THIS ! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE !"
5,It's just plain great!,"Words are a difficult thing to be used to describe this CD, which combines several different music variations. The best aprt is that, even though the music soundtrack is great, this one holds true to the original!"
1,Dollar Store Vanilla Scent,"I had such high hopes for this product. Ever since L'occitane discontinued it's vanille line I have been search for something to replace it. Sadly, I stumbled upon this product & foolishly thought maybe, just maybe it would smell something like what I was looking for. Boy was I wrong. This ""perfume"" smells like a cheap, dollar store , vanilla scented candle. You know the type I'm talking about, right? Overly sweet, strangly fake vanilla scent that FYI DOES NOT WASH OFF. So basically, I reeked all day from this stuff. Majorly dissappointed to say the least.In fairness to the seller - my order was packaged well & I received the product very quickly.That's all the good I can say. My $18.00 perfume went straight into the trash. I would have given it away, but I didn't want to stumble upon the one person who would actually wear this nasty smelling stuff and be forced to smell this ""scent"" day after day."
2,Technically faulty,"I have no problem with the music or the singing. Both operas are lovely as well as the voices. But there are annoying breaks between the tracks. A new track sometimes starts with a skip. Since I bought my copy on e-bay, I thought it was pirated an poorly executed, but it seems that this is a universal problem with this set."
5,Works perfectly and have lasted well over two winters,"Purchased with a second set of rims and tires for winter driving.In comparison to the VW original ""locking"" bolts these are more attractive, just as effective, and considerably less expensive.Highly recommended, especially paired with matching chrome-finish non-locking bolts."
5,Too Funny,This has been one of my favorite movies since I was a little girl. You just can't beat a movie that has Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy!!
5,great,exactly what i ordered. came quickly. i haven't opened it yet to play it because it is a gift. definitely cost effective.
5,Classic comedy at it's finest!,Harlem Nights is one of those movies that never gets old. The cast of characters is amazing and the comedy is raw. I think if you threw this movie in the air..it would turn into sunshine!
3,Big Blue and Sassy Black,"One pair fit just right, but the other pair was HUGE! Granny poonanny huge. So, if you don't mind getting a cute pair and one to clean the toilet, go for it."
2,spandex and cotton blend in the most unfortunate blue,I can't imagine who could pull off these clown pants. They're unwearable! What was Hanes thinking?
4,Worth the $.01 I spent on it,Worth the penny that I spent on it. Some great songs and some filler that I don't remember ever being popular.
2,An OK CD,About 3/4 of the songs are club songs . The other songs just seemed out of place and are not dance songs.
3,ashley,"it's okay, #1 on both cd's are the best but u can definitly live without the cd. half the people i havent even heard of."
3,not quite the mark of today,"This book has issues.1. Some items discussed are really dated. It should be updated with newer BI strategies, and cover more dashboard and WEB 2.0 technologies.2. The author is very knowledgeable and lays out complex topics in easy to understand parts, so it is even more important to allow for an update.3. Being used as textbook as it was in a course in BI recently, there should be more examples and online source material available.4. More Agile development should be included.5. Again, the book has huge potential and only falls short in a few places, but does a great job in covering the complexity of BI in easy to understand ways. I would consider this a great book for reference and should be included in any BI library or resource lists."
1,Hurlyburly,"Honestly, didn't enjoy reading this play. It's flat and obnoxiously slimy. I finished the whole play, but it was a struggle to read it all because I found it so boring."
4,David Rabe is Awesome,"Great plays. Hurly Burly is one of the most character-rich, deeply self-reflective exercises for actors I've seen. Great for young professionals."
2,"Wordy, Wordy","I'll limit my remarks to Hurlyburly. Wordy. Way too wordy. Way too long as a play. Maybe two acts too long. With characters that, by act 2, I grew to hate. Their endless droning and complaining was boring and seemingly pointless. I didn't like these characters, didn't find them interesting and didn't find them to be intelligent or insightful enough to hold three acts together. I'll stop right here. I don't want to appear to be too wordy."
2,Got a wrong item,"i just got a wrong item,but Eastbay called me before i got the item and promised me to send me back the correct item, but since i live outside EUA it will cost me a lot of money to send the wrong item back so i decided to let things that way and keep the item i got, finally Eastbay/Amazon credit me part of the money i spent in the transaction."
3,tapered cylinder,"After measuring the fairly large quadruple rolls we buy, and comparing to the stated diameter of this holder, I thought I was OK.However, since the cylinder is tapered, only one roll will fit, and even then it's very difficult to get out. If you buy regular or double rolls, you'd probably be fine. Other than that, it's slightly translucent, so there's no mistaking what's inside it."
2,Orb Toilet Paper Holder,"This item is a bit flimsier than I was expecting and it narrows down at the bottom so the new bigger Costco toilet paper rolls don't quite fit all the way to the bottom without jamming it in fairly hard. It needs to be another 1/4"" bigger in diameter and then it'd work fine."
2,Some good ideas if you can take the writing,"It's not that this book doesn't offer some decent ideas for where to go for a weekend away. There are some. But what the book lacks is variety of type of escape and colorful, insider-info writing. Written by two moms who met on a park bench while their kids were playing in the sandbox, all of the trips tend to take on a girls-weekend-away feel, combined with soft, gushy writing about delightful places to have lunch, quaint towns, and cute places to stay. I was turned off by several places that just seemed too precious and longed for more variety in the types of places to visit."
4,Good but somewhat outdated,"Love the idea of the book, although some info is outdated. Like lots of things, beauty is in the eye of thebeholder. Great because of its original ways to travel and think about travel. Recommended."
4,Dodge B-Series,"If you are restoring one of these old trucks this book has alot of factory accurate photos and descriptions. It is however mainly concerned with asthetics; interior, exterior, bed variations. If you want to know what the interior looked like when your truck was original or what the paint should be on the nose this is the book for you. It should be noted that all the photos are black and white, accompanied by detailed description. If you need to know how to rebuild the drive train this book will get you nowhere."
4,A MUST READ FOR THOSE PURSUING ENGLISH,"The Nick Adams Stories is an excellent example of the 'conscious' writer. Each story reflects the journalistic quality of Hemingway while revealing his timeless literary style. Hemingway once said that ""what you see of an iceburg is only 1/8 of it, 7/8 are still under water. This is true as when reading the Nick Adams Stories,the reader immediately grasps only part of it. They must go under the water and discover the other 7/8 of this author's masterpiece, his style and literary uniqueness."
4,A Peach,"The Nick Adams Short Stories offer an in-depth detailed look at a young boys life. The book takes us through his early childhood years and progress through all of his stages of manhood. The Author Ernest Hemingway writes a story that is very easy reading. The stories in this novel are individual, however at the same time they all tie in together at the end. The book can either be read one story at a time or in any chronological order. I believe any reader can easily understand this book, and for someone who would like to get interested in Hemingway's works reading this book would be a good starting point and will probably turn you on to some of his more famous writings."
1,I didn't get it,"I decided to check this book out because it was recommended in the newspaper. I really didn't understand why they recommended book. It started ok, but nothing interesting happens. I barely finished it. I know it's a collection, but it is not seamless and doesn't really make sense to me. I wish I wouldn't of wasted the time with it."
1,grin and bear it,"If you had to read this for school (as I did), then just grin and bear it (chocolate helps)... If you're looking this up voluntarily, don't buy it, for the sake of your poor sanity. Hemingway is dry, dry, dry. Of course, the titles of the stories can be pretty (I'm trying to rationalize my having to read the book at all), but after this I'm going to throw away any book that mentions the phrase 'illegal trout selling.' The stories are disjointed, characters confusing, and I didn't find Nick halfway likeable as a person. Eep..."
3,Jung,"This book is a must for anyone who wants to know more about Jung. The poetry and mythology are actually more interesting than the psychology. Jung was a brave trail blazer going boldly where no man had gone before. Yet he makes too much of the Oedipus story and this is more Freud's fault than Jung's. To associate the Oedipus drama, a purely fictional creation, with Western theology is a pretty warped idea. If you can filter out the Jungian sexual obsessions, it is a pretty thought provoking work."
5,Another Great CD From Point Of Grace,Point of Grace is one of my favorite Christian music groups. The four girls' singing blends together wonderfully! The Whole Truth is their second album and just as good as their first!
5,This CD is a must-have for any Christian or music lover.,"The vocals on this CD is fantastic. The songs are extremely well-written. The harmonies are phenomenal. Simply because of this one CD, I am purchasing all other Point of Grace CDs. I'm sure, on the basis of this CD, that they won't let me down."
5,Awesome!,"The Whole Truth is just that, the whole truth - I loved it. You should listen to this album. Nobody can really explain the beauty in it, you must listen for yourself - I guarantee, you will be hooked!"
5,POG's best album,This is the most joyful and uplifting CD Point of Grace has made. May God bless them always.
3,Typical Point of Grace,"This album has clever gems like ""The Great Divide"" and ""Dying to Reach You."" Also potent is ""The Love He Has for You"" which delicately underlines virginity and celibacy: not an easy topic to sing about.Some of the other songs are a bit formulaic in content and arrangement; you may have the feeling you've heard these songs before, even on your first listen. But that's what makes pop music comfortable, isn't it? There's nothing here that will challenge you as a musical listener.True to form, the girls lace virtually every tune with their glossy, over-the-top harmonies which can sometimes be overwhelming. But when they hit the nail on the head, you just might get chills. They are a group worth keeping tabs on."
3,"Story OK, Spelling and Grammar AWFUL","I have read all the books in the series and each has bad grammar and spelling errors, but this one is as bad as it gets; you literally have to guess at the word that is misspelled; Some have symbols instead of letters; it makes me think that this was outsourced to India or Russia or China. When you think about it, it's digital, the author had to write it on a computer...how could it get so messed up. Robert Doherty, you should be ashamed of yourself and your team for letting this be sold in this condition."
5,Bob Mayer series,"Read all the Gate series and Area 51 by Bob Mayer, don't know if any are left to read, they both ended with a ""What's Next""."
4,Atlantis,"Good series of books, enjoyed very much. Interesting story, kept me reading non stop. Very interesting theory on Atlantis and where it could have been."
3,Keeps you going,"I choose a three star rating for this book as I have to admit it, after the lead up from the other books in the series, was a little bit disappointing the way it ended.I know that an author has to assume that some readers may not have read the other books prior to reading this one but did they have to refer so much of the book's text to previous books?I ended up skipping the recircled bits from previous books which were repeated in every book before hand.It seemed that each book reviewed a large part of what had happened in the previous book - including the review in that part. This caused the last book to contain a large amount of information about what had happened previously.It was good - but I was glad in a way that it finished the series."
2,Not very entertaining,"This book was not as good as the rest of the series. There was constant discussion of science theory, gate theory, mystical power, and little character development. There was a minmimal amount of plot. The storyline was not advanced. i should have skipped this one."
3,Worm Drive Saws,"I think most of the worm drive saws are dependable. Skill saw has paved the way for most of us. This saw has the name brand and all - bosch. Overall I like the saw. The only thing I had to adjust to was is the visiablity. The base plate is by far strong than other base plates but I notice the difference at the blade. Its a smaller opening compared to the skil saw. I recommend going to a store to compare worm drives in ""feel"" first before buying. I like this saw but some would prefer other features over others. On a positive its a strong saw. This one will last forever. No complaints there. Being a lefty I am inclined for visibility though. If I was right handed though it would be an easy 5 star."
5,Al Kovalick,"I am about to purchase this book. I saw the HARDBOUND version in a book store and was very impressed. The paperback version is only 36 pages so I imagine it can't be of the same quality. Each of the pictures in the HB version appears as an actual photo -- glossy with bright colors. I compared this to ""London from the air"" by Hawkes and that book is very well done. However, this book has a good mix of close ups, land-based shots and shots from the air. I just spent 9 months in London and this book will be our ""coffee table"" memory of the trip."
5,"Beautiful, evocative writing that will stay with you","Laurie Lee's writing is beautiful, simple and elegant: down-to-earth but poetic. I first read this book when I was 14. Twelve years later, it's still in my all-time top three. It is incredibly evocative of Spain before the Civil War - it describes a place and a moment in history seen through the excited eyes of a youth. It is nostalgic but not unrealistic. Read it. You won't regret it!"
5,Yay for flags! I teach Macbeth!,I was so glad to be able to purchase this great product. It is hanging in my classroom and will stay there this year since I teach British Literature! The product came in perfect condition!
4,A must have for C++ programmers learning Builder!,"This book is excellent if you need a starting point for programming in Builder. It gives examples and illustrations that will help C++ programmers convert their knowledge to Builder. If you are looking for a quick, easy introduction to Builder, get this book. Also, don't worry if it is for an older version of Builder, the versions are close enough in format to keep it understandable."
1,A complete waste of good paper,"The ""for Dummies"" in the title should be an alert to the buyer. The Dummy part I did was parting with any money for this complete waste of paper. A lot of waffle, and no progress or REAL teaching of how to use Builder. Everything is presented as ""just type this, trust me, it works"". The CD was even more useless... except for use as a coaster."
4,Polyester vs. Nylon,"I have been buying the nylon flags, but the colors do fade quickly. I bought this flag because is is 1/3 the price. I bought it to see how well the flag especially the blue field hold its color."
2,Broke after a few wears,"It's extremely difficult to find these shirt stays anywhere. This was the only site I was able to find them on. Shipping was prompt and I had no problems ordering, however they broke after only a few wears. My husband uses these on a regular basis and he's gone through 4 of them already. One strap broke the first time he put them on. They have good service, but the product doesn't hold up to everyday use."
1,Poor design,"I own these shirt stays in the white color and I hate them.They're great when they work correctly, but they are a very bad design. The clips do not stay clipped unless you really jam the fabric up under the loop, and even then they don't always stay where you want them. I have also found that they stretch out over a relatively short period of time (but then again, they are only $5 for a set). You get what you pay for. There's nothing quite like feeling squared away only to be walking down the hall or talking to someone important and have your shirt stay pop off and fall out the leg of your trousers.I recommend either the hidden tailor or finding another brand of shirt stay that uses a real clip rather than just a rubber/metal loop design that relies entirely on friction and constant tension."
2,One nut check too many.,After 30 minutes of wearing these I got my first nut check from one in front that snapped off. I went straight to the restroom at work and took them off.
1,Military Shirt Stays Beware,"Military shirt stays must be used by people that are taller than 5' but shorter than 6'2. These shirt stays are capable of winning the war for the enemy. When the packaging was made up for the product did anyone actually look at what the military actually needed or did they they try to sell the military something else that they did not need? In a field modification I will change a few things on these military shirt stays and hope that I don't hurt myself. Unfortunately I don't have many options for a refund since I need them for July 8. Eureka, the manufacturer hates our military and is intent on selling them equipment that could get our service members injured."
2,Fail,These are clearly youth-sized. If my knees are bent and I'm wearing knee socks I can attach these but walking is impossible (I'm 5'10). Can't judge the quality because I can't use them. Will be returning.
2,not sure who these fit,"these must be designed for use with knee socks they are very short in comparison to the shirt stays I've had before. These are maybe 12"" fully extended."
4,They do the job,I've been using these for a month and they're holding much better than some that I've bought before. I would definitely buy them again.
1,Broke second wear,Don't waste you money. One of the stays came apart the second time I used it. Very poor quality. Metal pieces are cheap and poorly put together.
2,Poor,"Used these once, and the bands started fraying and ripped by the second attempt to wear them. Yes I've used these for years for my dress uniforms and the ones I used before (military issue im guessing from army barracks) I cannot find. I bought these hoping for the same standard but they are sub par and in the trash."
2,Short and difficulet,"Extremely short, I am 6' and even extended to their max they are way to short. On top of that the clip button attachmets keep poping off my shirt if the shirt material is at all thick. I would personally look elsewhere."
3,Shirt Stay,We can't really say to much about this product since we did not get a chance to use this item. By the reports from others they are awesome and we can't wait for an opportunity to use the item
2,Clips stink,"The clips on these things are made for light weight material like nylon stockings. The sock end works ok, but clipping the things to a shirt with heavier material and getting them to hold is a pain in the neck."
3,straight shirt stays,"they are good quality but these are a lot shorter than the ones I got before, luckily I am only 5 foot 7 inches so if I extend them all the way out to the longest, they fit OK, but I cannot recommend them to anyone taller, Ok for men shorter than 5 foot 7 inches only, wish they had pointed that out in the ad"
3,Meh,"They did what they're supposed to do... for a time. I personally find the vanguard ones to be better (the ones you buy at military clothing), however I wasn't in the military when I bought these. Now I am. The clips that maintain the length and tightness to hold down your shirt don't hold up very well. I ended up having to staple these and using pliers to smash it down to maintain the length. I didn't work in a very hot and humid climate at the time I wore these so I didn't sweat a ton, so I can't comment on how rusty the clips that attach to your shirt get, but the Vanguard ones do rust (after a summer in Texas... yeah)."
3,Good for their intended use,"I've been using these for a number of years and they work great. My ONLY complaint with them is where the end is doubled-over and sticked back on itself is very week. Almost all of these fail within a couple of months, but is easily corrected by restitching or safety-pinning. I'm fat and my work-shirts won't stay tucked in without them. I will keep buying these despite the very minor design flaw."
1,It's not the same military shirt stay.,"It'll hold like the military shirt stays, but one of the ends will rub on your legs when you're constantly walking. The ohter thing is it's not long as the actual military shirt stay. Might as well go to the actual military surplus to buy it."
3,"Ok, if you're not too tall","These are typical shirt stays for those familiar with military dress, they are a little short for me (I am 6'3"") and as a result the hardware chafes a bit, but I expect that for those 6 feet and under, they will work great."
2,Clasp problems,Clasp do not hold well and do not fasten well they come undone allot so I stopped using them and I am going to purchase a better pair
4,Good stuff.,"I've owned a set of these since November of 2006 and I'm still using them. The only thing bad about them is that the metal part of the clip (as apposed to the plastic half) tends to bow outward after a while. This can lead to the stay becoming unattached which can be embarrassing if it pops off the shirt and you don't notice until someone points out you're dragging something behind you. As long as you look at the clip after you take them off at the end of the day and bend it so the clip has a narrower neck, it will never happen. I would definitely recommend this over the other set sold by Army Universe under the same name: Black Military Straight Shirt Stays 4 Pack. That's a total piece of crap!"
1,They stink.,THEY STRETCHED OUT AFTER A WEEK.. THEY WERE ALWAYS POPING OFF AND THE CLIPS WOULD NEVER STAY CLAMPED DOWN. I WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN.AND YES I DID USE THEM EXACTLY AS DIRECTED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS. POOR QUALITY PRODUCT. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR I HAD TO PICK SOMETHING OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THEM ANY STAR.
1,Cheap . . .,"I wore these three times before they fell apart. The elastic began to unravel/fray and the metal brackets broke. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,The clips are very cheaply made and the stiching will irritate your legs like crazy. It feels like they were stiched with fishing line.
3,eh,"They were too short for me. if I were a bit shorter they would work well, I'm not sure if you can order longer ones or not."
1,Dont buy!,"Sorry to say this, but they were useless. I've already thrown them away. I'm 6ft tall and had the straps extended all the way and they were still too short. The straps were always coming loose. I would literally be standing still and one would pop off. I've had several types of shirt stays and these are the worst. I don't like giving bad reviews, but it is what it is."
2,Little People,"Im not exactly a giant so i expected these to fit me fairly well. I was wrong, these straps look like they should be worn be an eight year old boy they are so short. Or maybe i just need some thigh high socks( i doubt thoses are military standard anyway) My point is if your over 5'8 i would not suggest buying these. This product is for short men"
2,Too short,These are too short use unless you wear a very long shirt and have dress socks that go almost up to your ankle (I am average height). Needs to be longer.
4,"A challenging literal translation, with excellent notes","The literal translation is precise but difficult. Excellent critical apparatus. Not the first translation to consult, but one that will help a motivated student understand Aristotle's early attempt to build a foundation of language for logic argumentation."
2,Misjudged,First time I heard this I couldn't tell a thing about her singing ability. Her voice was drowned out by the music. You couldn't tell a thing about it and you could barley understand what she was saying. It didn't sound nothing like David cassidy sang the original I think I love you. She might be able to sing but who could tell with this cd. It isn't worth the money. Sorry Cassidy Family.
1,leave the singing to jesse,i have never herd katie sing before butwhen i did i was shocked is that really her?i think she should stop the whole i want tofollow my dads foot steps thing. sorry katiei think you should leave the singing tojesse mccartney.
1,Are you joking...she STINKS,"I've heard girls' with bad voices before, but please...shes horrible. I think she needs take some voice lessons because she can't carry a tune at all. This is by far one of the worst, most boring songs I have ever listened to."
1,Not much talent here,"Giving her even one star was tough. She is a very pretty girl with absolutely no singing ability whatsoever. Who told this kid that she could sing???? She tried riding her Daddy's coat tails, and if she had talent, it would have worked!! This kid needs to stay in school or do some modeling. Singing is not her talent."
1,Just a bad song.,"I'm sure Katie can sing. However this song simply does not showcase her voice. By trying to ""modernize"" a classic, the producer of this song successfully made it sound like it was playing through a cd player on very low batteries. Everything just sounds a little off. And Katie is left trying to pick up the slack.My advice? Keep Katie Cassidy's name in mind. In five years, when she's an adult and can write some of her own music, this girl will go places. Just not yet."
2,"talented singer, boring CD.",She has a beautiful voice but she should have made some orginial songs to put on her album. If you want the song I think I love you buy Kaci's CD. She sings the same song but unlike Katie's her album has a varity of other songs. It's a waste of money to buy this CD for one song that's not even orginial. If Katie makes a second album I hope it's a full CD. Singles are fine but only when you have a regular album.
2,Not the Best Cover,"I have heard covers of this song by Kaci Battaglia and also Voices of the Beehive, both of which are better than this version. Katie's voice sounds rather weak and she shows no range whatsoever here. Her singing is very bland and the music overpowers it."
2,"The apple falls far from the tree, but she can move!","When watching VH1s Bubble Gum to Babylon I got a listen and look into Katie Cassidy as they documented her journey becoming a teen pop artist. Sorry to say the only redeeming factor were the moves she gained from choreographer/performance coach Frankie Anne. Frankie appears with Katie and deserves credit for allowing us to at least enjoy the visual aspects of Katie's performance. I could see young Ms. Cassidy learning how to move and perform better over time but that did not happen with her vocals. Katie worked hard under the guidance of a pro like Frankie Anne who brings out the visual pieces of Katie's puzzle and for that I give her credit. As for her singing - - - I wouldn't drop a dime or credit to buy this recording. It seems her voice requires lots more natural talent. Try as she may, the voice is just not strong enough. Kudos Frankie Anne on making the girl LOOK HOT. David she's a cute kid but not a recording artist."
1,i wish i could give this 0 stars,this is awful can i have my 3 dollars back i threw it in the garbage this sounds like an 11 yr trying to sing under water with a raspy voice and nails scratching on this chalk board this girl has no talent good thing her daddys rich we don't here much from her guess she didn't have the talent to make it in show buss maybe jesse mccarntey can support her talentless horish azz
3,Katie Cassidy,"I first heard of Katie Cassidy on VH1's Bubblegum Babylon. I thought she was pretty and talented. She is, but the song ""I Think I Love You"" doesn't showcase it.She should sing another song."
1,Damn my father for not being a pop star!,"Poor Katie Cassidy. She may not have been that repulsive of a pop star had she better promotion and production. Hate Kelly Osbourne as you may, but give her the respect she deserves when considering that her first (and ONLY song) wasn't a cover of daddy's ""Iron Man"" or any other Black Sabbath song. This girl has not only a lack of talent, but a lack of flare, and hell, a lack of anything that might make people mention her name twice. Sometimes CDs like this make me wonder if anyone without famous relatives can even make it in the music industry anymore. Norah Jones, the Wallflowers, Aaron Carter... the list of connections goes on forever. Is there any hope yet?"
1,Good looks and semi-famous dad do not equal instant hit,"If you ever needed proof that some people in the music business believe that kids are stupid, look no further than Katie Cassidy's excreable remake of ""I Think I Love You."" When I was watching ""Bubblegum Babylon,"" the VH1 special on teen idols on which Katie was showcased, I actually CHEERED when Radio Disney listeners shot this horrible single down as it so obviously deserved. There's hope yet for America's youth!The blame, however, should not be placed on Katie. It should be placed on her openly ambitious mother, who is milking the David Cassidy connection and her daughter's beauty for all it's worth. For his part, David barely acknowledges the poor kid. Babylon indeed."
4,Britney Watch Your Back,If ever there was a pop star made in heaven Katie is it. How cool that David Cassidy's daughter is carrying on the Cassidy musical tradition. With the right songs and management she could go far; she's a beauty with real talent. American Idol? Who needs the TV show--we have found our new American idol right here.
2,"not really a mystery, definitely not a thriller","This book is really about the moral dilemmas/struggles that Martin Bora goes through as he learns more about those who are now in power in 1939 Germany, those whose side he is supposed to be on. The murder of the Catholic sister is almost irrelavant, didn't really contribute to the main story line. The character of Father Malecki also did'nt really seem to have a purpose except as an excuse for Bora to go back to the place of the murder. This book is not a page-turner; a lot of time is spent with Bora trudging back and forth from interrogations to inspections to the apartment he shared with his fellow army officer. I was truely looking forward to a real mystery set in WWII Germany as described in some of the reviews. This was definitely not a murder mystery and no where near to being a psychological thriller."
5,Fantastic Story,"I had no interest in the Warhammer universe whatsoever until I bought the boardgame ""Horus Heresy"" by Fantasy Flight.The game stirred my interest in the story, and so I bought this book which is the first in a series of books that tell the story of the ""Horus Heresy"".It was great! I could hardly put this book down. I highly recommend it to anybody who loves Science Fiction!Of course you'll then be forced to buy the rest of the books in the series."
3,Only average,"As an avid reader of military SF, I found this book to barely be able to hold my attention. I will try the next book in the series with the hope of some improvement."
1,Horus Rising,As much as I liked the story it didnt make much sense without the rememberancer views in it. The readers voice makes me want to punch someone though
3,Promising start to the series,"A friend who is also a big gamer recommended this series to me. This is the first book in the Horus Heresy series set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe and featuring the Space Marines.The writing is pretty good. If I had one criticism it's that the author overempahsizes the superhuman-ness of the Astartes (Space Marines). We get it. They are big, perfect specimens of martial virtue. You don't need to repeat it every third page.One other thing I noted in reading these books (I am on the second now) is there is an inherent contradiction. The Space Marines are on a secular Crusade throughout the Galaxy to bring the light of scientific truth in the name of the Emperor. Yet, the Emperor is immortal and the Astartes are basically gods or demi-gods. There are some 12 or 14 books in the series. I'll be interested to see if this is addressed at some point.If you like future military sci-fi, lots of violence in a dark and gritty setting, you'd probably like this."
5,Excellent introduction to the 40k universe,I think Warhammer 40k is one of the coolest SF properties out there. Lord of the rings in space essentially.This was a great book. The performance by the narrator was incredible!
4,Great start to the Horus Heresy,"Many of the novels that you will find from the Black Library/Games Workshop don't have much character story to them. The prevailing thought being- ACTION and more ACTION! And that is were this one differs. Dan Abnett isn't afraid of getting inside a character's head and letting you get to know him, and I for one like the character of Garviel Loken of the Luna Wolves. It is through his eyes that most of the story is seen. The story itself takes place in the 30th millenia during the founding of the Imperium of a Man. Fleets of armies are spreading out through the galaxy to claim systems in the name of the Emperor with the Space Marines at the forefront of the fight. Those of us familiar with the Warhammer 40K mythos know what's to come, but it's nice to get a little more detail."
1,Deffective,The hard drive did not work. My computer department said it is deffective. I would like a refund.
4,Lid support,"This lid support did exactly what I wanted it to do. The instructions were accurate and it operated correctly the first time. However, this is a lid support and NOT a lid closer. It holds the lid in an open position very well but does not close smoothly. DO NOT use this type of support to protect little fingers."
1,Avoid.,"I've recently evaluated several better books on this topic, and this one didn't make it into my spring term reading list. The book did little beyond skimming the basics of what can be found in any cinematography textbook, and had nothing new to say about 3D rendering or graphics production. Even the author's own sample images were crude and poorly lit.For a much better choice, consider getting ""Digital Lighting & Rendering"" by Jeremy Birn. Birn's new book is an amazing resource for any 3D artist, and I reviewed it on amazon with 5 stars.Alternately, you might just pick up a first-rate book on lighting for cinematography, such as ""The Technique of Lighting for Television and Film"" by Gerald Millerson or ""Matters of Light & Depth"" by Ross Lowell (although these cimematography books don't cover any techniques that are unique to digital graphics production.)"

4,Pink Floyd Pulse,It's not Delicate Sound of Thunder But it's good Pink Floyd. And it comes with a picture book.
5,Pulse- Pink Floyd,"I usually don't care much for recordings of live performances, but this is an exception. Not as structured as a studio recording, it's free and flowing music. Love it!"
1,what pulse?,"The cover is impressive in a fancy, slick way. The music is as limp as it could possibly be. Note-for-note performances of 'Dark Side' and stuff from 'Division Bell' and 'Momentary Lapse' do the originals whatever justice they deserve; Floyd had been leaving little to the imagination when playing these songs their whole career, so this CD should come as no surprise. But that doesn't let it off the hook. Don't waste your time, money or patience on it."
3,Is this still Pink Floyd?,"No doubt, Pink Floyd can pull off one hell of a rock concert, and I've only seen them on video! Their songs are great and the laser lights show is unmatched by any other band. Listening to their live album 'Pulse', I couldn't help but wonder if this is still the real Pink Floyd. It makes no sense to release a live album where the songs sound exactly the same as they do on the studio album. Listen to The Who or the Greatful Dead; their live songs are much more original and interesting then their studio songs. They offer something new and refreshing. No reason to buy a live album if it sounds exactly like the studio stuff, unless one likes to hear the croud cheer in the background.I guess ""Pink Floyd"" was trying to make a few extra bucks from the songs and ideas of Roger Waters. It seems like ""Pink Floyd"" accomplished at that goal."
2,the song is over,great dark side of the moon performance? its a historic re-enactment of a pink floyd concert with an army of players.
1,Why would anyone with any sense buy this?,"The creatively and (by this point) morally bankrupt Pink Floyd stagger ahead. With the black light poster market effectively cornered by them and Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd have, as of 2000, released three live albums in the past twelve years. Three of their last five records have been live albums. I suppose if you want yet another version of Run Like Hell to go with the other four (The Wall, Delicate Sound of Thunder, Is There Anybody Out There, and the new DVD of The Wall), go ahead."
1,Pink Floyd??,"It's hard to say that the Pink Floyd, talking about the original concept, died in 1968, when Roger ""Syd"" Barrett left the band. Gilmour, and his lucrative company, still insists denigrating the name with a cold corporate ""rock"". Forget Pulse, buy ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn""!"
1,This is not Pink Floyd. Booooooooooooring,The first 1 is bad. What have you done here David?????Dont f... with the Pink Floyd name. This is not Pink Floyd.
4,welcome to the...Usuall,"There are many things I like about this album, and many things I do not. The sound quality and effects, compared to ""Delicate Sound Of Thunder"", are fantastic. If you are looking for identical renditions of Floyd's best look elsewhere (good luck). I doubt they played ""Intersteller Overdrive"" the same way twice. the version of ""Dark side"" Is very moving and i love Dave's comment at the end. The only problem that I have is the song choice. I know for a fact that they played ""Welcome To The Machine"" and ""Have A Cigar"" during the tour, so why did'nt they include those songs on the CD. I really didn't need new versions of Sorrow"" or ""Learning To Fly"". The playing , however, is excellent and the new versions of ""Astronomy Domine""and ""Hey you"" (Can you tell it's not roger at the end) Are better than the originals. Pink floyd are not, and should not, be limited to sound patterns and should be given the opportunity to expand the songs beyond how we ""hear"" them. They do on ""Pulse""."
4,Don't buy if you have the original Dark Side Of The Moon,"It is a very good album, but not necessarily equal. The first CD starts with Shine on you Crazy Diamond, one of their best songs. Then you can skip to the tenth song and eleveth song, High Hopes and Another brick in the wall(Part 2), because between the second ans ninth song, the only good moments are only Learning to fly and Hey You. The rest is just about the same as on Division Bell except with some clapping and cheering, all in all, not totally what you could expect.However the second CD is very strong, only because it is powered by the ever great Dark Side of the Moon. The quality of the original songs makes it almost impossible to dislike this live version, but you cannot compare it to the original version, it doesn't have the power that it once had."
4,GREAT CONCERT RECORDINGS,"I'll keep this review short and simple. If you like/love Pink Floyd, then you probably like/love Dark Side, and Pink Floyd is great in concert (at least I think so), so to put those together is enough to buy Pulse on its own. But Pulse offers so much more than that, with other great concert recordings. Pick it up if you enjoy hearing them live (and if you like them live, you really should get all of their live albums)."
2,Ouch!!!!,"Yeah It hurts to even contemplate Floyd without Waters. This album is everything Waters and Syd Barrett were always against... Corporate Rock!Very much a nostalgia trip for the yuppy types and baby boomers. The novelty of the Dark Side set wears off pretty soon and ""Us and them"" is the only memorable effort.Gilmour's playing still stands out, but very little else does on this tired sounding effort."
2,This reunion thing sucks,"Sad to hear Pink Floyd, without the brilliant artristic leadership of Roger Waters, not to mention Syd Barrett, releasing this clunker after so many great albums. Who needs another live version of DSOTM? _I_ can't see any reason to buy this exorbitantly costly set except for the booklet, and even then it's cheaper just to buy the PULSE video!Don't be fooled into buying this CD."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this collection. I bought Pulse right after I saw Floyd in concert, and every time I listen to it I am taken back to the show with remarkable clarity. Although The Wall will always be my favorite Floyd album, Pulse comes in a close second for pure enjoyment. Its also great driving music."
2,"Why, why WHY????","This is a competent rip off!! All the songs sound ok, but there's so many songs here that also feature on ""Delicate sound of Thunder""!!!!!! Talk about a waste of cash. Musicians should no better than to insult there fans with efforts like this. At least when McCartney realeased ""Tripping the Live fantastic"" and ""Paul is Live"" within 4 years of each other - there was only 1 song that featured on both albums. With ""Pulse"" and ""Delicate Sound.."" there's LOADS!! (And they don't sound any better or worse either!) You'd think that 'Gilmour Floyd' would at least have the decency to include some earlier classics that WEREN'T on DSOT, but no! Infact NO thought and desire to create something that the fans actually want has gone into this one! I'm tempted to give it 1 star as a matter of principal - but the songs aren't bad enough for that. Do yourself a favour - avoid this....."
2,Pink Floyd turned Kitschy,"This album lacks more than just energy, it lacks that surrealisism that we attracted Pink Floyd fans in the first place. The music itself is technically well played but the vocals are, at best, flat and at times downright pathetic. With hokey emphasis on specific words that remind me of how perhaps a fourteen year old may sing these songs. Perhaps it is just me, but the original surreal quality of Pink I always stemmed from the almost ""matter of fact"" way Waters sang songs like Run like hell. This album places almost juvenile over emphasis on thier lyrics that destroys the surrealistic style of the original music. Pink Floyd fans of all types will find this album just plain lacking."
5,great product,I am absolutely pleased with your product the de livery was on time and I enjoyed it to the fullest
4,Pulse: Audio CD,"I do not share the views expressed here about the outstanding quality of this audio disc. The DVD is a truly remarkable recording both audio and video. This audio disc are from different concerts captured in the DVD. I am also disappointed they dropped 'Take It Back' from the audio set. The biggest fault of this disc is the sound seems ""remote"", the recording especially the vocals sound as if came from speakers and not 'directly', as if you're listening to the concert next door. Nevertheless Gilmour's leadership, similar to Phil Collins with Genesis, has allowed us to have these fine documents (Division Bell & Pulse live discs) that mark the end of a truly great band."
5,Fantastic !!!,"well I've been twice on concert during 1994 tour and whole month after the second concert I wasn't able to think about anythink else but the concert. It is by far the BEST show on Earth. Other bands don't come even close. If I would have to imagine an alien space ship that would be Pink Floyd stage. It is really out of this world. This CD reminds me of those days. The quality of sound is unbeliveable, just not usuall for live stuff, but that is Pink Floyd. Always the BEST. Best band of Past and Present. I just hope there will be ONE MORE album & tour. It has to be!!"
3,Remembering the good times,"Pulse- A two cd album with some of pink floyd's greatest hits. It covers all of darkside of the moon, and some of the great songs off the wall such as comfortably numb, hey you, and others. When Roger Waters(bassist, songwriter) left, it stuck a splinter in the floyd's gut. But David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright prevailed and went on tour in 87 and 94 and released some new albums. Love it or hate it. Its either a wonderful comeback, or the mark of a fading star."
3,"It wasn't so great, but I am new to Pink Floyd music.","This was my first Pink Floyd CD, and I didn't think it was very outstanding. To me the songs sounded generic, with a few great ones mixed in. The best part for me was the exquisite cover art. It looked really awesome. This probably is a good Pink Floyd CD, but not good for a 1st time buyer."
4,some sound better,This is a very good album to have ifyou are not a PF freak and want a greatest hits album. Comfortably Numb andShine on...sound better than the originals to me.
5,Floyd Forever,"Even without Mr. Waters, this legendary band still puts on the greatest show on earth. If you want to hear an incredible jam version of 'comfortably numb' including an apocalyptic guitar solo that will haunt and enchant, by all means get this album. These guys are masters atproducing live albums. nuff said, just listen."
4,Good Commercial Rendentions,"A very good live act of all the Pink Floyd favourites, and others that I hadn't heard before. The full Dark Side of the Moon on Disc 2 was great, and the encore of ""Wish You Were Here"" still brings a smile to my face as I hear everyone sing along in the background. I must say that ""Run Like Hell"" is very good on this recording with a great intro. Also, I believe that ""Sorrow"" on the first disc, is much better than it originally appeared on ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"" a Pink Floyd album I barely play any more."
4,El Mejor Disco en Vivo de La Historia,"Sin dudar mucho este disco es la mejro opcion para la gente ""nueva"" en el planeta Floyd, te mustra una coleccion de exitos de la banda desde los inicios, hasta los 90s, si faltan muchas canciones, si no esta roger waters, pero el disco es muy agradable y ademas interptretan el DARK SIDE OF THE MOON completo !Buen Disco.....El Mejor En vivo jamas grabado, impecable, limpio y ejecutado muchas veces, mejor que las versiones en estudio"
1,Money!!,"If it has not Roger Waters, it's not Pink Floyd. Simple as that. Imagine QUEEN without Fred Mercury (the band quit). Imagine IRon Maiden without Steev Harris. Imagine Led Zeppelin without John Bonham, WHO without Pete Towshend, MEtallica without JAmes Hetfield, imagine AC/DC without Angus and Malcolm Young. No way.OF course GIlmour, Wright and Mason are great musicians. But the approach here is toally wrong. The album has no soul. It was clearly designed to make some fast money. The army of session musicians damage the identity of the songs. TO listen DARK SIDE OF THE MOON lost amongst crowd noise is not a pleasant experience.THis album was never meant to be. But it happened, and damaged once more the GIlmour's Floyd reputation."
1,A big fan of Pink Floyd,"This is not Pink Floyd. Why we need a new version of Dark Side? Why listen to the new Pink Stuff? If you are a real Pink fan dont buy it. No more Gilmore, Gilmore no more.Buy ""In the flesh""The biggest fan of Pink Floyd i am 46 years old."
1,"Do you like Pink Floyd? If so, you dont want this album.","First of all, this isnt Pink Floyd. Unless you think Ringo, George, and 34 studio musicians are the Beatles, you should have a problem with a band calling themselves Pink Floyd without the genius and songwriter who created all of Pink Floyd's really great stuff.Secondly, this album brings nothing new from the last phony Pink Floyd concert album, A Delicate Sound Of Boredom. In fact, here is how to save yourself some money. Get Delicate Sound Of Boredom, then picture David Gilmour even fatter and balder than before and...wala...you have this album. This is nothing more than court-approved identity and song theft."
1,Big waste of time and money...,"Great idea: to listen to DARK SIDE OF THE MOON live, performed by another band, be it: without Roger Waters and with ""tons"" of extra session musicians!"
3,Pretty good album...,"Bought this before the Pulse video came out; that, I believe, is the best musical event ever captured on video.Unfortunately, the audio part of it, on the CDs, doesn't come alive the way the video does. It's a very good recording of a very good concert (with maybe the best recording ever of ""Money,""), but not quite as good as the ""Delicate Sound of Thunder"" CD, which has most of the same songs. I'd buy that one first. It's a masterpiece.For Pulse, buy the video, or wait til a real DVD is released."
4,"A time long past, a classic for eternity","I first purchased this CD upon it's initial release. (The Blinking Version) Over time the discs became too scratched and well listened to.I was fortunate to see them play this concert in the New Orleans Superdome, and i will testify to this day as that being the best concert in my life. Stunning audio, effects and lighting. Although the actual concert was nearly 4 hours long and i wish they could have provided every song played during the concert, i realize it may not have been very marketable.The VHS was missing songs, and the DVD disappointed me with even more songs missing from the actual concert performance. I would before I die hope to see a remastered full concert released on DVD or Blue-Ray."
4,When are they going to realese Pulse including One of these days in the CD format?,"It's such a shame that the CD format of Pulse doesn't have the song One of these days, wich is available in the cassette and DVD format. They should have to make a new release including this song in the CD format."
1,not much there,This book provides very little information even for a beginning dancer. Considering the lack of content it is much too pricey.
4,A Thrilling Adventure,"I htought this was an exciting book with excellent morals. Most parts of this amazingly exciting book left me wanting to keep reading the book. I liked this book becasue there was a mystery character and I wanted to keep reading to find out more about him. I also liked this book becasue it is a realistic event that could happen. I loved how through the book there was always an event that made me want to continue reading to find out what happens. A character that got my attention was Scout. She was a strong-willed and courageous girl who knew when to stand up for what is right. After all that she went through inb her life, she stood tall and proud and didn't let much get her down. Any type of audience should enjoy this book. It deals with many aspects on life and I recommend this book for everyone to read."
3,Hard to Read,It is hard to read becasue it has so many run on sentences adn fragments. You have to concentrate strictly on the book and have no distractions.
5,Very pleased,The book was in perfect condition. I dropped the class and had to return to vendor. No problem.
1,shocked at low quality,so much for as new condition!! The purchased book was scrawled in and underlined all over the place. I was very disappointed.
5,Buy it if you can,"I bought this book back in 1982. From what I have been told, Disney made the publisher take it off the market, so I was surprised to see it here. I have not seen better Disney designs anywhere, and if it comes back in stock, I would whole heartedly recommend it."
3,"Fox Searchlight Spotlight Series, Vol #1","This is a three disc compilation of releases by Fox Studio. Included in this Vol #1 series is Napoleon Dynamite, Little Miss Sunshine and Juno. Not too sure why this information could not have been added to the description by whoever input the initial but sketchy data. It helps to know what is contained in a multi-disc set so one can make an informed decision as to whether to purchase it or not. Or, as in this case, I already own two of the three discs. There are a total of four of these Fox Searchlight Spotlight Series being released, all about the same time. Vol #2 contains The Full Monty, Bend It Like Beckham and Waitress. Vol #3 contains Boys Don't Cry, Antwone Fisher and The Last King Of Scotland. Vol #4 contains Garden State, Sideways and Thank You For Smoking."
3,Eh.,"The llama's cute and stands up like it does in the picture, I just think it's a little on the small side when compared to what it's priced at."
4,About Right,"Blinside seemingly wanted to capture the rawness of their first two CD's, and they did so capably here, with a few signs of accomplished - but rugged - songwriting thrown in for good measure. Good stuff here, but fails to capture Silence's energy and About A Burning Fire's experimentation."
3,Blah,"I am a long time fan of Blindside. So, when I purchased this CD I had higher hopes for it. I have all the previous blindside albums and enjoy the change in style from album to album, but my favorite must be ""about a burning fire"". I have come to the conclusion that there are only 4 tracks on this cd worth listening to and I have listened to it several times. The CD gets old really fast, and this is my least favorite release that Blindside has put out. It's a cd that you will have to play only every once in a while to keep the songs from becoming stale. I was not impressed. However, it does deserve the 3 stars I gave because the songs that are good on this cd are some awesome songs by Blindside."
2,a bit lacking...,"Blindside is good, but this album dosent cut it. the melodies are weak, and the guitar work drags along though the album. Christian's vocals are great as always, but its nothing special. Blindside has done better defidently."
2,This is Blindside??!!,"I'll keep this short. This is NOT the Blindside you have been listening to since 1997. Silence was a slight departure from the norm, but this is ridiculous. Fans of their earlier albums need not even bother listening to samples."
1,EXCELLENT ALBUM. 5 STARS NOT 1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This should be 5 stars but for what ever reason it wouldn't give me the option to change it. When I first reviewed this album I gave it a horrible review. But since that time I've listened to it several times and I have had a total change of mind. This album is so emotionally charged. Its beautiful work of art. The lyrics are superb, and the music for the most part is awesome. Great album worth buying. And if by chance you don't like it at first, give it a chance to grow on you, you might just change your mind."
5,A Great Evolving Band,"Ever since I started listening to Blindside I noticed that all of their (now a total of 5) cd's are all somewhat different in sound, but they are all great. The band usually tends to have a theme to each cd, which is awesome. Although the theme to this cd is more ""out there"" then the rest, it is EXTREMELY creative and very catchy after you listen to it your second time. I have seen them play live, and for those of you who say that their Silence and About A Burning Fire are the only good cd's out there, you would completely change your mind if you heard any of their old songs, or these brand new songs live. If you hve liked Blindside in the past, listen to this new album 3 or 4 times and I will be insulted if you don't like it!We are to follow"
4,give it time,"I bought this album in it's first week out back in aug, 05'.I really liked it then and listened to it all the time for the next month. Then I kinda shelved it for a while. I saw them live in oct, 05' and picked it back up for a couple weeks and shelved it again. Then, in jan, 06' I put in the ol' player and I can't get enough. This album is a ""grower"" for me. But once it grew on me I loved it."
4,"Missing the ""grit"" of the originals, but still interesting","While this collection of remixes by various mix masters is energetic, it does seem to lack the power that made Salt-n-Pepa one of the most distinctly original trios to grace popular music. In a field dominated by male rappers, the group had a string of successful chart toppers in the early late 80's and early 90's. Their ""greatest"" are here in significantly altered and revamped forms and worthy of a trip down memory lane."
5,Hubby loved this filter purchase,"I got it for husband's bmw. He says it fit well, works fine and was a great price. He would buy it again."
2,does not fit to 2002 BMW 330cic and 2004 BMW X3 3.0i,"Although it says it fits to both my vehicles, it does NOT fit at all. I kept them in their boxes couple of months until I was ready to install. But I missed the return window and expired. I would not recommend this filter to anybody."
5,Cross Cultural Adoption,I really enjoyed this book. Its a quick read and very helpful. I bought 3 more copies to give to friends. I hope this helps.
4,adoption resource,A great book for friends and family of individuals adopting internationally. A quick and easy read that stresses the importance of using appropriate adoption language.
4,Nice but no Confessions,Nicely written but like all books about Crowley it misses the romantic feel that the Confessions of Aleister Crowley gives.The whole point is to read and study Crowley by Crowley.
1,First Impressions,"Seems to be not a few ardent fans of Mr. Crowley reviewing this work, which is claimed to be thorough and professional. Even so, Chistopher S. Hyatt's actual review printed on the back cover is worth noting:""Dr. Kaczynski ... is on the bleeding edge of academic research on occultism""Now, after a recommendation like that, who wouldn't be intrigued?LOL"
5,Gut Symmetries is Winterson at the top of her form.,"Winterson's writing is so powerful that when I read her books,I have a pencil and a pad of yellow ""stick-ums"" at my side, so I canmark particularly moving or powerful passages. My copy of Gut Symmetries is now full of yellow tags.Winterson is one of the few writers I know who can repeatedly effectively convey complex thoughts and emotions in simple, witty, powerful language. Whenever I re-read the sections of Gut Symmetries I have marked, I am awed by Winterson's ability with the language.If you have enjoyed other books by Winterson, you will enjoy this one. If you have not read Winterson before, you might try reading The Passion first. The Passion has a stronger/easier to follow story line."
1,"Perhaps the worst supposedly ""literary"" work I've read!","I was a bit suspicious of this book after reading the back, considering how familiar some of its ideas sounded. (Anyone ever hear of Tom Stoppard?) But I thought I'd give it a shot. I should have sooner shot myself in the head! This is nothing more than a lot of mixed scientific metaphors (and let's hasten to add that Winterson's apparent understanding of much of the science is spotty -- all the worse for her characters, who are supposed to be rather gifted here) in a soap opera-like love triangle (though with MORE melodrama and histronics) rendered in a sophmorically prolix prose style, part of which is to include at least one homily per paragraph. The praise Winterson has received truly bespeaks the dearth of anything truly literary in today's publishing world. Anyway, if both Jesus and Nabokov came from the dead and begged me to read anything else by Winterson, I would not only refuse but also slap both of their faces as hard as I was able."
2,what is this book?,"OK, it's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember almost feeling tingles when I heard about it...I too, have thought that physics is the meaning of life, and I ADORE any considerate mediation on relationships, but alas this book was horrible. It may have been a huge letdown because I was looking forward to it so much as I LOVED ""The Passion"" and ""Written on the Body"". I found this book to be entirely tooooo tangental and poetic words leading into boxed up nothings."
4,"Now ""Random Word of the Day""","Jesse Sheidlower has moved on, from Random House to OED. The information given above is out of date. Jesse no longer writes the Word of the Day. It is now called the Random House Word of the Day. You can still visit the site, and it's still good. (I know everyone involved, so I have to say this.) There was an October 1999 _NY Times_ Circuits section article on this and other Word-of-the-Day sites. The information I've mentioned above was included in a correction."
3,"A Fine, But Flawed, Study Of Learning Useful Language","Bruner's book will offer much information on how children should learn language so as to promote their ownership of it as a communcable tool even though he fails to argue using multicultural eyes.Toward the end, he begins to get bogged down in complex theories and academic langauge thus making the book (like many of his books) inaccessible to classroom teachers.He apparently wrote the first half to all professionals while writing the rest of the book to a higher education audience."
1,not much help,This book is unfortunately limited in scope (to domestic airports) and out of date; things change fast as travelers are spending more time at airports. Not very useful any more.
3,An interesting book by a lovely lady,"I found _Stuck at the Airport_ to be a very interesting book. As an infrequent airline traveler, I am usually too engrossed in looking around to be really bored, but it still had some very interesting suggestions."
5,A Well-Organized Reference,"This book helps me understand, in more depth, medical conditions experienced by me, or my family. Even issues about pregnancy and menopause are covered in useful fashion. It's also a handy reference for times when I've forgotten my doctor's exact instructions. I would not recommend using it to self-diagnose, as there are many conditions that can only be accurately diagnosed by lab tests, or someone skilled in the field. It has, however, helped us determine when to seek a physician's advice, which kept minor illnesses from becoming serious ones."
4,good,"It is a very good and useful book. It has everything you'd want in it plus more. It includes the signs and syptoms, what you can do to treat the problem, etc. I just wish that it had pictures in it so you could have more to go off of."
4,Great!!,"ICRC book is excellent! This book is well written and covers most of the material. I also used the Sybex CCNA book by Todd Lammle, also a great book, which covered details that ICRC did not cover and vice versa. I did not crack open the internetworking technologies handbook to pass my CCNA exam."
5,Go for it!,"Thus far the whole Amazon Market place from A-Z has been great. The entire experince from finding the correct material to ordering it through via: e-commerce was wonderful. I received my Cisco prep exam within a couple of days. Chris was the gentlemen that I purchased the set from. I e-mail him previuosly to get this input before actually purchasing the material. The set is in really good condition no markings at all. I highly recommend ""Amazon's Marketplace""."
5,All you need for study and reference.,"This package has everything that is needed to study for the CCNA 2.0 exam. And it doesn't stop there, the books are excellent source of reference materials for other Cisco curriculum and for the real world applications too."
4,Life performance rules with these guys,Actually just seen these guys life on stage in a not so big bar. I was amazed by the shear volume they produce with just a real simple setup. The drummer wasn't even playing on his own kit. And it wasn't a Ludwig he was playing on either. I tell you now that you are not getting the same thing on CD as what they will give you on stage. Listened to a few songs of their repetoire with songs from '94 as well. Songs like Mile High and Windows Jam are awesome. You really get shaken through the bone by that massive reverbed base guitar. I almost would say that it could be music from another planet. Really freaky and almost frightning.A definite buyer for the Stonerock fans amongst us.
3,Satisfying 3rd part of Fortress series,Fortress of Owls is a very satisfying work. It's stronger than part 2 which left me with the feeling that we needed a couple more chapters to finish it off. I especially like the conniving over needlework. Who says you need swords to draw blood? It gets a bit weak in parts - and very confusing - but there is enough to pull you along. The book is a keeper and now comes the long wait for Fortress of Dragons!
5,What does it mean to trust?,"I love the way CJ explores multiple themes, and one of them in this series, I think, is the nature of trust. This relates to the more obvious topic of religion and spirituality. (Religion takes a knocking, but I'll forgive her that because she's trying to be honest.) I wonder about Tristen as Christ. A virgin birth, so to speak. One who learns of his special mission - to save. I'm betting Dragons involves a crucifixion. Is the grey space - prayer? I'm also thinking of the Tempest, in which Prospero must relinquish his power (Ariel) and embrace his shadow (Caliban, whom, at the close of the play, he invites into his home.) Is Tristen's shadow - Orien??? What a pregnant thought, even if the pregnant one is her twin sister."
2,The series is getting worse,"Truthfully, Owls was a bit more interesting than Eagles, but then, it could hardly help but be. I persevered through 400 pages of Eagles because I'd loved Fortress in the Eye of Time so much. Surely Owls would be the good strong cup of coffee this series needed. It wasn't. Owls was a somewhat faster and had a little more action than Eagles. It probably would have merited a higher rating from me if it hadn't followed the yawn-fest that was Eagles. Eagles and Owls could easily have been combined into one smaller book than either is separately, and with no loss to the continuing story. So disappointing."
4,Excuisitely detailed and developed plot and characters,"I will begin by stating that while book can stand on its own, but I do not recommend reading it out of context with the rest of the series.I greatly enjoyed the development of the Tristen in this book. There is little external 'action', most of it is internal -- we see him struggling with the Other, in this case, his former self/identity. In the first book, the Other was Mauryl's enemy. In the second book, the Other was Cefwyn's political opponents. But in this book, the Other is Tristen himself.In some ways, Tristen is like Robert Jordan's Rand al'Thor, though with less internal conflict, and certainly a good deal more originality.CJ Cherryh is one of the most versatile authors out there. She writes evocative fantasy and disturbing hard-core sci-fi with equal credibility. ""Fortress of Owls"" is of the same high caliber I have come to expect of all her works."
3,A Continuing Saga,"This book is definitely one in a series. The whole book is a building of tension and hints at an uncertain climax (which may come in the next book (?)). While there is not much ""action"" per se, the book gives great insight into Tristen's rapidly-developing character, kingdom politics, and the state of the world in general. Overall I do recommend this book, but at times it is slow and tedious. However, it is a must read and sets the stage for intrigue to come."
3,"Too much talk, too little action","I always liked the fact that many of Cherryh's fantasy books were 'chamber pieces' rather than grand epics. This book, however, is a bit too minimal. The third in the saga, it is but an overlong prologue for the book to come. It's not a bad book, it's just that so little happens - and when there is some action, it's offstage and only related in talks between characters. On the positive side, Cherryh deals in detail with the politics of governing and warfare, and their effects on everyday people. Also there's some genuine humour to be found in the way that the bickering at the royal court is described. The story picks up at the end, and nicely sets the stage for the next book, which hopefully will then deliver the goods."
2,Needed a little excitement,"There is such a thing as going into a little too much detail and this book crossed that line. One of the other readers managed to write a critical review and make it sound like a praise. I, however, do not posses that talent.I don't usually mind political intrigue or things of that nature but they need to be balanced with some actually interesting events.(There is only so much introspection I can stand before becoming bored out of my mind.) The character development was, of course, interseting (up to a point) but frankly I don't think Cherryh should have bothered writing this book. Mixed it in with the next one maybe but as it stands I am glad I didn't buy it."
1,Fortress of Yawns,18 pages of italicized 'history' sets the tone for this boring book. Pretentious writing and slow pacing make finishing this book a real chore. I expected much better from C.J. Cherryh. Definitely a book destined to clog used paperback stores.
4,Everything Here is Crystal Clear,"While NDR remains one of the topmost orchestras in the world for over a century, Wand is so crystal clear here with everything: Each motif, each theme, each section of the orchestra, and even each note of each and every instrument...How does he make it happen? You just have to listen with your own ear to believe..."
5,I Love It!,"The product is really Great.. I have very course thick woolly hair, that has a hard time holding press/ flatirons. However, After using only the conditioner and then Cold water washing my hair. I then blow drying and flatiron using only heat protected spray. And absolutely loved it....This was the first time in my life I had ever flat iron my hair without grease or oil. And I love the way it feel and Look!"
5,Miracle product ;-),"I was about pulling my hair out to help my son write at least somewhat legibly and to write more than one sentence at a time. My son's new teacher had started sending home these writing activity cards for homework, and they are the only homework he really likes doing. I bought the deck, and he actually asks to do the activities -- unnnn-believable. Totally recommended."
4,Great girl group w/ a upbeat bubble gum sound,This CD is great! The songs are upbeat and squeeky clean bubble gum. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Spice Girls.
3,Mystery Vance,"The Man in the Cage is one of Jack Vance's non sf works. It's a murder mystery/thriller set in North Africa, and it's strength comes from strong main character, witty observations of an expat US community, and Vance's usual brilliance at visual desciption. The murder and its solution is superbly plotted."
3,NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED,"My son wanted an inflatible sleeping bag with a boy theme, similar to his sister's My Little Pony bag - this is fine for an air mattress, but it is NOT a slumber bag. We should have looked closer at the description...It came up on a list with a Power Ranger inflatible sleeping bag and we didn't notice that this does not have a sleeping bag at all.That being said, it seemed pretty durable (until the kids used it as a punching bag and it deflated!)"
1,Errors - even in the errata!,"I cannot recommend this book. I think it's another one of those `get it to market' quickly ones, and I'm disappointed about that since I own several of the author's other books. I specifically purchased this for the lace edged gloves and a hat pattern. Both patterns have errors, and the errata I found online (for both), which was supposedly provided by the author, also has errors - different ones! For example: the errata reads: Cast on 5 sts, cast off 2 sts slip st on RH needle back onto LH needle (3 sts now on LH needle) rep from * to * until 36 sts on needle, cast on 1 sts. (67 sts) This has to be wrong! So with errors in both the original and ""edited"" versions, one can't even determine what to try to fix.I just purchased this book recently, so it's getting returned. I noticed that some of the really positive reviews sound like the individuals had not yet made anything from the book at the time they rated it."
1,Poor Instructions on the One Pattern I liked,"I paid full price for this book at a knitting store and really regret it. There was only one pattern I really liked, and there must be errors in it because it doesn't knit up well at all. The photo of the hat is attractive - brown and in a moss stitch. It appears to have a double layer at the bottom, but it is really a single layer, so it isn't even a very warm hat. There were too many increases listed for the bottom and too few for the crown. I would never buy a book from this author again."
2,Not that great of a book in terms of comprehensiveness,"There aren't that many patterns overall, and there are too many with adornments. I only found about a handful, like three or four that I would want to make."
4,Taking pictures in nightclubs,i find this camara very good for taking photos in dark places such as outdoor dance events and nightclubs.
3,Good Beginners Camera,"This is probably a good beginners camera, but no where near 35 mm quality. Even up close. pictures came out, out of focus when using zoom and flash."
3,Not the Greatest,"""How English Works"" is an ok exercise and grammar book, though not without some points that are problematic.The explanations for different grammar points and structures are well written and fairly easy to grasp for the most part. The book covers a large range of grammar points, and this is definitely something in favour of it. However, so do other books of a similar type.The exercises are very limited, giving only a small amount of practice for each structure and form. In some cases, a lot was sacrificed for the sake of some excellent presentation, such as full colour pictures and so on. This lack of depth in the exercises means that students may have to supplement this book with another.Overall, the ""How English Works"" is not a bad book, but I think there are better out there. This book would be good as a supplement to other books, or perhaps for a reference for students. However, I would not recommend it above all others."
3,Ordered for a friend,She was looking for a certain folk tales to use in a story time. I do not know if it was what she was looking for.Letta Meinen
3,Bongos,"Drum heads appeared to be used, some general wear on bongos thought we were getting a ""new"" item. Nice set, but would have been nicer if new. Price was attractive, now I know why."
3,Great set of bongos,"I am very happy with the set of bongos I have received. The only reason I gave a rating of 4 out of 5 is because I did not receive the tuning key that was advertised to accompany the bongos (no matter-I have one) and I was unaware the bongos had been shipped when they arrived. Fortunately, someone was available on location so the box was not outside for a long period of time. That being said, I am very happy with the short time span between ordering the product and the arrival. Thanks very much."
3,Eh...it was okay,The bongo were okay but the heads we old and had to be replaced. It was worth the price if you don't mind bying new head. Next time i'll just spend extra on a name brand.
4,Tad heavy,Got this for my wedding and has been in my cupboard since. Its been close to 5 months and I decided to wear it on the 1st of Jan 2008 and I was in for a big surprise. The watch still held the charge.
5,THE BEST,I have spent a lot of money trying various brands of shapewear. The Lipo in a Box bodysuit is worth every penny. It is comfortable overall. It really smooths and holds in without feeling like an old fashion girdle. AND the gusseted opening actually allows one to use the bathroom without incident. (I know you know what I mean.)
1,Expensive and Disappointing,"I bought two of these products. They are very comfortable, but definitely not ""firm control"". They do smooth out the bulges a bit. Also, the ""convenience opening"" is far too small to be of any use. I have to undress to use the restroom. Sadly, During the second washing one of the underwires came out completely. It's a lot of money, and not nearly as great as I thought it would be. Long story short, I'm out almost $100 for an item I was able to wear twice."
4,Bluegrass deodorant,"Since I started going thru the ""change"" of life I have been extremely frustrated with finding an effective deodorant. Until now. I love bluegrass. Not only does it fight against odor but it smells nice too. The dispenser leaves a lil something to be desired tho."
5,Easier to Read Format,"""Contains all of the data found in the original abstract in an easier-to read format."" -American Demographics"
4,A great item to purchase,"I am very glad that I purchased this book it has really helped in my search for ancestors. I like having things in my hand to refer to, not just look at online. I guess I may be from the old school but with a book I can highlight important things and flag pages that are informative."
3,Reference,"A reference book only - short on vital records - a good ""jumping off"" point for research into many royal family lines. A bit out dated, however a well intentioned look at multiple family lines."
4,Families Directly Descended from All the Royal ....,Was not aware that this was in fact the genealogy of a particular family and not of mine.. The more historical informarion I could have found in other material. It did however make informative reading.
2,Misleading title,This is about certain families only and is not a broadly researched book. And what work was done was done some time ago and is not reliable.
4,Great little iCam,"I have an older 23"" Apple Cinema Display that predates built-in cameras. I shopped around and found this one and I have not been disappointed. It was easy to install, easy to mount (I have it taped to the top of my monitor) and works like a charm. I use it with Skype, Facetime and to take headshots for social networking. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately priced and reliable i-cam."
2,A Dictionary of Words,"I can not comprehend how this book got published without a single symbol illustration. I was tempted to give it zero or only 1 star, but the text is good - very thorough. It is therefore useful if you know the glyph or symbol you're interested in, but is not a book of discovery and imagination.The layout and presentation is horrible - a small, very fat book with tiny print.Not as intellectually deep, but still very comprehensive and a lot more useful and usable, is Carl G. Liungman's Dictionary of Symbols. It has illustrations, groupings, big print and everything! Get it first, and if you then want to get way deep into the esoteric, maybe Chevalier is for you.Also, try symbols.com for a quick online reference. I find it pretty helpful, too."
3,Disappointed with Amazon,"While this is certainly an interesting reference tool, the book Amazon keeps in stock as 'The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols' is not the one pictured. The book that this page leads you to believe you are buying is quite a bit shorter, but actually gives illustrations of the symbols (I used to own a copy of it). The book that Amazon sells on this page is a fairly useful reference book, but lacks the imagery of the one pictured, which some buyers may be seeking."
1,not worth it,"This is a great book for obtaining a few interesting symbols. The really terrible part is that the author did just that. Collected a few symbols on which they had no information. It is like the book is written as ""here are a few really cool symbols!!! Aren't they just awesome?!"". No detail no history no research. Save the money. look elsewhere."
2,Bad publisher,"I saw this book in the Spanish translation, a real encyclopedia full of graphics, alkaline paper, and hardback. Amazon sells this one ....This version in English is austere, printed on newspaper bad quality paper- the ink stains fingers, the pages rip as you turn them.This ... quality does a disservice to the authors, who have spent their lives compending this fabulous work."
3,no visuals,I was hoping there would be visual matierals to supliment the content but there isn't. I would recommend finding a different symbols dictionary if you're looking for that kind of thing.
3,Mixed feelings on this...,"I bought this book as I felt myself reasonably conversant with networking technology and in need of a quick book to help fill any gaps in my knowledge - The book was some help, but I'm sure there are others out there that are better - I wouldn't call it a complete guide since it lightly touches every area of networking - If you know your networking stuff, then you wouldn't need this guide, on the otherhand, if you don't know its size might appear frightening, but it could prove of some use, perhaps complimenting some other book..."
1,Networking complete - in book review,"Well... i've just read the first topic and are now onto networking in the workplace and i don't think very highly of this book at all... statments like networks are here to replace floppy disks (sneakernets) could be misleading to newbies, in essence networks are here to communicate information quickly and efficitantly... i'll post a full review once i've finshed readly the book...""you get what you pay for"" and 30.00 for a technology book means you'll get $30.00 worth of information"
1,Wrong design,"Sadly, the design of the flag is wrong. It's got 21 stars instead of 19. On the true Indiana flag, the stars form a circle around the torch; the two stars on the edges at the top of this flag are not a part of the design. For comparison, check out [...]If you're looking for mistakes and rarities, however, there you go."
3,Why'd Didn't They Republish the 3rd Edition?,"Why they republished this edition when they might have republished the Second Revised Edition (by Graham and Charles McGolrick, originally published in 1964) beats me. The latter is unquestionably better,as it is more current, and contains more tips. Yet even the 1964 edition is pretty dated (there is no discussion of cash flow statement interpretation, for example, although Graham alludes to cashflow somewhat disparagingly in this later edition). One might argue that there is value in going back to the 1st edition of this small volume as one might go back to the 1st edition of Security Analysis. There are indeed nuggets in the 1st edition of Security Analysis which have been mysteriously removed from later editions. But that isn't true with The Interpretation of Financial Statements. If you can find a copy of the 1964 edition of this book, you will likely find it more useful than the original."
2,Outdated language and examples,"Value investing is timeless and Ben Graham is the master of it, but that does not make his books necessarily worthy of reading. Understanding companies' financial statements is imperative for any serious investor but I do not recommend this book as your main source. This was written in 1937. The examples (mainly railroads and utilities) are out dated. Cash flow statements were not even used at that time. GAAP did not exist. If you are interested in better understanding of financial statements, I recommend the following three books instead:Reading Financial Reports For Dummies by Lita EpsteinHow to Read a Financial Report by John TracyFinancial Statements by Thomas Ittelson"
3,Quick Accounting Review,This short book is a quick and straightforward review of balance sheet and income statement line items. The cash flow statement is not directly addressed. Each chapter is about two to three pages.
3,Too short.,"This book is a brief summary of how to interpret financial statements. While the book has some good points my main complaint is with its brevity. It also appears this book is best suited for those already familiar with the subject, perhaps as a short reminder of what to look for in financial statements.I think this book would have been better if it had been expanded somewhat and possibly also if it had been included in either the book Security Analysis or in The Intelligent Investor. You should also note that this book is from 1937 and both accounting terminology and standards have changed somewhat since then, as have the types of businesses that exist.If you are looking for a book that explains accounting really well at a beginner's level then I would instead recommend: Financial Statements by Thomas Ittelson. If you are looking for a book that reviews in more depth the interpretation of financial statements I would recommend: Analysis for Financial Management by Robert Higgins."
2,A classic,Yes it is a classic but it is also old and outdated - this is what you are buying when you buy this book. A new book entitle Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements is far more timely book.
4,(None),"A short, concise explanation of financial statements by one of the all-time great investors/teachers - Ben Graham. A bit dated today but much of it is still relevant. Since Graham occasionally assumes a knowledge of investing which may be somewhat beyond the novice investor, HOWEVER, if you can't follow the book you're NOT ready to begin investing (go back and get a simpler text until you can understand ALL of this short work - THEN you're ready to put good money at hazard in the Financial Markets)."
2,Horribly Out-of-date,Price to cash flowThis book was written at a time when railroads were the major industry in the US! Intangibles and more sophisticated accounting measures simply did not exist. Get a book written from at least the 1990's onward.
1,Simple content that charges Huge amount,"The book's content doesn't give any valuable information at all. What's inside can be found on most other financial and investment books. Furthermore, the cost is way way too high. I feel ripped off!My worst buy at the moment!!"
3,Fast Shipping / Poor Alignment / Looks Good,"Purchased this item for a 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT. Got the shipment 2 days ahead of time! Great service!!! However the reason for just 3 stars -->> The cover does not sit flush with light and finding alignment to secure was difficult due to the machined holes don't exactly line up to the factory light. After fiddling with it for awhile, I was able to get the provided longer screws in place but on slight angle in each hole. Kinda iffy, but it worked. Looking at it from the rear its pretty good looking. Side view, well again, its not flush and screws are visible. Oh, and its not quite level either. If you look careful enough from the rear, you see it drops down to the right slightly. Overall, besides the nit picking I'm doing, for an average Joe this should ok. But if your meticulous like myself, this $30 item may not be the one for your $35,000 truck. Hope this helps.JR in CT"
4,"Escape From Tenopia, (Choose your own adventure)","The style of this book makes a gem if you can find it. The regular choose your own adventure style has about 100- 180 pgs. and 10- 12 endings, some good (happily ever after) and some bad (you were eaten, thanks for playing) in regular choose your own adventure, you may only visit a page once and then make a choice out of two to three different pages. The book by Edward packard, however lets you visit a place more than once in your journey [each page represents a different place on the island of tenopia] when you reach a page it asks whether or not you have been here before. this allows you to ask people you met last time for any more information that they have learned in the time you were gone. This book has a great story-line and ends with you finding your way to the next book in the series."
3,Beware--Wrong Size!,"While these clamps seem like good quality, the ACTUAL size is 1/2 inch and NOT 1-1/2 inch as listed. The product packaging does however show the correct size."
4,great but not as good as the first!,"out of all the neon genisis mangas, I like the third the best but you can't get to the third without the second. this was a realy cool book though. there was fewer battle scenes than in the first book but they were still great. shinji is more rebelius in this one, he refuses to follow misatos orders and fights the angel to the end. some cool new weponds and charactors await you as shinji takes on another dreaded angel and an angry misato afterwards. the art is incredibale and the characters are still great in NEON GENESIS EVANGELION vol.2 (p.s. the only reason I gave it 4 stars is beacause they don't have a 4 and a half star rating.)"
5,Lots of thumbs up,Neon Genesis Evangelion is far most the best manga/anime i have ever seen and read. The plot of the story gives it real life and deals with very much sci-fi and mecha. It also revolves around a world where our world could probably end up being. The characters are very vivid and interesting and my knowledge of Eva is far more than what i am writing here. If anyone would like to email feel free to!
1,You sit on a throne of Lies...,I completely love the fact that the display picture of the comic is the original cover which is a RED/ORANGE cover which collector value is currently $60 yet I was shipped out a GOLD reprint cover which is worth a grand spanking total of $4 and is pretty much worthless to me. It sure would have been nice if it would have specified WHEN I BOUGHT THE COMIC that I was purchasing a gold cover reprint instead of the original otherwise I would have bought the right one. Thanks ever so much for nothing.
5,Grandaughter Loved It!,"My 6 yr old grandaughter just loves this game! She is always saying she wants to be a Vet, so I thought this would be a fit for her! And it was! She finds it fun and likes to play like she is a real vet."
3,Halloween Veteranian,"This is the first Halloween costume my daughter has worn, voluntarily. Since the jacket goes over regular clothes there is no ""itch factor"", a big complaint of 3 & 4-year-olds. She looked adorable."
2,"Not if you've had the regular version, otherwise okay","I'm a huge Stephen's fan but I'd only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa. Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought I'd try the fat-free variety. DON'T! :) Okay, if you aren't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it. It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa. I'm going back to the good stuff."
2,TERMINATOR,"Have used this mixer a couple times,not thrilled with it.Dispences liquid very slowly after the first couple uses.Seems like its not working right. Ran engine for fifteen min.did not empty cup.."
5,No Glasses needed,This is a great pump. I was tired of the other pumps I had purchased before as they were difficult to use or the metal was cheap...not this pump. It is well built and easy to use. I don't even need to wear my glasses to read the gauge.
4,Solid,"Solid, and pumps with ease. Love the way it looks and the gauge looks to be accurate. I am not sure how long it will last as i havent used it much, but its been good so far"
1,Poor quality parts - won't last,"Received one of these pumps as a gift. Within one year, the gauge read 20 lbs too high (read 20 lbs. with no pressure) and the plastic piece that holds the handle to the pump broke at one of the hinge points. The pump was well taken care of and never abused. Topeak no longer has a contact number and won't respond to emails about buying replacement parts. These pumps are overpriced and are throw-aways when something breaks."
3,Wears out too fast,"Decent pump when it is working, but the rubber in the Smarthead wears out way too fast. It started leaking air after a few months of use and went downhill from there. It now will not inflate a presta at all. I have to put a schrader to presta adapter on to get air in and will rebuild the head shortly. Also, the pump does not push a ton of volume per stroke, so be prepared to keep pumping for quite a while to get over 100psi.Overall disappointed, but since I can rebuild the head for a lot cheaper than buying a new pump, I'll do that until I get completely frustrated and give this one away. I leave this Topeak at home and only use it when I'm tinkering at the house. I travel with a different floor pump and I would not rely on this Topeak at the races.I will not buy another Topeak pump in the future."
5,JoeBlow Pro for the long haul,"After several years my JoeBlow Pro's gauge stopped working. I thought I'd just get another pump. I tried an SKS Rennkompressor that I disliked so much I sent it back. After reading reviews and noting what problems people had with some of the other brands' pump heads I decided maybe I should stick with the JoeBlow Pro. I called Todson which handles service/support for Topeak in the US (see the Topeak website for the phone number). At Todson a very nice representative arranged to send me a new gauge for $8.95 plus shipping $2.95. It wasn't too hard to replace the gauge (but it's stuck in there awfully tight) and now I have my great floor pump back! Topeak products are usually very good, but coupled with such great support they really move to the front of the pack for me."
1,"A Finger Eating, Arm Workout Of A Pump","I bought this pump with high hopes of it lasting forever and being easy to get up to high pressure. My first lesson learned was that the flip valve (that secures the pump on your tire) releases VERY quickly (read: the greater the pressure, the more power behind the release. I had fingernails snap back behind the quick, bruising on the fingers, etc). I quickly learned to steer clear of this, and thought I could live with the pump.Now (this is only two months after purchase), it won't get a good seal and will only easily inflate to 60 psi. The rest of the way to 120 psi is a race (who will win first - the leaking seal, or my arms, flapping wildly to try and inflate the tire). And I thought I wanted to get a workout on my bike. Perhaps I need to reassess my desires to: 1) arm work to exhaustion and sweating before getting on the bike, 2) leg work on bike. Or: I will get another pump. This is one for the trash."
1,Cheaply made,"Worked very well for several months, then would not form a seal. Even bought a rebuild kit from Topeak, but did not work. The head is junk."
1,"I agree with others, doesn't last.","I bought this pump over others based on the reviews here. Let me now add mine. Bought in March 2012. The pump worked fine for a few months, now will not seal on a presta valve. I will get in touch with Topeak, but I would discourage you from wasting your time with this one.Update 10/07/12: So I called Topeak and they were kind enough to send me a new head for the pump. Tried it on my presto valve with the appropriate adaptor, leaked terribly. Adjusted the head, pumped furiously, just flattened the tire. This pump is not worth 70 dollars and Topeak is not worth dealing with."
1,Faulty bike pump,"The needle on the gauge falls off if the bike pump is not upright. I was able to pop the gauge open and replace the needle, but then the gauge didn't work correctly."
2,Frustrating !,"I'd swear the foot on this pump is engineered to have the pump tip over/fall onto the pressure gauge. The head clamp lever springs closed so hard it will blister your finger. I've had this pump for two years and the gauge is off 10 psi too high at 110 psi. While it pumps up tires well, it just isn't ergo friendly."
5,Think I found a keeper,"Have gone through many pumps,,,guess it's true, you get what you pay for. Can pump to 120psi with ease. Love the switchable head, Now if I can only get the UPS guy to STOP opening packages !!! Get this pump....you'll have it a long time !!"
3,After 8 months lock level broke,"A good pump, very easy effortless pumping and no problem with pressure so far. I just thought it would last longer. The yellow pump lock level snapped in half after just 8 months of use. It still works, just not as convenient as it was before."
1,Doesn't last,"First head lasted about 6 months, had to pay Topeak to ship a new one. Second head lasted about 6 months. Heads work great untiul the seals stop sealing. Won't pay Topeak for another one. It's been used only on presta valves, about twice a week and well-cared for otherwise. Won't be buying another."
3,"Looks great, but...","Ok, get the pump and very please the way it looks. Unpacked it and left it sitting until next day. Next day tried to use it 3 times and unable to pump my bike's tires The air seem to stay in the pump or the pump will not open the valve to push the air in. Will be calling Topek to ask if I am doing something wrong, but after many years riding bikes I don'r know. I am mechanically able and not sure what is up. Simple pump is not that simple. I did push hard on the valve opened the lever, closed it and tried different ways and still no progress.I want a good functioning air pump and not a pretty one to look at!"
2,Looks better than it works,I purchased the pump for use on my bike and car. It's useless for the car since its next to impossible to secure the air valve to the tire valve properly.
2,Somebody Done Somebody Wrong,"Another aging, one-time star pumps out a ""new"" collection of their greatest hits. Songs that were great in their original release ... but that was a long, long time ago. The voice isn't quite what it used to be and seems to lean heavily on background vocals and instrumentals for filler and support. The ""new"" sound might fit well at a geriatric dinner & dance show. If you are looking for the original recordings try ""All the Hits: The Ultimate Collection."""
5,Awesome,"Very uplifting and relaxing. Beautiful artist! if you're feeling down, this will help in a pinch. Christian music at it's finest ;-)"
4,The Chosen is a great game,"If you like first person shooter games, with lots of gore and a great arsenal of weapons from flae thrower to M16 and just about anything else you can think of, then this is a great game to consider. I will not make the mistake of comparing it to Half Life, since most people I talked to about this game do not even go there. These games are different, even if the are in the same category (FPS). I personally liked Chosen more than Half Life. Let it be said that I played Half Life maybe a dozen times, but Chosen was my favorite for a dosen of weeks or more."
2,Do not buy. Watch bands break and no replacment avail.,"Watch band only lasts about 8 months, cannot buy a new one so watch is trash. Not good on your wallet or our earth."
1,Nike watch bands will break with no possibility to replace,"Beware. My Nike watch worked great, but after a year the band broke where it connects to the watch housing. To my surprise Nike does not sell band replacements. Watch still works, but now I can't wear it. Get ready to buy a new watch if you want to have a Nike one. I won't be among you."
1,Nike Triax Speed 50 Super Watch,I originally recieved this watch for Xmas and I had it out of the box for 10 seconds and the orange button on the face of the watch fell off. I returned it for the same watch and I have only been wearing it on runs for 3 weeks. I got home and the lower left button fell off. The watch is great with all of the functions it has but as far as realiabilty I would not recommend this watch.
2,Replacement Watch Bands,"I had my Nike Triax Speed 50 Super Watch # WR0083-002 watch for less than 1 year. The watch band broke where it attaches to the watch frame. I love the watch and it's been working great, however I can not find a replacement band. Not a good product if Nike is not going to provide support for the consumer."
1,Returned up after 5 days,This was my second Triax watch and my second bad experience. I had the watch for about 5 days and it locked up. None of the buttons would work. I replaced the battery and it still wouldn't work so I returned it.
2,Not up to Nike standards,"I am a big fan of Nike Triax watches, but had bad luck with this model. I had the watch for about 4 weeks and in that time it reset itself once and finally locked up - all of the buttons stopped responding. Replacing the battery had no effect and I had to return it. Additionally, the button on the face is a little too large and is too sensitive to accidental contact. When I would check the time I more often than not had to play with the buttons because I had inadvertently switched to some other mode. On the plus side, it is very comfortable and the display is easy to read."
1,band broke less than a year,"what a hassle. i've had it 9 months, and not worn it frequently, and the band just breaks. part pinned in to the face has the rubbery material break into pieces. ugh! i would expect it from a $10 watch, but not $100. my sports watch i bought at target works better! do not recommend."
1,"Repetitous, boring, doesn't deliver!","This book is a POORLY WRITTEN version of Dr. Edward De Bono's research and publications. Dr. Edward de Bono wrote about NEGATIVE thinking in The Six Thinking Hats more than ten years ago, and in several of his books. As a Six Thinking Hats graduate, I believe Norem's book is an embarrassment to the professional community. This book will NOT harness the negative person to achieve anything more than MORE NEGATIVITY. There is NO RECIPE FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE in Norem's book. Do not buy this book!"
2,Mildy entertaining,"This is probably not a great week for me when it comes to books. I read two this week that didn't wow me. They weren't bad. But they weren't great either. This book had some entertaining moments in it, but hardly enough to justify my time."
4,Typically Female Style,"Most Females (or other minority groups) appear to practice the management philosophy of Dr. Norem's positive negativism, perhaps because typically being followers rather than recognized leaders, they've often had to entertain the high probability of failure, due to bias, discrimination or simply histories of it. The idea that optimists occur across the gender gap, the racial gap, or the disability or ethnic minority gap is preposterous. Anyone who struggles with the presumptions of success as heavily concentrated in the domain of the majority is not logical to emotionally invest in that traditional attitude because of the failures they are used to having to absorb. Optimism, itself, is very much rooted in the success history of the past, and to those who are class, gender and identity favored. All of the rest practice to varying degrees the process of positive negativism by conditioning if not by training and experience. Why should it be otherwise?"
4,Nuanced look at different coping strategies,"While billed as a ""contrarian"" view, Norem's book is really a more nuanced look at what constitutes pessimism, optimism and the difference between them and hope. Consequently, she identifies highly functional people who are none the less pessimistic. These individuals deal with their preexisting anxiety by using the strategy of ""defensive pessimism."" Norem discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy, but shows how those people predisposed to handling their anxiety via defensive pessimism can be harmed by being optimistic. Norem spends a good deal of time making the important distinction between the defensive pessimist and other forms of pessimism that are truly debilitating.""The Positive Power of Negative Thinking"" is not a 12-step program. Instead, it is a highly accessible discussion of personality types and strategies for dealing with the anxiety that modern society brings."
4,UFO Adventure,"Overall Iliked the book. As with anything related to UFO's it's a 50/50 deal. Either they exist, or they don't, pretty simple. Now to be more specific I'm not talking about the idea of UFO's in the realm of air or spacecraft Gov't is constructing, but rather the possibility of other intelligent life that visits our planet for whatever purpose. The account given by the author was a fun read, because it was relayed from the memory and perspective of a young boy and his brother and the experience they had. I personally find the story and description of the beings in line with what I would imagine the beings would be like, and in a similar book ""Passport To Eternity"" the encounter the author had with the beings was similar to this story. Don't expect this to be written like Grisham, Clancey or Orson Scott Card etc. just enjoy the book for what it is, a young boy and his brother's adventure."
5,Young scientists will want to read this one again and again!,"With the loving support of her mother, and the admonition of her deceased father to perservere in her quest for ""curiosities"", Mary Anning went on to discover ancient fossils which earned her the friendship and respect of many well-known scientists of the early 1800s. Christians and Jews will want to change the reference ""millions of years"" to ""thousands"" to be in keeping with Biblical creationism, but other than that it is a great book. It is the kind of book a young scientist will read again and again... feeling the cold, salty air as Mary digs in the sand and scrapes at the stones that fall from the cliffs of the shores of Lyme Regis, England. Her relentless curiosity and faithful endurance led to her discovery of what we now call an ichthyosaur... at the age of only eleven!"
5,A good alternative to collecting the actual items,"Nowadays, the Halloween decorations from ""the old days"" are very pricey and scarce. So I decided to treat myself to some books dedicated to them.This book is very satisfying. The colors are vivid and the photos of the items are large enough to be able to see a lot of detail.I'm delighted with my decision to buy the book."
5,Sad it's gone...,"I've been ordering this same style of bra for a while now and because of my size it's difficult to find a good bra - and forget finding my size in the store, I have to order online. This was one of the most comfortable bras I've ever owned - I hate underwires so I was glad to find this bra and completely disappionted to find they've now discontinued it and I must search for a bra I like again, which is not easy when you can't try it on. Love the bra, disappointed in the Goddess company."
1,a game they dont want you to know operating system untill you buy it,"i bought this on faith it ran with windos and they do not tell you in any of the write up, you buy the game recieve it and find it only run's on old DOS computers, will not operate with any version of windows and they will not answer emails or offer a refund or replacement game, i recommend DONT BUY THIS unless you collect ancient software, the shipping was 3 times price of the game it self alsosundace58"
5,One Gem After Another,"This CD is full of the gorgeous fruits of Brahms' vocal writing during the mid 1870s. I never tire of repeated listenings of this disc. The quality of both sound and performance is first rate. Schmidt is especially wonderful. While Banse may not have the supreme sound of a Margaret Price, she certainly has plenty of artistry, musicality and technique. Deutsch's accompaniments are sensitive, exciting and clear. Recommended unresearvedly to all lovers of quality music and music making."
2,Very Choppy book,"I couldn't finish this book. It was very very choppy, sort of like reading a TV manuscript! And the characters came off as one dimensional and uninteresting."
5,beyond profound,"If you have never been satisfied with simple explanations of why people take their own lives than you will find this book so enlightening. In a time when our ability to address the growing rate of suicide seems to be getting weaker and weaker, Menninger's work stands out as a time-tested hope. A must read if you are a Psych student, psych patient or have any connection to persons who have committed or considered suicide."
5,"Its volatile history receives a charged, lively survey","Fans of the saxophone must have Michael Segell's THE DEVIL'S HORN: THE STORY OF THE SAXOPHONE, FROM NOISY NOVELTY TO KING OF COOL: it tells how just ten years after Sax completed his first prototype in 1843 the horn had traveled across the country and throughout Europe to change the musical world. The sax was banned by Nazis and Communists, and religious leaders alike which deemed the instrument 'profane'. Its volatile history receives a charged, lively survey by Michael Segell, NY Daily News editor who is himself an amateur saxophone player.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,how can this be taken seriously?,"No mention of Anthony Braxton? Evan Parker? Sam Rivers? These are people who developed new extended techniques for saxophone and cannot be ignored in a book as comprehensive as this one purports to be.Ornette in the list of people that (Charles) Parker moved to tenor? (I am aware that Ornette has played tenor, but come on folks, Ornette is most known for his alto playing. He probably has recorded his trumpet more than he has on tenor.)Dismisses Sun Ra as a ""space cadet""?Sorry, we cannot take Mr. Segall seriously."
5,Great summer read!,"My son read this book & passed it onto me. Since then, I've been able to exchange some emails with the author. It's a great read, and I don't read many books. It was different and unusual. Sort of a love story, but not really. Reminded me just a little of the writing style in ""On The Road."" Anyway, if you like to read stuff that's not all over the best seller list, check this one out!"
5,GREAT BOOK,Bought it to help my daughter with her research for her science project. The whole family enjoyed it! Great information and really worth taking the time to read through
1,The Map Doesn't Give Me A Zipcode,"I wanted to get zipdcodes by looking at a map. I have to look at the map and then look up each city one by one in a state index. The map says my zipcode is 919-921. The index say my city is 92008-9, 13, 18. They mailed my map to 92010. Simple, no? FWIW it arrived just fine."
1,Mispackaged Items,"The company said they had two items in stock... understandable since they had two packages with the part number on each. The company deals in overstock, closeouts, going out of businesses, etc., so it is also understandable that they have mismarked packages.1st package had all the right paperwork, but wrong connectors.2nd package had different edition of right paperwork, but different wrong connectors.Since they had no more packages with the right part number, they refunded my money.Good company, but know that you are dealing with an autoparts yard sale."
1,Disappointing - First Amazon Order May be my Last,"I needed a reference manual for patent filing and ordered Patent Office Rules and Practice (Paperback) by Lester Horwitz for $22.77. I thought this was pretty amazing because the forms manual with PTO Rules citations is over $4,000 new. I needed this for work and what arrived was the MPEP - Manual of Patent Examination Procedure, which was not written by Horwitz but is a Government publication composed of 2 volumes of rules--not a forms manual with rule citations. I wrote the seller and he asked me to send him the bar code off the volume I received. I haven't done that yet, but this book is going back. My firm signed me up for an available Lexis Nexis slot, so I now have access to the multi-volume Horwitz references and can do my job. When you get something for NOTHING, it's most likely NOTHING. You get what you pay for. Blah, Blah, Blah. True here."
3,Cat box liners,"Description does not indicate it is not a great fit for the swoop-up cat boxes (higher on back end), as it's rectangular and doesn't account for the extra room. Could be a bit heavier, as I've had some tears and my cats are declawed, inside-only, elderly kitties."
3,Jumbo litter pan liners,Liners are okay. I prefer the sample liners I received with the Jumbo Petmate Litter box they are bigger & have a thicker border.
3,"I love Wolfe, But","Normally I love all the Wolfe books, but this one, I just don't like. There is just something about taking Wolfe out of the old brownstone that just didn't work here."
1,Buyer Beware,This same pot rack with the grid is selling on Williams-Sonoma's website for $480.00. This company is selling it for $549.00. Just in case you were interested!!
3,Am I Alone,I didnt understand the concept of a cowbell as a musical instrument. Was looking for the old fashion kind. By the way wish i could find the kind of spittoon that was made more like crock. Not brass.
4,"OK Cowbell, a little high in pitch.","Length:: 0:09 MinsThere isn't much to say about a cowbell. Except I gotta have more.Here is the scoop - this is a fine cowbell, overall quality is good, it is well built with decent spot-welds, and the black finish is nice.You can easily change the sustain and tinniness by manipulating your grip using proper cowbell technique.With that said, this cowbell is a bit on the small side - therefore it is a bit tinny. I prefer a deeper cowbell, more of a tonk tonk tonk vs. a tink tink tink, so I will probably get a taller one and give this one to my little brother(because let's face it - a small cowbell is better than no cowbell).So...my advice is get a bigger one! 6 to 7"" should be perfect.I'VE GOT A FEVER BABY, AND THE ONLY PRESCRIPTION IS MORE COWBELL!"
2,Not a non-stick,"This omelet pan is poorly made. Its main problem is that eggs stick to its surface even when oil is used, so that when you flip the pan the egg sticks to the top surface and is not cooked on the other side because it does not settle down to the bottom of the pan. Also, the small handle gets so hot that you must use a pot-holder in order to flip the pan. Finally the pan emits an odor while cooking. This is by far the worst ""non-stick"" pan I have used."
5,Great Seat,"I am not one of those parents that appreciate primary color throughout my house so this chair was perfect. They say by cheap buy again, but this was definately not the case. It is so easy to use, easy to clean and you do not have to worry if it gets a ding or scratch since you did not pay an arm and a leg for it. At first it was difficult to snap the tray on, but after a while it became easier. Besides, I did not want a tray that was easy to remove. My daughter has used this chair since since 6 months and now she will be two soon and uses it without the tray. I plan on ordering another since we have a second child on the way."
4,Booster Seat,"This product meets all of our needs. We really like the compactness (since we have 1 year old twins, we need all the space we can get!). The girls seem to like being able to sit closer to each other than they did in their high chairs, exchanging food, drinks, etc. We are using it as a high chair now, but I like the fact that it can be used as a booster as well. The product itself was very affordable, but I was disappointed in the shipping costs that Amazon charges. Since this was the ONLY place online I could find this specific chair (the one I wanted b/c of the price), I had no choice but to pay the huge shipping fees.Overall, I love the product, but I am disappointed in the high shipping fees Amazon charges."
4,sturdier than it looks,"When my son announced one morning that he was ready for a booster (by holding up his legs iron-cross style and screaming ""NO NO NO NO"" when I tried to put him in his high chair), it was off to Babies-R-Us to find a booster, and FAST. This one appealed because of its price and its neutral color. When I first took it out of the box, I wondered if it would be sturdy enough, because the pieces are individually somewhat flexible. And, the directions on exactly WHICH way to feed the included straps through the base baffled me for a few minutes. However, once I snapped the pieces together and strapped it to the chair, I found that the booster is plenty sturdy and stable. The 3-point harness keeps him securely seated. I haven't tried to use the tray, preferring instead to put his plate on the table, so I can't comment on that. It is easy to snap apart and reassemble when a wipe-down is required. Great value."
2,"Inexpensive, but Flimsy","I ordered this item as my youngest child moved from the high chair to the table. I chose it based on price and other positive reviews. However, I found it to be flimsy and low quality. When my son is old enough to climb in and out of it himself, I may end up buying something better. It is fine for occasional use, but if I wouldn't lose so much on shipping, I'd have sent it back."
1,Horrible and NO Customer service!,"I purchased this item at a R us store today. We got it home and there was no T strap included. When I called the customer service line after being disconnected twice, I voiced my complaint. I asked how I would be able to obtain the strap and they said I had to purchase it if I want one. I told them it was a missing part, the seat has the holes to accomodate the strap, the strap was missing from the box. The rep then told me if my daughter couldn't sit in the chair with out falling out then maybe I shouldn't have her in a chair! The box advertises the chair is good for 18 mos plus. My daughter is almost 2 and I do not trust her sitting in a chair unstrapped. I don't think I am in a minority of people in this catergory. I then told the rep that any persom with an 18 month old wouldn't put their child in this seat and she then said so be it and hung up. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this chair to ANYONE."
5,Confusion,"The honesty of the author in ""This Game of Ghosts"" is startling, and refreshing. Joe looks at the experiences that have shaped his life, both before and after the accident, and is not afraid to criticise. Throughout the book, he comments on the loss of climbing friends, and the confusion this causes. The brutal honesty coupled with the questions raised by the deaths to which there are no easy answers make this a stunning book."
4,"Enjoyable, more thorough look at Simpson's climbing life.","Prepare for a switch in gears if you read this after ""Touching the Void"". It details not one rivetting account, but several harrowing events that possibly give the reader a better idea about who Simpson really is... at a party and on the mountain.Cliche in that it joins other climber's autobiographies on the bookshelf, but strongly needed after we kept scratching our heads in ""Touching the Void"" and asking: who is this guy anyway?"
2,Fascination of Death!,"Being I mountaineer myself, I have found ""Touching the Void"" absolutely rivetting and transcanding. I was therefore full of expectations when I bought ""This Game Of Ghosts"" and although Mr Simpson has a nice writing, I could not take his fascination about death. His constant reminder of all his friends who have died. This book could put off some mountaineers-to-become by its harsh, black view of the world and the Mountain. Mountain has a price yes but it is not all black; it has so many beauties and so much life."
4,Interesting True Life Stories of Climbing,"I have a taste for real life survival stories, and I particularly loved Simpson's Touching the Void. Although interesting at times, I felt this book was written because of Touching the Void's success. It tells of Simpson's life and why he chose to go round climbing mountains. His philosophy is at times incisive. Climbing (according to Simpson) diverts the mind from the more frightening things in life, that is reality, responsibilities and stresses of everyday life that can chip away at you. Despite of the risks, climbing is a sort of coping mechanism. Simpson's writing is engaging and interesting, particularly his close scrapes and near death experiences. Parts of book do meander somewhat, and it lacked a whole. But overall, it was an enjoyable read."
4,A great read,I've never read Touching the Void but enjoyed this book immensely. Well written... A great read!
1,Really?,"Very little bjork. Most of the random takes, butcher the song. As for Unicef I have seen what they do (or don't). This cd is for the super fan only."
4,On the Day I Was Born,This is a touching narrative of the day a child is born. It is a wonderful keepsake that makes a great gift. Pictures are touching and inviting. The text is nicely repetitive and engaging. Reminds me of Love You Forever by Robert Munsch.
5,Simply Delightful!,"To me Barbra is the most inspirational singer among other things. I am now twelve years old, and I love every peice of her work. This CD, includes over 77 minutes of music. Including Evergreen, The Way We Were, and Barbra conversing with the audience. ""As if we never said goodbye"", is wonderful, ""I'm still here/Everybody says don't/Don't Rain on my parade"", is new and original, ""I'll know(with Marlon Brando), is hilarious with the famous line Hello Gorgeous, ""People"", couldn't have been sung better, ""The Way We Were"", ""You don't bring me flowers"", and the Yentl Medly, are performed beautifully. At the age of 53 at the time of the concert, Barbra is proving that she is ""still going strong"""
2,"Wanted to hear her music, not her political and moral views","I bought this CD because I enjoy her music, but instead got an ear full of her (rather shoddy) political and moral views. I couldn't tell if she was entertaining or trying to gain pull from President Clinton. Very disappointing."
5,Great Olsenbook!!!,"I thought this book was great!! Mary-Kate and Ashley are going to the local museum to see a real mummy. But when they are in the museum, the mummy is gone! Another case for the Trenchcoat Twins. I really enjoyed this book. The Case of the Missing Mummy is my favourite 'New Adventure' book. Every Olsenfan should have this book, it's really great!!"
4,Samurai Warriors,"Samuari Warriors is a new kind of fighting game. This gameis a excellent fighting game because it has a lot of weaponsthat the samuari used. It has a lot of interesting weapons. Itis a four in a half because it isn't a five because it wasn't thatgreat has it seemed, but it was still a great game but it isn't a excellent game. The game had a lot of action for the buyera lot of action. I thought it is a great action game for people that like a lot of action games, and if you are a person thattakes karate you should get and you will like it, or if you are aperson that likes weapons or you collect then and use themor if you just collect them then you should get it because it isa great fighting game. So lets see if you're the next samurai."
5,Great book,"Of course, being a new mom again, I haven't had time yet to enter my son's information into the book, but I have had time to look through it. I love the layout and the eye-catching pictures. I'm ordering a second one for my older daughter. Her book only went to age 1 and I want to continue to add information through age 5.Any Dorling Kindersly book is sure to be enjoyed by all who look/read it!!"
4,Mother Goose art for the Older Child,This coloring book has beautiful pictures drawn from the artwork of Kate Greenaway. Adults and older children will enjoy the detailed work necessary for coloring these Mother Goose rhymes. The format lends itself to colored pencils rather than crayons due to the fineness of the artwork. The drawings evoke a bygone era which would be appreciated more by a more mature audience. Younger children would doubtless enjoy a simpler Mother Goose to color than that presented in this coloring book.
4,pay attention to the size,I just assumed that this was a full size clipboard. I ordered several and was disappointed to find out the true size but actually if you fold or tear a sheet of notebook paper in half it fits perfectly. Also the size is very convenient to carry around and they seem to be working out quite well. I deducted a star for unclear advertising. Also they show two clipboards and you only get one but they are actually well made and of five star quality. Very strong spring wont easily let go of your papers.
5,Good and Sturdy,"I was a little skeptical at getting a clipboard I couldn't really look at before purchasing, but I was already ordering some other stuff and I'm far from office supply stores. I ended up pleasantly surprised! The construction is just as solid as anything you'd find in a Staples or Office Depot. The clip itself is attached to the board so well that it'll never start wiggling around on you, the clip holds papers great (never lets go of them unless you want it to, but doesn't crease them), and the board is really sturdy and not warped.Simply put, its a good clipboard, and does what its supposed to. It won't leave you thinking ""dang it, why didn't I buy something nicer?"" When other people think that, its because they didn't buy this one."
2,Strange feeling,"I was just looking for a basic, boring clipboard. The one received is not the same color as the one pictured. No bother, I personally didn't care about the color. HOWEVER - this thing has such a strange feel to it. There is some material on the front of this thing that just feels ""strange."" I know, pretty vague, but I can't explain it. It is somewhat sticky, flaky, strange feeling material. I really can't explain it better than that. I tried to clean it off with little luck.I may use it - not sure yet. But the strange ""stuff"" that is covering it is really nasty. It almost feels like sawdust wish a strange consistency to it. It makes your hands sticky after you touch it. I wish I could explain it better. Tried to clean it off twice - I'll try one more then send it back as defective."
2,Rough edges and wrong color,"Pros:- Nice hard surface- Relatively lightCons:- Rough edges make holding it for any length of time uncomfortable- Light tan color, not the dark brown you see pictured- Mine arrived with slight chips/peeling on parts of the edge"
5,Excellent!,"Nothing beats this old standby. I've had a couple of these for years, then I tried some cardboard ones but the Saunders recycled hardboard are definitely better. They're harder and provide a firmer backing. I have no complaints."
3,Great except for the Payroll,"The peachtree accounting program is rich with features, but it also lacks some very basic features as well. You vitrually cannot use the payroll feature without spending 150.00 more per year for a ""optional"" tax service.The program severely restricts your ability to create tax tables on a global basis and it is time consuming to do this be each company set up.I see this ""flawed"" marketing approach as the largest weakness. No this is not software for a Fortune 500 company. But it will do the routine bookkeeping functions of a good size company.But when you add the cost of the ""annual"" tax service. There are better programs in the 300 to 500 price range that will give you more felxability.So for the price its a good value if you dont have a large payroll."
1,Endless problems with ink cartridges,"Reasonably solid built printer with built in networking - which is why I bought it. Unfortunately over the last year have had endless problems with ink cartridges - says they are empty when they are full - says they are not seeded correctly when they are (and the problem is elsewhere), etc. As soon as I am out of ink - this will be retired and I'm looking for a new printer."
5,Wonderfully entertaining and engaging!,My husband and I recently went on a 12 hour road trip with our kids ages 5 and 6 and I was scrambling for diversions. On a whim I picked up this CD and it was the hit of the road trip. We listened to it over and over again and after a few times everyone could recite their favorite lines by heart-even my husband! Denzel Washington gives a great performance on CD just as in the movies and BB King's music was very cool! I look forward to purchasing more Rabbit Ears stories on disc. Not only does it provide great music but the kids remember a great classic story they might not have wanted to sit still and read.
4,Addendum to,"In an earlier note about Peachtree I expressed displeasure that PCA 2002 no longer permits editing the ""Global Tax Tables"". It is true that this option apparently has been removed. However - one CAN still edit ""Company Tax Tables"" (Peachtree maintains two sets of tax tables - Global and Company - in case books are maintained for multiple companies, some of which require different calculations for the SAME type tax. If there is an entry in the Company tables with the same name as a table in the Global tables, the system will use the Company table.) And one CAN use these tables for all payroll computations, therefore, my original ire at Peachtree has moderated. Will install PCA 2002 after all. (My guess is that it is the custom of the majority of users to just spring the $$ for the payroll tax update service rather than try to figure how to update themselves. For me, I want the option to do it myself for nothing.)"
5,holds up well in AZ sun,I've had this Valterra set before. Don't know why I switched to some junk from Walmart. These don't leak. They're sturdy. The best part is the swiveling connections.
2,Couldn't get through it,"I found the chapters about Jewish life interesting and enjoyable, but the chapters devoted to the Emperor were just plain boring and very confusing. I found myself dreading the Emperor chapters and finally had to put the book down. Would have liked to keep reading, but couldn't muster up the interest."
2,Not So Slendid,"I was disappointed in many things about this book. The lack of character development is the most obvious. More time is spent on the city of Prague than anything else, and unfortunately this does not give much insight to the main players in the book. The few flashbacks and memories are lost among the city scape. More often than not, the reader is left in the dark as the story moves on. More than once a character will say something completely out of the 16th century context, making it very difficult to 'get into' the story. The book is very slow moving and the ending disappointing. It seems to end at the long awaited climax with an abrupt ""everyone lives happily ever after"" paragraph. I was hoping for more after reading the description on the inside cover. However all of the things which made the book sound interesting comprised about a line or two at most within the actual story. In general, a waste of precious reading time."
3,Got halfway through and gave up,"After 160 pages, this book was going nowhere. Long descriptions of the 1600's in Prague are interesting, but if I want historical details by themselves, I'll read a history book. There simply wasn't enough plot. I gave up."
4,A Fable for History,"This book was really well written, with the different aspects of life in Prague in 1601. The Jewish community was close knit and some of the rituals described were some that were not well known. The relationship between the heroine and the Golem were interesting and the way the Rabbi used the Golem to obtain things for his community were interesting. It reminded me of a story I heard many years ago which was an early TV play in the late 1940s, about a Golem. Frances Sherwood is a terrific writer and her prose is very beautifully relayed."
3,The Light and Dark Side of Civilization,"I was intrigued from the first introduction, which tells us about golem. How Adam was considered the first ever golem, made by God. From there on, it unfolds to the lives in the city of Prague, the center of power of Habsburg monarchy in 17-18th century.The story started on the new year event of 1601 when a Jewish wedding took place and the emperor tried to kill himself. Many messages you can get from it, from the grandeur of life, people, cultures to the foibles, follies and desire. I am not a history freak so I am not sure if the historical facts fit in but there is an explanation about it after the last chapter.It would be a better book if a qualified editor could take a look at the writings. The flow of the story itself was sometimes confusing, changing topic now and then, sometimes neeeded a paragraph re-read and there were so many mispelled names (although the author self defined them) and misplaced words."
4,"A nice user guide for SIMAN, a reasonable book for getting t","Systems Modeling produced this book to learn people more about simulation and SIMAN in particular. The general introduction to simulation seems to be included to hide the commercial goal of the book. The book is a nice form of a user guide for the out dated language SIMAN, but the first three chapters try to hard to add any generic value. A much better book is 'Simulation with Arena' by Kelton. The goal of that book is exactly the same (enlarge sales), but the generic part is of more value also for the not Arena user"
5,Cassandra's Dream - Great movie,A Woody Allen movie with Collin Ferill in it? Not typical funny Woody Allen but delving into the character Woody. Good story & well done.
2,"weak, woody","The problem with this film is a very weak script. Some of the scenes truly seem to be written in five minutes; in fact, most of the first half of the film seems as if it were written in one sitting, one afternoon. Nothing funny, nothing clever, nothing to give the scene anything. Talk about a film that needed a subplot or two -- not to mention a few more drafts. Or maybe a nude scene with Hayley."
2,"An old story, retold.","Man feels trapped by his circumstances and seeing no other way out, commits a terrible act (this will all be obvious long before it takes place). Unable to live with the guilt, he snaps. The End. No amount of fine acting can make this story more than it is, and given that all the major characters are more pathetic than sympathetic, who honestly cares what happens to them?This is the kind of story that David Mamet might pull off because he would be more clever with the dialog rationalizing why the crime was justified. As it is, its just grim. There is one nice Mamet touch; we're never told what dear old uncle Howard has done that leads to the movie's chain of events."
3,rather dark. why did I watch this.,"I like a lot of WA's movies. This one, however, is not a favorite. I got to the end of it and had to wonder why I just spent that time watching a big, stressful downer. That's just me though. Lovers of suspense films may like it. Very well acted and directed. It's just that I personally usually avoid trying to entertain myself by watching people suffer."
2,rent it only,"Lot of people seem to argue for or against this movie based on it being another Woody Allen movie. If you were to show this movie to a person without telling who the director is, I would venture that almost no one will guess the director. There's nothing about this movie to distinguish it. Ewan and Colin does ok work (Colin is definitely better) but Tom Wilkinson is totally wasted. Ewan will never be a great actor (name one outstanding performance) and Colin Farrell is way better in ""In Bruges"" besides that being a much better movie. For supposedly a family tragedy film, the movie lacks any real tension and feels strained in it's attempt to convey any melodrama. You may be mildly amused but don't waste your time and money buying it."
4,Probably should get a 5 star rating.,"The acting was great, the direction was great & the story was excellent. But there just wasn't enough shallow senseless violence & action."
1,"The most insipid and uninspiring Allen movie, maybe ever.","I've always been a huge Allen fan, but the last few years have been brutal, and maybe the old pro better hang it up. Characters that are as stiff as wood with dialogue that has no flow or insight. As in VCB, Allen presumes that a change of country for location (finally out of Manhattan) justifies the exposition of a pale, prosaic movie. The two brothers exist on the stereotypical thrills of poker and ""business ventures"", how novel? Allen, never one for character development, unfortunately has no story either. Once again, he continues his hot streak of flops outside the comedy genre. Worst of all, Allen has no clue how to add any tension/thriller elements to his movie. Again, he's totally out of his league. Not to mention an ending that's a total ripoff of Polanski's extraordinary Knife in the Water. The only bright spot was Tom Wilkinson's magnificiently conniving performance."
1,Poor Index!,"Has a really poor index.Can't find a way to delete ""[p]Some Text String[/p]"".Figured I would pay money and get this book. No dice.Save your money and just use Google."
5,Clever transforming book,"This is a clever transforming book, actually more like a giant card that flips into different scenes, much like those transforming puzzle cubes. My seven-year-old son loves these!"
1,Please!,"Great, yet another Christmas album worth trashing. Now that music is becoming more and more a part of culture an artist should try to head it in the right direction. This is a failure. This CD is so boring and stupid I almost threw my CD player. As for the songs, same things over and over again-drop dead boring. The vocals literally made me gag. Look into some real music, rather than a lame attempt to it. Don't waste $12 or more on junky backyard production like this."
5,I must admit that I have no objectivity in reviewing this CD,"If these gentlemen recorded a cd full of TV jingles, I would buy it. Once again, John, Anthony and Ronan have produced an album that will thrill and delight their fans along with those who have not yet discovered their incredible talent. Highlights: Anthony Kearns' ""Sweet Little Jesus Boy,"" sung acapella to perfection; John McDermott's ""Away In A Manger"" - so tenderly sung, it brings a tear to the eye; ""O Holy Night"" by all three is the most powerful and beautiful version of that Christmas favorite that I have ever heard; the arrangements by Frank McNamara are filled with surprises that will lift these Christmas standards above the ordinary. I could go on and on but won't. Just make this Christmas cd part of your holiday - you will not be disappointed!"
5,The Tenos Continue to Inspire us all!,"I felt fortunate to have seen the Irish Tenors in Los Angeles during their recent North America tour. Now, with the release of their second CD, ""Home for Christmas,"" I feel not only fortunate but blessed to be able to enjoy their immense talent both individually and collectively. Separately, they have their own powerful and unique styles, but when they combine their voices, the result is a thunderous wave of sound that continues to move and delight me. There is absolutely no doubt that their music, whether together or separately, will continue to effect all who listen for years to come! Their voices are a gift from God and I'm truly thankful they are sharing their gifts with us! Thank you John, Anthony and Ronan - you continue to inspire us all!"
2,If you loved The Irish Tenors PBS you may not like this one,"The best performance is Amazing Grace which was left off the PBS CD but is on this one. The Holy City is also quit good. The powerful harmony which was outstanding in the PBS original seems to be constrained or subdued in many of the Christmas Songs. I suspect the problem is with the arrangement, conducting and mixing."
5,Beautiful Christmas Music,"I really enjoy this music. I like the quality and style of music presented by the Irish Tenors, and I like Christmas music. This is the perfect CD for me. I like hearing it from early November through the holiday season. I have given this album as a gift, and it was much appreciated. I would recommend it for anyone who likes traditional Christmas music."
2,all over the place,"Very disappointing as the author lost me when he began talking too much about either his own life or the Seattle Weekly he worked for. There is plenty of interesting stuff about the usual Seattle stuff (Ivar's, the M's and Seahawks, the grunge music scene, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon.com, etc.) but it's all over the place. This book needed serious editing and more focus on what exactly the author wanted to say about Seattle. It read more like a series of disjointed essays.As far as Seattle goes, I got more out of the ""politics"" of the place reading Art Thiel's Out of Left Field and that book had a focus--specifically the history of the city's MLB team, the Mariners."
2,Overpriced for unassembled metal tubes and netting,"This ""cargo organizer"" would barely be worth the money if it did come assembled...the fact that it doesn't and the directions to do so are iffy at best,makes this item impossible to recommend. I don't know how long it will last,but I am not optimistic...spend your hard earned money elsewhere!"
3,Cute but not as soothing as expected,"My son loves Veggie Tales and while there are a few lullaby type songs, I found it to not be as calming and soothing for sleep time. I personally found it a little loud at times and annoying. It distracted sometimes and Veggie Tales is more of an upbeat thing rather than for sleep time. I say yes to their DVDs and music for play time, but not in a sleeping setting."
4,"Interesting, yet lacking in some regards","Okay, a comprehensive look at cliches would probably be larger than the OED. However, while there are great items in here, there are certainly some missing that I'd consider in common usage. Still a great book that's always next to my chair for a quick glance at every now and then."
5,So Cute!,"what a cute little jacket! fits like a glove- true to size, slightly fitted, with a great retro vibe. i love it."
5,Yummy time,"Matouk's Flambeau Sauce with aged pickled scotch bonnet peppers (a cousin of the habañero, the scotch bonnet is a bit sweeter) this sauce reminds me of some ""jerk"" recipes I've tasted. If you think the typical hot sauce off the shelf is hot, only add a small amount of this to your food. If you're like me and have chomped down a ghost chili without flinching, then Flambeau is a great addition to any meal. It's not the hottest sauce out there, but is one of the most enjoyable. Great flavor."
4,Very good hot sauce,"This hot sauce packs some pretty good heat and the flavor is pretty good too. I first found Matouks Salsa Picante Hot Pepper Sauce and then tried this flavor (Flambeau) out because I thought it might be hotter. In my opinion, it is about the same level of hotness and the Salsa Picante has a little bit better flavor. Bottom line is that they are both great hot sauces but I lean towards Matouks Salsa Picante Hot Pepper Sauce flavor. I've also shared both of these flavors with hot sauce aficionados and they all agreed with above sentiments."
3,ok - but nothing more.,"I bought this cd first thing after I heard ""dreams"" on the radio. I must say, the rest of the album is less good, but still, ""find your way"" is a nice hip-hop cd."
5,Sweet But Never Saccharine,"These powerful compositions capture moods that most writers find elusive. For example, here is a sound of nostalgia without cloying sentiment. The feeling of rich country without corny quotations from mid-western music. Great variety, brilliant instrumentation. Wondrous emotional clarity. If you buy this disk, you'll love it--even if you haven't seen the film yet."
5,Beautyful,no other comments - but this is going to be my new relaxation-cd VERY SHORTLY. Excellent work!
3,A Departure for Badalamenti & Lynch,"A saccharine-sweet departure from Badalamenti's prior jazz-tinged and experimental soundtracks for Lynch films, it still features Badalamenti's signature darkly sentimental orchestrations - added are Midwestern-flavored guitar and violin, creating a sedatedly atmospheric listening experience, which sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, without the Malick-inspired imagery of Lynch's G-rated, family-friendly film."
4,Great Soundtrack,We love this soundtrack to what is a sweet movie. We actually bought it to play in our newborn daughter's room during calm down time. Definitely a soothing soundtrack.
3,works infinitely better on screen than on cd,"angelo badalamenti's score for the straight story is one of his warmest and most evocative yet. however, divorced from the sweeping visuals and the gently heart-tugging narrative of the film, the soundtrack feels rather hollow and surprisingly samey. especially considering the aural richness and variety that struck me while i was watching the film."
5,Great movie and soundtrack,This music is suited so well to the movie. The movie was great and the music is adapted to the gentle landscapes and scenes of the movie. It is very soft and gentle with soft stringed guitars. One of the best sountracks of my extensive collection.
3,mystery missing chapter,"This was a great read - absolutely first class apart from a bunch of typos and the missing last chapter - there is a wonderfully easy to read, full of interesting connections narrative all the way to the last chapter, with a title page ""The Base"" but no chapter following. I was woefully disappointed as the base contains a carving so different from the rest of the vase and cannot possibly be a part of the original. Ah well, one is becoming accustomed to errors in typing - I suppose missing chapters are just the next step in slovenly publishing."
1,tutorial for canon 20d,expected tutorial to be more informative. the dvd was very very basic and i didnt find it to be very helpful.
5,Play It Again and Again for Me What a Album!!,"If you are ready for a album that has a varity of music then this is it. The party song will put you in a party mood and the love songs such as Lights On, Wind You Down and So In Love will take you to another place in time and fill your heart with so much love. And don't forget to listen to the Big Girls song it's off the hook.This is album is not to be miss!!"
5,Salt N Pepa,"I enjoyed recieving this CD. I had it before, but it was stolen by some near-do-wells who couldn't buy there own. Anyway, it is an excellent CD for you old school-ers by a group of ladies that knew how to rap. You won't find this type of sophisticated rapping anymore (at least not in my age bracket)."
5,Too too true,"No one does it better than Salt N Pepa when it comes to hardcore rap lyrics mixed with sweet funky rhythms. And do these women tell the truth? Check out ""Sommatime Man"" ""Somebody's Gettin' On My Nerves"" or ""Whatta Man"" and see if you don't find yourself adopting their p.o.v. as your own! Totally crucial S&P!"
2,Just average,"Very Necessary has great hits (Shoop, Whatta Man), and the excellent Break of Dawn (which didn't become a hit but should have been IMO). But, the majority of tracks are poor to sub par IMO. I think its worth buying, but don't expect a masterpiece!"
4,Great price and great product,It is hard to find these CDs and my mom was very happy I was able to find it for her and purchased it for her too.
5,Memories of the 90s!,"I miss girl rap groups like this considering there really weren't very many to begin with. This cd brings back memories and I'm so happy I bought this cd. Great price for a great cd. :)I used to have the cassette tape and I've been wanting the cd for a long time, but I didn't want to pay full price for it. Very happy customer!!"
4,Great stuff,"Technically precise metal, but retains some looseness with some unorthodox sounds and dynamics. Creative riff after riff, each song jam packed. Very clean and tight playing from the entire band. Highly recommended for the hard rock fan."
4,good buy,"These pillowcases are a good buy. A little stiff to lay your face on, but it is MLB brand, and colorful."
1,CLASSIC MOVIE - AWFUL COPY,"Purchase this dvd at your peril! There was no indication that a Region 1 disc was to be issued, so i purchased this Pal Region 2 version in the UK. What a disappointment! I noted this was not issued by Fox who released the original movie. The color transfer is absolutely awful, mainly pink, and shifting continuously - it looks like a product from some interim stage of the restoration process.I have just received a copy of the Region 1 Fox disc from Amazon, and it is superb, just as this fabulous movie should be."
2,Overacting by Finney,Audrey Hepburn makes the movie worth watching and as a motoring enthusiast there are some interesting vehicles. Overall the movie is disjointed and the character played by Albert Finney is so unappealing that he spoils both the romance and the comedy.
2,Might have been fun to watch in the 60s but not now,"My wife and I barely got through this film. We found it dated, disjointed and not particularly cute. Audrey Hepburn is always beautiful -- even when covered with dirt. The locations were lovely. The DVD quality was fine. We found the multiple time shifts a bit too disjointing without adequate anchoring. The dialogue also seemed dated and the trick of speeding up the camera to ""comic"" silent movie speeds was cute once, but got ""old"" when repeated several times. Not a film for the ages."
3,"Great movie, terrible revised color",This is a wonderful movie from 1966 that spans a 15? yr marriage with all its ups and downs. The color was revised in 2005 but when we watched the DVD everyones faces were orange! We watched anyway and enjoyed the story. When I went back to Amazon intending to return the movie it said to try in another DVD player and the color was fine. I tried in my original player and the color was ok there too. I will play one more time to see if the orange faces show again:).
4,60's classic,"Vacation in France in six steps of the lives of relatively young married people. They go from hitch hiking to a Mercedes Benz in a space of a little over ten years. They have all the problems of modern marriagesand all the best of a very good relationship.They actually seem to understand each other's faults.I liked even though it is so a ""chick flick""."
5,I love this movie!,"This movie is timeless. It is beautifully written, photograghed, directed. The acting is second to none. Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are completely convincing as a long time married couple whose marriage is not always perfect. Their characters show vulnerability and the insecurity that often goes with real life relationships. They positively sizzle on screen and are both a delight to watch, their persons and their acting. The locales make it that much more beautiful, the gorgeous countryside in the south of France. What's not to love? It is a poignant love story about the enduring bonds of a loving relationship."
4,ah the sixties,This is a wonderful caper and a film made for Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn. Several scenes stand out such as the one where they are in the hotel and didn't realize that breakfast was included. The constant flashbacks are not at all irritating and only add to the sense of film at the time it was made. For anyone who admires the light breeziness of Albert Finney and is madly in love with Audrey Hepburn this is a film for you. Great stuff.
3,A Slice of 60s Pop Culture,"Hepburn and Finney act well, and their chemistry is obvious. Though the film's portrayal of romantic love is a bit shallow and completely sex-driven (mirroring the social changes of its time), the way in which the plot's timeline is scrambled is clever and provocative. Mancini's score is gorgeous and elicits the romantic idealism and nostalgia which colors the entire film."
1,poor print,"There are at least 2 different DVD-releases around, both listed at amazon under the title ""Two for the Road""One of which (Optimum release, ASIN: B0002ADWIA) is to be avoided, it's a poor print!Make sure you buy this release from2oth Century Fox, ASIN: B000AP04MOalso available from amazon.com.A few dollars (not a fistful!) more but MUCH better picture quality!"
4,Two for the Road,"This movie is absolutely spectacular. Consider it the ""indie film"" of it's time, as it was created in 1967, but filmed in a non-linear fashion. The story follows a couple by the names of Mark and Joanna Wallace through a series of trips to the South of France with one another.The best part about the whole film is the fact that it feels so real. The banter between the couple is witty, fresh, and relatable. I highly recommend it. Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn have great chemistry."
1,Two for the Road,"I am so sad. I cannot play this CD unfortunately. I get a message ""check your area code"" that's all. I would very much appreciate what is wrong with this CD and/or what I could do to be able to play it."
1,Tears from boredom!,"Of all the Audrey Hepburn movies the talented actress made over the years, this one is without a doubt her most ridiculous attempt at acting. Only 15 minutes into the film and any attempt at humor becomes a trite waste of time. Her relationship with Finney is never well established or meaningful and leads to one boring scene after another. She must have been ashamed after this bomb."
1,Audrey - Spectacular as always. Finney - Argggghhh!,"After purchasing this I have only been able to watch it once. Audrey Hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she (Joanna in this) is brilliant as always. However, Albert Finney's roll (Mark), charactor and performance is in stark contrast. The further the movie goes the more I disliked Mark and was angry that Joanna was putting up with him. Mark's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable. Five stars Audrey, minus four Albert."
3,hot diggity dog,I really find it hard to think that anyone liked this movie. Maybe it's just me and my simple mind but I had a hard time following along. It's like trying to follow that kid through the maze in the shining. It'll drive you crazy.
1,......... dull and depressingly dreary,"During my viewing, I hung in there with `Two for the Road' for what seemed like hours. It couldn't have gone on nearly as long as it felt: the DVD jacket promises a merciful `finita' after one hundred and eleven minutes. Waiting for it, I couldn't remember time hanging that b-o-r-i-n-g-l-y heavy since my high school sixth period Latin class. I refused to give up on it, entertaining the notion there would emerge some semblance of a plot...... like `it simply can't go on and on and on like this without something happening sooner of later......."" Well, it did and it does. How the most photogenic and stunningly beautiful actress on earth (Audrey Hepburn) couldn't manage a film possessing a plot is incomprehensible.It is, however, a film of distinction. It is the first I have had that found it's way into a garbage can immediately upon its initial viewing."
4,Two For the Road is a down-to-earth movie...,"I like this movie because you can see Audrey Hepburn as a normal every day woman. It's funny, romantic, sad, and just plain wonderful. Audrey's clothes are fantastic!!"
1,Two for the road,It was not clear that this disk is in european format and will not play on US DVD players. After unsucessfully trying to view the disk on both DVD and Blue Ray players I managed to find on Amazon verification that this is indeed a DVD that will not play on US formated machines. I am a little disapointed that Amazon would sell a product that is useless. I am so disgusted that I have thrown out the disk. Buyers beware! Make sure you know what your buying.
5,Two For The Road,"Two for the Road is a charming film about a couple who've been married for several years who have begun to walk past each other without paying attention to each other. On a road trip, they talk about the possibility of divorcing. However, as they travel roads that they had traveled in their youth, fond memories are recalled about how much they had loved each other. It is those memories of loving times past that eventually convince them to enliven their life together. One of the best of several movies that have followed with this particular theme. Also, one sees a much younger Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn. Anna M. Seidler"
