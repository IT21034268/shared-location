1,Bad product,"Seems like a good company selling a bad product. Even with several attempts at recharging this battery, it holds a charge a LOT shorter than it should."
4,Great reading for watch fans - don't expect miracles though,"This book is tremendous value, with great pictures of the fine watch brands current ranges. Potential buyers should not expect too much in the way of detailed technical information however. If you treat it as a reasonably comprehensive, non-biased catalogue for some fine Swiss watch brands, you wont go far wrong."
3,Pretty good game,"We bought this game for Christmas for out 6 yr old son. It can be a little difficult though. It's a little too hard for my son-I would recommend Shark Tale. He really likes that one because the enemies don't come after you-you go and fight them. In Shrek the enemies attack you...the village people come after Shrek and he doesn't move fast at all. It's a little frustrating unless you really know the ""in's and out's"". I would love to watch the person that got it done in 5 hrs, because after 4 days I still can't pass it. Good luck-I would recommend Barbie-The Princess and the Pauper or Shark Tale for younger players around the reading age. I hope this helps."
1,Not as good as I thought.,"In the game, you don't even get to play wih Fiona, or be the mice or donkey while he's a horse!And it has only like 20 levels or less.But even the graphics are bad, the cookie is bigger than Puss. And Puss is bigger than Donkey. Besides, this game is a little fun, but no so much, because the levels don't last long, so, even if it had 40 levels, you would last 1 week winning the game.Don't waste your money with this game, it's not worth it."
1,Flimsy,Thought this might be a help for a friend that was unable to speak.Received in a soft USPS envelope whcih was unable to protect the item from flexing and it was torn and wrinkled overall.Only has a 4 1/2 x 7 inch writing surface which was not taught.Hard to see what was written because of the very loose surface.The cardboard frame has no rigidity at all.A child would destroy it in a very short time.Delivered cost to me was $12.22.Magic Slates
2,Very poor quality,"The product does work as described, but the the durability is pathetic. It's just made cardboard and plastic film. Wont last a day with my kid. Returning."
3,was expecting more,"this thing isn't worth much, i personally don't like the slide out way of erasing, i'd rather a pull sheet. the top plastic sheet is all crinkly and is too big for it. When you draw, it's always moving around. not worth a few bucks a pop."
2,Increased Shipping,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Grandson so can't comment yet on how he likes it. I have had these before and it was pretty much as expected. How ever, please beware of the difference in shipping cost by Huggable Me. The ad claims $3.00, but I was charged $6.95 in shipping. Some how I don't think this is worth $8.94"
2,Magic Slate,"I was disappointed in the quality of this magic slate product for the price. It looked sturdy on the picture but is really a flimsy cardboard, not even flat. It is like the old 5 and 10 cent store magic slates with the twist that instead of pulling up to erase you slide the sheets...and they sometimes gets stuck when sliding them back into place. The best I can say is that the magic slate serves its purpose."
1,Magic Slates review,"It's a waste of money, though it only costs under $4. It consists of a paper board that can be easily pulled out but hard to put back by a baby b/c it's a type of thin paper, so you'll have to lend a hand. The 4 colored sides are also paper and the screen is made of cheap plastic.It looks cheap, feels cheap and only last for minutes, for it's easily tore apart by any curious 18 months old baby.Not recommended AT ALL. It's not worth even under $1."
1,Defective or just easy to break?,"This arrived with the plastic all wrinkled and the way that this particular slate is built, you cannot remove the slate from the cardboard frame so there is no chance you can straighten it out so you can actually write on it. The design is so flawed compared to the other ones, I was really disappointed and had to return it. Not even worth $1 IMO"
2,magic slate,This product I looked for everywhere. I was so excited when I found one for my kids that I purchased it immediately. It did not last through the first play. Very cheap. Very very cheaply made. Not happy with this one.
3,A vital tool,A real time and paper saver for people studying any language with a non-Roman script. Wore out a number of these while studying Chinese.
3,Good for quick notes,"This toy is not much of a toy. As the price would allude, it's cheaply made. It was perfect for my uses (to display the principle of impermanence for a school project). I could see it being useful as a eco-friendly way to write notes or practice writing, but I doubt a child would want this."
1,Very very Disappointing,"On Xmas, my 2 brothers and I all got: Namco II: Ms Pac-Man with 5 TV GamesSince we didnt all want the same one, my mom exchanged the other two. I got this game. It is a stinker. All games are very boring, take no skill, sound is terrible. I love old games. I play original Nintendo all the time. If you want to get a good plug and play game, Go with the Namco II. I am selling this one because it is very boring. My stars above are not exaggerated. I played it for less than 5 minutes (enough time to test all games) and then didnt play it again. The Namco II has much funner games."
1,bad seeds,these seeds suck. i used the last 4 yesterday from the 2 packets i bought. i give these until 6/1/07 to sprout ? if not i want a refund.the moles will be hungry and i'll have no garden. !
2,Lovely Plant But Very Toxic,"Do be careful. Castor beans are very toxic. In fact all parts of the plants are toxic. Cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, fowl, rabbits and other small animals are all suceptable. Children could also pick up the seeds and eat them. Though the plants are lovely and exotic, I decline to grow them due to this issue."
4,new resistance,"I snapped this CD up today (just for the demo of new resistance, really) and, I dunno - I kinda loved it. Then again I loved ""The Burning Red"". If you liked the last Machine Head album, this EP is probably worth looking at."
4,Barska 7 x 50's,Fast delivery. Nice product but the first time I removed the lens caps (big end) the attachment that holds the caps to the binoculars broke right off. Basically a poor design - I can't see how the designer expected the heat set button to ever function. I just use the caps as if they were never attached.
1,EXAMPLE SENTENCE ?,I would like to ask the author to include more detais about this product. These descriptions are vague. For example: Are there example sentences ?
1,"Not even remotely ""fragrance free""","DO NOT BUY if you need a fragrance-free product! Even if none of the ingredients is intended as fragrance, this product smells perfumey and bad. Unsafe for MCS - beware!"
3,A Good Helper for a Person with Hand Strength,"This reacher is a very handy size. You can keep it near your chair and use it to conveniently pick up almost anything - papers, pencils, mail, food particles, leaves, buttons, pills, etc. The suction cups surround the fallen item nicely so that all pieces come up at once. Items that are very heavy can not be picked up effectively. The only problem with this reacher is that the handle is very hard to squeeze and hold squeezed until the item is retrieved. If you have good hand strength like my daughter, it is fine. My arthritic fingers and wrist do not squeeze it properly without a lot of effort."
3,Kind of boring,"This video is boring. I love TRL and it just didn't really interest me. The performances were cool, but the whole ""behind the scenes"" parts were very boring. If you want this video because you love TRL, I would highly recommend not buying it. If you want the performances, then, by all means, get it!"
2,Ugh!,"This tape could've been so much better. The best parts, in fact they are the only parts you should watch, are the performances by the individual artists and groups. The rest is thoughts from other people and it's very boring. I had to pinch myself to stay awake when I was watching it, and I love TRL. Honestly, even if you love the show, you will probably HATE this video. It is not a masterpiece. It's not a work of art. It's a boring tape that is only redeemed in the performances of the singers that have made the show so popular in the first place. So, please, do not waste your money on this tape."
2,Kind of lame,"I watch TRL every day faithfully so of course I bought the video. They go behind the scenes and talk to the producers and all the other people involved with the show and talk about all it takes to get TRL on the air every day. They take you on a tour of MTV and they show a few bloopers and greatest moments but all of them are pretty recent - and I know TRL has been on the air for a few years now. Worst of all, they don't even talk to Carson - Hello! He's the host. I know these other people work really hard and do a real good job - but I tune in to watch Carson not these other guys. There are some really good performances on there (although they have too many pop performances - *NSYNC, BSB, Christina Aguilera, 5ive). If you could possibly rent this video I would - I really wouldn't recommend buying it unless you really want the performances."
2,OK,"This video was ok, i watched it as soon as i got it, but i have not watched it since, it is not one of those movies where you can watch it over and over again."
3,Only So-So....,"I was expecting a little bit more than what this video ended up offering, they didn't talk or even show Carson that much and most of the time was spent talking to producers and people like that about what they thought of the show. The highlights were the preformances (especially the *NSYNC one that starts the video out ) and the bloopers."
3,The Melting Pot.......,"""Total Request Live"" mixes pop with rock, rap,and r&b; throughout their hour time slot. Preteens and teens enjoy voting via phone or through the official TRL Website at the MTV.com, then wait for the results to emerge. Totals often are shown, during the earlier years 1998,1999.Kids pack the studio, or the streets below in anticipation of their favorite acts being closeup,unscripted,and in your face!No matter how many times an artist returns,viewers see them in a raw, and open setting. Sometimes, the famous get in on the own requests, by shout outs, during videos!This gives a behind the scenes look at the studio, Host Carson Daly, and those crazy fans!See how a number of stars graced the TRL Stage, becoming newly found sensation........"
5,"Bright, Rugged, Reliable","Bought this lamp about a year ago, when we lost power the neighbors saw the light on in the window and wondered how come we had power. We didn't, this light was so bright that they thought we had power."
4,Official Price Guide to Old Books,This is a treasure of a book and a wealth of knowledge. What fun it is for a collector to track their investment.
2,Too Light,"I bought Nars Penny Lane Blush because of all the great reviews. I didn't want a color that was too bright, however, Penny Lane Blush is way too light. I had to put a lot on to be able to see it and I have very fair skin. This is the kind of thing you should really buy in person."
3,Enough good tidbits to make it worth it,"The theory this book is based on is that women are taught from childhood to live by the Code of Goodness. This Code ends up making women feel used and powerless and leads to many relationship and self esteem problems.The beginning half of this book was a little tough for me to buy into. I don't completely agree with all of the theories on why women have a tendency to be ""too good"", but there was enough helpful insight that I thought it was well worth the read. I don't think you have to completely agree with the author in order to get something out of this book. It was easy to read and well organized.NOTE: I think many men also suffer from being ""too good"" and that they would also benefit from this book. Unfortunately, it could turn them off because of the way it is written so directly to women."
5,"Good quality, quick delivery",I was happy with my purchase and my nephews are extremely happy with playing a game I used to love to play when I was there age.
2,OK,"Okay item. Worth the $7.48 for the two. They aren't easy to clean and show ever piece of dust. Not as heavy duty as I probably need, but fun to have, and do get some comments."
1,thermostat is inneffective,"The thermostat is all but useless except when the heater is set to the lowest setting. On medium and high setting, I'm guessing because the thermostat is perhaps too close the heating coils, the heater won't stay on for more than a few seconds at a time and only turns on once every 1-2 minutes. As a result, the room doesn't warm up.It works quite well on the lowest setting though, but unfortunately that can't keep the room very warm."
1,Must be a lot of lemons in the bunch,"Bought this heater at my local hardware store before reading these reviews. Sounds like they either work or they don't. My didn't. I brought it home, took it out to the garage (about 35 F out there today), plugged it in and waited about an hour to see if it would warm up. Despite being on the highest setting and having the thermostat on it cranked, the heater barely put out any heat. It was level and stable, but the only heat I could feel from it was from about two inches away, and that felt like a hair dryer on the lowest setting (and that's being generous).I returned it. I'm sure some of these heaters really get the job done, but I can't imagine that mine was functioning properly, and it sounds like a common problem. Light came on, fan whirred away (a little) but barely any heat came out. My halogen work light put out more heat at three feet away. Find another heater."
1,Works great--until it doesn't,"I was so happy with this heater, at first.It had good heat output, was incredibly quiet, and produced no chemical odor after a couple hours of use.However, within two weeks, it stopped working. Even the fan won't come on. The only sign of life is the indicator light.Sigh."
1,Not the same as previous years,"I have three of the older models of this heater. They are great and still functioning great and I use them hard. I wanted to get three more to replace any of the old three if they do breakdown. Saying this I can set the old and new side by side and compared heat output. I heat an entire three car garage with one of the old ones. One of the new ones will not heat a insulated room half the size. I may return the two unopened heaters. With just about every company manufacturing for ""Built in obsolescence"" I don't know what to do."
5,Great single!,"Before purchasing this single, I was a little wary of paying import prices for a single with just two songs, one of which is also featured on Babyshambles' debut album (albeit in re-recorded form). Let me tell you, it was worth it. This version of ""Killamangiro"" is sharper and more wiry than the loose-sounding album version. Both are fantastic, and the original recording might even be better-- it's hard to decide. And ""The Man Who Came to Stay"" is simply one of Pete Doherty's best songs. Just beautiful. I'd strongly recommend this single to any fan of ""Down in Albion."""
2,thumbs down,"this book may be very good as a reference for someone who already has a grasp of syntactic theory, but for a student in an introductory course it is confusing, cluttered and too far above my head. it takes no straightforward approach, and instead wastes pages repeating, but not clarifying, what it has already said. it is the least user-friendly textbook i've ever owned."
3,A good start,"Best Young Adult Novels, while some titles covered in this book are not well known the authors do a fine job listing the subject matter in the toc so that you know whether or not you want your class to read it. The activities/tests are well thought out and complete with extension activities. My complaint is that I thought it would cover more main stream novels. There is not a list under the description for the workbook. The authors evidently feel that Judy Blume is an important author as her books are included a number of times, other authors included are Barbara Brenner, Walter Dean Myers, Jan Greenberg, and Sharon Bell Mathis, Wilson Rawls, Rosa Guy, Paul Zindel, Fran Arrick, Cynthia Voight, and Irene Hunt. My compliment is that they do include a wide range of activities so that it covers all reading levels, so there is something for everyone!"
1,Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,"Do NOT buy this book from Superbookdeals!They misrepresented the product that they're selling-- I thought I was ording the ENTIRE Harrison's but only Volume II arrived.After spending much time on the phone with their representative, they came to the conclusion that it was MY FAULT for not reading their disclaimer at the bottom of the page in small print stating that this is a two-book set. I still have yet to see this disclaimer.Superbookdeals needs to re-list this book under a DIFFERENT image and a DIFFERENT title!I will never buy from these folks again!It would be best to purchase your Harrison's at a medical bookstore.I'm a medical student and do not have a lot of time to go to the post office to return (what is know 2 copies of Volume II!). ARGH!!!!"
5,an excellent reference,"There is no doubt that Harrison's is an indispensible reference for internal medicine. The writing is clear, and lay-people as well as medical students and professionals will find a lot of useful and understandable information here. While in my opinion the extra color and illustrations have not added a tremendous amount of value to this new edition, the rapid evolution of medical thought makes the latest updated editions of texts such as this highly recommended."
5,very satisfied,"Thank you so much, I am very pleased with the book, delivery, collaboration :)Books are in great conditionDelivery was fastPpl from Anybook Ltd. are more than generous"
5,The best.,All you need to know and much more. Excellent edition and contents.The worst shipping I ever got.
1,Old-fashioned and way past its prime,"Does anyone still actually use this antiquity? It's like a million pages and you never get thebig picture. Not worth the time, and crazy expensive. Lots more succinct books out thereto learn your medicine like Strong Medicine for Step 3. It's the 21century already andnobody uses it anymore except to look up obscure trivia, more as a way to stump theattending. I gave it a 5-star rating though, because, as a reference for major presentationson specific topics, there's not much better. Uptodateonline is actually a lot better organizedand the information is more accessible with CD and online versions, so finding data is fasterand more reliable. I also gave this relic a 5-star rating simply because it gives an ideal upperbody workout."
3,Still the best?,"Despite the new lay out this book just feels dated. New texts such as ACP medicine seem to have claimed the throne. The ACP book is just as complete, has better pictures and graphics and an excellent web site. Could also skip the books and just invest in UpToDate."
5,Bible for medical students,"No matter what your professors/classmates/nay-sayers say about how thick and heavy, convoluted or expensive this book is, it doesn't matter because YOU NEED THIS BOOK if you are a medical student, period. In fact, you'll save money in the long run b/c this book will pre-empt your need for many other books (not all, so be careful)."
4,Harrison's aka Da Cash Cow,"Aight, so I will give it up. The book has a couple of facts about medicine, but homie, how much cheddar is this fool makin off my behind? I mean like damn, EVERY MD and they momma has gotta have this book. And they come out with new editions like Puffy comes out with new names. Like I haven't given these dudes enough bread in med skool? And a hundred dollars?! I'm not gonna say what I coulda did with that kind of spinach, but lets just say it resembles spinach. It do got a good chapter on Ozzie Guillen-Barre though. Makes my legs all numb.Get it??Aight, Em Deezie out like a fat kid in dodge ball!HOLLA!"
4,Wonderful British Drama,"After the opening salvo - that is sex scene - between Aiden Gillett and Charlie Hunnam, this original series opens into a wonderful drama of gay life. Of course, there are still more sex scenes (a delicately filmed threesome) but the real drama revolves around everyday issues of being gay. Unlike it's American counterpart, this series pulls no punches and never underestimates your intelligence.The characters are believable and although not always lovable (Stuart, you bugger!), you can't help but root for even the bad guy. Won't you don't tolerate are the eggheads and snobs that permeate all strata of life. In other words, the know-it-alls do get their comeuppance. The three major characters are first class actors. They make you want to come back for more.Get the series and get a first class taste of gay life!"
5,Sexy and viciously funny,"This has got to be the raunchiest, sexiest TV-series ever. I didn't even know you could show that stuff on TV until QAF came along. I know now!QAF is a rattling good story, with characters you can believe in, even if they're larger than life sometimes. (I did wonder how Stuart was able to stick to his high-paid job when all he could think about was SEX, SEX, SEX!) And the laughs come hard and often, even if they're laced with cruelty sometimes.Much of the enjoyment comes from the couterie surrounding the three main guys: Vince's slutty mother, Alexander, the lesbian couple, and the various tricks that turn up at Stuart's loft.Whether straight audiences will run for the hills after watching this display of in-your-face gay lib, well I couldn't care less. I love QAF!"
1,I wish I could give it less than 0,"I heard all the raves about this show so I tuned. Frankly I could not see what all the fuss was about. It was absolutely pretentious and obviously done to shock. As far as I am concerned it fits into every gay stereotype that I have ever heard. That gay men are imature, irresponsible, mysoginistic and promiscuous. Stuart is a pig and Vince is a moron. Nope doesn't do much of a positive spin on gays.Surprisingly I found the American version (though I often think of it as being Canadian since it is shot in Toronto) much much much more interesting. The characters are more varied and the show covers all sides of the human dichotemy. And SURPRISE NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GAY!!!! I hope from the bottom of my heart that Showtime puts the entire first season on DVD."
2,They Really Liked This?,"Apparently all these rave reviewers can somehow get past the fact that the ""hot"" central character (Brian's counterpart in US version) is a very average looking guy. His pal (Michael's counterpart) is better looking. Okay, I don't want to be be a strictly superficial homosexual, but the central conceit of every plot line falls flat when there is no way to believe that this guy could really be picking up all those actually hot guys. With that major flaw in mind, all other credibility for the series goes right out the window... and even becomes laughable."
1,?,"Why do people like this? Its not like real life at all and in fact has done nothing but stain the reputation of hard working, moral, intelligent gay men."
2,Not as good as the American QAF serie,"The dialogs are almost the same, but the charaters are not as cute as in the american serie."
5,Simply a must-have item,"A dazzling combination of first-rate acting, tight dialog, and smart music. Its also great fun to see the commonalities and contrasts with the UK version offered here, and the derivative (and also excellent, perhaps superior) Showtime series here in the US. Positive and unflinching portrayals of gay life are still few and far between; don't pass this one by.Note: the DVD edition does not contain any additional content not available in the VHS edition (in fact, series 2 from the UK is still only available on video). The transfer is straightforward, clean, and letterbox. Choose DVD if it suits you, as the audio really comes across much better."
3,Buy the PAL version and have it converted to NTSC,"I also have the privilege of being able to watch the TRUE original version from the UK. Whilst, in essence, this is indeed the same series, I have noticed that the Canadian/US version does not have the original soundtrack and has deleted some of the scenes for content. This was truly disappointing. My personal recommendation would be to order the UK DVD and have it converted over to US DVD for around US$30 or have it converted to VHS for US$10. It's well worth the expense. Believe me."
4,A great series,"This DVD worked fine on my Pioneer multi zone player. This series reminded very much of the British series ""This Life"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. The main character in ""Queer As Folk"" was totally abnoxious and if he was any further up himself he would be tied up in a knot. A top cast and interesting storyline but if u are looking for full frontal in detail u will not find it here check out ""Beefcake"" and drool.......By the way the character Cameron is played by Aussie Peter O<Brien who use to star in ""Neighbours"" a popular Aussie soapie."
1,Get the Australian Version @ only 14.13 US !!!,"Yes, that's right! Because the exchange rate is almost 2 to one in the US's favor, you can get a GREAT DEAL!!!!28.26 for the entire first season of the UK version is a STEAL!!!The only drawback is that you MUST have a multi-region or region selectable DVD player for it to work. (I have a modified APEX-1500 and it works great!...."
2,no more,I love american version of QAF. british one is horrible. same story but UGLY actors /most of them/ can not even act! no special future on this OVERPRICED dvd. the best thing from this double dvd set is probably commercial for tv station. lol
4,Brilliant!,"I absolutely loved this DVD. Their Nathan gives our Justin a run for his money on looks! Their Stewart makes our Brian seem like a puppy dog. Their Vince has such a lovely sing-song accent that I could forget all about Michael!Ok, it's unfair to make these comparisons and I adore Sharon Gless but it had to be said. This is the original series (where Showtime got the idea) and it's well worth checking out. The only drawback is the lack of a scene selection menu so that if you're interrupted you have to FF through the whole bloody thing!I wish there were more stories from these boys!Oye! Fancy a shag?"
4,Not as good as you think!,this game is not as good as you think.i got this game and im at the end where you fight doc ock in the warehouse where is lizard?im almost done there is no lizard.no sign of him.lizard is not in any of the these systems ps2 xbox gc pc dont no n-gage dont no.gba has lizard you can see him on the back of the box.that sucks no lizard to fight for us.this game is short the average gamer should just take 20-25 hours beating this game.talk about being short.and when you save you dont end up at the place you saved you end up in a place you beat already!you shouldn't play this game if your under 10.some parts get to hard and frusterating.overall this game is alittle under OK.
1,A great game... Until you play it.,"Ladies and gentlemen be warned. This game is a popular series that has --until this point-- been very enjoyable. But Treyarch has seriously lost their touch. Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game, the ability to visit street level and foil ""everyday crimes"" around the city is awesome. But the ""level bosses"" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game. This game deserves no honors whatsoever, since the designers spent too much time trying to do ""cool"" things, rather than making it playable. Go back to the older Spiderman games and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more."
1,It ain't even out yet!!,"Sure, this game may very well turn out to be great, but we won't know UNTIL IT IS RELEASED. I wish Amazon would implement a policy that restricts our ability to rate products that aren't even out yet! Until then, I hope all of you reading this will use your brains and WAIT until you've played a game before you rate it. You may be giving a good review for a game that may disappoint you when you finally get a chance to play it. Do movie critics write reviews for movies they've never seen?"
4,TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"I GOT THIS GAME THE DAY IT CAME OUT. PLAYED IT AND OMG, OMG, OMG, WOW, WOW, WOW. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME OVER ANY XBOX GAME. AND BY THE WAY IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. GO BUY IT NOW!!(...)"
4,fun slinging,"the new web slinging engine is awesome.You control the momentome and who dosen,t want to jump off a huge building and then save yourself with web i smile to this :)"
3,Not that great,"Web swinging is a problem. I actually didn't mind web swinging from clouds in the first game. This one is tough and if the buildings aren't tall enough you end up on the ground while swinging.The side missions get boring after a while -- beat up some muggers, stop a car, rescue a guy from the roof. And when you complete a mission you immediately go to a screen showing your stats, interrupting the flow of the game.The graphics aren't that great. I had to rescue a guy hanging from a roof and it looked like he was hanging on by his chin; his arms were straight up with his hands well above the roof line. Peter Parker in the cut scenes has huge hands.The compass and height meters in the first game were more effective than the small arrows and height meters in this game.I like the smoothness of the fighting in the first game. This one is choppy and cartoonish.Overall a disappointment and waste of $50."
3,Hard but fun,"At first it was fun and when I got to Rhyno, I beat the crap out of him and it was so fun and I did it over and over again. I got to climb buildings and it was so fun. And I jumped off buildings, and I beat the crap out of bad guys. And it was so fun at the beginning, but when I got to the part where I had to go in the museum it was so hard, because I had to save the people in the time and then I had to get to the statue of liberty and that stinked. The parts where you swing up in the air and fall in the water was hard and I never got past the giant brain.Justin, 5 1/2 years(typed by mom)"
2,Way too short - good rental.,"I was very excited with all of the hype that this game out of the gate. Even the magazines were praising it. Unfortunately I bought into the hype and purchased the game without renting it first. Do yourself a favor and rent the game, once you get past the learning curve main story line is an easy solve.After the main storyline it is possible to keep playing to obtain additional hero points, but how many armor car high jackings does one actually want to stop."
1,Poor quality and non helpful customer service,"I would never consider recommending this company or the products they promote, I am dissatisfied with how this company does business! They refused to refund my money after the game I purchased for my son wouldn't play on his Xbox I assumed it was because the game wasn't a Xbox 360 version and asked for the 360 version they emailed me saying what I requested doesn't exist and ran down a list of years when the game came out as if I'm a game freak it was 3 or 4 days after Xmas when I contacted them,I asked if I can just swap it out for another game for my son at even price but they closed my claim and said my reason wasn't good enough for a refund. So now I'm out of my money during these hard times after the holiday's and my son is stuck with a Xmas gift he can't use I'm very disappointed on how they handled this situation"
1,HORRIBLE,"Everyone said that this new spiderman game was going to be great, so i bought it, it is one of the worst video games i have ever played. The graphics are terrible, it is impossible to control spiderman and the story sucks! there is not a single good aspect about the game that i found yet. Also despite the fact that you cant control spiderman i beat the game in about 5 hours.ONE OF THE WORST GAMES EVER"
1,"No Subtitles, Avoid this game","Beware, as with all Activision titles, the company fails to add the option for subtitles within their games, making them useless to those that need them. Spiderman 2 is heavily dependent on auditory instructions and interaction with characters throughout the game. Without subtitles...it is worthless.Avoid this game and all Activision titles until they get their act together."
3,BETTER THAN THE FIRST GAME.,"I love the way you can go anywhere in this game .But the mini missions are repetative.graphicaly this game is not so bad, but I have a ""S"" video cable for my XBOX ,which improves resolution. That is if you have a compatable TV. I think some younger kids might like this game better. All in all a good concept game but could've been better. Like More diverse side missions .And maybe you could talk to people on the street instead of the same cutscenes in the mini missions. This game is fun to swing around the city and see the day change into night with all the city lights is pretty kool.It'd be nice to play some of the other characters too."
4,addictive,"I was amazed at how smoothly the game ran considering how large and detailed the map out of Manhatten was. You can go almost anywhere and fight petty crimes or face of with super villians, such as Electro, Mysterio, and Ryno, while at the same time keeping up well with the plot from the movie. A fantastic rent and a good buy."
2,White trash is a long way from red velvet.,"Secreast's first book, THE RAT BECOMES LIGHT, was a witty and sometimes mystical exploration of the heart of small-town Appalachia, but this second book falls far short of that mark. Secreast's style has become ponderous for this second collection, and he seems to have lost some of the fundamental compassion for the characters. The people in this book have lives with little contour, less texture, and their stories are told without much deftness or vivid, memorable imagery."
2,"Nice earring, great price, but the metal turned a dark color","I purchased these earrings to match jewelery I bought while in the Caribbean. The first pair had a defective back and the store replaced them literally overnight. That's service! They are pretty little earrings. Unfortunately, over a few months time the metal on the earrings turned a dark color and no longer look like rose gold. ""I guess you get what you pay for!"""
3,A Little Disappointing,"This necklace was for a friend and I was surprised that it was somewhat larger than expected. Also, I ordered it before Valentine's Day and it arrived well after as opposed to many of the other items I ordered."
3,Just for Kids,"I'm that fish-out-of-water character -- an undergraduate grandfather. With but one exception, these monologues are all for teens. Next time I'll steer clear of such works labeled ""student"" even though students of theater come in all ages."
2,Too bad they found the trunk!,"At the risk of sounding totally mean, I have to say that there are some bright spots in this rather over-the-top and inflated score. No wonder it closed and was never recorded until now. It's just not as good as the publicity for the recording would lead you to believe. There's nothing original here, it's Broadway formula down to the first note of the overture to the end."
1,"""I love me, you love me, let's all serve my vanity...""","As reviewers search for reasons why this just isn't a terribly good disc, I submit that you can't gild a turd. And that the only reason this near-forgotten score has been revived is because it's a ***JAMES LIPTON VANITY PROJECT***. Lipton, best (and only) known for his execrable TV show (oh, wait! no, there were also those sterling Bob Hope Birthday Specials...), is, politely put, an undertalented lyricist and playwright. That his emetic program has afforded him enough (hopefully-brief) celebrity to coerce talented performers (all but one--Tommy Tune--have been dais guests of the oleaginous Lipton) to waste their time in the service of his ego is just another reason to regret ITAS' popularity.B'way completists rejoice if you will, but please also admit that there are many shows much more deserving of fresh recordings with marquee casts than this hacked-out pastiche of other creators' immeasurably-better work."
2,Some Turkey's Deserve Roasting,"Look, I don't want to spend time repeating all the very good bad reviews this show has gotten. I saw the original New York production just as Clive Revel (?) took over for George Saunders. There was only one reason I went to see it and only one thing that has stuck with me all these years: The sight and sound of Delores Grey singing the title tune. What a great voice! I was under the impression, from the PayBill, that RCA had recorded the cast album. But that was so many years ago, I could be mistaken. Still, that voice stays with me.Oh, if this company wants to do something to repent for this recording, release the original cast album of a little known show called Donnybrook! Eddie Foy, Jr; Art Lund; Susan Johnson. It is a musical of the Quiet Man."
4,SOUNDTRACK and CAST RECORDINGS,"Just a note:This is not a ""soundtrack"" as identified here. There is no track from which to take the sound. It is not a movie. It is a cast recording."
5,Spectacular talent,"A great album. Reminds me of another recently successful balladeer, Jamie Cullum. Spencer Day is easy to listen to, and this album is supported by super arrangements, perfect accompaniments and flawless mixing. The band and backgrounds are exactly right--never getting in the way of his magical voice and style, but inviting us to come in and listen, supporting the melody, but never interfering. Every track stands on its own. Spencer's treatment of Marty Robbins' Devil Woman took me a few listens to warm up to it (mainly because I was a big fan of Robbins), but all the other tracks hooked me at once."
1,NOT the soundtrack to the movie!,"I just want to make it clear that this CD is NOT the soundtrack to the movie ""The Edukators"". For some reason they've allowed the title of the movie to be attached as a label to this anthology of songs with little in common and none of which were featured in the movie. When the movie itself is such an intense statement against capitalism, it's pretty low to do this."
2,Coleman 70 quart ice chest.,"The coleman 70 quart Ice Chest does a good job. But like Igloo and others the hinges break very easily, poor vinyl or plastic material. In Texas Academy Stores usually have parts but Coleman parts are a low priority because Igloo is King. You will find plenty of Igloo parts even in other stores Hardware Stores, Target Stores, Walmart, but no Coleman parts. So forget buying a Coleman Cooler once the hinges break it is over. Go to Coleman's web site they don't even show a 70 quart cooler. Try and phone them and they don't even know what you are talking about and I provided the product number. I just gave up."
2,pick another style,"This pattern is not the Corelle's best. When it arrived, it looked like a cheap screenprint, with a strange texture. Part of the leaf was already scratched off. I gave it two stars because the base material of the plate is good."
5,Purify!,"I have experienced a Nyung Na fasting retreat using this book. It was GRUELLING, and afterwards I felt FANTASTIC! The prayers and prostrations along with the fasting is a beautiful ritual that softens the heart. Buddhist ritual all has a subtle purpose and effect on the mind, this one is no exception. This retreat leaves a person feeling cleansed."
4,An Excellent Resource,This book is a must for any undergrad in the Humanities. It covers many important thinkers and notes their contributions to the modern situation of the Western Intellectual Tradition. It is a great introduction to many of the most important thinkers and is a good starting point for research. A must read for Humanities students and recommended for just about any other area as well.
3,Size description is incorrect...,"The size of the side mounting is 5/8"" (not 3/8"" as described). Other than that it seems to be well built."
2,Disappointed,"This is not the old Intermatic K4021c Photo Control. I had one of these installed in a backyard pole light next to my driveway for 12 years, it worked great, coming on late dusk and going off at first light in the morning. This new product switches on way to early 30-40 minutes sooner in the evening and staying on equally long in the morning. 1-1 1/2 hours more electricity usage."
5,It works! Thats enough!,"I've had this new guy installed for about 3 months now... the cold wet and snowy months (Nov, Dec, Jan) and it's holding up just fine."
5,7 months and still running!,Installed mine per the directions and all went well. I use this to light my address light each night and it works perfect. I need to purchase another one for my side door light so I don't have to leave it on all day and night. More light is better keeping the thug azz criminals away from my house. But if they do try to come in I have miss SIG Sally 40 waiting too. ;))
1,Dismal,This was larger than I expected but it will fit in a standard outdoor box in any orientation thru a center-hole cover plate.-- However . . . I installed mine on a Sunday afternoon. It worked Sunday and Monday nights. That's all. I think $5/night and a 2-day life expectancy is beyond dismal.
4,Sound Premise,"You can see a version of this article on counterpunch.org or Znet.Just a small comment on the above review. The reviewer even fails to distinguish between nationality and religious affiliation -- when, in the reviewer's own words, ""Germany acts on behalf of the entire German people and Hungary acts on behalf of the entire Hungarian people"", that statement in itself transcends religion and speaks of nationality (Germans or Hungarians can be Christians, Muslims, Jews, Atheists, Agnostics, Buddhists, Sufis, etc.), but then he likens that with Israel acting on behalf of the entire Jewish population, oblivious to any problem in his example."
2,My 15-month-old had zero interest,"I got a good price on this, so I ordered it for my baby for Christmas. She hardly touched it. I thought maybe she was too old, but she was firmly in the recommended age range.After swiping at it a few times and pulling it once (at my insistence) it drifted to the corner, never to be played with again. I gave it to the Goodwill in like-new condition."
3,O.K,"Atlantis was O.K But easy to bet. You have three levels of skill you can choose from easy, medium and hard but it's still not that hard to bet on hard. It's not much a chalange but still a fun game to play"
4,Fun and challenging game for kids,"Trial By Fire is a fun and challenging game with 2 modes and 2 games. Multiplayer and Single Player (CD needed) It has cool 3D effects (But they could be better) and 2 challenging games to play. It includes the original ""Search For The Journal"" but the game has it's own disc and only the Search For The journal disc has the Keeper's CTF (Capture the Flag) and Tourney (Tournament) with Keepers instead of Atlanteans and no ""Stormtrooper Explorers."" This is a fun game that should keep kids age 7+ entertained."
3,"On balance, a valuable read","Mr. Malvin's criticisms are dead on. The book could have been shorter and tighter, and the cute word play is distracting (e.g., "". . . George Airy could not be so breezily toppled."").That said, the book was very interesting. I had not been familiar with the history. I had believed Einstein pulled an extremely radical notion out his hat. The book convincingly demonstrated why the theory of special relativity was ripe for Einstein's discovery at the turn of the 20th century. Also, I was not familiar with Poincare, who apparently was tantalizingly close to beating Einstein to the punch.Unlike some other reviewers, I did not think the book was overly technical. For people with no physics background (like me), the technical issues might have been further explained and explored."
3,At Last!,"True, the title of the book is a bit decieving, since it does not specifially talk much about Poincare's maps..and keeps the audience wondering and wanting more in that section. Similarly this is not a book to learn much about Relativity either. However, I think a book like such was much awaited. For the first time someone has done the folowing:1. Taken the mystic out of Einstien, and showed him a man of his time.2. Made us understand that why Einstien thought so persistently about simultaniety.3. How the Physicist Einstien was also a product of his training at the Patent office. This is an angle which no one touched before.The book is unique, and should be read by whoever is a good student of Einstien and his theories. As it does bring him out of the clouds, and puts him back on earth, and makes him human again. Which is a must have."
3,Unfocused,"There is a lot of interesting history here, showing that clock synchronization was a live and lively problem circa 1900. Unfortunately Galison never really tries to explain either Poincare's or Einstein's ideas. And in particular he never explains the connections between them. This is too bad whole point is how these ideas relate to each other and to the zeitgeist.The book is also too long, with too much repetition.It could have been so much better."
4,Informative but heavy,"This is a good book, but it is a challenge for the novice and too academically heavy handed for those without a passion for history. To be fair, I am more an avid reader of science, not of history, so I may not be the best judge. But the sometimes arduous case may for certain conclusions became tedious in various sections. I wasn't sure the author had made a clear decision about whether this book was meant to be science or history. Overall, well written and I'd say it is worth the effort."
3,Needs to be shortened,I am in complete agreement with several other reviewers that the book is overly long and redundant. It should have been edited to at least half its size. The last chapter is totally unnecessary. This is a shame because the basic material provides a unique perspective on the history of Relativity that is convincing and illuminating. I don't find fault with the technical level as some other reviewers and I believe the connections between Einstein's and Poincare's work is well made.
3,Good but too technical,"I enjoyed this book and learned a lot of history. But the Publisher's Weekly review got it right--the writing, attimes, *is* obtuse and overly technical. I would have prefereda more informal approach, leaving much of the details to a historical or scientific treatise."
4,Slow start,"This book gets off to a somewhat slow start, but is definitely worth the read. The connections in history and the physical adventures of scientists and technologists in the 19th Century are fascinating."
3,A better than average police/arson/murder thriller,"Often times, books that capture my attention, leave me eager to read more, and that entertain me make me quite happy. This book satisfied all those qualities and more. I found Beyond Recognition to be fast paced, gripping, albeit simple language. Pearson can craft a thriller well and left me eager to continue my read even if the book had a fair amount of predictability involved. If you enjoy thrillers involving police work you will be entertained by Beyond Recognition. -Angela Bernardon"
5,Gripping,I loved this book! Oh my gosh it was an edge of the seat - can't wait to find out what happens next - quickly turning pages book. Wow... another great book by Ridley Pearson and one that I will definitely add to my favorites list. I love Lou Boldt and the other characters and the plot has more twists and turns than.... Be prepared for some violence and descriptive moments and hang on to your seat!
3,Investigation--Great; Everything else--Not Worth It,"I have been a big fan of Pearson's work, so I grabbed this one out of habit. But I must say that I had a lukewarm reaction to the book. The subplot with the boy/psychic/Daphne was not very interesting to me. I know those sections were there to help move the plot along, but they were too predictable and boring, and they interrupted what I thought were the most compelling and heart-racing elements of the book: the pure investigation of the arsons by Boldt. Boltd's character, as always, comes across as one of the most believable in police fiction, a mix of determined desperation and fatalistic energy directed to help everyone else but himself. The book's villain disappointed me as well: without giving away anything, Boldt's nemesis did not seem as suitably sophisticated or malevolent as previous foes. Overall, if you're a Boldt fan, I'd say read the book and skip over the parts that don't really involve him."
3,GOOD BUT LONG!!!!!!!!,"This is the fourth Pearson book I have read. As in the first three the characters are great. I like Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. If Boldt does become a Lieutenant I don't think it will be as good. The character of Ben was very good. Would like to see him again as he grows up. Lets you use your imagination, you can just see the things as they happen. My reason for a three was the length of the book. Paper back--644 pages. I nearly put it down several times because I was past ready for it to be over. A lot of thought and feeling could have been left out. In my humble openion around 400 to 425 pages is plenty. If you like a good mystery that is very looooonnnnnng. You will like this."
1,Not up to his earlier workds- very disappointing,"Mr. Pearson's novels are headed in the wrong direction! The last three have gotten progressively worse. His books have always suffered from poor dialog, but his first three novels featured unique plots and carefully researched detail. His characters have become less believable, the details often don't ring true, and the dialog still is quite poor. What's happened?"
4,"One Of The Good ""Thrillers""","Ridley Pearson has been called the best of the ""thriller"" writers and he IS GOOD. Good characters, good plot, superior writing; Pearson has it all. Unfortunately he wrote a novel here that is too long for the plot. It gets tedious because the author STRETCHED the plot and spent much too much verbiage on a non-essential sub-plot of a troubled child. That is the only thing that stopped my giving this book five stars. If you are a reader of this genre, it is well worth your time. Tip: skip over a lot of the child stuff; you won't miss a thing."
2,I kept turning the pages...to find the good part.,"I like Pearson. He is better at character development than Michael Connelly. But with this particular novel, there is too much time spent in character development. And there are several characters, old and new. As a result, the book is big and fat, and the story moves slowly.It is not until towards the end that Pearson writes that it seemed like the next 24 hours flew by. That was a signal to the reader that we were finally going to get some action. And still it dragged. You might want to pass on this one."
2,A let-down,"Pearson knows how to create real tension and exciting situations. Some parts of this book are too drawn out, he often explains the obvious (at length), but overall it is quite an entertaining read. Minor problems for me are that the author describes Detective Boldt as extremely clever, yet somehow he misses a lot of clues. In addition, a lot of events are telegraphed, which for me is never really satisfying, but of course might be considered rewarding for other readers ('I knew this was going to happen..'). The worst part for me is clearly Pearson's naive and uncritical view of psychology and psychic phenomenon. This is not something I mind in fiction in general, but if a story is presented in such a realistic way, it just rubs me the wrong way. If you have a scientific background or are a critical thinker, this book will most likely be painful to read. Others will probably have a pretty good time."
4,Hypafix tape,"Bought this for my son to use with CicaCare dressing. Sticks for hours without peeling away from skin.Works great over CicaCare - held it in place, but leaves no residue on CicaCare when done.My son had some sensitivity to the adhesive, however."
4,"Nice DVD, wish it had 5.1 sound though","Martina looks and sounds great on this video DVD. The video format is 4:3 and the sound is only stereo, not surround sound.This DVD is a nice compliment to another Martina DVD I have, aptly titled Martina, because not a lot of videos overlap. This DVD also has the option of seeing her introduce and talk about the videos before they play, that's a nice touch.If you like Martina I'd highly recommend this DVD."
5,Excellent DVD Great Songs and Video,I really enjoyed this disc.Its not too often you get one that all the songs are great.It could have had a few more songs..but still worth the money.Martina's eyes are dreamy!Get this disc!
5,Martina needs to write Some of her own songs.,"With the passion and power that this woman delivers a song;can you even imagine if she coupled that with her(own)written lyrics? She also must update her Web Site more often. With the simple Beauty that she has, it's a terrible site with old (great though) photos and graphics. C'mon Martina Shake it up! -EZ"
2,Sadly missing her best and biggest work!,"Missing some of her biggest hits and best videos, not the least of which are Valentine, I Love You, Cry On The Shoulder Of The Road, and Blessed, which had to be in the can before this DVD was pressed.Hopefully a reissue later this year will correct such a glaring oversight as the absence of these tracks!"
3,Flavor was okay,The edidible water based & peach flavored massage oil was okay. Next time I would like to try a different flavor.
2,not what I thought,"This book has cute illustrations and writes each word in English and in Hangul (Korean) characters. I was dissapointed that there is no pronunciation guide for the Korean words. I was hoping to use this book to help my son learn a few words in Korean, but without any direction on how to pronounce the words, neither of us can actually say them. We do become more familiar with how the written language looks, but I was hoping for more."
3,After Spooky Tooth......,"Mike Harrison teamed up with local Carlisle band Junkyard Angel to produce this album in 1971. It is far from great, but listenable because of Harrison's strained soulful vocals and catchy melodies. I bought it because I'm from Carlisle and the only good music to ever come from this little northern England town was by VIPs/Art/Spooky Tooth. Mike Harrison's solo ventures were the end of this line and showed a steady decline after the peak of 'Spooky Two'. His next album, 'Smokestack Lightning', recorded (I think) with session musicians in USA sunk without a trace. I lost my copy years ago and have never replaced it. I last saw Mike Harrison serving drinks behind the bar of the Citadel Hotel in Carlisle sometime in the 80's. Sad."
3,"Probably very good book but not a ""general"" read.","This book is for a specialized reading group (professional musicians, advanced degree students, etc., but not for the general reader."
4,LOL ....no really LOL,I cracked up while reading this book...especially when she describes the different types of kids...ha! Didn't help me w/ a decision to have kids but it did give me a good laugh.
3,"Good, but harsh at times","I found this book to be funny but it was really hateful towards kids. Hence the title, ha ha. A lot of it is about how kids are annoying, such as on airplanes, but there were times where even I said out loud, ""sheesh, that's a bit harsh."" I do think children can be annoying some times (I think it's the parents' faults, but that's a whole other issue), but this book really stressed a true hatred for all things kid-related. If you are looking for a light and cheerful comparison book, I do not recommend this one."
3,Mildly Amusing; Was Expecting More,"Though she's covered all the child-free bases--and included a few good one-liners--the book just isn't that funny. There are a few great moments (""I Spy a Kid I Hate,"" page 64), but I was hardly buckled over by this book. If the book were consistently as funny as its cover photo, I'd give it five stars.And no, for those who were wondering: I'm not planning on having children."
2,It's okay,"The book wasn't that bad, I did laugh out loud once or twice. However, it seemed to me that she has an anger issue and sometimes it just came off as cruel."
2,Just not that funny,"Most of the discussion of this book centers around the controversy of hating or not hating kids. But that was completely lost on me.Because frankly, this book just isn't that funny.I wish I was like the reviewer who read it in the store in 30 minutes. 40 pages in, I think I laughed once. Frost offers nothing but the most pedestrian of observations on children. Her humor and venom is forced, rote, and predictable. She's trying to be the self-proclaimed leader of a revolution that she's neither qualified to lead, nor needs a spokesperson.Frost would have done much better condensing her overdrawn prose and repeated examples into a solid magazine article. As it stands, this book is about 130 pages too long. Good concept, uninteresting execution.And for those calling for a sequel about the parents? Please. Two unfunny attempts at the same subject would be over the top. Sort of like Police Academy II and III."
4,Funny,"I am almost done reading this book and it is very funny. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just read ""sippie cups are not for chardonnay"" which was one of the funniest books I have ever read so it got 5 stars."
4,Hilarious,"Every other page I was laughing out loud because the author is so witty. If you need a laugh, pick this up."
4,I have had this book for years,I ordered this book for a friend who expressed frustration with the fact she runs out of time every year and hates to see the holidays upon us. I'm hoping she will get as much out of this book as I have.
3,Good for taste of ELO,I am afraid I am too familiar with the originals and the songs seem rather odd out of their original album contexts.
4,Good Disc,"E.L.O always had a cathcy song.They were a cross between The Beatles&Queen.They have a cool sound as well.Can't Get it out of my Head,Don't bring me down etc.. still sound Good.E.L.O made a mark with their Music&Production."
2,"Oh, Please!","Normally I quite enjoy Marion Chesney's Regency romances. They often feature witty dialogue and absolutely hilarious secondary characters. This book features neither of these. Unfortunately, the heroine I found unsympathetic and the hero was quite dull. The only funny moments came from the little menagerie the heroine builds for herself, and those were few and far between. The overall tone of the story was lonely and disaffected. This isn't the best example of Chesney's work. To see her in much better form I would recommend any of the books in the School for Manners or Six Sisters series, which are all far superior to this one."
4,"A fascinating ""what if?"" debate about life and beyond.","John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, and Aldous Huxley all died on November 22, 1963. What if they all met after death, somewhere between heaven and hell? That's the premise of this engaging and intriguing book by philosophy professor Peter Kreeft.Written in the form of a Socratic dialogue, Kreeft's book casts Lewis as a Christian theist, Kennedy as a modern humanist and Huxley as an Eastern pantheist. The three interact and challenge one another's worldviews, examining and testing each other's beliefs to see what is true about life after death and the meaning of life.This book is ideal to read with a few other friends, be they believers, skeptics or seekers. It will provide lively discussion and ample food for thought."
4,my son loves it,my bee bee 1.5 years loves it. He loves to see me point at each of the trucks and tell him story about it.
3,ATR - Too Dead For Me is right...it's good but not great,"This cd seems to have 8 tracks by the listing but it's actually 5. The other tracks are ""noise"" tracks, basically you can use those for sampling, and they directly follow the main tracks, i.e. too dead for me, revolution action, and no remorse. The best tracks on this CD are definitely Too Dead For Me and No Remorse (Live in NYC). No Remorse is especially good because it has a grittier feel for it than on 60 Second Wipeout. Whether or not it was performed live w/Slayer or not I couldn't say. The Death of A President DIY track is 30 seconds of Hanin Elias babbling the intro to the song of the same name, though it IS fun too hear her say pussycat pussycat go go go....meoooooooow! The Anarchy 999 (real mix) is no different from the 60 Second Wipeout version and is only 7 seconds longer according to my cd player (i checked it) which ends up being 7 seconds of miscellaneous static. Buy this CD just to say you have all of them!"
4,An oldie but very much a goodie!,"I'm not sure if it is because this is a slightly older book or what but this novel grabbed me more than other more recent ones by Saul. In fact, the second half grabbed me and seemed to be quickly tying together many things that I didn't even think would be connected but ended up being so. It was definitely a page-turner! Saul still keeps with his theme of children and revenge but there is a little bit more of a bite in the story. The story contains some grit that makes it that much more enjoyable. My only complaint is that I know I read the last page somewhere else. Not sure if it was another novel by Saul, by someone else or if I just read the book twice by mistake, but it was definitely familiar."
2,Missing something,"This book wasn't terrible, but it seemed to be missing something. Some sort of ""OOMF!"" I guess after reading Bentley Little's books, John Saul isn't as exciting.""The Unwanted"", to me, dragged along. I found myself skipping pages to get to some action."
4,"not deep, but funny","I've read the previous reviews, and I agree that the characters are two dimensional, but I enjoyed the book a lot anyway. The descriptions ARE funny and engaging. The characters aren't really the POINT of the book, it's about a lifestyle, and I had trouble putting it down. I disagree with the reviewer that found the writing poor; I think the writing is great for what it is, the choice of wording ofter perfect. Comedies don't usually examine character in depth!"
3,Mildly entertaining,"First let me say that I did enjoy reading this book, but there are a couple of points of which I did find disappointing. The characters in the story are rather bland and two dimensional; it is really hard to care either way as to what happens to each person. I do not feel that much thought was given to the plot in that it is fairly straight forward and very much predictable. Despite these short comings, the few humorous situations and quips were enough to hold me till the end of the book."
3,Humor only a geek would love,"The first paragraph grabbed me when I read it in the store -- possibly the best book beginning since A Tale of Two Cities. OK, maybe not quite that good, but imagry so strong I occasionally pull it off the shelf just to read that paragraph.One reviewer thought only Silicon Valley residents would enjoy this book. I disagree. I've been through the Valley only twice, and that was on a shuttle bus. I will say that anyone associated with IT will enjoy this book. A few good plot twists that only a geek will understand.Don't look for Broadway quality humor. But if you're a nerd, buy this."
3,Good book-too technical,"Perhaps it deserves 4 stars, but reading this book would have been more enjoyable for me if I was able to empathize with the technical people--I am not technical in any respect. The story was fun and characters good, but not completely understanding the jargon of WHIP or other computer technical things hindered my enjoyment and caused the reading to go slower."
5,"If you are involved in high tech in Silicon Valley, you should read this","If you work in high tech, entrepreneurial type things or if you live in Silicon Valley or if you once lived there, you can definitely enjoy this. It is very entertaining.Although this covers the dot.com bubble, it is also relevant to this current fourth wave of Silicon Valley high tech growth.If you take the 1st wave as the growth of the early semiconductor companies around and spun out of Shockley, then the 2nd as the rise of Apple/XeroxPARC/SAIL, and the 3rd as the internet and dot.com period. We are probably in a 4th wave of Social Networking.Anyway, this story is still relevant and highly enjoyable."
1,Crap,Really not impressed. There are a ton of better designs out there and it takes up way too much room. Definately worth the cost.
3,"Well, it is what it is.",I love Tom S. More for his special make-up effects than acting. This movie is one to have for collectors of horror-but over all I expected it to be much better.
4,Medium works for a women's size 9,"After reading the reviews about how these ran small, I decided to order a medium for my women's size 9 shoe. They fit great.So far, so good on these - they are well made and comfortable. My feet are warmer now in my old drafty house with especially cold floors so I am very grateful.I like how they are enough like socks that I don't have to take them off when I curl my feet up on the couch."
4,SUPER Socks,Extremely comfortable and warm. I'm a little nervous about washing them and not ruining the soles. Would give five stars if they cost a little less.
1,Tourniquet,"The wool shoe part is lovely and warm and stretches. The same is true with the wool ankle part. But someone FAILED TERRIBLY in the design because where the two parts are joined, the heavy stitching does not stretch and is so tight it feels like a tourniqet and after ten minutes there is a deep compression mark left on your instep. This is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted. Wearing them for any length of time leads to foot pain. I tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail. What a shame. And yes, these are my correct size in every other way. A good idea but worthless because the construction wasn't thought through enough. Go back to the drawing board Muk Luks Company,I would really like these if you got it right."
3,Not the Original Mukluk,"I have a pair of the original Mukluk and have enjoyed them over the years. Time had come to replace them. The tag that comes attached calls these the ""original"" Mukluk, they are not. They are warm, but as another reviewer mentioned the sock part only covers the ankle, the real original Mukluk covered the calf another 4 inches. When I purchased these I ignored his review, but now I wish I had not. On this cold morning I am wearing socks with my Mukluks to get some leg warmth. Next time I will try another brand, unless they forget the current ""original"" and revert to the ""classic"" Mukluk."
3,"great product, impossible to get right size","Very pleased with the service and the product, BUT, it was the wrong size! You need a degree in advanced mathematics to figure out their sizing charts. Too bad. The product is wonderful but we had to send it back because we don't know what the right size is!!"
3,"They are nice, but not the same product my husband likes","These are very nice. My husband wears them around the house, but there is another brand he likes better. If we can't get them, he likes this one 2nd best."
2,Good quality/design but too small,"I really wanted to like this product, but I couldn't get it on my foot. I figured a medium (which supposedly accommodates a size 8.5 to 9.5 shoe) would fit my size 9 foot. I was wrong."
3,too small,I wanted a 9 1/2 size and was sent a 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 which makes it tight on the toes. If I had known that I would have ordered a large. I know i could send them back but that is a hassle. That is why I don't like buying on line
5,Blood Thinner Customers,"A friend of mine, who is on blood thinners, always has cold feet. A pair of socks and slippers weren't enough to keep his feet warm. THESE SLIPPER-SOCKS DO THE JOB! They're snug (but not too snug at the ankle to cut off circulation) and comfortable."
4,REALLY warm,"My fiance likes the fit and comfort, but sometimes he has to take them off because they are soooo warm."
3,Shoes warm cold feet,Helped my cold feet. Wearing out quickly.I cose these on the mistaken idea that they would always keep my feeet warm when in the home. It turns out that poor circulation is part of the problem.
2,slippers,The knit top wraps around the sole. Seems they would wear out quickly. Also seam where ribbing attached to the foot is tight.
3,Not like the muk luks I remember.,"The service was excellent. However, the overall size seemed a bit too small for the labeled size (large). Also, the sock portion was not very long, barely covering my ankle. Forty years ago, the socks were longer, up to mid-calf. (The illustration is accurate, I just wasn't paying attention.) I guess I should have tried a different brand."
3,Not a Flag,"I wish sellers who sell flags would tell you if they are printed on BOTH sides. A Flag is printed on both sides so it can be flown. This is a Banner, Printed on ONE side so all you can do is hang it on a wall"
2,display quit after a year,"This was a good system with all the features we wanted in a phone until the display on one of the handsets went blank. This happened just a little more than a year after purchase (hence, after the limited warranty ran out as well). E-mail to Panasonic support resulted in regurgitation of what can be found on the Web site and offered no resolution. For the price of the system, I would expect the phones to last much longer than a year; a replacement for one handset from Panasonic will cost another $44 plus ""tax and recycling fees."""
3,Panasonic TG 6073 cordless phone,"The phone arrived quicker than promised and was easy to configure for my needs. The phone covers the needed area and provides good voice quality. However I did have a problem with one of the handsets not charging the battery properly after about 3 weeks of ownership. It is a real chore to get assistance over the phone since the website did not have an answer to my questions or problem. Phone contact is difficult because the voice prompts were not relative. When I finally spoke to someone I was cut off two times while waiting for the representative. When I finally reached the representative they were helpful but were hard to understand. They spoke with a thick accent that was difficult for me. I suppose this experience is representative of all major companies today, but is rather exasperating. The set is well built and easy to use and I do not regret purchasing it. If I had not had this problem, I would rate it 5 stars."
1,Not a genuine Autobiography,"If you're looking for the 50's edition, this is not it. It has no forward or publishing information at all. The cover looks like it was done in Microsoft Paint in about five minutes taking a thumbnail from Google Images. The margins are about an inch and a half on all sides. The print is fairly large. Don't be deceived by the inexpensive price thinking, ""Hey, I can save a ton!"" It's not what you want, get something else."
2,mehh,it was okay. it was not really the content i was looking for and the typist for the ebook really sucked. skipped spaces every 2 words like clock work
3,First versus Second Edition,"A decent text introducing at least the basic framework for philosophicalpositions to those without a lot of philosophy background. Nice to useas a secondary text supplementing primary texts. One things to make sure of, however; get the second edition and not the first. I ordered a used edition thinking that it would be the second edition as Amazon has grouped it. It wasn't however. The first edition's last chapter is on feminism whereas the second's is on school reform. I am now going to have to order another one because of Amazon's screw up!"
2,Dewey's a God,"If you like Dewey, you will like this book. In this book Dewey is a God. In the first chapter as the author reviews different philosophers, he keeps going back to Dewey. There were parts where I was confused because I didn't know if the author was referring to Dewey or another philosopher."
1,Watch out for the printing fault,"My copy of the 2nd Edition contains a large section of pages that have been duplicated and the pages that should be there are missing. The book seems good other than that, but check your copy for this fault immediately upon delivery. I would have given it a good rating if not for this fault."
3,"MOVIE IS ONLY SO SO, BUT THE MUSIC IS INCREDIBLE!","DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THE SOUNDTRACK, IF THERE IS ONE?I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE!"
2,Just didn't kick off.,"Well, it wasn't a horrible movie, it just seemed to fall flat. The acting was alright, but it wasn't enough. The humorous parts weren't funny. The characters didn't have much depth. It failed to do what a decent chick flick is supposed to do, which is tug on your emotional strings. I'd have to say pass on this one, unless your a really big fan of one of the actors."
1,Not as good as I suspected,"The movie Dog Park was not good at all. I found myself crying in the theatre when I wanted it to end. The acting is terrible with the exception of Luke Wilson. The humor was stupid and unfunny It seemed that when the writer ran out of jokes he/she started to use slap stick and over used phrases.Most of the jokes have been heard in other movies, so the movie could be called ""Dog Plagerism"" I would not recommend this movie."
5,Pfaltzgraff Naturewood Serenity Tableware Pattern,I love this pattern because it is versatile and timeless.
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,I have been buying products from Amazon.com for a while and this is the worse product I ever bought. I got the pair on sale. I'll never ever by cheap cheap products with cheap cheap price eve ever again.
1,dumb chocolate,"This fake chocolate has a very small hole that you are supposed to put water in to squirt it at people. But it is VERY hard to do. So if you buy this chocolate, your just buying plastic chocolate."
4,Sadly in B&W.,"The comics as originally published were in color, not black & white (the first customer-reviewer may've been thinking of the 1960s Warren comics magazines such as CREEPY), and it's a pity that this series didn't replicate the colors, garish as they sometimes were."
3,Not the best,"I am in the USMC and deployed to Afghanistan so I get what boot socks should to... these are average for boot socks. The Fox River Retardant version are awesome, a little more expensive but well worth it!"
3,"too narrow, but nice sock","don't know if they will hold up. they are so tight, they seem like support hose. Not sure how they will hold up when the stretch out. nice quality, though.Hey Fox River, think Bamboo, please."
2,Don't stay up,. I wear with boots. They do tend to work their way down my leg after a while. The whole reason for boot socks is to stay up. They don't. Also a bit too thick. As they go down they bunch up at the toe. Will not buy again.
4,Excellent overview of verb tenses and conjugations,"This program is a continuation of the 8 hour italian introductory course by Michel Thomas. While the initial course concentrated on giving you enough background to string thoughts and sentences together, this course emphasizes the understanding and command of verbs and verb tenses. Learning languages, any language, is a continual process of ever widening exposure and usage. Learning and understanding the verbs is probably the most important element of beginning to gain mastery. This course gives an excellent foundation towards that goal, and Michel Thoma's insights into the mechanics and structure are both good and interesting, which makes the process much more enjoyable. To date, the editions for these CD's come from the United Kingdom."
1,Good Luck Getting Your Money Back,"I canceled this service contract, since I returned the item. Despite two letters, several phone calls, and a 30-day refund window under State law, I have yet to receive a credit. Their representatives have given me no less than three different ""refund procedures"" and two alternate PO boxes. Amazon wants nothing to do with them as far as refunds go - they just sell the plan. However, since Amazon billed the credit card, I've asked the bank to deal with it. I wonder if N.E.W.'s product service, should you ever need it, is on a par."
2,Dispensable,"I got this plan but NEVER had the need for it. Apple has excellent customer service, this plan is an extra bonus but not crucial nor does it exclude the support you get on location of through Apple phone support."
3,Here's an idea,"After reading the review by ""An electronics fan"" I decided not to buy this item, right away.Since you have up to 30 days after your purchase to add the warranty, I decided to wait.If I keep the item, I can add the warranty later. If I don't keep the item, then I don't have to hassle with NEW's Customer Service.Also, I was supposed to get a $30 credit for applying for the Amazon credit card, but that has not gone through yet... I was going to use that to pay for this."
3,THE STARTING LINE,"This old book [1975] has information about the American Colonies, the American Revolution, and the Constitution. There are also maps and charts on over a dozen pages."
4,Incredible buy; incredibly relaxing,"2 CDs for next to nothing, how can you beat that? The music is VERY relaxing--great background music, fine for meditation too. Versatile Telemann."
1,Not worthy,"This book was left at one of those free book exchanges, now I know why. First, there was a typo in jacket sleeve, identifying the goal of the colonists as being Titan not Tritan, so I started confused. I struggled through incomprehensible technology, self-indulgent introspection (in the form interminable flashbacks), almost no narrative and constant sexual encounters. Finally, still struggling at 150 pages I decided to go online to see if I was the only one who had trouble with this book, apparently not. I love science fiction, but this is just a high tech book about sexual fantasies, with characters not even mothers could love. Just because it's in space doesn't mean it should be called science fiction. These are explorers who live in holograms, scientists with no curiosity or scientific methodology. Save your money, save a tree don't bother with this book. Pick up something by Pohl, Bradley, Niven, Bradbury, McAffrey, Bova, Clark, Asimov or LaGuin and explore."
4,Disagree,"..I found Iris to be a compelling read, and its characters to be a fully realized set of people with foibles, problems, neuroses, and -- gasp -- sex lives.That is not to say that Iris is pornographic; far from it. But the character are adults, and the book manages to convey a sense of the tangle of personalities that would result from the extended close contact of ten people on a lengthy interplanetary flight.And then, on top of all that, comes a VR encounter with an alien intelligence! A worthwhile read, no question about it."
1,Not worth the time,"First, I have to say that I rarely start a book that I do not finish. I only made it through 14 pages of this book. I checked it out from the library so had no reason to put myself through the torture that these reviews obviously indicate would not have ended until I stopped reading this book.In only fourteen pages, I was both disgusted by the prolific sexual content and completely confused by the scientific jargon. I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my eyes on those measly fourteen pages."
1,Can't make it past page one.,"When the book starts with one guy going down on another, I stopped at this point. I bought this in the sci-fi section of the store. Maybe I was really in the gay porn section."
1,Not a Good Read,I'm a hardcore SF fan the authors seem too interested in the physical lives of there characters. I like the premise of the novel but I wouldn't recommend this book.
1,"Very poor editing, easy to put down.",The story was barely good enough for me to want to even know how it came out. There was a lot of superfluous stuff that I just plain skipped over. The authors tried I guess to make the characters interesting but most were so offensive to me that I didn't even want to know about them. That was too bad because most of the story seemed to be about all the little personal foibles and problems that the group of oddball characters had rather than science fiction. The other problem I had with the novel was that the techno-babble was not at all believable. But somehow I got through the novel and am now able to move on to something much better. I certainly will not be reading anything by those two authors again.I think the editor deserves a good part of the negative criticism I have for this novel. The novel should be much shorter.I don't recommend this novel.
2,Blech...,"Iris has an interesting theme, but it is just not executed well. The authors seem to be overly obsessed with the character's sexual lives, as there is such an encounter every 3 pages. Overall, I can't recommend this book to anyone in good faith."
1,Iris Is A Hideous Mess,This is arguably the worst science fiction novel I've ever read. The characters are so wholly unsympathetic and cold that I found the few redeeming qualities of the hard science disappeared. I wanted the book to end within the first few pages. Run. Run fast and far.
2,Buy the larger copy!,"This book has very small print. My friend has the normal book size. This one is just to little. Kinda just bought it quickly and didn't read all the details on the dimensions, so make sure you buy the bigger print!"
2,the joy of sex,"The book was good, but reading was difficult because the print and photos where very small."
1,forever boring,"I've read a few different LE Modesitt jr novels now. I'd have to say that this set is the worst so far. I can't say that the author made me really attached to the 'hero' Gerswin. However, it was the pace of the books which really bogged me down. They are *slow*. It takes forever for anything of note to happen. In the end I just gave up and put these books down to a waste of money and a bad buy."
1,Forever Sociopath might be a more appropriate Title,"A hero? I don't think so. I read this book because I so enjoyed Gravity Dreams but I was appalled by Modesitt's concept of a hero. After killing several people that the main character decides may not have deserved to die he concludes ""live and learn"". We've got lots of people on death row who have done much less than this character who would like to get off with a ""live and learn"" defense. It was at this point I threw the book away; something I have never done in the 40 odd years I've been reading science fiction."
3,Modesitt writ large,"Modesitt has a style of writing and a type of character that he has successuly spun and respun into many different books. This series follows the mode of the others. Everything one loves about Modesitt's writing is there- good sci-fi cowboy adventures in space. Everything one hates about Modesitt's writing is there- formulaic writing, longer sentences that this one, and hammering on current populist themes (how mankind ruined the earth and, unless controlled closely, will despoil the universe in it uncaring lust for more materialism.. blah blah blah). Unbelievely long and tedious, but then again, I knew that going in, and I still read Modesitt!"
4,Machiavellian comes to mind...,"The book is worth reading.... It will make you think. It will make you angry. It will bore you at times. I know I'm being vague, but this is a LONG book. Flawed hero is an understatement. If you like to be challenged; pushed to think; then you'll probably like this book. It's certainly NOT for everyone.A final note: as another reviewer indicated, ""It is not appropriate for most children""."
1,Definitely Not Perfect,"I recently have become very interested in this case and I've read about four books on it and have watched film and read transcripts etc. I had seen this movie when it first came out on television but watching it now and knowing all the facts, this movie is just used to make Scott look worse than he actually was. The Amber Frey calls were ridiculously off, along with the basic facts. Dean Cain, like everyone has previously said, did an amazing job and it's amazing how much he looks like scott. After reading almost everything there is to read about Scott, I'm bothered by this film because it is very one sided. The questions ""Tommy"" asked were legitimate and it seemed like that was the only time they let you doubt that Scott was guilty but in the end ""Tommy"" looked stupid.I certainly just wish the movie was a little more factual and not so one-sided."
2,This is a dramatization...NOT a documentary.,I thought this was a documentary when I purchased it. My mistake...but wanted to share that. This is a simple dramatization with actors portraying the Peterson & Rocha familys. For anyone highly interested in this case...you will probably enjoy the movie.
5,Horror on Xmas Eve!,"Based on the shocking events of 2001 tragic christmas for the Peterson family and the formal accusation of Scott Peterson, his husband, as a suspect.Magnifically starred by Dean Cain (I can?t believe it?s not scott).The only thing that disappoints me about this movie, is that scott cames up to be INNOCENT!! Eventhough we all suspect he killed her!!His performance is really awesome. This is not a funny movie, nor a children?s movie."
2,Ive seen better,"Movie was okay. Skipped a lot of evidence, like a low budget movie. the director must have been in a hurry to finish it. didnt really go in order or tell how laci was killed. thru out the whole movie everthing points to the husband. not very good acting either."
4,Perfect Husband Laci Petterson Story,I liked it and thought it was good up to the end. Thats before he was convicted on Death Row.
3,"Pretty Good, Could Have Been Better","Dean Cain was very good in his role of Scott Peterson, portraying his selfishness, his neurotic sense of self-control and his sociopathic disregard for his wife Laci.I think the movie could have been stronger in several ways. the character of Laci could have been developed to a greater degree giving the viewers more of a feel for the full tragedy of her death. Laci's parents also lacked a completeness. They were too dumbed down for the lowest common denominator TV watchers.Amber Frey's portrayal was good, but I wish they would have shown more about how she and Scott first met and how he managed to never mention his wife. Peterson was portrayed very well as a slimey manipulator with more love of his orgasms than other people who get in the ways of his plans."
3,check out court tv tripping all over themselves,obviously court tv wanted to be the first to make a movie about the whole scott peterson affair and they succeeded admirably...however they could have 1. waited until the outcome of the trial 2. re-enacted what if was like when laci was alive. There is nothing about laci in the whole movie which I think is pretty damned odd. I think much time was spent focusing in on Scott Peterson but is sociopathic tendencies are left out and had there been more time that went by we could see a more accurate movie with inclusion of everyone that was involved. I liked the movie but didn't see it until after the trial...I think we need a do-over.
3,Product,"Very disappointed in the movie. Acting was horrible, depiction was inaccurate (from what I've read) expecially by Sharon Rocha who I would say had a 1st hand awareness of how things went down. I felt movie was hurriedly made without indepth research. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Amazon picture mis-represented product,"The product was pictured on the Amazon page in original Remington packaging. The product I received was in a small plastic generic package, clearly an after-market product (possibly refurbished/recycled). I feel Amazon and seller mis-represented the product.Foil & Cutters fits Remington SP-282 Intercept"
4,Exactly what I needed.,"This part was for my Remington Shaver and is not a part that you find on any store shelf. The nearest store I know of that has this part is over 20 miles. Although I thought shipping was a little high, even with shipping it came out to be a better price than the cost of gas plus the cost of the item."
5,Poor Liz,"This is my first time I read this book( The Phantom Prince)and I found out that Liz is such a stupid woman. In fact I don't want to say more except Liz is silly and foolish woman. She didn't understand the whole thing.She engrossed all the same in every page I read and she is not professional writer at all. Her book was telling the story after it was too late.She wanted people to feel sorry for her, but I don't feel sorry at all.If she wanted to protect her daughter and their privacy, she would never dare to disclose all her private secrets, but she is still stupid woman.I know that most of people will never respect and appreciate my opinion, but I understand how they feel."
1,"Movie ordered, never received","We never received the movie, nor did we receive refund of payment. We contacted vendor via email, but they never responded!"
4,WOw!!,"Never saw the first but I really liked this one, makes me want to see the first now. Keira Knightley isnt bad to look at either!"
5,Great film !,Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is great film to add to pirate film collection. Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead man's chest is better than Pirates of the caribbean : Curse of the black pearl. Number 1 was OK. But Number 2 is very good. I can't wait untill the 3rd and final moviePirates of the Caribbean : At World's end to arrive to theaters. Be ready for Att world's end. Barbosa sosen't know whta ihe is in for.
3,Not as good as the first,"But then again, few sequels are. Still worth watching, but I wouldn't pay $20 for the DVD."
4,Fun For The Family,"Excellent movie that does not get 5 stars from me since it has a ""cliffhanger"" ending...this DVD is loaded with extras..Disney did not disappoint in the production values of the DVD...and why would they knowing it will be the biggest seller of the year?, and will only whet peoples appetite for POTC 3 AWE which is coming out in May...spend the extra 5 bucks and get this 2 disc version...If you are a Pirates Fan you will love all the extras on the second disc"
3,"decent, yet weird action scenes","I was never a fan of these Pirates of the Caribbean movies. I mean, they have plenty of exciting and distinct scenes that make the movies stand apart from other pirate films, but trying to follow along to any kind of plot is a very difficult thing to do. What was going on throughout the movie? Why were certain fight scenes happening? What were those giant worms that were popping out of the water and attacking the ship? I guess the overall weirdness is supposed to be unique to the viewers, and the reason the series caught the attention of millions, but, I don't know. I'd just like to know what was going on.Also, I'm not a fan of the way the movie comes off like I'm watching a play. Seriously, it's like the whole time I was sitting in the audience watching Johnny Depp do his typical weird pirate mannerisms on a giant stage. That's kind of a turn off."
4,"Good, but not Great","Story = C+Acting = BSpecial Effects A-I heard such great things about this movie, I guess I expected too much. It was NOT as good as the first one and I too would give that movie 4 stars and if I had a choice, would give this one 3.5 stars. While I am a fan of these type sci-fi movies, I never liked Jonny Depp as Jack Sparo because I felt he WAY overacted. Everyone else thought he was great, so what do I know? Overall this was a fun watch, but I doubt I'll watch it again any time soon."
2,pretty awful.,"Compared to the first one, this second Pirates has lost all of the humor, all of the glory. As hilarious as Johnny Depp was in the first one, this is just overdone. Every single character has a different plotline, even the dog. Definitely not worth the price. Let's see if the third one redeems it."
5,"Great! , but it could of Improved.","My real opinion of the movie that it is four in a half stars. The ending was entirely unexpected.Most of the humor carried a bit too far and most of the cannibal part was stupid.I also first thought in the trailer that Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)shot Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)and made him fall.Also I did not like when Elizabeth Swann (Keria Knightly)kisses Jack.The things I like this movie is that people in the first one I hated are OK now.I pity most people in this movie except Davy Jones (Bill Nightly)and Lord Beckett (Tom Holland).In general,this movie one of the best movies I have watched."
3,"Ok, but too long","After seeing that horrible Part 3 of the ""Pirate"" series, I was hesitant to watch this one.Have to say, it was good. Not as good as the original ""Pirates"", but much better than the third one.Only complain is the movie, at 2 1/2 hours, is too long."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean 2,"Definitely my favorite in the series. The only sad thing is that after seeing this one, I had overly high expectations for the final one, which in my opinion, it failed to live up to."
3,Fun (for those who don't upchuck easily),"Actor and action-driven entertainment, it's biggest problem is it's only half a movie. Also, it's not for small children or those with queasy stomachs--the fantasy computer-graphics are a bit too realistic (gross!--or cool! depending on the viewer). Regardless, lots of fun--thank you Mr. Depp."
4,And a Bottle of Rum...,"I just got this in the mail today and it is in awesome condition. I was so excited when I got it. I loved the movie in theaters, and so having the opportunity to own it myself and watch it whenever I want is very nice. It skipped only once and only for a tiny amount of time, nothing to freak out over certainly. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied. :)"
4,Great Continuation.,"Pirates of the Carribean, Dead Man's Chest does a great job of continuing the trilogy. This movie is action packed full of adventure.Johnny Depp does an exemplary job of playing Captain Jack Black. And, I could not possibly pry my eyes away from the handsome face of Orlando Bloom. This all star cast, makes this movie even better.I must say, I cannot wait to see the third movie. Dead Man's Chest left many stones unturned. Argghhhhh....Matey."
4,"Fun and Exciting Still! But Not as good as ""Black Pearl""","I saw PoTC: Dead Man's Chest on opening day in LA and fought my way through 1000 teenage girls. The movie is fun and exciting. The story is good. Johnny Depp doesn't disappoint, nor does any of the other cast. One problem is being able to hear what people are saying half the time. The English accents combined with broken English (or bad English) had everyone in the theater looking around at each other and shrugging, trying to figure out what they said (especially in scenes with the lady in the treehouse).But overall it's a solid, fun movie, I can't argue that."
3,Not so good,"I just couldn't get interested in the movie. There were 2 parts at the beginning that got me a laugh. But the dialog was inane, the action slow and the plot didn't make a lot of sense. I know sequels usually don't do well and this one didn't.I was so bored that I fell asleep 20 minutes into the movie and my family just switched it off about 10 minutes after that because they couldn't stand it either."
3,not as good as the first movie.,I thought it was ok my husband loved it.It was way to long and didnt keep my intrest. But my husband loved it so I geuss to each his own.lol
4,Cliffhanger,"It is a worthy sequel to the first movie. They keep a host of well-rounded characters and introduce several more. The special effects are incredible and you are left wanting to see how things turn out.I didn't quite get why they reintroduced Barbosa, but we might find out in the next edition.In addition to the mystical elements of the first part, one is treated to a subtle diatribe on the evils of corporations and the strangle-hold they've had on governments for hundreds of years.All in all, it is an exciting picture that might scare young children, but is mostly fun for the entire family. If you liked the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. If you didn't, then don't even bother."
1,This is a terrible movie,"The constant references to the first movie was stupid, not allowing the movie to stand on its own. Worse was how Depp ruined the Sparrow character. There was no intelligence or shrewdness behind it. I didn't even like the Sparrow he portrayed in this disaster. Depp and Knightly grossly overacted. The only redeeming quality was Orlando Bloom who did well with nothing to work with. The special effects were so far over the top it looked fake. So pale compared to the first movie. The more I think about Pirates 2 the less I like it."
2,confusing,"Unless one watches the original film before the sequel, one will be completly lost. I found although I loved the atmosphere and flavor of this flick and all it's actors of whom are superb, the plot jumped everywhere and was pretty hard to follow. It is not the type of film to analize too much because it will give one a headache trying to figure out all the twists turns and sub plots. It is just too much. I became frustrated and bored and couldn't even finish it. Kids will like it for all the action sequences... but I would not recomend to buy it. Rent it first before you make your decision"
3,FIRST PART WAS A LOT BETTER,NOT A BAD MOVIE BUT TO MUCH SCIENCE FICTION IN IT. IT GETS A LITTLE BORING AND CHANGE THE THEME COMPLETELY. I PREFER THE FIRST MOVIE BETTER. THAT ONE WAS A 5 STAR RATING.
2,Just Okay.,"The main reason this sequel is not as great as the original is that it felt dragged, it didn't feel as fun and it was more predictable than the Curse of the Black Pearl."
1,Not a good follow-up.,"I loved the first POTC film. It was a masterpiece in story, effects, and acting. This film (along with A.W.E.) just did not have the same feel of the first, nor a plot that I got into. I'm just not a fan of this film. It deserves only one star for some good acting and special effects. My recommendation is that you stick with the original and not see the sequels."
3,A downhill movie from the first,"I really loved the first Pirates movie, so naturally I was really looking forward to this. I will be honest, I was pretty disappointed. It felt like the same jokes and lines that were awesome in the first one were just used all over again, making it pretty boring and uncreative. The length of the movie was just outstandingly long too. I got bored in it, while seeing other long movies like Return of the King or Gladiator were fine because they were great with their plot. This was like they came up with a bunch of good action scenes, and wrote a script around them.All in all, it didn't suck, but it wasn't great. I got it for Christmas, and I enjoyed it a second time through more than the first. I just wish they would have tried to make it better, instead of just spending lots of money to make lots more money."
5,Best Freaking Movie Ever!,"tHIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER! noTHING WILL EVER TOP THIS! i LOVE THE HUMOR AND ADVENTURE IN IT AS WELL AS THE ACTORS. iT JUST REALLY MAKES THE MOVIE FABULOUS. jUST TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. YOU 'RE MISSING OUT ON LIFE IF U DONT SEE IT SO SEE IT!!!!"
1,Nowhere as good as the first one,"I really enjoyed the first ""Pirates of the Cribbean"" but ""Dead Man's Chest"" was terrible. There was very little plot and it was confusing."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I loved the first POTC, which is why I bought this sequel. I was expecting a much higher quality movie - at least as equal as the original. Man, was I mistaken! Many of the scenes were shot without sufficient lighting - like in, dark. The use of physical comedy almost reminded me of old, low-quality slapstick. Not what I expected.Having said this, I was rather intrigued with the possibility of yet another sequel. When that comes out I'll probably slap the cash down and buy it too. I just hope I get my money's worth this time."
1,if I could give zero stars...,"Anyone looking for awful racial stereotypes? Be my guest and get some very bad entertainment including all socially perpetuated prejudices. The white man saves the day while defeating the backward and man-eating native cultures, as well as outsmarting the treacherous Indians (and I mean Indians, not Native Americans, in case you should wonder). There is ONE person of color on the 'good' side, but I forget whether he already got killed off (and if not, I am sure it's coming up in the next movie). In a movie featuring all kinds of unreal creatures -the makers couldn't stretch their 'fantasy' enough to refrain from portraying whites as superior and people of color as inferior? And what's worse -how many people noticed this? Watch this movie to educate yourself on all the stereotypes that have been accepted as normal in Western society -but for nothing else."
4,"The dvd itself in great condition, but...",the movie was a yawn fest -have to put it back in another day to finish.couldn't believe how it dragged in the beginning. Disappointed.
2,PIRATES IN NEED OF AN EDITOR,"I swear these movies go nowhere, I mean on some level they are swashbuckling fun, but it gets old quick and this opus is almost three hours. The screenplay is all over the place, I mean do you expect to find a voodoo priestess in the south pacific, it's like the writer was just like..why not? I like everyone else, liked Depps Keith Richards impersonation in the first movie, but it's a one note trick, it's like ok we get it, you're doing Richards. Frankly, im no fan of Bloom, he just does not responate, he gets lost when he is on screen with Depp or Knightly but I did like many of Sparrows crew, they were very funny at times. The special effects were excellent, no doubt much money was spent on this film and you can help but be awed by it, but this is without question the weakest of the three movies; it's overlong and short on story, that sound contraditory I know, but there it is..enjoy."
2,Disappointing. Especially after the entertaining Curse of,the Black Pearl. Too long & boring. It drags in a lot of spots. If you're a big Johnny Depp fan you'll enjoy Capt. Jack Sparrow mincing around but that's about it. The rest of the cast walks through their parts. Hope the third installment picks up.
2,They should have stopped after the first film.,"They should have stopped after the first film. Curse of the Black Pearl was an outstanding film with interesting characters. Dead Man's Chest introduces new characters who feel like extras instead of actual characters. This film clearly does not stand up to Curse of the Black Pearl. The best part of this film is when Barbossa walks down the stairs at the end. The rest of the movie was slightly interesting, but mainly boring. They tried to do too much from a simple concept and it ended up being a cookie-cutter Hollywood film, lacking story and good characters, and mainly being just special effects. Worth watching once though, but not a classic."
2,the best pirate movie since the last one,"i wasnt overly impressed by the first one, i liked this one even less, and i bet that by the time i get suckered into seeing the next one, ill like IT least of all."
3,Not as good as the first one,"I was disappointed- possibly because the first movie was a surprise hit and this sequel had so much hype leading up to it. The soap-opera drama wasn't necessary at the end of the film, but I liked it. THe computer graphics and imagery was better on this one though, believe it or not!"
1,Cliff hanger!! No real ending.. unresolved,I sat through about 2 hours and felt very empty afterward since the movie just suddenly ends and leave the situation unresolved... now have to wait for #3. Of course I still would watch #3 when it comes out but have to wait that long.... booooooooooooooo
3,Not as good as the first.,"This movie was fairly good, however it seemed to be way too long and was not as exciting or intriguing as the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
3,Not as Good as the First One,"I was very dissappointed in the Plot of this movie. I guess you really watch these movies for the action and special effects?But this was a very poorly thought out plot, watching the movie it was easy to get lost, and ask yourself ""why are they doing that?""It had a few laughs, otherwise just the special effects are ok. I think that they just wanted to make a sequel, so they just hurridly put a movie together.The good thing about this movie, is that my Sister gave it to me for Christmas! :o)"
3,So-So,"This movie was not as good as the first one. I was so disappointed when I came out of the theater asking my dad millions of questions that weren't ever answered in the movie. It was really hard to follow and I didn't understand the majority of it. They also had too much action and animation then the main thing - plot. I mean after I've watched it a few times, I began to get the movie, but still. Cool animation - bad storyline."
3,Overdone With Overkill,"The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was fun but I think its huge success went to the filmmakers' heads because the excesses of the sequels definitely take a toll on the franchise.More, more, more...of everything, except the fun. Long, convoluted action scenes, a jumbled mythology weighing everything down. Heavy helpings of CGI and stock plots. Excess ruined THE MATRIX trilogy and it also nearly sunk the Pirates.There was a decent balance of the thin characters in the first movie but more of these people are definitely less. Does anyone really care about Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's lovers? In the sequels, they both appear to be doing nothing but posing and defiantly jutting their jaws at the never-ending battles.Yes, there's action and special effects and fighting and swordplay and cannons...but eventually it's just noise."
3,"Good quality, not so great flick","Pirates 1 was really a great film but Disney made a boo-boo with framing issues on the blu-ray but at least after months and months, they are willing to fix it. Anyways, this second film in terms of video and audio quality is quite good. I can't fully test the audio since I don't have any receiver or high quality speakers so it wouldn't matter to me, but the image is crisp. Too bad story-wise, I felt it was very poorly scripted. I watched it at the theater once, fell asleep. I rented the DVD, watched it and again couldn't finish it before I fell asleep. I purchased the blu-ray version of Dead Man's chest just to have a complete set when At world's end comes out but it doesn't mean I like this 2nd movie. If you have never seen the first one and do not intend to see the last one, you will be very lost with this movie as it leaves a big cliff-hanger at the end."
4,Just good old fashioned family entertainment,"though i think disney's non-Pixar animated work has been lackluster for a while, it has produced some great non-animated films, such as the Pirates' franchise (not to mention such movies as High School Musical, the Rookie, Invincible).arguably Pirates 1 is better than the sequel but they're both fun, funny, entertaining and appropriately moody. johnny depp is the underappreciated genius of his generation -- his pirate-cum-keith-richards persona is brilliant."
5,RipRoaring Fun!,"This is easily one of the best movies not only of the summer but of the year. With an exciting story, effects and completely lovable endearing characters, Pirates is a must see!! Johnny Depp has suceeded in making another endearing and immortal character in Jack Sparrow."
1,So dissapointing,"This movie was such a let down, the plot was almost non-existent, and the pace of this movie was awful. I enjoy Johnny Depp but he can't carry a movie with no plot and make it work."
3,Decent follow-up,"Dead Man's Chest is a decent follow-up to Curse of the Black Pearl. You'll love seeing the characters again, and the story is interesting, but it's not nearly as good a movie as the first one.Worth watching once so that you get to see all 3 of them!"
3,kraken is whack,starting to get kinda busy . a significant step down from the first (character driven) comedy . thus begins the cavalcade of needless characters and deminishing return . bring on the computers . genuine filmaking exit up ahead . CG WHY ? all-a-bored . it's Johnny and his super friends . or is it enemies ? your interest beginning to wane ? were 2 and 3 even necessary ? break out the defibrillator for this dead fans chest .
1,Disappointing,"Once again here is a movie where the special effects overshadow the story. This has all the elements to be wonderfully entertaining--good consistancy with the previous movie, the same wonderful characters and an interesting story line. However, there are too many different story threads, many completely unnecessary. Some of the characters are given short shift and some were likable in the last show and now are made to be hateful. The comic scenes are great, but too few and far between, and, of course, there isn't enough Jack Sparrow. This is much darker than the last one and not near as much fun, which is what made POTC1 a movie to be watched over and over again. The ending was not only a complete let down, but an unnecessary cliff hanger. So sad, because this could have been so good, but was just a huge disappointment."
2,...wow...,"I bought this toy for my sister and when i opened the box, a battered up Elizabeth Swann Figure in a dinged up box fell out. I wasn't happy since the paint job on the toy was coming off onto the plastic covering. When my sister opened it I had a closer look. The face didn't resemble Elizabeth at all! Even my sister noticed. To make things worse, the swords and torch didn't fit Elizabeth's hands very well. Lastly, the blade of the golden-hilted sword broke off and all that my sister has to fight off sea monsters is a golden hilt and a silver sword. I have higher hopes for the Jack Sparrow that is coming in the mail..."
3,"A little off the deep end, but fun still.","I just saw this film and as sequels go it is not bad. We get more Captain Jack Sparrow and that is always fun. The plot is a little muddled though and the story drags just a little bit in the first half and towards the middle. The last half though is very fun especially the three way fight over the ""Dead Man's Chest"" toward the end. It is a little disappointing that the movie ends with essentially a cliff hanger, so be forwarned you may feel a bit used when the credits roll because closure is 12 months away. Still the movie has its good parts and the main cast of Knightley, Bloom and Depp are fantastic. If you liked the first movie I would definately recommend this."
2,"Johnny was great, but the movie wasn't...","When a movie's good, I don't mind it being long (like ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"") because it holds your interest the entire time, but this movie didn't do that. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Don't get me wrong--Johnny Depp is always at his best. He's the only good thing about the sequel. But even though he was in it throughout, it felt like his parts were watered down. His dialogues felt too few and far in between. Also, Davy Jones' crew was a disgusting bunch to watch. And I didn't like the connection they tried building between Jack & Elizabeth, which only hurts the relationship they built between Will and her. Anyway, what's worse is it looks like the 3rd installment will be more of the same."
2,disappointing!,"After falling in love with the first movie, I couldn't wait for the sequel. Dead Man's Chest was the most disappointing movie I have seen in a while. The story line was too complicated to follow, there were way too many sub-plots, and the whole movie was extremely boring. On top of these things, it was gory and some of the half man half sea creatures were disturbing. See this movie in the theaters if you must, but chances are you will come out disappointed."
1,freak show,"Lots of freaky people and terrible monsters. The end. The story makes no sense, is not consistent with itself or the first movie, and tries the hardest of all to insure that you will see the next episode. The audio is so poor that you can't understand what the people(freaks) are saying. 30 minutes of slime, blood, and tenacles is all that I could stand."
1,Cliche Hollywood Tripe of almost the lowest order,"The acting was fine, the costumes were very good, as were many of the special effects, esp. the Cthuloid Long John Silver. The reason for the one star is that it seems the film makers were afraid to do anything unexpected (the great fight on the mill wheel was the only original thing besides the undead pirate make-up) I never once felt surprised or not know what would happen next.One of the biggest budget films in history based on solid marketing products, that came out before the movie. Sell out! What a stinker. Hollywood greed at its worst. They created the audience for the movie. At least the first movie, over rated as it was, had the innocence of no pre-marketing connections. And that one did have a few surprises.Booooo, I felt cheated out of the time I spent watching it."
3,Definitely Disney!,"I liked the first movie better, I thought it was more natural in the acting, dialogue and fight choreography. This second episode is way too Disney, aimed at younger viewers and very artificial overall!"
1,We rented THIS?,"What a waste of time & money! I Cannot believe this is getting the good reviews it is. The first one was awesome and the second one was just a cheap, manipulative way to make money. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Skip this one and you'll thank me."
5,Dead Mans Chest,"This is the sequel to the Hit movie Pirates Of The Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, which was an awesome move and so is this one. In this movie it has more intense scense and out of this world sea monsters who belong to Davey Jones. this movie rocks."
5,Excellent,Loved to watch Johnny Depp in just about anything but would have to say this is his best. Can't wait for the 3rd instalment.
5,"Great, but not as great as the first...","I'll admit it, I'm a fairly new Pirates fan. I never really cared to see it till I saw previews for the 2nd. So I saw the first, and I just fell in love with it. I enjoyed the 2nd just as much, but it simply didn't match up to the 1st.It delivers the expected: sexy Orlando, goofy Jack, and some awesome action scenes. But what sorta messed it up was the ending. I know Jack will be back in the 3rd, but still, he's the most beloved character. And it doesn't make sense to kill a character olnly to bring them back. I still enjoyed, and I'm still absolutely obssesed with it. Can't wait till the 3rd!!!"
2,disappointed,"It was listed very good .thecover had a tear in it and the movie would stop ,and skip at times,I had to restart it"
2,Way too smooth,"The first movie already contained a lot of bollocks, but this practically identical sequel just goes beyond a certain limit. Again we find brave Will, spice girl Elisabeth and Captain Jack Sparrow up against a seemingly invincible opponent, Captain Davy Jones who has, yes here the bollocks really kicks off seriously, a face made of octopus. Jones and his also half man half fish crew have controls over a huge sea monster and live under water. Sofar the real scary plot...everything is just way too smooth. There are no real bad guys and all violence comes with a smile. In that case I rather watch the old A-team series again instead of this. Part three will be out next year and no doubt it will break new records again. It is impossible for true film fans to love this movie. (SARR)"
3,A bit disappointing,"I loved the first ""Pirates."" It was well written, crisp and funny. This one is still funny, but it is neither well written nor crisp.The entire subplot of the cannibal island does nothing to further the plot, and, while entertaining, could add to the enjoyment of the movie by being removed.Finally, not even the Harry Potter series, in which one expects a sequel, leaves one so hanging at the end. This is more like a 1930's serial, than a movie in the ending.Still, Johnny Depp is delightful, Kiera Knightley is lovely, and Orlando Bloom is charming."
5,"""John Q Republican"" is a moron.","Doing my part to balance out the insane ramblings.Beautifully acted, exciting and fast paced, Pirates is a treat. A rare adventure story, with engaging characters and startling special effects. A feast for the senses, with lovely visuals, and wonderful music. A little gory, so be careful if you're faint of heart . . .Otherwise . . .Yo ho, yo ho, a Pirate's life for me!"
1,Absolutely Awful,"Not only would I like my money back, I would like my 150 minutes back! That time would have been better spent talking on the phone with my mother-in-law, and THAT is boring!Davy Jones animated face is the only good thing in this movie. The plot is a thin as Paris Hiltons boney butt. The acting is as wooden as a daytime soap. The ""action"" sequences are waaaaaaaaay too drawn out, and as others have said, this is just a prologue for the next movie, which, by-the-way, I WILL NOT be watching.Disney movies are getting worse and worse as time goes by, and this is THE worst by far. Can I give less than one star?Anyone want to buy a DVD cheap, used only once? Would make a nice coaster."
2,What a bore!,"I was so impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl, that I anxiously awaited the second film. I must say that I was most disappointed by it. I have tried to watch it twice and each time I kept dozing off. I found it way too long and very boring all the way through. While the first movie was hysterically funny, it seemed as though this one was trying to be, but fell short nearly every time. One cannot fault the actors. Johnny Depp is one of the best male actors of our time, in my opinion, and his performance was superb in this movie, as it was in the first. But the story seemed to drag along, and the ending, when it finally arrived, was no ending at all, merely hanging there obviously letting us know that there is another one coming, folks. Perhaps the next movie will make up for this one, who knows; but I hesitate to watch it when I couldn't even stay awake for this one."
5,sequals,this sequal is 99% as good as the original. sadly this does not alway apply to sequals. good viewing for all ages in my opinion. looking forward to seeing what disney has planned for part three
2,Pirates of the Caribbean,The music is too loud. You have trouble understanding the actors because of the music. The plot is hard to follow because of the loss of dialogue. It is probably a good movie if you could follow the story. Bought 2 DVD's to make sure the one was not defective. Both are the same.
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this movie but I liked the first one better. This one seemed a little to kiddy with Davy Jones. However, if your a fan of Captain Jack Sparrow its still worth your time."
4,Not as fun as the first,"Good pirate movie but not quite the dash of the ""curse"" also with a little sense missing."
5,Ahoy Davy Jones! A Seaworthy Sequel,"It's rare that a sequel surpasses the 1st movie, but in the case of ""Dead Man's Chest"",it's worth seeing again and again. Johnny Depp and his merry 'ol crew of rogues get themselves into another misadventure when a calamari looking Davy Jones come looking for Capt. Sparrow over a long ago deal that Jack now has to play. Orlando Bloom and Keira knightley have their own problems when their wedding is interrupted by an ambitous Lord and decides to arrest them for helping Jack escape. However, if they were to bring Jack back, they would receive a pardon. Of course Orlando's Mr. Turner accepts the deal and meets up w/ Jack on a island where he's about to be sacrificed and later on Jack returns the favor when he sends Orlando to Davy Jones.If you love swordplay, comedy action and romance then this movie brings it all. And of course you'll love the climax of the movie (Poor Jack) and the surprise ending where it'll lead to the final ""PoC"" film. This DVD is worth getting!"
5,Pirates,"Loved the film in the movie theater, love it at home! The second disk is really nice, packed full of interviews and behind the scenes stuff. I am an amateur costumer, so I enjoyed the chance to see more of them up close. Love Orlando, too, and looking forward to wearing out the movie disk."
3,Nice Picture,"Pelicula con un buen ritmo, tal vez en el límite de acciones de confrontación, pero bajo una buena actuación del conjunto de actores. Pelicula típica de recreo para jovenes y adultos, pero por loq ue he dicho al principio, tal vez fuerte para niños pequeños. Es una película que vale la pena sumar a la colección individual de casa."
4,Pirates 2 dazzles almost as well as the first,Everyone knows that the first movie in a series will almost always be the best. its a new and fresh idea. but if you enjoyed pirates 1 then i know you will enjoy 2 just as much. it has a darker feel to the movie but the humor is still there. it is 2 1/2 hours but you dont feel it. and when the movie ends it left me yelling for more.
5,pirates purchase,My children wanted the Pirates of the Carribean DVD for Christmas. The movie was excellent. We enjoyed it more on DVD than seeing it at the theater because we could stop and review and play subtitles when it was hard to understand what one of the characters had said. No one will be disappointed with this movie.
3,Shiver me timbers! Jack's back!,"While I am the first to admit that I was clamoring for a longer Pirates of the Carribean after the first movie sped along at breakneck pace and seemed to end much too soon, I now wish that dead Man's Chest was shorter. Depp is way more than competent and as supremely entertaining as he was in the first film, but the story drags on and on through many unnecessary scenes and is ridden with more plot holes than Jack Sparrow's wardrobe after a swordfight. There is more tedium which retracts the swashbuckling fun of the first film and the danger is less apparent in spite of a computer generated black pearl wrecking octopus the size of the national debt. The film has plenty to laugh about though, and entertainment is what a film like this is really about, so the fun value is still high, but Dead Man's Chest needs quite a bit more conniving on the part of the writers to bring out the abundant treasure we saw in Black Pearl. 3.25 stars"
4,Good but not as good as The Black Pearl,Blu-ray makes this a must-have. Effects are great even though the second in the series isn't as good as the first.
3,Kinda disappointed,"This wasn't as good as the first movie, unfortunately.It wasn't bad, the special effects and Davey Jones plot was really cool, and all the acting was fun and entertaining, but for some reason just didn't have the luster of the first movie.Good to watch if you want to see more Johnny Depp, though."
2,abuela1,My three year old grandson is obssessed with pirates and Elizabeth Swann. However when he got the action figure he said it was not Elizabeth. I agree that it is not the closest doll to look like Elizabeth but there are some worse out there. He still played with it. If you must have one I think this is the one that I find looks more like her. It is durable. Recommend it as long as you are aware it resembles Elizabeth but does not look that good.
4,An Awesome Film!!!,"This is a really good sequel that takes place a few months after the original. Will and Elizabeth are offered clemency by Lord Cutler Beckett if Will can get Jack's compass which points to what its possessor wants most. Along the way, Will runs to the Flying Dutchman, and meets Davy Jones who is also after Jack. Eventually, Davy sends out the Kraken, the large beast who belongs to Davy that stalks the waters. I highly recommend PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST!!!"
1,wrong country setting,"It could possibly be a mistake on my part, but the dvd that was sent was not for use in the United States and I do not remember reading that in the description when this was purchased. I had to go and buy another copy at a local store."
3,Pirates of Caribbean Dead Mans Chest,"I know, why buy it? Seems when cable has run out of ideas they run this movie for months and months at a time. What actually makes this movie enjoyable is seeing it with out commercials. And it is great to see how and where they made the movie.Now what is damnably wrong about this whole trilogy is the insistent reiteration of the theme song(s). The constant pounding of the music, is just a annoying as laugh tracks on every mediocre comedy produced for television. Disney, I know you want people to spend money on every aspect of every movie you make or produce, but enough musical dreck is enough!!! Not every movie needs a melodic line running through it. If I desired that much constant music I would go to a concert. By the way, concerts and symphonies give their listeners an intermission, maybe you could try to show some restraint as well."
5,An absolute delight!,"The ""critcs"" could not have watched POTC2 with any attention (if they watched it at all) or else they would not have panned it.POTC:DMC is just plain fun with a good dose of mysterious plot lines to keep everyone guessing. Great links with the first POTC and many ""loose ends"" to be tied up in POTC3. Can't wait!!"
5,Pirates,"One of the best movies in the series. Could watch it over and over again. Acting, effects, are top notch throughout the movie."
5,Pirates of Zcaribbean: Dead. Man' Chest,We loved the movie. My grandchildren it as much as we did. The older boys can wait to watch it again!
1,Amazon sucks,"It was not clear that I was getting a Download, I thought I had clicked to BUY a DVD of the movie to watch on our TV at home with the family. I don't watch anything on my PC. I'll buy all future movies at a store, where I know what I am getting. There was no way to stop the purchase once I realized it was a download."
1,Dissappointing,This movie was awful. The story was slow paced. It was just scene after scene of impossible action sequences. Save yourself three long hours and just don't watch it.
1,Pirates of the Caribbean,"This was one dark and dull, dull, dull movie. Even talented Johnny Depp couldn't save it."
3,Not as good as the 1st one,The story was a little slow getting started and a bit confusing. It picks up about 45 min. to an hour into the movie and the ending could have been better.
2,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest,This movie was not as good as the first and I thought that it dragged on too much.
5,johnny depp,johnny depp should get 5+ stars for his acting in both pirate movies hes the best actor of our time
4,"""Pirates"" Invades DVD This December","Disney has announced single and double-disc editions of ""Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest"" which stars Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. Each will carry a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, along with English Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks. The single-disc version will include two writer commentaries and a blooper reel. The two-disc collector's edition will include that along with a number of behind the scenes featurettes that detail the characters, stunts, special effects, and Pirates lore. You can also expect trailers, and a preview of the next Pirates film."
3,Still a good pick...,"The movie is loaded with action and fantastic special effects, but it does tend to ramble on and often loses its direction. A little more editing would have pulled this together to bring it up to the first movie's level. I'm still going to buy this DVD, and I look forward to the third installment with excitement."
3,Please ignore the man with the pencil,"This movie was about as good as one could reasonably expect, given the fantastic ILM-supplied special effects and good performances turned in by Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport, and Keira Knightley, and given that the script was apparently written by trained monkeys."
1,"I don't know who was more bord, me or Depp","Somehow i just don't find this movie all that entertaining. Johnny Depp looks bord in many of the scenes of this film. Special effects are not anything i really enjoy or get excited about but give me the older days when pirates were pirates. He sort of look like a badly made up drag queen. To me the good films of today are very few and far inbetween. This one is way far inbetween. Don't bother. Rent yourself an old Gene Kelly MGM Pirate movie instead. Actors today,,,,yuk!"
1,Very Weak Pirates 2,"I agree with the minority opinion, that his movie was a grave disappointment. It was very weak and not entertaining. As the one reviewer points out, there ARE many similarities to the Indiana Jones series. Like that series, the first (Raiders of the Lost Ark) was fantastic, as was the first Pirates. The second (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) was very lame, as was Dead Man's Chest. No interest in seeing either of those again. So, now the question is whether Pirates 3 will be a big comeback as was the 3rd Indiana Jones (Indiana Jones and the Last crusade), which was terrific. I hope so, but am skeptical. Since Pirates 2 and 3 were filmed together, it leaves little time to reflect on what a poor job they did with Pirates 2, in order to make up for it in Pirates 3. We can only hope."
2,Give this Pirate a wide berth,"The first ""Pirate"" movie was an amusing diversion but the second one is just an overblown bore.This being a sequel the characters are no longer fresh - Depp's Jack Sparrow character has definitely outworn his welcome.Give this ""Pirate"" a wide berth."
2,Not quite the same Sparrow!,"Although the scenery was breathtaking, the movie experience wasn't quite as rewarding as the first adventure."
5,You will have a debt to pay if you don't see this movie.,This is the greatest movie ever made. The action was perfect. The acting was great.
1,Huge Disappointment,"Shockingly disappointed with this movie! The Black Pearl was great with the quirky Jack Sparrow, the entertaining escapes, the fantastic story line, the whit, the various predicaments-I could go on and on and on...Dead Man's Chest was TORTURE to watch! The quirkiness was gone, the Sealife pirates were ridiculous, the obligatory escapes were a complete bore and drawn out way too long, I couldn't understand most of what they were saying with the ultra thick accents every character seemed to have, and the twist at the end with Jack and Elizabeth left more than a sour taste.There is no chance I will waste my time with the third movie they will obviously be making since they didn't even bother making Dead Man's Chest a completed movie. They must have known this movie wouldn't be able to stand on it's own so they had to make it a 'To Be Continued'Very disappointing!"
1,FIRMWARE UPDATE,"Well the second disc was reconised but the first one got stuck at 0:00,All the other blu-ray movies I have did have no probs except this one............Sorry one starI got the sony blu-ray player BWU-100A"
3,Nothing on the disc set...,"I was extremely disappointed in the lack of a discussion on the value of the ""Two-Disc Special Edition"". I was trying to decide between this or the Wide-screen as I am concerned with loosing some of the special effects by not getting the Wide-screen... none of these reviews speak to the value of this package."
4,pretty good,not as good as the first one probably should be a renter not buyer but hey no complaints.
3,Pirates of the imagination........,"Well, I settled down to watch this thinking it would follow on a bit like the 1st film....... I may need to watch it again I think as the first time round rather ambushed me. Someone is smoking some serious stuff as we rather departed even further into the land of fevered imagination I thought, but then I maybe described as a Bluff Old Traditionalist. Good fun nevertheless but if theres a 3rd movie we had better strap oursleves in for a ride to the land of 'it helps to be as high a kite', tiddly pom and chuff chuff..parp parp pencils up the nose time..."
1,Dead Man's Chest is cursed by the black pearl me thinks,"I liked the first one but this movie was el-sucko. Too much CGI, goofy costumes, outrageous scenes and obviously toooooooooo much rum too. The movie was so filled with blurred-speech I could hardly follow the plot.Thanks Disney for wasting my time and money."
3,Entertainment - that's about it,"This movie was disappointing.About an half hour could be cut out and nobody would miss a thing.The special affects and sword fights were good.Other than that it was a letdown.Despite Depp's hilarious role,the film was doomed to failure due to its poor script,storyline,character developement,and some less than perfect acting.The movie ended with a million loose ends-too many.Still,it was entertaining and Depp kept up the interest and whoever played Davy Jones was great."
2,Disappointing,"It seems that 95% of the reviews are glowing, but I hated Dead Man's Chest. I've seen the first movie six or seven times, and it still hasn't lost its humor and glorious silliness. DMC does deserve an extra star (up from one) for its decidedly entertaining action scenes. Black Pearl was so much more than action, though...In the sequel, Jack Sparrow is an entirely two-dimensional character and his fellow protagonists are flat and entirely uninteresting. Will and Elizabeth are thoroughly unconvincing when declaring their mutual love.The relation between the East India Company and the Crown as represented by the governor of Port Royal is utterly unbelievable and seems more like a reflection on the current involvement of big business in politics than anything that could actually have occurred back then.I'm sincerely hoping that Dead Man's Chest will turn out to be what 'Back to the Future II' was to BttF I & III -- a really awful movie wedged in between two great ones."
5,fun for whole family,"The movie is funny and well done but there is also a second disc full of activities like how Captain Jack's costume is put together and what the individual pieces are. There are some ""behind the scenes"" bits and a great feature on the computer animation. Those clever little Hollywood elves!I can't wait for #3. Let's hope Keith Richards ""gets"" it."
4,JOHNNY DEPP MAKES THIS MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE IS GOOD BUT CONFUSING. YOU WILL HAVE TO WATCH IT A COUPLE OF TIMES TO GET IT. IT IS A LITTLE TOO LONG TOO. THE FIRST MOVIE IN THIS SERIES IS MUCH BETTER. THIS SECOND MOVIE IS GOOD, BUT DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE FIRST. HOPEFULLY THE THIRD WILL WRAP IT ALL UP."
3,"okay, i guess","this movie is really just supposed to lead into the next one. This movie and the next one should have been combined into one movie, except that then it would be really long (not that that's a bad thing). It's a decent movie. It just doesn't really have a resolution."
5,pirates for the 21st century!,men will always have a pirate in our hearts! it's just part of growing up reading adventure books. hail pirates forever! (erg!...)
5,Dead Man's Chest is a sure winner!,"Fast-paced adventure on the high seas, a cast of comic, swashbuckling pirates, and good ol' Captain Jack Sparrow- how much better could it get?! The sequel picks up where the first movie left off. This time, the action centers on a new set of villains: the corrupt Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company, determined to control the seas and wipe the last of the pirates from the planet, and the mutant Davy Jones, captain of the Flying Dutchman, who's tentacles threaten to strangle the life out of Jack for his failure to repay a debt owed to Jones. The inspiring soundtrack revives some of the favorite melodies from the first movie while introducing new themes for Davy Jones, Obeyah priestess Tia Dalma, and Jones' pet sea-monster, the Kraken. The film ends with a surprising cliff-hanger that will keep the viewer itching for more!"
4,Dead Man's Chest,Another very good movie in the series. This is the second movie. I liked the first onePirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl [Blu-ray]a little better but thats my personal preference. The effects are awesome as usual and the hi-def video and audio quality were great too. If you liked the Curse of the Black Pearl I think you'll like this one too!
5,Great adventurous movie!,"I adored this movie. I have heard from people that they found it confusing, but I disagree. I got everything perfectly the first time around and loved it from beginning to end. The acting was great, Johnny of course was awesome as usual and the effects were amazing. I loved the length of the movie too. Most people would think it long but it had me completely enthralled that I forgot about the length. Its just a great fun popcorn flick. Actually, its the epitome of popcorn flicks."
3,"If you like pirates, you'll like this movie!",A swash-buckling saga of pirates in the high sea - with superb acting by Johnny Depp. Imaginative and fun - brings you back to your childhood days!
5,Great Sequel,This movie is great................I won't spoil the ending but you'll be looking forward to the next installment in the series.
5,What can I say,"What can I say about Johnny Depp and this movie. This was a very funny movie. I was intrigued throughout the entire movie, there was not 1 moment that was boring. I highly recommend this movie for laughs."
3,pirates of the Caribbean DeaaMan's Chest,"Lotta hipe,and money spent on this movie,but it just when on for too long.I dosed off in the middle."
3,Not as good as the other 2,"Orlando bloom is pretty good. Johnny depp acts way to gay in this movie. That part is sooooo not right. Since he's supposed to be like this killer guy like in 1 and 2. Not many good fight scenes and the girl in the film ""kiera knightly"" or however you say it is useless!!!!!"
4,Great... Disappointed in Ending...,Our whole family loved the Pirate movies... We were just a little disappointed in the ending.
5,"Very pleased with the product and service, as usual.",The movie is a delight to watch by the whole family and the Amazon service is as exceptional as I am accustomed to.
4,Fun Romp of a Movie,"It's active, campy, swashbucking adventure through and through. Depp is in his element, and seems to be having a jolly (roger) good time."
3,Pirates: Dead Man's Chest,"Overlong without resolution. Has a few inventive, funny sequences in a savage island but ultimately unsatisfying and a set up for another sequel."
5,"Rate the movie, not your firmware","This movie is stunning, If you need a firmware update, do it, it's easy and free. Then rate the movie. The 2 pirate movies are outstanding. Disney did an excellent job and I can't wait for pirates 3!"
5,Great Movie! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom Rule The Screen!,Great Movie! I love that the characters stay true. The graphics are unbelievable! All the characters work well together. The action is intense. The movie makes you just want to say ARRRRR!!!! and buy a parrot.
2,Ridiculous marketing ploy,"Terrible movie! This is nothing more than an expensive and drawn-out segway to the third movie. The only thing keeping me from giving this 1 star are the very good special effects. But all in all, this movie lacks the wanderlust, good fun of the first movie. This one was too lengthy and uninteresting. Unless you plan on watching the last one, don't watch this one."
2,poor movie,After the first one expectations were raised for the Dead Man's Chest. However it was rather dissapointing and the only bright spot of the movie was Johny Depp- and the stars go to him. The visual effects were not bad but the plot was poor.
1,Don't waste your time,We saw this movie in the theatre because we heard it was funny. We waited through the whole show but it never got funny. Just dumb. Rates as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
5,I love this movie!!,"Great fun,but I would not recommend for children under age of 8, because it can be scary.Johnny Depp is great as usual."
2,Where's the charm of the first?,"I'm in the very small minority here, but I didn't care for this movie at all. It seemed to lack all the charm and spontaneity of the original, as though the producers racheted up the special effects and production just to cash in on the Pirate's ""franchise."" Even Depp's performance was sub-par (and he's one of my favorite actors!); he didn't seem to have his heart in it. The others called their lines in by phone!I mean, what in the world were those early scenes on the island with the hungry natives supposed to be about? It didn't do anything to add to the story or the characterizations. It was absurd -- but not funny.To me, the entire intention of this movie was to sell products and promotional items -- not to entertain.Okay, go ahead and hit the ""not helpful"" button -- but I just had to put in my dissenting opinion."
4,Exciting,"I loved the original, an was very excited to see the second. I have never really been impressed with the sequels, always seem to fall short. I found this movie entertaining, and interesting. At times some secenes seemed to long. I waen't impresses with the classical music in one sene.It had a darker plot, and other tidbits to chew on.This was good in my impression for a sequel, and served it's purpose to hipe up the viewers for the final act. I expect that the next will be an emotionalm roller coaster.Some have under reviewed this movie. I will buy this one."
5,Great swashbuckler!!,"Lots of people seem to think that this movie was a disappointment compared to its prequel. I think the complete opposite. The 2nd movie was better, in my opinion. It was the only ever movie I watched twice in theaters. Also, sequels have a tough challenege: living up to their previous movie(s). Pirates 2 certainly met this challenge head-on and won.Of course, every movie has downsides. For this movie, they were running time, patchy plot, etc. It was a whole 2 and 1/2 hours, but, to counter this, it seemed a lot shorter. The patchy plot was, of course, confusing, but I didn't mind since everyone ended up in the same place, anyway, and you under stood the basics. What I really didn't like was the new love triangle between Will, Elizabeth, and Jack. The love triangle eliminated all efforts made by characters in the first film. I am a full Will/Elizabeth supporter.I love these films. They are my absolute favorites, and I cannot wait until the third one comes out May 25, 2006!!!"
3,Not as good as Black Pearl,Dead Man's Chest has better special effects than the Black Pearl but overall Black Pearl was the better of the two and the best of the three - I have not yet seen Stranger Tides.
2,everything sucks in this film,This is a dicusting picture not even [the scary presence of Davy Jones] scares me The first one I really like its wellploted smart funny and had a great swordfight.The second one I dislike Its hard to follow goofy retarted and very childish.Don't wast your money on this.
2,Very disapointed,"I know I am in the minority here, but I loved the first one and was very excited to see this one. I don't know if my expectations were too high after the first one, but I found this to be really bad. My wife wife actually liked the first one and fell asleep during this one. I just found it really disjointed and felt they substituted special effects for story. Its a good movie for little kids I guess, but I don't see this to be anywhere near as good as the Spider man movies, The Incredibles or even the Mummy Returns for that matter. If you haven't seen it already, I would recommend watching it first or waiting for the price to drop before shelling out $20. It's worth watching but I didn't need/want to own this."
2,Terrible,"Let me start off by saying how much I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Johnny Depp was brilliant, the story was fun, it was immensely entertaining, even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does.I think Disney let their idea people get out of control. The movie just got too crowded with special effects and totally goofy plot twists, which eventually robbed a good cast of any opportunity to actually act. Davey Jones and his crew are so over-endowed with gimmicks squirming over their bodies that they ended up more being more distracting than entertaining. And why did the director need to get so focused on being as gross as possible? Johnny Depp nibbling on a necklace made of human toes was something I didn't get; I didn't need it, and neither did the movie.Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a let down. I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except maybe that it is making a few people a lot of money."
3,"To be fair, I bought this movie by accident","But since I bought it, I watched it. The first time that I watched it, there were a lot of distractions and so I thought that I had missed some crucial bits because the movie didn't seem to have much of a point. So I watched it again a week later in a quieter setting and I have to say that I still don't see much of a point. I won't say that it wasn't entertaining. There are plenty of far worse movies out there where I feel like 120 minutes of my life has been stolen from me. I won't watch it again but I'll probably watch the third one since one of the scenes involving Depp was filmed in my town."
2,Sequelitis or Laziness?,"Quite a letdown from the first. The characters became less sympathetic. Depp's character acts like a classic sociopath: say and do anything to further your own goals, regardless of how it harms others. Knightley's character is not far behind. Bloom's character remains rather noble, but his nobility blinds him to how others use him, making him appear stupid. The sound track was harder to hear than most other DVDs on our system, so I missed about half of the dialogue. No problem: the plot was predictable. The characters on the whole were flat and stereotypical (dull). The producers seemed to know this, trying to cover it with a plethora of special effects. The third installation may prove some of this analysis wrong, but the protaganists are going to need to really make an effort to become sympathetic and/or well-intentioned. Otherwise, it's just Seinfeld meets Long John Silver."
3,Entertaining but more than a bit disappointing,"Elizabeth and Will's wedding day is interrupted by an arrest warrant, and Will goes off on a desperate hunt for Captain Jack. This sequel starts off with a bang and gives back all our favorite characters, but goes downhill from there. There are too many subplots and too many loose ends that are never tied up. The movie gives us plenty of dazzling swordfights - but they're dragged out for too long, and improbability is only entertaining for awhile before it becomes simply absurd. The viewer begins to wonder if the movie will ever end, and then is disappointed with a cliffhanger that leaves nothing settled.I was also turned off by the violence. Davy Jones and his monster crew crossed over from simply grotesque to stomach-turning, and the violence (floggings, prisoners being murdered) crossed the line for a swashbuckling adventure flick.Let's hope the next movie gets it right. Only three stars."
2,Horrible saga,"Totally disapointing piece of trash. Pointless, boring, grotesque, confusing, and violent. Filled with the disgusting humor and the ridiculous romantic scenes, which characterize the latest American movies. This is another example of a typical B.S. movie, along with ""The War of the Worlds"", ""The Day after Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"", etc. The only reason why I didn't rate it with cero stars, is because of the excellent special effects and the great scenery. It's a shame that Disney Productions lent itself to producing this horrible movie. Pirates of the Caribbean number one, was a great movie, this one's not!"
2,This pirate should have died the first episode,"My friend and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest yesterday. This was the worst picture we have seen in years. We saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean and were looking forward to the wit and charm of the new film. Instead we were bored to death with a stupid plot, horrible creatures and a very boring experience. I would not advise anyone to see this at the theater. Wait for the DVD, rent it if you must, but not worth buying. Hated it!!!!"
1,Bad dvd,"The movie of course was great, but the quality of the dvd was very poor, we get to almost the end of the movie and it started breaking up into all those tiny pixels, quite annoying!! I should have returned it, but what a hassle."
5,Overblown but great fun anyway,"What more could I want..? MORE JOHNNY DEPP!!! The movie sizzles like a lit fuse on a firecracker when he's on screen. More Popeye-type muttering under his breath would have been welcome. But, God, what more could you ask for in a summer movie? It's beautifully shot, the evil guys (the British) are very bloodless and Dubya-like, Davey Jones and his crew are pretty weird, but it works, and the good guys (the good guys and the very delectable Ms. Knightly) are pretty good most of the time. The voodoo priestess actually blows away Ms. Knightly's trembling sexuality and the cliffhanger at the very end of the movie will positively have you stomping your feet and yelling for more.This movie is FUN. What more could you ask for..? I cannot wait for the third installment!!!"
4,PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN - Dead Man's Chest -TOO Widescreen,"We loved this movie...better than the first, although the first was a gem as well. Viewed in a movie theatre it was quite an experience, however, this series (referring to the first) when released on DVD is only in the EXTREEM WIDE SCREEN EDITION, I'm assuming this new edition is the same. Even on a large 16 x 9 format monitor there are still black bars on top and bottom of the picture...on a 27 inch standard or smaller TV the picture with all it's action is JUST TOO SMALL. There should be a choice of FULL SCREEN with all the extras on DVD as well as the wide screen edition. You also lose one-half of the picture resolution when the picture is reduced to a narrow band in the middle of the screen. At one time many DVD movies had BOTH CHOICES ON ONE DISC. A great movie with just a technical complaint. FOUR STARS due to the extreem widescreen formatonly."
2,pathetic movie,"a movie that is advertised with the disney label shows whipping, throatcutting and guys having their eyes eaten by crows? if walt disney was still alive he would fire every one of the movie bosses for this! because even though its PG13 alot of parents will show this to their small children who will have nightmares for a week!never mind a bogus plot, a missing ending (only to make you go see part 3) and an overbearing, incessent music track and i really wonder how this could become such a hit? all johnny depp manages to portray is a permanently druken pirate...were it not for some good visual effects i would have given the movie only 1 star."
1,Dead man's blu-ray,Sad sad day. The kids are crying and there is no yo-ho-ing. My bluray will not play this movie!
2,This is a Monster Bone-Crunching Gorilla with no Spine.,"Though this movie had charm, had swashbuckling, had Orlando Bloom, and special effects, it had no sensible structure.If you're looking for a good two hours and change of monsters, swords, Indians, ocean, and laughs this is your movie.If you need some structure, this is a ramble from one swashbuckling event to another with no coherency or climax. Worse this movie builds toward something then just falls off the last fifteen minutes to ensure the viewer will buy a ticket for the next showing."
2,Disappointing,"I immensely enjoyed the first 'Pirates'. It was engaging and entertaining. This second installment seems to lean entirely on the success of the first. The dialogue is trite and unimaginative. Several of the scenes left me wondering what they were there for. They added nothing to the plot or depth of the characters. Some of the redeeming qualities of the characters in the first movie were left behind as they tried to invent additional scenes to 'entertain'. Elizabeth especially was more heroic and intelligient in the first movie. She became silly and ridiculous in this one, checking her moral foundation at the door. The best scene was the last, where Captain Barbosa makes an appearance, giving us hope at least that the third installment may recover from this disappointing film."
2,Good if you're a forensic pathologist,"The humor in this film is really funny. There is a poignant scene near the end that is truly touching, and all the actors deliver fine performances. But unless you are very hardened to the thoroughly gross, the movie is visually revolting. I very much enjoyed the humorous scenes, but would never watch it again and would never recommend it for a child."
2,Another bad sequel done for the money,"Loved the first movie, we watch it on DVD frequently, hated this one. Everything that we liked; story, dialogue, pacing, etc. is missing.It's a two-parter, and I wasn't expecting that. A over 2 and a half hour commercial for the third part in 2997, and I wasn't expecting that either."
4,"Well, It's Not As Good As The First One, But It Is Still Very Good.","I think the title says it all. The first movie was certainly the best, but the second one isn't too bad either. I rate it 4 out of 5 which is pretty darn good. I liked it. I saw it in the theater 3 or 4 times with different friends.Other reviewers have told you what it is about, so this is just a personal opinion, two cents post.Certainly worth a buy, but maybe not a frequent watching."
4,Very long...,There was a lot of story to cover in this one. I had to watch it 2 times to really take it all in. Very well done in the effects area. A little cheesy at times but still very entertaining.
3,Cant wait to see the next one.,"Kinda long, was hard for me to follow the story line compared to the first one. Johnny Depp not as funny as he was in the first one, not because of him but because the writers didn't give him the chance. I missed the sense of comraderie and Depps quirky, dry sense of humor. There were missed opportunities to make us laugh. But all in all an ok movie."
4,Entertaining,"This sequel has given Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and William Turner even more action sequences to perform. Compared with the Curse of the Black Pearl, the plot may not be that alluring. Yet the movie should be credited for daring to be different from the first. Instead of monsters under moonlight and treasure hunt, here we have sea battles in daylight, leviathan and cannibals on a beautiful island. Moreover, Keira Knightley has a bigger role here - more adventurous, sophisticated and she looks charming. So does Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) in his own way. It is interesting to see some mutual attraction between Elizabeth and Captain Sparrow. To be frank, Johnny Depp is still the one to watch. Without this Captain Sparrow, the movie will be just another big budget summer movie."
5,Captain Jack Sparrow's Return,Captain Jack Sparrow returns in good form. This is a very spirited follow-up to the original. Orlando Bloom shows greater depth but so does Depp. This film is well filmed and produced and entertaining. Hans Zimmer's score is rousing and very welcome. Great texture all around ehance the impressive stunts.
3,Air cushion,The cushion is a very high quality item and although it has not had much use It appears that it will hold up well.
3,Had trouble,I purchased a foam memorey cushion in the past and wanted to try this one as i felt the reviews were great.No one told me I had to have a degree in phisio-therepy to have it good to useI haven't used it yet as I've asked some friends for help and am waiting for their visit
2,not MY kitchen,"Advice is ok, but the photographed kitchens easily cost $200,000 or more. Not everyone has 25 foot vaulted ceilings with views or $15k Viking stoves.If your planning on designing a masterpiece and live in Malibu or Manhatten, then this is your book. If your like me, and will end up at Lowes, you may find ""Kitchens That Work"" by Edic more interesting."
2,Geared to contemporary kitchen lovers,"I do not often write reviews on books but I was just so disappointed with this one. First off I found the kitchens in this book uninspired and many of them just impractical. For example there are more then a couple kitchens in this book with either no upper cabinets or just 2 or 3. What is that about? I will say that if and only if you are really into super contemporary kitchens, I mean some of them looked like they were out of some futuristic movie, you may be able to justify the pricetag to yourself, otherwise pass this one up."
5,Another great book by Mr. Welch,"Great book to complement his previous artwork ""Winning"". Every business person should read this great book."
2,A case of arrogance commited to paper,"This is the first book I have read by this famous business person. I read quickly, so it took about 30 minutes. It is a simplistic book presented in a way that one might write to one's employees. Each chapter is a a statement followed by a hint of justification. Pretty arrogant actually. I gave it to one of our High School interns who found it somewhat educational because he knows nothing about the B world yet.If JW was not famous, then this book, in the form of a paper, could get a solid B at a Business school. Here is my version of one of his chapters: ""I, the ex boss at a company that makes a lot of money on a whole lot of products which are never the best-in-class, say this, and because I am famous you can buy my book so I can continue to cash in on my great PR. The end.""What to read instead? WSJ."
5,A recommended pick for fans of Lovecraft,"Yellow Sign And Other Stories is a recommended pick for fans of Lovecraft, providing a collection of weird tales in the Lovecraft tradition of subtle horror and lurking underlying monsters. At the heart of it all is a 'Yellow Sign' and a horrible book which brings terror to those who dare to open it and mysterious beings who support an ancient horror. The stories are linked in tone but stand alone as excellent tales."
2,Caveat emptor!,"The subtitle of this book, ""The Complete Weird Tales of Robert W. Chambers,"" is highly misleading. The only complete works in this volume are ""In Search of the Unknown"" and ""Police!!!"" The rest of the text contains simply excerpts from five other books by Chambers. If you are looking for all of Chambers's writings, not just some representative pieces, you will need to look elsewhere. Amazon sells a 4-volume set, ""The Collected Supernatural and Weird Fiction of Robert W. Chambers,"" which contains about 2,000 pages and is certainly far more complete than this collection of fragments."
2,Few pearls in too many pages,"Editor S.T. Joshi warns all the readers that Chambers can reach sometimes the nadir of literature and that he tried to not include the worst thing in this collection.Nevertheless the disappointment is high as soon as you end the book and realize that only the first 88 pages are worth reading (that is the King in Yellow)on a total of 643.In the remaining 555 pages ideas are scarce, character are monodimensional and there's a disturbing sense of racism.I'll advise Cthulhu and Weird tales fan to get a book with only the Repairman of Reputation (which is indeed a marvelous story) unless they are truly collectors."
2,truly weird,"very inventive. very original. and ha sure knows how to keep the reader from knowing what's going on. but he is too anarchicc in style, suddenly taking a long path AWAY from the horror. for example, he suddenly creates a love story in the middle of building a horror story with great promise. he can make a story become an unclear blur. he doesn't obey any rules, and it does not suit the stories."
5,Quinten again faces nimrod.,"This is a great finish to the series that Lawhead developed. You can start with this book, but I would recommend reading the previous two first. Quinten again is matched against the evil Nimrod. He loses his son, his sword, and his wife has left him, to seek advice from the God most High, in his most needful hour. The book weaves in Christianity in a mysterious way and still has a great story line! What more can you ask??"
4,"A ""must have""","I love Stphen Lawhead and was thrilled to read these books. This was the first series he wrote and it is not quiet as good as his other works, but you can still the the genious creativity that is his trademark. The Sword and the Flame is mostly Quinten's struggle with how to balance being a king and being a man. You see an emotional side to him that isn't sappy or wierd, but completely human. As a reader we can relate not only to Quinten, but to his friends as they either stand by him or desert Quinten in his time of need. I totally recomend this book, it is one you will read over and over again."
1,Beef is Better,"My issue with this dvd is that it has some odd moments in the interviews where certain events seem mixed up and confused. I wish that the stories that each person trys to describe were pieced together better. By the way, this documentary is all interviews and no clips or archive footgae from any of the feuds. The beef dvds are by far better constructed and more planned out than war on wax ( I beleive thats why this dvd didn't make a continuation, because there were a lot of feuds that went uncovered). But I have to admit that the DMC interview and DJ Red Alert interview were by far the best of the entire dvd.I wish there existed a documentary purely on the east vs west coast feuds."
5,lovely Christmas tale,"Such a whimsical story about a little christmas tree ornament, her new ornament friends, their scary experience of being attacked by Bad Cat,& the magic of Santa."
4,Overall 4 star rating,"It does what it claims - definitely an infant to toddler rocker - I rock my 3 month old in it, and my 2 year old nephew likes it too.The only thing I do not like (so far) is the toys are too close to where the baby sits - will get cross eyes, so usually I do not insert the toys."
5,The Lifesaver Chair!,"I've never taken the time to review a purchase that I've made, so hopefully that helps to say how strongly I feel about absolutely loving this chair! My son has loved this chair basically from day one. He's five weeks old and therefore isn't really into the toy bar right now, but I'm sure he will be later. But he does love to take naps in it (he happens to be taking a nap in it right now). The vibration is perfect. I've only had to change the batteries once so far, but we use this chair and always with the vibration on because if he falls alseep in it and you turn the vibration off he'll notice and wake up and not always fall back asleep. I picked out this chair because I wanted to be able to get my money's worth out of it instead of a normal bouncer that they can only stay in until they're about 25 pounds, but I definetely feel like I've already gotten my money's worth out of it anyway! Awesome chair! Would recommend it to any parent!"
2,Not what I expected.,"This thing is not as good as it looks, when it rocks it moves across the floor and I am not happy with this product at all."
1,"Horrible chair, very unsafe","had three of these chairs between my twins. Hated every one, very unstable. I was alway afraid it would break with my child in it. very poorly made, after using for a while chair started to wobble. Tighten all the screws and everything, didn't help one bit."
1,"UNSAFE, rocker flips all the way forward","I was at a friend's house and used the rocker and I had my child in it for not more than 3 mintues (thankfully she was strapped in) and she had it flipped forward. I can't tell you what it feels like to pick your baby off of the concrete she is lying on her face not knowing what you will find. She hurt her mouth and was bleeding a lot.I am mortified that there is a product on them market that can flip so easily. Didn't they test this thing? Furthermore, after finding this page to write a review I find out I am not the only one. Please don't risk it!"
4,Delivery awful,"When I received this product, the package was destroyed and the product bent. I tried calling Target, and there was nothing they would do for me. I have an infant and am now using a possibly dangerous product. One of the runners was bent during shipment. Because we didn't realize this until we put it together, Target wouldn't let us return it since the package was opened and couldn't be put back in its original state. The rocker is great, but I paid for a brand new one and received a damaged item instead. I'm very angry that this happened and will think twice about buying anything from this company again."
4,pretty good,"we bought this chair to replace our bouncy seat, because my son hit the 25 pound weight limit at four months and we decided to find him something else to sit in, and this worked just fine. i love that the weight limit is 40 pounds! the toy bar could be nicer, neither of my kids ever cared much for the toys, but they both enjoyed the chair itself. good investment for very large babies, like mine!"
4,Pretty good for a while...,"This chair is nice to get if you have a larger baby (like my son) who quickly outgrows smaller playseats. He didn't like to sit in it for too long, because there's a hard, board seat without too much padding. He did like the toys pretty well, but sometimes got frustrated when he couldn't pull them towards himself more (mainly to chew on). The toys are detachable and can be used seperately when the child gets older.The ""kickstand"" feature is nice for securing the seat to put baby in it, or to stabalize for young infants. Never used the ""calming vibrations"" feature. Fairly easy to assemble (and disassemble, when it needs to go into storage)."
4,Good bouncer,Good buy for the price and it can convert to a rocking chair! We have this at grandma's for our son and he likes it!
3,Just a so-so,"Isn't all that soothing, entertaining or comfortable for the baby. Since purchasing this product, I have been noticing the bouncers at friends' houses and see that most others are superior to this one."
5,awesome!,"it was new and delivered on time! i would deffinately buy from this seller again! the rocker is perfect and my borhter and his wife loved it. they use it very often and she is always quiet, so she must be comfortable!(:"
4,Fantastic Buy for a Bouncer Seat,"My sister gave me this seat for my second child and we love it! The colors are bright, the toys are interactive and I love that it is a bouncer and can convert to a rocker for a dual-use purpose. This is a fantastic value for what you get. My son loves the toys and my 18 month old daughter can even sit in it when he is not using it to rock in (obviously when the bar is moved). I will definitely be giving this as a gift to other parents-to-be."
2,"Cheap infant seat, wouldn't trust for my toddler.","My mother purchased this chair for my son and when it came, I was disappointed on the quality of the parts. It's cheap metal and plastic. My son has issues with gas and reflux so he is in the chair a lot when sleeping as I am afraid to lay him down, the chair is ok as he is only 5 weeks old. My daughter wants to sit in it and when she gets in, it sways. She is 23 months and only 24lbs, it shouldn't be that flimsy! The screws are as tight as they can be, but the plastic is just cheap. I will be buying another chair as soon as we can. I just do not trust this chair to hold my children.We had purchased a Jeep brand travel bouncer for my daughter from a tag sale and it is sturdy! 2 years later it is still intact and usable."
2,Not as expected,"I bought this for my daughter who is 1 month old. The moment I put her on it, I knew, she would not be comfortable.I think, this rocker is designed for kids 1 year and above but certainly not for infants."
1,UNSAFE,My 5 month old recently discovered her feet. While sitting on the Fisher Price infant rocker she leaned forward and fell right off the chair bumping her head on the floor. She was tightly and securely strapped in so this should NOT have happened especially for a product designed for infants.
4,Just vibrate by itself and cannot rock the baby automatically,"yep, if it is on the product specs i did not read it. So... please be advise that it does not rock the baby automatically.I think the vibration does not calm down my baby, otherwise it make it cry. I use it with Summer Infant Snuzzler to make it more comfortable to my 1 month old baby and she sleeps well on it with this configuration.The product is well done and has good quality. As my baby get older it is certain that she will like the toys on it."
5,Grandioso!!!! Amazing!!!,"Una muy buena compra!!!El producto es fantastico, muy util, gran calidad.La caja entra en una valija, y si se quiere, se puede desarmar todo.Un gran precio."
4,Great Chair,"This chair is great. My son loves it! I'm glad that it is something that he can use and not grow out of for a long time! The only thing That I would change is the toys. They are attached with velcro. When my son pulls on the musical cow he ends up pulling it off, not playing the music."
4,Nice Chair For The Money,"We bought this chair for my daughter before she was born, hoping it would do everything we wanted. It was wonderful when we first brought her home, she'd fall asleep in it a lot. When she got bigger she loved to bat at the toys and have them swing all over. Once she was big enough to roll we put it away, but we plan to use it as a little chair when she's a toddler. It was reasonably priced and did what we wanted it to do."
3,Baby Mia loves it!!!,My daughter loves the seat!!! But the batteries for the music were dead when product was shipped!!! Had to run out to get batteries because Mia loves music!!!
4,"Nice, but a little loud?!","I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet! Nonetheless, a few things I noted. First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured. They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it. That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow. Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides! The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head! The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at! Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat. I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review. On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!"
2,toddler rocker,I have bought 2 of these infant to toddler rockers and each of them have broke as my child was rocking in it. I would not buy this particular model again.
5,Baby pink :D,"me encanta es muy lindo y cómodo para el bebe los colores son brillantes y estaba a muy buen precio, es el producto que mas rapido e recibido estoy muy contenta con la compra que hice así como con el vendedor de esta silla"
3,Just OK....,It looks nice but the toy bar not so good..... vibration feature is not soothing.....Overall this rocker is just OK
2,BABY TIPS OVER AT 4-5 MONTHS - UNSAFE,"I yhought this chair was great when my daughter was a newborn but the minute she tried to start sitting up the chair doesn't work for her.When it was in the rocking position, I found her leaning as far forward as she could go, almost falling out if I hadn't had her belted in. So I started putting her in the stand position so she couldn't ""rock"" it forward and somehow she leaned so far to the side that the entire chair tipped over with her in it and landing right on her head!I would not recommend this chair for infants who are trying to sit up. I will put this chair away for when she's older and as for now I'm stuck buying another chair that won't do this. Very disappointing."
2,Not good for children over 1,I thought this chair would be great for my 15 month old but it is not. You cant remove the harness so it is uncomfortable for him to sit in it with the harness still being on the chair. It is not very sturdy and I think this should not be advertised as a toddler chair as well as infant chair. Not worth the money and if I still had box I would send it back.
5,Great item,I had one of these chairs with my first son and i was so happy to find this one. My new son loves it just as much.
5,Perfect alternative to a bouncy seat,"I bought this rocker chair because my 6 month old son was wearing out his bouncy seat. He nearly reached the floor weighing in at 17 lbs. this chair also allows me to feed him without having that rocking motion. overall, great buy after bouncy chairs hit the floor!!!!"
4,wonderful thing to have around the house,"I have this rocker's last year's version. It was a wonderful thing to have until my son was 7-8 months old. We started using it when he was 1 months old and could hold his head up. He would be in it either sitting or reclining back. Once he got old enough and could sit up, he would just use it in the kick back position, otherwise he would lean forward and could tip over. But for 7 months we got good use out of it - a safe place to leave an infant when you are doing chores around the house."
4,Exactly what I was looking for!,I wanted something I could use now and later... I love this chair and Amazon had the best price!
3,"It doesn't bounce, I know, it isn't a bouncy seat... but so you know, it doesn't bounce.","We received one of these as a gift. It was our 3rd child, but 6 years after the 2nd child, so we had given away much of our ""stuff""; including the bouncy seat. We thought this was going to replace the bouncy seat, it doesn't. It is a rocker and a leg swings out to hold the seat in place if you don't want to rock. Our baby didn't care much for the rocking. That's it, just wanted to make sure folks realized this isn't a bouncy seat. It isn't."
4,Like this,Very convenient for my kids to sit in. I wish I would've ordered another one. My kids love this. LOVE
4,Baby loves it!,This is a good size rocker. I bought it for a 4-month-old baby and it's perfect. Assembling it was quick. Instructions were fool proof. Baby especially loves the musical thingie in the middle. Only problem is that it only plays music for about 1-2 minutes then you have to pull on it again for the music to play and there is a Velcro on the back to fasten the fabric together that doesn't hold up well.
2,Very disappointed,I had the blue cow chair when my son was younger. This time I got the pink for my little girl (who is just 4 months old). This rocker is very flimsy compared to the blue one. I've tried tighten the screws and still it shakes. I will be returning this!
1,TIPS OVER!,"My 8 month old daughter loved this seat because if offered her the chance to sit upright and she enjoyed being able to remove the toys herself (velcro), but as she learned to rock it, she tipped the entire thing over on her face, bringing the chair down on top of her (she was strapped in) and the toy bar down over her head. She was not hurt (small red bump) but was very frightened (as were my husband and myself). Luckily we were both right there with her and were able to extract her from the chair very quickly. It did take two of us to get her up, one to move the chair and one to pick up the baby (who was still attached). I do not reccomend this chair! There are safer versions available."
1,Very Dangerous Product,"I was so excited about buying this product, me son loves to rock, until I brought it home. My son is 9mths old and the first day he tipped it over backwards!!!!I was not at all impressed, very disappointed with Fisher Price.I called to voice my concern to FP and quickly returned it to the store I bought it from."
3,This chair could have been better,"I was somewhat disappointed with this rocker. Since the upper portion of the chair has no padding, I used foam pipe covering so my son wouldn't hurt his head on the rim. Also, two of the toys on the bar are virtually identical and the musical cow faces away from my child. I would have gladly paid more for a sturdier, more comfortable chair."
2,Disappointed buyer - mom of 3,"This product is not as versitle as I had hoped. My first two children used a bouncy-seat when they were babies and loved it. When they moved the seat jiggled a little. This chair has to be on a hard, smooth surface to move at all with baby, otherwise he's just sitting there wondering why he can't quite reach the toys hanging in front of him. As a toddler rocker, it's too reclined even in the upmost position."
2,Why is the cow backwards?,"I bought this for my son at birth. He used it a lot while he was 1-3 months. The reclining position is great. When he started sitting up he did the same thing, he rolled it with him in it. I was in the room also. but he ended up with a pretty big bump on his head and was grouchy the rest of the day. A question I have is, why is the cow backwards?? When put on the cow is facing the wrong way. When you turn it around it doesn't stick to the velcro and is easily pulled off. Not a very sturdy item, there are better ones out there."
3,"Not Bad, But Not great!","I gotthis for a gift and it was great in the beginning. My son liked being in it in the bathroom when I showered. But he's older now and if he leans forward to grab the toys(with him being buckled in)the whole rocker tips forward with him. He doesn't like the vibrator at all. He also can take the toys off the velcro straps and throw them overboard...kind of defeats the purpose of velcroing them if you still have to continuously pick them up and revelco them. Good in the beginning and hopefully he'll like it as a chair when he's a toddler, but the in between stage seems to be better suited to any other bouncer or exersaucer than this. There are better things to buy!"
4,Loved this one!,"Our baby did well with this as a tiny newborn. She wanted to be held constanty and the vibrations could sometimes ""fool"" her into thinking that we were holding her. She spent many a night sleeping in it in the early days and weeks.Now at six months, she LOVES the toy bar and goes crazy for it. Some parents remarked that the babies tipped over - now that my girl is trying to lean forward, I use the bar again and just put the seat recline in the upright position. She can't tip with the bar in use. We love this seat! In the mornings if she wakes up before I'm ready to be up, I put it next to the bed and she plays and then falls asleep and takes a nap!"
2,I wish I hadn't bought this,"I really thought that this would be great for my son to hang out in as an infant while strapped in, but as another reviewer points out, the 3 point harness is no good for a child beginning to sit up or lunge forward. Also, the seat is really hard and the whole operation is not as nice as other FP items. A disappointment---my son is now 2.5 and we keep the rocker sitting in the living room filled with toys."
2,Great idea... poor execution,"Although it was ridiculously easy to assemble, this chair wasn't an instant hit with my daughter. It only has one speed on it (rough and choppy), and apparently it doesn't work for her. It leans back so far that she can't reach the attached toys and that frustrates her. Hopefully she can use it when it converts to a toddler chair?"
5,Love it!,What a beautiful girly chair. I have a blue one for my boy before. It is a simple chair which is exactly what I want. Simple and safe to use. Recommend it.
3,"Great infant seat, but not a great toddler seat",We bought this for our four month old as an additional seat. She loved pulling the toys and listening to the music. She liked the vibrations. Once she reached nine months she just wanted to climb out of it. We couldn't use the rocker because she would just rock until it fell forward. The seat leans back very far when the front handle is down. She did not like sitting so far back unless she was asleep and she was too old to sleep in chairs.
4,awesome buy and great gift idea,I purchased this for a friends baby shower because I really enjoyed mine. This is a wonderful product and I would recommend everyone with new born baby or one year one to buy one. This makes it so convenient you can use last a long time. I love mine and I am glad I purchased one because I did not need to buy another when my second or third boy was born.
5,LOVE IT !!!!!!,We have a bouncy seat and this rocker also. My 4 month old son loves the rocker better than the bouncy. There seems to be more room in the rocker than in the bouncy seats that are out there. He is not too happy about the attachment that has the toys on it but that is ok. I would recommend this to everyone who is having or has had a baby. It is wonderful !!!!!!
5,Great product!,"This is the second rocker like this that I purchased. When my oldest son was born we were given one. He was a large baby and fit really well in this chair- it replaced our bouncer. As he got bigger he still enjoyed using it. We recently had twins and got so much use out of the first rocker that we decided we needed a second one. My oldest, who is now 2, would still like to continue to use this if it didn't now belong to his brothers. It has great longevity- one of the few baby products that I was able to use for years rather than months or weeks."
5,ONLY BABY ITEM I'VE EVER RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE!,My son has used this chair since infancy and is still using it now that he is 2.5 years old and 35 lbs. He absolutely loves this chair. When he was an infant he slept in it for two months (with the kickstand up of course)until he transitioned into his crib. We toted this chair all the way to Michigan for him to sleep in when he was an infant because of a lack of crib. I never had a problem with it tipping and I still have yet to see my son tip it over even now that he is 35 lbs (and I still use the kickstand sometimes). Now that my son is 2.5 years old he watches his videos in it and I even strap him in sometimes when I need to leave the room. This chair was well worth the money and is the only baby gift I really used and liked. It truly lives up to its name as an infant to toddler chair (rather than those bouncy things that only last a couple of months).
3,For hard floor surfaces only,Just be aware that this kind of rockers don't rock well on carpets.Also the back recline is a little too steep for small babies
3,"Great chair, but tips easily.","First, let me say that this is a great chair. My 8 month old twin girls really enjoy playing with the toys, and they seem pretty comfortable. However, I have to very keep a close eye on them at all times in the chairs when it is in the rocking position. When they sit up in the chair and lean forward, the chair has a tendency to tip over forward. I usually put a blanket under the front of the chair to keep it from tipping. My only other complaint is that the seating harness isn't wide enough. It constantly slips to the side leaving my daughters leaning to one side or the other."
4,Sweet little rocker,"Very nicely built, sturdy. Looks like it will last. The reason for four stars is the music is really short on pull toy and our baby loves music! Price was incredible. Buy it!"
5,love it,"i love this rocker. My baby loves it too. After she was 2 months old, she doesn't regular bouncer anymore. However she likes to sit in this one until now (7 months). We feed her milk and solid food while she sits to free our arms. Great stuff!"
5,loved this chair,Love this rocking chair. My 1&2 year old enjoy using it while watching TV it rocks them to sleep at times keeps them entertained
4,Great infant seat!,I bought this chair for my 2 month old son to use at his grandparents house. It was great! It kept him entertained longer than the bouncy seat we have at home and he would even nap in it when took the activity bar off and put it in the reclined rocker position. He isn't old enough to rock forward and tumble out of it like others have said but I will watch him as he uses it as he grows.
1,NOT SAFE,"This chair can tip over if your child reaches forward, overbalancing the chair. My son tipped the chair and fell face first into the hardwood floor. Luckily, he was not seriously injured. The instructions for the chair say NOTHING about being usafe for infants who can sit up, but that is what a representative at Fisher Price had to say about it! ""NOT SAFE FOR INFANTS WHO CAN SIT UP."" Shouldn't that be on the instructions? Infant to Toddler Rocker is a misleading name, if that's the case. The response by Fisher Price was to offer a refund. This product should be RECALLED! This could have led to a serious injury. I see numerous reviews about this product being unsafe. Where is the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission? I called them numerous times but could not get my call returned. BEWARE!"
2,Infant to Toddler is the perfect name!,"I have the previous version of this rocker. My son absolutely loved it as a baby. Now he is 2 years old, and it is still his favorite place to sit in our living room. He does not use the toys anymore, and we never pull the kickstand out or use the straps, but he still falls asleep in it from time to time. I have hand washed and hang-dried the cover numerous times, and it still looks great with the same vibrant colors it came out of the box with. I really feel that I have gotten my money's worth and then some. Terrific product!"
1,Buyer Beware,Poor customer service. Product doesnt last very long motor breaks with in months if you use it. Fisher Price customer service gives you a run around and does not back there product. Every time you call them you get a different answer. I am staying away from Fisher Price products.
1,Don't buy!!,I purchased this rocker thinking that it would be more light weight and sturdy. I learned that this was very flimsy the vibration sounded like a motor boat and the toys are only velcroed so when you pull the handle on the cow for the music the toy comes off. The kick stand was nice but I purchased the newborn-to-toddler rocker to see if it was better worried that it would be more bulky and heavy. It is worth the extra 7.00 and my son LOVES it. It doesn't wobble the vibration is very quite the toy bar is great because the toys are very secure it has a kick stand and its collapsable for storage. Don't buy the infant-to-toddler rocker.
3,"nice, but hard for baby to reach toys","Our daughter loves the colors and the dangling, spinning toys, but she gets SO frustrated that she can't reach them to play with them!She's four months old--definitely old enough to be reaching for and manipulating objects--and she's very tall for her age, but she still is miles away from being able to spin the toys on her own. Why would the makers of this swing put toys that are perfect for someone my daughter's age too far away for even the tallest of kids (that age) to reach? The package says that you can remove the toys and attach them to the seat strap, within reach...but she doesn't even see them down there. It's a shame, because she's so fascinated with them.Other than that, the chair is fine, and I'm sure she'll enjoy it even more when she's big enough to rock in it."
2,Head over Feet,I have a 8 month old son and he likes it for about 5 mins at a time and today as we were sitting there with him he tried ti clinb out and the whole thing with him in it fell over backwards and he slid out of the strap how he did it we dont know But beware when you buy thid it only work untill youre kids are 3 months and then you have to put it away untill they can get into it and out of it with out getting hurt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is why I rated it a 2 because it scared me half to death and him to
1,Disgusting with how Fisher Price treated my complaint!,"My son wound up upside-down with his head inches away from the ground while buckled in. I wrote a letter to Fisher Price, telling them about this. I received a letter in the mail a few days ago to call their 1-800 phone number. I am disgusted with Fisher Price! I'm not ordering anything from them again and I would suggest you do the same since children can be hurt by this product and all they can tell you is to call their 1-800 phone number. RIDICULOUS!"
2,nice but not very practicable,This rocker is nice. My baby likes the toys hanging from the bow. But actually its a little hard to really rock this rocker. A less fancy one does the job much better.
5,Can't live without it,"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker in Blue/Red is not the nicest thing to look at...in fact it looks quite cheap. But this baby can stand up to anything! My wild toddlers use it in all manner of ways (as a boat, upside down, on its side, as a rocking chair, etc.) and each of my babies has used it to sit near us all at the table.The great thing about it is that it drags across the floor like a sleigh so you don't have to carry it everywhere with the baby in it. Just grab the toy bar or the back bar and drag it to where you want it. Slides on carpet or hard floors.When you're done with it, easily disassemble it and it stores FLAT wherever you can put it. Cover is easy to wash and install/uninstall.I've used this for 2 children in the past 2 years and it has been a huge blessing. They hated the swings and bouncy seats and loved this!"
4,infant rocker,It has helped to get our grand child asleep several different times. This is a big chore since she doesn't go to sleep that easily.
3,Not more Option to play,I am a Grandmother who ordered this chair for my first grandchild. It is a really sturdy seat. The only addition I would request is that it has an option to play soothing tunes along with the vibration.
3,"Good with older siblings, Bad toy attachment",Positive Attribute: Good with older siblings who can sit in it and rock without damaging the rocker. Other bouncy seats are rather flimsy and cannot survive an older sibling's play.Negative Attribute: Toys attach with velcro. This eliminates the possibility of using other toys with the rocker and using the rocker's toys with other baby equipment (ie. with arches or car seat).Overall -Worth the money and is nice having for the baby.
3,Just Okay,I bought this product because of the high reviews it got. Putting this item together was a pain in the neck. I needed the assistance of my sister-in-law because it was so tricky. My daughter will only sit in this for a short period of time before she gets bored. The toys on it bore her. I wish that the bar had rings for the linkadoos so I could change them. I would definately go with another seat if I had the choice again.
4,nice size rocker,"We like using this rocker for our baby. He is on the tall size, and he quickly outgrew his other rocker (Fisher Price Rainforest Rocker). He likes this one a lot and it is nice that it converts to a toddler ricker when he gets a little older"
4,Great Idea,We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. She loved this seat and so do we. It allowed her to be in the same room as all of us and be able to be at our level (on the floor) while we played games with her brother. Our 3 year old son also loves it. He of course uses it as a rocking chair. Its a very versatile gift :)
5,Every child should have one,"We received this as a gift at our baby shower. My son, who is now almost 3, has used it since the day he was born and continues to love it. The fact that it is adjustable is wonderful too. He was a big baby, and had outgrown the baby bouncers by the time he was just a couple of months, this he still enjoys using.I also run a daycare and every child loves that rocker. Ours is old and warn and we'll probably have to get another with our next child, but it has held up through three years of daily use by multiple children, you really can't expect much more than that. I have found that there is a stretch of time from the time a baby starts crawling until they start walking that the chair really isn't the best. At this age they have the coordination to wiggle themselves to the point they fall out. Most babies seem to be able to get out on their own safely by the time they start walking though. We almost put it away when we hit that stage and I'm so glad we didn't!Charlene"
4,"Good, Sturdy Rocker","I bought this rocker because my daughter didn't like the swing that we had. She's only two months old, but she likes this chair. This is the only place I can set her while she naps. Since it vibrates, I can set her in it, and she doesn't wake up right away like she does when I set her in her bed. I leave her in it with the kickstand up while she's napping, but she also likes being rocked in it.My two year-old also likes the chair. It seems pretty sturdy because he weighs 30 lbs, and he climbs all over it without hurting it. One downside is that it didn't come with any sort of infant headrest. We took the cushion out of an old carseat to keep her little head from flopping while she's in the chair."
5,Excellent for your baby,"It's a very nice build chair, sharp color, solid structure. And most important, my baby love to stay in it!!!Pro:1.Good quality2.Comfortable3.Useful (Play,Feed,Sleep and etc.)Cons:1. The vibration function seems useless. Can't calm my baby."
3,Not the right fit,"My mother-in-law purchased these chairs to attempt making caring for twins a bit easier. While the girls would occasionally sit strapped in to play with the dangling toys or watch the TV, they often fought and wiggled to get out. When I attempted to use the kickstand to help with feeding I found that they were laying too flat. Without the kickstand I had to keep a foot on the rocker to hold it in place. Some children may love these, but my girls had no interest in just hanging out in them. I am not even sure that they will use them once old enough to rock as they seem like they would topple easily and a child sits fairly high off of the ground in this."
1,Unsafe for sitting infants,"Just wanted to add another cautionary post here about your baby tipping over. My 7 mo. old was within a second of face planting as she reached for a dropped toy--I luckily looked over and caught the chair right before she smashed into the hardwood floor. It's kind of disappointing since I think of Fisher Price as a gold standard in child product safety, we grew up with Fisher Price products ourselves. Some other people have written here not to use the chair in rocking mode with infants of this age, but this isn't really made obvious, and I naively thought that since the product says 'safe up to 40-lb. toddlers', it was engineered to not tip over. It's not a bad product overall, but this is something that anyone who uses this chair should be aware of."
4,My son loves this!,"My son loves this chair, I enjoy that it has a tilting back so he can be in different positions. I like that the arch has a musical element but I do not like the other elephant toys and my son has no interest in them and he can't reach the musical one in the center. I have two other fisher price chairs and I think the toys on those are better. I got this as a replacement for the Fisher Price Deluxe infant to toddler rocker (left my deluxe one at grandma's house for visits), but I think at some point I will switch them out to get the deluxe one back, it sits deeper and higher on the sides. I also find that because this chair has a board at the bottom for the seat it makes considerably more noise than the deluxe which is just taught fabric. I would recommend the deluxe over this one, but it is still a good chair."
4,Well worth the money,"I wish I had bought this sooner! When my 7 month old son started tipping his bouncer seat over, I replaced it with this, and I realized that he could've had it all along. He loves it, and I have seen him lean all the way forward and the rubber stoppers keep it from tipping over. I also like that it has the vibrating feature, which he realy liked in his bouncer. It is a great value since I know it will grow with him. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 becasue the toy bar is not quite in the right place. My son likes to lean past it and ends up bumping his head on the toys instead of playing with them. It's not a big deal,though, because he usually sits in it when he is watching a DVD, or reading(eating)a book."
2,Not what I expected.,"This wasn't what I thought it would be. I bought it because it would go from infant to toddler years, thinking I would get the most use out of this seat. However, it wasn't very functionable for our son as a new born. It was almost too big when it was in a stationary position and it was a pain to move from room to room. For our next new born I am buying a different one that is more comforting and soothing. The vibrations on this seat are too much for a little baby and it doesn't play music. The only really good thing I have to say is that now our son is 15 months he loves using this chair as a rocking chair. So it does make a great toddler seat, but not a great infant seat."
1,Good until your child is 8 or 9 months - then totally scary,"At 8 or 9 months old, my son was strapped into this chair and threw his body forward with enough force to face plant onto a hard wooden floor with the chair on top of him. I was able to watch it on the monitor that has replay and it was totally scarry. Avoid."
3,Nice chair for our baby,"Home from the hospital, our baby hated this rocker. So I didn't use it often. I would force him to sit in it while I showered so he could sit somewhere safe and I could keep an eye on him. I had to talk to him nonstop and pick him up immediately after getting out. I would put him in it when I made the bed... or while getting dressed. (The rocker is in our bedroom). He only lasts for a few minutes in there though. I can't read him a story in the chair.. or leave him in it and start doing something that doesn't involve playing with him at all.He likes the ""If you're happy and you know it clap your hands"" melody that plays.. but it plays only once. He hates the way the chair vibrates. I turn it on, he cries and wants out.Had I not received it for my shower, I probably would have been fine without it. But since I have it, I use it. It's okay for what I use it for."
3,Not what I hoped,The toys that hang down from the toy bar almost hit my son in the nose. It's so kind of hard getting him in and out with them hanging down. He doesn't seem that entertained by the chair or the toys on the toy bar anyway.
4,Great Gift!!,I bought (2) F-P infant to toddler rockers as gifts! Great for newborns. Babies can sleep and play in the rocker.
5,The BEST seat!!!!,My twins outgrew their bouncy seats at 3 months. We still needed them. When I found this one at Christmas I was so happy. It grows with your child up to 40 pounds! My five year old could even sit in these. We used them for feeding and sitting the twins in until they could sit on their own. The seat comes off to be washed as well. Well worth every cent we spent on them!!!
4,Great in General,"I have had this since my son was born. In general he loves it.I was able to use the reclining option for the first 3 months (until he had head control). He liked his swing more during this stage but it was nice for while I was in the Kitchen or other areas of the house.From 3-6 months he LOVED this. Now that he is 6 months and starting to sit-up, he can pull himself forward. I walked back in the room to see him hanging forward. The good news... henever fell over. Most people experience their children falling over in a bouncer around this age and I was happy to see he was still upright (at least the chair). He seems to think its funny to hang forward so I have stopped putting him in the chair until he is a little order and can enjoy it as a chair.I think this was one of the better purchases considering cost and use!"
2,Low quality construction,"Not a big fan of this item. The materials are flimsy, scratchy, and don't seem particularly stable or durable. Fisher Price makes a higher quality line called Papasan, which I highly recommend."
3,"Great for newborns and Toddlers, not older babies","My mother in law has this seat and I thought I wanted one until this weekend, my second child is now sitting up and officially hates this chair. It doesn't allow the baby to lie down (seated recline instead), and you also can't secure it in an upright position. So, my newly sitting but not quite steady baby was either uncomfortable because he was fighting the chair to sit up, or fighting not to rock. He loved it as a newborn though, and my toddler loves to sit in it when we're over."
5,My daughter loves it!,my two month old loves this bouncer the vibartion puts her right to sleep when she is tired and soothes her while she is playing with the toys on it. She loves the song the cow plays and if i play it while she is fussing she stops right away and smiles at it. I love how when she is a toddler it will turn into a rocker for her.
4,Great multipurpose chair,"I am a daycare provider. This seat is very good from tiny infant to over 2 year olds. I often use it when first feeding a baby solids so they are tipped back a bit (the gravity effect). It is also helpful to keep baby safe if I have to step out of the room for a moment - just be sure the ""kick stand"" is out so they can't tip it over (although if they are old enough or mobile enough they still can!). This chair is one of the favorites of all the children I care for - I am on my third one!"
4,Good chair for infants,"After our baby broke her bouncer (from excessive bouncing) we tried the rocker. She didn't seem to like sitting in it nearly as much as her previous bouncer, but it worked until she outgrew chairs all together. The toys are great and we really liked how solid the chair felt."
4,Good one!,"My baby is 10 months old. He doesnt want to sit in the rocker,but likes to stand and play with the toys which are attached to it. As suggested in the other review, its better not to use the rocker option for younger kids. For now, I put the stand and use it like a chair. Its a good place to engage the kids for some time, when we do house hold chores."
5,SO COLORFUL,"I GOT THIS FOR MY NEW GRANDDAUGHTER ,SHE LOVE ALL THE TOYS ATTACHED AND THE MUSIC .VERY WELL MADE THANK YOU"
5,Great chair for baby!,"I love this chair for my son. I purchased it when he was about two months old and have been using it on a daily basis. It worked nicely when he was tiny, and as he is growing, I still love it. It is easy to move throughout the house. I can easily slide it on the carpet to move it. It worked well for his first ""real food"" feedings since we could not quite sit up on his own yet, and was easy to wash to get the spilled food off. He likes the toy bar that is included, but I can also remove that and let him play with other toys. It does not take up too much room, and will last until he is a toddler. Overall, this is money well spent, and something I will probably purchase to give at the next baby shower I go to."
5,BEST BOUNCER!,"My now five month old daughter has used this from day one. Its steady so you can put a newborn in it, and now it rocks for her to have some fun. I also even feed her cereal in it, since it sits up in a good position. Also, our 4 year old loves to sit in it and rock when her little sister isnt using it. (The rocker can hold up to 40 pounds) I recommend it to everyone!"
3,Dangerous!,"My 5 month old baby has enjoyed this seat for 3 months now. It keeps him entertained and he likes the toys. Unfortunately, it is not safe to leave babies unattended. I did not have it on the rocker setting, so I thought it would be safe to leave him strapped in while I took a quick shower. About 8 minutes later, I came in to find his feet still strapped in but he had fallen completely forward and was dangling with his head an inch from the floor. If I had waited 2 more minutes to check on him, he could have wiggled his feet out and fallen on his head. So this is not safe just because the rocker feature is not engaged. Instead of the chair tipping forward, my baby was stuck dangling! I will still let him use it since he loves it but NEVER without supervision."
3,Can't leave older baby alone with chair,"I really like this bouncer because of how long it can be used. The reason I gave it three stars is that once your baby reaches toddler stage and can climb into the chair on her own, you have to really supervise and make sure they stay sitting. I turned my back one day for about a minute and my daughter had stood up in the chair. As I turned back, she grabbed the back of the chair and leaned so that the chair rocked back and she would have flipped over with it. Luckily I caught her in time. Now I don't let her use it unless supervised and make sure that she sits only."
2,DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF CHILD!,"A friend of ours got this ""wonderful"" rocker at her daughters 1st birthday. Since our twins outgrew their bouncy chairs, we thought this would be a lifesaver. NOT! Our smaller twin, 17 pounds, scooted herself out from the belt right in front of our eyes, not once, but twice. Another time she was doing a handstand in front of the chair. She bent completely forward and popped right out of the belt. Of course the belt is as tight as it could go without splitting her tummy! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR CHILD IN THIS SEAT!"
2,unsafe,"my daughter was one of those at about 12 months that leaned forward with the seatbelt buckled and she got stuck forward, but didn't fall. The seat fabric is not tethered to the back frame so they can pull the whole fabric seat part out of the frame/forward. The vibration setting rattled which was highly annoying. I had to stuff a soft toy between the vibration unit and the bottom of the seat. Got almost no use out of it and then it just became a place to put toys."
3,Before you buy this read my review there is a better style one,My sister has this seat and it is just ok ....its great that it turns into a toddler seat and baby seat but her son is two now and he figured out how to take the screws out of the sides and it is now broken so not so good...I on the other hand have this seat BUT it is a newer version and it is all plastic still rocks still turns into a todler seat and it also has legs to put down to stop the rocking and adjustable back to make it lay back more or sit up....and mine is awesome it vibrates and has a swinging toy bar. so before you decide to buy this one search for the plastic looking one i found mine at babies r us so it should be on here...i would def reccomend it....but this one is a little more hazardous
4,We got these for our twins,"We got two of these as baby shower presents and from the beginning, we found them very useful. As newborns, our boys were very comfortable laying in these chairs. We used them all the time and I definitely couldn't live without them. When I held one baby, the other baby was most likely in the chair.As the months went by, they learned to play with the toys and could entertain themselves for a long time! Now the babies are 7 months old and one is very active and curious and the other day he leaned so far forward to reach something that he toppled over! He wasn't hurt at all so it wasn't a big deal but now I can't put him in the chair anymore. His brother is the less active more mellow baby and he still sits in the chair fine although he's beginning to lose interest in the toys now. So these chairs are probably going to be put aside soon until they're big enough to get in and out by themselves. Up til now though, I have been very pleased with them!"
3,It's good for those that want to rock instead of a soothing bounce.,"I personally didn't care for this rocker. I was use to the traditional bouncy seat. So to go from a seat that bounces to one that rocks, I didn't like the transition. This would be good for an older child but not really an infant.The bouncing chairs bounced perfectly for what my daughter likes. It calmed her perfectly. Although in this rocker chair I couldn't calm her by rocking. It just wasn't soothing. I couldn't rock it smoothly. The colors aren't very pretty in my opinion either.I gave it a 3 to be fair. It was made nicely, a good contrsuction. I didn't feel it would fall apart. Overall, I just didn't care for it, and neither did my daughter. She preferred her bouncy seat. For us, it was a wasted purchase."
2,ok - but nothing special,"My daughter spent minimal time in this chair as an infant. Now at 10 mo. she's too little to use it as a toddler chair, and too big (mobile!) to use it as infant chair. The toys (hanging animals) have entertained her more detached from the chair (I now keep them in her toy box). Two of the animals are two-sided, but when seated in the chair, the one-sided cow faces away from her. (I don't understand why manufacturers do this!)I've heard from some friends that bouncy chairs worked miracles on their fussy infants, but that was never true for us."
5,My son loves it!,Works great. Entertains my 2 month old. Vibrations are so quiet we often accidentally leave it on even when we've removed our son. Also great for naps as a newborn or for sleeping while traveling.
4,Cant get the duck to play -how hard do you have to pull,Just got this -easy to put together! Love it but the duck will not pull?
3,Fixing problems,I had tough time fixing this one. The screw holes are not aligned. I had to give up fixing one of the screw.
4,We like it so far...,"We've had this since the baby shower. I chose it because I thought it would be nice if lasted until toddlerhood. My son is now 8 1/2 months. He doesn't use it much right now (but if I do, I'll look out for the tipping!), but he really liked being upright from NB until a couple of months ago. Two things I didn't like for little babies- he couldn't bounce like a ""bouncy seat"" would, and when he was very small (1-2 months) we had to use a rolled up blanket to support his head so it wouldn't flop side to side. On the upside, he loved looking at the toys (they were too far to reach for a long while), and he enjoyed finally figuring out how to press the music button."
5,Wonderful,"I had this for my son who is almost 12 now! He used it until he was 5. He absolutely loved his chair! Now, I have a 20 month old daughter who has the chair and loves it but doesn't like sharing it with her 3 month old sister ;). I've always wondered why fisher price has always made this chair in blue?!?!? Then yesterday, I saw they are coming out with a pink one February 15, 2011!!!! FINALLY!!!!! So I've preordered it for my girls!!!!! I cannot wait for it to get here and I know it will get years of use!!!!"
5,perfect,"I brought this chair for my grandchild,so he could sit up and watch his shows and play with his toys, i love it sooo much it rocks, recline,and one of the toys play music. keeps him very busy, when he sees the chair he gets very excited, i really recommend this chair!"
4,great buy,"love this chair. its well built, easy to clean and makes life a lot easier. my only complaint is that the seat only has two adjustments and they aren't too much different from each other. ones reclined and the next click up is only a tad bit higher."
5,Our baby loves this!,"Great value. Our 2-month-old loves looking at the toy bar, and he loves being able to rock himself in the rocker. We love that it is easily portable and multi-functional."
4,Great product,"This bouncer/rocker is a great addition to your baby supplies. My daughter sleeps so well in it. It converts to a rocker, so it will be around the house for a while. At the price, this product is a must have. My only complaint is that the batteries in the vibrating portion of this product go out too quickly, but that could be in part of how much we UAE it."
4,Good Product,"We started our son in this when he was a little over three months. It took a little time but now when you put him in it and start to put the bar in with the three little toys, his eyes light up and he shakes with excitement. He has learned how to pull the center one to make it play. One of my most favorite features? The music is quiet. So he can pull it and pull it and it never really gets annoying.The only thing I don't like is the big picture of the panda on the seat. He tries to turn himself around to see the colorful panda and twists himself like a pretzel.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone."
2,does not support babys head from the sides,This rocker is cute but does not support babys head from falling to the side. Not suitable for infant. My baby is 11lbs. When he sits in it his chin touches his chest and it looks uncomfortable. Im sure he will grow using it but not now...
4,Terrific product,"My parents bought this for my daughter as a place to sit downstairs (we have 2 levels in our home). She takes her naps in it, and we used it as a ""bed"" for her when we had to use a bilirubin blanket for her to treat her jaundice (it was much easier doing that than trying to set the blanket up with her crib). It is also useful for feeding. When we had hot weather, it was more comfortable for her to sit in it to be fed than for one of us to hold her and feed her. I don't really use the calming vibrations for her, but it's a nice option to have!"
5,"Great price, great Rocker!","With our first son, we had the fischer price soothing massager. He was very fond of it, so we kept it for the next one. Our newest addition likes it, but just loves the Infant Rocker by Fischer Price. Our sitter has this at her house and he always was sitting in it when I'd get there to pick him up. We decided to get it for the house and are glad we did. My three year old likes it too since as a toddler, he can sit in it and watch tv when his baby brother isn't using it. Very sturdy and worth the money."
5,He loves it!,"We looked everywhere for this item after seeing it out-of-stock at Babies R Us. At 3 months old, my son was able to pull the handle and make the music on his own. Now at 4.5 months he can pull the toys off. He has a ball with it. It keeps him occupied and I can get things done! Great product!"
5,infant to toddler rocker,"I purchased the fisher price infant to toddler rocker for my 1 month old grandson and he loves it. being it can be set to vibrate also calms him when he is fuzzy. its so colorful with all the toys and colorful fabric that it keeps him intertained with all the bright colors to look at, helping with his ability to see all the different colors. what it best about it is it will be able to be used also as he grows into a toddler as a chair or rocker. great item."
5,this is useful for years,"My daughter is now more than two years old and has used this chair every day since she was born, practically. It started as a safe place for us to put her while we were doing things, and she could watch the action going on in the house. As she developed, she could take advantage of the features. The toys on the toy bar were fascinating until she started to crawl. We used it to feed her in when she was just starting to eat, before she was big enough for a high chair. Now she loves to rock in it and watches dvds or reads books in it. This is a great item to have."
4,Perfect for 2nd baby with a toddler,I wanted this because I knew my 2 year old would try to sit in or play with anything this baby had. She is 33 lbs so I needed something that would take that weight and be functional for my newborn.My son will sleep GREAT in it while in the reclined position. My Daughter loves to rock in it.The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because I see that it has stability issues. I have had to teach my daughter not to lean on it when my son is in it because it will tip fairly easily. I noticed the newer rocker Fisher Price made seems thicker in the legs which may be more stable. But other than that this is an awesome chair for our kids.
5,Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker,"I really like this Fisher Price Infant to Toddler rocker, I have bought one for each of my two nephews and this one is for my new grandson. It is great that they can use it for such a long time. Money well spent for this item."
2,Boring,"I had this chair for my son and vowed I would never buy it again when I have another child. This chair was only good for rocking and it seemed most of the time I had to do the work... if the child throws himself back, it doesnt give or spring back like a normal bouncer would. The stationary part came handy sometimes. The hanging toys didnt seem very entertaining. They come off when pulled, seemed that they can only be slapped around."
1,I want une book for my use,I want if is posible the e-mail adress of Peter Gruber becouse i want to ask him about a soft problem. I need the last versione of program untis for schedule becouse i own an old version of this program Thank you for understanding
3,Missing pages? Good but not great (a la Claremont),"I agree somewhat with the reviewer who asked if pages were missing. I thought the first 3 comics in this collection were quite amazing, but then the series begins to stumble. F.Q. is replaced by someone else whose art is not quite as refined, but aside from that, the story, specifically in the fourth issue, is garbled and confusing. After that, the comics are up and down from issue to issue.Overall, the first three issues were spectacular and then hit-or-miss. I suggest checking this out, and I'll probably check out Volume 2, but if it's as inconsistent, I'm done.As for the comparison to Chris Claremont, there really is no comparison. Claremont's run with Byrne was mind-blowingly amazing. Without Byrne, it was nearly as good. If Morrison can attain a level of consistency, time will tell if he deserves his name in the same sentence as Claremont."
5,I CAN ACTUALLY READ THE X-MEN!!!,"To say Grant's New X-Men was a breath of fresh air would be an understatement. For the first time in forever I opened a X-Men book and wasn't completely lost in two pages. Grant has reinvigorated these characters and made the franchise brand new and exciting like only he can! Step aside Claremont and Byrne, these X-Men stories will detonate your current work to dust."
4,You just can't lose,"At first glace, this seems like a miracle. Grant Morrison, one of mainstream comics' more creative thinkers and one of my personal favorites, on the X-Men, my absolute favorite comic as a child.It starts off slowly enough; the first issue was anticlimactic for me. But it picks up after that, in fact, it picks up and falls hard enough to destroy one of Marvel's weirdest countries.There's the standard Morrison twists, as his work is always in the details, like the devil. He pares down the X-Men into a manageable 5 members and focuses on them, which is a nice change in gears for Marvel's foremost title.Frank Quitely being involved elevated this project into the stratosphere. Quitely unique style seems to mesh well with whatever Morrison comes up with, and his run on X-Men is no exception. There are some fantastic pages, of that there's no doubt.If you like either Morrison, Quitely or the X-Men, you should definitely give this a shot if only to satisfy your burning curiosity."
3,Didn't Do It For Me...,"No intended disrespect to Mr. Witherspoon, but this compilation is just o-kay. I don't know if it's the audio production or if it's the songs themselves. I was expecting something to move me more than this. I understand this is dated music, and I knew what I was buying, but I was really hoping for some ""hotter"" tracks. ""Move Me Baby"" is, to me, the stand out track."
2,Too weak and boring,"This cd is just.. jazz, classic jazz. Nothing of new, no experimentations. Casale's voice is original and ""weak"" much enough to renmain in your mind after having listened the cd, but.. the fact is that it's very hard to arrive to the end: ""Jazz In Me"" is boring after 3/4 tracks yet, it immediately sounds ""already listened"" and monotone. And the solos are useless and boting, really really boring. I suggest you buying Casale's new ""Bille Holiday In Me"", even if it's a little bit more expensive."
3,A Notable Lapse,"While I found the book very informative about the subject I was amazed to find a curiousOmission. Granted that the coverage is mainly about American authors,the bookIncludes write-ups about some British authors too.Then why the omission of RichmalCrompton whose William books were the ultimate Boy's books for half a century fromThe 1920s to the 1960s? Strangely enough she does not get an entry even in the detailedIndex. Simply not cricket Ms Silvey!"
3,Good but also Puzzling,"I think its strange that the most important writer of childrens books Lewis Carrol is treated with an avarage amount of attention in this otherwise great book.Not that I am his biggest fan or a fanatic collector. But Carrol is so crucial to the genre that one cannot escape from it.OK his bio seems a bit controversial but the seedy stuff is still unproven. And yes others are important too. But he is one of the main three influences on childrens books.How can the editor give him the same treatment (as in amount of text) compared to much lesser writers mentioned in this book?People noone has heard of ever get the same number of words as Carroll, its unforgivable.Carrol is for literature like Richard Wagner for classical music. Just too crucial if you wanted to avoid them."
5,Picky Eater Can't GET ENOUGH,"I have an extremely picky treat eater ( dog ) and this is one of the very few treats she actually sits anxiously waiting for me to open the jar to give her one, or two, or three--well-you know how it goes. The product is on the soft side so it is not good to use if you need to keep your dog occuppied for awhile but you can break off pieces and carry them in your pocket to use as training treats."
5,An absolute must have,My 2 month old just loves his Sleep Pooh. I am so glad I got this after reading some of the reviews. My little one just drifts off to the music and when he wakes intermitantly I don't have to bother him by entering the room. I just use the remote to start up the music. What a wonderful bedtime asset!
2,Too loud for little ears!!,"This was a gift for my son, and I thought it would be great. However, the ""singing Pooh"" was just too loud!! There is no volume control, and I tried to muffle it with tape and extra blankets. All it has managed to do is startle my son rather than soothe him. I would recommend the Ocean Wonders Aquarium over this product! My son loves the sound of the ocean and the songs, and it has a volume control! I gave the toy 2 stars for durability, but not sure how good that is since we don't use it."
1,scarey pooh,this toy is so loud that instead of helping my daughter sleep it makes her cry untill it is not only off but out of sight. even though it was a gift it was a waste of money!
5,Pooh is a hit in our house,"I bought the ""Sing Me To Sleep Pooh"" after the birth of my premature son. Another parent in the NICU nursery had purchased it for thier child to keep near his incubator and I was so impressed with the length of the music and the sweet voices of the characters I decided to buy it for my son also. Since we couldnt put the toy into his bed we sat it next to him and played it through out the day. When he came home we put it on the shelf of his crib and played it everytime he went to sleep. He is two years old now and he still has it on his crib and occasionally takes it down himself to restart the music and listen to the characters talk. We still turn it on everytime he gets into his crib for a nap or bedtime and he wont sleep if its not turned on. One of my sons first words was ""Pooh"" and his first toy was this wonderful musical one."
5,Baby's favorite,"First, thank you Amazon.com & Jeff Bezos for allowing customers to review all your items. I purchased this among other toys for Christmas for our 7 month old grandchild (thanks to reviewers). It stays in the crib for nap or bedtime. When she wakens once or twice a night, she makes a bit of sound, then starts the music herself & settles back to sleep. Obviously her tired mother is delighted with this outcome. I am buying this for every future baby shower & telling all grandmothers about it."
3,Disappointed!,"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter so that she would have something to play with in her crib that she can operate herself. I introduced the toy and turned it on, and it scared her! The music is way too loud for a lullaby toy. My daughter is very adventurous and easygoing, so it's like she is just nervous. This toy needs a volume adjusmtent, because it seems more likely to WAKE a baby than sing one to sleep. The pillow is very hard too. I was excited about this toy because it looked so cute, but it was a disappointment."
4,Cute but loud,All in all this is a very cute toy and the songs are adorable.My one gripe would be that the speaker is LOUD. I ended upputing a layer of masking tape over the speaker (inside the pillow) and now it's at a sound level that works for my sons ears.
2,"Songs/Music good - do not consider this is a ""toy""","I received this as a gift from a friend with the birth of my first child. My daughter did not enjoy it until she was about 6 months old when I would sing the honey bee song to her before she went to bed. That lasted a couple of months until we moved on to another bedtime routine. Never used the ""remote"". Good memories but pillow is now separated from Pooh and remotes is ???"
4,Good Toy,"We were given this toy by a neighbor who could hear my colicky daughter screaming four houses away! For her first four months my daughter would go from happily sleeping to completely miffed in the blink of an eye and would get so worked up she wouldn't even see all of the toys in her crib. Now, at 6 months old, she's beginning to play in her crib for a few minutes when she wakes up and especially loves the Piglet attached to this toy. I would give it 5 stars if it had a volume control. It'll scare the daylights out of adults and babies alike if it gets bumped and goes off in the middle of the night."
2,Not good for us,"I guess it depends on how your child falls asleep, but this toy did not work out for us. We had a hard time getting the remote to work from any distance where my son wouldn't notice us and he sometimes bumped it in his sleep it would turn on and wake him up. He liked to play with it while he was awake but not that often. We used it maybe 10 times. Not worth it for us."
4,My son loves this toy!,My son has loved this toy and it has hepled him to sleep ever since he has been an infant. It is very easy to take with us when he has to sleep over at grandma's house.
5,Baby and Mommy and Daddy love this toy!,"My sister-in-law bought this toy for my son for this his first Christmas. He loves it!! My husband and I love that it comes with a remote so we can turn it off from another room, when the baby is asleep. I have to make everyone laugh --- IT HELPS US TO GO TO SLEEP ALSO!I GREATLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!!"
3,i don't like the hard plastic pillow unit,"I like everything about this. I was given this at a shower although it was not on my registry. The music is great and it helps put her to sleep sometimes, but she has hurt herself on the plastic once so I won't be using it anymore at night time, just during the day."
1,You can't kill it!,"My daughter recieved this for a Christmas gift and has hated it from day one! I think the music is too loud to try to sleep to. It is very durable no mater how much my 10 month old pulls/yanks/ steps on/ and beats it, it does keep going. She does enjoy the rattle & shake pooh but this one is a toy box sleeper!"
4,Great for baby!,I bought this for my son who was 5 months old at the time. He absolutely loved it. He likes to play with it while he's in the crib and even learned how to turn it on (by tapping a specific spot). I also play it when he wakes up in the middle of the night. It usually lulls him back to sleep. Outstanding crib toy.
3,Bedtime soother?,I really wanted this item so I registered for it and received it at my shower. We opened the box that night and put it over in the crib. I'm glad my son was not born yet or in the crib. I have my son's crib in my bedroom and my husband was changing channels with the TV remote and Pooh turned on and when we changed channels he would change songs and/or cut off and on. Apparently the toy is on the same signal as our television. My 12yr old likes Pooh so we gave the toy to her for her room.
5,Doesn't last long,"I bought this toy for my son to listen to at bedtime and naptime. He loves the toy and it puts him right to sleep. But I have only had it for 3 weeks and had to replace the batteries 2 times already. It only gets played 3 or 4 times a day so I can't say it is being used more than expected. I was very surpirsed to see an infant toy made to drain batteries so quickly. I am even using expensive, brand new, batteries. It is a shame because this toy is adorable and my son loves it, it's just costing a fortune already!"
5,Life Saver for Cranky Babies!!,"I received the Sing Me to Sleep Pooh for my baby shower and thought nothing of it. But, this little bear was a life saver. My daughter was very colicky during the first three months and hearing the soft voice and music seemed to ease her anxiety and stress. She drifted effortlessly off to sleep whenever I played it for her. I didn't believe something like this could work, but it seemed to. Be careful not to have your little one become too dependent on it once he or she is a little older, but for newborns, it seems to soothe them."
2,Light Sleepers - Forget It!,"While this toy is cute, it is much too loud and does not have a volume control. We received it as a gift for our 9 month old baby - it hindered her sleep. She plays with it during the day and likes to turn it off and on and watch the stars light up. But, we never use it at night. It was particularly disturbing to our 4 year old who shares a room with the baby."
4,One of the best gifts I got!,"This wasn't on my baby registry but I got it as a gift. My daughter falls to sleep with it every night. The music lasts just long enough and the light dims at a good pace. Now that my Daughter is 6 months old and is moving around in her crib, she can hit it and the music starts up and will lull her back to sleep! I love this toy so much I'm buying one for my sister in law and one for my friend who are both having babies soon. I use it so much I've had to change the batteries in it twice already! Great gift for any mom to be!"
3,Too loud,"My daughter received this toy as a gift for Christmas. My husband and I both think it is very cute, but I think it is much too loud to put in her crib. I would love this gift if it had a volume switch."
2,"Light sleepers, beware!","I know that a lot of people love this toy, but I think it is too loud to be soothing. I let my daughter have it in bed for about a week, and it woke me up in the next room every time it went off. I am a light sleeper, though, so it might not be a problem for everyone. Sometimes it woke her up, if she just happened to bump it in her sleep. I also think it is too heavy to be a good baby toy. I let my kids play with it as a regular toy, but by the second or third song I'm always pleading ""Turn it off!"" I just find the songs to be annoying. I was disappointed, because I'm a huge Pooh fan, and I had heard such great things about this toy."
2,Sing Me to a Temper Tantrum Pooh,"I bought this when my daughter was about five months old, mostly based on the great reviews it got on Amazon. I was hoping it would help her get to sleep. It did nothing, she hated it. We tried for several weeks. It got to the point when she heard it go on she started screaming. At that age too she was getting to the point where she could accidently pull it on to herself. Maybe if I tried when she was a little younger it might have worked.I gave it two stars, because it is a cute toy, the voice and the song appealed to me (if not my daughter) and it seems well made."
4,love the toy but too loud,"I was so excited that i received this toy at my shower. I couldn't wait to use it. I waited until my son was in his big crib (about 3 months). He loves to grab at the light on the pillow and it definitely keeps his attention. The music choices are very good also - Pooh sings a song and then there is a musical lulliby playing whichs slowly quiets down to soft animal noises. my only complaint is that the volume is too loud, and there is no way to adjust it. I only use it with my son when he is awake to amuse him. If i use it when I am putting him to bed he cries. It is loud enough that I worry it could damage his sensitive ears if actually put it in the crib with him. (I usually use it on the floor while he is on his playmat) It would be a full 5 stars if only I could fix the volume!!"
5,A must have!!!!!!,"Like all new moms I bought a matching mobile to place over my son's crib to help him fall asleep. Unfortunately, the mobile only played for a minute or two and then I would have to wind it up again, which would prevent him from falling asleep. The sing me to sleep Pooh was a perfect solution. Not only does it play longer than most mobiles you can restart it using the remote, so you don't disturb your baby. Another plus is that you can move it from room to room, which is great if your baby sleeps in a bassinet. My son loves the to watch Pooh as he sings him to sleep. This is a must have!"
4,Shower Chair,"I was happy to purchase this from Amazon because it was half the price of the catalog the physical therapist showed me. The only problem I have is that sometimes the one leg comes off, not while I am sitting on it though. It is easy to put back on. Otherwise, I am very happy with it."
4,Good lighting +comforting night light,"Purchased this lantern more than a year agoColeman Retro Battery Powered Lantern (Family-Size). Like it so well I'm buying another as a present for a friend down the road.It's a boon companion during our many power outages (six miles from Seattle as the crow flies, and light years away in electrical service reliability.) Perhaps harder to store due to its size, but puts out enough light to read by even at ""low"" setting. I find the night light a real comfort during overnight outages. Yes, the battery setup is cumbersome and it takes 8 D cells, but I've only changed them once so far...a good track record considering multiple outages."
2,Not so good,This lantern does throw bright light. BUT it does not have a long battery life. It is also prone to go out when walking with it. I think the batteries shift around.
5,Beautiful bells,"I bought these as a gift for someone and misplaced them. I gave her something similar instead. Eventually they were found I kept them for myself as they sound soooo lovely. Beautiful tinkling sounds, I have music wherever I go!"
2,2 stars,"Giulia's life was a long, often sad one, and as she looks back upon it, she relates how she fell in love with her first husband to their grandchild. It is a saga filled with pain as child after child is lost early in life and Giulia is widowed at a young age, but finds love once again.** If you are a fan of sagas, but short on time, you may enjoy this. The pace is slow and rambling and there is little character development. However, it does give insight into a particular era in United States history from the point of view of a little heard from segment of society. **Amanda Killgore"
3,One song but the rest is for the afficionados,"Electric Los Angeles Sunset is amongst the best songs of Al Stewart and this record is a good addition to the collection. I would however only recommend it to real fans of this under-estimated artist. Casional listeners should download the one great song and instead buy Orange and Past, Present and Future."
5,Author Ohrbach,"I really like any book by this author. She has a sensibility about antiques, and scent that propel me to try new things. If you are interested in displaying your antiques, this is a wonderful idea book."
2,If you are tired of the mundane,"As the title implies this album can go several different directions. The over all appeal should speak volumes in the listeners mind, and reach a special place in the recesses of the odd at heart. Try this one if you want for something out of the ordinary!"
1,Mundane and mediocre,"Beautiful cover, but nothing inside.I'd hoped for something grand and rich along the lines of ""Bomarzo"", but this is just another tacky romance-novel masquerading as something finer. And boy, is it ever tacky!Guaranteed to make you laugh out loud in all the wrong places, I wonder if this was written as a prank by a couple of Harvard undergraduate males instead of the lush babe in the author photos.But as the Kirkus Reviews pointed out, it will probably sell like hotcakes..."
5,Super Summer Reading!,"Just the kind of fun, exciting, can't-put-it-down book I love to help me escape the daily grind. With smart, funny characters displaying superhuman heroism, The Stargazer delivers everything you want from a romantic mystery. Can't wait for Jaffe's next!"
1,So much potential...,"...so little fulfillment!This book had an interesting sounding plot, so I gave it a try. What a mistake. It was incredibly poorly written and had a plethora of characters introduced with no backstory and little character development. Neither of the main characters were likeable. I do not recommend it."
2,"Well, I'm not gonna read it again...","...But it has its good points, too. The plot is very interesting, the characters equally engaging, and the history well researched. The writing, however, leaves something to be desired. I can't quite put my finger on the problem, but there were numerous times when the story felt extremely unreal because of the way it was written. That said, I had no trouble finishing it, which I usually do when books suck. The end is predictable, but the plot never loses interest."
2,Disappointing!,"I was glad to read that other reviewers were disappointed by this book. I was impressed that the author has a degree in literature from Harvard University, and was looking forward to some really good writing. What I found instead were extremely weak characters, an unrealistic plot premise, and sex scenes that were graphic enough to distract from the story, yet seemed to contain no emotion. I would not call this book a romance. I bought the paperback in a bookstore, and I am really wishing I could have the 6.99 back to spend on a different book!"
2,Mixed feelings--could have been much better.,"Now I know why you should always read real reader's reviews before buying. The concept of this book is great. The lush setting and potentially interesting characters all made me eager to read STARGAZER, but, much to my chagrin, it turned out to be a bodice ripper in disguise. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down. Jaffe has a way of pulling you in, making you need to know the outcome of the story, despite the annoying ""love"" scenes that appear at every turn. If Jaffe had kept to the mystery (or even left a bit more to the imagination withthe lvoe scenes), it would have been a much better novel. We ""get"" that Ian and Bianca are sexually compatable--let's move on!"
5,"I'm starstruck by Stargazer, bravo bellisima!","Clearly well researched, historically accurate, and brilliantly written, Jaffe's first book affords the reader not only enough gratuitous sex scenes to make the most seasoned romance novel readers sweat, but a clever and absorbing plot, brilliant verbal jousting, and strong character development. Far from the norm for the genre of romance novels, this is by far the best I have ever read. Jaffe manages to combine mystery, sensuality, intensity, and history, with a feminist heroine who no woman could fail to admire. Steele, Greeley, and the rest, beware - Jaffe is clearly an author to watch for. My only question: how soon can I get my hands on her next novel (and my own Ian!)?"
1,"All hype, no book...","This is an emporer's new clothes book -- if readers are impressed by all the fuss and money the publisher is throwing at this book, then they're bound to love it. Well, guess again!This is a barely acceptable historical of the bodice-ripping kind, with vile characters, historical gaffes galore, and plot holes as big as the Grand Canal -- which is about as close as you'll get to Renaissance Venice reading this tripe. Don't waste your time..."
5,terrific read!,"I don't know who those people are wingeing on about million dollar press campaigns -- a good read is a good read and Michele Jaffe's STARGAZER is a terrific read! From the opening chapter's star-crossed meeting between Bianca & Ian (if she gets you wondering about Bianca's most un-romantic sneezing I know you will love the rest already), through the steamy sex scenes and wonderful details of sixteenth century life to the nail-biting end, the author gives you a book which is mystery, romance and history all in one. I just can't decide if I want Miles or Tristan to turn up in her next book, WATERNYMPH, but I know I can't wait to read it. If you like strong dialogue, stronger characters and far-away locations, you will love STARGAZER."
1,Groan.,"I wasn't impressed. The plot was very contrived and the characters just didn't seem real to me. Their emotions seemed all out of whack with their experiences. And the heroine's sneezing becomes this big plot point-- it's all kind of silly.I hope the young author took the money and ran with it, because it's nice to see an author who makes a mint. But I hope next time she gets an editor who is willing to challenge her."
2,Hard to follow and far to sexually graphic,"Unfortunately I found this book hard to follow. To many characters and I kept going back pages to figure out who was who. To me the love scenes were almost pornographic! I do not want that much detail! I also did not really figure out why the women got murdered, a bit confusing. However, I did enjoy the Italian location and the development of the characters and their relationships. I believe I would enjoy another book by Jaffe (perhaps about some of the brothers), but again without so much explicit sexual scenes."
1,Santa Catarina's head! What was all the fuss about??,"Okay, so maybe she does have a PhD, but can she write a good book? No! Skip this one, I wish I had."
1,Poorly Written,"I bought this book with high hopes and the first page was so bad, I knew I'd made a mistake. Because of the price, I kept reading and was shocked by just how bad the writing was in this book. It's petty, trite, stilted, and the purplest prose I've ever read."
1,"Silly, implausible, badly written.","I am finding this book almost impossible to finish. I would throw it away, but I paid a lot for it and I am one of those people who has to finish even a rotten book just to see how bad it can get."
1,The Stargazer,"Absolute rubbish. Character are immature and stilted. You cannot like any of them. Supposedly, the male lead is of a superior intellect. It's hardly visible in this author's dialogue. Could not finish."
5,This is the best Romance I've ever read!,"I've been reading Romances for years, but Michele Jaffe's book really stands out from the crowd. So much of this genre is generic drivel, but Jaffe distinguishes herself with tight plotting, intriguing characters, and the sort of historical detail that is rare in its insight and depth. Not to mention the romantic tension! Great reading -- can't wait for her next book."
3,not a romance,I had great hopes for this new writer. I was disappointed that the characters were completely shallow. There was no love making after 11 chapters of pure smut I decided I had dedicated enough time to it. I have no idea how it ends and frankly I do not care.
1,Sneezed me to sleep...,"Whenever I read a five-star review of this book where the reader gushes by saying: ""Beautifully written,"" and/or ""historically accurate, lush, vivid, etc.,"" all I can think is that Ms. Jaffe has a lot of terrific friends out there, or that these reviewers have never read past Jackie Collins. The Stargazer is FAR from beautifully written or well-crafted, (Hello point-of-view???, hello style? Hello good writing???) and the editor knows it. But a Ph.d and long, flowing hair that holds a curl do make for a nice package. Alas, Kathryn Lynn Davis (a Pocket romance author who truly is a word-artist) has a new book coming out soon and I'm thrilled about that. I really wanted to like the Stargazer, but it's so poorly written, it's offensive. Sorry."
1,Disappointed.,"After seeing all the adds for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Maybe it was because my hopes were too high that I was disappointed. I felt the plot was implausible. The two main characters are presumably very intelligent people. Then why do they come up with the silly scheme of the heroine pretending to be the hero's betrothed while he tries to figure out if she's a murderer? Since the whole book was based on this premise, I could never get into the rest of the plot. And, unfortunately, their love scenes weren't romantic. In fact, I felt the plot was manipulated so that more sex scenes could be added. Ms. Jaffe did do a good job with the seamy scenes with the villains, but I'm afraid these well-drawn characters didn't make up for what was lacking in the hero and heroine. I'll probably wait until I get some feedback from other readers before reading the next book."
1,That's what I get for buying a book for its cover!,"This book contained some of the worst writing I've ever seen published. The scenes were choppy and unrelated. The characters were flat, and even then they were inconsistent. The tone of the book switched from page to page so you never knew what you were to be feeling. The sex was jarring and emotionless. I won't even mention the lack of (or perhaps disregard of) historical research that was evident. I threw my copy away so no one else would have to suffer at my hands. If you want a good historical romance about Venice try Susan Wiggs' Lord of the Night."
1,Simply a mess!!!,"This ""simply"" has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I can say that I seriously considered dropping this one in the trash! However I perservered and found this: an extremely choppy mess with a rushed onset-pressing an excessive amount of secondary characters before we had even been introduced to the primaries. ""Simple"" me had figured out the killer after the first introduction to the cousin and the ending was long-overstated with a blunt ending of the harsh herione finally saying the ""I love you"". At first I was excited-the setting-Venice-rare not your typical ""ton"" atmosphere. I was extremely disappointed about the form of the text-shocked the author is a Harvar graduate-seen better writing in high school. The reasons I gave it one star-the scenery-sadly wasted on this book. Too bad she couldn't have applied this discription to the characters. The sex was hot-but if I wanted strait erotica I would have picked several other authors. Overall-""Simply"" disappointed."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Having just read, Judith McNaughts' ""Whitney My Love"", which I would rate 10 stars for content and thorough enjoyment, The Stargazer was a BIG disappointment. There was no romance, not even kindness coming from Ian so how a gentlewoman of that period could find lovemaking with him so enthralling is beyond my comprehension. The highly descriptive lovemaking would seem more in tune with a Hustler or Playboy magazine. I do applaude a first effort but I would rather a bit more romantic hero instead of one you'd like to punch in the face!"
2,Where's the romance?,"Very disappointing novel...wish I had paid paperback price. The plot was interesting so I was hooked, but as I read I became disenchanted. I enjoy a intelligent heroine and was disappointed that Bianca could be so consumed by sex (not love) that she often forgets to work on solving the mystery. (My heroine would be able to say ""I love ya, but I've got a murder to solve."") Also the love scenes were in my view pornographic. This is where romance novels differ than other love/mystery novels in my opinion. Romance is that mysterious element between two characters, eye contact, tingling sensations, etc. I do not understand why so many good authors must describe the sex scenes so graphically...is this to sell books? Ms. Jaffe's book is entertaining, but her characters were inconsistent (not believable). Her sexual scenes were too graphic and too often distracted from the plot. I wish I had my money back."
4,external coil requirement,"This coil--and I assume other MSD coils with an external power input--will only work with an external coil. There is no clear way to use this coil with the stock ignition coil setup on a Honda Civic.Looks like a nice item, but I did not test it out, because I was planning to use the standard internal coil, and I wanted to return the item in the sealed packaging in which it arrived. The package was clear plastic, so that's how I could confirm that this distributor cap would not work with the stock ignition coil--while at the same time keeping the package intact for return to Amazon."
4,A little on the small side,"I would not be able to wear this, it's very smallish, but it fits my daughter perfectly!!She loves it!!"
3,pretty but catch does not work,"This is a really pretty bracelet, the stones are very light in color, not quite as nice as pictured, but still pretty and I would keep it except the bangle has a catch system which simply will not stay closed so I have to send it back."
2,Theory and Conjecture,"Jean-Michel Carré is the same producer who produced the well made PUTIN SYSTEM documentary. The problem with his work is presents a series of theory and conjecture and presents it has fact. This documetary is well made and does present some compelling evidence but most of the evidence is weak at best. This documentary states An American Torpedo sunk the Kursk, thus explains the wound in the Kursk but American sub torpedos explode under their targets not through them. Most studies done on this tragedy blame torpedos which had weld issues which could cause them to leak fuel in the subs silos thus causing them to explode. We will never know the complete truth but the problem with this documentary like The Putin System is that it is theory and conjecture which tries to present itself as established facts."
3,"Not the experience of the film, but what could be?","John Russo's novel version of the genre classic is a decent enough horror thriller, but considering the greatness of the movie this cannot be considered high praise. Great stills in the silver jacketed Pocket Books edition though."
4,mean and nasty,"One ugly little weirdo of a film, but poignant in an underbelly sort of way. Interesting story with an unexpected twist at the end. I would definitely recommend it, but what can I say? My kid is in it!"
2,Eh....,Okay movie but not very good acting. It also had a very amateur quality to it. It looked interesting - I guess I was fooled by the description and trailer.
5,mind joggers! boo,"I am using this book as a sub, and not knowing what age group I will be working with, it is very helpful in the labeling of age appropriate activities."
4,SUB DELIGHT,"I am a retired teacher, now substituting. There are a lot of greagt ideas to use in the classroom for subs and regular teachers. I wish I had this book when I was a full time teacher"
4,It's a tin of marbles . . .,It's a big tin of marbles. It has lots of different colors and patterns and there are more than a few shooters. My kids have enjoyed them and I feel like they were a fairly good value.
5,I love this tea,I had been buying smaller boxes for a while and decided not to delay the inevitable during this latest refill. This is the best cinnamon tea I've ever had and I'm pretty much addicted to it.
4,"Yummy tea, some bags more potent than others","I love this tea. Its flavor is usually super potent (cinnamon and orange), although some of the 50 tea bags (which I store in a glass jar in my freezer) are more potent than others. I'll be buying more fairly soon. Yum. I wish it qualified for Free super saver shipping, though!"
5,Yum!,"For the third time, reviewing, yes, I will order this item as long as they have it. Warning: Habit forming, but worth it!!! I put the teabags in my thermos with a little sugar and perhaps another teabag of green tea and carry with me wherever I travel. Good picker upper."
5,Losing My Virginity,"It was a great inspiration to me as an entrepneur, abeit not so successful. Nevetheless, I enjoyed it so much I have suggested to many friends and employees that they read this one! His life has been a great adventure, a great inspiration to experience life to the fullest. Let every moment count."
4,The Ultimate Book On Bali ?,"This may not be THE book on Bali, but it seems to be the best book still in print... It covers all things balinese and more. It covers more than just the tourist stuff and talks about music, art, religion and the islands people. One of the best parts of the book is about the photographers mobile studio, which shows great photos of dancers and musicians. The book is from 1987, but does not seem dated. What I missed from the book was something on Balis wildlife, but the book ""Tanah Air"" is awesome and full of wildlife photos from all over Indonesia."
5,A point from a kid,i loved this book because it can teach you life lessons.The life lesson that it tought me was that you should not look at the worst in people ans that there is always some good.I think that you should read this book becausee if you love a good thrilling books that if filled with adventures then this is the book for you.
3,A Very Confusing Book about Great Depression,"This book was about a girl who found an arrowhead. She was moving to California because of the hard times during the Great Depression. She was going to have to leave her friend behind. So, she keeps the arrowhead to remember her home and best friend by. This book was hard for me to read because I'm not in to girlie books but war books. This book is a good book to show point of view. For example, each chapter is from one of the girl's point of view."
2,lousey spatula,"These spatulas melt really easily, and then warp. Not worth anything really. The handle is nice, but worthless with a melted spatula."
3,Need a finer edge - not good for cast iron,"These are HUGE! The head on the largest is a full 6"" x 5"" and the smaller 5"" x 4"". As others have said, they can't take very high temperature, beware, but if you need to flip something big, these will do the trick nicely. The large one is perfect for grilled cheese on large bread slices. Picks the whole thing up neatly so the sandwich doesn't collapse over the side of the spatula. However, the front edge of both spatulas is blunt, so you CANNOT scrape a product off cast iron or other non-stick grill surfaces. This is a big problem. I use them less than I thought I would because the edge just bumps into the cakes and shears them off above the crisp bottom, and that's a mess and a waste. If you have non-stick only, they're fine. The color is a deep red, the design very neo and smart."
3,disappointed,"In terms of size, these are some BIG turners. Not only the span of the turner but the handles are long. Bear that in mind when you have to store them. Personally, I like the size but my utensil drawer doesn't close unless I stuff them in there just so.They are more flexible than I'd expected, which, at times, has been a problem. Great for things like turning sandwiches and burgers. They are thick so sliding them under pancakes is a bit of a trick. They weren't all that useful for the intended purpose. I didn't have any better results using these turners than I do with a regular spatula.The edge melted on one while I was cooking. What's with them saying ""high temp"" as a feature? I wasn't even using all that high of a temp. That was a disappointment. All I did was push the turner face down across the pan and was surprised to see the edge curled on itself and melted and blackened.I wouldn't recommend this set."
4,A great introduction to Contact Juggling,"This book is the ultimate (and only, it seems) introduction to the magical world of contact juggling.Every movement is described in detail, with clear illustrations and hints. The book moves from simple one-ball tricks (the butterfly) to more complex multi-ball tricks (plane-breaking in the four-ball grab).Most of the tricks can be performed (if shakily) after only an hour or two of practice.The only fault that I have found with it, is that it breaks off with no hint as to where to find further instruction. It is not complete. There are tricks not detailed that are obvious to a person after a little thought.Otherwise a brilliant book, and well worth the money."
4,Lupita's story is a testament to all mandaderas whose stories are never told,"David Stuart's personal account of the time he spent in the Sonoran town of Guaymas would have remained relatively uneventful had he not met little Lupita, la mandadera. She is the story's emotional center, and Stuart's relationship with her undoubtedly changed him forever.I appreciate the author's anthropological style of narration even though I find it jumpy at times. The frequent Spanish translations are a nice touch. In general I believe a strong story subject can make up for not-as-strong writing, and Stuart's story is a powerfully moving slice of his life. A few descriptions are permanently embedded in my mind: one favorite is of Lupita with her trophy fish catch, a three-and-a-half-foot yellowtail, which she caught on an outing to Kino Bay in the Sea of Cortés.It's not often that I find myself so engrossed in a book that the world around me dissolves into a kind of tunnel vision."
5,This is a chronicle.,"As a chronicle, I would say the book is written exceptionally well. If it were a work of fiction, I would say the author failed to generate sympathy for the main character, himself. Because the chronicle is written so well, it may seem you are reading a fictional account that doesn't quite measure up. It is what it is. An exceptional recanting of a true story."
5,A Stinky Surprise,"Nate the Great is a cool detective who solves lots of mysteries. In this story he is trying to find out who is dumping Oliver's trash. We liked it when Nate the Great went undercover to solve the case. The best part was when Nate runs into a ""Stinky Surprise""! We think this is a great book for all second graders."
5,PERFECT FOR NEW READERS,All my granddaughters have loved the Nate the Great books. They can read them when the first start school.
2,Cold Potato!,If you are color blinded this is not a game for you! This game is based on matching up spuds with their mate before you get to the end of the level. Now their mate is the same color they are so you have to make sure you put blue with blue and green with green etc. If you like puzzle games pick Chuchu Rocket! Not Hot Potato!
2,boring,I cant believe nintendo cant make any better games than this I dont think this game even deserves the OFFICIAL NINTENDO SEAL OF QUALITY.
2,Oh please,This game is just another boring puzzle game. If you want a good puzzle game go get tetris or yoshi's cookie. Those are the classics(and best).
2,Tiring Game,"I just got the Gameboy Advance and wanted to purchase a few games for variety. I bought this game because of reviews given. I'll admit the game has it's cute points, is easy to learn, but to sum up in one word it is BORING. There are many other puzzler games that I have liked in the past and this game does not measure up."
4,Lillian Too's Chinese Wisdom is a Great Read !!,"This was an excellent book. It touched on a little bit of everything. It is a good foundation book if you are interested in learing about the Chinese culture. Lillian Too has a wonderful way of explaining things in a way that is easy to understand. I didn't like the part about face readings, but all the information on religions and Chinese astrology were just facinating. I didn't put the book down for two days and still reference alot out of it. A great read!!!"
4,Loved it!!!!,This worked perfect for my dauggter at my son'hawaiian theme grad party. It has velcro waist but it was still a little big in the waust. Other than that it was made beautifully and my daughter looked great it and she didnt want to take it off.
3,Cooking Dictionary,This dictionary is ok. It does not show the French pronunciation which was something I was looking for.
5,handy dictionary,We did not realize how often we would refer to this dictionary when we bought it; it is very handy to have in the kitchen.
2,Disappointing,"The usefulness of this book is compromised by its shallow treatment of a number of subjects that people might want to look up. Some of their articles are just wrong. For example, its article on absinthe states that it can cause convulsions, blindness and even death. But, although absinthe was vilified in the past, no evidence has shown it to be any more dangerous than ordinary liquor. Its psychoactive properties, apart from those of alcohol, had been much exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, when countries in the European Union began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale. It is now legal for sale in the U.S. There are many other examples of misinformation throughout the book. If one is to rely on it as a reference book, it should be more accurate."
5,Gripping Action Packed Novel,"This action packed novel keeps you on the edge of your seat through the final chapter. It's a riveting drama of mystery, manipulation, intrigue, romance, and pure human emotions. It's an entanglement of the worldwide Internet, the CIA, and one mans quest to find the answers. I can see ""WEB CRAZE"" in movie theatres in the near future. The author did an excellent job on his previous book ""Roadside Ron"", but he has out done himself on ""WEB CRAZE"". His descriptive writing makes you feel as though you are living the story. You'll want to read it more than once. Everyone on the Internet needs to read ""WEB CRAZE"". With all the new technology and the Millennium, this book will leave you wondering.... ""CAN THIS REALLY HAPPEN?"""
5,Austin and McMahon's hatred culminates in the End of an Era!,"The End of an Era match at Fully Loaded was the best match I have even seen. I have to admit I was rooting for McMahon because he makes the WWF so much better. This particular match kept my attention from start to finish. The interferences by Shane and X-Pac made the match that much better. With the result of Stone Cold winning, it left me happy for Austin, but sad for McMahon."
4,I thought this was a great PPV,"This was an awesome PPV. The Hardy Boyz vs. Acolytes match was awesome, the Hardy Boyz areawesome. The Hardcore match was really good and so was the Fully Loaded Strap Match. The tape has a great ending with the First Blood Match. The only bad matches are D'Lo Brown vs. Mideon because Mideon can't wrestle and the Mr. Ass & Chyna vs. X-Pac and Road Dogg wasn't that great. I thought it was the best ppv yet in 99"
4,rockin ppv,"THE 2 out of 3 falls match is great, the tag team title main event is one you're not gonna want to miss, the price is great , so buy it or you'll be sorry"
1,2nd Best WWF PPV of 99,"The middle part of the show sucked, but the beginning and ending portions were bordering on OK. The best match of the show was the handicap tag match. The show had two matches in the ** to *** range, three matches from * to **, and four DUDs. 2nd best WWF PPV of 99 that I saw, (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, Over The Edge, this show, No Mercy, and Armageddon) but that isn't saying much."
1,All style no substance,While this book has some nice pictures. There is very little actual information on setting up a natural aquarium.
3,Bland sixties product,"The Casuals were basically a one-hit wonder group with a catchy song called ""Jesamine."" This track is interesting for its syncopation and well-written tune. ""Toy"" was a decent follow-up single too. However, most tracks on this album display the distressing mediocrity of a record company trying to have a commercial hit, and not paying much attention to the artistry. Mind you, the singer can sing, and there is real talent here, but the production always sounds wishy washy, like a paint-by-numbers way of making a sixties record with an orchestra in the background. Some of the lyrics are hopelessly inane (""Hey hey hey, hear what I say"" - ""Hello, it's me, ooh it's easy to call you"") and some of the falsetto backing vocals teeter out of tune. One wonders what would have happened had these lads been given carte blanche to do whatever they liked, instead of being on the leash of a bunch of producers."
1,This book is a waste of money.,"The only insider insight given in this book is the suggestion to consider socks as accessories instead of underwear. Everything else is commonplace knowledge, that anyone able to look around and in a mirror can come up with on their own, unless, of course, they are into things like suspenders, cowboy boots and charm bracelets... I think the author should stick to describing animal habitats."
5,Great album,This is a beautiful album and one of my favorites so far. I have purchased many Keiko albums and find them all great.
1,Not the cage you think your getting,"I thought this was the Hana hut I had seen on birdcages4less.com. I wanted the green color so I bought this one instead. It is not the same cage, poor quality, and the bottom gate has a very large gap of 1"" between the side walls. My birds head could get stuck! Not as advertised. Find a better cage."
1,Pouring takes forever!,This gas can was purchased for long trips. The problem is the vent is built into the nozzle and it takes a VERY long time to pour the gas into my car. Would not recommend this product.
5,The absolute best toner for me!!,"Every toner that I have tried that they said was the best had Witch Hazel which dried out my face and left a rash. I love that this is cruelty free. Read the ingredients and decided to give it a try. Absolutely the most gentle and the best toner. It cleaned up the dead skin, minimized my pores and left my skin so soft. I will recommend it to anyone. I have used the same products for years and gave it up for this. I wanted something that would help tone and reduce the pores and leave it silky smooth. THIS IS IT!! I have sensitive skin and this is so gentle. I have used it for about 2 weeks my skin is so smooth and soft and brighter."
5,Beaty without Cruelty Toner,"The product smells good and leaves my face feeling clean. My face is looking even in tone . And does not burn my face alike other products I have tried, that is a plus for me. I do like this product quite a lot and I would buy it again."
3,Middling Japanese Porn,"The film was ruined by censoring each revealihng scene by shooting it theough a supplimentary lens to obscure it. The plot is not a bad attempt to get close to porn but fails to get there - thus it only titilates. A bit more honesty would have saved it from ""Pink"" statuswhich only implies dishonesty.Otherwise, the production values were good - lighting, sound, continuityand camera work."
4,Japanes Wife Next Door,Very very funny for an X-Rated movie. Usually subtitles during a movie takes away the enjoyment. This one didn't. Reiko is truly sexy and she can live next door to me anytime!!!! Look forward to seeing more of her films.
5,Crazy Orgy Action!,"If you're in the mood for insane sex explosions watch this movie!This movie has the incredibly amazing premise of choice, who do you choose? The straight laced girl or the wild one? Well businessman Takashi goes the wild road when he chooses Sakura, a crazed nymphomaniac with a never ending appetite that leaves Takashi sexually impotent and his family in a hilarious orgy fest.Granted sex is important in this movie, it's the main feature of the genre, but I like to think that there is a deeper message behind it all. Sakura constantly mentions how Japanese people are ""so behind on the times"" and how they are ""nothing like the forward thinking Americans"" do I smell satire? Watch and find out!"
1,Don't Buy This Movie,This movie would be good except that they blur out all the good scenes. Don't waste your money.
1,the japanse wife next door,I was very dissapointed in this movie a lot of the sex sence were blurid out.if I knowed that I would have not boughted it.
4,And what will hapen whit 6 and 7 then?,"OK, lets say I buy this 1-5 edition... ¿What will I do with 6 & 7 when released?Honestly, I would wait for the real ""COMPLETE"" collection.i consider this collection something like absurd.I voted for 4 stars because all 5 films are great, 5 is not THAT good, and thats why only 4 stars are on my vote."
1,Do Not Buy You Will End Up Returning IT,BEWARE Disk four was a mistake and they put a HDDVD instead of a bluray in the box. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,RIP OFF,"I basically got ripped off. I ordered the product and it arrived. However, the product I ordered was a DVD set that would not play on my equipment because it was HD-DVD. It is true that it clearly states on the ad THAT the product is HD-DVD, but not WHAT an HD-DVD is. I had NO IDEA. I later found out that the HD-DVD format was a DVD format that had been supported by Microsoft, the patron saint of lost causes and that the world stopped supporting it about three years ago.When I contacted the supplier, they told me that they would reimburse me, but that I would have to pay postage from Japan and that there would be a restocking fee. It would cost me MORE to get my money back than to just forget about it.The supplier is responsible and Amazon is also responsible for this. The ad on Amazon was misleading. There was important data missing from the ad and in that sense it was misleading.My advice to Amazon buyers is to read the description very carefully, or you may get ripped off too.John Davis"
2,Harry Potter 1-5 HD DVD Limited Edition set,"We Love the case it comes in. The book marks and cards are awesome. The movies will not play on our dvd player,blue ray player, computer or xbox 360. I guess you have to have some special dvd player to play them. Amazon will not refund your money. Very Poor customer service. This information should be placed on the detail page of the item so you know to go buy a special HD DVD player just especially to play these movies."
1,Incomplete set,"Um, whoever is wasting your money on a 'limited edition' set of 5 of the 7 Harry Potter movies is a stupid moron & should have their money taken away & managed by someone else. What are you gonna do when all 7 are released & the last 2 don't fit in this box? Please spare us the torture. This is like buying a 'limited edition' of Star Wars featuring episodes IV & V only. Lame, lame, lame. Buy the individual titles separately in my opinion. Limited edition my foot! The reason it's a limited edition is because when the 6th movie is released on dvd they'll make a 6 film 'limited edition' set to replace this current one. They can too, because of the morons out there who fund this junk by buying it up. Well, have another nice day."
3,Why widescreen?,"While I agree with several of the reviews in that it is frustrating to have a new limited edition released with each movie release, but it is ultimately the buyers choice whether to buy now or wait. My main beef is that all of the DVD's are being released in widescreen. My husband cannot watch widescreen movies...the wide screen causes problems with his vision. Also, not everyone can afford, or even desires to own a widescreen tv. However more and more movies and rental stores (such as hastings and movie gallery) are all widescreen. This puts those people who do not desire to own widescreen movies in the minority, and therefor we do not get to enjoy a diverse and enjoyable video collection. If you are going to take care to sell a dvd, especially a limited collection, in widescreen, hd dvd, and blue-ray you should certainly sell full screen!!!!"
1,Great Movies - Bad Format,"The low rater is for the format & timing, not the movies themselves. I am a big fan of the books and I think the movies are okay. I thought I'd buy the HD version so they'd look even better. Trouble is, I cannot find a HD DVD player that will play them. I've bought and returned three different systems with no luck. It also does not play on the XBox 360 HDDVD drive. Since HD has lost the HD vs. BluRay war, manufaturers are not wasting their time to put the updated firmware needed on their websites. So basically, I've spent good money on a fancy box of movies that I cannot watch."
1,2 discs are unplayable,"2 of my discs are unplayable. I thought it was my HD DVD player at fault but after trying it out at different players, it was the disc. The Discs that would not play correctly are discs #3 & #4. Too bad I can't get a full refund."
1,HD DVD NOT!!!,"Check your discs VERY CAREFULLY. I ordered this set. The label on the shrink wrap on the package said it was HD DVD. It was NOT. They were ALL standard definition DVDs. This is particularly important to new HD DVD viewers, since an HD DVD player WILL play standard definition discs as well as HD DVDs. So, a word of advice, make certain that you got what you paid for. I returned my set as defective."
3,It's a commercial,"So, a featurette? I thought it would have some little insights or something in to the making of the movies. Instead, it is just a compilation of the commercials. Meh."
2,false indications and features,"Amazon.com says that all movies have three languages. It is false!. Only have English and french languages. The number 1 (year one) has not both spanish language, neither spanish subtitles. Vey bad!!"
5,Great gift,This is really a neat gift. It shipped out quickly and the pseudo trunk like packaging made it really unique. The movies are great but the bookmarks are really outstanding and the other stuff in it made it truly special.
4,GREAT BUY,"EXCELLENT BUY, just be sure that you have a ""regualr"" HD DVD player. not many left in circulation. spend the extra and go blue ray.I'd buy from vendor again!!!!!"
1,Nothing new or interesting I haven't already seen.,Free but off no interesting value. Everything you have already seen in the movies. I'm not really sure why this is even called a Featurette.
2,THE PROBLEM IS NOT FIXED!!!,"The price of this 5-pack may in fact be ""too good to be true"". The 1st 4 discs are right - the last was the ""extras"" only DVD. The return policy for Amazon requires you to send it all back and then re-order. (I'm assuming for full refund because the product is technically ""defective"")However - you obviously take the chance that it will happen again. I couldn't understand why so many people who ordered the 5-pk also ordered ""The Order of the Pheonix"" seperately.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)Now I understand because I just did the same thing - with shipping it only costs $11.97 - still cheaper than I could find in the stores. Just very dissapointing - we've been watching them in anticipation of the ""Half Blood Prince"". Also very frustrating - I have grown to expect much better from Amazon."
5,Great on the second try,"The price on this was great. Unfortunately, the first set I received had two year ones and no year four in the set. However, the problem was solved quickly and a new set was sent, the old returned, and no harm done. Price was fantastic, and the customer service also exceeded my expectations. Would definitely shop Amazon again."
3,Missing a dvd,"It is a nicely packaged product with lots of little extras. However, even though the 5 dvd cases were different, The Goblet of Fire DVD's were in both the Goblet of Fire case AND the Chamber of Secrets case. So, we got 2 Goblet of Fire sets of DVD's and no Chamber of Secrets. I would return it but, our daughter liked it so much that she had everything out of the box and scattered, and since we already have Chamber of Secrets on DVD anyway, we just kept it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited when I received this as I had gotten a great deal on this set. However, the 2nd disc (Chamber of Secrets) did not work. It seems that only the music and background noise made it on the disc but not the actual voices. I am very disappointed as it must now be returned and the price is substantially more than I initially paid for it, not that I would purchase it again anyways due to the poor quality. Also, I appear to have received the Canadian version, so Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is now Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Very weird. Either way, I will probably resort to purchasing the individual movies and not the boxed set."
2,Not Extended Versions,"While searching for something to watch during dinner my wife and I came across Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the Disney East station. What caught our attention was there were scenes we knew were not in the theatrical release because we of course have the movies on dvd and along with our nephew and nieces have watched them several times. We also recently bought a blu-ray player and so we went searching for this extended version of the movie. What we found was this collection of 1-5 that promised ""Additional scenes"" for every movie. Don't be fooled. The ""Additional scenes"" is the same package of ""deleted scenes"" that comes with every Harry Potter movie. There were no additional scenes in the movies themselves. If you need or want the first 5 Harry Potter movies in blu-ray then this is a convenient way to get them. If you're looking for the extended versions of the movies, look elsewhere, they're not here."
5,"Great item, great service!","Knowing that HD DVD was about to become extinct, I was willing to pay little cash for this great set. I always wanted to watch HP movies, but never had the time, and never wanted to collect each movie individually.I sure am glad I bought it, I am almost done with the series (on the last year). I highly recommend this item to those who want to experience Hi-Def sound and visuals!"
5,Harry Potter Gift Set Bargain,The gift set came out in mid December 2007. The imitation leather box contains the 5 DVDs and several goodies including collectible cards and bookmark tokens. The DVDs include games children will enjoy.The best part was Amazon's price. You get all 5 movies for about $18 each. I held a Harry Potter marathon movie week and we watched a movie every night for a week. The continuity is better that way. It's also great to see the actors growing up across the years. Life is good.
2,Missing 5th movie,"I just sat down to watch the 5th movie in this set and unfortunately what was in the package wasn't the movie, but ""special features"". Which means either I have to exchange the set and try my luck again (looks like this is a common problem with this set) or I just fork over more money to get just the 5th movie. Very sloppy to be selling something like this."
3,A little rought until you get to years 4 &5,"I love the Harry Potter movies, so I really looked forward to getting them on Blu-ray. What I noticed immediately, was that years 1-3 really don't look particular sharp. Years 4 & 5, really do look amazing. The extras are set up a little odd, and really didn't do much for me.I hope Harry Potter year 6 & 7 continue to look even better than their predicesors..."
3,Modified Version of the Complete Movies,I love the Harry Potter series so I bought a set for me and my friend for her birthday. We were disappointed when we sat down to watch them that these are modified from the original version. You are not getting the entire movies. They are modified like they are on regular TV--just without the commercials (snippets cut out to cut down the time). They were a good deal and now I know why.
3,MIS-PACKAGED,"I recieved everything listed EXCEPT FOR THE FIFTH MOVIE. I recieved the ""special features"" for the fifth film instead (which does me litte to no good) but the other 4 movies were the widescreen films as listed. I dont like that this item is hit-or-miss but I still got 4/5 movies for 30 dollars so i guess the price was right. I don't like the false advertising though..."
1,Missing Disc 5,I received this set missing the Disc 5 movie (it came with the special features disc instead). I had it replaced only to have the same problem again. Very poorly distributed by the manufacturer. I would not recommend this set until they have figured out the problem.
2,Buy the stand-alone blu-ray disks...,"This set is bizarre and seems thrown together from an odds & ends bin of spare parts. Inside the exterior ""trunk"", the disks come in two different sizes of folding cases that do not at all resemble a product family. You're really stuck storing all of the disks in this case forever because none of the disks has sufficient labeling to be on the shelf by themselves.For uniformities sake, I'd much have preferred to buy the 5 blu-ray disks individually- especially knowing that another three movies will have to be purchased to complete this ""set"" in the future."
3,Not the right discs,"The DVDs that I did get were just fine. But, instead of getting a Disc 5 movie, I was sent the Disc 5 bonus material DVD. I have no idea whether mine was a fluke or whether all the boxed sets are faulty... mine was brand-new and shrink-wrapped so it wasn't tampered with. I called customer service though, and they were completely unhelpful. They would not replace the DVD or send me a new set, they only offered to reimburse me if I returned it."
3,Good Quality but one wrong disc,The set alone is really nice but the 5th movie was not included instead it was just the special features disc. They told me they were sold out and couldn't exchange it (even though it didn't say sold out on the products page as it usually does) but that they could refund me 20% of the cost (6.20). So I ended up buying the fifth movie from another amazon dealer for $10. Big hassle but I like the set itself.
2,Better check your set...,because I just received mine and it was missing Episode 5- Order of the Phoenix!!!!!!
3,Wait for all 7,"I agree with all the other reviews wait till all 7 come out, you know they will have a collectors set then. I purchased each movie when they came out then they released the extended versions. They have been on tv so many times and have more the my DVDs do. Gave it 3 stars just for the quality of the movies,I say wait even though I am a big Potter fan."
3,Sorcerer's Stone Doesn't play,"I was so excited to get this set on Hi Def. Well, the first film S.S. doesn't play at all. My player makes a clicking noise and won't read the disc. The rest work fine but I also noticed that C.O.S. looks like it isn't HD. The box's fastener was all bent up and didn't lock in that well. The velcro ""book belt"" was glued to the top dvd and couldn't be removed without tearing off the surface of the cover.I got a replacement because of the disc on (S.S.) not playing and once again it DOESN'T PLAY! I'm giving up asking for another 3rd replacement so i'll just buy the individual blu-ray disc. You'd think that a Limited Collectors Edition would have better quality assurance but whatever. Too many things are made out of the country and are poorly made and or have lead paint in them. I don't want to pay good money for junk or to get poisoned."
3,Could be better,the movies are great but the x-tra stuff is a wast and their are two more movies to the set. The first bonus discs is a game the next is all the extras to every movie (one disc and not in hi def) buy the single disc and save some money and it will look like a set when all the movies are done.
1,Disappointment,The product I received was damaged and I would like to swap it out for a new one or something to compensate for for the damage.Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift Set
3,Last 2 discs out of the set of 5 were corrupt,"I really like the movies and purchased the Years 1-5 disc set on sale - wonderful price ... however, by the time I got around to viewing all 5 years (it took me 4 months to finally find time to view them all), discs 4 and 5 are corrupt so guess I'll have to purchase these separately. 1 - 3 were terrific, much better video quality than standard DVD and what I downloaded from ITunes. Will wait for 4 and 5 to come on sale again before purchasing the BluRay version. Due to the wonderful sale price for the 5 year set, the savings may still come out equal to purchasing each year separately."
4,Good hold-over,"Year 1 doesn't actually look that great for a blu-ray video but 2-5 are quite good. I say this is a good hold-over since the super ultimate special editions are being released starting next month, which one should probably pick up if they're going for the best picture and sound quality. Hopefully they will have improved the over-all visual aspect of year 1."
4,Harry,Harry box set was a good buy. If you like harry I would look at this to see what is all in it.
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"After seeing that they had the series out in stores, I decided to look on Amazon to find a deal... and I did. Not only was it cheaper here, but it came brand new, in the shrink wrap, and in the time specified... I couldn't be more please with the service and quality of the product. It is EXACTLY what I was expecting and hoping for."
3,Sweet Deal,Great value! The only issue was the movie entitled Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not the movie but a disc of special features.This was a little upsetting but since none of the movies contained any special features we all enjoyed watching it.
5,huge bang for my buck,"i know HD DVD ""lost"" the HD ""battle"" but this is still awesome. For what I paid, there is A LOT in this box. A must have for any Potter fan with an HD DVD player."
3,"Ordered blu ray, only received DVD","It was advertised as blu ray, but when the product was received it was not blu ray. We e-mailed the seller about the issue and were told that blu ray was not available, however the seller agreed to refund our money. Since the seller could not provide a blu ray product and it was a gift, we just decided to keep the DVD version."
1,5th Disk Missing,"I've had the same problem as the last few people. I had the ""special features"" disk 5 instead of the movie itself. Upon calling Amazon and speaking to someone on the phone, they are conveniently ""out"" of the boxed sets for an exchange. But when I go back in as a new customer on the website, I'm able to buy the set again and they have it in stock. I think they know what's up and just don't want to send out another faulty set to someone who already complained, but for a new customer, they don't mind sending them the faulty boxed set.Anyway, they offered me a full refund if I ship the product back or a 20% credit ($7) to my account and I keep the set. I took the latter option and wanted to let everyone know they are offering the $7 credit."
5,All 5 movies plus early arrival!,"My 8 year old couldn't have been happier! He's been saving his money for this set. After reading the reviews about the missing 5th disc I prepared him for the fact that he may have to return the package if the Order of the Phoenix is a special feature disc instead. As soon as it arrived (a day earlier than we had been expecting), he opened it and immediately checked the 5th disc. It was exactly what he'd been hoping for, plus you can't beat the price for all 5 movies. Thanks Amazon...one happy 8 year old and a happy mom!"
4,Pleasantly surprised but a few flaws,"I was expecting all the ""extras"" that came with this to be low quality - but was pleasantly surprised. The 5 bookmarks that came with it are made of metal and actually look very nice. The trunk is sturdy cardboard with metal hinges - but it looks nice and I am using it to hold some of my knick-knacks. It also comes with some trading cards in the envelope that Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter was in.The ""3 Hours of Special Content"" was unimpressive. There wasn't really any new or interesting content. It is just a bunch of TV specials that review what happened in the movies.If you want the 2-disc special editions of all five movies this is a great purchase... and cheaper than buying them all separately. But if you already own the first four movies there is obviously no point in buying this."
1,rip-off,"Why would I look to ""thousands of free movies"" for an ad?Doesn't Bezos have enough money yet?Why dupe us with false hope?"
3,Don't fall for the free shipping--you'll wait over 2 weeks,"I ordered my set on 8/28, and apparently won't see it until 9/11--over two weeks in transit because I chose the free shipping. As far as I'm concerned, that's really outrageous. I'd rather pay the extra (which, I guess, is their ploy). Wish I would have known."
2,#5 Movie Not There,"This product would have been great, we bought it new. However, when we got to the fifth movie, it was a DVD about the movie, not the actual movie. It was the special effects and so on. No movie. Pretty disappointing. If it had been there, the price and value would have been worth it."
1,Missing Disk,"I was disappointed with this purchase, and I had to return it. The 5th disk (Order of the Phoenix) was missing, a ""special features"" disk was in its place and the feature film was missing. Unfortunately Amazon was out of stock and I wasn't even able to get the set replaced."
2,Yet another missing disc,"I had the same thing happen. I bought this for my son, promising him he could watch each movie after he read each book. Well, he finished book five, but no movie, just the special features disc. Very annoying."
1,for kids,"I got it for free as a 'prime member'. I do not think I'll watch it, it is for kids 8 - 15 years old, I guess and I am about six times older than that. Maybe when I get really senile."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"I am not able to view the DVD Selections.My player will not recognise HD. But the worst part is,in trying to correct my mistake, I have receivedno responses for my queries into correctionof the problem....."
1,HD Harry,Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift Set [HD DVD]Haven't bought it and Now I Won'tWarners has shafted Toshiba and Gone BLU RAY Only.So there wont be any more Harry Potter Films on HD DVDWarner Bros Suck
2,not good,"i try watching this movie online, but is did not look good, all blurry, that sucked, i was expecting something better, but it was for free. SO!!!!!"
1,Why haven't they sold extended versions yet?,"I think i speak for most harry potter fans that the extended versions of the movies that they show on tv are better. Personally, I own all the other movies and have them in two-disc editions and they don't even put deleted scenes on the second disc, except on the third one. Are they just going to keep repackaging each sequel as a box set with hours of HBO specials without ever selling the extended versions of the movies? Warner Bros. should take a page out of New Line Cinemas Home Entertainment and sell a boxed set with two-disc versions of the extended movies as was done with LOTR. That in my opinion would be a good marketing ploy!"
3,"Great, but...",I got this set as a christmas preesnt from my dad and when I opened it I was extermely excited. I have a ps3 and were recently having a Potter movie marathon.. When we go to the fourth movie it wouldn't play after trying only to realize 15 minutes later that it was an HD DVD.I loved everything else about this set but was EXTREMELY disapointed about the fourth movie as its one of my favorites.
4,Visually Stunning,"I really love how the Harry Potter Movies look on Blu-Ray. It is also nice to have the extras. This is a wonderful collection, well worth the price."
4,Harry Potter Years 1-5,I like the DVD set. However the last DVD -Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix did not have the movie just special effects options. I did contact Amazon and did get the movie to me within a few days. Your customer service is excellent.
4,Excellent value on Harry Potter HD DVDS,This is an excellent way to convert your Harry Potter collection to HD DVD. I had been looking at upgrading but the cost to buy each single HD DVD would have been $30 each. The additional discs and features also make it a perfect gift for a Harry Potter fan.
5,Awesome,"This was a Christmas gift for an avid Harry Potter Fan and the quality of the product, the design, and the picture quality is great! Great investment and a great gift!"
3,It's only a movie trailer,I clicked on this just to see what it was. I guess for a teaser view of the Harry Potter series this is OK. It didn't inspire me enough to pay for viewing the full length movies though. I'd rather just reread the books for the 3rd or 4th time.
3,Just a promo for film six...,...but what was there recalled the beauty and excitement of the 1st five films. Worth the money spent and time to view it.
5,"Awesome, of course!","These are great, of course. I had already seen them all, but it was time to own my own set of all the films. Great buy, awesome movies! (The books are even better!)"
5,Excellent,Movie's were in mint condition. Looked like it had never been touched before. Bought it as a birthday present for mother-in-law and she loves them.
5,Amazing,Five amazing movies for one amazing price....about half the price of buying each movie individually.
4,Not Happy,"All in all the box set was a good buy. The only thing I don't like is the fact the first two movies came in completely different sized cases to the other three, even though the suitcase has enough room to accomodate the bigger size cases. That and the recent announcment of Warner Bros. going Blu-Ray exclusive means I won't be getting the final two movies on HD-DVD. Not happy WB."
5,What a beautiful packaging !,The packaging of this special edition is just beautiful. The HD DVD cases are of different size and shape because they were meant to look like books. I really adore this packaging because it breaks with the monotony of the regular HD DVD cases. This cute little trunk makes me think of a kid's secret box of treasures!
2,Harry Potter 1-5 Boxed Set,"These DVDs played beautifully. No problem with picture of sound, etc. One really big problem though. It was supposed to be a brand new, never viewed boxed set of the first five Harry Potter movies. The third year DVD, even though it said Harry Potter all of over the outside cover and top of the DVD, it was the Polar Express movie with Tom Hanks. I am not happy with that at all!"
5,Great fun ...,"Others have done a much better job than I could ever do at reviewing this set, so I will keep it simple. I have an XBox360 with HD-DVD add-on, attached to an Onkyo HD receiver and a Samsung 56"" DLP HDTV, and these DVD's worked wonderfully on my gear. Similar to others, I was disappointed that the first two DVD's were in different packaging, but I mostly care about the actual videos and we enjoyed watching them very much. Now, if I could only hope to get the final two on HD-DVD ... ah well, I guess I will catch them via Blockbuster download or something like that ... cheers to all!"
5,"Harry Potter Years 1-5, Full screen","Product was received before promised date, and looks to be in good order. The outer packaging arrived damaged, but only slightly, and the discs are still wrapped so I am looking forward to the flics when my people get here."
3,Contents not right,Year 5 was not the movie. Instead it was Special Features. We sent it back and ordered another one and it was the same thing. Amazon ended up giving us $10 refund.
2,No 5th Movie!,"I ordered this set because my children had lost the 2nd movie and the 4th one decided it no longer wanted to play in our main DVD player. Disc 1 was so scratched up, it looked like someone had let their cat use it as a claw-sharpener, and the 5th disc was only bonus features. Amazon apologized & replaced it promptly, but the 2nd set I received also had a 5th disc that was only bonus features. After realizing this was a common complaint, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to which the WB manufacturer (address on box) has not yet responded. False advertising, unprofessional? You be the judge. I just found out this set of discs is no longer being made. Hmm, I wonder why?!?"
2,"Mispackaged. Buy in person to ID the problem, not online","Everything looked great at first, but then I realized that there are 2 copies of the 2nd movie and no copies of the third. I would highly recommend potential buyers go to a local store and inspect the package before purchasing this DVD set. DO NOT BUY ONLINE OR FROM AMAZON. Unfortunate because they are such great films and packaged for the holidays. If anybody wants to trade a disk 3 for a disk 2, look me up."
5,Downing for no good reason,Almost everybody is giving this product low reviews because they say the studio is ripping them off because when 6 and 7 come they will release another box set.This is more then likely true but don't knock this product for that reasonCOME ON PEOPLE.Judge this product on it's merits and not on the conduct of the studio.
2,misleading,Seems misleading.....I was hoping for the possibility of seeing the series. I don't like snippets of movies. Why would I want to watch an advertisement for buying the cd set?
3,What was the point?,"It's just like a trailer that sums up the first five years of the series. I don't know why I expected more, but I was disappointed."
5,Harry Potter gift set,"We were interested in obtainig the Harry Potter DVD's. The gift set was less expensive than buying the 5 DVD's individually. Have enjoyed watching 2 of the DVD's. The metal bookmarks, trading cards, interactive game, and bonus DVD were an added bonus,and no added cost."
5,Magic in a trunk....,"This little trunk is just amazingly wonderful. For a child or adult who has a true childhood love for the films will appreciate this set. Teh disks are paxkaged as if in your own hogwarts trunk ready to hurry of to London and hope on the Hogwarts Express. The earlier moves were not able to be quite as crisp as you would hope for on Blu-Ray, but I was sure it was limitation in the filming quality that prevented this, however the last movie is amazing stunning, a dark move over all but things really do pop with the Blu-ray quality. I have heard some complain about the packaging, but I love the charm of it. It also came with some cards and some very nice book mark. This would be an outstanding gift for any Potter fan."
5,Wow we love this,"My 10 year old son is a huge Harry Potter Fan. He loves everything in the gift set! I was pleased because I paid far less for this via Amazon versus my local Best Buy and Target stores, and that includes what I paid in shipping!"
1,did not work,"I got this gift set for my wife as a birthday gift. She was very excited to open it. When she did, none of the discs would play. We tried on a Blueray player, HD dvd player, and even a regular dvd player. She was very upset."
1,Beware,"Sorcerer's Stone played ok. Half way through Chamber of Secrets movie started pixelating and then froze. I thought it was my player,but I ran a known good blu ray and it wasn't the player. Prisoner,Goblet and Phoenix acted as though they were a blank disc because my player sounded like it was off to the races. So beware buying this set."
3,It's okay,"The first two movies seem to be lacking in quality compared to the others. I expect blu Ray quality from all of them, but it's apparent that they weren't filmed in it. Alas, it is a set though. The covers are the thin type, and it sticks out compared to the rest of the Harry potter blu rays I have. Minor inconvenience. If you want the blu rays cheap, get it.... If you are a true collector, you'll prolly get a different set anyways. All in all, exactly what I expected. A cheap stripped down set ."
1,unable to use on all my dvd players and amazon won't take back,"I purchased Harry Potter Limited Edition Dvd set for my Grandsons birthday. It won't play on any of our dvd players or his due to the fact it's HD DVD. Amazon refuses to take it back because I am disputing the fact that they double billed me for the item. They billed me on my current email address and then again on a very old one for the same item. Now I'm stuck with a useless item that I was billed twice from.Amazon had very poor billing practices, poor customer service. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing anything for them. Looking at other reviews they seem to double bill people on a regular basis"
5,This stupid book,This book was amazing. Full of action and adventure if you injoy reading this is good for you to. I love it
3,Double Disk,"Well I would have given this 4 stars had the package not included two disc 2's. Needless to say I wasn't too please with that as it was a Christmas present for someone else and they had already begun to watch them. The discs themselves were shipped in a timely manner and arrived unharmed. There are no extras on these disks... no commentary, outtakes or any other of the usual extras, just the movie."
1,What was the point of this,"What was the point of this, it was a waste of time. We love harry potter but this 30 second commercial is pointless."
3,Scratches on the movie causes movie to freeze,"Four of the five dics play fine, but the fifth movie will only play half way though before freezing and stops competely"
5,Harry Potter Gift Set blu-ray,"Very cool set, loved the extras that came with the disks. Design of exterior and interior packaging makes it very special."
1,DVD's NEVER PLAYED ON ANYTHING WE OWN,"This looked like a great set when it first came out and I bought it for Christmas as a family gift.But the DVD's would not play on anything and we had a brand new High Def TV and DVD player. I also tried it on all lap tops, portable DVD players and two new and large iMacs.Why I neglected to send it back I have no idea. I just pulled it out and tried it again. No luck.Another idiot purchase."
5,Harry Potter Years 1-5 (Widescreen Edition),I love it. I love all the Harry Potter. They got here in the time frame that was given. I love Amazon.
2,1-7 special ed????,After getting burned by the book boxed set I am kinda wary about buying this boxed set...It looks really nice and like it has a very nice case and all but so did the books until we actually got them and the description changed once they shipped...so I will just wait till all 7 come on in a boxed set like we know they will and get ripped off just the once and have only 2 copys of the DVD's and not 3.
5,Fun way to get the 1st 5 movies on Blu-ray,"This was such a fun find. I was able to get the first 5 Harry Potter movies for under $40 (<$9 each) on blu-ray. Plus the bookmarks are awesome. Just a fun thing to have. The only dislike I had about the set was the ""book-like"" cases of the first to movies are CD size while the next 3 are blu-ray/dvd size. I wish they would have all been the same size but I don't always expect everything I wish for. You can see this in the picture. This set is a joy to have, fun, creative and like I said a good value for when I bought it."
1,"Do not buy it, bad quality product","Do not buy it. I bought this product in may 2 2008, collectable. I rarely use it, and when it used I'm extremely careful. The dvd surface is clean and perfect but the movies don't work. It's not worth it."
3,accidental click,"I accidentally clicked the link for movies but it was not.So, I didn't look through it.If you are a big fan of Harry Potter, then watch it."
3,Harry Potter,"It could have had more time, would of liked that better. How about the whole thing in like 20 min"
1,Video wont play - Amazon Prime has ISSUES,"This won't play. The video starts then stops just after the into scene. I stream Hulu Plus and YouTube with NO problems...Amazon Prime...well - thus far the only Instant Video I was able to successfully stream on my computer was an episode of ""Gilligans Island"". Is that the BEST you can do Amazon??? Why should I BUY or RENT one of their movies. If it won't play, what sort of hassle will I go through to get a refund. NO THANKS. Think I'll stick to Hulu Plus and YouTube. Currently enjoying PBS ""Daniel Daronda"" on YouTube. Works like a charm, no loading issues. Amazon Prime regularly sticks and says ""seeking""...HOW RIDICULOUS!!! Don't bother subscribing to Amazon Prime. It's a JOKE. Oh and that ONE WHOLE BOOK you get to borrow for free ONCE PER MONTH. LMAO...really Amazon???!!! How GENEROUS...!"
3,Harry potter,It was exactly what i thought it would be. clips of the movies nothing special .And no clues on what was comming next. so there was no build up.
5,Great Deal !,"For the price you can't beat getting 5 movies. It comes in a small box, with slide out snap-ins for each DVD (complete with the original cover art fold, for each movie. Its about the size of any other box set movies. If you don't mind not having each and every single case for each movie, then just buy the box set. Alot cheaper than buying them all individually."
1,NO 5TH DISC AT ALL!!!!!!!,"Even though I read previous reviews stating that the 5th disc in the ""Order of the Phoenix"" case was the special features disc instead of the movie, I went ahead and ordered because I thought the problem would have been fixed by now. MY MISTAKE! When I unwrapped the package and opened the ""Order of the Phoenix"" case, there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING there. Not even the special features disc. I of course called Amazon, and they are expecting me to mail the entire set back instead of them just sending me the last movie. Even though they are sending me a free mailing label, I'm still going to have to trot down to the post office and wait in line which is an inconvenience. Amazon should just be sending me a separate movie. Of course I'm going to wait until I get the new set before I go anywhere to ensure that it is complete. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,Update 4/2/2012,"This is an update to my original review. After purchasing a new DVD player, found that the HD DVD version of this set STILL will not play. Had to return the set and was then only given partial credit as per the return policy even though everything was returned in excellent condition. Buyer beware: order the correct version of this set!"
4,"loved the movies, but...",...the dvds don't carry all scenes we've seen on tv before (and expected to find them here!). otherwise: great!
4,A Wonderful Set,The Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Ed. Gift Set does indeed make a wonderful gift. I love the whimsical packaging. Amazon made this availabe at a lower price. I'm so happy I bought it from Amazon.com. I saved a lot of money.
5,Great option for a tittle in blu-ray,"I was very pleased to be able to find this product in amazon. It is an exelent option for people who still don't have access to the great experience in blu-ray, the movies are fantastic to watch in high-definition!"
3,Dissapointed,"This review is about the packaging. Obviously the movies are good or I would not have purchased the set. Someone thought it would be a cute idea to put the movies in a ""trunk"" but unfortunately the velcro strap breaks upon opening and the so called new disk of extra features aren't even in HD. The trunk doesn't sit on the shelf properly because of its odd shape. If you have not purchased the films, then buy them separately in Blu-ray and skip the overpriced packaging."
4,"Good product, bad layout","This was a great product overall, very nice collection of all Harry Potter movies. Couple of minor gripes :(1) The layout was not very good, even though the additional items were thoughtful and cute. It could have been more compact.(2) The resolution could have been better."
5,Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift Set,Great Gift Set but if you are in France you will be charged 19 of airport tax.
4,Harry Potter DVDs,"Excellent price for this full set of Harry Potter DVDs. However, gift box was not made as well as it seems in photos, just cardboard. Made an excellent Christmas gift and the additional bonus DVDs were great. Did not know there was an interactive Harry Potter DVD game. Still haven't played it yet but seems like it will be lot of fun for the whole family."
2,5th Disc No Show,"I ordered this set for my 7 yr old and we've been on a Harry Potter rampage to get all 5 discs in so we can watch the 6th in the theater. The fam and I got thru 1-4 in the last couple weeks and just sat down to watch 5 so that we can go to the 6th this wknd. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed that the 5th disc is a Special Features disc. Good thing my son is understanding - he seems to be more understanding than I because he's bouncing around the living room and I'm absolutely livid. I will not order from Amazon again, this coming from an Amazon Prime customer, unless this is resolved."
3,Great Goldbox... But worth replacing your DVD's?,"QUALITY:All/Most of the movies are great quality, really what you would expect from a blu-ray, although some of the movies (First 3) didn't give you the same kind of 'WOW' that the other blu-ray disks do, they just don't look as good as Iron Man for example. Regular DVD's (the first 3 at least that I can recall) on my PS3 which up-scales them looked almost, if not as good (pretty much, unless I'm old and going blind ... at 27).SPECIAL FEATURES/ETC:Right now there's nothing that stands out on these disks as a great feature to mention.CONCLUSION:If you already own some of the disks and want to buy the blu-ray to replace those, it may not be the best use of your money over buying simply the ones you're missing. However knowing that there are movies left to come, it may be best to wait for either the next box set, or further through the series. (not to say that if you get it for a good price, not to buy it ;))"
3,not exactly as expected,I had expected to receive the Harry Potter discs to have all of the options on them. These are for the movie only and do not include any special features. Apparently you need two discs in order to obtain all the extra features. It was disappointing that this was not clear. I now have the movies but none of the special effects or games that go along with them. To get the rest of the options I would have to repurchase the movies.
1,Unacceptable,"The first set I received had scratched and missing discs. Amazon's replaced it, but the second set I received had, not the disc for Order of the Phoenix but its special features disc."
2,Loved the Movies/ This set defective,I guess I'm a little surprised that so many people actually kept this set since they noted the first two discs were not of blu ray quality. This set explicitly states that the Blu-ray discs are 1080p high definition. The first two are not. My old Harry Potter DVDs looked to be at a higher resolution when played on my blu ray player than these supposed 1080p (I am referring to the first two discs). I guess I like to get what is stated on the package. I returned mine. I will wait until a new set is released in hopes they actually release ALL the discs in 1080p.
1,Also missing disc 5,"I also ordered this product before these reviews were written. I am attempting to return and get a replacement, but based on the other comments, I am not holding out much hope."
4,"Great films finally in HD, very odd packaging","When Harry Potter was finally announced in both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray I did a silent yelp for joy. The package arrived today and so far the films all look gorgeous. My only quibble, which kept this from 5 stars is the really odd packaging. The value of the set is there, around $20 a film, but it is such an odd shape I'm not sure where to store it. Inside of the trunk are the films, the DVD's resemble books and are different sizes, again quite odd. Visually the set is appealing, but in all practicality it would be better off as regular discs. Shave $20 off the price and package it like the superb Die Hard set and we would have a winner."
3,dics freezing,"I love these movies and although it may be true the first two years aren't as 'blu'ray-y' as I would've hoped I can get past it. They still look better than the regular dvd. The biggest problem I have is that they tend to freeze in certain sections and I have to fast forward and miss bits to get it to work again. I have the same problem with all five discs, straight out of the package. I have a new Sony Blu Ray player that works like a charm on every other disc so I know it's not the player that's the problem. I'm really disappointed."
4,Cool Poster,"I had a 22X28 picture frame that I needed a poster for and I chose this one. The quality is good, however it does have this two-inch white border surrounding it that contains the artist and title at the bottom. I didn't realize it would have that and I would prefer if it didn't. But aside from that, I'm happy with my purchase."
1,"Virtually unreadable, except as an example of 1930's magazine fiction","The stories in Murder by the Dozen were published in Collier's in the 1930's and were unusual because they featured a suave, debonair Chinese detective...or something. It's not clear exactly what the hero, James Lee Wong, did for a living, but he was a Federal employee, possibly of the Treasury Department, and a graduate of Yale. Because the stories are short, there is virtually no character or plot development, and they tend to plod along fairly pointlessly and then wrap up in a quick paragraph. Decent subway reading -- if you have a 20-30 minute commute you can read a story per ride -- but that's about it. Also, after buying the book, which appears to be a ""print on demand"" title, I discovered it is availble for free on the web, at the site listed on the book cover."
1,Really disappointing,"Gotta agree with the other guy Tarre. There was really not enough surfing. The angles were all the same, pretty drab shots. The bulk of the movie is watching skuzzy looking dudes deal with being completely unprepared for what being dropped on a desolate tropical island requires. I fell asleep toward the end of it and really didn't have a desire to go back and finish it."
2,Not what I was expecting,"After reading the reviwes I red here, I was expecting something different, not enough surf and alot of ""survivor"" like images.....Buy the other titles amazon carries. Like the Jack Johnson`s"
5,Blues Giutarist,"Good old blues from Eddie Boyd, I can't get enough of all this blues, Good easy going blues another interesting cd"
3,Just Another Common Side Scroller Game,"This game really isnt anything special. Splinter Cell Pandora Tommorow is almost the exact same thing. But I will admit, The 3D Hub is pretty cool (The Part of The game that isnt a sidescroller). Just Because it is a not original it is still fun to play, But expect to cruise through it in about 6 hours."
2,"Meh, buy it used","Pretty boring side scroller with repetative tasks. Don't waste your cash, but it used. Not a bad game if you stuck in an airport."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"Nothing like the description. If you want to waste your money, swamp land would be a better investment."
3,Comfortable and good price,I did not like the gray color on the back heel but the had a nice fit. Good price.
1,Buyer Beware: This is White Nationalist Propaganda,"I expected to gain some objective insight into how people on the border are living with illegal immigration. But it didn't take long to understand that this film is white nationalist propaganda. Don't waste your time, unless you're a neo-nazi."
5,Abstract Algebra,"This is a very easy to follow introduction into abstract algebra. the writing starts with specific examples and follows to show how to construct generalized theorems with proofs. it's also light-weight, and easy to bring around with my binder. I will be keeping this book well after the class is over. the book came with minimal damage, mainly to the cover."
2,Used copy falling apart,"I ordered a copy of this book used, which I returned. The book was falling apart, so I returned it. However, based on what I saw of my other classmates' books, it seems this book's binding was not well made. The new edition is overpriced, especially since it is prone to falling apart. Save yourself the money and order a used copy of Gallian's Contemporary Abstract Algebra instead."
2,"clean well, but stinky","These wipes seem to do their job just fine, but they smell bad. I can't stand to use them for diaper changes so my husband uses them. He doesn't seem to mind the odor as much as I do."
3,Not whats in the picture...,Well the book they sent me isn't as handsome as the one in the picture. The copy I got is also printed by the NRA which to me is a little suspect but so far it seems worth the 8 dollars. I'm sure I will be buying another copy on down the line not only to see if there are differences but because the man made leather is already taking a beating from being toted around on my daily excursions.
3,Good crock pot but it does have some down falls.,"I have had this crock pot for almost a year now so I have a pretty good idea how well made this product is. The crock pot size is very nice for a family of 4-5 people, and the clean up is fairly easy and I do like the keep ""warm feature, however the crock pot does run high even if it's on the low setting, and my lid has already cracked, not the glass part, but the cheap plastic handle. So now I'm looking for a replacement lid. Other than that the crock pot is OK."
2,This Crock Pot is way too hot,"This Crock Pot cooks way too fast on all the 4 settings. The lowest setting says ""10 hours"" and the roast that I put in usually takes about 3, which defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. Next time I will be more carful and read reviews. This one is not my favorite. I have started using my old one that is about 10 years old and rusty on the outside. At least it cooks better."
2,Very fast slow cooker,We've owned this for over a year. It has high and low settings but has always seemed to run on high no matter how it's set. The appliance is attractive and we've made some great meals in it but it definitely can't be set to low and left on while we're away for the workday. After a batch of spaghetti sauce burned to the sides today I came online to check other reviews and see if maybe this one is defective or has broken. Interesting to see other reviewers also saying theirs is too hot. We may keep this to cook in when we're there to stir frequently but we'll be looking for a true slow cooker too. If you buy one of these be careful and test it when you are on hand to stop the process if it runs too hot!
1,DOES NOT FIT B5 Passat,"This filter does not fit the newer style (B5) Passats, I beleive this is for the older model ending mid 2001."
4,Adventure,"This was a good story, but I found it hard to read because of the language used. The broken language made it hard for me to comprehend, but it did go along with the story."
2,Adventure by Jack London,"The book sounded good and started off well, but really dragged on. Jack wrote some great stuff, but this was not it. Really one that should have stayed on the shelf. Enough said."
4,great!,tHIS BOOK WAS A LITTLE HEAVY IN THE BEGINNING BUT TURN OUT TO BE A FINE BOOK. wRITTEN IN 1911 BUT HOLDS THE STANDARD OF TODAY
2,Dissapointed but was able to fix.,"When this blanket arrive it had a terrible causticodor, was extremely stiff and I was ready to return it.However I decided to wash it in Woolite and let it air out.It is now a great blanket with a wonderful softness, lightweight,warm and no odor. They should do this before they sell it."
3,Navy Blue 70% Virgin Wool Winter Blanket,"I was overwhelmed by the chemical smell (fire retardent) and it was very stiff.I had read a review on this blanket before I purchased it and the customer mentioned the chemicalsmell and said she washed and dried it.So, that's what I did even though it said 'dry clean only'.It took away some of the smell and made it a little softer so I'm going to wash and dry it again.I think that will work! I think it's a good deal for the price and quality. (I bought two of them)"
5,Truckin really delivers,"This recording will get you moving. From Bertha through the US Blues this concert rocked. It is a pleasure to hear Jerry Garcia and Bob Wier taking turns singing some of the bands timeless classics. On a scale of one to ten, I would have to give this recording an eleven. But I may be a little biased, I was there. Peace."
4,Disc 2 is the best,"While Disc One had its moments songs like Touch of Grey and Man Smart, Woman Smarter are really bad. I bought this cd because I wanted a live recording of Touch of Grey. The version on this cd sounds like he is just reading the words and the band isnt really noticable. Man Smart, Woman Smarter is probably the worst song the Dead has ever recorded. The second disc is where the Dead regain form and play out there hearts. Id highly recommend this cd for a Dead Head."
5,Awesome and enlightening,"This show is taken from the Dead's last great run. Everything came together after the resurrection of Jerry and everything comes together in this show. The mix and mastering are great. It seems like every instrument and voice are at the right level and the effect is pleasing. Personally, I do not like Brent's ""I will take you home"" (maybe it's too gentle for me to handle), but these CDs are filled with so many great renditions of Dead songs that I'll take it!"
1,This is NOT Elvis,I am sorry but this is going BACK! It sounds no more like Elvis than the ones at a Karaoke Bar. Very disappointed.J
4,Tough And Amazing Book,"This is an amazing book. It writes with shocking reality and naked insight into the mind of a teenager. Like a tough, non-poetic Francesca Lia Block or Rob Thomas."
1,Lynch wastes a good character on a lousy plot,"Mick, star of the blue-eyed son series, could have been a hero to be talked about for years to come in YA literature. but Lynch's meandering narrative, gratutious violence, and left-dangling plot lines leave the books' potential unrealized. it has been said this would have made one good book, so it is easy to suspect Lynch of trying to milk the library market for three sales instead of one."
3,combine queueing theory and network,"Contests as follows CH2 : Markovian model 2.1 markovian loss system 2.2 markovian delay system 2.3 extended markovian model CH3: non Markovian model 3.1 renewal process 3.2 poisson input general service time model 3.3 poisson input constant service time model 3.4 renewal input exponential server model 3.5 renewal input single server models CH4 : Multi-class input models 4.1 batch arrival model 4.2 priority model 4.3 multi dimensional traffic model 4.4 mixed loss and delay system 4.5 muli queue models CH5 : alternative routing systems CH6. advanced teletraffic modelsas you can see above contents, this book focuses on combining queueing theeory and network analysisbut I can't recommend this book for student who first face at queueing theory because, hard to read. and there are some errata (wrong spelling or wrong equation) and and they make me confusing."
4,Great for anyone -- not just diabetics!,This new book has many great shopping and meal planning tips as well as wonderful recipes from meats to sweets.
5,Excellent on Every Level,"This is a great cookbook.Easy to read and easir to eat! You don't have to be broke or have diabetes to enjoy this food so the recipes are good for the whole family. I not only own it,I frequently give it to other people and so far they have been as happy with it as I am."
3,Not consistent with rest of series,"I'll have to agree Nicodeme. I have really enjoyed this series up until now, but this book fell flat. I felt that Carey wanted this to be a really emotional point in the storyline, but I just wasn't feeling it. The stories were not as engaging and the dialogue was dull. I've had so much fun with this series until now that I'll probably give the next book a try, just in case this one was a fluke."
2,Desapointment,"Being a fan of the serie, I have been desapointed by the lack of ambition of this book. The 2 short stories are pretext for exposing nudidity and are in fact weakening the character of Lucifer. I guess this is the end of this serie for me. Hope to find a replacement."
2,A disappointing effort,"I've loved every book Dan Simmons has written--until now. While ""Hardcase"" is a fairly enjoyable thriller, it's yawningly predictable and simply not a worthy effort for a writer of Simmons' talents. But it's surely a matter of expectations--go into this one expecting a standard P.I. vs. the Mafia story, and you'll probably enjoy it. But if you're looking for something that measures up to his previous work, this ain't it."
1,Yikes,"I'm a huge fan of both Westlake and Stark so of course I grabbed up this book when I saw the taglines and reviews. Unfortunetly, this comes across as well written as a Mack Bolan (The Executioner) novel disguised as a mystery. VERY(!!) simple and cliched - I won't be checking out this writer's other novels."
1,I'd rather go to the dentist...,"Owner and lover of every book Dan Simmons has ever published except this one...What a disappointment. It's a shame because the book is based in Buffalo (my original hometown). Kurtz is completely unlikable, character development is practically non-existant, the plot is shallow and the ending completely predictable. Absolute waste of time...."
1,I don't get it,"Everyone here really seems to like this book. As a matter of fact, I read it because of a recommendation here.I have to admit, I'm a sucker for the hard-boiled school, as this book certainly is. However, I thought the book was complete waste of time. Every character, including the hero, is extremely one-dimensional, and the book was very formulaic. Maybe his other stuff is good, but don't bother with this one."
3,Hard boiled egg salad,"There isn't much Dan Simmons hasn't done. He's written full blown horror novels, sci-fi sagas, short stories, mainstream thrillers and a few books that fall between the cracks. He effectively hops from genre to genre, expanding their limitations or, as he does in Hardcase, works well within their boundaries. He doesn't want to enlighten or impress us with his prose - he wants to grab us by the collar, put a knee to our groin and kick us down a flight of stairs. Hardcase is just Dan Simmons doodling between larger projects. As a matter of fact I'd be surprised if it took Simmons as much time to write this areodynamic novel as it takes to read it. Try to imagine a master chef at a 5 star restaurant making an egg salad sandwich on his day off. Hardcase is Dan Simmons egg salad recipe."
1,"Graphic violence, not suspense","Extremely violent and graphic and just really unpleasant. Was looking for a mystery/suspense, but this just wasn't my type of novel; more for Tom Clancy fans."
3,"Not Dan Simmons best, but...","This is still an enjoyable story. Just because we are used to brilliance from Mr Simmons, doesn't mean he can produce it every time. The hero is a flawed ex con who has very rough edges. It is not a very deep novel but I enjoyed it for what is was. Just a fun pulp fiction type of yarn."
4,The Mean Streets,"When Joe Kurtz hits the streets all better beware. After eleven years in prison he is ready. One set of clothes a few dollars and a old female friend that helps him get started again. Not being able to obtain a PO license he is limited in what he can do. From a son of a Don in prison he is able to hook up with the don and obtain work looking or his missing accountant. the story flows from there with a lot of twists and turns, in the last pages you will find some real surprises. I strongly reccommend this novel, you can't miss."
2,Hardcase,"An open letter to Mr. Dan Simmons.Dear Mr. Simmons: Please stick to horror novels and leave the PI stories to writers who understand the genre. Your novel Summer of Night is one of my favorites. But Hardcase has more holes than a 20 year old bucket. Why would anybody give an ex-con like Kurtz the time of day, much less quit their old job, give him a millon dollars etc.... And do not forget that in the first of the book Kurtz was looking for a missing accountant. After the accountant's wife is killed you never hear about him anymore."
1,A disappointment.,"Really hate to give a bad review to one of my favourite authors, but this book is poor. One can only hope that this slim offering was an indifferent attempt to meet publishing deadlines."
2,Whatever happened to Dan Simmons?,"Ask me a year ago and I would have put Dan Simmons up there with Stephen King and Orson Scott Card, not just in terms of quality, but in terms of his ability to write successfully in every genre. His thriller ""The Crook Factory"" was as good as it gets.Then came two clunkers in a row, ""Darwins Blade"" and now ""Hardcase."" Both suffer from the same shallow chaterierisation and lackluster plots. Hardcase's tale of an ex-cop/con working for a crimeboss lacked both the color and complexity we've come to expect from Simmons. Regrettably, Mr. Simmons seems to be writing in the hopes of selling to Hollywood. The book reads like a lame star-driven action piece.Come back Mr. Simmons. You're the best when you let yourself be."
1,Note on Noontide Press,"As I note in another review, the intro to this edition is explicitly white supremacist. It's not a mistake that happened to slip by the (otherwise decent) folks at Noontide Press. The Press publishes exclusively whack-job conspiracy theories about how Jews/Blacks/the Illuminati/Elders of Zion/UN fetishists/Masonic wizards,etc. are secretly running the world that oppressed Nazis/Klansman/Christian Identitarians/etc. need to take back. Buying this edition puts money in these folks' pockets, so be advised."
4,"Not quite as vibrant as the picture, but it will work, I guess.","I ordered this little garden flag because I am having a luau and thought it would be cute to hang out front. I looked for quite a while trying to find a tropical themed flag that didn't say something along of the lines of ""It's five o'clock somewhere"" and I finally found this one. I really liked the way this one looked online so I ordered it. Well it arrived yesterday - in a giant box, by the way, big enough to put a 12-pack of toilet paper in! I opened it up and thought, this doesn't look quite like I remember. So I pulled up my order, and sure enough, the picture shows a turquoise background, but the one I received is white. Now I don't know if I got one that is really faded or if this is what it is really supposed to look like, but it is definitely not quite as vibrant as the one advertised."
2,Too Small,I thought it was going to be bigger. It is way too small for the price. I would have liked it a lot had it been larger
4,nice flag,would have 5 stars but the 4 stapels that seal the bag are also in the flag. Be careful when you remove them
4,They should put running in the title,"If you read the previous review and are considering not getting these shoes, just remember, these are NOT cross trainers. As RUNNING shoes they are actually very good, light weight, and easy to run in. I haven't been running for a long while (a couple of years so far), but of the various types and brands of shoes I have owned these rank very highly and would gladdly recommend them to anyone who is a runner."
1,Worst New Balance Cross Trainer I have ever had..,"This is my fourth pair of New Balance Cross Trainers and these are the worse. I had the 1006 and 1005, then a pair of 600s before them. These are supposed to be the latest and greatest, but they are terrible. I do a lot of circuit training classes and I was feeling a sharp pain in my left foot whenever I bent my foot in these shoes.Very disappointing for a new balance shoe, I would not recommend and returning these shoes."
4,Probably not as exciting as 'the real thing'.....,"Probably not as exciting as 'the real thing'..... but an interesting read, anyway, with an unintentional ring of the 80's throughout."
3,Not as informative as I had hoped,"I found this book to be very helpful, but the chapters were shorter than I would have liked. Also, most of this information can be found on the web. Probably easier and no doubt cheaper to just surf around for a while."
3,Come to the Table....,This book leaves something to be desired in it's look and presentation but the information is useful and a good springboard for further conversations.
1,The recordings are not by the original artists,"The makers of this CD purposely mislead you into thinking that you are buying an album with a compilation of songs performed by the original artists. Read the fine print on the album cover. It's remakes by a bad cover band (The Countdown Singers, whoever they are). You wouldn't buy it if you knew it was a remake, so that's why the producers purposely hide that fact. Don't buy it. You'll be really mad at yourself for wasting the money."
1,Tribute album,"This is a tribute album...I didn't pay close enough attention to notice that the songs are performed by the ""Countdown Singers"" and not the original artists. Would be a great compilation otherwise..."
4,My Teenager liked this book,"I am from the Netherlands and because I hate it when I want some information on a book and it is nowhere to be found, I,ve decided to write a little about this book.My daughter read this one. it is part 5 of The Kelly Blake Teen model series, but you can read it seperatly.My daughter wants to read the other books now also.Description:Kelly is in Houston for a modeling contest, the chance to represent an entire line of designer fashions! The competition's stiff, and kelly is glad to have her friend Paisley along. But Paisley thinks they're only there to have a good time, and she promptly sets up a double date!Kelly can't resist the change to have some fun, as long as the contest judges don't find out. Is she headed for texas sized double?The book was easy to read funny and enjoyable."
3,A bit disjointed,"Despite what many say this is not a horrible story. In fact, the plot itself is quite good. The problem is that it was written by seven different writers, each doing thier own chunks of the storyline. They all do a fine job, but the end result is a disjointed narrative. If this had been a mini series written and drawn by one creative team(like Crisis on Infinite earths) it would be a classic. As it is, it was not and is just a fun, but mindless and ulitimately forgettable romp."
1,what a mess,"what a mess...really i sat down with this and barely understood a single thing that was going on...does aquaman die, for real?? wonder woman to?? is steel dead?? whats doomsday doing here...whys there a random supergirl story (with awful art) chucked in there...why is superman fighting with darkseid one moment and then with him the next...whys zod there...whos the random ghost girl luthor keeps seeing...non of this makes sense...not the way to do crossovers at allthe best work ive seen done with superman in recent years has been on JLA by grant morrison...buy some of thatavoid this unless you enjoy being confused to the high heavens"
1,Terrible,"This book is a collection of one of the worst ""earth shattering"" DC events in a long time.I'm not sure if it's the story or the way it's presented (maybe parts are missing) but it absolutely makes no sense whatsoever. It's boring, convoluted and confusing. The art is passable, and even good in certain issues, but that's not enough to keep me interested.What a mess. This is why I stopped collecting comics on a regular basis and started buying TPBs/Graphic Novels. This is a waste of paper."
2,"O.K., But Weak.","O.K. read. Probably 2 1/2 stars. A little simplistic and predictable. Enough to keep you going, but kinda weak."
1,"Cloth is easier, and what does that say?","We tried this product because both of our children go to daycare, and using cloth diapers while they are there is not an option...yet we wanted a diaper that was more environmentally conscious and better for our baby's skin.These diapers are HORRIBLE. The sticky tabs don't stick very well, and FORGET it if you have lotion or diaper ointment on your hands, you will NEVER get them on your child!Other than the fact that we had to throw out just about as many as we used (we even tried taping them on...it doesn't work) the diaper itself works just fine.My advice, though...don't waste your $$...surprisingly enough for our family, cloth has been WAY easier to deal with, and for daycare we have chosen a different product."
1,Super Thick,This was the first Chlorine/Gell Free Diaper I have ever tried. I was not happy with them. They are so thick my daughter could barely close her legs. I thought maybe since they were so thick it would help hold things in her diaper but it didn't. I do like their wipes though =)
1,Not my favorite natural diaper.,"These are not my favorite. I found that they kept my daughter too wet and she started to show signs of irritation! They are also very bulky, like your diapering your tiny baby with a book."
5,"Wonderful, well written, yummy recipes","She has a good style and makes all the food sound interesting. Also great pictures. The recipes are well thought out, and delicious."
5,Two in one classic cartoons,"If you're a fan of Fievel and his friends and foes, you'll have to own this double video, with excellent animation, and many entertaining songs like 'Somewhere Out There', so forget about the other two following direct to video sequels!"
5,Must Read for Stay-at-Home Moms,"Celebrate Home is the most comprehensive book I have read on at-home parenting. The layout and tips are arranged in such a way that they are easy to refer back to time after time. Angie Peters offers down to earth, practical advice on parenting. And reminds us to be realistic as we evaluate our accomplishments.Great gift for any mom, but especially for stay-at-home moms!"
1,They need to put in more info,This has some information about reef tanks and some good picturesbut what's the sense of having good pictures but the informationdoes not benefit you with your reef aquarium what's the senseof buying it for it's just a wast of time and money.
2,Description (when I bought) was incomplete (READ THIS),"As we have a need to run two propane units at the same time, I was originally excited to find what I thought would meet our need. However, upon our attempt to hookup to the tee, we found that it allows you to ""T"" from a large propane tank (e.g., standard 20-lb tank), but delivers two attachments that are suitable for appliances using only the 1-lb campground propane tanks.If you are looking for a split from a 20-lb tank to provide 2 1-lb tank connections, this will probably meet your need. However, unless Amazon updates their description, you need to be aware that this will not provide you with a split akin to 2 20-lb tank connections."
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what I was looking for. All of the inputs/outputs fit as they should. We are using it to feed 2 small stoves from one source. Do not know about the extended quality, but for a start.. it works perfect."
3,Nicely constructed,"Nice product, but did not meet my needs. I had to return it because it did not allow me to connect two items that had different connections."
2,One word describes the book,"Verbose! The authors spend pages upon pages wasting trees trying to explain a concept that could be explained using one paragraph. The authors go in circles in my opinion, sometimes i feel that they forget what they had initially started. And the shyness to use math and write out what could be written as a single equation makes the book about 600 pages when it should only be 200."
5,Great game for the price!,"My 9 year old son loves this. He likes the variety of games and the small travel size. It's not great graphics, but they are still very good. And the price was just right."
5,"A brilliant, affirming book","This book is a must-read for any parent with a challenging teenage daughter. I cried while reading sections of the book, but it helped to reassure me that I am not alone as I watch my daughter stumble along the rocky path between adolescence and adulthood. This is a totally brilliant and much-needed book."
2,"very serious situations, very little hope","I got this book hoping for some stories of dealing with ordinary adolescent angst. If you've read the book that this book takes the title from -- Reviving Ophelia -- you might expect the book to help with adolescent shyness, social awkwardness, the problem of girls losing their voices. Instead, this book offers anecdotes about very serious situations -- anorexia leading to death, drug use, violence -- and there is very little hope in the scenarios."
4,Worthwhile Read,This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I read it. I applaud all the contributors to this book for their bravery and honesty. It is a worthwhile book to read for parents of adolescent/teenage girls.
1,Boring,"The problem with this CD is that every measure receives equal emphasis. The musical director appears to have no concept of strong and weak measures, or of other ways to shape the phrases beautifully. The result is a concert of beautiful old favorites that puts the listener to sleep."
5,Great memento for your young child to remember family,"This is a great little book that has slots to put your pictures into it. Great to use before a trip when your child will be traveling away from their family (like custody trips). After your pictures are developed you can put them into the book and show others. Works great for show and tell or to remember that special family member (it has slots for mom, dad, pal, grandparents, etc). Can also be used with the My Vacation trip to take pictures of the family and put in pictures of yourselves doing things on vacation."
2,Pace: Slower Than Slow,"An interesting premise of a bedridden heroine, a gold-digging nanny, a family curse, blackmail and suspicion gets bogged down midway in this, my least favorite, of Dorothy Eden's mysteries. The characteristics of Eden's other books are here--the heroine solves the mystery piece by piece and there's always a touch of romance--but the excessively slow pace of action made me lose interest long before the mystery was solved. My recommendation: Skip this Eden book and enjoy the others, especially ""An Important Family""."
2,"best film? awarded?..etc...fun for kids, maybe.","If you never seen Japanese movies you may enjoi this flick but primitive is the best word. Low budget, ugly actresses, artificial, without purpose etc. These pink eigas are made to make living not to impress art world and low standard is key word here. If you are into something impressive try ""The Glamorous life of Sachiki Hanai"""
5,Great for the horse racing fanatic!,"""Old Friends"" is an excellent book for any horse racing fan's library. I read a story a day and have been enlightened by them all. Reading about these older horses is great because it lets me relive their racing days, even though I was not born while most of these horses ran. I am always on a quest to learn about as many racehorses as I can and this book really taught me about many older horses I have missed out on! Buy this book today and you'll never regret it! Awesome photos as well as awesome stories!!"
5,Very nice,"You would be foolish to pass this up at this price. Fantastic bargain, almost worth getting three or four of these babies just for the savings. And, when you give them as a gift, boy-howdy do they make an impression. Very good for the ""hey, you owe me one"" department. Get your own today."
4,Love the Album Cover,"I had the lp of this and loved the cover and the cover song. Would love to see this re-released, since I don't have the Vinyl anymore"
5,"For just an instant, I had hair again!","This is far and away Henry Gross' best effort. If you listen to this album (remember albums?), he was ahead of his time and yet captured the essence of the heady days of the early/mid-70s. I was so pleased to get this on CD; I had really forgotten just how good it was. Thanks for making an old man happy!!"
5,Refreshing eye gel,"I do not particularly like using alot of products on my face, however this eye gel was great. It is not heavy and is cooling to the skin. It absorbs into the skin quickly and I have had no problems with it irritating my very sensitive skin."
2,Not worth it,"Been vegan since '95, and I've used this for years. Just doesn't do much from my perspective. I like Gabriel Cosmetic's eye cream better."
5,Very talented author,"Dan Simmons is really a great author. If you enjoyed the Hyperion series, there is another short story that takes place after the series's conclusion. The other stories are also pretty good."
2,Not the best Simmons,"The Simmons I love is the one in Hyperion, Summer of Night, and The Terror. Stories with a good balance of good underlying ideas for the plot, exceptional character development, and phiolosophical themes. The stories in Worlds Enough have only one of them: philosophy. Lots and lots of it. There is so little else going on than one wonders why doesn't Simmons just write a non fiction philosophical book and get it out of his system already. The last story in particular was so dull I couldn't wait for it to end. The others were mostly Zen riddles, you know, the kind that leaves you scratching your head wonderig what the heck did you just read? The only passable one was the story set in the Hyperion universe, which earns the few stars I am giving."
4,A great collection of stories,"I recently finished Dan Simmons' Worlds Enough and Time, a collection of 5 tales of ""speculative fiction"" (that's what it says on the cover). As you may know from my review earlier this year of his novel Ilium, I've been a fan of his work for quite some time. He's inventive, and always has interesting, flawed characters.I quite enjoyed reading these stories. They were all just long enough to read one before sleeping. The stories are:Looking for Kelly Dahl - one day, while attempting suicide, a teacher's life, and universe, changesOrphans of the Helix - a return to the Hyperion universeThe Ninth of Av - I noticed this as a kind of prequel to IliumOn K2 with Kanakaredes - mountain-climbing, with an alienThe End of Gravity - an American investigating, and reminiscing, on the Russian space programFor fans of Simmon's work, this is definitely worth a read!"
4,none,"Simmons' 'Worlds Enough and Time' is breath taking in scope and vision, and shows why he is continuely a master at reshaping SF and the reader's mind. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
4,Great insight into the tv news biz,"This book presents insights into the world of how tv stations make decisions on news coverage, talent, how bad those decisions can be, and sheds light on how few stations there are that actually do a good job of it.It is also interesting to find out how many unhappy tv journalists there are out there.He offers solutions as to how to make your tv career more fulfilling, and that was valuable. I would recommend it for people in the tv industry, but for the average person who doesn't know the ins and outs of tv, it's not very useful."
4,"Correct List of Episodes! - - includes Spongebob, Dora the Explorer, and Blue's Room","ACTUAL LIST OF EPISODES:Spongebob Squarepants Christmas:- Christmas Who? (double length episode)+ 8 ""Merry Episodes""- Procrastination- Snowball Effect- Survival of the Idiots- Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV- Chocolate with Nuts- As Seen on TV- Pizza Delivery- Squeaky BootsDora's Christmas:- A Present for Santa- Rapido Tico!- Quack! Quack!- School PetBlue's Room Holiday Wishes:- Blue's Room Holiday- Can You Help?- Look Carefully...- Patience~ A pretty good collection for younger ones - I wouldn't pay full price, as all of the Spongebob episodes, and likely the Nick Jr. ones as well, play on Nickelodeon frequently, and there aren't any good special features"
1,Need more information,I am very curious about this dvd--or should I say three dvd's--they need to list some of the tv shows included in this set..I mean for the money it would be nice to know what you are getting...
2,Falls way short of the mark,"I expected this book to be filled with beautiful shots of the New England countryside, scenic lighthouses and historic sites. The first twenty pages are devoted to brief history and old b/w photos from the 1890's and this section is enjoyable. Unfortunately its downhill from there. I wasn't looking for photos of the Kennedy birth home, a two page spread of a rusty ""junk shop"", a full page dedicated to a boat shed and buoys, an oversized photo of a barge on the river, or two pages allocated to a diner in RI. The photography is sharp and colorful and the few photos of the NE countryside and Sturbridge Village are good. Unfortunately the less interesting subjects prevail."
3,GOOD BUT NOT WELCOMING CONDITION,I thank you for the book. It's filled with beautiful words.Better condition would have made me more comfortable.
1,Video death,"I had this camcorder for 4 months, was reasonably happy with the quality of the video. I intended to tape my sons's one-act play, but luckily decided to check the camcorder ahead of time. It would not record video and showed a ""lens-cap"" error. Needless to say the lens cap was not on. I called JVC, they said to take the battery off for 2 hours and try it again. No luck. I called a service center since the camcorder was out of warranty and found it would cost $50 to look at the camera plus the cost of the repair. I called Sam's Club where I had purchased the camcorder and they agreed to take it back. After looking into buying another camcorder, I found that JVC and Sony are both famous for this problem, along with refusing to stand by their products. There may be a class action lawsuit filed against Sony because of this. Lesson learned - buy service agreements with camcorders."
1,Do not waste your money or time,"I purchased this camcorder less than a year ago. I had to exchange it within 4 days of purchase becasue of the lense cover error, now 10 months later my second one is doing the same thing. JVC pretty much says it is a fluke thing, I guess not. Also AmericanTV where it was purchased is doing the oh well as well. I will never purchase another JVC product or shop american. I have lost alot of memories do to this very common proplem."
1,Lens cap error!!,"Unfortunately, I also have the same problem almost everybody has. I used my camera 5 times in 3 years and now it won't work. Don't waste your money on this!!!!"
1,Another Lens Cap disaster,My GZ-MG21U HDD has same problem. Use very few times. Stopped working since last 3 months with Lens Cap Error. Sent it to JVC Center. They are asking $275 to fix. BEWARE before buying. Read reviews carefully. This looks to be widespread problem.
1,Duh...Lens Cap Error!,"I wish I had read these reviews long ago. I've owned my JVC GRDF 450U for about 14 months...it worked fine...until I needed it a few days ago. I've spent hours trying to figure out what the heck I had done to cause the ""lens cap error""...only to find that it wasn't me. The repair shop tells me it'll cost between $175 and $225 to fix it...plus tax. Right. Sorry I bought this camcorder...and the extended battery packs, as well as the wide angle and telephoto lens. Needless to say JVC ain't getting any more of my money."
2,If you dont use it! You loose it!...JVC,"I have been an avid JVC customer. I guess this is because JVC in Asia where I was from are good products, just like my Toyotas, reliable. So when I came to the USA. All JVC appliances and equiptments that I may use, I have. From home AV recievers, tv, lcd auto stereos, speakers, dvd players, mega cd changers. MOST DID NOT LAST LONG. The only one working are my TVs and the ones I often use. I know now for a fact that JVC products break if you dont use them, but I do not have the time anymore. As I am writing this review AmericanTV will repair my JVC GRDF450U MiniDV Camcorder but I will have to buy a new camera for my daugthers recital because they may not be able to fix it quicker."
4,Works great for me,"I have only positive things to say about this camera. We took it to Orlando with us last year....even recorded while riding splash mountain and it did fine! I like how light-weight it is and how easy it is for me to use. Guess if I had to say one bad thing about it, that would be that my husband has trouble using it since it's small and harder for him to hold."
3,Confused!!!,"I went on the consumer report web-site, and found this camcorder to be their second best pick out of 45. It has the most features available out their, and takes still pictures too. It does tend to have more repairs, along with Sony, than other models. So I'm confused whether or not to purchase this camcorder. I will continue my search."
3,Not very stable,"I was hoping to use these out in my paddock to throw the saddles on just before tacking up. Wrong. When I throw a saddle on it, it is not secure. Any little brush up against the saddle will cause it to fall. The wooden bar is so narrow that there is little stability. Also, I am not sure why it is called collapsible. I was thinking that they could be stored in a collapsible position- I couldn't find a way to do that. But they can easily be taken off of the mounting ring to store away. The price was very good though and I guess if you are very careful not to bump the saddle,or have a type of saddle that is more balanced on the bar, it could work."
3,Don't skimp when it comes to your first analysis textbook,"First off, I haven't purchased or read this text, but a thirty-five dollar textbook that introduces ONLY the lebesgue integral, and almost certainly only on the real number line, is not a good investment. You would do much better to stick with the classic, Walter Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" where the Lebesgue integral is introduced in a logical manner and in a way that encourages further education.Rudin has frequently been criticized for being ""too dry,"" but a patient and dedicated student will be capable of steady progress, and as the student is forced for him/herself to decide the worth of the theorems presented, they gain a taste of what theorems really are important (a definite must for any mathematics students contemplating graduate school).Used copies of Rudin abound, so there is no excuse for purchasing anything but the best."
4,another fine novel from Iris Murdoch,"While this novel is not as well constructed as ""The Bell,"" it is still a fine novel. There is an obvious reference to the story of Gawain and his nemesis in the novel, a reference which is made explicit by a couple of the characters in the narrative. The ending, with its multiple marriages, is a little over the top in terms of contrivance; but, as Ms. Murdoch said herself in interviews -- in a passage quoted by the news wire after her death -- her novels have a beginning, middle, and end, which is more than we can say for most overtly ""literary"" novels these days. A great novel."
2,Not a fan of this knife,"I bought this pocket knife to replace a Laguiole knife I lost in the woods. While the handle is really nice, the mechanism is not very good. If folds down and cradles off-center, the way I would expect a $10 knife to do. The mechanism is too stiff to be reasonable, plus it has not held an edge very well during the few times I used it. It has since been replaced.The sheath and box are nice, but not practical if you are buying as a gift."
2,An insignificant tome,"In this little book, which reads as though it were slapped together with as much as ten minutes' thought process, Sally Brown admires a neighbor's pine tree; it's perfect in size and shape, and is (by her accounts) begging to be decorated in her house. The dilemma - it's in the neighbor's yard, not hers. She hopes for a miracle, and hey presto! The tree falls, and Sally feels that it belongs to her. No dilemma, no mental anxieties over removing the tree, it simply belongs to her. The ""showdown"" between Sally and the neighbor is a remarkable display of mediocrity.My kids, bless their hearts, hated the book. However, I can't give any kisd' book less than two stars because, if nothing else, it gets them reading. Sheesh."
5,hurray for tushies!,"Although Tushies are definately more expensive than the more mainstream, gel-filled diapers, they are well worth it. On a recent trip we temporarily switched to Huggies to avoid having to pack and bring what we knew we'd be able to buy on vacation. My daughter immediately got the worst diaper rash of her little life. Whether this is just coincidental or not we'll never know but I do know that I feel better about putting her in a more natural alternative."
3,Ok...but expected more for the price,"I really expected these to be a bit beefier than they are for the price. The handles are thin, and hard to grip. They work, but I will find others in the near future."
2,Misleading advertizing,"Though this claims to be from ""MIU France"" it has nothing to do with France at all - that is just the name of the company. The products are made in ZhongTang, China or similar and imported to the US. The company itself is from Hong Kong. Very deceptive. (see their website www.miufrance.com) Amazon should disclose this!"
3,"Nice spatulas, the handles are uncomfortable","They are nice silicone spatulas with stainless steel handles. The handles are thin strips of metal, and are not very comfortable to hold."
3,I have had better spatulas,"I loved how these spatulas looked and I figured by the price they would be state of the art. BUT...the rubber ends slides off very easily, so they are not as high end as expected. I have bought $5.00 spatulas that have NEVER fell apart, so I think I will stick with them.Too bad because they look so cool."
1,"piu, miu","These spatulas may look nice, but they are thoroughly inflexible. This makes it difficult to scrape things from a bowl. I cannot recommend this product."
4,Supercool,These are the best 120mm adjustable fans on Amazon for the price. Very quiet when placed on low and medium settings. I didn't care that they didn't come in the original boxes because the plastic bags were labeled and neat in appearance. Just wished they would have had more in stock as I purchased the last three.
4,good book,"I buyed this book because I'm a studious of mineralogy.This is a good and accurate book, also if it isn't very large.It explain very well all the structures and types of the saline deposits including notices about other saline minerals s bischofite, carnallite, anidrite ecc eccIt comprises also a very good index including all the treatised subject and minerals."
2,Misnamed and Inferior,"This is not a soundtrack but a l987 Chichester stage cast recording. The original cast album (1964 Lyric Theatre, London) recording starred June Bronhill and Keith Michell ( EMI Angel West End CD number 0777 7 89059 2 09 ..digitally remastered) This is the definitive version. In the Chichester revival June's voice is 23 years older, and sounds it, and Michell was replaced in all but one song by a lessersinger. Lovers of this charming show should pursue the EMICD, and hopefully Amazon will include it in future listings."
3,Good Recording of a Good Show,"A good recording of a good show. Very British, pre- LloydWebber.Not up to American standards but still has a few nice moments in this retelling of the Barretts of Wimpole St."
5,Getting back in the game.,"I stopped playing golf about 15 years ago. I needed a refresher and this video renewed my enthusiasm for the game. Clear, concise, well presented. It is for beginners, but a great way to get back ""on course."""
2,alphy hydroxy acids not needed,"would be the perfect lotion minus the alphy hydroxy acids that rip and peel the skin off, perfect for winter!!"
2,Falls short of being really helpful.,Covers maybe 40% of the subject parts. Lots of gaps in parts. If you need a part number for the complete engine or the cylinder heads you're covered but don't expect many other engine parts. I even found interchange lists not connected with any part.
5,Amazing Saw,"An amazing saw. Well made, tremendous design, easy to use and very accurate. I wish I had bought the overpriced stand. Delivery was slow."
5,Great tool for an amature or pro alike,"I bought this to use on some tile work I am planning. I started with a small bathroom where I was installing slate. This saw works like a charm. It cuts through the slate like it is butter. My only complaint is that it took me a while to figure out how to install the blade. Should have been a snap, but the directions were very weak in that regard. I finally figured out how to remove the blade cover, and the rest of the install went smooth.This thing is dead accurate. I was even able to cut off a sliver when I measured a little too long. I love the tool, and will use it at least two more times in other tile jobs. Most likely my sons will end up borrowing it also. It is expensive, but in tools, you gotta buy the ones that work, otherwise, you will regret spending money on tools that do not function, or only last a short time."
5,Great,I was going to retile my whole downstairs (1400 sq ft) and needed a wet saw and decided on this one. I had no problems with the saw as I was able to do all the cuts i needed to do. There was even one where I had to do a square hole in the middle of the tile and this did that perfectly.
5,DEWALT 10 INCH TILE SAW AND STAND,THE SAW ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION AND WITHIN A WEEK. THE STAND ARRIVED IN JUST A FEW DAYS. THE QUALITY OF THE SAW IS AMAZING. THE PRICE WAS THE BEST I FOUND IN SEVERAL DAYS OF SEARCHING.DEWALT D24000S Heavy-Duty 10-inch Wet Tile Saw with StandDEFINITELY RECOMMEND.
1,Very Disappointed!,"Before I purchased this saw I read the recent review about the motor giving out right away and just figured that person got a lemon, but within 30 minutes of using this saw mine started to do the same thing. You could hear the whining start on the motor and then smoke started to come out. I was only cutting 1"" thick cultured stone and ceramic tile with it.I am not sure what Dewalt is trying to accomplish by cheaping out with this saw, but it is very frustrating to be in the middle of a job and have a brand new saw die. I can see wanting to saving money if you can, but the saw needs to work. It's too bad because the features of the saw are great and for the money, it did everything I needed it to do. It's a shame so many companies are going the wrong direction to save money. You are only alienating the people that buy your products. Or used to. Anyway, save your money and buy an MK, Felker or Imer saw."
2,A TOY for real stone,"This may be a great saw with all of the bells and whistles for a homeowner, but if you ever plan to cut natural stone (especially 18"" x 18"") stay away from this saw. It plainly doesn't have enough power to handle the big jobs. All of the other features, however, are quite good. If you lay less than 2,000 sqft of tile per year, or never plan to cut 1/2"" thick tile, this saw will work perfectly, but if you are looking for a professional piece of equipment, stick with Target or Felker"
2,wet saw,"I have this saw for two months, I liked the table and the ringlings, work good, the contaner for the water is nice the singned, but the terrible problem is the motter, no to much power, and the noise is like a big truck. I dont recomend this saw, if you do not like the noise. I am going back for my old master saw."
2,"good for home use, not commercial.","When I bought this machine, I liked all the features, an they really worked great for one year, all the reviews I read here are for two months of usage. If you are a commercial installer, dont go with this saw.After 1 year ,replaced the motor brushes, the water`pump and finally tried to replace the worn motor bearings, I said tried because every screw will break if you try to disamble it, right now I have a useless one year used dewalt tile saw, the good thing? the stand."
1,Great When it WORKS!!!,"Length:: 0:40 MinsWe are now on the THIRD repair on this machine. We have used it in total three times. The blade wobbles after two or three cuts, the bearings go out everytime and they replace the part but that is time and money lost. I don't know how they need to solve the problem but I would wait until they have the bugs worked out first!! Sorry the video is sideways but you get the point!!"
2,not very favorable.,"i've tried her weight loss suggestions and immortality suggestions to see if they are true or not. And they did not work for me or for Linda, who died in 1995. I feel that she should have made sure that the information is valid before printing it for the whole damned world."
3,How did she die,"I loved this book. It was far-fetched at times. But, it made me think. The question is, HOW DID SHE DIE??? She speaks of immortality, and has been dead for 3 years. Please let me know I am curious. JBVPhurst@prodigy.net"
5,A virtual bible of new age information,"Having read many many ""new age"" books, I consider this one my bible of everything esoteric. It includes such topics as immortality, money, vegetarianism, numerology, astrology, and karma. I found this book when I first started ""searching"" and refer to it all the time. Great for getting a working knowlege of many aspects of spirituality"
4,i loved this book,"i have always had a passion for linda goodmans work, while i don't enjoy the publications post her death, her star signs is great for anyone wanting to tinkle around and learn a new vocabulary, her writing style has a tendency to make you feel as if you are reading a mystery novel."
3,Read the Numerology section only,"Linda Goodman clearly had a role in bringing astrology mainstream. This seems to be her attempt to get into esoteric topics. She doesn't seem too knowledgeable. It would be better to read Steiner, Cayce, Paul Foster Case. There are many more serious writers on esoteric topics. And even real live teachers.The discussion of numerology is interesting, but the ""Compound Numbers"" relate to Tarot keys of the same number. It's not that mysterious, but maybe was in 1987. The single numbers are totally idiotic because they are just descriptions of Sun signs. 4 is the same as an Aquarian and I guarantee you, someone born on May 4 or 13 is not going to seem Aquarian. IFHMSO."
2,In The days of the Vaqueros,In The Days of the VaquerosBy Russell FreedmanIf you are looking for a book about horses this is not a book for you. This is a book about the Vaqueros and only the Vaqueros. This book starts out well but after a while is starts to get boring. Vaqueros were the first cowboys. They started out as slaves for the Spaniards. This book is for young adults. A kid that is 11 or older could read it but they might have trouble with it.By Julie
4,"Quick, inexpensive, satisfying, portable","You get a foam cup full of dried noodles, vegetables and little bits of beef. Fill with boiling water to the line on the inside of the cup, wait 3 minutes, stir and you have lunch. Its not gourmet food but it will save you from spending 6 bucks at the deli for a sandwich. The instructions say that microwaving is not recommended. I fill mine from the hot water spigot on the spring water dispenser here at work. Our coffeemaker has a hot water dispenser too. Accompany this with an apple and call it lunch. :)"
4,Great save for one omission,"I would only take 1/2 star away if I could. My only complaint (which is small) is that over 4 CDs and a DVD worth of music there is no version of ""Every Little Kiss"" to be found. Would have loved to hear a re-arranged live version or the video. Anyway...very nice collection overall."
5,Mais de 20 anos de carreira !!,"Bruce Hornsby é simplesmente um ícone da música mundial. Com seu primeiro hit, em 1986, The Way It Is, logo conquistou milhes de fs ao redor do mundo. Do pop ao country, do jazz ao bluegrass, ele impressiona pela forma de tocar e cantar. As músicas Mandolin Rain, The Show Goes On, Dreamland e The End Of The Innocence foram melodias que marcaram minha vida. Tudo de Bruce Hornsby impressiona. A quantidade de shows ao redor dos Estados Unidos e Europa impressionam !! Só espero que um dia ele passe pelo Brasil..."
3,Real Bruce fans cheer,This box set revitalized the faith that Great composers are not shy. to hear what every Bruce Hornsby fan anticipates every time he comes to town Live .A timid music lover should open their ears and enjoy what a REAL composer with a love of life and pleaseing the fans. Some muicians play it the same way every night and release a greatest hits as is NOT Bruce.Bruce Reinvents himself every night and so should his box set.Enjoy and listen often so as to hear the freshness of a long and still growing career.
2,20 year fan and Hornsby Buff still found surprises,"I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs. I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here. I loved the DVD of some of his performances. There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan."
1,Not happy,I bought this cd/dvd set because of the excellent reviews that I read on Amazon. But after getting the set I have to say I was very disappointed. About the only thing that saves this boxed set is the DVD. I for one would not recommend this boxed set to anyone. Most if not all of his songs have been butchered beyond recognition.
1,REAL BAD,"This is a complete trashing of Hornsby by Hornsby.Bruce if you read this, Bring back the Range and get back to your roots, You do some very Beautiful stuff but sadly NOT this mess.A total waste of Money"
1,Yee-Ha!!,"If you enjoy all of Bruce's songs being turned COUNTRY. This is the CD set for you! No wonder the price is half of the list price. This CD set STINKS! You'll want to just skip, skip, skip through the songs - unless you enjoy having your favorite songs messed up?!"
1,It is a joke & it will not kill any bug,The size is just slight bigger than match box and it will not kill any bug! Be aware it is a scam!
4,Bday gift for my wife,"My wife wanted a sports watch for her bday. I ordered this watch on Amazon. She loves the style, but the first watch would lose hours each day. I phoned the vendor and he immediately shipped a replacement watch, and included pre-paid return packaging for the defective watch. The replacement watch showed up within 3 days and works great. Wife is happy. I was impressed with the way the seller handled the claim. Don't know what caused the problem with the first watch, but stuff happens. The replacement watch works great and my wife loves it. Comfortable and stylish rubber band, chrome rim with an easy to read white face. Manual wind up mechanism with date and time. Recommended."
4,an outstanding reference,"Schwabl's Quantum Mechanics is a superb supplement to any course on quantum mechanics. After struggling through Griffith's obfuscated discussion of addition of angular momenta, Schwabl's exposition was my savior. I would not, however, try to learn QM solely from Schwabl (i.e. self-study) because he frequently skips derivations and says things like ""it is immediately apparant that...,"" which can be frustrating. However, as a text for a course or as a supplementary resource, Schwabl is extrememly valuable."
2,"I have been using this book in class, and I am not impressed","While this book certainly covers a lot of ground, it is painfully lacking in derivations or examples. I beleive it would be a reasonable book to use (as a reference) for someone who has already mastered quantum mechanics, but it is almost impossible to learn out of. Also, if you want a very terse, yet comprehensive reference, why bother with something other than Landau?"
3,Necessary Evil,"Purchased for a JVC GY700 camera. The plates from my previous JVC cameras, D-5000 do not work with this one. The older ones are much sturdier than this one. Just a slight cosmetic change from previous model has forced me to purchase a new one. Plates really should come with the camera when they change design. Like I said, necessary evil, you really don't have any other choice as far as I know. Handle with care, seems a bit fragile."
5,dead skin gone,love this product. it gets rid of the dead skin sells and my skin looks healthy and younger than my age.
5,More torque,"I had a little trouble fitting this into my S60R but it, was fairly easy to install. Great product better gas mileage and I noticed quicker take off speed as well. And it'll save me money in replacement air filterspas well. Best price I could was here on my favorite shopping site Amazon.comHighly recommend.."
3,"Product was good, but slightly damaged from shipping","As it says in the title. The product was good, installed really easily. Only problem was the package was damaged from shipping. The filter itself was bent a little. It still works but it doesn't look pretty."
2,Not a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,"It seems to me that Sue Teele had to search hard for a new spin on the multiple intelligences of learning in order to create ""her own"" theory. The analogy of learning as compared to rainbows was cumbersome and did not seem to follow a smooth path of thought. If a reader's main desire is to learn about the multiple intelligences, this would not be the best choice in literature. However, on the bright side, Teele includes a chapter with sample lesson plans which incorporate the multiple intelligences."
2,mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. Sutin gives the impression that he interviewed me extensively, but he actually used quotes from other interviews and never met me, although I did briefly answer three of his questions by letter. Furthermore, I must disagree with most of his conclusions. Since I spent ten years with Phil, and those were the last ten years of his life, I believe that I know more about him than a biographer who never met him and simply read about him."
5,The official bio on PKD,"This one is dense so I'll keep it brief. Read this about 15 years ago. Lawrence Sutin's bio is the official one, though Anne's(Dick's 3rd wife?)is a great addition. It's jam-packed and Sutin did his homework for sure. There is everything from his home and personal life, to writing inDivine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dickthe SF ""ghetto,"" philosophies, places he lived... the usual bio material, but very well crafted and researched. Sutin was a friend and gathered some great material on Phil. There are also some plot summeries of key novels, and the events under which they were written. It's dense as hell and fun to read. A must for any Philip K. Dick fan or collector. There is so much information, it is overwhelming... but also a great reference on this special man and his work. Snag it up!"
1,Poor recording of live performance/s,"These are NOT the original studio recordings which we heard on the radio when they were hit songs.The recording quality is very poor. I suspect thatit was recorded with amateur equipment with one stereo microphone in front of the stage far removed from the band. Also, most of the songs are performed at much faster tempos than the original recordings. The words ""Live recording"" are inscribed on the back side of the container in small letters just above the bar code -- where nobody looks. The tin box housing these recordings is the best thing about this collection and the only reason it deserves even a fraction of one star. Unless you are a fan who wants to have everthing ever released with Brown's name on it, you should avoid this collection like the plague."
1,Godfather of Soul Collection Set,Disappointed in this collection set. All the songs in this collection set are performed and recorded in his later years and revised or/and digitally extended.
1,Over the top packaging - Absolutely Awful Performances,"First off, I love James Brown and when I saw this I thought I just had to have it. Unfortunately this is three CDs of the worst live sessions I've ever heard. The recording quality is terrible. JB always ups the tempo when he did live sets but this is insane.The booklet that comes with it is very nicely done. The metal box it comes in is a bit silly but it'll be a good addition for my garage to hold screw bits and the like."
4,The most affordable way to drink quality yerba mate.,"Keep in mind before purchasing that this is a lighter yerba mate and lacks the high strength that Guayaki brand has. But it is also about twice as cheap as Guayaki so there is a trade-off. Overall, I was satisifed with this product even if it could be a little stronger."
2,Poor Tea Bag construction - Good tea,I ordered a six pack of this tea and hopefully the other boxes are not like the first. The tea bags break open and the tea string is not properly stapled to the bag. The tea is great but am very disappointed that I can't return this. I will stick with the Guayaki brand even though its more expensive.
5,Tasty stuff,"I like that you can brew it in cold water, although it's stronger in hot. I also liked that it's unsmoked - I was reading that some of the rumors/small studies that show mate might be mildly carcinogenic were done on smoked mate, which caused me to look for unsmoked and find this. It doesn't taste the same as smoked, understandably, but it tastes good."
4,"used it with ProCom Dual Fuel Stove - 25,000 BTU, Model# QD250T","I used this with ProCom Dual Fuel Stove - 25,000 BTU, Model# QD250T also purchased on Amazon. It worked fine for the nook that I put the stove in.The line is pretty short, but that is ok. I would rather keep the line short so it does not kink. I see some dryers that have been hooked up to propane and the flexible gas line is all 'mashed' in the corner.Put the valve on the black pipe, put some pipe dope on the connections. Came with 3 different fittings, but only used one and put the others in my spare parts box... you never know when you need one of these do dads.."
5,Best Decision I Ever Made,"I was unsure about how well this little heater would help in heating my house, but I am amazed! It has tremendously cut down on the amount of propane I am having to buy. Would highly recommend it!"
1,Doesn't include everything needed!!,"I bought this kit to hook up a 30,000 BTU Mr Heater to a propane tank. The kit states it is a ""Mr. Heater One-Stop Universal Gas-Appliance Hook-Up Kit. This one-stop universal gas-appliance hook-up kit provides everything typically needed for the installation of most gas appliances"". I thought a Mr. Heater kit would include everything needed to hook up a Mr. Heater heater. It does not. A pressure regulator is needed in addition to this kit in order to hook the Mr Heater up to the propane tank. I am extremely disappointed this was not made clear at the time of ordering the heater and kit. Would have saved me time in a time of need."
3,Product works. Hose may be too short for your use.,"Got this kit to hook up an 18000 BTU gas heater.Included all the fittings I needed. I was going from a gas log set to the gas heater. The fittings on the log set were smaller, so I'm glad I got this.The hose is short. I wanted to place the unit in the middle of my fireplace but the hose was too short. So now it's off center, and doesn't look as good as it could have.I would suggest having a longer hose available in case you need it."
2,Do not buy this kit if you are hooking up propane gas,"Please advise people that do not buy this kit if you are hooking up propane gas. I bought it by mistake, tried to hook up the propane tank with the heater and found to be not safe because of excess gas pressure from propane tank, must use with regulator."
5,A must have when installing a gas heater.,This was great to have when installing a new gas heater. We live 50 miles from a hardware store and this had everything we needed.
5,Great Universal HookupIts,"Easy to use, and very adaptable to the device which is being installed. Very well made and is well worth the money."
3,weak threads,"While tightening the gas cut off to the flex pipe, the threads stripped. Had to go to the hardware and buy another cut off. Dont over tighten, it is made in Tiawan."
3,Buy it for the valuable commentary,"His translation of the I Ching is hardly useful in daily practice, but his abundant commentary helps you in understanding the I Ching. His commentary contains portions of a long Confucianist tradition which was the standard for centuries. Only that makes this book a must."
2,Save your Money,"Generally, I am a defender of James Legge's translations against the depredations of those who would condemn him as an obfuscating embarassment in the world of Classical Chinese translations. Generally.In this case, I must admit that if you're interested at all in the Yi Jing you're better off avoiding Legge's translation entirely. In the original Chinese it is an arcane book to begin with. Legge's arcane language on top of that results in a book that is indeed a conundrum. You may as well use ""Finnegan's Wake"" for divination."
1,Avoid avoid avoid!,"Even if the klunkiness of the translation doesn't get you, the mind-bending page layout and design will make give you a screaming migraine headache and will make your fingers ache from flipping around needlessly.It's just not worth the bother."
3,"Choose the Same Author's ""Essential Homer""","This ""Essential Iliad"" contains about one third of the Iliad. There is a somewhat different abridgment of this same translation in ""The Essential Homer,"" which contains about (I reckon) 44% of the Iliad.What does the extra 11% get you? A much better and more representative distillation of the Iliad, in my opinion. For example, the passages towards the end of the Iliad that show Achilles returned to the battle in all his fury over the death of Patroclus, spitting out famous bitter speeches about life and death, are in ""Essential Homer"" but not ""Essential Iliad.""So get the ""Essential Homer"" instead."
1,Iliad by Homer,"Usually, I have been satisfied with Amazon purchases, but I was disappointed in the Iliad. The text jumped from somewhere in book 18 to 21 (entirely skipping books 19 and 20 and then books 21-24 are repeated."
4,item just as described,Item arrived ahead of scheduled date. It arrived in conditon just as described in sale ad. Very satisfied with purchase. Would buy again from seller.
5,Love this product,"I was looking for a product that was not greasy (like Burts Bees moisturizer) - this is it! It has an aroma that at first I didn't like, but it has grown on me and now I love this product! I have now tried the Nature's Gate lotion that another reviewer recommended, and I have started using that one at night instead of this expensive one. Nature's Gate is a heavier lotion, perfect for night time, and it is MUCH cheaper and goes a long way. I have continued to use this BWC lotion for daytime use because it doesn't soak up my facial powder - it dries pretty quickly after application."
4,Ultra-moisturizing without being greasy,I have oily/acne prone skin that I treat nightly with prescription retin-a. I use this over the top to prevent my skin from drying out too much from the medication. It absorbs completely without leaving my skin greasy. My only criticism is it does not prevent me from drying out during the winter - just the summer.
2,Nice visuals but poor design...,"Our son enjoyed looking at the fish, but this swing was way toofast even on the lowest setting. He was a normal size baby (8lbs). By the time he was heavy enough to swing at a normal speed, he would try to sit up to grab the fish and would flop forward. We received a Leapfrog activity seat for Christmas, and it was much more usable. It was more supportive and he did not tip over in it."
2,Not worth the money,"I had registered for this swing which I thought would be great but I wasn't able to use it for very long. If my baby was leaning to one side it wouldn't rock correctly. Also, when he hit about 12lbs (which I believe is well under the weight limit) it would barely rock with him in there. At first I thought it was the batteries but after changing them it was still barely rocking. One of these days they will make a/c adapters for all swings to save money on batteries. Anyway, I'm not impressed with this swing. Its cute but not worth the money."
1,glad to see they fixed it!,"I wrote an old review when my now one year old was almost killed in this swing. I would like everyone to know that this swing appears to have been fixed. The mesh is SOOO much smaller and I now see no problem with it at all. With that considered. I would HIGHLY recommend this swing, we LOVED it until ""the accident"" which was caused by the high mesh sides on the original version. I am sure that most of the old reviewers would agree with me. Please pay attention to the most recient reviews on most baby products because although the company may not issue a recall, they will go back and fix the problems as long as there were no deaths attributed to their product. (No matter how many NEAR deaths there might have been) Frightening isn't it?"
2,Low speed is too fast!,I was so excited to use this swing with my newborn. I figured it had 8 speeds so speed 1 would be fairly slow. Not the case as someone else wrote and I agree that the swings speed is too fast for my newborn. I love all the lights and music but this swing just is not healthy for a newborn to be in.
1,returned it,"The one plus was that Babies R Us returned this for me with no problems.It was difficult to snap the metal bars together correctly. Then, when we finally got it working, even the lowest speed was WAY too jarring for our newborn. Her head would slump all the way over no matter how I put her in the swing (why don't they make some kind of a headrest, like they do for car seats?) I tried propping her head up using blankets, etc. but those just got in the way, slipped off, etc.Then, the plastic joints (where the fish/water are on the sides) came loose and we could not get them to hook back in. They would just slip apart and the swing would come crashing down - clearly defective.Finally, when I was ""folding"" up this swing to return it, it was still quite bulky.I obviously wouldn't recommend it, and didn't buy a new one."
3,Not a necessity,We thought this swing would be a necessity since we do alot of visiting to grandpartents' and friends' houses. But we've found that our little one isn't too comfortable in it. He can't quite reach the toys because they're so far away and the swinging seat is on the large side.It came in handy when he was tired and was happy to sit and rock though.
2,Not the Best Swing in the World,"I was excited when I bought this swing because it's portable, light-weight, takes up little space, and has lights and music and toys. But, it has turned out to be a pain in the neck. When my son is sleeping in the swing, his every movement hits the toys, which make noise and wake him up - so I cut the toys off. It's also VERY difficult to get the baby out of the swing without hitting his head on the overhead bar. It's also easy for baby to stop himself from swinging - my son just grabs the bar all the time. And the worst part - my son has flipped himself out of the swing twice, even though he was strapped in !! So he has to be completely supervised while swinging. I really don't recommend this swing - it's not all that it's cracked up to be."
1,no good,"We bought this yesterday and have a 4 month baby.1. gear sound is too noisy2. speed 1 is too fast3. baby seems to be very uncomfortable when she takes a nap there (head/face is always down).therefore, we will return it soon."
5,a miracle,"I could not count how many times this swing has saved me. When my son was little it was the only thing that got him to sleep. I wish he could still have it, but he's one now. I tried the big swing with him, but he kept on crying and the bouncy chair broke. I glad I had it for him. It's great"
1,Not safe,"Please consider buying a swing with shoulder straps.If you must have this swing, NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER leave your baby alone in it, even for a second.My son tipped over in this swing while he was bending to look at the lights.He was secured with the waist straps and is not too big or too active for the swing.This swing is just not safe, in my opinion."
3,Swing moves a bit fast...even on speed 1,"The swing is great and my son appears to like it. The only issue I have, is that it moves very fast, even on speed one (of eight speed settings). He has trouble on the swing after he eats (which is typically his play time) and tends to burp up a lot on the swing as I think he actually gets a bit sick from the rapid motion.Thus, if you have a baby prone to reflux, you may be better off getting one of the baby chairs (we have the same fisher price vibrating chair with the same music, fish, etc. and he seems to like that much much better."
2,mesmerizing but uncomfortable,"Our daughter loves the lights & toys, but the seat doesn't recline enough for her to stay centered in the swing. She ends up drooping over to one side & her head smacks into the hanging fish. We got the swing when she was 2 months old & now she's 5 months & there hasn't been a stage where she has been able to use it."
2,Not that good.,Slowest speed is kind of fast. It's hard to get baby out because it swings.Baby likes much better the kick n play bouncer..
3,Given as a hand-me-down,"I have an older version of this swing a friend gave me when I found out I was pregnant. My daughter has loved it since we brought her home. She's 10 weeks, and is now fascinated by the lights and the toys - there are times when this swing is the only thing that will calm her down.However. :)It runs through batteries like you wouldn't believe - we have to replace them every other week, which gets really pricey. As I type this review, my daughter is swinging in it, and the music has just gone off-key - an indicator that the batteries are about to die again. Also, it's difficult to fold up - my technologically challenged husband still hasn't figured out how to do it; I know how to do it, but it's nearly impossible, as I don't have the strength in my hands to push out the white tabs.So, it works well as a swing, if you don't mind needing to constantly change the batteries, and if you don't plan on actually traveling with it."
4,I'm diggin' this swing.,"The music, lights and adjustable speeds are nice. I also like that I can turn off or adjust the volume of the music because my DD gets overstimulated by it sometimes. I like that I can carry it from room to room. My only wish is that it could be higher up off the floor at a certain setting. DD likes to be right next to me."
4,They grow out of it fast,We enjoyed this swing when my daughter was little but as soon as she was able to sit up she had outgrown it. SHe tried to lean over the side and actually puts her hands on the floor. (She is tiny too and can do this 14lbs at 6mo)I think a bigger baby would out grow it even sooner. My friend loaned me a swing from 2003 that is the Swingomatic type by Evenflo. It is big and takes up space but if I had to do it again I would register for that swing. My daughter is 8 months and still is entertained with the chair and the toys on the tray.
2,Don't Buy It For The Lights!,"I have returned 2 now for the light going out in the third position after only a month's use. I called Fisher Price to find out if I can change the bulb, and you can't! I then complained to them that for $65+ it would be nice if all 4 lights stayed on after a month's time. I am going to be looking for a different swing which is sad because my son has loved using this one. He likes being able to pull on the fish and turn on the lights and music. It's a great swing except for that little problem. I just think for that kind of money, everything should work."
1,Would think twice about recommending this,"because....My little guy could not sit without being squished. The seat does not recline back AT ALL which means you can't put a baby in it until they can hold their head up well. Even after that, if they fall asleep you are back to the slumping head. The only reason I bought this product was because it was such a good deal (on sale) but, I would never pay full price and am even debating returning it! Its really a shame because most Fisher Price products are so good but, stay away fromo this one! Trust me."
3,If only the handle bar lifted...,"I have a 2 month old that is finally getting to like the swing more and more. It's pretty nice. Not too bulky and not too heavy.The flaws:-I wish the handle bar would open so I can easily carry my baby in and out of it. It's really diffult to get her in and out of the swing-The swing is too fast at the lowest speed-I wish we had the option of just using the lights without the music, if it does have that feature, mine doesn't work"
3,Shoddy Construction; Prone To Breakdown!,"Over the months, ALL Fisher-Price products we purchased either broke way prematurely, or fell short in functionality due to poor design. For example, the 'Aquarium Bouncer' (bubbles and moving fish/starfish) failed to work after only a few weeks. The 'Aquarium Cradle Swing' goes much too fast for an infant, even on their slowest setting. Fisher-Price's solution... weigh the swing down with a towel or rag!!! How utterly laughable and pathetic. The 'Aquarium Take Along Swing' is a great idea, but poor in execution and quality. The movable overhead handle gets in the way of placing baby in and out of the swing, and the frame itself sways dangerously, even though our 3 month old infant is only 14 pounds. A light went out as well only after a day's usage!!! Fisher-Price has some great ideas; if only they could execute their design and manufacturing a lot better. They need to hire much better designers that are more intuitive, practical, and safety-minded."
2,Not what we expected,"We have the full size aquarium swing which we LOVE. So we bought this swing for trips to grandma's and for daycare. But ever since we have gotten it we have been very dissapointed. First, the babies feet are higher then her head when she is in it, she does not like the position at all. Second, she is now 14 pounds and the swing hardly moves.... She does like the lights but they only hold her attention for a very short time. The hanging fish are a complete waste they don't attract her attention at all. Now as other reviewers have said there is somewhat of a safety hazzard when they babies start to squirm they can easily wiggle to left or right and end up getting hit by the arm. Since the only time we use the swing is at my mom's and if we do she is right in front of us, we have caught her and centered her again. I would not recommended this swing it needs to be redesigned...Not worth the $69 dollars we paid. Also it was a huge pain to assemble..."
3,Don't waste your time,"I was excited at first about this swing because it was easy to pack-up and take to the grandparent's houses. That is the only good thing about it. My daughter hates it. After only a minute or two in it she cries and wants no part of it. It is over-all kind of boring, and there are much better swings and bouncy chairs out there. Spend a little more money and get a swing that can swing in two different directions, or even a vibrating bouncy seat is better."
4,Couldn't live without it,"Our daughter LOVES her swing. We chose this one because we don't have a lot of space for the larger swings and we travel to Grandpop's and Gamma's home a lot. Once I figured it out, it was easy to fold up and throw into the car. Our daugher will sleep for hours in this...a feat only accomplished at night and when she naps beside or on me. Without this, she would only take brief naps and I could get nothing done. Plus, she would be a terror without the sleep.My only reservation is that we have been using it for about 3 1/2 months and the green light has gone out. I am trying to find out how to fix that and hoping that the others won't do the same.Overall, well worth the money - I never thought it was too expensive - and a great addition to my daughter's activities."
2,"Swings too fast, bad angle??",My child gets frustrated and nausated on this swing. I think it's because he's tilted back too far and it goes too fast. He does much better with the side-to-side swinging motion of his ocean aquarium swing. I had big hopes for this swing but my baby really dislikes it.
5,"Portable, fun, easy to use swing!!!",This swing is GREAT! My son LOVED to sit in it and watch the lights and listen to the music. I kept this at work with me when he was coming to work with me.The problems people are having with it being too uprights is probably because they don't have the seat properly put together! I had the same problem and once I looked over the instructions realized it was user error!It is very portable. You can collapse it with little effort. It isn't very bulky. It would fit in the back of my mini-van with no problems and plenty of room for other things!
2,Please read this review before you purchase this item....,"Our son fell sideways in last years version of this swing and receive a small red bump on his forehead(because his head got stuck in between the white part of the swing and the back blue bar). I have since returned the swing to Fisher-Price for a full refund. The three point harness is not very sufficient for smaller babies. You have to end up packing blankets around your baby to keep him/her from falling from side to side and hanging toys(which are not removable) tend to whack smaller babies in the head while swinging. The lights and music are very entertaining. Good Luck with this one. Hopefully this version is better, although it looks exactly the same, just different colors."
1,WARNING!,"Warning, my sone got his head and arm stuck between the sides and since it does not cradle a baby very well, he has fallen forward as is is moving!!I returned it as soon as he fell forward! he just doesn't sit right in it, there is NO support!Doe not fold up as small as I thought and the construction is not sturdy. over all, I was increadably disapointed for a Fisher Price product."
3,Convenient for Travel,"I got the swing as a gift. My baby didn't not care for it in the beginning. After a few tries, he now enjoys it. He loves the lights on the bar, the volume for the music is loud enough to be heard, and offers a variety of speed settings. It's convenient to take with you to visit family.The problem is that now at 14 lbs. The swing barely rocks at top speed.I was concerned with one incident. The toys are located on the sides. I once saw my baby lock his fingers around one of the toys and slightly lift himself up. My baby is only 3 months now. For my peace of mind, the toys have been removed."
1,too loud,"I purchased this swing since my daughter (11 weeks) will only sleep in her papasan swing, and I didnt want to have to move that from room to room. Well, the swing works ok, not a lot of power. The real issue is that it is loud. It makes a clicking sound that when there is noise in the room is not that loud, but when it is quiet at night, wakes her right up. The papasan swing is soooo much quieter so we are just going to purchase another for our bedroom."
5,This is the only swing you need,"We received both this swing and a full size Ocean Wonders swing for our baby. Although we enjoyed the full size one immensely, this one would have been enough. It is so easy to move around the house, and it was a lifesaver for trips to the grandparents and for camping before our daughter was mobile. She loved the lights, which was something the full size one didn't have. The seat was very comfortable, although we do not use swings for sleeping. It folded up very easily and fit in the back of our SUV very nicely with much other gear in tow."
4,My daughter enjoys the music,This is a nice swing that takes up little space -- my daughter enjoys the music and sits in her swing when I have to multitask. I haven't traveled with it yet but it looks easy enough.
2,Has its moments,"I have to say that this item is wonderful at times when it comes to keeping my 3 month old occupied. She really enjoys the lights and soothing music (which sometimes manages to sooth her to sleep) Unfortunately when I want to move her from the swing to the crib I end up waking her up because its so hard with that huge bar in the way! Its a miracle I havent hit her head yet. You also have to be careful not to run into it too hard, that happened with mine and now it doesnt want to swing at times unless i push it around a little. Also when it comes to smaller babies make sure to keep an eye on them, i placed the swing on its lowest speed level and my daughter was swinging back and forth like crazy, you have to wait until they're at least ten pounds for it to work right."
3,BEWARE OF FALLING FISH!,"My daughter loved this swing until she was 8 weeks old and was able to swat & grab at objects in front of her. She grabbed the dangling fish (at 8 weeks old) and it broke off the ribbon and smacked her square in the head! I contacted Fisher Price and they wanted the swing back to look at it. They sent me a postage paid sticker, but it was my job to find a box and take it to the post office. Mind you that the box couldn't exceed certain measurments required by Fisher Price. They also mailed me a check several weeks later for the ""suggested retail price"" which was about $10 less than I paid. So, after I spent hours trying to find the perfect box, I had to find someone to babysit while I took the gigantic box to the post office. All that to get shorted $10 and be without a swing. I liked the convenience of the take a long model, but the big swings fold up too. I like that the big swings are taller. Good Luck!"
1,Not accurate,I bought 2 of these to check the room temp/humidity and the temp/humidity in my guitar case. I was always puzzled by the wide variation in the humidity reading so I replaced both batteries and left them side by side for a few days. They consistently read a difference of more than 10% for the humidity reading.They are advertised as digitally accurate-they are not.
4,"Hilarious, even if you don't get the references","Let's face it. If you're looking at this product you're either a gamer yourself or intend to get it for a gamer. Even if you're not and you're just looking for something funny to watch, this will do the trick. The slightly obscure, irreverent characters and comedy can and do appeal to a wide variety of tastes. It's worth at least watching once, to say the least."
5,Zero budget and totally awesome,"I love the low budget 1950s sci fi movies. This is somehow reminiscent of these classics with ridiculously low production values, amateurism action but it doesn't take itself seriously at all. Avatar it isn't but if you're a dork, geek, poindexter or nerd, you'll find something here to enjoy and relate to."
5,"Better than the original, with more non-gamer appeal","I liked the original, but acknowledge it had little appeal to non-gamers. The ""sequel"" is longer and has a better plot that makes sense to non-gamers. My non-gaming girlfriend and father, along with several of my friends non-gaming SOs loved this movie; my girlfriend pushed to watch it multiple times within the first week of ownership.For gamers, you'll recognize people from your former (or even current) gaming groups; the attention starved ADHD gamer, the hack'n'slash gamer with pitiful luck, the rules lawyer/munchkin who throws a tantrum when he doesn't get his way, the ""pure"" role-player frustrated by the poor impulse control of the group, and the story-telling DM who tries to micromanage the game to match the story in his head.They play off each other beautifully, illustrating a gaming session that non-gamers and gamers alike can relate to. It's not high art, but its a damn good source of laughs on a rainy afternoon."
5,Exceedingly nice,"Really great actors. A must for all who love roleplay, especially for fans of the D&D or Pathfinder role play game."
5,Amazon has it wrong...,"I don't know how to get them to catch on, but despite the credits I finally got removed, and despite the reviews and comparisons listed, this is not, actually, the Red Shoe Diaries. It is an independent feature film that has nothing to do with the X-files, nothing to do with any of the reviews thus far... it's a comedic fantasy piece.For accurate information about the movie, visit www.the-gamers.com, or look it up on IMDB, or on the publisher's site or the distributor paizo."
4,not bad for a B movie,"As a huge dork I enjoyed the inside jokes. You have to know the game of D&D to really appreciate it, otherwise, you'll think it's very, very nerdy."
1,Duh! This is a very good movie.,"A friend of a friend got this one for me. And boy, am I glad!This movie makesThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Extended Edition + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] look like an episode ofPunky Brewster - Season One.Wow! It's amazing. Imaginative and witty.I'm really glad I finally got to watch it!"
2,Not thay great,The price was great ... but the mp3 player wasnt what I would have expected from rca. The look is very nice and slim. the big problem is that the stinkin thing wont hold a charge. it only lasts for about 45 minutes fully charged. I would not recommend this item.
2,line-in mp3 player,"This is an older model Mp3 player that I bought only because it has line-in record capability. Hard to find that feature on players these days. The capacity is only 1 gig and it records in wave format. I convert recorded programs to Mp3 and put them on newer, higher capacity players, for listening while I work at my boring job.NEW REVIEW: IT IS NOW 9-21-11 AND THE THING JUST STOPPED WORKING. CANT RE-INSTALL UPDATE OR FIRMWARE BECAUSE COMPUTER WILL NOT SEE IT. TRIED EVERYTHING, IT IS GONE, WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR. IF YOU HAVE ONE, DO NOT RELY ON IT."
5,my fav cd,"this 1 cd has gotten more play on my cd players than any i have ever owned. i had bought f.t.t.w and thicker than water a while ago and then i finally found this one, it is the best cd i have ever owned. the other two are excellent also but this one seems to stand out as my favorite and i couldn't imagine a cd collection without this cd. all the songs kick."
1,Bored Senseless,"This novel is even more trite, than the authors boring monologues on mail order brides. Rather than familiarize the reader with the subject matter at hand, the author pumps her own ego repeatedly. What I did find amusing were the multiple references to the author's own homoerotic, incestuous, and pediphilific tendencies. In a word this novel blows. literally."
3,Dance Until You Drop,"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were a wonderful on-screen pair and everyone loved their simple charm. I think Baxt captures that charm in this little book. Like all of his celebrity mysteries, this is a satire, and I think it portrays the McCarthy hearings quite well. Life in Hollywood in 1953 was difficult and everyone looked at everyone else to try to figure our whether or not they were ""commies"". In this book we see Fred and Ginger smack in the middle of a Russian espionage scam. Ginger's therapist dies and Villon and Mallory know that he was poisoned. What's his background and history? They find out and its a world of double agents, family rivalries and Communist underworld. Of course Villon figures it out, but even he is surprised to find out who the ""kingpin"" is."
3,Watch the dates!,"As with most books that claim to encompass the entire 19th century, I caution the reader to beware and to always watch the dates. This book covers the Regency era and a good portion of the Victorian era, but what happens in the 1820s isn't necessarily what happens in the 1840s and readers looking for historical background to their favorite novels, and writers wanting to start researching a new period, need to be wary. But Margetson is a competent writer and the book is very entertaining and informative."
5,Reminicent of the first time I played Warcraft...great!,"What a fantastic game -- I am a die-hard fan of the real-time strategy genre, and never thought I'd ever match the goosbumps I got the first time I played Warcraft years ago. Starcraft came close (I still play that game with my brother-in-law online...timeless), Kohan and C&C Red Alert 2 were fun while they lasted, but Battle Realms really does take the cake. Who'd have thought that Ubi Soft, notorious for releasing horribly untested games, would make something as great as BR? True, the game does have a slight tendency to bomb occasionally, but a patch should fix that shortly. BR's 4 clans are extremely well-balanced and unique with special ""battle gear"" that improves combat acumen. Populations are limited to 30 -- including your peasant class -- and there are built-in discouragements to the rush tactic. I know you don't know me, but trust me: it you've ever liked an RTS game, you owe it to yourself to check out Battle Realms."
3,"Great graphics, but beyond that....NOT THAT MUCH REALLY !!!","The game has got excellent graphics and superb animation of the characters. Yet, the gameplay gets too boring after a while.There are hardly any real strategies in that game. You simply build an army and then they hack teh enemy to pieces or get done themselves by the enemy.Also the game has almost no defense buidings like gun turrets, towers or walls which make it impossible to build a good base or to defend teh buildings. It also takes a lot of tactical aspects out of the game.Battle realms has a lot of cool features, but it lacks everything that makes a true entertaining RTS game. AOK for example is still fun playing after more than a 100 hours. The same applies to Starcraft. These new 3d RTS games try to impress the player with graphics, but have nothing more to offer."
2,Modern software,"Terrain Graphics and Unit movement Ai are good, but that is about it. The concept of unit alchemy, which is where a unit trains in one building and then another to become more powerful is fairly unique but little else is offered. UNit graphics and animations are dull and uninspired. The game has bugs and little balance. The sound and music are pathetic albeit amusing from time to time. The interface is a crime against gamers. There is a fourty unit population limit and the game grates along slowly anyway. Players are limited to four towers, which are far from impressive. Battle gear and other upgrades can be aquires just like unit alchemy, but fail to make up for the glaring shortcomings of this game.Overall Reveiw. 2 Stars and a waste of money. Buy Warlords Battlecry 1 or 2."
4,Not your father's RTS,"Very different and very fun. Don't play this game with a mind jaded by years of Age of Empires and Starcraft. It's a fun, interesting game that's not for the micromanager. It looks beautiful and plays fast and chaotic. Gets better with every Battle Pack."
5,It is the 2nd best RTS game around,"While it may not be Age of Empires but it certainly is a brillant game. Like any game it has its flaws, but these flaws are easily ignored. The good parts about the game are simply over whelming. The amount of strategys you can have, the level of detail in the game and the the great maps(and now editor).I recommend this game to anyone who can win games without cheating, there are no cheats in this game. Battle Realms creators have fixed all the bugs in the game (well that they know of at least) and now its a brillant game. ]P.S-C+C Renegade is better"
5,Inspiring!,"As a physician who is interested in working for MSF, this documentary gives an insight into what the lives of the doctors working for MSF are like. Highly inspiring documentary indeed!"
2,Not what I expected!,"I've never read one her novels, but this was certainly not what I expected. I've put the book down after completing just the first four chapters. Although it seemed to be moving at a fast pace, to me it totally lacked any form of depth in regards to its characters.The story line she chose is a good one, and with that I feel she could have expounded more on her characters interaction with each other right from the beginning. As hard as I tried I just could not get into the characters, they seemed so unrealistic. Their words and actions were almost laughable.The only way that I will finish this book is if I have absolutely nothing else to read. If you simply go by the back-cover you will more than likely be duped like me into purchasing it. Don't do it if you haven't already...stop and reassess the situation."
2,Possible but not likely,"This book has great possibilities with its storyline and characters, unfortunately that's about it. I found it hard to get into this book. Before the first few pages are over, the characters (complete strangers) are all over each other and it's a little difficult to understand why this even happening. There is little background to help you understand why or how these characters should come together, except that they're both beautiful. Their actions and conversations were unreal. No one talks in that manner. In addition, the female character got on my nerves. She's got this great guy who is willing to do anything for her and she runs off and acts childish through most of the book. Hopefully the next book will be better plotted and thought out."
5,Love at first sight,"When I read Island Interlude, I couldnt put the book down. This is a romance book for the summer season. It was well written and an easy story-line. There was a little mystery in store. I loved this book with 2 thumbs up!!!!"
4,Amazing ending!,"This was a great book. As a slow reader, this book really caught my attention, I read this book over night. It's amazing how an author can write so much drama from tragic events in his life but yet still put a little bit of laughter in his work. I felt for Carter and Peggy and the determination Carter had. But really loved Giani, again its great to smile a bit. Can't wait to read your next book. Don't make us wait to long."
1,1.44? No way!,"I have a 20-pack of these floppies, and only one came anywhere close to 1.44 meg capacity. Several maxed out at less than 500 kb. Even deleting all the files on one of them did not restore full capacity.Totally unsat."
1,Imation should be off the market,"I can no longer access most of my files saved on imation disks! When I want to save a file on a brand new imation disk, it cannot do so! The message tells me that the file cannot be saved on the disk & it's a brand new disk!!Even though imation shows capacity of 1.44MB, it's really 1.38MB.Imation is very unreliable & a waste of money!!"
4,gary's review of audio technica at450 microphone,"I was looking for a microphone that would work well to pick up the barrel of a clarinet. Studied lots of microphones and pickup patterns, microphone types on line. I decided on this microphone because it has a cardoid pickup pattern, and what seems to be an adequate amount of sensitivity to pick up the barrel of the clarinet from about 4 to 5 inches away from the instrument. I probably could use a little more sensitivity, but am concerned about feedback problems, being in an extrememly lively sound stage situation. I tried it at home with an amplifier and small speaker, but have not given it the acid test, which is on stage. Wish me luck!---------Gary"
4,Good game...wish there were more boards,"My daughter, who's 4, loved this game. It's kinda like Bingo with a twist. It's easy to learn and fun to play. The only problem I have found with it is that it only comes with two game boards. Not nearly enough for a family game. The quality of the boards also leaves a little something to be desired. They are made out of heavy cardboard with removable pieces that will be used in the game. When I removed the pieces on one of the boards, a small tear occurred. Not too bad, but I thought this could have been done a little better. Overall, though, I would recommend it to others with preschool children."
1,Karloff's Cinematic Wasteland,"From a celluloid perspective, the 1950s were a terrible decade for Boris Karloff. Though he blazed new trails on television and stage, the Hollywood studios could not provide a memorable vehicle for this truly great actor. ""Frankenstein 1970"" (1958) represented the worst of a largely forgotten lot. Portraying an atomic-age, Nazi-scarred version of Baron Frankenstein was an opportunity Karloff should have avoided. The only interesting aspect is the bizarre ""twist"" ending - if you can wait that long. Happily, the 1960s would provide more rewarding film roles for Karloff, culminating in his masterful triumph as Byron Orlok in ""Targets."""
4,This book is Way KewL!,"This book is one of the Best for many reasons. The layout is very nice. The pages are of high quality paper..(kinda like laminated). The Pictures are the Best i've ever seen! If there is one thing i love about this book its the pics.. some of the amazing pics in this book include... the purple A.seemani.. A.geniculata.. A very nice picture of the P.regalis, etc etc etc. buy this book..!"
5,Great Book to have as a collector,I love poetry and this Book on nineteenth century american classics is must have for any one who reads books. This is a keeper and a collectors must have book. M coleman
2,Disappointed with this film.,I expected much better from Cuba Gooding. In my view it was a waste of his time to make the movie; and it was most certainly a waste of my time to watch it. There was no substance to it.
1,Don't waste your time!,"This may very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. After watching this, I felt like I had wasted an hour and a half of my life. The acting is boring. There really is no action as expected by the title and cover. The movie ends with numerous unanswered questions. I kept watching expecting the plot to resolve. It didn't. By the time the credits finally appeared, I was disappointed and confused. Don't watch it."
1,Don`t buy or rent this film,That must be one of the worst films i have ever seen and i have seen a lot. Yes it is THAT bad.
2,For the Love of Cuba..,"$5 blu-ray should've been a clue to the quality of this movie. Not much else can be said that hasn't been said in other reviews already. I bought it for no other reason than Cuba. Mildly shocking was seeing Bobby Lashley getting beat up by Cuba in a bare knuckle fight. Storyline was only confusing if you think about it to hard. Revenge seemed to be the main plot point. Sub plot was the ""are they mercs, spooks, spec ops"" & what are they going after. Special features are, well, there are none. Well you get what you pay for."
4,inconvenient truth : the hero is alive,"The guy who killed the ace of spades... declared dead by the president's manon national TV, comes home to a less than hero's welcome?What does this hero know that is so dangerous to those in power?He only wants the money he was promised and to live.He is telling no stories or converting no lies.It is confusing... who are the real bad guys?The guys in the black hats or the ones in the white hats?Maybe we get to find out... The acting is goodand the streets are a danger in D.C."
1,Not a movie,Way too many flashbacks and it was very slow in getting to the plot. Did I say plot? There is not one. I think Cuba better the screenplay a bit closer and make better decisions as to what he put his name on. What a waste of media.
2,Not my cup of tea,Wasn't thrilled with this movie..lost interest real quick.Not the best acting and seemed to drag out.I'm not real impressed with Cuba Gooding Jr. as an actor so that didn't help.Over all I have to give it a low rating...
1,Completely Awful,"This movie lurches along from one senseless plot twist to another like a drunk having a blackout. I watched it for free on NetFlix and still felt cheated. The luckiest actor in the movie is the guy who comes on in the fake mustache and vampire outfit who gets his face covered with a shower curtain and then stabbed in the tongue; he's in and out of the movie fast, like I should have been. I will give this mess credit for one thing; it may have the most implausible fight choreography ever in the scene where Cuba Gooding ""defeats"" a hyper-steroidal jock by dint of his mad ninja ""duck every time the jock swings"" move. Don't waste your time. The soundtrack could have been improved greatly by giving more time to Bill ""Howl-N-Madd"" Perry, who has a small speaking role along with playing on the stage at the bar."
1,Confusing story at best,"I could never figure out what happened first or next because the timeline goes back and forth during the whole movie. I could never figure out who Cuba Gooding was working for. Was he a soldier or a merc? Wasn't clear. If he was special forces, he needs to go back to school to learn how to clear a room. Also, don't they teach these guys about noise discipline? Why were they just yakking away in the middle of indian country like a bunch of newbs? Professional operators use hand signals."
1,ENGLISH closed captions - what a joke,"This could have been an interesting movie but it just wasn't. The ENGLISH closed captions did not match or came WAY AFTER the actors spoke their lines, making it impossible to watch. If you are deaf or hearing impaired do not bother to rent or purchase this film.I like Cuba Gooding Jr but this was a big disappointment."
1,Tripe!,"If you need to think the worst about the US government, this movie is for you. The premise that high officials including the president are in collusion with Osama Bin Laden and that government assassins roam the country killing citizens Putin style is abhorrent. That said the movie is simply not believable. The action scenes came from the imagination of one who has never been near combat. I like Cuba Gooding, but he demeaned himself by being part of this outrage. I gave it one star because nagative stars are not an option."
1,Not a good movie.,"This movie was horrible. I like Gooding Jr., but this is some of his worst work. I was lost from the beginning."
2,mostly for the people into pulp,"that's right. subtle changes, a few details. this can be interesting for a pulp fan, but not much for us whp just like good stories. some stories were almost interesting, but were for different reasons hard to digest (like these supernatural investigators in old detective novel style). some of the stories really lacked suspence. ah, they come by the thousand. get the uzi. no, that's more of a script for an action movie. i like good pulp. this is not agood collection"
1,Inferior item; will NOT buy again,"I bought these because I could not find a pair in Walmart which is where I normally buy them for my elderly mother who uses them to pick things up around the house or in her room. I was so happy to find a pair of these that were identical to the red handled ones that I bought her before, I thought maybe the blue handled ones were a NEWER design sadly that was not the case. I got these today and when I pulled them out of the box and pushed the little button on the center of them to lock them in place and keep them from bending the things STILL bent and even bent side to side which they should NOT do at all. They don't lock right handle wise either and when they do you can't get them unlocked. I'm VERY disappointed with these and the only reason I'm not returning them is because I'm going to scrap them and fix a pair of the red handled ones which need new suction cups. But yeah I will NEVER EVER buy these things again."
3,LIGHTweight grabber,"It is a wonderful tool for light weight items and I mean light weight, don't try to pick Anythingheaver than a sock ."
1,Cheap and crappy,This thing broke within 2 days? The pin to fold in f fell out had to but ate on t to hold it in place.
2,poor quality,"I need this tool. The early ones worked well. Those selling todays goods hsvre accepted much poorer quaity to sell. The tool will no longer pick up a dime. Looks the same, it's not."
3,Cheap construction.,The unit is made very cheaply. It works but plastic part broke after short while. I fixed and now works OK.
1,item sucks,This item broke the second time i went to use it. The cooection that goes from the handle to the end snapped.
1,weak construction,"i was so excited to get this; one for home, one for work. first time i went to use 1, it snapped. the wire inside busted and i had to throw away [...] plus shipping. i'm now looking for a stronger one. i was only trying to lift up a piece of mail!"
2,Ok,Not great quality it works ok! The gripper cups are a hard plastic so doesnt pick up thinkg like another tpe I have had before. Ok in a pinch but it not worth the money paid. I had to duck tape the cups on because the screw kept coming out!
2,Heavy,"I have a neuromuscular disease and am in a power chair. I can't live without reachers in every room. I constantly drop things that I can't reach from my chair. This brand of reacher is way too heavy for me.I have found the ""Nova reachers"" the best. They're very light (24-42"") and the full hand trigger is easy and I find the hook very useful. It also hangs most anywhere. Also, they don't lock which is more of a benefit than detriment...the locking is a pain. Check them out before you buy.Nova Reacher - 32 Inch Dragon, Brushed Aluminum.Nova Reacher Dragon 24 Inch, Silver/black"
1,Threw it in the Garbage after it fell apart,It only lasted a couple months and then the rubber cups wouldn't open so you couldn't drop the item. And then the folding part broke and I decided not to try to fix it. Went into the garbage can.
1,Poor quality,"Within one month the gripper snapped and fell apart. The suction cups are made of plastic and not rubber. Hence, it made it difficult to pick up items. I would not recommend this product at all!"
3,pick up,I use these tools when I walk on the side of the Autobahn (the nationally coordinated motorway system in Germany) in Germany. I find many dead rodents that I pick up and store in a bag. I usually take them home to prepare if they're not too damaged. I also use it to pick up bottles of whiskey (I siphon the leftover whiskey in each bottle to form a full bottle) or cans so I can recycle them.Unfortunately the quality of this brand is really not that good.
4,Good for those of us who have back problems,"I have trouble some days when trying to bend down to pick up things. My cats play with their toys throughout the house and I must go along picking them up before I can vacuum. This is one of the times I find the gripper handy. Also, my cupboards are high and I am not--so I wash the grips and use them to gather items from dishes to cans from my cupboards. It is equally handy when putting dishes back in the cupboard after being washed. I wash the grips often and the soap and water has no detrimental effect on the rubber grips. I would highly recommend this gripper for those who need a little help."
2,tips fall off,"forget this style. I have tried three of them. After about 3 months of occasional use, one or both of the rubber cups on the ends, will fall off. Period. Frame is sturdy, but that is not the most important part. I finally switched to a heavier extender, with heavy-duty rubber ends."
2,It works but,"Its a cheap one , could have been a little better built . A little thin in the plastic handle ."
2,Bought this for a coworker,I was getting some reachers for myself to use after surgery and a coworker asked me to get one for he. I am assuming she likes it but I also got one like this for me and it broke the first time I used it.
2,Fair pick up tool,"RecievedReceived two pick up grippers, one was in original box and other was wrapped in a plastic bag, I have had other pick up tools that are the same type but these tools are cheaply made knock off's. The one that was wrapped in plastic had a minor defect and it looks like it was returned without the original package and resent out with a defect, the price is low but it looks like you get what you pay for."
1,INFERIOR PRODUCT-FOLDING GRABBER,"I purchased two of these Grabbers and both had serious problems. In the middle of the bar there is a mechanism to lock the length in place. On one of the units the button that you push to lock it was rolling around in the box and had to be repaired, which I did. When you squeeze the trigger on the other one the suction cups close and won't release the item you picked up. This happens each time you use the grabber without sliding the lock that allows you to hold an item without continuing to squeeze the trigger. I would not advise anyone to purchase this grabber."
2,Cheap and flimsy,This grabber is flimsy and cheaply made.Other similar products are much better made than this one and cost only $5 more.
2,Shipping costs more than item!!!!,"Silly to pay a little over six bucks for something you can pick up at the hardware store for about the same price, then pay nearly eight bucks to have it shipped. I will buy local Thanks anyway"
1,Don't buy this reacher!,"I'll give it one star because it does reach some things. However it isn't long enough or strong enough to be of any use. Oh you can pick up a tissue, some trash, but to actually reach for something with any weight or to use it above, forget it.the fact that it folds, sort of, makes it worse, because it doesn't really stay folded. Skip this reacher altogether."
1,Unhappy Customer,As soon as I saw it I knew it was poorly made and not even worthy of a 1-star rating but they made me rate it. It wouldn't take much to make this product better; they had a good idea but didn't go far enough.
2,Not very substantial,"The idea that this product was collapsible was the reason I bought it. However, the mechanism that allows it to collapse is very unstable and....wobbly, for want of a better word. I had my son glue it in place so I could use it without worrying if it would collapse when I was picking something up."
